   "Due to the repeated argument I needed to clear up the issue. I don't have time to repeat this argument with new comers all the time.\n \n Affirmative action is not reverse discrimination! It's preferential treatment.\n \n Affirmative action I like to call affirmative consideration (in consideration of their wrong of the past) is preferential treatment such as we do when give preferential treatment to those who qualify for public assistance and Americans with disabilities (ADA).\n \n Example of discrimination:\n \n Black man walks into the diner, they say you can't come in here because you're black. Everyone else receives the same treatment. The man's treatment is based upon his skin color. That's discrimination.\n \n Example of preferential treatment\n \n Black man walks into the diner, they say come sit here in our best booth because you're black. Everyone else is treated the same. The treatment is based upon his skin color. \n \n How can one be discrimination to whites and the other not? Discrimination is based upon your skin color. If you apply to college and they giver preference to a minority then it's becaue of his skin color not yours. You can say it's because you're white but it reality it's because they are a minority. If they weren't in the pool of applicants it would be a non-issue. If you were discriminated then regardless who else is in the pool they would push you back based upon your skin color.\n \n Now we giver preferential treatment to the disabled and poor not because they are inherently inferior but they are disadvantged. The definition of disabled is someone that is disadvantaged compared to not disabled person. \n \n Social programs is preferential treatment of those that are economically disadvantaged.\n \n Americans with disabilities act (ADA)- people that are disadvantaged physically.\n \n Affirmative Action (or Affirmative COnsideration)- Those taht have been disadvantaged because of their race or/and culture.\n \n \n The Law of Torts\n \n \n In General (individual's rights)\n \n 1. right to be free from bodily harm\n \n 2. right to enjoy a good reputation\n \n 3. right to conduct business with out wrongful interference\n \n 4. right to have property free from interference\n \n \n \n A Tort is interference with another's right by:\n \n 1. intent\n \n 2. negligence\n \n 3. strict liability\n \n \n \n The injured party sues the defendant or tort feasor.\n \n 1. Brought in civil court\n \n 2. Seek damages\n \n 3. Not necessarily a crime\n \n 4. Standard - preponderance of the evidence (i.e. more likely than not\n \n \n The government by allowing:\n \n Slavery- before 1865\n \n \"Separate but equal\" 1896 doctrine that authorized apartheid that was already existent and continued to exist until 1969\n \n Jim Crow laws- 1865-1969( south); before 1969 ( the rest of the country because even though they weren't slaves they treated minorities as second class [including Asians, Native Americans, Hispanics, and all other minorities])\n \n The slaughter of 90% of native Hawai'ians.\n \n The theft of Hawai'i.\n \n The unfair treatment of Hawai'ians compared to other indigineous people that inhabited the US.\n \n Racial internments of minorities during World War II.\n \n Repeated failure to stop discrimination- Through out the country before 1969 civil rights act\n \n Failure to protect civil rights- through out the country before 1969\n \n The government killed 95% of native americans and stole their land\n \n The government pacified native Americans with alcohol because it was easier than fighting them.

Show that they were negligent.\n \n Gross negligence- When someone shows reckless disregard in acting. When someone shows gross negligence then they are not only held liable for compensation but also for punative damages to ensure that they won't do it again.\n \n The government in allowing widespread discrimination and for failure to protect the rights of minorities under the 14th amendment showed reckelss disregard for their duty.\n \n Intentional Tort- when a party intends to cause harm. The US intended to casue harm when they enacted segregation by \"the separate but equal doctrine\" . They also intended to keep the segregated facilites unequal in Federal buildings, the military, federally funded schools, and all other divisions of the government including denying citizens the right to vote.\n \n Now we can debate these arguments once and for all because I hate redoing it with new comers.

You, like many young people (I suppose you are young, you sound like it &#8211; if not I apologize) are fed up with what was done years ago to &#8220;correct&#8221; the longstanding racial problem. It started out innocent, but wound up&#8230;well, what you see today. But, it is my opinion, since I have seen the failures of AA, is that a system needs to be installed to educate people about the problem rather than trying to &#8220;iron-fist&#8221; it. But, the first thing to do is promote responsibility awareness. Without responsibility nothing else will work. After responsibility is implemented then the education process can begin.\n For anyone to think that one human being, because of skin color, deserves more or less than another, or that that person is inferior/superior, or has special rights, is due to lack of education. That, mana&#8217;ia is, and has been, the root of the problem all along.\n \n Isn&#8217;t it a shame that something so simple has been blown so out of proportion?\n \n The trick is getting anyone to notice it, or to care about responsibility.

You're so blinded by self-pity that you cannot, or refuse to, see the reality of situation. Here you are, obviously an intelligent young man, a man who will no doubt be very successful, a man with a leg up on 90% of society, and you are too absorbed in your \"disadvantages\" to see just how \"advantaged\" you truly are.\n \n The facts about AA are plain and simple, and no amount of rationalization or semantics is going to change that reality. The sooner we get over race, as a factor for or against, the sooner the playing field will truly be level, and the only way to eliminate race, is to level the playing field. Clear as mud.\n \n As for your legal presentation, I'd suggest it was \"flimsy\" at best, but closer to irrelevent. I doubt you'd get that past your professors (mind you, they have molded you this far), let alone an actual judge. If there was any merit to it all, it would have been born out in the courts years ago.\n\n \n Waxy I consider you one of of the better adversarial advocates. I think it's because you hav always maintained your maturity.I do however consider you views very skewed and bias as I know you see mine. I have some fundamental disagreements with you about certain views.\n \n first off I'm not about self pity. I'm about equality. I know life is not fair but this country is about equality. I have faced it and I know almost if not all minorities face it. Most don't think about the disadvantages because they have faced it for so long just as many with disabilities don't think about it in some instances.\n \n I fight for those that don't have the ability of do not feel that they can win. I made it despite the challenges I face. I don't need the government to give me anything. I would make it regardless the price I'd have to pay. I know of diabled people that would crawl up steps and pull their chair behind them before ADA. They would make it regardless. Is it fair? Of course not. People are willing to give up parking spots everyday. They're willing to pay thousands extra to make their buildings accessible. They're willing to allow people to the front of the line at amusement parks. Yet they won't sacrifice the POSSIBILITY of being passed over for an admissions spot or job. That's what is so hard to believe. They are willing to accommodate people that were not injured through not fault of the government in most cases but not willing to help those that have been injured by the government and \"white male\" america. That is what it's about. It's not about self pity it's about equality.",

Regardless of whether that reaction is just or unjust, it IS happening and will continue to happen as long as minorities push for race-conscious policies.\n \n Moreover, tell me why it is considered legitimate for minorities to push for their interests, causes, consciousness, and to encourage their racial identity and solidarity, but when whites react to that by beginning to imitate that strategy, it is called \"racism\" as you just called it? \n \n This is the most blatant kind of hypocrisy and double standard. Whites as a group are in favor of a race-blind society. If minorities keep racializing the country, whites will in the long term become racialized as well.

   "Thinking people today very often confuse how things should be with how they are. What you are saying is that white people should not respond to affirmative action by becoming race conscious and imitating the racial agenda of minorities. Regardless of whether that reaction is just or unjust, it IS happening and will continue to happen as long as minorities push for race-conscious policies.\n \n Moreover, tell me why it is considered legitimate for minorities to push for their interests, causes, consciousness, and to encourage their racial identity and solidarity, but when whites react to that by beginning to imitate that strategy, it is called \"racism\" as you just called it? \n \n This is the most blatant kind of hypocrisy and double standard. Whites as a group are in favor of a race-blind society. If minorities keep racializing the country, whites will in the long term become racialized as well. Minorities do not have the long-term option of fighting to advance their power while whites either push for that as well or adopt the attitude of color-blindness. The long term trend will be toward race-blindness for ALL groups or balkanization with whites pushing for their group as much as minorities push for theirs. Minorities would be wise to submit themselves to the color-blindness they demand of whites before it becomes too late and whites turn to race consciousness.\n\n Since the majority including many of you see minorities as disadvantaged then it makes sense to have support groups. That is what these organiations are about supporting people taht struggle with what others don't.\n \n How would rape victims feel is they made support groups or groups for non-rape victims?

These urban areas don't finance athletic programs that they can play in because there is lack of funding. So many of them don't get the opportunity to play.

And whites still receive overwhelmingly most of them.\n \n \n \n\n Sure, let's use your source too.\n http://www.ncaa.org/library/research/race_demographics/2001-02/2001-02_race_demo.pdf\n In Division I \"Money Sports\", blacks represent over 50% of the scholarship athletes participating.

A football athlete can't receive anymore of a scholarship than any other sport. There may be more shcolarships in a sport but a full football, basketball, baseball, can pay as much as a full swimming, golf, fencing and any other full ride sport. How is that relevant?\n \n The other story is sad about college athletes. Most college athletes are admitted becasue of their athletic ability. The low graduation rate isn't because of them not being capable (even though some aren't) ti's because some athletes feel their ticket is athletics, not school. Those athletes that come from good families can ground the athlete more and help them to focus on school. \n \n I agree their are problems with athletes but the argument is that athletic scholarships are given more to white by number and percentage.",

   "If the standard treatment is to eat in the basement then yes it would be preferentail treatment.\n \n \n \n That is not how affirmative action works. Anyways if you're regarding how they have disabled seating in fromt of subways and busses. It's based upon the ideal that they are so much more disadvantaged than you that it would be easier for you to move than to ask them to wheel themselves to the back of the bus. THe burden would be greater than you. \n \n Affirmative action would not make you move. It would allow for some to get in line first to allow them to get a seat first.\n \n \n \n That's true. However there is no refusal based upon your skin color. You weren't \"refused\" based upon your skin color. If you were then everyone wiht your skin color would have been \"refused\". You were refused because your application wasn't as good as everyone else of your skin color. SO the deciding factor wasn't skin because others of your skin were admitted the deciding factor was everything else.The seat was given to someone else because they had another skin color. Just everybody thinks they lost out when really it \"may\" only have happened to a few.\n\n \n \n \n So now the way you put it, whites compete against whites and blacks compete against blacks? That's how you make it sound when you say You were refused because your application wasn't as good as everyone else of your skin color\". You make some terrible comments. Preferential treatment is discrimination. The definition of discrimination is \"treatment or consideration based on class or category rather than individual merit\". Telling a black man he can have the finest booth in a restaurant because he's black is treating him different because he's black, not because of his merit. Look up the definition of discrimination before you apply it to your opinion of Affirmative Action. \n \n And you are right, you aren't refused because of your skin color. However, you are passed up because someone who is another color may be as good as you. When you allude to the bus situation, I don't quite agree with letting someone in line ahead of someone else because of race. Say a school admits 500 people. If you admit 50 blacks first, you have pretty much told 50 white people that they would have gotten in if it weren't for Affirmative Action, but they had to let 50 blacks in so they were passed up. Same as on a bus. What makes a black person so much better than a white person that he should be able to cut in line ahead of whites. Everyone today is complaining about EQUALITY. What you are proposing will totally defeat what we are trying to accomplish.",

   "So now the way you put it, whites compete against whites and blacks compete against blacks? That's how you make it sound when you say You were refused because your application wasn't as good as everyone else of your skin color\". You make some terrible comments. Preferential treatment is discrimination. The definition of discrimination is \"treatment or consideration based on class or category rather than individual merit\". Telling a black man he can have the finest booth in a restaurant because he's black is treating him different because he's black, not because of his merit. Look up the definition of discrimination before you apply it to your opinion of Affirmative Action. \n \n And you are right, you aren't refused because of your skin color. However, you are passed up because someone who is another color may be as good as you. When you allude to the bus situation, I don't quite agree with letting someone in line ahead of someone else because of race. Say a school admits 500 people. If you admit 50 blacks first, you have pretty much told 50 white people that they would have gotten in if it weren't for Affirmative Action, but they had to let 50 blacks in so they were passed up. Same as on a bus. What makes a black person so much better than a white person that he should be able to cut in line ahead of whites. Everyone today is complaining about EQUALITY. What you are proposing will totally defeat what we are trying to accomplish.\n\n \n I've heard that when Coretta Scott King (The Black Widow) flies commercial airlines, she insists that members of her party be the only ones in the first class lounge.

Mania said that preferential treatment was when a black person went into a restaurant, they would be given the best table because they were black. They wouldn't say the same for Coretta on a plane. They would politely ask people to leave. It would be the same if Alex Rodriguez was to use the first class. They would ask people to leave. So this issue has nothing to do with race, so I don't understand why you brought it up. They don't book the first class for her because she and her followers are black. My arguments to Mania were that his views of preferential treatment were discriminatory.

If everyone basically was treated poorly, nobody should have their own month. It's either everyone does or nobody does or else it is discrimination. Why do they deserve it and no other groups of people do? We (white Americans) were treated unfairly by the British in our own land, but we don't have our own month. Also, the people you describe that are being treated poorly were not treated poorly by the US, they were treated poorly by Germany, Stalin, etc. So what you are saying is totally irrelevant.

   "Believe it or not, I just read this entire thread from start to finish. Mana'ia, I'd like to address the big problem I have with your \"Preferential-good/Discrimination-bad\" argument.\n \n I understand the difference in terms of the definition you give out (preferential being a positive deviation from the \"norm\", discrimination being a negative deviation from the \"norm\"). However, I find prefrential treatment to be dangerous because it gives a far more effective tool for whites to perpetuate race-based oppression than discriminatory treatment does.\n \n The reason for this is that most overtly discriminatory laws and de jure instances of discrimination have been eliminated from our legal code. Whites often argue that this has effectively made us \"color-blind\" and that race shouldn't be a relevant characteristic anymore. In our past debates on this subject, you have pointed out that race still plays an important role in society that overwhelming harms members of subjegated races.\n \n However, since this racism is no longer de jure, what is it? I would answer that it is a mindset (usually not explicit) that views \"white\" views, actions, etc as either superior or just plain normative. In keeping with this mindset, we effectively give preferential treatment to whites on a daily basis, by upgrading them and viewing their actions as more worthy of praise or advancement. For example, \"drugs are bad\" is a norm in our society. However, punishment for powder cocaine is far less severe than for many other drugs (for example, crack). Implicitly, this is b/c powder coke is used predominatly by the white middle class (or at least is viewed that way). So while the use of powder coke is a tragic case of misguided young person who needs treatment and rehab, crack is viewed, like other drugs, as a symptom of urban blight and the user as a future (if not already) hardened criminal who needs to be locked up. The primary disadvantage for minorities in the US today is preferential treatment for whites rather than discriminatory action against blacks; the powers that be tend to unconsciously feel more comfortable with people who seem to have shared their experiences and perspectives, so they look first to whites when doling out the rewards they possess.\n \n What can we draw from this re: the \"preferential\" treatment that is AA? Several things:\n 1) pro-white \"preferential\" treatment is an imprecise analogy towards AA, but in a manner which actually makes AA worse in a way. AA manifests itself in a zero-sum game, that is, every additional spot given to the beneficiary is a spot taken away from someone else. Some pro-white pref treatment is also a zero sum game, but not all (for example, white bankers overlooking faults in white businessmen looking for a loan doesn't effectively preclude minority businessmen from getting there own loan, as generally there is more money available to loan then there are \"qualified\" lendees). This is NOT to suggest that white pref. treatment is better than AA. However, it does poke holes in the suggestion that AA is merely giving whites an \"explicit\" taste of their own medicine.\n 2) perpetuating pref. treatment (via AA) is dangerous to minorities b/c the logic behind it justifies equally pro-white pref. treatment which is the cause of most current race problems. As such, AA will end up having a net harmful effect on minorities even if it directly benefits them, the equivilent of 1 step forward, 3 steps back. I believe this is more dangerous than the more explicit \"discriminatory\" measures for several reasons. a) Since pref. treatment DOES provide a direct benefit to the disadvantaged group, it is easy to seduce minorities into buying into the ideology and thus blind them to the fact that the system it lies within is the root of the problem it purports to solve. b) Since the harms of pref. treatment to minorities are far less easy to see than those of discrimination, resistance is harder to muster amongst the oppressed and the oppressors can argue that there is no oppression at all. The non-explicit nature of pref. treatment harms makes it far more difficult to bring about the sort of collective guilt amongst the oppressors that makes change possible.\n 3) Solvency comes in the form of rejecting race based narratives all together. Since race is fundamentally an artificial construct, and not something that is fixed or static, it can and should be seen as creation of certain classes to subjugate the other. The non-fixed quality of race should be quite clear, Irishmen and Jews both used to be regarded as members of other races (some people claim they still are), but now are normally considered \"white.\" Working within the racial structure (as AA does) is self-defeating b/c any explicit attempt to aid the oppressed race reinforces the false notion within the oppressive race that blacks, latinos, asians, jews (whomever) are part of an \"other,\" not like me, and thus are threatening. Positive change comes in two ways, 1) showing white people that \"whiteness\" (that is, characteristics classically associated with white people) should neither be considered the \"norm\" nor the \"good\" that all other races are judged against 2) that shared experiences (or differences) should be identified by the actual viewpoints, actions, and lives of individual, rather than artificial racial identity groupings. Though most people view race as a giant dividing barrier between groups of people, scientists have shown that differences between racial groups are actually SMALLER than differences within each race itself.

   "JP: You might have noticed that I answered some of your objections to the beginning of my post at the end. For example:\n \nYou're arguing semantics. Giving one color preferrential treatment, such as extra points on an entrance exam, is equivalent to taking points away from another group when the ultimate objective is to take those with the highest point totals.\n \n I pointed out how this isn't necessarily the case in all cases of pref. treatment (though it is in AA) in my 1st point in the \"implications\" section. You also might want to remember that I'm opposed to AA (as the post made clear), so I'm confused about why you treated alot of it as if I was in favor of it.\n \n \nWhat subjegated races? Slavery ended 150 years ago. We don't have any subjegated races around here.\n [...]\n Maybe crack users are prosecuted more vehemently is due to the fact that they typically commit the bulk of urban crimes in order to pay for their addiction while powdered cocaine users are more likely affluent whites who aren't carjacking and gang banging. Which would you prosecute harder if you were the prosecuter with a limited staff of DAs? \n \n Crack isn't the only example I could offer of de facto racism subjugating a race. The point I was making was about mindsets, and the subconscious racist mindset is still prevelant in the US. To give another example, a study was ran by the University of Chicago where they sent out several sets of resumes to various corporations. The resumes were identical in terms of experience, qualifications, references etc., the only differences was that certain applicants were given \"black-sounding\" names (Tyrone, Aisha) while others were given \"white-sounding names\" (Corey, Caitlin). The white-sounding applicants had a 50% higher call-back rate than white people. That being said, with regards to crack cocaine vs. powder coke, you contradict all of your above arguments. You argue above that we shouldn't look to non-essential factors when making policy decisions (in this case, admitting people to college). Since race has no direct relation to merit, it shouldn't be considered. However, crack doesn't have any direct relation to crime either, aside from the fact that it is used by people who are more predisposed to crime (being poor). Hence, your logic, at best, would have us prosecute violent drug users who commit other crimes harsher than those who don't commit a crime while using (and which would lead to more harsh punishment of crack users). That's fine, but our drug laws don't work that way, instead assigning across the board harsher penalties to crack users compared to powder users regardless of the individual circumstances; this punishes non-violent crack users more severely than dangerous powder users. Robert Jensen, Professor at UT-Austin's School of Journalism articulates other examples of white privilege:\n \"[W]hen I seek admission to a university, apply for a job, or hunt for an apartment, I don't look threatening. Almost all of the people evaluating me for those things look like me--they are white. They see in me a reflection of themselves, and in a racist world that is an advantage. I smile. I am white. I am one of them. I am not dangerous. Even when I voice critical opinions, I am cut some slack. After all, I'm white...White privilege is not something I get to decide whether or not I want to keep. Every time I walk into a store at the same time as a black man and the security guard follows him and leaves me alone to shop, I am benefiting from white privilege.\"\n The important point behind Jensen's analysis is that white privilege is not something one choices for themselves as an overt racist. Rather, it is the consequence of deeply ingrained societal attitudes, and white people gain the benefits of it even if they disavow racism themselves (for example, Jensen points out how he still doesn't get followed by cops in stores). This isn't to say that white people need to live in some permenant state of guilt and repentence until our racial conceptions change. It is only meant to impress upon people the point the point that there are still battles left to be won, and that the race picture isn't as rosy as we'd all like to believe.",

   "So now the way you put it, whites compete against whites and blacks compete against blacks? That's how you make it sound when you say You were refused because your application wasn't as good as everyone else of your skin color\". You make some terrible comments. Preferential treatment is discrimination. The definition of discrimination is \"treatment or consideration based on class or category rather than individual merit\". Telling a black man he can have the finest booth in a restaurant because he's black is treating him different because he's black, not because of his merit. Look up the definition of discrimination before you apply it to your opinion of Affirmative Action. \n \n And you are right, you aren't refused because of your skin color. However, you are passed up because someone who is another color may be as good as you. When you allude to the bus situation, I don't quite agree with letting someone in line ahead of someone else because of race. Say a school admits 500 people. If you admit 50 blacks first, you have pretty much told 50 white people that they would have gotten in if it weren't for Affirmative Action, but they had to let 50 blacks in so they were passed up. Same as on a bus. What makes a black person so much better than a white person that he should be able to cut in line ahead of whites. Everyone today is complaining about EQUALITY. What you are proposing will totally defeat what we are trying to accomplish.\n\n \n My hand is broke so I'll use alot of conclusory statements.\n \n First off you assert that people were refused. They weren't refused. They weren't selected. Selection comittees are much different thsn those that are done by sheer numbers. So no one was refused. Selection is arbitrary butr influenced by many factors.\n \n Second is that legacy admission points still exist and that benefits whites because there are many alumni that atttended because minorities were denied.\n \n I'll post more later but it really tiring typing one handed.",

   " Believe it or not, I just read this entire thread from start to finish. Mana'ia, I'd like to address the big problem I have with your \"Preferential-good/Discrimination-bad\" argument.\n\n \n I do believe you. You were my biggest fan.\n \n \n\n I understand the difference in terms of the definition you give out (preferential being a positive deviation from the \"norm\", discrimination being a negative deviation from the \"norm\"). However, I find prefrential treatment to be dangerous because it gives a far more effective tool for whites to perpetuate race-based oppression than discriminatory treatment does.\n \n The reason for this is that most overtly discriminatory laws and de jure instances of discrimination have been eliminated from our legal code. Whites often argue that this has effectively made us \"color-blind\" and that race shouldn't be a relevant characteristic anymore. In our past debates on this subject, you have pointed out that race still plays an important role in society that overwhelming harms members of subjegated races.\n \n However, since this racism is no longer de jure, what is it? I would answer that it is a mindset (usually not explicit) that views \"white\" views, actions, etc as either superior or just plain normative. In keeping with this mindset, we effectively give preferential treatment to whites on a daily basis, by upgrading them and viewing their actions as more worthy of praise or advancement. For example, \"drugs are bad\" is a norm in our society. However, punishment for powder cocaine is far less severe than for many other drugs (for example, crack). Implicitly, this is b/c powder coke is used predominatly by the white middle class (or at least is viewed that way). So while the use of powder coke is a tragic case of misguided young person who needs treatment and rehab, crack is viewed, like other drugs, as a symptom of urban blight and the user as a future (if not already) hardened criminal who needs to be locked up. The primary disadvantage for minorities in the US today is preferential treatment for whites rather than discriminatory action against blacks; the powers that be tend to unconsciously feel more comfortable with people who seem to have shared their experiences and perspectives, so they look first to whites when doling out the rewards they possess.\n\n So how do we even the p[laying field and redress the problems caused by the unequal treatment? Do you think that minorities should just take it?\n \n \n\n What can we draw from this re: the \"preferential\" treatment that is AA? Several things:\n 1) pro-white \"preferential\" treatment is an imprecise analogy towards AA, but in a manner which actually makes AA worse in a way. AA manifests itself in a zero-sum game, that is, every additional spot given to the beneficiary is a spot taken away from someone else. Some pro-white pref treatment is also a zero sum game, but not all (for example, white bankers overlooking faults in white businessmen looking for a loan doesn't effectively preclude minority businessmen from getting there own loan, as generally there is more money available to loan then there are \"qualified\" lendees). This is NOT to suggest that white pref. treatment is better than AA. However, it does poke holes in the suggestion that AA is merely giving whites an \"explicit\" taste of their own medicine.\n\n The fact is qualfications for jobs are arbitrary. They use common factors but every college uses a commitee to select people. If it wasn't then computers or someone that could read could just select the highest scores and GPA.\n \n Race is used as a factor. they feel thst race helps bring in a new perspective that any other factors can't really compensate or compare. Universities give lots of consideration to students that have learned through extra curricular or other unsual experiences that would give them a different dimension of the applicant pool, company, or school.\n \n The use of Affirmative action is just another means of helping ( not guaranteeing) disadvantaged and diversifying America.\n \n \n\n 2) perpetuating pref. treatment (via AA) is dangerous to minorities b/c the logic behind it justifies equally pro-white pref. treatment which is the cause of most current race problems. As such, AA will end up having a net harmful effect on minorities even if it directly benefits them, the equivilent of 1 step forward, 3 steps back. I believe this is more dangerous than the more explicit \"discriminatory\" measures for several reasons. a) Since pref. treatment DOES provide a direct benefit to the disadvantaged group, it is easy to seduce minorities into buying into the ideology and thus blind them to the fact that the system it lies within is the root of the problem it purports to solve. b) Since the harms of pref. treatment to minorities are far less easy to see than those of discrimination, resistance is harder to muster amongst the oppressed and the oppressors can argue that there is no oppression at all. The non-explicit nature of pref. treatment harms makes it far more difficult to bring about the sort of collective guilt amongst the oppressors that makes change possible.\n\n So should we eliminate Americans with Disabilities Act, Medicare, subsidies, and social programs?\n \n If preferential treatment is really not successful shouldn't we eliminate them all?\n \n \n \n\n 3) Solvency comes in the form of rejecting race based narratives all together. Since race is fundamentally an artificial construct, and not something that is fixed or static, it can and should be seen as creation of certain classes to subjugate the other. The non-fixed quality of race should be quite clear, Irishmen and Jews both used to be regarded as members of other races (some people claim they still are), but now are normally considered \"white.\" Working within the racial structure (as AA does) is self-defeating b/c any explicit attempt to aid the oppressed race reinforces the false notion within the oppressive race that blacks, latinos, asians, jews (whomever) are part of an \"other,\" not like me, and thus are threatening. Positive change comes in two ways, 1) showing white people that \"whiteness\" (that is, characteristics classically associated with white people) should neither be considered the \"norm\" nor the \"good\" that all other races are judged against 2) that shared experiences (or differences) should be identified by the actual viewpoints, actions, and lives of individual, rather than artificial racial identity groupings. Though most people view race as a giant dividing barrier between groups of people, scientists have shown that differences between racial groups are actually SMALLER than differences within each race itself. It is only be rejecting the false narrative of racial differences that racial inequalities can be ultimately solved. \n\n Regardless of what race really is it is something thst is perceived in society and acted upon. It will be impossible to ask people to ignore race when it is such an obvious issue in many aspects of society.\n \n I'll post more when my hand is better.",

It prohibits discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion, or national origin (1) in employment by businesses with more than 15 employees; (2) by state and local governments and public educational institutions; and (3) in any program or activity receiving any federal funds. \n \n The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, amended in 1978, prohibits arbitrary age discrimination of persons aged 40 and older by employers of 20 or more persons. \n \n The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in employment, public services, public accommodations, telecommunications, and other activities \n \n \n http://www.abanet.org/publiced/lawday/schools/lessons/equality_background.html",

   "True that minoriktes are not a monolith. IT is also true thoguh taht you cannot truly understand those minorities without some type of representation. The more you have the more you will understand and gain a perspective from them. How can you tell waht it appealing or their mentality if you do not give them a voice within an organization. Growing up a certain race exposes the person to different experiences that shapes them much differently than us and tehrefore gives divcersity of knowledge and understanding. People can sympathize or sympathize but will never actually knwo waht it's like to be another race.\n \n iN YOUR PREVIOUS POST YOU DO MENTION IN EQUALITIES BASED UPON RACE YET YOU SAY THERE IS NO RATIONALE BASIS ( sorry didn't notice the caps lock). There is existent of racism today as it has existed forever and probaly will exist forever. Affirmative action didn't create it. It already existed and now poele use it to justify their racism.\n \n \n \n i agree there needs to be better edcuation about racism. Howver it sonds as if you're saying let's address racism so taht it doesn't exist one day but not address the problems it causes the victims. Racism and discrimination has always existed and probably always will and ot hope thayt we can undo the problem without remedying the effects is really unjust.\n\n \n Let's be clear: I think that more minorities in positions of power would be a GOOD thing. The question is whether AA, as a methodology for achieving said goal, is a good solution. I DONT believe that racism is immutable, I think it is a fixable problem (and if it isn't, we've got much bigger problems on our hands than AA).\n \n Even accepting your premise that we should aid the victims of past injustice (which I'm kinda shaky on, I see the argument for it but we really don't apply laws ex post facto), I think that if their is a binary choice between \"aid past victims\" and \"make sure their are no future victims\" I'd choice the latter. And since I think AA makes the latter scenario less likely, I think that's, to some degree, the choice we're faced with.\n \n Finally, you say you agree with the statement \"minorities aren't a monolith\" but then start talking about universal minority experiences that are unique to them as a group. That's a BAD mentality. It essentializes people, creates an \"authentic\" persona people are supposed to hold, and for those who don't identify themselves that way but are still part of the group it is supposed to describe, is alienating. Essentialization is the reason that you see many ghetto youth who are so enamored with rap and gang-styling, they aren't \"real\" if they don't act that way. More importantly, white essentialization is what created minorities essentialism, it has no independent persona. Whites said \"all people should behave 'normally'\" (normally of course, being an essentialized view of white culture). In order to maintain a seperate identity, minorities had to create a seperate series of norms that they then could point to and say \"this is who WE are.\" But the problem is that the dynamics that model creates are divisive, paradoxically, the unifying themes of essentialization actual require a focus on the differences between the groups. Furthermore, it forces people into catagories that are both too narrow and too broad: too broad because many people within a certain identified group are falsely included under a set of characteristics they don't share, too narrow because people who DO identify with the group but don't have the pre-req characteristics are wrongfully excluded.",

If a minority doesn't make good enough grades and doesn't test well enough then ostensibly he is not properly prepared for higher learning. If colleges want prepared students then it makes sense to test for that preparedness and nothing about the students race, sex, athletic ability or family history plays a role in that determination. \n \n The SAT as I understand it was created to eliminate bias in admissions.

   "First off it isn't a choice between ading the past and preventing the future. It's about aiding the past and current and stopping future. There is no future victims. If we were to go back into time and change the past injustices would there be more qualified minorities in the pool? Would that mean that there would be less spots for borderline students? So would thnose students have be given seats if the world had been fair? So are they really being denied something or are they really receiving someone else's seat?\n \n First off I said that there is universal experiences but that people can have different outlooks on those experiences. Also there are many perceptions that minorities have that are unique to us and that we all decide what way to act on them. It is degrading to anyone to have someone else that hasn't had those experiences to say they know exactly what we thing and how we think because they \"know\" our experiences. There is no way anyone either then ourselves can know of our experiences. Therefore the only way to address those and represent those is to have minority representation.\n \n Also certain issues are opnly devisive becaue people let them be divisive. Women and ADA preferences are devisive at times. Look how upset people are at the women golfers being in men's sports. Should we eliminate anything that is perceived as devisive?\n\n Ok, I'm feeling much better, and now I'll get back into the nittygritty. Before I do that though, for a good \"5th amendment = 14th amendment for the feds\" see Boiling v. Sharpe.\n \n OK, back to the regular deal. To the \"aid the past vs. aid the future\" arguments, you respond with a hypothetical situation that entirely misses all the analysis I give above. Yes, IF we could help people in the past with zero negative consequences, that would benefit us in the past, present and future. But that isn't the situation we're faced with. My analysis is all about that in this case, helping people in the past hurts people in the future, not that that is a general feature of all efforts to help people in the past. You're overgeneralizing and oversimplifying my position.\n \n Then to the essentialization points, you say that its degrading for people who haven't experienced something to say \"we know how you feel.\" That's fine, but you don't seem to realize that that applies just as much to \"I know how you feel, I'm a fellow human\" as \"I know how you feel, I'm a fellow black person.\" Both of them essentialize and construct similarities where they might not exist, and you do this yourself when you claim without warrent the presence of \"universal experiences.\" The claim of universality of experience is every bit as false when its based on race as when its based on humanity, and thus you contradict yourself in a single paragraph by simoltanously rejecting that outsiders can give opinions on what they haven't experience while at the same time selectively allowing certain people to speak for others on the grounds that they've \"shared\" an experience, when that isn't necessarily true.

The fact that any business meeting the criteria established can receive the benefit proves that it isn't AA for whites.\n\n \n In the world of commerce, SBA guaranteed loans are scored with what could be described as discrimination by one person and due rewards by another. The SBA is allocated X dollars for loan guarantee purposes. Any minority, woman or disabled person will score higher than an identical business owned by a person not fitting any or all of those requirements. There are government quotas as to percentages by those qualifications. This has spilled over into the corporate world where major companies now reserve a portion of their expenditures to be awarded under those guidelines, in reality increasing their operating costs to fill quotas with non-completive purchases. \n \n The process for qualification, government or industry, requires an individual familiar with financial documents and attention to detail to complete a somewhat complex, lengthy application. Once qualified, any astute business person is way ahead of domestic competition, especially so if they do business with the government. Over the years, scandals have always surfaced on a regular basis when non-minority companies use minority qualifications in the form of a qualified person fronting for the company. \n \n Sorry for the tangent. It is a situation, on the business side, that can not be solved with social engineering by government or industry.

   "Sorry for the post delay, I've been slumming it in the Politics forum.\n \n I misspelled the case above emoticon_emb. Its Bolling (not Boiling) v. Sharpe 347 US 497, the companion case to Brown v. Board of Education.\n Relevant Passage (though the opinion is like two pages long so you can read it yourself)\n \n\"We have this day held that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the states from maintaining racially segregated public schools. The legal problem in the District of Columbia is somewhat different, however. The Fifth Amendment, which is applicable in the District of Columbia, does not contain an equal protection clause as does the Fourteenth Amendment which applies only to the states. But the concepts of equal protection and due process, both stemming from our American ideal of fairness, are not mutually exclusive. The \"equal protection of the laws\" is a more explicit safeguard of prohibited unfairness than \"due process of law,\" and, therefore, we do not imply that the two are always interchangeable phrases. But, as this Court has recognized, discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process. \n \n Classifications based solely upon race must be scrutinized with particular care, since they are contrary to our traditions and hence constitutionally suspect. As long ago as 1896, this Court declared the principle \"that the Constitution of the United States, in its present form, forbids, so far as civil and political rights are concerned, discrimination by the General Government, or by the States, against any citizen because of his race.\" \"\n\n \n Since it essentially makes a racial classification that doesn't pass strict scrutiny a 5th amendment violation, it effectively applies the 14th amendment to the feds (albeit in a slightly diluted form).\n \n Back to the normal debate:\n \nMaybe I am over generalizing and over simplyfing or maybe your complicating it and individualizing the situation. Why is it that a people hurt collectively be restituted individually?\n \n Making the statement that the only future victims of affirmative action will be whites and nto taking into consideration taht there will be victims if there is no affirmtive action is conflicting. Minorites that are hurt currently by racial and cultural problems in this country are victims just as much as those \"victims\" of affirmtive action programs. That as I explained they can be seen not really as victims but beneficiaries of racial and cultural problems of the past and present. \n\n This mischaracterizes the victims I refer to. The victims are future BLACK people, not whites.\n Recall from my earlier posts\n \n 2) perpetuating pref. treatment (via AA) is dangerous to minorities b/c the logic behind it justifies equally pro-white pref. treatment which is the cause of most current race problems. As such, AA will end up having a net harmful effect on minorities even if it directly benefits them, the equivilent of 1 step forward, 3 steps back. I believe this is more dangerous than the more explicit \"discriminatory\" measures for several reasons. a) Since pref. treatment DOES provide a direct benefit to the disadvantaged group, it is easy to seduce minorities into buying into the ideology and thus blind them to the fact that the system it lies within is the root of the problem it purports to solve. b) Since the harms of pref. treatment to minorities are far less easy to see than those of discrimination, resistance is harder to muster amongst the oppressed and the oppressors can argue that there is no oppression at all. The non-explicit nature of pref. treatment harms makes it far more difficult to bring about the sort of collective guilt amongst the oppressors that makes change possible. \n\n and\n \nFinally, you say you agree with the statement \"minorities aren't a monolith\" but then start talking about universal minority experiences that are unique to them as a group. That's a BAD mentality. It essentializes people, creates an \"authentic\" persona people are supposed to hold, and for those who don't identify themselves that way but are still part of the group it is supposed to describe, is alienating. Essentialization is the reason that you see many ghetto youth who are so enamored with rap and gang-styling, they aren't \"real\" if they don't act that way. More importantly, white essentialization is what created minorities essentialism, it has no independent persona. Whites said \"all people should behave 'normally'\" (normally of course, being an essentialized view of white culture). In order to maintain a seperate identity, minorities had to create a seperate series of norms that they then could point to and say \"this is who WE are.\" But the problem is that the dynamics that model creates are divisive, paradoxically, the unifying themes of essentialization actual require a focus on the differences between the groups. Furthermore, it forces people into catagories that are both too narrow and too broad: too broad because many people within a certain identified group are falsely included under a set of characteristics they don't share, too narrow because people who DO identify with the group but don't have the pre-req characteristics are wrongfully excluded. \n\n These impacts all deal with harms TO BLACK PEOPLE via AA, not whites.\n \n You contest my essentialization points thus\n \nIf you really beleive what you are saying then do you think it is fair for a white person to be tried by an all black jury? What about a black man by an all Asian jury? Waht about a native american by an all white jury? Of course you don't think that is fair because they are not his peers and they ahve a background that woldn't help them to relate. Yes they can be explained everything that someone goes through but only someone that has been through similar situations can understand the nuances that come form living that way. So unless yout hink that it's fair to have an all white jury try a minoritiy then why do you think it fair to have any organization make decisions for minorties wihtout alowing some representation?\n\n First of all, I'd turn the question back on you: If I'm a black female, does having black men on my jury panel cut it for my \"peers\" requirement, or do I need black women? Would black men and white women be ok? What if I'm a black lesbian? How deep do you need to go before commonality can be assured?\n Second, the reason we allow race to be considered in terms of creating a balanced jury is twofold. First of all, since racism still exists, having racial balance on juries acts as a counterbalance to it. Dealing with present evils means we often have to make deals with the devil, but AA and education in general are properly viewed as a program for the FUTURE. The future which AA creates is one where racism exists in perpetuity because the mindsets which undergird it are not challenged but rather reified by the system. But in this light, the requirement of racially balanced juries should be seen as a necessary evil that is an outgrowth of past racism, not a shining example of our present success. Second, the potential damage to individual liberty that the criminal process represents means that we put limitations on it that we'd rather not have to do in an ideal world. Herbert Packer, Prof. of Law at Stanford Univesity writes \n\"The combination of stigma and loss of liberty that is embodied in the end result of the criminal process is viewed as being the heaviest deprivation that government can inflict on the individual. Furthermore, the processes that culminate in these highly afflective sanctions are seen as in thesmelves coercive, restricting, and demeaning. Power is always subject to abuse, sometimes subtle, other times...open and ugly. Precisely because of its potency in subjecting the individual to the coercive power of the state, the criminal process must...be subjected to controls that prevent it from operating with maximal efficiency.\" \n\n The immense damage that comes from both false convictions and even the APPEARANCE of impropriety in the system means that we need to eliminate perceptions of bias wherever we can. If that means having juries that appear to have fictive commonality with the defendant, so be it.\n \n The point is that AA hurts black people in the future by reinforcing the wrong mindsets, those of essentialization and the \"authentic\" black person.",

So there is no need to have a lesbian, felon, child abuser, conservative, atheist, etc to counter bias of behavior.\n \n So there must be a sense of commonality where inherent differences have subconscious or consious bias. Behavior though is what the law regulates and the jury is suppose to address.",
