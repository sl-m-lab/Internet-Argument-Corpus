   "On Darwin Sunday, I heard a presentation by an architect at my \n Unitarian church about evolution & intelligent design. I figured \n that if anyone knew about the true nature of intelligent design, it \n would be an architect. Curiously enough, he started out by \n mentioining examples of bad design, such as an uncomfortable chair. \n Even the best of architects & engineers come up with imperfect \n designs, just like the imperfect design of our vertebral column, \n prone to slipped discs and scoliosis trying to support the whole \n weight of our bodies in a vertical line. why is this? \n \n It's not that designers, in general, are stupid. It has more to do \n with the fact that virtually no one ever completely designs anything \n from scratch as a totally original creation complete in its mature \n form right off the bat. All human designs evolve from preceding \n designs in an incremental fashion, each new \"creation\" adding to the \n previous one (unless it's an Edsel). This under reported fact of \n human engineering puts the lie to ID arguments that rely heavily on \n examples of human design. \n \n Bill Gates did not \"create\" microsoft windows in its mature form all \n by himself without precursors. Ford Motor Company does not come up \n with each new model from scratch without refering to countless \n previous generations going all the way back to the Model-T. Design \n is always a collective project and it always EVOLVES! This is what \n is so absurd about the \"argument from design\", which itself has \n EVOLVED from Paley to Behe to Dembski, using human artifacts (such \n as the watch) which have evolved (from sundial to Timex) ... \n Evolution by Design ... \n \n By the same token, the \"designs\" we see in organisms have all the \n hallmarks of evolutionary precursors ... swim bladders to lungs ... \n spirochaete to flagellum ... Where is the intelligent agent in all \n this? In a way, it is all of us and all other organisms that ever \n lived, forming ecological relationships with eachother and \n coeveolving as a result of those relationships. That's where the \n real intelligence seems to be IMHO. The relationship between \n neurons in our brains, or microchips in a computer \n are all examples of designing intelligence. So, that is why \n you can't talk about design in the absence of evolution ... \n EVOLUTION BY DESIGN ...",

   "Walking-fish says:\n Well Beervolcano, as a Pastafarian you should know that the Flying Spaghetti Monster didn't always have those noodly appendages. You see, they evolved as well. They used to be these flat short little bits of pasta that would just fall off of the fork. It wasn't until they evolved into long winding tendrils that they could wrap around just about any utensil. Now of course they are so long that they can be used to explain near any wild idea with their tortuous flexible logic.",
