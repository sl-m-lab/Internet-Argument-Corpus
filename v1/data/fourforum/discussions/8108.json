Maybe the conservatives know this also and this why they are trying to impose their view into law that is hard to change.\n\n \n \nOne thousand Class of 2006 high school students from across the country were polled in November, 2005 on such issues as abortion, gay rights and gun control. While their opinions on abortion were much more conservative than one might think, their perspective on gay rights and same-sex marriage was totally refreshing. 53.6% supported same-sex marriage while 20.1% supported civil unions. Only 25.8% supported a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.\n I thought the bolded part was pretty interesting. \n \n Don't count on these people voting though.",
