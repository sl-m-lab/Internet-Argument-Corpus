   "German Jets in Southern Afghanistan. Ground Forces to follow them?\n \n \n Hello, strangers! My best regards from Germany! I want to start a debate over a changing situation in the Middle East. Firstly, I would like to give voice to my opinion and say that America is likely to change its immediate plans for Iran and will first strike the talibs who are concealing themselves in western Pakistan. \n \n First sign to this was given after Washington apparently cooled relations with Islamabad. US top ranking officials stated that the US would cut financial backing of Pakistani government as Pakistan is suspected of supporting the Taliban. Besides that, US and allied troops (British and Latvian troops among them) will be redeployed from Iraq to southern Afghanistan. \n \n I only regret that Chancellor Angela Merkel was too dough-face as she succumbed to persuasions of Washington and sent our Tornado jets to patrol in southern Afghanistan. In this respect I absolutely agree with the saying of German opposition Left Party leader Oskar Lafontaine. He said \"The administration is doing everything it can to get Germany directly involved in the war in Afghanistan. This path puts German soldiers' lives in danger and brings terrorism into the country\". I fear that after we showed a lack of determination we will have to move on and relocate our troops to southern Afghanistan as well and take part in a war against \"Pakistani\" talibs.",

   "Peoples Dying for... Food!\n \n Hello! Did any of you happen to think what's going to be the most horrid fate for the humankind? No, it is not global terrorism that stands the threat to most planet's population, but starvation! Yes, it's starvation! The population of the planet Earth is growing rapidly and we have reached the moment when we cannot produce enough food to subsist ourselves, especially after we began to use croplands to grow oil seed rape to process into bio fuel. So what's the solution of this difficulty? It looks like the US has arrived at a very nonroutine decision - wipe out certain nations from the surface of Earth. For example, the news got about not long ago that the US has engineered a deadly virus that selectively strikes the genome of people who belong to certain target population groups. Besides that, having proclaimed a crusade against terrorism, under this guise America is shelling countries of the so-called \"axis of evil\" - Iraq and Afghanistan (Iran is to follow) with DU weapons. FYI, DU stands for depleted uranium that causes growth of oncological diseases among children and results in infertility, which leads to slow depopulation in those countries. A dismal fact, isn't it? What is also grievous, the US has involved its European allies in executing its devilish plan...",

   "Food is just one of these guys' problems. Anyone who knows the history of this unfortunate 'country' knows that, and this is the most important thing to consider when anybody talks to you about Afghanistan, since pretty much the late 80s, Afghanistan has not been, and is not, a 'country' in what we in the west would term a 'nation state'. \n \n Such a situation is just meaningless over there; I've been doing a lot of research on this just for my own enlightenment. What first needs to be understood in the 'politics' of central asia.\n \n Since the original 'great game' of the 17&1800s, much of central Asia has been a game of Risk played by outside powers. The rise and fall of Soviet Russia in the region was just a mentionable C20th chapter in the ongoing saga of this vast region. \n \n What we have now is an area that extends from Iran in the west to China in the east, and Pakistan in the south to present-day Russia in the north. None of this area is even remotely under the auspices of a 'nation' as we know the term in the West. \n \n What you have are regional military powers based out of large cities, which include the wartorn remnants of national military infrastructure, combined with thousands of militias who control the townships, provinces, trade routes and transport hubs. None of these guys owe any allegiance to anyone, least of all each other. It's most reminiscent of the Roman Empire after it started to fragment, except there's never been an empire.\n \n In response to the OP; I genuinely doubt that the Afghans are resentful of our occupation in the same way that the Iraqis are; you know why? Because the vast majority of them don't even understand what the US is...all they know is their tribe, their land and their people. All they know the US as is a bogeyman 'from across the sea' who threatens them.\n \n This region of the world has seen nothing but violence and Islam for at least 30 years, more in most places. There has been no education, no guardianship of accumulated knowledge, no knowledge at all in fact that has been passed on from one generation to the next. With the exception of the very rich and the families who have inherited power, the people of these regions exist in much the same state in terms of global knowledge as all our ancestors did around a thousand years ago. \n \n The idea that we can effect any kind of change there is laughable. There are governments that our governments can strike deals with, and there are militaries that our militaries can parley with, but in terms of the general populace, the 'people' of Afghanistan don't even know what you mean when you say the country's name; they only know their family, their tribe, their locale and their cultural peculiarities. 'Unifying' or 'pacifying' the region means absolutely nothing to them because they have been fragmented beyond the comprehension of Western minds by their history.\n \n Interestingly, once this is absorbed as historical fact, the growth of Al-Qaeda is easy to understand, and equally its organisation (such as it is) and modus operandi equally so. \n \n I hate to bring science fiction into a real-world debate, but I believe the analogy is genuine, from what I have read over the years; We (the West) are a galaxy-spanning empire with well-defined borders and sociopolitical demarcations, attempting to subdue an unruly planet (the central Asian region) which is as diverse and as divided as our own. \n \n If anyone can tell me what they think 'victory' would actually look like for us in this corner of the world I would be happy to begin a hypothetical debate, but in terms of reality, we lost the fight centuries ago. We are an elephant stamping on a termite's nest, with all the analogies that that entails.",

Our economy IS failing, and it is a virtual mathematical certainty that our nation will fail, and in large part it is because of our military spending. We could cut EVERYTHING but military and SS spending and STILL run a deficit, and SS spending is not actually \"spending\", it is just repaying US treasury bonds. \n \n \n\n And finally, you are thinking exactly as any terrorist organization would want you to. They depend on people to be afraid of them, which is why they're called \"terrorists.\" The only reason we can't beat them is because our current government doesn't have the spine to do what it takes.\n\n \n First of all, we are not talking about a terrorist organization here. We are talking about the population of Afghanistan fighting against an invading nation. They are a resistance movement, and there is a HUGE difference between fighting a resistance movement and fighting terrorists. The biggest is that the aggressor (in this case the US) pretty much gets blamed for all the casualties by the local population, no matter who causes them, because if we were not there, the fighting would not be happening. The harder we are, the more the local population hates us and the more they support the opposition. \n \n This is not a new phenomenon. The earliest really well documented example is the French invasion of Spain. The French undertook a program of brutality against the Spanish population in an attempt to stop attacks on French troops by spanish irregulars (who the French general typically referred to as \"peasants with knives in the night\"). The more brutal the French became, the more the spanish people were pushed toward the resistance. \n \n The same thing happened in Iraq. The difference there is that we figured out we were not going to \"win\" so we started a pullback and turned the country over to people the Iraqi people could support....an anti US puppet government with Iran pulling the strings. We basically spent 3 trillion dollars and got NOTHING we wanted in Iraq. We just created another Islamic nation in the middle east. \n \n Do the same in Afghanistan. Declare victory and get the hell out. Our battle plan in Afghanistan was absolutely retarded from day one. Instead of sending in special forces troops to bring out the people we wanted there, we embarked on an infantry war against an enemy that has been killing off organized infantry for half a decade. It is like a hobby to them. After expending about 10x as much money, time, and resources as we should have, we actually DID reach a point where we could have had a victory (or at least significantly weakened the opposition) but instead of forcing the advantage, we pulled back and went and played in Iraq instead, which gave the afghans a chance to dig in and establish a proper resistance.",

   "Bombing holy cities wouldn't p1ss them off, it would teach them a lesson. During the Iranian hostage crisis, Ronald Reagan threatened to use nukes acts against Iranian religious fights, demonstrating that he wasn't afraid to kill Iranian civilians or upset the Iranian government. This was effective because terrorists typically use civilians and governments as shields. The terrorist factions let all the hostages go without a shot being fired or a bomb being dropped. They knew that \"Allah\" couldn't stop a nuclear weapon.\n\n Bombing \"holy cities\" would certainly teach them a lesson. It would teach them that the US supports and condones terrorism. We would essentially be telling them \"game on\". As for the rest of your \"thought\"...uhhhhh no. Like Daewoo said...a little something called arms for hostages. Please don't try to rewrite history, especially if you are going to do it badly.\n \n \nThe USSR faced 1,001 problems. They lost the arms race with the US, heavily depended on imports, had been losing faith in their government and its propaganda from day one, information regarding their failing economy was censored, etc. To say that terrorists were the reason for its collapse is ridiculous. The USSR dug their own grave.\n\n We heavily depend on imports, I have lost faith in my government, and our economy is failing as well. Not a good sign. Apparently, not many Americans are capable of learning from history. \n \n \nAnd finally, you are thinking exactly as any terrorist organization would want you to. They depend on people to be afraid of them, which is why they're called \"terrorists.\" The only reason we can't beat them is because our current government doesn't have the spine to do what it takes.\n\n It has nothing to do with fear, and everything to do with common sense and reality. We cannot win the fight in Afghanistan. That is a simple reality. It's just not conventional warfare...which is pretty much the only type of warfare the US has ever really excelled at. \n \n The only was to defeat terrorists is to take away their reasons to kill us. Have we tried that yet? Our government has plenty of \"spine\", but not enough brain. We have been at war for almost 10 years, and have not really accomplished much in the way of defeating terrorism. Perhaps it is time for a new approach?",

   "We are still in Afghanistan because Al-Quidea is still there.\n\n Al Qaeda is present and active all over the world. That is a lame excuse. \n \n \nWould you like to live in a country where suicide bombings occur everyday?\n\n I don't live there, therefore I really don't care. It's up to the citizens who do live there to rise up and fight for their country and their security. If they don't want to fight for it, then it is meaningless to give it to them. Besides, how many suicide bombings went on in Afghanistan and Iraq prior to our invasions of these nations? \n \n \nYou could say we are causing the suicide bombings, but another way to look at it is:\n If we don't fight them over in Afghanistan, they will fight us over here.\n\n That's the dumbest part of your post yet. You don't think they are still trying? Have you noticed all of the interrupted and near miss terrorist plots? They are financially bleeding us in Afghanistan and Iraq. Spending millions of dollars a day to kill one or 2 local Afghani kids carrying AK's is a collosal waste of money. Why not use that money where we can actually make a difference, here at home. Spend it on increased intelligence, increased screening of incoming cargo, better explosive detection, and better surevillance and protection of our borders. We might even have enough left over to help get rid of the budget deficit. \n \n We need to spend money wisely, not XXXX it away down the toilet known as Afghanistan.",
