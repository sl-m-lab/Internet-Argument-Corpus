   "Archie posted this post and I responded, but realized we were getting quite off topic.\n \n Here is Archie's post: \n\n That's because I realize that for everything one side posts on the internet, the other side will post something to refute it. And the left is famous for co-opting or refuting info which they don't want out there since it opposes what they represent.\n \n Regarding the genealogy, This explains my reasons very well, it isn't my refusal to admit I'm wrong, but my belief that I'm not wrong and that the world is older than 6,000 years old. I believe it may be as old as 25,000 years old. Not billions by any means, but not 6,000 either. According to Mat 1:17 So all the generations from Abraham to David [are] fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon [are] fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ [are] fourteen generations.\n \n Now to find from Adam to Abraham!\n \n there are 20 generations from Adam to Abraham. So that leaves 62 altogether form Adam to Jesus. If you read Matthew chapter 1, you will find that it list 14 generations between Abraham and David, 14 from David to the exile, and 14 more from the exile to Jesus. But-\n \n If you go back and look through the Old Testament itself, you will find that it \"skips\" some from the known generations talked about in Samuel and Kings. This is a very common practice all through the genealogies in scripture. Only the important people are mentioned. It may skip from father to grandson, great grandson, or further.\n \n So when you begin to count the generations between Adam and Abraham (which are listed in Genesis chapters 4, 10 and 11) it is impossible to know if or how many generations may have been \"skipped\".\n \n So there is no reliable way to count the generations, nor to come to a 6000 year old earth (which is based on no generations being \"skipped\"). It was these skipped generations which causes question marks to exist regarding the overall age of the world in my opinion. No denials here, just refusal to accept the party line of a 6000 year old Earth. How many generations are there from Adam to Jesus? - Yahoo! Answers\n\n And a quick response by me (I may get into more detail later)\n \n Just a comment on your post here - Yes, it is impossible to know if some generations (a father or a son or a grandson) were not listed - those do not affect the actual TIMELINE set up by the genealogy when we are told how old a person is IN RELATION TO another person (told when a person is born in relation to the age of another). I could give you a genealogy saying I was born when Bob (who is my grandfather but not a piece of information I list) was 60. Then Walter was born when I was 65 (which in the genealogy I do not say is my grandson). \n \n The two missing people (my father and my son) do not make any difference on the overall timeline - 125 years has still passed between the birth of Bob and the birth of Walter. 60 years has still passed between the birth of Bob and my birth, and 65 years has still passed between my own birth and the birth of Walter. The two missing do not matter whatsoever to the actual timeline (time that has passed).\n \n But then, we are getting OT, so why don't we start a new thread on Religion forum or E/C forum?",

The question becomes how long was a generation in reality? And what numbers have theologians used in coming to the 6000 year age since Creation. \n \n They rightly add up the ages of the Patriarchs from Adam to Jesus but we know that there are uncounted members of the genealogical record between those referred to. It is those gaps which account for years not considered in the math which I question. And remember, I'm not making any absolute declarations here. I'm just saying that I have questions which can never be answered satisfactorily based on what we know since those gaps exist and can't accurately be filled in. \n \n Let me give you just one important example which by itself could explain hundreds of years being forgotten or not accounted for and another example which could account for adding thousands of years since an actual creation date. \n \n First, the genealogical record starts with Seth as the first descendant from Adam. Scripturally this is the relevant ancestor based on the bloodline, but what about Cain and Abel? Adam and Eves first sons? How many hundreds of years prior to Seth's birth were they born? We don't know at all. But to imply that they don't change the outcome is very wrong indeed.\n \n Also, how long were Adam and Eve living in the Pre-Fallen Garden before having been tempted by satan? It could have been 20,000 years. Or what if they had children in the garden before Seth, such as Abel and Cain who traveled the Earth and built the pre-flood civilizations which science can date to these periods but can't otherwise explain? Because according to evolution, this was still the stone age period of history. \n \n If any of these possibilities were true, there is much that We don't know and never will in this incarnation. We know that Adam named all of the animals on Earth, how long did that take? Did he travel the Earth to where the animals lived to do that, or were they represented in the garden? We just don't know the answer to that question. We know that God walked with them in the cool of the day before the Fall, it mentions no children at that time, so does that mean that none existed? \n \n It only mentions that Adam and Eve were expelled from the garden after the fall, but is that the full story of the reality which existed? We can make assumptions which we have done, we can guess/theorize which we have done. But to make an absolute claim that the age of the Earth from Creation till today is 6000 years I think requires hubris since we know that questions such as these and generational gaps which we can't answer do exist. \n \n We must not assume that what is listed in the genealogies represents all of the available information which a dating timeline can be derived from. The unknown gaps are important problems regarding the actual age from creation to Jesus and were never given by God for the purpose of dating the age of creation. So using them for this purpose is likened to cosmologists attempting to date the Universe based on theoretical observations which are unprovable and unrepeatable under laboratory conditions which you well know that I have also opposed in numerous debates here with rational argument that they can never satisfactorily answer.\n \n I am only being consistent in not reading more into the available evidence than we ought to just because it's the accepted party line for many theologians. I needn't question or reject any aspect of what the bible does say by not making inferences regarding the actual age of Creation based on what it doesn't say. That is my argument and I'm sticking to it. :)\n \n I would invite Easyrider and any other believers who have studied the genealogies to comment on whether they accept my questions as valid, or not. The bottom line is though, that I don't see anything to debate here since all I'm saying is that we shouldn't assume to know the age of the Earth from Creation based on the genealogies in the bible which is the prime evidence used to make that determination.",

The question becomes how long was a generation in reality?

Made up example \"Ham begat Gruel whn his days numbered 100 years. Gruel beget Hambone when hs days numbered 100 years\". That means 200 years passed between Ham's brth and Hambone's birth. Even if the begetting was done indirectly (through Ham's son Steak who then had Gruel), it DOES NOT MATTER if Steak is left out.\n \n \nIt is those gaps which account for years not considered in the math which I question.

Some amount of time less 130 years. \n \n \nIt could have been 20,000 years.\n No, it couldn't. Adam only lived to the age of 930 (not 20,000). Since he had Seth at age 130, they had to have been in there for some amount of time shorter than 130 years.\n \n \n\n Or what if they had children in the garden before Seth, such as Abel and Cain who traveled the Earth and built the pre-flood civilizations which science can date to these periods but can't otherwise explain? Because according to evolution, this was still the stone age period of history. \n What if they did? It would NOT MATTER ONE WHIT. It doesn't matter if my dad had one kid before me of a hundred million before me - he was still 29 when I was born. The amount of children born does not change a timeline like this.\n \n We could do a similar timeline with, say, the Presidents of the US.\n \n Wahington was 3 years old when John Adams was born. Adams was 8 years old when Thomas Jefferson was born. And so on. \n \n Now, let's zoom all the way ahead to John Tyler. George Washington was 58 years old when John Tyler was born. It doesn't matter that any of those other people were born at any time in between - all that matters to a timeline is to have Washington's age when Tyler was born, and Tyler's age when, say, Lincoln or someone like that, was born.\n \n As long as you have a continuous movement of age when someone was born and then age of that second person when the third was born, it doesn't matter if they are related or unrelated, it doesn't matter if the first pirson had thirty kids before the second in the list was born - IT DOES NOT MATTER.\n \n \n\n If any of these possibilities were true, there is much that We don't know and never will in this incarnation. We know that Adam named all of the animals on Earth, how long did that take? Did he travel the Earth to where the animals lived to do that, or were they represented in the garden?

But I expect nothing more from you and smiley than childish quips and backhanded insults. \n\n I thought the insults were of the forward variety: You can't do simple math.\n \n \nHopefully other believers who actually grasp the issue will comment on my problems with the party line beliefs and respond so I can get some relevant feed back which will make this thread worthy of participating in.\n\n Hopefully other \"believers\" are able to grasp simple addition",
