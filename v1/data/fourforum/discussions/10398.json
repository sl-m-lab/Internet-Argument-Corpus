There is little doubt of this, and it is so by design. The Electoral College, by which we choose our President, is one example. The appointment of judges is another. And the selection of Senators not by the people but by the state legislatures, is yet another. The Senatorial selection system eventually became fraught with problems, with consecutive state legislatures sending different Senators to Congress, forcing the Senate to work out who was the qualified candidate, or with the selection system being corrupted by bribery and corruption. In several states, the selection of Senators was left up to the people in referenda, where the legislature approved the people's choice and sent him or her to the Senate. Articles written by early 20th-century muckrakers also provided grist for the popular-election mill.\n \n The 17th Amendment did away with all the ambiguity with a simple premise - the Senators would be chosen by the people, just as Representatives are. Of course, since the candidates now had to cater to hundreds of thousands, or millions, of people instead of just a few hundred, other issues, such as campaign finances, were introduced. The 17th is not a panacea, but it brings government closer to the people. The Amendment was passed by Congress on May 13, 1912, and was ratified on April 8, 1913 (330 days).\n",

It is important to realize that this issue is not great to look at when so many courts have ruled differently. They are bound by the courts above them which can easily cause a different ruling and perhaps one they may not agree with.\n\n \n Well, the point is that many courts have seen the question the same way gay activists do, as an equal rights issue where laws that selectively disadvantage gay Americans should be subject to strict scrutiny, given the history of discrimination and persecution of gay human beings as a group.\n \n Some courts have not made the obvious choice, but they are wrong.\n \n \nI actually don't support a federal constitutional ban on gay marriage...i think the issue is best left to the states. If the high court ruled that banning gay marriage was unconstitutional then I'd say I would support an amendment that simply stated the issue is left to the states.\n\n \n Well, I'm not going to get involved in a side argument about federalism. Three points. First, it's convenient for married Americans if all states have essentially similar laws on marriage. That is no trivial matter. \n \n Second, we have an issue with the Constitution's Article 4, Section 1:Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state. And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof.Now, it is true that the Supreme Court has allowed considerable latitude here for states to claim public interest exemptions to this clause, and that is reasonable because no state wants to be held hostage to the legislative idiocies of some other state. But gay marriage is not an idiotic piece of legislation, and it is reasonable for gay married couples to have their marital contract respected over the entire country, not just in the states where they contracted it.\n \n Third, while states do have a right to regulate marriage as they see fit, they do not have a right, given the 14th Amendment, to selectively exclude gays from the protection of their laws. Let them regulate marriage if they want, but let's not let them discriminate unjustly against their gay citizens, which is what many of them do today.\n \n \nThey based it mainly on the due process clause and none of them joined the equal protection argument. I'm not sure how that doesn't rule it out as the argument certainly was brought up and only embraced by one judge (who later said it wouldn't apply to marriage). Given the inconsistent nature of the court though I suppose you are right in that it really doesn't rule it out. \n\n \n Right. Lawrence was not decided on an equal rights basis. Instead, all sodomy laws were declared unconstitutional, even the ones that applied equally to gays and straights. This was a major victory for everyone's rights, including the rights of straight Americans whose private sexual behaviour was often criminalised by the states they lived in.\n \n It is interesting, however, that O'Connor saw fit to make an equal rights case to strike down those laws that selectively singled out gay Americans. That is not going to be forgotten in future arguments before the court about laws that in effect, also single out gay Americans (because straight Americans will not be interested in same-sex marriage).\n \n \nI found the lack of direct precedent and the failed use of original meaning in the Romer case. The example given in the dissent really drove home the point that if you are going to say it fails the rational basis test then you need to state why it did fail and actually contradicted itself by no overruling Bowers at the same time.

The opinion never really answered this although it turned out later they really did want to overturn Bowers and they did so successfully which ironically goes against the philosophy that many of them hold where \"liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt\".\n\n \n Well, Lawrence very definitely said that Bowers was a wrong decision, and they were right about that. Romer is in the same tradition of protecting individual liberties against irrational state persecution as Lawrence, and merely underlines how wrong Bowers was. Now, may be opinions aren't written perfectly and with hindsight their reasoning could be improved.\n \n Bowers was an aberration of state power over individual liberty. Lawrence and Romer, however, are in the tradition of American jurisprudence.\n \n \nI'm not sure I have to say Loving v. Virginia is wrong in the decision but I would say they were wrong in their last paragraph or so of reasoning. I think it is clear the equal protection clause meant absolutely no race based laws (which is why affirmative action should be unconstitutional). But lets assume original meaning meant Loving was incorrectly decided. So what? You simply change the law and allow it. I seriously doubt Virginia would have had that law for much longer as people were convinced interracial marriage was ok and the laws changed. This is what gave women the right to vote for example.\n\n \n Well, Alabama only repealed its anti-miscegenation law in the late 1990s, some 30 years after Loving. It wasn't constitutionally valid after Loving, of course, but it took that long to get it off the books. If Loving wasn't wrong, whatever the errors in reasoning you perceive, then court decisions against laws banning gay marriage aren't wrong, either. Being gay and being black should be pretty much the same thing under the law.\n \n \nTo say a decision is wrong is not to say you don't like the outcome and visa versa.

Only if you think the government has a right to persecute and enforce a narrow morality that abrogates the rights of citizens. I think future gay rights arguments will focus more closely on Romer than on Lawrence. Privacy is a valuable right, but equal protections where equal treatment is called for are just as important.",

Lawrence and Romer, however, are in the tradition of American jurisprudence.\ntradition? Doubtful...the living constitution has only been 50yrs and the current standard even less. It used to be that \"liberty\" (under a living constitution) was reserved for those rights fundamental to our beginning society. This restriction was recently removed and now has a strict test for the \"fundamental\" rights and a rational basis test for everything else. Of course Lawrence had to use the rational basis test and claimed it failed it somehow. It failed because apparently \"a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice\". Of course the dissent correctly points out that if this is the case then why are morals allowed as a state interest for \"fornication, bigamy, adultery, adult incest, bestiality, and obscenity\". This was obviously not answered and is still a question I ask often on these forums because every law against some of those things comes down to a moral judgment.\n \n \nWell, Alabama only repealed its anti-miscegenation law in the late 1990s, some 30 years after Loving.\n Only as a gesture...It wasn't like the Alabama legislatures were for no interracial marriages until 1990. \n \n \nIt wasn't constitutionally valid after Loving, of course, but it took that long to get it off the books.

Let's suppose you are right. What, then, is wrong with interpreting the Constitution in a way that preserves the liberty of the individual against the encroachment of authoritarian and moralistic government?\n \n \nMarriage is consistently been one that the states are allowed to deny and have done so many times...in fact back to the days when polygamy was legal is some states.\n\n \n It's certainly true that state marriage laws vary somewhat. But I completely deny the state's right to make laws that selectively discriminate against gay citizens, when there is no legitimate public interest in doing so (other than satisfying Bronze Age religious prejudices). The state has the brute force to make such discriminatory laws because it outguns those they make laws against, but it does not have the right, or the constitutional authority.\n \n \nYou know I don't support a 14th amendment that doesn't follow the original meaning but if you argue that it evolved to mean this then I'd have to say how can you tell without the Supreme Court ruling on it? Furthermore if they said the 14th amendment didn't evolve to that then how could say they are wrong?\n\n \n The Supreme Court already made an equal rights ruling on gay rights in Romer. The 14th Amendment doesn't evolve, but our understanding of what it means to be human does. It now includes the right to self-determination of sexual orientation, and the formation of same-sex partnerships (aka marriages). We shouldn't try to live according to 18th century notions. That would be silly, and the founders anticipated that such evolution would occur, if not the direction.\n \n \nI thought the law was terrible but certainly was not a victory as it was done illegitimately.\n\n \n I have to wonder whether any court decision would be \"legitimate\" in your eyes. Maybe we should have a national referendum on everything, since whatever the majority wants is right, in your view. That's the sort of democracy the Constitution was written to prevent.\n \n \nBut she specifically stated this [O'Connor's equal rights argument in Lawrence] doesn't apply to marriage. I find it rather inconsistent on her part because if you believe the 14th amendment means what she means then the only logical conclusion is that gay marriage would be covered.\n\n \n Well, I agree she's wrong about that -- if the state can't legislate against gay sodomy only, then I don't see how the state can legislate against gay marriage only. I think the equal rights argument applies equally to marriage, because gay partnerships are fully equal, functionally, to straight partnerships, and it is discriminatory not to treat them that way.\n \n \ntradition? Doubtful...the living constitution has only been 50yrs and the current standard even less. It used to be that \"liberty\" (under a living constitution) was reserved for those rights fundamental to our beginning society. This restriction was recently removed and now has a strict test for the \"fundamental\" rights and a rational basis test for everything else. Of course Lawrence had to use the rational basis test and claimed it failed it somehow. It failed because apparently \"a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice\". Of course the dissent correctly points out that if this is the case then why are morals allowed as a state interest for \"fornication, bigamy, adultery, adult incest, bestiality, and obscenity\". This was obviously not answered and is still a question I ask often on these forums because every law against some of those things comes down to a moral judgment.\n\n \n The United States is only about 230 years old (compare the British monarchy and parliamentary system at about a 1000 years). Fifty years is a respectable chunk of that time. And our moral perceptions evolve, too. The Constitution provides a framework for how we legislate, not what we legislate. If we decide that gay Americans are human beings who have full human rights, then the Constitution already protects them. Courts are simply enforcing that.\n \n \nIt doesn't matter to me what means people try to fight it as they are not fighting it by legitimate means.\n\n \n Sorry, but in the US system, courts are a legitimate venue for the address of grievances. \n \n \nAn argument the gay marriage is a right that originally was in the 14th amendment (or whatever) is a much better stance to me (although wrong) than to say the 14th amendment now should mean gay marriage bans are wrong.\n\n \n Of course the drafters of the 14th Amendment didn't have gay marriage in mind. They had equal protections in mind. With our 21st century understanding of sexual orientation and the equality of gay human beings, the 14th Amendment applies to us as well. The founders would probably not have agreed, but we live in our society, not theirs. If the Constitution is interpreted as forcing us to live according to 18th century moral standards, we may as well give up the Constitution as a bad job, and I don't think it was a bad job. It was a remarkably prescient and useful document -- it did not set down moral precepts for society. It allowed those to evolve.",

If you agree please present a standard of interpretation.

The 14th Amendment doesn't evolve, but our understanding of what it means to be human does.\nThe only way an understanding can change without changing the meaning is if the understanding was wrong at first because it did not represent the meaning. Romer ruled based on an evolved meaning or changed meaning. It certainly didn't follow precedent, traditional understanding, or the original meaning of the 14th amendment.\n \n \nWe shouldn't try to live according to 18th century notions. That would be silly, and the founders anticipated that such evolution would occur, if not the direction.\nActually they argued against having judges changed meaning (see federalist papers) but they did want the constitution to change with the times and more over wanted the laws to change with the times. This is the very reason you don't see much in the constitution. It is much harder to change so therefore if you leave it up to the general law making body then it is free flowing with society changes. If you have a judge make a ruling it is now rigid and hard to change even if society wants to change. Nevertheless, you can change the constitution which is the proper means to \"evolve\" a constitution.\n \n \nI have to wonder whether any court decision would be \"legitimate\" in your eyes.

In other words you can only claim meaning of something when you have evidence to support that meaning. We have evidence that supports no race based distinctions which is why the court came up with a strict test for race...pretty much nothing passes. \n \n In any event this is irrelevant because the law is not applied unequally.

No, Steve, they are the same rights you already have, but prefer to deny to gay Americans.\nActually it was about preferred treatment.

The law in Colorado was designed to say the state (and local governments) couldn't pass laws adding homosexuals to those kinds of preferred laws.

People who don't drive aren't obligated to follow the laws... because they can't. The laws don't apply to them, until they start driving.\n \n This is not like anti-gay marriage laws, which only apply to gay people as straight people don't drive gay marriage.

   "The irony here, of course, is that it is not the democratic process laid out in the constitution that is mostly taken by the gay rights movement, but rather the non-democratic aspects. It has been the judiciary that has been almost exclusively embraced in this effort, and in a rather imbalanced way. So if the constitution is getting more democratic, then I find it odd those seeking to enact change here are often taking the most non-democratic strategy possible under the constitution: change via judicial fiat.\n\n \n Refusing to allow the majority to trample on our rights is not \"non-democratic.\" It's making use of the provisions in the U.S. constitution and in state constitutions that protect minorities against unchecked majority rule, against the tyranny of the majority. \n \n The use of the judiciary is not \"non-democratic.\" The judiciary has a role in checking the other branches of government when those branches enact laws contrary to the constitution. The myth that court rulings are contrary to democracy is simply spin used by anti-gay activists and extremist right-wingers, who are perfectly happy to use the judiciary when the rulings go in their favor (e.g. the ruling in Bush v. Gore).

Prof, this is disingenuous. When evaluating a statute under the 14th Amendment's EP clause, race is in a category of its own. I'm sure you know this as you seem quite versed in Constitutional history.\n \n \nIn each of these cases, the states sought to uphold a fictional equality.

Gay people are not the same as heterosexuals when it comes to whom we choose to marry, and to require gay people to adhere to a heterosexual standard for marriage is not equality.\n\n The Constitutional provision in question does not guarantee equal treatment (a substantive term). It guarantees equal protection (a procedural term). If the law is being applied to everyone the same way; if everyone must follow the same rules, then the law is being equally applied. That is the very essence of equal protection.\n \n \nWhat should be the standard for equality in marriage laws? People must be free to marry the person of their choice, unless there is a compelling state interest in NOT allowing a particular kind of marriage. I use the standard of compelling state interest here because marriage IS a fundamental right, and laws restricting marriage should be subject to strict scrutiny, in my opinion. There is no compelling state interest in preventing same-sex marriage. There is only anti-gay prejudice and people's religious convictions. Neither of these is a legitimate reason to prevent two people who love each other from marrying.\n\n You think that courts ought to treat sexual orientation with strict scrutiny analysis? That would be nothing more than usurping the proper authority of the judiciary. No court has attempted that, except for the recent Iowa District court. But I wouldn't take that decision seriously; it's author didn't seem to think strict scrutiny should be applied, and his strict scrutiny analysis (in the very least) will be reversed (probably quite harshly) by the Iowa Supreme Court.\n \n And you think marriage is a fundamental right. Fair enough. But you would be hard pressed to find in our history or tradition that same-sex marriage is a fundamental right. As good of a Prof as you might be, you won't find that anywhere in our history, tradition, or legal precedents. Trying to generalize the issue to a discussion of \"marriage being a fundamental right\" would require that you were able to demonstrate historically that marriage meant nothing more than \"two people who love each other.\" An overview of our history will not bear that out. In fact, you'll find that loving each other is not a requirement, but being of the opposite sex is. The fundamental right argument is sophistry at best; one must change the obvious and fair meaning of the terms for it to work. I think pursuing that angle is flat dishonest.",

   "It's the reasoning courts have historically used to determine whether the government is legislating legitimately, or haughtily abrogating the rights of the people, or some of the people, out of bias or spite. Religious zealots are usually keen to abrogate the rights of people to do what they think shouldn't be done, and the Constitution was written to protect us against them.

   "I completely agree with you here. Phyllis is being deliberately disingenuous, I suspect because it suits her religious bias against gay Americans which she doesn't want to admit. These folk all remind me of Union U's \"Bob Maddox\" on the CNN boards!\n\n You do not know whether I have a religious bias or not. In fact, you don't know what I think about religion. You couldn't even begin to guess. You have no facts on that issue. The only 2 facts you have is that I think human rights come from God and that gay marriage is not required by the Constitution. That's a pretty orthodox view and is far from demonstrating a bias of any sort. But that's ok. Lack of evidence never seems to hamper your willingness to form broad, sweeping, and usually negative conclusions. In reality, you would have to have incredible superhuman powers to be able to draw any definitive conclusions from the two unrelated facts above. I did not think that you believed in the supernatural, but perhaps I was mistaken.\n \n I am not being deliberately disingenuous; and I'll refrain from saying that you are being deliberately irrational.\n \n \n\"Y'all have the same right to marry a person of the opposite sex that I do... what are y'all complainin' about?\" The insincerity and bogosity just drip off remarks of that kind.\n\n Now you are trying to imply that I am insincere? I assure you that you are wrong, just as you are with virtually every opinion you have offered on these forums. I am, in fact, very sincere. Every law discriminates, and you apparently agreed with me. After all, it was you who said:This is pathetic. You are telling me that all laws set up two groups of people: those who obey them and those who break them. Duh!You are all over the place. You go from agreeing with me about a statement to calling me insincere for making that statement. You really should make up your topsy-turvy mind. You seem to have a knack for being intellectually upside down. I suggest you work on that.\n \n Whether a law discriminates is not an important question. Whether it discriminates in violation of the Constitution is. That is the point. You apparently cannot process such subtle, but yet very important distinctions. You prefer to resort to name-calling, conjecture, and baseless \"facts.\" You refuse to read judicial decisions, but nevertheless declare that certain decisions are correct or incorrect based on nothing more than what policy you happen to like (gay marriage: good; no gay marriage: bad). Then you \"debate\" with people who actually have read the opinions up for discussion and who have actually studied this subject very closely. You offer your opinion, usually in less than a couple of sentences, most of which are nothing but name-calling. Some people forgive that ridiculousness and choose to refute your opinion with actual evidence (why we bother I cannot fathom). You support judges who make rulings based on what they think is \"reasonable,\" unless those judges do not agree with you as to what is \"reasonable\" or not. You decline to take this issue up in the debate forum where your arguments will actually be judged, and when people call you on it, you simply reply with more name-calling and the declaration that you have already \"demolished\" their argument. In all honesty, if you are demolishing anything, it would have to be your credibility.\n \n Now, you seem to think I have a religious bias against gay Americans. You have no evidence to suggest that, yet you accuse anyway. Well, it seems that you have a religious bias against religious Americans. They have just as much a right to enact their policy preferences as you do. You can blame the refusal to allow gay marriage on religious bias. Doing so is easy, and does not demand that you actually make rational and consistent arguments. But have you ever considered that the reason you can't convince people to change their views on gay marriage is because you are wrong? Sure, it's easy to allude to \"tyranny of the majority,\" but have you ever stopped to think that the real reason you have been unable to change people's mind on this issue is because you are wrong? I have nothing to say as to the general questions surrounding gay marriage, but one thing I know is that the Constitution does not require that it be recognized. But since you cannot muster enough force in your argument to persuade the public that you are right, you go ahead and cling to the hope that the judges will force society by fiat to do what you could not persuade them to do through legitimate process.",

You can fudge by refusing to reply explicitly addressing that, or you can state for the record how your beliefs are different from the average Christian anti-gay believer.\n \n \nI am not being deliberately disingenuous; and I'll refrain from saying that you are being deliberately irrational.\n\n \n If you weren't disingenuous, you wouldn't post nonsense to the effect that gay equal rights aren't being restricted by anti-same sex marriage laws.

I don't think you dissemble there at all.\n \n \nEvery law discriminates, and you apparently agreed with me.\n\n \n Odd. I went to a lot of effort to demonstrate that NOT every law discriminates with the traffic law example. The existence of two classes of people who either obey or disobey law X is not discriminatory in itself, it's an arbitrary situation called into existence solely by the passage of law X. \n \n Now laws against same sex marriage assuredly discriminate against gay people -- this is the reason they exist, in order to discriminate against gay citizens, for no rational purpose that you or your buddies here have ever managed to support.\n \n In any case, the discrimination of anti-same sex marriage laws is not the same as your trivial example of obedience vs. disobedience, because there is no way usually of disobeying such a law, except in the highly unusual and contrived case when a mayor or clerk decides to ignore it and issues a marriage license despite it. Usually such licenses are not issued at all, and it is impossible to break such a law. Compare that with anti-sodomy laws, which are indeed simple to break.\n \n So the discrimination here is solely against gay people because they are gay. \n \n \nWhether a law discriminates is not an important question. Whether it discriminates in violation of the Constitution is.\n\n \n The laws you eagerly defend are irrationally discriminatory against gay people, and since gays as a historically discriminated against group arguably fit the criteria for strict scrutiny (even if some judges prefer to ignore that for now), this is a good part of the constitutional case against them. \n \n Even religious right-wingers appear to agree with this assessment, because they soon saw where the judicial and legislative winds were blowing, and started a sleazy and mendacious campaign to pass an anti-gay marriage constitutional amendment to make them constitutional. They've passed many such state amendments. If they felt secure that anti-gay laws were constitutional, why go to all that effort? Was it just part of the usual religious fundraising campaign where they demonise gay people in order to frighten the flock into giving?\n \n The rest of your post is just an extended and whiny personal attack that needs no answer from me, as it tells us much more about you, Phyllis. You keep avoiding the central point of the anti-gay purpose and effect of such legislation, and hammering on irrelevant side issues such as my style or whether discriminatory laws specifically mention the groups they are intended to disadvantage -- which of course they don't, but it would take someone blind or deliberately disingenuous to claim that if a law is cleverly drafted to avoid mentioning a group by name, it doesn't discriminate against it unfairly and unconstitutionally.

   "And we have the 24th Amendment. This example proves rather than dismisses my overall point.\n \n And besides, you should know better. Comparing race based distinctions to non-race based distinctions does not fly when interpreting the 14th Amendment. As a history Prof, you should know that better than anyone on this board.\n \n \n Shame on you. Comparing race-based classifications to non-race based classifications. You know that current marriage classifications do not discriminate based on race.\n \n \n Shame, shame, shame. Prof, this is disingenuous. When evaluating a statute under the 14th Amendment's EP clause, race is in a category of its own. I'm sure you know this as you seem quite versed in Constitutional history.\n \n \n The fact remains: no one is denied a marriage license because they are gay.\n \n \n The Constitutional provision in question does not guarantee equal treatment (a substantive term). It guarantees equal protection (a procedural term). If the law is being applied to everyone the same way; if everyone must follow the same rules, then the law is being equally applied. That is the very essence of equal protection.\n \n \n You think that courts ought to treat sexual orientation with strict scrutiny analysis? That would be nothing more than usurping the proper authority of the judiciary. No court has attempted that, except for the recent Iowa District court. But I wouldn't take that decision seriously; it's author didn't seem to think strict scrutiny should be applied, and his strict scrutiny analysis (in the very least) will be reversed (probably quite harshly) by the Iowa Supreme Court.\n \n And you think marriage is a fundamental right. Fair enough. But you would be hard pressed to find in our history or tradition that same-sex marriage is a fundamental right. As good of a Prof as you might be, you won't find that anywhere in our history, tradition, or legal precedents. Trying to generalize the issue to a discussion of \"marriage being a fundamental right\" would require that you were able to demonstrate historically that marriage meant nothing more than \"two people who love each other.\" An overview of our history will not bear that out. In fact, you'll find that loving each other is not a requirement, but being of the opposite sex is. The fundamental right argument is sophistry at best; one must change the obvious and fair meaning of the terms for it to work. I think pursuing that angle is flat dishonest.\n\n \n You absolutely CAN compare race-based distinctions to non-race-based distinctions, and the Supreme Court does this all the time. Race does not stand in a category all its own, as you contend. Remember that the Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny not just to laws that discriminate on the basis of race, but also to laws that discriminate on the basis of religion and national origin, and to laws that deny a fundamental right. Since the Supreme Court itself has declared marriage to be a fundamental right, they ought to apply strict scrutiny to any laws that deny people the right to marry the person of their choice. \n \n The issue here is not whether there is a right to \"gay marriage.\" The issue is whether there is a fundamental right to marriage, specifically a right to marry the person of one's choice. Can states restrict this right? Yes, they can, but in my view they should have to show a compelling state interest in enacting a law that denies people the right to marry the person of their choice. That's the strict scrutiny standard. At the very least, states must show a rational basis for denying people the right to marry the person of their choice, and anti-gay prejudice is NOT a rational basis. Neither is one's religious conviction, as people cannot impose their religious beliefs on others through law.\n \n I am not arguing in this post for the application of a strict scrutiny standard for cases involving discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. I am arguing for the application of a strict scrutiny standard for cases involving the denial of a fundamental right, which is the standard that the Supreme Court has adopted in such cases. And the Supreme Court itself has called marriage a fundamental right.",

Indeed its entirely moot on marriage as such.\n\n I never said that the Constitution requires the recognition of marriage. In fact, I have previously said that the Constitution does not require the recognition of any marriage. See, for example, this post. Before you go around making accusations, perhaps it would be beneficial to ensure that such accusations are actually true.\n \n \nAn unjust law can discriminate outside the explicit context of the consitituion and still be invalid. For example the constitution is moot entirely with regard to the issue of separate but equal schools. That law discriminated and its not clearly unconstitutional. It treated all people equally under the law did it not? Everybody had to obey the same set of rules. Whites were required to use the white schools and blacks the black schools. A place for everything and everything in its place. As you may recall the US supreme court held such arrangements to be unconstitutional even though they are not explicitly covered.\n\n This is because race is treated very differently under the law.

   "You absolutely CAN compare race-based distinctions to non-race-based distinctions, and the Supreme Court does this all the time. Race does not stand in a category all its own, as you contend. Remember that the Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny not just to laws that discriminate on the basis of race, but also to laws that discriminate on the basis of religion and national origin, and to laws that deny a fundamental right. Since the Supreme Court itself has declared marriage to be a fundamental right, they ought to apply strict scrutiny to any laws that deny people the right to marry the person of their choice.\n\n Well, for one thing, the Supreme Court got a little out of hand with substantive rights. However, even assuming that the Supreme Court's recognition of substantive rights is legitimate, they have never declared that same-sex marriage is a fundamental right. They did say that marriage was a fundamental right, but assumed within that declaration is the marriage of opposite-sex couples. Again, if you want to use the fundamental right standard, you're going to have to demonstrate that our historical definition and understanding of the marriage relationship was merely the union of two individuals. That is not our history.\n \n \nThe issue here is not whether there is a right to \"gay marriage.\" The issue is whether there is a fundamental right to marriage, specifically a right to marry the person of one's choice. Can states restrict this right? Yes, they can, but in my view they should have to show a compelling state interest in enacting a law that denies people the right to marry the person of their choice. That's the strict scrutiny standard. At the very least, states must show a rational basis for denying people the right to marry the person of their choice, and anti-gay prejudice is NOT a rational basis. Neither is one's religious conviction, as people cannot impose their religious beliefs on others through law.\n\n The courts are not buying this argument because it would be dishonest to do so.\n \n \nI am not arguing in this post for the application of a strict scrutiny standard for cases involving discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. I am arguing for the application of a strict scrutiny standard for cases involving the denial of a fundamental right, which is the standard that the Supreme Court has adopted in such cases. And the Supreme Court itself has called marriage a fundamental right.\n\n Yes, the Supreme Court has called marriage a fundamental right using substantive due process. However, there is no indication that what they meant by the word marriage was simply the union of two individuals. No, it meant the union of two individuals of the opposite sex.

Most gay people do not agree with you about this, and many heterosexuals don't either. Indeed, according to the most recent poll by Gallup, roughly 30% of Americans support the right of same-sex couples to marry, which means that some 30% of Americans disagree with you that marriage means only a the union of two individuals of the opposite sex. That's certainly not a consensus. It's a significant and a growing minority. \n \n Should your \"definition\" of marriage be imposed on everyone else, including people who don't agree with your definition? Or should marriage to the person of one's choice be considered a right, subject to restriction only when states have a rational basis, a public interest reason for restricting the right to marry? \n \n People who support individual freedom will argue that marriage to the person of one's choice should be considered a right, and that there is no rational basis or public interest reason for a state to deny to someone the right to marry the person of his or her choice who happens to be of the same sex. You want to define such a marriage as something different, as \"gay marriage\" rather than simply as marriage. But the gender of the marriage partner does not, and should not, place the marriage into a different legal category. It's marriage. \n \n You have yet to put forward a rational basis, the lowest level of scrutiny, for states to deny someone the right to marry the person of his or her choice who happens to be of the same sex.

First cousin marriages are currently allowed in 26 states, but not in all states.

There really are people in polygamous relationships who want the right to marry more than one spouse, and there really are cousins in relationships who want to marry each other. \n \n The legalization of same-sex marriage will not and should not automatically make all other \"unconventional unions\" legal.

To change the standard to include a requirement for rational justification would create inconsistences as even gay people would not countenance the relationships you are suggesting when those relationships are perfectly justifiable under the very same reasoning. I think \"incest pride\" would draw little to no support from even gay people who cannot seem to understand why their sex life is not acceptable to other people.\n \n To continue denying them until they are addressed on their own strikes me as doing an extreme disservice to those groups who may not have the strong political presence that gay people have accumulated. \n \n \nA number of people have objected to our repeated reference to the issue of inter-racial marriage, saying that we cannot equate race with sexual orientation.

   "The arguments employed by gay proponents would apply verbatim to both cases, however. The prohibition of polygamy was mostly, if not purely, religious persecution (my grandfather was a product of a polygamous marriage... the history of this is quite shocking). The only rational argument against adult incestuous relationships that I can see would be the risk of illness in any children, but many arguments gay marriage proponents employ disregard children as a consideration (saying that marriage doesn't require children, not that children are unimportant to gay people).\n \n To say that other unconventional relationships exist in a vacuum from each other is not correct. \"Marriage\" between a man and a woman exists almost dogmatically; it does not require justification. To change the standard to include a requirement for rational justification would create inconsistences as even gay people would not countenance the relationships you are suggesting when those relationships are perfectly justifiable under the very same reasoning. I think \"incest pride\" would draw little to no support from even gay people who cannot seem to understand why their sex life is not acceptable to other people.\n \n To continue denying them until they are addressed on their own strikes me as doing an extreme disservice to those groups who may not have the strong political presence that gay people have accumulated. \n \n Your careful distinction between \"drawing parallels\" and denying \"equivalence\" is somewhat ambiguous. Where do you draw the line?\n\n \n You seem to be arguing that gay people should take up the cause of polygamy and the cause of cousin marriage at the same time that we struggle for same-sex marriage. Why don't you do that? If you want to work on those issues, then do it. But don't insist that gay people do this work instead of you.\n \n I am glad to support polygamists and proponents of cousin marriages in their struggles, but questions about these and other types of marriage have to be considered independently of each other and independently of same-sex marriage. The rationale of the states in banning different kinds of marriages is not identical. States have banned different forms of marriage for different reasons. States have banned marriages between adults and children for different reasons than they have banned polygamy. In the former case, the states do appear to have a rational basis for banning this type of marriage. In the latter case, states probably do not have a rational basis. \n \n In dealing with the laws banning inter-racial marriage, the Supreme Court did not lump inter-racial marriage together with every type of marriage form and consider all of them together. The Court had to deal with the Virginia law that banned inter-racial marriage specifically. There are certainly parallels that we can draw between the rationale for banning inter-racial marriage and the rationale for banning same-sex marriage. But while there are clearly parallels, they are not identical circumstances. Courts need to scrutinize a state's rationale for each particular kind of ban, not lump them all together and assume they are all identical.",

You are projecting your beliefs about what marriage means onto the Supreme Court ruling. \n \n The Court was silent in its ruling about the \"meaning\" of marriage, probably because it was not at issue in the case. What was at issue was whether, and under what circumstances, a state could restrict the right to marry on the basis of race. You are right that the Court did not comment in that case on whether a state can restrict the right to marry on the basis of gender or on any other basis. They focused specifically on the issue in the case, which was restriction of marriage by race. \n \n But the fact that the Supreme Court declared marriage to be a fundamental right is important, because it suggests that the Court, to be consistent with its own rulings, should apply a strict scrutiny test to cases involving limitations on the right to marry. I don't know that they will, but the test developed over time by the Court has been to apply strict scrutiny in cases involving laws that discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, and cases involving the denial of a fundamental right. If marriage is a fundamental right, then that's significant, and it does not rest on a \"definition\" of marriage that you seek to impose on previous Court rulings. Because the majority did not say, \"marriage according to this definition is a fundamental right.\" They simply said marriage. \n \n At the time, DOMA did not exist as a federal law or as various state laws, and there was no common legal \"definition\" of marriage restricting marriage by gender. You may argue that the restriction of marriage by gender was simply assumed, and so there was no need for such a legal \"defintion\" in the states or on the federal level. But today, because of changing social circumstances and people's beliefs, gender restrictions on marriage cannot simply be assumed. Remember that more than 30% of Americans say they support the right to same-sex marriage, which is far more than supported inter-racial marriages in 1967. There is a sizeable minority in support of same-sex marriage, and that number has grown over time. There is no broad consensus today that the \"meaning\" of marriage restricts it to a man and a woman. The commonly accepted \"meaning\" that you write about no longer exists, because of the struggles by us gay people for equal treatment under the law and full inclusion in the society.",

   "I've argued pretty much the same thing you are arguing as well. Gay marriage is not really marriage equality. It just extends it to one more group. \n \n I think differences here come down to the fact that people see the issue differently. Those arguing for gay marriage see the issue AS 'gay marriage.' But for those who don't think the line should be moved outward, they see this issue as marriage, period. The issue is marriage, not just gay marriage. It's whether marriage is going to be viewed as an institution that we fundamentally change depending on who or what comes along wanting access.\n\n \n This is an interesting post, and I did not have time to address it adequately back when you posted it. I think the issue here IS marriage, not \"gay marriage.\" It's whether and under what circumstances a person should be restricted from marrying the person of his or her choice. So I think you are right that the issue is marriage itself, and under what circumstances the right to marry one's chosen spouse can and should be denied by the state.\n \n I have argued, and I continue to argue, that the burden should be on the state to justify disallowing people to marry; the burden should not be on individuals who seek to marry to justify their union. There should be a presumption of individual liberty, not a presumption of state power to deny individual liberty. Gay marriage is fundamentally no different from heterosexual marriage; both are marriage. The only difference between same-sex marriage and opposite-sex marriage is the sex (some use the term gender) of the spouses involved. Legalizing same-sex marriage does not fundamentally change the nature of marriage. In contrast, creating a separate category of civil unions DOES change the nature of marriage in that it creates a two-tier system of unions. (The same is true of the creation of covenant marriages in the few states that have created such marriages as a separate legal category. Only a tiny percentage of couples have chosen covenant marriages, and I suspect this legal category will disappear out of disinterest and lack of use.) \n \n When a state seeks to deny certain couples the right to marry, and the state's denial is challenged in court, the state needs to make its case for prohibiting that type of marriage specifically. Each specific type of prohibition or restriction has to be considered independent of all the others, so that courts and the public can hear the rationale for that specific prohibition. \n \n Gay people are not the first group of people to challenge marriage restrictions in court. We almost certainly will not be the last group. Marriage has not been an inflexible and unchanging institution; indeed, marriage has changed considerably through the course of history. Changes in an institution like marriage should never be made lightly or without careful consideration. But when a state restriction against certain people marrying has no basis other than prejudice against the people seeking to marry or some people's religious beliefs, then it's time for the restriction to be swept away. People's fundamental rights and liberties should never be compromised purely to suit the prejudices or to conform to the religious beliefs of the majority.",

They want to keep our relationships illegal, which they cannot do any longer since the Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas.

   "My \"sexual attraction\" is not an \"anomaly.\" Indeed, my being gay is not a sexual attraction. It's part of who I am.\n\n \n Well... yes it is an anomaly. That does not make it inherently good or bad, any more than heterosexual attraction is good or bad. Heterosexual attraction, however, is the norm and certainly serves as the means of species procreation in nature (among those that sexually reproduce). In terms of evolution heterosexual attraction serves a purpose while homosexual attraction does not. Or, at least, it serves a much different one.\n \n This does not inherently mean anything in regards to the disposition of rights. It may, however, affect how people view homosexual relationships. Acquiring a mate and having children is a natural urge many people (and perhaps, I daresay, most) experience and respect. The fact that a heterosexual coupling can produce offspring is certainly a special thing. Homosexual couplings cannot naturally do this. The desire to delineate between the two types of couplings in what you call them is understandable, to my mind. \n \n \nWould you call your love for your spouse merely a \"sexual attraction?\" I don't think so. Gay people love no less deeply, and form no less committed family bonds, than heterosexuals do.\n\n \n I am not a very religious person. I don't consider love as God reaching down with His divine fingers and pointing out my future partner.

Certainly I do not suggest that gay people do not genuinely love their partners.

There is something about the male form, in general, that you find attractive. It may not be consciously quantifiable, but there are some characteristics that men have that triggers your brain to be attracted to them. In the same way, men that are attracted to women find something attractive about the female form. This form can even be exaggerated to the point that it cannot exist in nature and will be found very attractive by men. There are certain metrics, apparently, that our brain looks for in a mate that can be bamboozeled by either accident or design. The 'wrong' gender is similar enough in appearance that I would wager even a relatively small disturbance in that mate-finding function would produce homosexual attraction.\n \n I'm reminded of a quote by Steven Pinker:\n \nZoologists have found that males of many species will court a wide range of objects having a vague resemblance to the female: other males, females of the wrong species, females of the right species that have been stuffed and nailed to a board, parts of stuffed females such as a head suspended in midair, even parts of stuffed females with important features missing like the eyes and the mouth.

You may regard compromising the rights of other people as \"satisfactory,\" but as one of the people's whose rights you would be so willing to compromise, I don't find that satisfactory at all. \n \n Being put into a separate category is inequality. It's not just inequality in name; it's inequality in fact. The civil unions and domestic partnerships that now exist are not equal to marriage. If all marriages were renamed \"civil unions,\" including same-sex marriages, then fine....I have no quarrel with that. But I won't accept, as a permanent arrangement, having our marriages put into a separate category just so people can continue to regard us as second-class citizens. \"Separate but equal\" is inherently unequal. \n \n And I disagree with you that the will of the majority is a good reason to continue discrimination against a minority. If that were true, we would still have segregation laws in the South, and we would still have laws banning inter-racial marriage. Popular prejudice and animus against a particular group do not constitute a rational basis for a discriminatory law. The Supreme Court majority said this in the case of Romer v. Evans, which was case involving state abrogation of the rights of gay people. \n \n Finally, I do not think the reason for the continuing hatred of gay people and the resistance to gay equality is rooted in gay pride marches. Prejudice against gay people is much more deeply rooted than that. You appear to be blaming gay people for anti-gay prejudice. That's wrong, my friend. Gay people did not cause the hatred and discrimination that we have long faced. Blaming the victim is just letting the haters off the hook. They'll use any excuse to try to justify their attitudes, including denouncing us for having marches.",

   "This is not about one shared characteristic. The arguments used by many if not most gay proponents would apply verbatim in advocating other unconventional matches. It would be short-sighted and frankly stupid to ignore this fact. If the arguments and rhetoric is genuine then there is little if any basis to discriminate against those other matches.\n\n \n Well, that is not true, the same arguments do not apply to gay unions as would apply to polygamy. Polygamy is illegal. Gay relationships and marriage are not. Unlike gays, polygamists have not become accepted members of the mainstream community with many of the same rights for their relationships, families and the way gays live out essential human sexual identity.\n \n Those are some reasons. Frankly it's really stupid to create this false dilemma. Polygamous marriages are religious and straight marriages. There are many similar arguments in regards to religious beliefs being the foundation of the union. Therefore, with this flawed logic, if I support religious marriages, or religious rights and freedoms, I must support polygamy.\n \n Many of the same arguments can be used to support polygamy as support straight couple marriages as well. Supporting the right of two straight people to be married, means one must support the right of several straight people to be married to on another, using this faulty logic. Both have the argument that they are straight, choice, they love one another, they are both traditional, etc.",

   "You might as well argue for the legitimation of rape, as that produces children.\n\n \n Why? I was not arguing for either marriage or rape but was instead pointing out that heterosexual attraction serves a purpose that homosexual attraction does not. \"Heterosexual attraction\" does not equal marriage and neither does it equal rape.\n \n The children any homosexual couple adopts is a result of heterosexual attraction, in the vast majority of cases.\n \n \nThis \"marriage is only for breeding\" is just a canard, brought about solely because gay sex doesn't beget children, and that is the only distinction you guys have ever managed to find between gay and straight relationships, which is why you now inflate it into an all-consuming importance it never actually had.\n\n \n It is not all-consuming, but it certainly is a fact. Shall you also argue that the only difference between a conventional marriage and the union of an adult and child 'is only a difference in ages'? Differences are differences. You do yourself no service by trivializing the differences or ignoring what these differences mean to people.\n \n \nIf you were arguing for the abolition of marriage between all straight couples who weren't in the act of raising their biological kids, I'd take your opinion as a serious one, but as it is, it's only a red herring.\n\n \n You confuse for forest for the trees. Whether any particular couple can or does produce children is irrelevent. Heterosexual coupling does produce children.\n \n \nNo, they don't. My position in favour of equal marriage rights for gays doesn't mean I have to support polygamy. Let the polygamists make their own arguments.\n\n \n They don't need to. If you believe your own arguments then you've made the argument for them, whether you've realized it or not. That you do not support polygamy only exposes your own hypocrisy.\n \n \nIf you do not understand the nature of a straight relationship, how can you expect me to explain the nature of a gay one? One might as well try to explain colour to the blind or music to the deaf.\n\n \n So are you saying that I deliberately blind myself to the nature or do I simply not understand the nature of gay relationships? You're wobbling a bit.\n \n \nThey certainly do if they are extreme enough. Check your local laws.\n\n \n Hm, you're remarkably vague when pressed for more detail.

   "Unless you plan on marrying yourself, it must apply to more than one individual. You are not asking for the right to enter into a heterosexual relationship. This is a right you are entitled to. You are, instead, trying to apply a freedom that is fundamental to heterosexual couples to gay couples as well. This is not something you are entitled to, it is something you are fighting for. \n\n \n The right to marry the person of one's choice belongs to individuals. The right to marry belongs to ALL individuals, not just to heterosexual individuals. It IS a right that we are entitled to, just as you are. We have to fight for the acknowledgement of this right because of historic injustice, just as people had to fight for women's right to vote and for the right of individuals to marry a person of a different race. The denial of these rights was an injustice that people fought to correct.\n \n I have acknowledged, on numerous occasions, that the states can restrict rights if they have a good reason for doing do, either a compelling state interest or at least a rational basis. In the case of state abrogation of fundamental rights, the states must show a compelling state interest, according to Supreme Court precedent. \n \n Popular prejudice against gay people is not a compelling state interest or even a rational basis.

   "Bad behavior such as sarcasm when others are trying to help your cause but don't do it like you want it done. The all or nothing attitude. Bad behavior like proclaiming how different you are and then getting flaming mad (pun intended) when you're treated differently. You lose sympathy when you behave badly.\n \n\n \n I fail to see how your posts are helping our cause. But if you say that this is your motive, then I'll believe you have positive intentions. \n \n Who has been \"proclaiming how different\" they are and then getting mad about being treated differently? I don't know whom you are describing here. Most gay people do not go around proclaiming difference; we just try to live our lives. \n \n The other point I will make to you is that it's been the struggle for full equality that has produced steps toward equality, like civil unions. But civil unions are NOT equality. They are separate and unequal. They are not just different in name; they are unequal in fact, in concrete fact. California has \"domestic partnerships,\" and they do not grant rights and protections equal to those of marriage. They provide some rights and protections, but they are not equality.\n \n When it comes to human rights, of course we are going to keeping fighting for full equality. That's not all or nothing; most of us are happy to accept steps toward equality. But they are steps along the way, not the end. \n \n I think that is where you and I disagree at root. You regard civil unions for gay people as an end we should accept. I regard civil unions as a step along the way to full equality. We still have a long road to travel, and there will no doubt be setbacks along the way. I doubt we will win fully equal marriage rights thoughout the nation in my lifetime. But then, I didn't think when I was younger that we would win the right to marry anywhere in my lifetime, and we did! Life is full of surprises. \n \n One thing I can assure you: we did not win the right to marry in Massachusetts by asking for civil unions. We did not win civil unions in Vermont by asking for civil unions. Those victories came as a result of gay people's struggle for full marriage rights. We won civil unions in some states because we fought for full marriage rights. And we are not going to stop at winning civil unions.",

They are not equality, and we will not stop or settle for civil unions as a separate and unequal category. But they are an important gain, no doubt. \n \n Sigma wants to tell us that we are demanding too much, that people hate us because we refuse to compromise. Hell, yeah, we refuse to compromise!

You impose one restriction (number of), I impose another.\n\n \n Which brings us back to the rational reason for discrimination against gay couples in marriage law. What is it, besides the whim of religious bigots? At least I can mount a rational argument against polygamy that isn't prejudicial against anyone. One may or may not accept the argument, but it isn't the result of bigotry against polygamists.\n \n \nIf the argument is equality it is. You can't argue against one restrictions using equality without arguing against all restrictions. If you believe in logic and reason how can you say otherwise?\n\n \n Well, I've pointed you to the arithmetic, and if you can't count beyond two, it's not my fault. A marriage made of two is not the same as a marriage made of three or three hundred. As long as it's the same for everyone, and no-one's innate orientation towards polygamy is ignored, then what's the big deal in opposing polygamy?\n \n If, on the other hand, you can show me there is an innate sexual orientation towards polygamy, then you might persuade me there is an equal rights argument. However, my feeling is that polygamy is just a cultural habit, not an innate aspect of human nature.\n \n Now, Ohioprof makes this argument:\n You/we can and should argue against any restrictions for which a state does not have a compelling state interest, or at the very least, a rational basis. I do not think there is either a rational basis or a compelling state interest in banning polygamy. If there is one, the states need to make their cases for such a ban.\n\n Now, while I think the state has a compelling interest in banning polygamy, and I'm certainly happy to state the arguments in favour of that interest, it is at least a valid argument that the state shouldn't govern unnecessarily. Give people the freedom they need, the line here goes. Well, fine -- I disagree with Ohioprof on this one, but my arguments against polygamy could be wrong, and I'm willing to be persuaded that they are.\n \n But the arguments for polygamy can't be based on the notion of equal protections under the law, because polygamy isn't a discrete sexual orientation. It's not innate like skin colour or orientation. It's a purely cultural trait, more like religion.\n \n However, I think you need to recall that the US Supreme Court doesn't recognise all religious practices as equal and protected, either. To go back to Ohioprof's point, discrimination against a group or group practice needs a compelling reason to justify it. Bigotry is not a compelling reason.",

Unlike polygamy, which the Bible doesn't take a clear stand on either way (which is not the same as saying it condones it). And keep in mind that forbiddence of an action and punishment over an action are two very different things. Don't mistake my belief that the NT should be taken into account for the idea that the OT should be ignored. It's the punishments of the OT we were discussing, not the rules themselves that would have (before Christ) required punishment. However, none of this changes the fact that if you are going to apply arguments such as your take on the 14th amendment to marriage, you can't stop at just gay marriage. The issue then becomes marriage, period (in whatever form), not just gay marriage. You can't say it has to be argued on it's own merits--a more specific issue--yet then argue about the broader issue of marriage by invoking the 14th. If you're going to argue that marriage falls under the 14th amendment, then the issue becomes marriage, and about whether it needs to be broadened at all, no matter who comes along wanting access to the word.

Surely it can't be that difficult for you, since you insist it's only a choice.\nI believe I have stated it is genetic and social...just like many scientists have stated.\n \n \nApparently it isn't enough for you to take the word of anyone gay that they have no control over their sexual orientation, neither are you prepared to accept the conclusions of scientists who have studied sexual orientation and consider it to be innate and not under voluntary control.\nHuman behavior is rarely, if ever, genetic.",

   "However, none of this changes the fact that if you are going to apply arguments such as your take on the 14th amendment to marriage, you can't stop at just gay marriage. The issue then becomes marriage, period (in whatever form), not just gay marriage. You can't say it has to be argued on it's own merits--a more specific issue--yet then argue about the broader issue of marriage by invoking the 14th. If you're going to argue that marriage falls under the 14th amendment, then the issue becomes marriage, and about whether it needs to be broadened at all, no matter who comes along wanting access to the word. Though really, that's what the issue has always been about. I believe this is what Steeeeve has been trying to get you to understand.\n\n \n You obviously have not been reading my posts carefully. I have always said that the issue is marriage, and I have always argued that the right to marry the person of one's choice is a fundamental right that belongs to all people. All people should have access not just to the word marriage but to the whole institution of marriage. I have never argued that the right to marry should be extended to gay people but not to others.\n \n The issue here is not whether the right to marry should be broadened. The issue is for what reasons the right to marry can be restricted. We are not talking about changing marriage; we are talking about whether and under what circumstances the states can deny someone the right to marry the person of his or her choice. \n \n I have not argued, and neither has Leszek, that states cannot or should not be able to restrict the right to marry. The question is on what basis the states should be able to restrict a person from marrying the spouse of his or her choice. My argument is that states must show a compelling state interest in restricting someone from marrying the person of his or her choice. States cannot and should not be able to bar marriages between two people simply because of prejudice against those people or because of some people's religious beliefs. \n \n When I say that each type of restriction must be considered individually and separately from all the others, I am observing a legal and historical reality. States have various different reasons for restricting marriages. For example, states restrict marriages between adults and children for a different reason than they restrict marriages between people of the same sex. In considering 14th amendment challenges to state laws restricting marriage, courts are going to look at specific cases, not at all kinds of marriages together. When the Supreme Court considered the Virginia law banning marriage between people of different races, they did not then rule on restrictions on cousin marriages or on polygamous marriages. They considered the state's rationale for restricting inter-racial marriages, and they found that the rationale did not suffice to make that particular state restriction on marriage constitutional. Courts must and will consider challenges to different marriage restrictions separately from each other. \n \n A court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage will not automatically eliminate all state restrictions on marriage, because each restriction must be considered on its merits. Massachusetts still bans marriages between adults and children, for example. The state supreme court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage did not eliminate all restrictions on marriage, just the one the court was then considering. If someone wants to challenge age restrictions on marriage, they will have to bring a lawsuit on that specific issue and make their arguments that the state does not have a compelling interest in banning adult-child marriages. I think it's clear that the state does have a compelling interest in banning such marriages, and I think anyone challenging such a ban is likely to lose, and should lose, their case.",

My bible says you are a sinner (but I'll conveniently pass over all the other passages that say I'm a sinner).\" That's about the crux of it. Many are here to insult and preach, not debate. IMO. \n \n I really am not into all this hair-splitting over US constitutional law. The world is much bigger than the USA. Relationships and families with same-sex status are being created all over the world. It's already a reality and will never go away. It's that simple. It's the humane thing to grant homosexuals 100% equal rights. Anything less is unacceptable.\n \n Gays are getting married already in this world and the sky has not fallen... unless you think global warming is because of 'dem 'darned gays...

   "I'm not. Again, you're the one taking a position here: that the Bible somehow sanctions or condones polygamy (based on the idea that it doesn't explicitly condemn it, of all things!).\n\n \n Well, it is at least permitted or condoned. If it were not condoned, it would be forbidden.\n \n \nHuh?? emoticon_confused No, I condemn both.\n\n \n Sorry, I meant that although you condemned polygamy, which is not condemned in the bible, you did not sanction execution of homosexual men, which is unequivocally commanded by the bible because the bible does, explicitly, condemn homosexual behaviour. (I'm not one of those who cares to (re)interpret the bible in ways favorable to reason and human decency -- I take the bible at its word, the way biblical fundamentalists do. This allows me to condemn the bible! :) )\n \n \nNo, you know as well as I do that those are by far the exception, and are the fringe fundamentalists of the religion. Seriously now.\n\n \n I am being serious. I don't think they are merely an unimportant fringe, I think they are a politically powerful force. Now most Christians will, like you, draw the line at executing gay people, but far, far fewer get too perturbed by other Christians who take their bible more literally and act violently against gays. A common response is to equivocate, and say that gays bring the violence on themselves by \"flaunting\" themselves, rather than get to grips with the fact that their religion expressly commands such violence. Of course, Christian fundamentalists aren't alone -- they are joined by Orthodox Jewish and Islamic fundies, as well.\n \n \nI certainly am not pretending it's irrelevant. Rather there are parts that are clearly irrelevant now, and punishing gay people is one of them. That's pretty mainstream, IMO and from my experience with Christians.\n\n \n This leaves a huge question hanging. Even IF the bible can be legitimately reinterpreted as meaning that gays should not be put to death, then why can't it be reinterpreted as meaning that a committed gay partnership is acceptable to god -- especially as Christ didn't have a solitary word to say about homosexuals at all. This smacks of cafeteria Christianity -- you accept the bits of the OT that suit you and reject those that don't.\n \n \nI have no problem with that. There is enough in the New Testament to view gay relationships as going against what God wants people to do, without ever cracking into the Old.\n\n \n Only some ravings from St. Paul who was clearly unhinged, and HE was relying on the OT condemnation, as he offered nothing new about it -- except to bring in lesbians, poor souls, whom the OT had mercifully overlooked. And again, Christ didn't think it worth mentioning for some reason, so it can't be the huge sin many Christian leaders like to pretend it is, even if one does subscribe to cafeteria Christianity.\n \n \nUnlike polygamy, which the Bible doesn't take a clear stand on either way (which is not the same as saying it condones it).\n\n \n Sorry, but the writers of the bible were so keen to condemn everything they disapproved of, they would hardly have accidentally omitted polygamy if they found it abhorrent. They didn't, because it was an integral part of their culture. End of story. \n \n \nHowever, none of this changes the fact that if you are going to apply arguments such as your take on the 14th amendment to marriage, you can't stop at just gay marriage.

I believe this is what Steeeeve has been trying to get you to understand.\n\n \n I certainly can stop at gay marriage, unless someone can persuade me that some other factor pertaining to marriage is a vital component of an individual's nature. Sexual orientation certainly is, though this was not properly appreciated until relatively recently. But now we do appreciate it, we need to read the 14th Amendment in the light of our improved understanding of human nature.\n \n Steve has the wrong end of the stick, as polygamy is not the equivalent of monogamy.",

Age restrictions are rational and compelling, but only when it comes to an adult seeking to marry a minor. There are compelling reasons for states not to allow this, because a sexual relationship between an adult and a minor harms the minor, and because a minor cannot give legal consent to a contract, and marriage is a contract. An age restriction saying that no one over age 70 can marry would have no compelling state interest and not even a rational basis. An age restriction saying that no one can marry someone 20 years older or younger would also have not compelling state interest and no rational basis, unless the younger person is a minor. So some age restrictions are reasonable, but not all age restrictions. \n \n The argument that age is also \"natural\" makes no sense in this context, because minors do grow up, and they become adults, and then the two parties who seek to marry can do so. If I want to marry someone who is 12, I cannot do that, but I can marry that person when the person reaches the age of legal consent. The restriction does not bar marriage forever on the basis of age. In contrast, the restriction barring people of the same sex from marrying bars a same-sex couple from marrying forever. There is no compelling state interest in such a bar, as same-sex marriage harms no one and denies no one any rights. The bans on same-sex marriage are based purely on prejudice against gay people and on certain people's religious beliefs, neither of which is an acceptable or a constitutional reason for a state to enact a ban.",

You just lose a lot of the relevant discussion, and it does nothing for our perception of your receptiveness to contrary ideas.\nIn general I don't like posting why I blocked posters. I will say it is rare to get blocked by me and I only do so when I feel the poster is not living up to what I expect from him or her. By this I mean if you are in middle school I expect one thing and if you are in college I expect another and if you are a professional I expect different as well.

Can you really expect a middle school kid to provide much to a discussion without simply insulting? It's not a hard to standard to live up to. \n \n In any event, this is the first and last time I talk about how I react to posts so any replies are not going to get replies from me :) Hope its been helpful.\n \n \nOh... and Ohioprof wants you to know she is not a he.\nMy apologies.

   "Yet still caused, at least in part, by environmental factors. That's all I need to know. And as any sexual orientation is behavior and not genetic (like skin color), I don't think you can compare the two like you do.\n\n \n How? Name one environmental factor known to cause homosexuality. You do need to know that in order to be able to make your claim -- with a straight face, anyway. The reason the APA sticks in \"environmental\" factors is that it isn't yet possible to exclude them categorically from having any influence on sexual orientation, no matter how tiny, but there is no evidence that they have such an influence, nor that if they do, it is significant for the vast majority of individuals. \n \n Added in edit: I can't believe anyone in the 21st century can still be trotting out the silly canard that \"sexual orientation is behaviour\". Steve, my dear, I am just as gay when I am asleep as when I am actively boinking some handsome studmuffin. Or muffette, come to that. (Not that many handsome studmuffins come my way these days, but they used to.) Sexual orientation is emphatically NOT A BEHAVIOUR! It is not situational. It's a state of mind, a psychological reality, an integral part of everyone's psyche. Now you might not have thought about this because as a straight person, you have never in your life been forced to think about what makes you straight and statistically \"normal\". Gay people do not have that luxury, and frankly we have more insight into sexual orientation than you appear to have, making statements of that sort that are manifestly untrue.\n \n \nI never claimed a democracy doesn't have flaws. I claim it is better than any other system. If you start claiming some things are outside the vote then you have to have someone establish what those things are. You know create an all power person or persons and I find that much more dangerous than the possibility of a vast majority denying human rights to some of us.\n\n \n And one of the ways of overcoming some of these flaws is set up a constitutional republic, as the founders did with the United States, that establishes the protection of basic rights and liberties against a government that might wish (according to the will of the majority of the people) to abolish them.\n \n Such protections are essential if we are to avoid mob rule.",

However, the opinion of a mob does not create or abolish rights -- it can only determine whether rights are respected or not.

A major reason why many of the framers of the constitution, including Madison initially, did not want to include a bill of rights is that they feared that people would interpret this as meaning that only those rights explicitly named in the document would be protected, and they did not want to limit rights to those that they happened to think of and include. Madison came around to supporting a bill of rights, and he wrote that he felt okay about this because of the presence of the 9th amendment, which would guarantee that rights not specifically named in the document would still be protected. Of course, that is what we have debated so passionately in various threads in this forum: what Madison and the framers meant by the ninth amendment. So far in our constitutional history, the 9th amendment has not been used as a guarantee that the constitution protects rights not specifically named, though a few justices have alluded to it as doing precisely that. There is evidence from Madison himself that he intended for the 9th amendment to do this. But the 9th has been mostly a sleeping amendment, not used to do what I think Madison intended: to provide for constitutional protection for rights not specifically named in the constitution. Instead, the Supreme Court has interpreted other amendments as protecting rights not specifically named, such as the right to privacy.",

(They apply a different level of scrutiny depending on the type of discrimination or whether a right violated is a fundamental right.) In other words, a person has the right to marry the spouse of his or her choice. That's the presumption of liberty. A state can deny this right, but the state has to have a damn good reason for denying the right.....a compelling state interest, as marriage is a fundamental right, according to the Supreme Court.\n\n \n You are talking about your constitution and the rights enshrined in it. With that I am in agreement with you.\n \n BUT what I am saying is that in nature there are no absolute rights.

   "Given all the variations then, we are agreed there are no absolutes ?\n\n \n Speaking as someone with scientific training, while I might agree there may be few eternal and universal absolutes in ethics -- and human rights is surely a branch of ethics -- because ethical actions are contextually sensitive, that doesn't exclude the possibility of forbidden values. \"Relative\" ethics does not translate into \"anything goes\" ethics... there can still be constraints on what you can and cannot do ethically, even if what is left allows a fair amount of flexibility, depending on circumstances.\n \n \nPresumably also that those who wish to expand the notions must also have damn good arguments in order to convince the rest ?\n\n \n Yes, but we provide them, and they are generally pretty good reasons. All the folk you find here arguing for the legitimacy of restriction of human rights for gay people, such as Phyllis and Steve and Archangel and Feindwhatsit, and indeed yourself, are unable to provide a rational argument for doing so.

The original constitution provided for majority voting only for the House of Representatives, and not for the Senate or the Presidency. The President is still not elected by majority vote; it he had been, Al Gore would have been President. The original constitution provided for U.S. Senators to be chosen by the states, not by a majority vote of the people.

(See Gordon Wood's brilliant book The Creation of the American Republic.) Some scholars have argued that a goal of the framers was to put more power into the hands of the elite, whom they regarded as best suited to govern. Also, voting was never among the rights specifically enumerated in the Bill of Rights, and the decision about who could vote was, and mostly still is, left up to the states. \n \n One can make an argument that over time, the constitution has been amended and interpreted to be more democratic in nature than it was originally.

You only resort to saying something along the lines of \"they did to cover all bases\" which is a baseless claim. \n \n In fact, I just read an article today about the subject entitled: \"Childhood Family Correlates of Heterosexual and Homosexual Marriages: A National Cohort Study of Two Million Danes\". The study suggests some environmental factors of homosexual marriage including divorce and age of parents. \n \n The study can be retrieved at http://www.springerlink.com (search archives of sexual behavior) but I have not yet received permission to post anything about it.\n \n But as I said, if you aren't convinced by what is said then no amount of evidence is going to change that.\n \n \nI'd sooner compare religious belief to alcoholism -- it's an addiction that hurts other people as well as the believer.\nDon't avoid the point.

   "[QUOTE=Steeeeve;290016]In thus you force your views on me. Currently my views are the prevailing ones so a change in that would you being your views forced on me....well this assumes you lived in the US.\n QUOTE]\n \n It sounds to me like you are trying to force your views on everyone else through the power of the state. You apparently want the state to adhere to your peculiar religious beliefs and impose those beliefs on everyone.\n \n Just because YOU believe that same-sex relationships are \"sinful\" doesn't mean you can or should ram your beliefs down the throats of everyone through laws that reflect your peculiar view of \"morality.\" \n \n You claim that your views are the \"prevailing\" ones. That depends on where in the United States you are talking about. In Massachusetts, the only state currently with legal same-sex marriage, polls show a majority of people there support same-sex marriage. Gallup polls now show that a majority of people now believe that \"homosexuality is an acceptable alternative lifestyle.\" While I dislike the wording of the poll question, since being gay is not a \"lifestyle,\" I think it's interesting that attitudes have change to the point where the majority now accepts gay people rather than condemning us. The trend over time has been toward greater acceptance of us and toward the equal treatment of gay people under the law. \n \n Beyond that, I will point out to you that for most of American history, the \"prevailing\" views of Americans have been racist. The fact that most people in the South supported racial segregation did not make racial segregation right. The fact that most people across the nation opposed inter-racial marriage did not make anti-miscegenation laws right. \n \n For much of American history, the \"prevailing\" view of Americans was that women should not have the right to vote. The fact that most people across the nation opposed women voting did not make the denial of the vote to women right. \n \n For most of American history, the \"prevailing\" view of Americans has been that people should not have the right to marry a spouse of the same sex. The fact that most people believed or believe this does not make the denial of marriage to gay people right.",

I've never seen a pro-gay rights advocate move to a position of support of anti-gay legislation, but I've seen the reverse often enough.\n \n And the movement of opinion in society as a whole mirrors that direction, with younger people being less bigoted than their elders. \n \n As to what to do, well, there's a question there will never be unanimous agreement on! Options range from the do-nothingness of the wishy-washy middle that doesn't want to rock the boat, to violent insurrection.

   "Well, while I think the treatment of gay citizens is an important issue, it's certainly not the sole criterion on which a nation should be judged. Also, I'd argue that had it not been for the success of the American revolution and the ideas on which it was based, and which it subsequently nurtured, the dissolution of the British empire might not have been as civilized as it mostly was. The US Constitution has been used as a basis or influence on those of many other states, including Commonwealth ones, as have the principles on which it is based.\nI do agree with you there. We learned very valuable lessons form the War of Independence, and yes it would have been much worse without learning them. Of course just because it lead to useful lessons, doesn't mean it was right. Being arrested for assault may be a useful lesson for me, but it doesn't justify my initial act...\n \n In the end however, I still don't think rebellion is warranted, least of not there. If the British were rounding up citizens into concentration camps and killing them, maybe there is justification. Arms against your government due to disagreements over taxation and voting rights? As much as I think the colonists were right in their demands, they were utterly wrong in their actions.\n \n \nAnd Brown's government is toying with the idea of introducing a written constitution in the same tradition as the American one.\nGagh, well the day I support him...\n \n \nI don't think gays in the West have much justification for violent resistance to oppression and persecution, and probably didn't any time in the last century -- the West is susceptible to Gandhian tactics of political change, and has a long tradition of reform, with extremely rare revolutions. However, not all governments deserve that sort of loyalty and forbearance. Violence is never the ideal answer to anything, but sometimes it is the only answer possible, given the circumstances. (This is not to be read as justifying any current or contemplated instances of terrorism, of course, I'm talking in the abstract, and each case has to be judged on its own merits.)\nAnd again, where is the line? I agree that Gandhi's way was utterly laudable, and achieved success with amazing restraint. I'd concede if people were actively being killed for their beliefs, then harsher action is probably warranted. That wasn't the case in British America, and it's not the case with homosexuality today.

   "For most of American history, racists did not think they were bigots. \n\n \n But this is a non-sequitor; it does not follow that because racists were bigots, that people who oppose gay rights are bigots. Are car mechanics also bigots? How about astronauts? The fact one group doesn't think they are bigots has no bearing whatsoever on other groups pertaining to different issues. There's a difference between saying something needs to be changed and saying that it's bigotry.\n \n The glaring difference with the racism comparison when it comes to gay rights is that opposition toward homosexuality in society is mostly over actions--it rarely has to do with innateness. The opposition toward black people was more over the fact they were just different and viewed as inferior. I think the gay pride movement has done a good job of convincing itself that the same applies to gays, but I don't think it does, particularly among religious groups. Now none of this is to say that opposition toward gays in terms of actions is a good thing--I think people should mind their own business. But it's not the same as racism.\n \n \nOne of the first and most significant steps of any movement for equality is to change the popular consciousness to view that which had been the norm as evil or wrong or in need of change.\n\n \n I'd have no problem with this except that I don't think it has been done with honesty, in the case of the gay pride movement. As I said, one of the biggest problems I have with the gay rights movement is that it seems determined to portray religious belief as irrational prejudice, and it's just not true that it is in many cases. There's no real difference between the religious belief that gay relations are wrong and the belief among some religious people that eating pork is wrong. That's not bigotry, but rather a simple religious belief. I think religious people should be free to believe what they want as long as they keep it to themselves. But they shouldn't have people dishonestly reframeing their belief as bigotry when it's not.\n \n \nI think that the religious right is fighting desperately to hold onto the older view about sexual orientation, which is that sexual orientation does not even exist, and people simply fall into \"sin\" by engaging in sex with people of the same sex.\n\n \n This is true in a sense, though it's not an \"older view of sexual orientation.\" It's simply a matter of the gay rights movement changing the focus of the debate, trying to change it to an issue of innateness rather than actions and behavior. The thing is though, I think the reason there has been some success in changing peoples' attitudes isn't because gay rights people have persuaded religious people to abandon their beliefs in favor of \"it's-ok-'cause-its-innate\", but because religious people are realising that it's just not that important of a fight. That there are much more important things to draw a line in the sanfYou may have more and more religious people warming to the idea of gay marriage, but that doesn't mean they are saying gay sex is ok in the eyes of God. There's a difference between the LEGAL issue and the MORAL one. You've persuaded them in terms of constitutionality (well, more of them anyway than it used to be), but I suspect not so much in terms of abandoning their religious beliefs about behavior.",

Of course, there is a lot of bigotry against the eaters of pork, the gentiles, in history and even today amongst Orthodox Jews.

It was nothing more than another form of bigotry.\n \n \nSo you really think it's all just hatred, regardless? No distinction whatsoever toward those who simply have religious beliefs but harbor no ill-will toward gay people themselves?\n\n \n Well, what else can it be? You can't \"hate the sin and love the sinner\" in this case, because being gay is integral to who we are as people. If you hate our love, you hate us. People who harbour such religious beliefs do not exactly have no ill will towards those they have been taught to hate.

After all, lots of different people have been tortured all throughout history for many reasons. (including Christians.) If it's not going to be an issue of degree to any extent, then someone who got called a name in the 3rd grade for being overweight could reasonably compare themselves to the plight of black people in terms of all they've been through. Degree does matter. There's nothing wrong with looking at an issue and making some determination whether or not a comparison fits or not. Yes, you can say both gays and blacks have experienced injustice. (Indeed they have.) But then if we're going say degree doesn't matter here (as you're basically saying), you can also say that any incident, no matter how trivial, could be comparable to the plight that blacks have experienced under racism. Perhaps the civil rights movement and racism are invoked because they are examples of where it became the moral high ground to oppose racism. That's fair enough, but there's nothing wrong with society looking at this issue and asking if it's really comparable or not. If you're confident in your case of using the comparison, then I'd think you would welcome people doing so, even in terms of degree! You can argue that gays HAVE suffered to some similar degree, and maybe you'd even be right.\n \n \nQuite often, people aren't really aware of what their bigotry entails. That's why we have so many people denying that homophobia is bigotry -- they just don't see their particular prejudice as bigotry, but they see prejudice against them as bigotry.\n\n \n I have no problem with the idea that homophobia is a form of bigotry. I just have a problem with the idea of ascribing homophobia where that might not even be what's going on.\n \n \nInteresting you bring up the pork eating comparison to homophobia.\n\n \n No, I brought it up in comparison to religious belief, not homophobia (the point being that the two are not always one and the same). I believe you may have missed my point. When semitic people don't eat pork, it's often out of religious belief, not necessarily hatred. (the word you used.) In the same way, when religious people hold to the view that gay relations are wrong, they may do so out of religious belief, not necessarily hatred. Just because this particular issue involves same-gender doesn't mean automatically that it's a hate-related matter.\n \n \nWell, what else can it be?\n\n \n Religious belief.\n \n \nYou can't \"hate the sin and love the sinner\" in this case, because being gay is integral to who we are as people.\n\n \n Sure you can. One's moralistic view about an action need not necessarily depend on whether that given action is done out of innateness. Indeed, there are cases where moralistic belief should run contrary to what is integral to a given person.",

   "But this is a non-sequitor; it does not follow that because racists were bigots, that people who oppose gay rights are bigots. Are car mechanics also bigots? How about astronauts? The fact one group doesn't think they are bigots has no bearing whatsoever on other groups pertaining to different issues. There's a difference between saying something needs to be changed and saying that it's bigotry.\n\n \n Bigotry is directed at people. It's rooted in negative beliefs about a group of people because of who they are. A car mechanic is only a bigot if he directs hatred at a group of people because of who they are. An astronaut is only a bigot if he directs hatred at a group of people because of who they are. \n \n Racists have usually directed hatred at African Americans and people from other racial and ethnic minority groups. People who are anti-gay usually direct hatred at gay people, bisexual people, and transgender people. There is the parallel. Directing hatred at a group of people because of who they are is an expression of bigotry, regardless of whether the group consists of African Americans, or gay people, or people from the Middle East, or Catholics.",

   "The glaring difference with the racism comparison when it comes to gay rights is that opposition toward homosexuality in society is mostly over actions--it rarely has to do with innateness. The opposition toward black people was more over the fact they were just different and viewed as inferior.\n\n \n You are wrong about this. This is my area of scholarship; I research and study African American history and the history of racism, and so this is something I know about. \n \n The oppression of and discrimination against African Americans was almost always rationalized in terms of black people's \"behavior.\" Pro-slavery whites argued that God intended black people to be enslaved because of the sin of Ham. They claimed that Africans and people of African descent were to be perpetually enslaved because of Ham's sinful behavior. Pro-slavery whites also argued that black people were inclined to run amock unless they were closely controlled. They argued that black men would rape white women and black women, Jezebels, would lure white men into sexual relations, thus producing a \"mulatto race\" of people and pulling down the white race. When slavery ended, racist whites argued that black people had to be kept separate from whites and controlled through segregation laws because they were likely to engage in crime, in rape of white women, and in unrestrained sexuality, drinking, and bad behavior. The argument for segregation laws, advanced in the case of Plessy v. Ferguson before the Supreme Court, was an argument about controlling behavior, specifically the behavior of black people. Lynching, that horrible crime that left thousands of African Americans tortured and dead, was nearly always justified by the lynchers as payback for black \"behavior,\" usually an alleged rape of a white woman. \n \n Of course, we look at this now and see clearly that the \"behavior\" argument was used to try to justify attacking people purely because of who they are. The argument about black \"behavior\" was an attempt to mask bigotry in the guise of social good, to blame black people for the repression that whites forced on them, to claim that discrimination was necessary because of black \"behavior.\" \n \n Now let's look at the repression that heterosexuals have forced on gay people. Those who seek to continue the discrimination against gay people make arguments nearly identical to the arguments made by the racists over the course of American history. They argue that gay people's \"behavior\" is harmful to society....that gay people are promiscuous, that gay people molest children, that gay people represent sexuality run amock. They make arguments about \"behavior,\" but really, the objection to gay people is based not on our \"behavior\" but on who we are. People have been assaulted for being gay simply because they look \"gay,\" which usually means a man looks effeminate or a woman looks masculine. People don't really attack gay people over what gay people do in bed. People who hate gay people don't see gay people in bed. They attack gay people for how we appear on the street, for gay people's violation of gender norms, usually. \n \n One difference between the arguments anti-gay people have made about gay people and the arguments racists have made about African Americans is that no one argued for turning African Americans into whites, while there are those who argue for trying to turn gay people into heterosexuals. Usually the worst anti-gay bigots don't bother with the idea of turning gay people into heterosexuals; they just beat us up. But there are those who argue that gay people can be coaxed or preached at or shamed into becoming heterosexual. In that sense, the arguments aimed at gay people have resembled the arguments aimed by whites at Native Americans. While racists did not tell African Americans that they could turn white, some did tell Native Americans that they could turn white. They urged Native Americans to give up their \"savage\" Indian behavior and embrace white behavior. That was the purpose of Indian schools: to teach Native Americans to give up their \"sinful\" Indian behavior and customs and adopt white people's behavior. \n \n Is racism the same as anti-gay oppression? They sure look a lot alike if you examine the arguments advanced to try to justify both forms of oppression. Those who support both racism and anti-gay oppression have tried to justify that oppression by pointing to the allegedly sinful and immoral and socially harmful \"behavior\" of the people who are being oppressed. With both racism and anti-gay oppression, the people promoting the oppression have sought to blame the people being oppressed for causing the discrimination and oppression that they face.",

   "Well, no, I think it IS one of degree, to some extent anyway.\n\n \n Fine. So slaves suffered more than gay people. If it comforts you to thinkthat, I can't stop you from thinking it. At least slaves had the comfort of religion and community. Gay people were always alone in facing the bigotry of homophobia.\n \n \nAfter all, lots of different people have been tortured all throughout history for many reasons. (including Christians.) If it's not going to be an issue of degree to any extent, then someone who got called a name in the 3rd grade for being overweight could reasonably compare themselves to the plight of black people in terms of all they've been through.\n\n \n Well, we do have laws preventing discrimination against people on the grounds of their religious beliefs. There are few such laws protecting people on the grounds of their sexual orientation. That is still allowable bigotry.\n \n \nDegree does matter.\n\n \n The fact that one person's injustice was greater than another's doesn't mean that only that person's injustice matters. It's still a matter of injustice born of bigotry. Lynchings still go on, with gay victims.\n \n \nPerhaps the civil rights movement and racism are invoked because they are examples of where it became the moral high ground to oppose racism. That's fair enough, but there's nothing wrong with society looking at this issue and asking if it's really comparable or not.\n\n \n They are invoked because of the moral and historical similarities. you can turn a blind eye, but you will not convince anyone who isn't already a bigot.\n \n \nI have no problem with the idea that homophobia is a form of bigotry. I just have a problem with the idea of ascribing homophobia where that might not even be what's going on.\n\n \n I read what religious people have to say about gays, and I can recognise bigotry when i see it.\n \n \nWhen semitic people don't eat pork, it's often out of religious belief, not necessarily hatred.

Just because this particular issue involves same-gender doesn't mean automatically that it's a hate-related matter.\n\n \n If religious people think gay sex is wrong, they are most welcome not to have it. The same way they are most welcome not to eat pork. They aren't welcome to stop other people from having it, or even to criticise other people for having it. Abstaining from gay sex or not eating pork should be their burden. They have no business foisting it on others.\n \n When they DO attempt to foist their beliiefs on others, that is a symptom of hatred for people who are different. if they didn't hate us, why would they be homophobes?\n \n \nReligious belief.\n\n \n Well, quite. It's responsible for much evil.\n \n \nOne's moralistic view about an action need not necessarily depend on whether that given action is done out of innateness. Indeed, there are cases where moralistic belief should run contrary to what is integral to a given person.\n\n \n I'd hope that someone's moral views were based on the harm that actions cause. Gay love in itself causes no harm to anyone. It's a constructive virtue. The harm religious homophobia causes is prodigious. I'd be more impressed with the morality of religious believers if they defended gays against the homophobes in their midst. I'd be even more impressed if they amended their religion to excise homophobia.",

   "Hmmmm. Maybe I missed something or you did. I'm not sure anyone seriously says violent revolution against the government... however, peaceful protesting and seeking changes in laws is certainly in order. And I think as we are fighting back, we do need to physically defend ourselves from roaming homophobes set out to do some physical damage against us.. \nI was just going by the original post. Matthew says \"tyranny of the majority as being imposed upon the civil rights of gay american citizens is a just cause to change the government\". When stated directly after a quote that was used to justify armed revolution against the government, I take it to be advocating the same thing.\n \n \nOh, I mean no disrespect, actually. I only use the 3 letter word as gay is a three letter word.\nNo disrespect felt. All I was saying was that I just wasn't familiar with the term. Must be an American term.\n \n \nI guess it depends on how you are defining revolution. Physically fighting the US government would be ridiculous, given the size of our population. I would say it's more of a pacifist revolution. \nWell then I tenuously support that. It's also worth noting there are plenty of insurgent organizations about that have done significant damage despite possessing no real numbers. They'll never overthrow, but that doesn't stop them.\n \n \nI'm not sure I understand \"symbolically dictatorial\"... are you talking about the monarchy? \nSorry, yes I was. \n \n \nI think the UK has amazing rights for homosexuals--one tick below Canada, Spain and the Netherlands. Looks like civil marriages are soon to become full-blown marriages in the next few years. I think it's amazing. I am moving to London for a job in the next weeks and I had to research all about immigration issues. It was nice to see civil partners treated exactly the same as a heterosexual spouses. Now that's progress!\nAnd that's my point, I guess. That despite all the revolution's proclamations of doing it for freedom and equality they actually end up under a more oppressive State than both the British and the colonies that stayed loyal (ie Canada). I just feel it's ironic, is all. And somewhat vindicated in my Monarchist/ You shouldn't take up arms against your government stance.\n \n That said, Canada obviously beats us on this one though by fully legalizing gay marriage.\n \n \nBut if a government is inhumane to its citizens, then perhaps a putsch is in order. Living under the Bush cartel, life is a little skewed. I'm glad it's almost over. I don't care who gets in, anything has to be better than this loser. There is so much work that needs to be done an all fronts. Much of the angst you see on these boards stem from the shear frustration beyond equal rights for gays. This administration has seriously fvcked up the entire world. Venting frustration is a good thing, as long as it doesn't lead to violence.\nI appreciate.

That's all I'm trying to say.\n\n \n Yes, I am saying that the real reason black people were and still are oppressed is because of who they are, and the \"behavior\" used to rationalize the oppression has always been merely a rationalization for oppression and discrimination. I am arguing that the same is true for the oppression of gay people. People may claim they oppose \"gay behavior,\" but that's not really why they oppress gay people. People oppress and discriminate against gay people because of who we are. When we remain invisible, people really don't care about what gay people do in private and in secret. They know we exist, but so long as we are invisible, they are fine with that. It's when we started becoming visible that the hatred against us rose to the surface. When we became visible for who we are. the backlash against us became furious. People rationalized it as religious objections to \"gay behavior,\" but they apparently had not problem with this \"gay behavior\" so long as we were silent and invisible. \n \n You mentioned that you have known many religious people who do not hate gay people; they just oppose same-sex relations. Yes, there are many such people, just as there were many white people who did not hate black people; they just opposed desegregation. People can be very nice and polite while they support discrimination and oppression against others. Are they motivated by hate? Most are probably not motivated by hate in a personal sense. They believe they are doing right and standing by God's word, just as supporters of racial segregation believed they were doing right and standing by God's word. Most would probably never be mean to an actual gay person in their lives, just as most white people were not personally mean to any black person in the era of legal segregation. \n \n Oppression and discrimination are deeper and wider than individual psychology. They become institutionalized, in the form of barriers to certain groups having full equality under the law and in the culture generally. Oppression and discrimination become part of the culture and part of the laws. Individual people don't have to be hateful to participate in a culture where hatred is institutionalized. They perpetuate the oppression and discrimination without being aware of it, by taking the discrimination and oppression for granted as the norm. This is what Hannah Arendt called \"the banality of evil.\" To paraphrase Monty Python, this shows the hatred inherent in the system. \n \n I think one group that has suffered very deeply from this institutionalization of inequality is the poor. We see the poor, and we think they are with us always. We blame the poor for being failures, for creating their own suffering through lack of moral worth or a failure to work hard. We pity them. We call them \"trailer trash.\" We see them, and we walk by, mostly indifferent to their circumstances. Sometimes we collect cans of food for them or throw them other crumbs. We do not challenge the system that makes some people poor. We ignore it, and we call it the norm. Tut tut. Too bad. Do we hate the poor? No. We simply accept the system that denies them opportunity, that prevents them, at every turn, from improving their circumstances. They can pull themselves up by their bootstraps, we say. It's their fault and their problem if they have no boots. We don't have to hate the poor. We have institutionalized the oppression and discrimination that they face, and we don't ever have to acknowledge that we are participating in the system that makes some people poor.",

If someone is \"participating\" in a culture where there is an element of injustice, does that make them hateful? No, I don't think it does, necessarily. What would make it hateful is if they harbor intentional malevolence--if they were intentionally hateful. For instance, was Thomas Jefferson a hater and bigot because he participated in a culture where slavery was common? I think it would be stretch to say so. That's why I think it's best to leave terms like hated and bigot for those to whom it obviously applies, not people of whom are just not participating in opposition to the system. They're just living their lives--they don't hate gay people. Many, many religious people just have their religious views; they don't hate gays.\n \n\n \n I actually agree with you on most of this post. That doesn't happen often! I think it is true that most people who have \"religious objections\" to \"homosexuality\" are not walking around hating gay people. Many probably do not even know that they know real gay people. They have just been taught to \"object\" to \"homosexuality,\" usually in church or by parents. The same can be said of probably most white people in the South who supported racial segregation. They were taught that segregation was God's will, and it was the norm in their society, and they grew up accepting it and saying they had \"religious objections\" to racial integration. \n \n The danger of letting people off the hook for this, however, is that you allow injustice and oppression and discrimination to remain in place, while finding excuses for those who accept and support injustice and oppression and discrimination. You don't have to \"hate\" people actively to be complicit in injustice and oppression and discrimination. You can simply accept the injustice as the norm and go on wearing a pleasant smile. Many white Southerners wore pleasant, polite smiles as they resisted the Brown decision of 1954 and continued to support segregated schools. \n \n Looking back to 1831, the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison launched a newspaper called [I]The Liberator[I] in which he denounced slaveholders as sinners doomed to hell. But Garrison did more than that. He also denounced as sinners doomed to hell all the white people who sat back and did nothing to end slavery, who supported the slave system by simply accepting it and ignoring it. Garrison charged that these white people were complicit in the evil of slavery, and they were going to hell just as surely as the slaveholders were. \n \n Garrison's rhetoric was extreme, but it served to raise up into public consciousness the presence of institutionalized evil. Garrison effectively forced people, through his rhetoric, to confront the immorality of slavery and to look at their own participation, passive or active, in upholding the slave system. Garrison insisted that people are responsible for the evil in their society that they allow to exist, whether they are actively \"hateful\" or not. \n \n We can say the same thing about other social evils that exist today, including the unequal treatment of gay people. The issue here is not the degree of suffering that people may endure. Matt Shepherd and other gay people who have been murdered and their families certainly suffered to a great degree, just as the victims of all previous lynchings and violent hate crimes have suffered. But the real issue is whether we simply excuse people for advocating continued oppression and discrimination, simply because they do it with a polite smile and because they do it in the name of religion. Most oppression and discrimination has been justified in the name of religion. That doesn't make the oppression and discrimination right.",

   "Of course. I already said \"as long as it doesn't impose on your rights.\" I don't know how much clearer that could be. You keep shifting strictly to the legal issue, when we're talking about the the perception/hate issue. The legal issue is not what I'm talking about here at all.\n\n \n Well, I can tell the difference between legal rights and moral expectations. And I am perfectly entitled to argue on both issues together. I think I am usually extremely clear whether I am making a strictly legal case, or a wider moral one. For example, I am happy to argue so long as the Boy Scouts maintain they are a strictly private organisation, they have a legal right to enforce bigoted membership rules. I can simultaneously argue that although they have a legal right to do this, they are morally wrong when they do it, because they injure the objects of their bigotry as a result.\n \n There is no contradiction there, neither is there any attempt to confuse issues. They are, in fact, two facets of a single issue, and there is no reason we cannot consider them together.\n \n \nMaybe you could be more specific in terms of who you're talking about. Are you JUST talking about religious people who are activists working toward laws against gay people? Or are you talking about any religious person who has the religious view that gay relations are wrong? Please, be specific.\n\n \n Look, you are talking to a former Catholic who was well trained in understanding that although there are differences between sins of commission and omission, they are both still sinful. Anyone who is active against gay rights is being a bigot; anyone who sits back and says nothing in the face of such activism is liable to be suspected of fellow-travelling, at the very least, since silence denotes consent when it does not indicate ignorance. It is extaordinarily difficult to plead ignorance of these issues today.\n \n Is there some refuge, some excuse for religious believers who believe that gay love is sinful? Only if ignorance is counted as an excuse, and only if ignorance is plausible. If someone tells me that gay sex is sinful, I look on them the same way as someone who tells me that 2+2=5. Can they sincerely believe that 2+2=5? Only if they close their eyes to reality.\n \n So no, I do not look fondly on religious people who claim that gay sex is a sin, but they \"love\" the sinner, anyway -- they cannot separate me from my sexual orientation that easily. I do not think such people know what love is about. Their religion is manifestly wrong. I can forgive them, but not without appropriate penance for doing and thinking wrong. They have the legal right to disagree with me, but they cannot expect me to regard them as friends, or as morally righteous.",

These religious folk probably do not \"hate\" individual people -- they just hate what these people are, if they are gay.

That is simply not a reasonable expectation for gay people; neither is it a reasonable expectation that religious believers should love someone despite their refusal to accept that being gay, living gay, is a \"sin\". That isn't love any more, that's some sort of resentment on account of rejection.",

If it's not right to say that non-opposition = participation, then arguing thus is to tell an untruth. To me, the question comes down to: would the emancipation process take place and continue without that sort of extreme rhetoric? Would the slaves have been freed if Garrison had NOT gone as far as he did? You are probably more qualified to answer that question than I am, but I suspect it would. And if that's the case, then there's no need to lie.\n \n But I also think there is a subtle difference here between what we're talking about with people being called \"hateful\" and Garrison's statements. I think it's easier to argue that people are responsible for the evil in society if they sit back and don't do anything than it is to argue that those who are about other business in their lives or even just have different religious views \"hate gays.\" These are two different concepts, IMO. I think the only way someone can rightfully say whether or not someone hates someone else is not by what that person DOESN'T do, but by what they DO. And let's face it: slavery was a lot bigger problem in the 19th century than gays in general are facing. It's just not realistic to hold the public to the level of accountability on this issue, that it was held to in terms of slavery in the 19th century.

I think most people, including most Christians who say they oppose \"homosexuality\" because it's a \"sin,\" do not hate gay people, nor do they truly love gay people. I think they are somewhere in between. Most of them do not really know any gay people, at least not authentically or well. They often hate the idea of \"homosexuality,\" as they have been taught to imagine that idea. \n \n I have been interacting recently with Christians who say that \"homosexuality is a sin.\" I find that most do not regard themselves as \"hating\" gay people. They don't seem to notice gay people. Their arguments come entirely from scripture, and their arguments are usually divorced entirely from real life or from the lives of gay people. When I have brought up gay people, they usually act surprised, like why would someone bring up gay people when the argument, as they see it, is about scripture? The real life experiences of gay people do not cross their minds. They often respond to me by saying, \"We are not talking about gay people. We are talking about the sin of homosexuality as condemned in the Bible.\" Sometimes they talk about people \"struggling with homosexuality,\" and sometimes they talk about the transforming power of God in leading people to become \"ex-gays.\" But their view of things is shaped entirely by scripture, not by experiences with gay people or by any knowledge of real gay people. \n \n I am not saying that to minimize or excuse the things they end up saying, based on their interpretation of scripture. But the motivation of most of these particular Christians does not appear to be hatred. Most of them harbor prejudice and misconceptions about gay people. They mostly engage in a rote and rigid adherence to the interpretation of the Bible that they have been taught, all the while insisting that they are not interpreting scripture, just witnessing for Christ and speaking the truth revealed by God.\n \n My argument is that these Christians, who personally do not hate gay people, nevertheless perpetuate oppression and discrimination against gay people, by supporting institutionalized oppression and discrimination.\n \n The problem with turning to these Christians and accusing them of hating gay people is that they entirely reject that argument, and they then accuse the accusers of hating Christians. They reject the argument because it makes no sense to them. They are not aware of the fact that they support institutionalized oppression and discrimination. In their world view, people who fall into the \"sin\" of homosexuality need help to overcome their addiction and their fall away from God. They express great concern that gay people, whom they don't really know, will go to hell for our \"sin.\" \n \n I think that, for the most part, accusing people of \"hatred\" against gay people is counter-productive, because it just alienates them, and they don't hear what we are saying about our lives or about the impact that their support for institutionalized oppression and discrimination has on real people.\n \n One approach that does seem to garner their support is talking about those Christians who obviously DO hate and attack gay people, like Reverend Fred Phelps. The Christians with whom I have been interacting don't like him one bit, and they insist that he is not truly Christian and is not truly acting in the name of Christ. I have been encouraging the Christians with whom I've been interacting to speak out more against the actions of people like Fred Phelps and to stand up for the fair treatment of gay people.",

   "This is a difficult question, in my view. I think most people, including most Christians who say they oppose \"homosexuality\" because it's a \"sin,\" do not hate gay people, nor do they truly love gay people. I think they are somewhere in between. Most of them do not really know any gay people, at least not authentically or well. They often hate the idea of \"homosexuality,\" as they have been taught to imagine that idea. \n \n I have been interacting recently with Christians who say that \"homosexuality is a sin.\" I find that most do not regard themselves as \"hating\" gay people. They don't seem to notice gay people. Their arguments come entirely from scripture, and their arguments are usually divorced entirely from real life or from the lives of gay people. When I have brought up gay people, they usually act surprised, like why would someone bring up gay people when the argument, as they see it, is about scripture? The real life experiences of gay people do not cross their minds. They often respond to me by saying, \"We are not talking about gay people. We are talking about the sin of homosexuality as condemned in the Bible.\" Sometimes they talk about people \"struggling with homosexuality,\" and sometimes they talk about the transforming power of God in leading people to become \"ex-gays.\" But their view of things is shaped entirely by scripture, not by experiences with gay people or by any knowledge of real gay people. \n \n I am not saying that to minimize or excuse the things they end up saying, based on their interpretation of scripture. But the motivation of most of these particular Christians does not appear to be hatred. Most of them harbor prejudice and misconceptions about gay people. They mostly engage in a rote and rigid adherence to the interpretation of the Bible that they have been taught, all the while insisting that they are not interpreting scripture, just witnessing for Christ and speaking the truth revealed by God.\n \n My argument is that these Christians, who personally do not hate gay people, nevertheless perpetuate oppression and discrimination against gay people, by supporting institutionalized oppression and discrimination.\n \n The problem with turning to these Christians and accusing them of hating gay people is that they entirely reject that argument, and they then accuse the accusers of hating Christians. They reject the argument because it makes no sense to them. They are not aware of the fact that they support institutionalized oppression and discrimination. In their world view, people who fall into the \"sin\" of homosexuality need help to overcome their addiction and their fall away from God. They express great concern that gay people, whom they don't really know, will go to hell for our \"sin.\" \n \n I think that, for the most part, accusing people of \"hatred\" against gay people is counter-productive, because it just alienates them, and they don't hear what we are saying about our lives or about the impact that their support for institutionalized oppression and discrimination has on real people.\n \n One approach that does seem to garner their support is talking about those Christians who obviously DO hate and attack gay people, like Reverend Fred Phelps. The Christians with whom I have been interacting don't like him one bit, and they insist that he is not truly Christian and is not truly acting in the name of Christ. I have been encouraging the Christians with whom I've been interacting to speak out more against the actions of people like Fred Phelps and to stand up for the fair treatment of gay people.\n\n \n Well, I understand where you are coming from when you make this case, but respectfully, I do not entirely agree. Members of the KKK, for example, do not consider themselves racists or bigots because they feel their feelings against blacks, Jews, gays, Catholics, etc., are perfectly justified, and they, too, quote scripture. You aren't going to win them over by calling it for what it is: hatred.\n \n I do not aim to win these folk over, because I consider them lost, beyond redemption. They do not think what they feel is hatred, but that is the effect. At the business end of their feelings, they can't really be distinguished from hatred.\n \n You could probably have made a similar sort of argument about many Germans in the Nazi era:\n \n \nThey don't seem to notice gay people. Their arguments come entirely from scripture, and their arguments are usually divorced entirely from real life or from the lives of gay people. When I have brought up gay people, they usually act surprised, like why would someone bring up gay people when the argument, as they see it, is about scripture? The real life experiences of gay people do not cross their minds.\n\n \n Replace gay people with Jews, and scripture with nationalism and politics, and the arguments are pretty similar. They'd have been shocked to be described as anti-semites -- it wasn't about Jews, they'd have argued, it's about making Germany proud of itself again. \n \n Now I don't mean to overdo the analogy here. I do not equate religious people with Nazis, you will be relieved to hear! ;) But what I do hear from many of them, even as you describe them here, is the same sort of inattention to the consequence of their attitudes and actions. Does that make them guilty? I think it does. I do not think they really have ignorance as an excuse. if they are ignorant, it's because they are willfully ignorant, and choose not to understand what they do. I think many Germans did the same thing.\n \n You make the case in mitigation for them that they don't realise what they are doing. Why don't they realise? Haven't there been enough precedents? Hasn't this sort of thing been done to too many peoples, too many times before? Calling them bigots won't make them wake up and smell the ancient coffee grounds?\n \n Well, then, I don't know what will. You say they don't like Phelps, either. I'd suggest that's maybe because Phelps holds up a mirror to them, and they don't like what they see. I know there are many religious people who do NOT fit the picture I've been painting here. I do not mean to generalise. However, I am not willing to overlook those who placidly claim that scripture demands they condemn gays, and therefore it is OK for them to do it. That's the same as those Germans who excused themselves by saying they were just following orders, without considering the consequences of their actions.\n \n I do not excuse them, and I do not excuse religious homophobes, neither am I willing to not call them bigots or homophobes when the label applies. Pharisees or whitened sepulchres... fair to behold on the outside, but rotten within.\n \n We come from similar intellectual backgrounds, you and I, but our life experiences have been different, and I suspect that this is something we'll have to agree to disagree on. I am less willing to cut religious bigots slack. I just don't have the patience for them anymore, perhaps because I no longer really have much patience for religion in general.

   "Indeed if I said being black (or white might make more sense) is wrong then I would be considered a racist. \n\n \n Then when you say that being gay is wrong, that would make you a homophobe by the same argument.\n \n \nThe evidence that skin color is not akin to orientation is easy. There is no one that claims any type of environmental impact for skin color. There is no behavior that goes along with skin color. There is nothing Biblically wrong with skin color.\n\n \n When have I ever said there is anything wrong with skin colour? I leave that to racists. The point is, that there is nothing wrong with gay sexual orientation, which is as fixed and immutable as skin colour. \n \n You claim there is no behaviour associated with skin colour.

There are cultures and communities associated with skin colour. There are behavioural stereotypes, whether they are true or not. There are habits and ways of thinking and doing things.

It just makes you one with them -- there have been black pastors who have said they would stand with the KKK against gays... here's one:\n \n Whose Dream?\n \n\"If the KKK opposes gay marriage, I would ride with them,\" Reverend Gregory Daniels, a black minister from Chicago, announced from the pulpit in February.\n\n \n Well, let him ride with the KKK for as long as they would let him.

And this happens to be a case where doing the accurate thing DOES best serve the cause.\n\n \n I thought I was clear about this. No, I do not think that people who simply believe that \"homosexuality is a sin\" necessarily hate gay people. Some do, but most probably do not. Most people who have said this that I have encountered do not hate gay people. \n \n However, that doesn't let them off the hook, in my view, for the consequences of being complicit in institutionalized discrimination against gay people. Those who object to \"homosexual behavior\" and who support discrimination against gay people out of that belief, by voting to ban same-sex marriage, for example, are promoting discrimination and oppression even though they do not actively or personally hate gay people. Those who object to \"homosexual behavior\" and do nothing to counter the discrimination and oppression of gay people are also complicit in institutionalized discrimination and oppression, by doing nothing to end it. They can't be forced to stand up and end oppression, but we can certainly encourage them to. \n \n You may not think this discrimination and oppression are a big deal, because you are not gay, and so you don't experience this discrimination and oppression. If you listen to most gay people, including the gay people who post here, we are in agreement that the discrimination is a big deal. We know it is because it affects us personally. \n \n The question for me is how most effectively to go out and to challenge the beliefs and actions of those who oppose equal and fair treatment for gay people. My hope is that over time, we can get most people to accept gay people as equals under the law and in society, even though they may \"object to homosexuality.\" The issue for me is not really that some people \"object to homosexuality.\" They can object all they want, so long as they do not, out of that objection, enact laws that discriminate against us. \n \n There are still people who \"object\" to inter-racial marriage. But they can no longer use their objection to prevent other people from having an inter-racial marriage. That is my goal for the treatment of gay people. People can object to homosexuality and to same-sex marriage till the cows come home, and that's fine with me. But I don't want them to be able to prevent me from living my life or from getting married to the person of my choice because of their personal or religious \"objection.\"",

   "I believe God condemns all sin and so do those others you mentioned. I guess if that's the definition then so be it.\n\n \n And you are welcome to believe whatever you want about that. You are not welcome to preach to me about it, and whenever you try, you will get a strongly negative reaction. I can't (and wouldn't even want to) stop you from using public accommodations to preach to others willing to listen to what you're selling, but that doesn't mean I have to welcome it -- still less condone it. All I am obliged to do is tolerate your freedom to preach your religion, not your assumed right to impose it on others.\n \n \nReligious thoughts are partly genetic? Please show me some evidence for this.\n\n \n It's speculative. Neuroscientists know that certain drugs and brain injuries result in cases of hyper-religiosity, so some (not all) believe that it is possible the human brain is built in a way that makes it a fruitful breeding ground for religious ideas. If so, then it's possible there is some genetic predisposition to believe in some sort of religion or pseudo-religion. Specific religious ideas, of course, are learned. The supposition here is that there may be a religious instinct, and also a moral instinct, both analogous to the language instinct, which is a theoretical concept (all such concepts in science are theories) based on the fact that the human mind apparently comes preprogrammed to learn the grammatical structures that make language possible -- specific parts of the brain are dedicated to learning specific parts of language, and that constrains the structure of languages.\n \n I wouldn't worry too much about it at present -- not enough is known even to develop a good scientific theory yet about the neurological causes of religiosity.\n Nope. You can change your skin colour with chemicals if you're daft enough to want to. I can't bleach my sexual orientation away, even if I were daft enough to want to.\n\nSo now they are not the same. Pick a side!\n\n \n Well, skin colour is genetic, and it's a biological trait, as is sexual orientation, though its causes are more complex than a simple genetic trait like skin colour. At any rate, it makes as much sense to discriminate against people for having the \"wrong\" skin colour as it is if they have the \"wrong\" sexual orientation.\n \n BTW, Ohioprof is correct about race: it is more of a social construct than a biologically useful category. Race is a very fuzzy and elastic concept, and many biologists and anthropologists have little use for it at all, except as a rough marker for population origins and movements.\n \n \nThe problem you have with God is that it requires you to be about something other than yourself, it requires a true love and not a love for yourself.\n\n \n If you can't love yourself, if you are taught to hate yourself (as many Christians teach their gay children), how is it possible to love anyone or anything else? No, my problem isn't with god, it's with people who want to force their vision of god on others. You should know this by now, as I've told you often enough.",

Most people who have said this that I have encountered do not hate gay people. \n\n \n Ok, thanks for the answer.\n \n \nHowever, that doesn't let them off the hook, in my view, for the consequences of being complicit in institutionalized discrimination against gay people. Those who object to \"homosexual behavior\" and who support discrimination against gay people out of that belief, by voting to ban same-sex marriage, for example, are promoting discrimination and oppression even though they do not actively or personally hate gay people. \n \n Those who object to \"homosexual behavior\" and do nothing to counter the discrimination and oppression of gay people are also complicit in institutionalized discrimination and oppression, by doing nothing to end it.\n\n \n Well now, I think there is quite a difference--a major distinction--between someone who isn't concerned about the legal issue and doesn't worry with it (taking no part in the issue at all, pretty much), and someone who is \"voting to ban same-sex marriage.\" Someone voting to ban marriage IS being an activist, and actively working against gay people. \n \n In most cases, I can't go along with the idea of holding people accountable for something they aren't even doing, and this issue isn't an exception IMO.

But slavery was a far more pervasive problem in society and touched so many areas. That's not to belittle what gays deal with; but realistically every potential issue out there of social injustice has to be dealt with on it's own merits, and not every issue is going to rise to the level of oppression that the slaves faced in the 19th century.

However, I certainly think it's a big enough deal to hold those accountable who ARE actively working to take away your rights.\n\n \n I agree with you that there is a difference between someone acting in some fashion to promote discrimination and oppression and someone ignoring discrimination and oppression and doing nothing about them. The first person is someone whose actions against equality we would decry and oppose. The second person is someone we would hope to encourage to act in positive ways, to eliminate discrimination and oppression. \n \n You may say that it's unrealistic to expect someone who believes that \"homosexuality is a sin\" to go out and fight for same-sex marriage, and that is probably true. Since the folks probably do not believe in same-sex marriage, they are almost certainly not going to be persuaded to campaign for it. However, we may realistically hope and expect that people who believe \"homosexuality is a sin\" will speak out against the worst hate crimes directed at gay people. Indeed, if \"homosexuality\" is against the faith of most Christians, so is murder, and so are physical attacks against innocent people. We can call on Christians to work to stop violent attacks against gay people, which are against the beliefs of most Christians (except for people like Fred Phelps and Eric Rudolph and some others). For conservative Christians to do so would be acting for a cause that is consistent with their beliefs. They would also be acting to stop the kind of abuse that clearly does rise to the heinousness of slavery. Lynching is the worst kind of crime imaginable, whether it's lynching of gay people or lynching of African Americans or lynching of Jews or others. We can certainly call upon conservative Christians to stand up against murder and other violent hate crimes, even if they do not support full recognition of the rights of gay people. \n \n A parallel example is the campaign by southern white women from 1930 until the 1940s to stop the lynching of African Americans. The leaders of this campaign were progressive southern white women who personally opposed all forms of racial oppression, including segregation laws. But they targeted their campaign at all southern white women, and in doing that, they did not advocate eliminating segregation laws. Instead, they called on all southern white women to take a stand against, and sign a petition against, the lynching of African Americans, a horrible hate crime that many southern white women opposed. Most of the white women who signed onto the campaign supported racial segregation, usually out of their religious beliefs. But they opposed lynching, and the leaders of this movement were able to gather support across a wide cross-section of southern white women. This was an example of people who opposed racism calling on those who generally supported racism to stand up against the worst form of heinous racist hate crime.",

   "Tell that to Lesz, not me\n\n \n I cannot find any post where Leszek claimed that either race or sexual orientation are mutable. I think this subject needs to be treated carefully, because our use of terms can be confusing. \n \n Did you pull this out of the post about race as a social construction? Race is a social construction, and race is not the same as skin color. Skin color is not mutable, though Michael Jackson has certainly tried to make it so, as did producers of skin whitening products back in the days of racial segregation and overt racism. But the concept of \"race\" is fuzzy, and it has changed with changes in social conventions and changes in law. The concept of race has changed legally over time. People today can choose their race by choosing to call themselves \"bi-racial\" rather than \"African American,\" and many people do that. They are not choosing their skin color or their genes, but they are choosing how to categorize themselves, and race is ultimately a social categorization. \n \n My daughter has brown skin. She notices this all the time. What \"race\" is she? I don't know. She is Guatemalan. That is her national origin. She looks to be at least partly Mayan, and so she is probably partly Native American. Is that a \"race?\" She is not as dark as many Mayan children, which probably means that she is also partly hispanic in origin. Is that a \"race?\"\n \n I think that \"race\" has been mutable over our history, not by individuals, but by society. I think race as a social construction is socially mutable, and we have seen that our social conceptions of race have changed over time. I think that sexual orientation is likewise a social construction, and our categories again have been mutable. I think that we may see a growing emphasis on bisexuality as a category, but I am speculating about this. Saying this does not mean that people choose either their skin color or their attractions. They can choose what to call themselves, how to categorize themselves. That is not the same as choosing their skin color or choosing their attractions.\n \n I could pretend to be attracted to men, and I could legally marry a man. But it would be a pretense, and I know that. I did not choose to be attracted to women; it's just how I am. Other people may be attracted to both men and women. Still others are attracted to men.\n \n One further point. I hear many Christians saying that they do not dislike or harbor prejudice against gay people; they object to gay behavior. But this makes no sense if you think carefully about it. Gay \"behavior\" is no different than heterosexual \"behavior.\" Heterosexuals feel romantic attractions, fall in love, get married, and start families. Gay people feel romantic attractions, fall in love, get married, and start families. The \"behavior\" is no different. The only difference between a gay marriage and a heterosexual marriage is in the sex or gender of the respective spouses. That is the only difference. When gay people fall in love and marry, they are not engaging in different \"behavior\" than heterosexuals are. They are simply marrying a spouse whose sex is the same as theirs.",

Of course, the degree to which skin colour and appearance changes with UV, and how, is a genetic trait. \n \n Biologists are aware there are biological environmental factors in determining sexual orientation, in addition to genetic ones, and this does not mean that sexual orientation is a freely chosen trait.\n \n There remains no evidence that social environment has any influence on orientation whatever. It does however, influence behaviour. Orientation is not the same as behaviour, no matter how determined you are to confuse the two.\n \n \nIf you can change your sexual behavior then why does the argument come up that \"I can't change\" come up when sexual behavior is restricted?\n \n Well, I guess we just disagree on this.\n\n \n I cannot change my sexual orientation, and I am damned if I'll change my behaviour to suit anyone else's religious superstitions. Why should I behave the way your religion insists? I don't care for your religion at all -- I find it rather obnoxious.",
