   "there is no \"neither\" option. make an assessment!\n \n which is better:\n Katy Perry vs. Lady Gaga\n\n \n Lady Gaga-her music is more interesting than Perry's. But to be fair I've only heard a couple songs of Perry's. And the only one I can really remember is\" I Kissed A Girl\"\n \n \nKe$ha vs. Uffie\n\n \n I'm not familiar with these artists.\n \n \nRhianna vs. Chris Brown - oh wait, nevermind.\n\n \n Chris Brown-he has a better voice.\n \n \nJustin Bieber vs. Taylor Swift\n\n Justin Bieber- I really don't care for either of their music, but Bieber makes music moms like so that he can get away with stealing their daughters. Ingenious if you ask me.\n \n \nLil. Wayne vs. Kanye West\n\n \n It really annoys me that I have to say Kanye. Lil Wayne is far worse. But still, Kanye is worthless.\n \n \nT.I. vs. T-Pain\n\n \n I'm not too familiar with them but from the limited selection I've heard I'd have to go with T.I.",
