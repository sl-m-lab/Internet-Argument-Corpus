   " I often wonder how religious people decide that their religion is the \"right one\"?\n \n Consider the following: \n \n 1. Christianity: 2.1 billion\n 2. Islam: 1.5 billion\n 3. Secular/Nonreligious/Agnostic/Atheist: 1.1 billion\n 4. Hinduism: 900 million\n 5. Chinese traditional religion: 394 million\n 6. Buddhism: 376 million\n 7. primal-indigenous: 300 million\n 8. African Traditional & Diasporic: 100 million\n 9. Sikhism: 23 million\n 10. Juche: 19 million\n 11. Spiritism: 15 million\n 12. Judaism: 14 million\n 13. Baha'i: 7 million\n 14. Jainism: 4.2 million\n 15. Shinto: 4 million\n 16. Cao Dai: 4 million\n 17. Zoroastrianism: 2.6 million\n 18. Tenrikyo: 2 million\n 19. Neo-Paganism: 1 million\n 20. Unitarian-Universalism: 800 thousand\n 21. Rastafarianism: 600 thousand\n 22. Scientology: 500 thousand\n \n \n \n \n Please keep in mind that the above listing does not take into account all the different off shoots: IE: Catholic, Protestant, Shiite, Sunny, etc.. Nor is it a listing of ALL the religions throughout the world. So how are you sure you have the RIGHT ONE? Did you do a detailed study of the different religions by reading their holy books or study their history, etc.? This, in my humble opinion, would take most of a lifetime to do. Generally speaking it is the luck of the draw when you were born. This does not seem very fair to me on god's part... does it? Some people were born in the wrong religion and will go to hell based on what the born again crowd teaches. emoticon_frazzled It just does not seem fair! You think that maybe if there is a god he/she/it accepts all and bases his/her/its judgment (up or down) on how you conducted yourself on this earth? Now this would seem truly fair to me!!!\n \n EVERY religious person believes that his/her religion is the \"right one\" just as fervently as you do. So it has to come down to a question of; \"What did you do to make utterly certain that your belief is the right one\"? Seriously!!! What research did you do??? \n \n Who knows... Maybe the religion of the Turnip is the RIGHT one? NOTE: I did not list this one because it has only one follower) emoticon_xbouncer",

This is a maturation process.\n\n \n I think the fact that many atheists grew up religious speaks mainly to two things: one, that most people grow up religious to some extent (so naturally it's going to be that most atheists would have had a religious upbringing), and two, that people sometimes tend to intentionally think their own way rather than that of their parents. A subtle form of rebelling, perhaps. \n \n But the main problem I see with your thinking is that it pre-assumes that religious people don't think for themselves. (hence your statement that becoming atheist is \"learning to think for yourself\".) I think you can really only speak for yourself, because I see no reason that someone becoming religious from being an atheist is not possibly also an example of thinking for oneself and engaging in real self reflection. And, I think many religious people engage in these things and just simply come to different conclusions than you have. I know I have. \n \n \nI do think your charge of arrogance and condescension is unfounded also.

That's the problem I have with what you're saying. Because there could be religious people that DO honestly question, and there could be, conversely, atheists (raised that way) that DON'T honestly question. (after all, a person could be raised to believe there is no god dogmatically, rather than going through a process of questioning and coming to that conclusion.) In many cases it's BOTH honest questioning with two different conclusions having been arrived at.\n \n \nYou persist in characterizing atheism as another \"ism\", another club. People don't choose to be atheist because they see something desirable in that group of folks, that it is a \"turn on\".\n\n \n Fair enough, but that wasn't exactly what I meant. It still doesn't make someone being condescending look any better, and I see that sort of condescending among atheists consistently.

Invariably they were brought up in a Christian country by Christian parents, but that's where it ends for so many.\n \n They won't be brought into too much discussion for fear of embarrassment: they've never read or studied the bible, and therefore can't argue why they believe what they do (and because they don't KNOW what they believe). It's all rather bizarre. As long as they feel that they are being good, that's all that matters. Really, they want religion on their own terms.\n \n As for atheism, I don't think people examine the concept and decide to become atheists.

Being a Methodist or some other vanilla christian is like being a Cubs fan. They were brought up that way, most everyone else they know feels that way. It becomes habit. A non-thinking habit. If they ever thought to examine it, they would not be able to logically defend what is behind their beliefs, assuming they even know what the details are. For most, there is Christmas and Easter and Christmas carols, Nativity scenes and crosses. Amen. Halleluia, let's get home for kickoff. The vast majority of \"christians\" would be horrified if they ever read the bible. \n \n Secondly, people don't \"choose\" atheism. They reject theism. Atheism isn't a sect that people find attractive. Atheist don't have essentially anything in common except for a lack of belief in whatever flavor of theism they were exposed to.

   "There is no need to examine any \"concept\" of atheism.\n\n \n That's you opinion. There have been people who examined it and decided it was not correct, and became religious. So obviously mileage varies.\n \n I think you're missing a very important point here, though a subtle one. What you're describing--a \"lack of belief\" in God would still leave open the possibility that a god might exist. What you're describing is an ambivalence of sorts; a lack of belief. An absence. If you only have a 'lack of belief' then the possibility is left open that a god may be there after all. To definitively state \"THERE IS NO GOD\" you have to go that extra step and say you \"BELIEVE\" there is no god. You have to make conclusions from the evidence or lack thereof. If you look at the evidence, and see that it doesn't point to the existence of a god, then you conclude something. You believe something. But when all you say is that you have a \"lack of belief\", then you can only speak for yourself in that you are missing something: belief, and you aren't really speaking to whether or not god exists in reality. It doesn't speak to whether something is really there. Maybe what you should call yourself is more 'agnostic.' Nevertheless, I think you just want to avoid being pigeon-holed.\n \n Now, this is not me 'hoping' for atheism to be a belief, even though that's basically what you've claimed I'm doing.

Speak for yourself. This has not been my experience in over 65 years on this earth! Furthermore, I would like someone (Actually, a good number of the faithful) to explain to me why they believe that their choice of faith is the \"true and right choice\". What criterion is involved in determining this choice of faith? Is this not the true root of why billions of people have lost or given their lives? \"I follow the teachings of the true faith and you are the misled\" mantra of all the true followers of God's faith. So many \"true believers\" have given their lives for something there must be a thought process involved to cause a person to make such a life ending decision. \n I truly believe that from the part-time faithful all the way up to include the fanatic faithful, use fewer criterions to choose a religion than they do when choosing a vehicle to buy. That is my issue, point and question. If the \"faithful\" just used as much thought as to which religion is right, as they use to order a meal at a restaurant or buy a car, then a whole lot more tolerance for other faiths just might be the result. The Intolerance for any other religion mimics the intolerance for other ethnic origins. There are mystical trappings and social contacts surrounding all religions. Why does a faithful follower choose one religion over another or is it just maybe that the reason is that the person is only exposed \"Ours or Their\" religion during child hood.\n \n In the last fifty six years I have been told only two times why someone chose their faith. One person said they go to the closet church to their house because they did not drive and God knew what was in their heart. Another said that bigotry against ethnic groups within their family church was intolerable and the church they currently attended was more diverse. Both of these people chose their religion to fit into their social scheme and felt that worship was worship no matter which church doors they walked through. Hurray for honesty. Hurray for tolerance for other religions. Hurray for freedom of choice and not blindly following in the footsteps of others.\n So, why is your religion the right religion? What was your criterion for believing in your faith? How do you choose a good religion from a bad religion?\n I also believe that religion is a house of cards built on a \"right religion\" foundation. If you did not properly research the various religions, you cannot say, with conviction, that you have chosen the \"right\" belief.\n In regards to my choice of fonts and colors, I did not know that there was a listed protocol on this site for using various fonts and colors? Or did you mean that the use of the color and fonts was distracting. I will have to check into this. However, I used the fonts and colors simply to bring attention to my original posting.

One faction proclaimed their belief in predestination i.e. God's plan was formulated aeons ago, the die was cast then and the 5 or is it 7 ? 'round ones' were selected by God then. The other faction said no! free will is the essence of mankind and God gave us the choice to chose between salvation or perdition. Why only 5 or 7 of all those millions will choose salvation is beyond me. It seems a pretty dumb choice to choose perdition over salvation.

Maybe you'd find people would be more likely to debate you if you do things the normal way by making an assertion and then attempting to prove that premise YOURSELF that you bring the to table. No one is going to do your work for you. If you really want to know what religion is the correct one, then do your homework yourself and do your own research.

If the \"faithful\" just used as much thought as to which religion is right, as they use to order a meal at a restaurant or buy a car, then a whole lot more tolerance for other faiths just might be the result. The Intolerance for any other religion mimics the intolerance for other ethnic origins. There are mystical trappings and social contacts surrounding all religions.

Both of these people chose their religion to fit into their social scheme and felt that worship was worship no matter which church doors they walked through. Hurray for honesty.
