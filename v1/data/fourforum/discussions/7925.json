   "Ukraine decided to return to world club of Nuclear Powers! And as you must have a hunch Ukraine is going to do it with timely and effective support of its oversea friends. It would be difficult to imagine another looking of Washington especially after Pentagon's declared plans to test low-yield nuclear bunker-busters not far from Las Vegas... \n New \"orange\" power makes no secret that Kiev has come to a decision of setting up nuclear weapons and restarting enriched uranium and plutonium production for military purposes. And Americans have the gall to give the full sanction to it while they are constantly stigmatizing Iran and even menacing it war for its attempts to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes! Well, it is a flash of establishing democratic relations in American style, isn't it?\n But we must timely stop both US ambitions of developing new types of nuclear weapons for US National Missile Defense and Ukraine's tries to reanimate its third largest nuclear arsenal in the world.",

Plus to bring up something else when's the damn SDI Defense System going to be developed? I'm guessing when a nuclear weapon finally goes off :P",
