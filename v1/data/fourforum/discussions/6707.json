   "Ummm...\n \n I think after, but the version was a tad unclear (the Orthodox probably used Greek, the Romans Latin and translations can twist meaning). The Orthodox church say that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father through the Son, the Catholics say the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father and the Son. Otherwise identical: certainly believers in the Virgin Birth.\n \n \n And the Orthodox have a lot of iconography, like the Catholics. Wikipedia:\n \n 'Icons\n \n A fairly elaborate Orthodox Christian prayer corner as would be found in a private home\"A picture is worth a thousand words\", is a good description of one of the original uses for icons. The Orthodox believe that the first icons were painted by the Evangelist Luke of Christ and the Virgin Mary, and that the biblical prohibitions against material depictions have been altered by Christ (as God) taking on material form. Once God took human form, that human form could be depicted. Orthodox regard their depiction of Christ as accurate, with Christ having brown semi-curly hair, brown eyes, and Semitic features - The Virgin Mary being similar). The personal, idiosyncratic and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Orthodox Iconography before the 17th century, when Russian icon painting was strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from both Protestant and Catholic Europe. Greek icon painting also began to take on a strong romantic western influence for a period and the difference between some Orthodox icons and western religious art began to vanish. More recently there has been a strong trend of returning to the more traditional and symbolic representations. Icons are typically paintings on wood, often small. A properly appointed Orthodox home, for example, will have icons hanging on the wall, usually on an eastern facing wall, and in a central location where the family can pray together.'",

Jarchi refutes interpretation, by observing that Hezekiah was nine years old when his father began to reign. Since this being was, as he says, the fourth year of his reign, he must be at this time thirteen years of age. In like manner, Aben Ezra and Kimchi object to it. Besides, his mother could not be called a \"virgin\". For the same reason it cannot be understood of any other son of his either by his wife, as Kimchi thinks, or by some young woman. Moreover, no other son of his was ever lord of Judea, as this Immanuel is represented to be, in Isaiah 8:8, \"the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.\" Nor can it be interpreted of Isaiah's wife and son, as Aben Ezra and Jarchi think. Since the prophet could never call her a \"virgin\", who had bore him children, one of which was now with him. Nor indeed could he call her a \"young woman\", but rather \"the prophetess\", as in Isaiah 8:3, \"and I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son.\" Nor was any son of his king of Judah, as this appears to be, in the place before cited. But the Messiah is here meant, who was to be born of a pure virgin. The word here used signifies a pure virgin in all places where it is mentioned, as Genesis 24:43 Exodus 2:8 Psalms 68:25 Songs 1:3 and 6:8.\n \n http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/m.sion/gill7-14.htm\n \n Jewish Rabbi Rashi, in his comment quoted below, also stresses the youth of the almah. He mentions what other commentators say about the almah who is to bear a child, implying a miraculous birth: \n \n This is the sign: she is a naarah [young girl] and would not be prophesying at her age, but the Holy Spirit will rest on her...Some say the son is Hezekiah, but this is impossible because Hezekiah was born nine years before his father [Ahaz] became king. Some say she was...too young to have a baby. The ot [sign or miracle] is that the young girl shall bear a child. \n \n In addition, Isaiah's wife, who is named as the prophetess in Chapter 8, verse, 3, had already borne a son, Shearjashub [7:3], and would not qualify as the young girl, naarah, that Rashi calls the almah mentioned in Isaiah 7:14. \n \n Rabbinic tradition has gone to great lengths to disprove the tenet of a virgin birth. The rabbis teach, for example, that bethulah is the only word for virgin and that, on the contrary, almah can apply to any young woman.\n \n Yet, Rabbi Radak, in his comment on Isaiah 7:14, believes that the word almah could mean virgin: \n \n Elem means young boy, the male, and almah means young girl [naarah]. Could be a virgin... \n \n The question arises that if only the word bethulah means virgin, why would Radak believe that almah could mean virgin also? \n \n The custom of the times dictated that young girls live at home with their families and that they be chaperoned. Elem and its feminine form, almah, mean someone hidden from sight, concealed, private. \n \n Although the modern-day rabbis teach that bethulah is the only word for virgin, Rashi used another word to describe the almah in Isaiah 7:14 - naarah, which means child or young girl, by implication a virgin. \n \n For example, the Bible, in Genesis 24:16, uses both words, naarah and bethulah to describe Rebekah. And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her...\n \n Targum Onkeles translates the words naarah and bethulah in Genesis 24:16 as ulemta and b'tultah [Aramaic for young girl and virgin]. \n \n http://www.thechristianrabbi.org/themiraculousbirth.htm\n \n Now, the Hebrew word \"almah\" is used in the Old Testament a number of times, and it is evident that when this word is used, in context it always refers to a virgin. For instance, in Genesis 24:16, when Abraham's servant went to Haran in search of a bride for Isaac, the verse says, \"And the damsel was fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her..\" The word \"damsel\" is the Hebrew word \"naarah,\" meaning \"young woman.\" But that she was a virgin was also clearly stated, for in Genesis 24:43 it reads, \"Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass that when the virgin comes forth to draw water....\" Here, the Hebrew word for virgin is our word, \"almah.\" This same lady Rebekah, who was a young woman, had never intimately \"known\" any man. Therefore, she was also referred to as a virgin (\"almah\"). \"Almah,\" therefore, must refer to a young woman who is also a virgin. \n \n Now, regarding your \"betulah\" always meaning virgin: Seems to me King Xerxes slept with your betulah's in Esther chapter 2, and they were still called \"betulah's\" even after shacking up with the king.\n \n In addition, out of the fifty or so times the word betulah occurs in the Tanakh, the NJPSV traslates it as maiden 31 times, so you have the same situation with betulah that you rant against with almah. Moreso, a betulah can be fifty or sixty years old, so you can't use that word in describing a young virgin maiden and not have it be ambiguous.\n \n So, you're busted, Trebor (and Orion also)!",

But since a cornerstone of Christian theology is that Christ was sinless, he had to have not had a sinful father.\n \n I'm sure your next question will be, 'but why couldn't he have gotten the sin nature from the mother?' Well, Catholics solve this by saying that Mary too was sinless (Immaculate Conception). Protestants often deal with it by the idea that sin is passed down only from the father of a child, and that Adam of course was the first human father. Neither view is anywhere near airtight.\n \n I tend to view these theological ideas as sort of like parables to represent things like evil in mankind and so forth. IOW, I think the idea of the fall in the Bible is to illustrate man's evil (which is obviously real . . . e.g. Hitler). It's not there to be science or a study of genetics.\n \n Another idea for the purpose of Christ coming via virgin birth was to simply set Jesus apart as divine to contemporaries of his time.

The virgin birth (no sex), the purity of Mary (no original sin), and the birth of Christ are all interlinked doctrines - all of a piece. Sex is still one of the great taboos in Christianity. Simply look at the issue of females in the priesthood or of celibacy or homosexuality. The ancient taboos influence the doctrines and the doctrines give energy to the taboos.\n \n To address your ideas, you have to trace back the Jewish teachings on purity and impurity, then how they affected early and later Christian thinking such as influential theologian St. Augustine (who had serious issues with women and sex).",
