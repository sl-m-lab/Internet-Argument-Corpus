   "People are rarely talking about the same thing on this forum. To stop this bickering let's make our views more clear by giving hypothetical (possibly ridiculously hypothetical) situations that would make you change your views. \n \n Please note we have traveled so deep into hypothetical territory that you can just assume God does not or does not exist. \n \n Here are some hypothetical situations where I would change my views. \n \n 1)I would need God to show enough people working on evolution were doing so to try and give them an excuse to sin to significantly twist results. \n \n 2)Or god to enlarge my brain, show me many different ways of creating universes, many of which had the same sort evidence of common ancestors\n as our own. Then god would have to show how the assumption of common ancestors actually does more harm than good when it comes to explaining that particular universe.",
