   "It seems to me that there's a divide between Creationists and materialists...(well lots of them, actually). But materialists/atheists seem to think that science and religion belong in separate categories...that religion (which concerns itself with the moral and spiritual) and science (which is mostly about observations/theories on about the material world) should not be discussed in the same setting. They simply don't like Christians weaving God, spirituality, morals, or anything non-materialistic into science. That's why anytime a Christian points to any evidence such as the power of prayer, the mind, the mind/body connection, the placebo effect, consciousness, mental abilities, spirituality, or any other trait that cannot be explained materialistically, it's quickly asserted that these are not \"science.\"\n \n But see that's exactly what the divide is. I think the same God who who created the material world is the same God who created the mental and spiritual world. .\n \n And the thing that materialists really hate is the concept of miracles....they hate the concept that something real could be beyond the power of their beloved laws of physics and chemistry. This seems to be the thing that really separates Christians from materialists - Christians readily, accept - even revel in - the notion that Jesus died on the cross and rose in 3 days....we revel in the fact that Christ made a return and was seen by his disciples and hundreds more after his death. We revel in the fact that Jesus turned water into wine and glowed a glorious bright, white light up on the mountain. Etc etc...\n \n And while these are miraculous-sounding, what if they aren't really miracles per se?? Oh, I think they were derived directly from God, but I wonder if they weren't really \"miracles,\" as we humans (who don't hold all the answers to life) would define them. \n \n So what exactly is a\"miracle?\" To me, it seems the way a \"miracle\" is often used might be incorrect. It seems the typical connotation of a miracle is a description of an event that violates the laws of physics and chemistry....and this \"violation\" would require the intervention of some sort of mysterious external force who was not subject to these laws. But I don't know that the Bible defines miracles like that.....or even that it defines them at all, actually. \n \n In fact, could it be that the typical definition of a miracle (a violation of physical laws) could be a cleverly-constructed tactic by atheists? Many of these people will do anything in their power to sway people from the truth of the Resurection.....and Satan knows that many people simply could never accept that natural laws could be violated. In fact, if one accepts that so-called \"physical laws\" are never broken, then by definition, \"miracles\" are impossible. It seems to me that this could be a very clever trick that plays on people's reason and logic.\n \n But miracles are most certainly unlikely, stunning, amazing, and even supernaturally originated....but that does not mean they necessarily break any physical laws! For example, if the flood occurred from the breaking apart of the earth's mantel, which sprewed water in the air, thus flooding the earth - is that a \"miracle?\" Or, if it just simply rained for 40 days and nights?...unusual, but not miraculous. How about if there was an eclipse on the day that Christ died on the cross....is that a miracle? Maybe....maybe not. How about a rainbow - God gave that to us as a reminder that He would never destroy the earth again with water - is that a miracle?\n \n Of course, it all gets trickier when, for intance, Jesus rises from the dead. But to further my point here, let me make a quick analogy:\n \n In Richard Dawkins' book \"The Blind Watchmaker\" (pg. 249) Dawkins explains why Darwin's theory of evolution is important. First he Quotes Darwin:\n \n If I were convinced that I required such additions to the theory of natural selection, I would reject it as rubbish...I would give nothing for the theory of Natural selection, if it requires miraculous additions at any one stage of descent.\n \n To that Dawkins says this:\n \n This is no petty matter. In Darwin's view, the whole point of the theory of evolution by natural selection was that it provided a non-miraculous account of the existence of comlex adaptations. For what it's worth, it is also the point of this book.\n \n In his book, Dawkins seems a bit nervous of Lamarck's theory. He even spends a whole chapter talking about alternative versions of evolution. But my point is that Dawkins is essentially equating non-selectionist/Lamarckism (ie..environmentally-induced, internally-driven, heritable changes) to MIRACLES!\n \n But are they really miracles?...or are these changes that stem from mental processes simply unknown and undefinable?????? If this indeed is how life changes, no one could really point to what or where these adaptations originated....oh, one might say the \"mind\"....but what the heck is that?...that certainly has no concrete understanding.\n \n But I don't think God has to act contrary to His own personal creation. The spiritual world and the material world are His doing, and God is unchanging....his will is forever and also never changes. So even though Jesus rose from the dead, there may be a perfect natural, logical explanation!...we just don't know what it is yet.\n \n The way I see it, though fully human, Jesus must have known of and was able to tap into another reality that we don't know about yet....a reality where matter and energy can be changed and manipulated at will.....and this could only happen if matter and energy were interchangeable.\n \n It seems to me that the human body is like a tree, with the God-given spirit, an internal energy being the root - and the physcal body being the braches. This is the only explanation as to how the mental can modify the physical -- if energy and mass are essentially the same. I think it's quite possible that Jesus was able to rise from the dead by converting energy to mass, which sure enough would be \"miraculous,\" but yet, breaking no laws:\n \n http://www.geraldschroeder.com/existence.html\n \n It took humanity millennia before an Einstein discovered that, as bizarre as it may seem, matter is actually condensed energy. It may take a while longer for us to discover that there is some non-thing even more fundamental than energy that forms the basis of energy. In the words of John Archibald Wheeler, the renowned former president of the American Physical Society, recipient of the Einstein Award and Princeton professor of physics, underlying all existence is an idea, the \"bit\" of information that gives rise to the \"it\" of matter. \n \n The substructure of all existence, we suddenly realize, is totally ethereal, an idea, wisdom. Or in Hebrew emet - an all encompassing reality. Emet is the ultimate building block from which all we see and feel is constructed. Just as the secondary substructure of all matter is something as ethereal as energy, as per Einstein's fantastic insight, so, the primary substructure of energy is still more elusive. Existence is the expression of an idea, an eternal consciousness made tangible. We are the idea of God. ",

   "Whilst I belive miracles can happen, and I define a miracle as something that can't be explained yet, or possibly even ever.\n What Charlies says is correct.\n Miraculous healing IS NOT confined to Christian prayer. Actually, I've spent considerable time investigating this on a laymans level and the most common denominator is the patients own outlook on life. \n Those of Shinto, Jewish of Christian faiths can be healed 'miraculously' equally.\n \n As for personal testimoney. Upon investigation, most cases are proven to be false. There is no evidence of an illness of infirmity even EVER existing in some cases. In others, whilst the patient claims up and down to feel better, they aren't. Merely hyped up on endorphins that they get from their often, over emotional, religious ceremonies.\n Religion now a days is very emotionally driven. In a manipulatory manner, such mesmerissm often lasts 3-4 days. Thus, after this period of time, the patient will start felling pretty sickly again Unless they get another influx. This helps to explain why many such people go to church 2-3 times a week. Sunday's and Wednesdays being common. So they can be hyped up again.\n \n Many faith healers have no abilities whatso ever. Most twisting scripture to suit their own ends. When there is no healing, they now blame the patient for lack of faith or for having unconfessed sin.\n Some notible scammers will not even see the really sick in person, keeping them in the back of the 'church' whilst those thousands healing are ushered in rented wheel chairs to the front and healed (of relatively shall problems or of problems that don't even exist). \n A reviewe of youtube will show clips from shows such as 20/20 and 60 Minutes where such frauds are revealed.\n \n As Charlie states, prayer actually healing anyone is pure coincidental. Heck, prayer doing anything other than falsly comforting the speaker is incidental. Not much power from your god there if all that happens is the equivelent of random chance. My lack of prayer has kept me healthier, wealthier and wiser than ALL of those I've ever met who do pray combined. Should we use that as an example of the power of lack of prayer?\n \n In the end, it's pretty close to a faulty cause and effect based on pure ignorance of psychology. There is more often than not, NO healing taking place. Just a belief that it did. of those actually healed, evidence supports that Christianity is NOT the cause of that healing.\n \n Next thing you know, you'll be stating Jesus power gives you strength to tear phones books in two and can protect you whilst you walk on hot coals.",

I think Jesus' statement \"O, ye of little faith\" was quite telling. In the Bible it says that God is the alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end -- that all live in Him and through Him.\n \n Think about that. If that is true -- (which I know virtually no one here believes besides me and a couple others).....but if that is true then everything goes through Him. That means we are living in Him...(which I admit is a mind-bender). But by simply living in Him, then miraculous things are possible. Of course these \"miracles\" must be confined to the limits of the laws God set up. God is the only One who is outside these laws....He was the only One around before the creation of the world, and He is the only one capable of skirting these laws.\n \n But there may be \"miracles\" going on all the time....yet many just don't know it or admit it. For example, take the placebo effect.....let's say I have a disease, and then lets say I take what I think is a proven medication that will cure me...but then it turns out that the pill I took was just a sugar pill, yet I quickly healed anyway. This seems to me to be somewhat miraculous. Is it supernatural? Probably not. But the idea that my thoughts and beliefs can cure a physical disease borerlines on the unexplainable.

Science is a methodology for investigating phenomena, not an enumeration of them. So it is perfectly possible to scientifically investigate, say, the power of prayer. \n \n Consider for a moment what you actually mean by 'materialistically': what is it that defines something as being material? Gravity is every bit as intangible as a miracle, yet you would automatically characterise it as being part of the material world. Why? The answer is that it is amenable to the scientific method: assertions about gravity can be repeatably tested. If ghosts and poltergeists were amenable to the same methodology, it would be possible to construct scientific theories concerning those, too, and they would be considered no more exotic or 'supernatural' than clouds or rainbows.\n \n When you get your head around that, it's immediately apparent that it isn't the power of prayer or spirituality per se that aren't scientific, it's the methodology people have for dealing with them. Indeed, when the scientific method is applied and doesn't yield the results believers in such matters want, the typical response is to come up with excuses why we shouldn't expect the scientific method to work. Unfortunately you can't have it both ways; if you want to come to the party you have to adopt the dress code.\n \n Really, none of this would be a problem if science didn't have a (from a religious perspective) nasty habit of finding explanations for, or hidden and unexpected complexities within, features of the material world about which religious texts or leaders had already made firm pronouncements. Because despite the fact that you, SS, and others see science and evolution as an enemy of your philosophy and spirituality, the actual bone of contention is always in the material world. So who's really treading on whose toes here? It's your choice to shackle your spirituality to a particular - and demonstrably wrong - version of material events, SS, not mine.\n \n \nAnd the thing that materialists really hate is the concept of miracles....they hate the concept that something real could be beyond the power of their beloved laws of physics and chemistry. This seems to be the thing that really separates Christians from materialists - Christians readily, accept - even revel in - the notion that Jesus died on the cross and rose in 3 days....we revel in the fact that Christ made a return and was seen by his disciples and hundreds more after his death. We revel in the fact that Jesus turned water into wine and glowed a glorious bright, white light up on the mountain. Etc etc...\n\n \n You revel in those beliefs, certainly - and not surprising either. All these miracles, and others, embody the personally comforting notion that for special people, the universe makes exceptions. This is a common feature of religions, from the oldest to the newest, ever since we were first intelligent enough to appreciate at a conscious level that there were things in the world we didn't understand and couldn't control and which didn't seem to care very much about us, like lightning or crocodiles. \n \n As members of a species who have evolved the habit of ingratiating ourselves with other, more powerful members by making the right sounds and employing properly deferential body language, the idea of being able to employ the same techniques to get the uncaring forces of nature on your side is a powerfully seductive one. Certainly it's more palatable than believing that sometimes the crocodile is already full when you happen to take a dip, and sometimes it is not.\n \n Gotta go, back later.",

   "SS - your implication is that if Christians testify to the efficasy of prayer, then the result is God-derived. If not, why use the word prayer?\n \n Across the human species, we can all use inner strength to fight e.g. illness: Christians and non-Christians alike will have varying degrees of success. That is certainly not evidence that if a Christian prays, that it was a Supreme Being causing a beneficial result.\n \n \n Correct. A human construct. What YOU want it to be, not what God wants it to be. That's why there are so many flavours of religion. Your mind tells YOU what is convenient and plausible for YOU. And from there you argue that that is proof of the existence of God because you can feel it in mind, soul and body.\n \n Such is the folly of wanting and believing. Think outside the box.\n\n \n So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ? \n \n So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.\n \n Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.\n \n But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.\n \n This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, \"Lord Jesus, help me\". Nothing I did stopped the attack, nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes. I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy.

The illusion of causality, with or without a proposed divine intermediary, arises from the fact that a religious person will often pray for others, and others will often get better, making it likely that the one will precede the other.\n \n *Unless they know they're being prayed for, in which case they sometimes do better, or occasionally worse than normal, stressing out because they think the fact that people are praying for them means they must be in pretty dire straights.\n \n \nSo when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ?\n\n \n Nope, I think what's being said is that it was a coincidence. Lots of babies have fevers, lots of parents, in the extremis of worry, pray for them to get better. Usually, they do. Sometimes it happens after lots of prayer, sometimes after just one. Often it happens without any prayer. When prayers don't coincide with recovery people either lose faith or rationalise away the failure of the prayer by saying it wasn't in line with god's plan. When prayers do coincide with recovery, especially very closely, a person's faith can be strongly - if quite accidentally - reinforced.\n \n It's tempting to scoff at 'coincidence' as being a non-explanation, because from an individual perspective it seems like the one life you lead is very unlikely to contain events that are individually very unlikely in themselves. However, with enough people, the odds of something unlikely happening to at least one of them can be very high indeed - hence lotteries have winners despite the odds. The natural response is to say 'yeah, but the odds of that person being me are very low' to which the only answer that matters is \"Yes, but the winner could say exactly the same thing.\" \n \n Consider for a moment: from your point of view as a conscious individual you experienced miracles, and here you are telling people about them. But from my point of view, you're just the lottery winner. If I wasn't having this conversation with you, I would be having it with the guy who did win, while you mowed the lawn or read a Richard Dawkins book.\n \n The point is not that I disbelieve what happened to you, or think that you should interpret it differently (so long as your beliefs make you happy and don't inspire you or anyone else to take silly risks on the assumption that god will intervene). The point is that that you're conducting false advertising. You're saying that prayer can influence the chances of good things happening to you or someone else, or bad things not happening to you or someone else, and there's no evidence of that whatsoever.\n \n Why isn't your personal experience evidence? I know that probably bugs you most of all, me sitting here smugly discounting what you know to be true. The reason I discount it is that if you were right, and we could alter the chances of events happening through prayer, then we should be able to see that pattern emerge across lots of people, not just individuals. If prayer can help someone recover from illness, then we should logically see those who are prayed for recovering more often and more readily - we don't. How do you explain that? How can prayers heal this individual and that individual, yet make no difference to the proportion who are healed overall?\n \n \nNow mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me.\n\n \n The rational response is to believe your daughter healed herself - that's what her immune system does.\n \n \nAnd I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.\n\n \n And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone to whom an powerfully emotionally charged coincidence has occurred to avoid having that colour his worldview to the point where he attributes progressively less remarkable 'miracles' to the same supernatural force. \n \n So you didn't merely 'not drown', you were supernaturally saved from drowning. Your would-be assailants didn't see something real behind you that was gone when you turned around, they saw a manifestation of your guardian angel invoked by the prayer you uttered as they approached. The fact that you now enter any stressful situation armed with a prayer makes it impossible for you to experience success and not attribute it to the efficacy of your whispered words.\n \n I've had my fair share of close calls too. I've missed seeing a stop sign in the dark (the road ahead banked upward and the sign was above the reach of my headlights) and shot straight across a packed two-lane highway in the middle of rush hour, into - not a brick wall, or even another road, but a gated car park whose entrance just happened to be opposite and whose gate just happened to be raised at the time. Had things been slightly different, I'd be dead now. Miraculous? No. When I said 'fair share', I meant exactly that. The person to whom nothing remotely remarkable happens is himself a statistical phenomenon.\n \n Had you drowned, you would not be here saying it was a miracle - but someone would be, relating a similar story of miraculous survival which your silent voice would be unable to debunk. And if - perish the thought - your daughter had not recovered from her illness, you would not be here describing that miraculous event - but someone would be, telling a similar tale of faith-healing, using their words to convince others of something you in your grief would know was untrue. It just so happens that thanks to the happy accidents that have occurred in your life, you are that someone, while it is left to others to drown alone with their prayers unanswered, or to rationalise away their rage against an indifferent god by their daughter's graveside.",

The illusion of causality, with or without a proposed divine intermediary, arises from the fact that a religious person will often pray for others, and others will often get better, making it likely that the one will precede the other.\n \n *Unless they know they're being prayed for, in which case they sometimes do better, or occasionally worse than normal, stressing out because they think the fact that people are praying for them means they must be in pretty dire straights.\n \n \n \n Nope, I think what's being said is that it was a coincidence. Lots of babies have fevers, lots of parents, in the extremis of worry, pray for them to get better. Usually, they do. Sometimes it happens after lots of prayer, sometimes after just one. Often it happens without any prayer. When prayers don't coincide with recovery people either lose faith or rationalise away the failure of the prayer by saying it wasn't in line with god's plan. When prayers do coincide with recovery, especially very closely, a person's faith can be strongly - if quite accidentally - reinforced.\n \n It's tempting to scoff at 'coincidence' as being a non-explanation, because from an individual perspective it seems like the one life you lead is very unlikely to contain events that are individually very unlikely in themselves. However, with enough people, the odds of something unlikely happening to at least one of them can be very high indeed - hence lotteries have winners despite the odds. The natural response is to say 'yeah, but the odds of that person being me are very low' to which the only answer that matters is \"Yes, but the winner could say exactly the same thing.\" \n \n Consider for a moment: from your point of view as a conscious individual you experienced miracles, and here you are telling people about them. But from my point of view, you're just the lottery winner. If I wasn't having this conversation with you, I would be having it with the guy who did win, while you mowed the lawn or read a Richard Dawkins book.\n \n The point is not that I disbelieve what happened to you, or think that you should interpret it differently (so long as your beliefs make you happy and don't inspire you or anyone else to take silly risks on the assumption that god will intervene). The point is that that you're conducting false advertising. You're saying that prayer can influence the chances of good things happening to you or someone else, or bad things not happening to you or someone else, and there's no evidence of that whatsoever.\n \n Why isn't your personal experience evidence? I know that probably bugs you most of all, me sitting here smugly discounting what you know to be true. The reason I discount it is that if you were right, and we could alter the chances of events happening through prayer, then we should be able to see that pattern emerge across lots of people, not just individuals. If prayer can help someone recover from illness, then we should logically see those who are prayed for recovering more often and more readily - we don't. How do you explain that? How can prayers heal this individual and that individual, yet make no difference to the proportion who are healed overall?\n \n \n \n The rational response is to believe your daughter healed herself - that's what her immune system does.\n \n \n \n And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone to whom an powerfully emotionally charged coincidence has occurred to avoid having that colour his worldview to the point where he attributes progressively less remarkable 'miracles' to the same supernatural force. \n \n So you didn't merely 'not drown', you were supernaturally saved from drowning. Your would-be assailants didn't see something real behind you that was gone when you turned around, they saw a manifestation of your guardian angel invoked by the prayer you uttered as they approached. The fact that you now enter any stressful situation armed with a prayer makes it impossible for you to experience success and not attribute it to the efficacy of your whispered words.\n \n I've had my fair share of close calls too. I've missed seeing a stop sign in the dark (the road ahead banked upward and the sign was above the reach of my headlights) and shot straight across a packed two-lane highway in the middle of rush hour, into - not a brick wall, or even another road, but a gated car park whose entrance just happened to be opposite and whose gate just happened to be raised at the time. Had things been slightly different, I'd be dead now. Miraculous? No. When I said 'fair share', I meant exactly that. The person to whom nothing remotely remarkable happens is himself a statistical phenomenon.\n \n Had you drowned, you would not be here saying it was a miracle - but someone would be, relating a similar story of miraculous survival which your silent voice would be unable to debunk. And if - perish the thought - your daughter had not recovered from her illness, you would not be here describing that miraculous event - but someone would be, telling a similar tale of faith-healing, using their words to convince others of something you in your grief would know was untrue. It just so happens that thanks to the happy accidents that have occurred in your life, you are that someone, while it is left to others to drown alone with their prayers unanswered, or to rationalise away their rage against an indifferent god by their daughter's graveside.\n\n \n Just out of curiosity, what do you think scared those attackers off when the last thing that one guy said to me was, the next time I'll kill you ? Why would he rush off with a look of terror in his eyes if he had no immediate interuption preventing him from killing me then ? And I marvel at how someone who wasn't even there can so confidently explain what happened to me were self delusions of convenience and I so enjoyed them that I choose to delude myself all the time now. Kind of like, I deluded myself once and it felt so good I do it all the time now. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n How about this one. I was 17 years old and staying at the Travel Lodge on W-42nd St. in New York City in 1970. That was hooker row and remember, I didn't accept Jesus for another 5 years at 22 yrs old. It was 1:30 AM in one of the most dangerous parts of the City at the time and I decide to take a walk. I determined to NOT go into any strip clubs, bars to drink or to try to pick up any hookers because I did know this was a dangerous part of town.\n \n So dressed like a preppie from a small town with my chino pants, button down shirt with a beige fur lined overcoat and penny loafers I went for my walk sticking out like a sheep in a den of wolves dressed like that. What happened next was the strangest experience to have ever happened in my life up until that point, and only when I accepted Jesus did the Holy Spirit bring this time back to my memory and confirm for me what happened that night. I must have past 75 to a hundred people walking the other direction as I headed up 42nd st., took a right, then a left and went down the next street parralel to 42nd. But here was the miracle. Maybe 5 or 10 of the people I passed while on that walk actually looked and even saw me. The rest of them were walking right towards me, but strangely, they made very wide archs or loops around me. As if they couldn't walk past me because there was an obstacle on either side of the that prevented them from getting close enough to just walk past me like we all walk past each other every day of our lives on the street.\n \n And that's not all. They all were looking up to my left or right way above my head, like 8 to 10 feet high, but they didn't even take notice of me at all. It became so obvious to me that girls dressed as working hookers weren't even noticing me as they stared up to my left or right that I too looked up to my left and right to see what everyone was looking at. Guess what I saw ? That's right, nothing at all. To me I was alone. But every one who walked toward me except for the few I mentioned never even noticed me but stared up and to my left or right. Finally, I saw a hooker coming toward me and determined that I'm going to get this girls attention if it's the last thing I do. As she got within 10 feet of me I said loudly, HI, HOW AR YOU TONIGHT! She never even noticed me. And for a good looking kid this was beyond my comprehension as I had never experienced being invisible to any girls in my life to that point. \n \n When I got back to my Hotel Room, I turned on the Radio in the TV as I got ready for bed and heard a lot of Police Sirens rush by the Hotel. A few minutes later a report came on the radio that a shooting murder had taken place in the area and police were responding. What I realized years later from the Holy Spirit was that anyone who meant me harm or negative attention of any kind, saw my Angels which explained why they made such a wide loop around me. Those who didn't mean me any harm, saw me and only me. Weird huh ? But absolutely true. And you can give any explanation you like to de-mystify it as a supernatural Angelic Intervention meant to protect me till the day of my salvation, but you will be wrong as it was as simple and incredible as I explained it to be.",

Its thought by some that this has to do with preventing uncontrolled growth - like cancers. \n \n Its not a miracle by the way - the process is fairly well understood in species which exhibit it routinely. More or less its a replay of the original developmental program. And of course we know that even mammals are able to replay the ENTIRE developmental program from scratch. The fact that mice can be cloned is positive evidence of this. \n \n WIKI has this to say among other things:\n \n \nRegeneration occurs in many, if not all vertebrate embryos, and is present in some adult animals such as salamanders ( e.g. [1]). Mammals exhibit limited regenerative abilities, although not as impressive as salamanders. Examples of mammalian regeneration include antlers, finger tips and holes in ears. Finger tip regeneration has been well characterized, and these studies have resulted in the first demonstration of a genetic pathway controlling regeneration in a mammal. Several species of mammals can regenerate ear holes; a phenomenon that has been most studied in the MRL mouse. If the processes behind regeneration are fully understood, it is believed this would lead to better treatment for individuals with nerve injuries (such as those resulting from a broken back or a polio infection), missing limbs, and/or damaged or destroyed organs.\n \n Regeneration of a lost limb occurs in two major steps, first de-differentiation of adult cells into a stem cell state similar to embryonic cells and second, development of these cells into new tissue more or less the same way it developed the first time [7]. Some animals like planarians instead keep clusters of non-differentiated cells within their bodies, which migrate to the parts of the body that need healing. newt and axolotl), hydra, horseshoe crabs and a type of mouse.\n \n \n",

It seems that limb regeneration is some pretty incredible evidence of intelligent design to me.[/quote]\n Sorry, what? I'm not following your logic?\n \n Traits that are advantageous in terms of leading to more offspring get passed on, and those that don't pay for themselves in terms of leading to more offspring are likely to be lost. In the case of regeneration, it would be of obvious benefit to us, but the ability was lost way back in early mammals. I'd speculate (not being an expert on this) that loss of regeneration stems from mammals requiring much more food much more frequently than reptiles and amphibians. First, mammals gave up indeterminate growth in order to enjoy the benefits of speed, hard bony joints, and occluding teeth with respect to getting more food, and that may well have required giving up regeneration. Second, because mammals need so much food, the loss of a leg would likely prove fatal in mammals well before its use was regained, so regeneration need not have been that helpful, and its loss was not selectively important.\n \n Note that evolution does not result in perfection: it results in 'good enough'.

When we apply these techniques to gravity, they all yield propagation speeds too great to measure, substantially faster than light-speed. This is because gravity, in contrast to light, has no detectable aberration or propagation delay for its action, even for cases (such as binary pulsars) where sources of gravity accelerate significantly during the light time from source to target.\n \n Near the end of his career, Lorentz is quoted as having graciously conceded the contest: \"My theory can obtain all the same results as special relativity, but perhaps not with a comparable simplicity\" (private communication from C.O. Alley). Today, with hindsight, we might make a somewhat different assessment: \"Special Relativity can explain all the experimental results in Table H that Lorentzian Relativity can, but perhaps not with a comparable simplicity.\" Even so, SR cannot explain the faster-than-light propagation of gravity, although LR readily can.\n \n We conclude that the speed of gravity may provide the new insight physics has been awaiting to lead the way to unification of the fundamental forces. As shown in Van Flandern, 1993, pp.80-85 and Van Flandern, 1996, it may also be connected with the explanation of the dark matter problem in cosmology. Moreover, the modest switch from SR to LR may correct the \"wrong turn\" physics must have made to get into the dilemma presented by quantum mechanics, that there appears to be no \"deep reality\" to the world around us. Quantum phenomena that violate the locality criterion may now be welcomed into conventional physics.\n \n you're all talk and no brains.",

The findings hint at one way that life could have gotten started on Earth, and even the incredible although remote possibility that life--and perhaps intelligence--could exist among the interstellar clouds of outer space.\n \n Conventional wisdom says life in the universe requires carbon and liquid water. With these two simple necessities, life has crept into just about every nook and cranny on Earth, from the scalding waters of deep ocean vents to the underside of Antarctica's icy rocks. As a consequence, scientists looking for extraterrestrial life have based all of their searches and instruments on the existence of carbon and--on Mars, for example--on minerals that only could have formed in the presence of water.\n \n Now comes the prospect that life might be able to evolve in an astoundingly simple fashion. Reporting online in today's issue of the New Journal of Physics, a team from Russia, Germany, and Australia details how computer simulations of molecular dynamics can produce conditions under which evolution appears to begin spontaneously. In their simulations, free-floating molecules begin organizing into a helixlike structure resembling DNA, and as time passes, more stable molecular arrangements begin replacing less-stable versions. The process proceeds, the authors say, because an electrical property called polarization tends to organize the particles and reduce chaos, much like tuning a radio to the proper frequency can produce clear audio from the static. The findings are particularly intriguing, they say, because molecular clouds are common across the universe, such as in vast zones of dust among the stars of the Milky Way.\n \n The research is sound and it suggests \"a mechanism whereby organic matter could assemble faster than in previous models,\" says plasma physicist Mark Koepke of West Virginia University in Morgantown. The shorter time could mean a greater probability that conventional life exists elsewhere in the universe, he says.\n \n However, astrobiologist Margaret Turnbull of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, cautions against underestimating the critical role that water plays in life. Water is \"so fabulous for life\" because it shields organic molecules \"from the electrical charges that would normally drive them apart.\" Although the researchers may indeed have found another medium within which complex molecules can interact in sophisticated ways, Turnbull says, it remains to be seen whether the right conditions exist in space for these structures to become \"complex enough to seed life on young planets.\"",

   "Speed of Gravity - empirically measured.\n \n ====================================\n \n The speed of gravity can be calculated from observations of the orbital decay rate of binary pulsars PSR 1913+16 and PSR B1534+12. The orbits of these pulsars around each other is decaying due to loss of energy in the form of gravitational radiation. The rate of this energy loss (\"gravitational damping\") can be measured, and since it depends on the speed of gravity, comparing the measured values to theory shows that the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light to within 1%. [11] (However, it should be noted that measuring the speed of gravity by comparing theoretical results with experimental results will depend on the theory; use of a theory other than that of general relativity could in principle show a different speed, although the existence of gravitational damping at all implies that the speed cannot be infinite.)\n \n In September 2002, Sergei Kopeikin and Edward Fomalont announced that they had made an indirect measurement of the speed of gravity, using their data from VLBI measurement of the retarded position of Jupiter on its orbit during Jupiter's transit across the line-of-sight of the bright radio source quasar QSO J0842+1835. Kopeikin and Fomalont concluded that the speed of gravity is between 0.8 and 1.2 times the speed of light, which would be fully consistent with the theoretical prediction of general relativity that the speed of gravity is exactly the same as the speed of light.\n \n Several physicists, including Clifford M. Will and Steve Carlip, have criticized these claims on the grounds that they have allegedly misinterpreted the results of their measurements. However, Kopeikin and Fomalont continue to vigorously argue their case. (See the citations below for the details of the arguments pro and con.)\n \n It is important to understand that none of the participants in this controversy are claiming that general relativity is \"wrong\". Rather, the debate concerns whether or not Kopeikin and Fomalont have really provided yet another verification of one of its fundamental predictions.",

   "http://www.gravitywarpdrive.com/Speed_of_Gravity.htm\n \n Standard experimental techniques exist to determine the propagation speed of forces. When we apply these techniques to gravity, they all yield propagation speeds too great to measure, substantially faster than light-speed. This is because gravity, in contrast to light, has no detectable aberration or propagation delay for its action, even for cases (such as binary pulsars) where sources of gravity accelerate significantly during the light time from source to target.\n \n Near the end of his career, Lorentz is quoted as having graciously conceded the contest: \"My theory can obtain all the same results as special relativity, but perhaps not with a comparable simplicity\" (private communication from C.O. Alley). Today, with hindsight, we might make a somewhat different assessment: \"Special Relativity can explain all the experimental results in Table H that Lorentzian Relativity can, but perhaps not with a comparable simplicity.\" Even so, SR cannot explain the faster-than-light propagation of gravity, although LR readily can.\n \n We conclude that the speed of gravity may provide the new insight physics has been awaiting to lead the way to unification of the fundamental forces. As shown in Van Flandern, 1993, pp.80-85 and Van Flandern, 1996, it may also be connected with the explanation of the dark matter problem in cosmology. Moreover, the modest switch from SR to LR may correct the \"wrong turn\" physics must have made to get into the dilemma presented by quantum mechanics, that there appears to be no \"deep reality\" to the world around us. Quantum phenomena that violate the locality criterion may now be welcomed into conventional physics.\n \n you're all talk and no brains.\n\n \n Nary a word on how gravity is instantaneous (which is what I brought to debate).\n \n Now who is it without the brains? hmmm. emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Really, SS, you aren't worth my time - byebye!",

   "Just out of curiosity, what do you think scared those attackers off when the last thing that one guy said to me was, the next time I'll kill you ? Why would he rush off with a look of terror in his eyes if he had no immediate interuption preventing him from killing me then ? \n <snip<\n When I got back to my Hotel Room, I turned on the Radio in the TV as I got ready for bed and heard a lot of Police Sirens rush by the Hotel. A few minutes later a report came on the radio that a shooting murder had taken place in the area and police were responding. What I realized years later from the Holy Spirit was that anyone who meant me harm or negative attention of any kind, saw my Angels which explained why they made such a wide loop around me. Those who didn't mean me any harm, saw me and only me. Weird huh ? But absolutely true. And you can give any explanation you like to de-mystify it as a supernatural Angelic Intervention meant to protect me till the day of my salvation, but you will be wrong as it was as simple and incredible as I explained it to be.\n\n \n You seem to be under the impression that I'm obliged to produce an alternative explanation for your personal experiences - or rather, the version of your interpretation of your personal experiences you're relating here - in order for me to be right about prayers making no statistical difference. I do not.\n \n What I do have is an explanation for the discrepancy - you don't like it very much, but that's OK, you don't have to. That explanation is that prayer doesn't actually work, and you are merely cherry-picking unusual and memorable events from your life and assigning a supernatural bent to them. As you managed to put it more concisely than I was able to: \"I deluded myself once and it felt so good I do it all the time now.\" I can totally sympathise; I was the same with masturbation.\n \n You, on the other hand, have no explanation for the discrepancy between your unshakeable belief that prayer works and the empirical fact that it makes no detectable difference. Your only response is to become irritated with those who point it out, and loudly declare your intention to remain unmoved by it.\n \n I'm happy your daughter recovered, but I find your take on it pretty darn twisted, frankly. You believe in an omniscient god, yet it took a prayer from you to draw his attention to a sick baby. Or was Jesus waiting to see if you prayed or not before letting her continue to suffer, or even die? If we are all part of god's plan, then presumably his plan was for her to die until you changed his mind. Can you change the mind of god? Persuade him that his plan is not the best one possible? If not, then his plan was for her to recover anyway. If so - wow, how important must you be, to have your prayers answered while others' are not!\n \n In fact, given that recovery rates are identical for those who are prayed for and those who are not, your quickly-answered prayer must have condemned some other child to die. And not the child of a non-believer, either, because that would skew the statistics in favour of the devout. No: you must just have prayed better than someone else. Well done - although I'm not sure persuading god to favour you over someone else is really the Christian thing to do.\n \n None of it makes sense, Archangel; it doesn't stand up to the slightest critical scrutiny. You profess to be humble - well then, be humble and echo Kurt Vonnegut's words: \"I was a victim of a series of accidents, as are we all.\" To say anything else is to elevate yourself above others in the eyes of the only person you think matters: god.",

   "How about this one. I was 17 years old and staying at the Travel Lodge on W-42nd St. in New York City in 1970. That was hooker row and remember, I didn't accept Jesus for another 5 years at 22 yrs old. It was 1:30 AM in one of the most dangerous parts of the City at the time and I decide to take a walk. I determined to NOT go into any strip clubs, bars to drink or to try to pick up any hookers because I did know this was a dangerous part of town.\n \n So dressed like a preppie from a small town with my chino pants, button down shirt with a beige fur lined overcoat and penny loafers I went for my walk sticking out like a sheep in a den of wolves dressed like that. What happened next was the strangest experience to have ever happened in my life up until that point, and only when I accepted Jesus did the Holy Spirit bring this time back to my memory and confirm for me what happened that night. I must have past 75 to a hundred people walking the other direction as I headed up 42nd st., took a right, then a left and went down the next street parralel to 42nd. But here was the miracle. Maybe 5 or 10 of the people I passed while on that walk actually looked and even saw me. The rest of them were walking right towards me, but strangely, they made very wide archs or loops around me. As if they couldn't walk past me because there was an obstacle on either side of the that prevented them from getting close enough to just walk past me like we all walk past each other every day of our lives on the street.\n \n And that's not all. They all were looking up to my left or right way above my head, like 8 to 10 feet high, but they didn't even take notice of me at all. It became so obvious to me that girls dressed as working hookers weren't even noticing me as they stared up to my left or right that I too looked up to my left and right to see what everyone was looking at. Guess what I saw ? That's right, nothing at all. To me I was alone. But every one who walked toward me except for the few I mentioned never even noticed me but stared up and to my left or right. Finally, I saw a hooker coming toward me and determined that I'm going to get this girls attention if it's the last thing I do. As she got within 10 feet of me I said loudly, HI, HOW AR YOU TONIGHT! She never even noticed me. And for a good looking kid this was beyond my comprehension as I had never experienced being invisible to any girls in my life to that point. \n \n When I got back to my Hotel Room, I turned on the Radio in the TV as I got ready for bed and heard a lot of Police Sirens rush by the Hotel. A few minutes later a report came on the radio that a shooting murder had taken place in the area and police were responding.

And you can give any explanation you like to de-mystify it as a supernatural Angelic Intervention meant to protect me till the day of my salvation, but you will be wrong as it was as simple and incredible as I explained it to be.\n\n \n I would have avoided you as well...without the \"angels\". Anyone foolish enough to walk around the west side late at night dressed like a moving target is not someone I want to be next to. You might as well have painted a bullseye on yourself. They were probably not avoiding angels, but rather did not want to be in the line of fire. They were looking around to see which tree or alley your attacker was going to jump out of. The fact that you were not robbed or killed is sheer luck, nothing more. But hey, you call it the way you see it...it's your story. Don't mind the snickering (I know, I know...you're getting used to it). \n \n And let me get this right as well...out of the probalby 75 people you passed, you are saying that 65-70 of them meant you harm?

What remains then is that everything I told you is absolutely true and happened exactly as I said it did. \n \n You would also think that the fact that for 5 years I remembered the strange events of that night but never attributed them to an Angelic intervention until after getting saved and having the Holy Spirit confirm in my mind what had actually happened that night would add credibility to what happened to me. I obviously didn't have any spiritual awareness as I wasn't even born again yet so wasn't even sensitive to the bible, Angels, or that God would intervene to keep me safe for the day of my salvation. That is why it wasn't until I got saved that the Holy Spirit was able to finally answer the question for me about what actually transpired that night 5 years before I was even born again.\n \n These two events aren't the only ones I've had in my life either. If I'm an example then the Angelic forces are very busy keeping the children of God safe for His use and Glory, Amen...

Perhaps you could take a moment to do the same with mine, and answer the question I posed: since the 'tens of millions' of testimonies that prayer works, rather than supporting one another, are all effectively competing for the same handful of potential genuine instances permitted by the margin of error in the statistics, whom am I supposed to believe?\n \n \nAnd feel free to believe as you do but simply put, I know you're as wrong as wrong can be. You see, if prayer doesn't work then God isn't real. \n\n \n This doesn't actually follow. It might be that if prayer doesn't work, then the specific nature of god you believe in isn't correct, but it does not disallow the existence of god in any way.\n \n \nYou are just words on a screen to me. And you prove your shallowness by writing things I know to be lies and shallow deceptions.\n \n \n Perhaps you could point these lies and deceptions out. Am I lying when I say no study has ever demonstrated the efficacy of prayer? Am I being deceptive when I draw logical conclusions from that, or when I ask how you reconcile the apparent contradiction? So far, you have refused to actually speak to the argument I am presenting, and instead merely reiterated your beliefs, over and over, interspersed with insulting comments.\n \n \nBut my God is greater than any human technology and communicates with me moment by moment from within my own heart, mind and soul. His presence is deeper and more personally felt than the relationships I have with the people in this life I know the best and love the most. After all, I'm with them only some of the time, but God, the Holy Spirit dwells within me every moment of every day of my life. I know this is beyond your ability to understand, \n\n \n Once again, your professed humility is revealed to be a conceit. It's worth noting that throughout this discussion you have used every opportunity to insinuate that you are morally, intellectually and spiritually superior:\n \nYou people are beyond pitiful, as is your understanding of simple english I might add. But interpret what I said anyway you like as even attempting to re-explain myself would be an utter and complete waste of my time, because the truth of what God is most assuredly capable of and did is so far beyond your ability to understand or believe anyway.\n\n \nyou people have attempted to shoehorn them into your limited understanding.\n\n \nI guess I'll never learn when it comes to sharing Gods love and grace with unbelievers.\n\n \nLike any false god he too has created false religions that have entrapped complete cultures and peoples into submission to his lies and deceit. That is why it's up to us to seek Gods Truth and if we do God will find us and we will be set free. But if one seeks for a religion they are most comfortable with, one which satisfies their comfort zones and is easy to accept. You can bet that it's a cult and satanic belief system that doesn't free the spirit but enslaves it that has been found by that person.\n\n I invite you to examine my posts in the thread so far. You will find my only criticism has been to highlight your hypocrisy in declaring your humility while rubbing everyone's noses in their supposed inferiority and declaring again and again your elevated status in god's eyes.\n \n The rest of the post is, I think, somewhat beside the point of the discussion.",

Ergo there is no God.\n\n \n You guys seem intent on changing the focus of my experiences from Angelic interventions to being about prayer. Both of my accounts were about Angels intervening to protect me from harm. One of those accounts happening 5 years before I even accepted jesus as my Lord. In the first account I simply said Jesus Help Me within myself before my attackers were scared off by something only they saw, but once they left I was alone and no person showed up at all. Saying Jesus Help Me to myself isn't even a prayer per-se but is reaching out to God in a time of urgent need.",

They have happend to me PERSONALLY. But of course I cannot take you back in time to experience them with me, so I can only tell you how to experience such a reality your self. Which is exactly what I've done in these most recent posts. But you and chemist are obviously either too ignorant to comprehend my words or too intent on demanding that I prove spiritual realities to you with physical evidence over the medium of a computer screen. Either way I'm through playing your childish games. I have told you how to confirm that the spiritual truths I have shared are absolutely true. And how you can know the same truths with PERSONAL ASSURANCES that God is alive and well on Planet Earth for yourselves.\n \n But to do that requires that YOU TOO reach out in faith that He exists and seek Him personally for yourself. That is what you must do to meet God, and that is to reach out to Him even if it's just in the hope that He exists with no assurance of it. That is what an act of faith is. If you do that then He will find you. That is a spiritual promise made by Him in the bible and I can assure you it too is true because He found me after I prayed in the darkness of my Bedroom at 15 in the hope, but with no belief or knowledge that God existed either. The deepest fear within me as I prayed for any evidence of absolute truth of right and wrong in this life, and the reason that I exist, was that I would live this life and no God or absolute truth exists at all. \n \n I believed, and rightfully so that if there was no absolute truth in life then living in this World was like living in an Earthquake zone with no solid gound below my feet. This would be a life where one mans truth was another mans lie. Where one mans sin is another mans blessing. Where what is wrong for one man is right for another. In my young mind and heart I knew inherently that such a system of unbounded morality could only lead to chaos and anarchy. Which is precisely what this World is composed of when compared to the absolute peace and harmony that exists in Christ and in Gods Agape Love for us.\n \n You are asking me to personally PROVE to you that all that I say is real and true when all I can do is assure you of its truth and reality. In order to experience the fullness and absolute truth of what I am promising you is true you must go directly to Him who is able to save you. I am unable to do that. Only He can give you the Holy Spirit as evidence that He lives within you. And apart from Christ none are able to see or recieve Gods truths at all. So if you really want evidence that what I have told you is true then you must take this path directly to the Throne of Grace for yourself as I can take you no further than I have. So I wont respond to anymore of your childish demands for proof of the assurances I have made to you as I have given you the complete route to all that God offers us, if only you have the wisdom, awareness and hunger for His Truth to seek Him. In other words, the rest of the journey that leads to eternal truth is up to you and personally between you and God. I have given you the route, and that is all one man can give to another in regards to the gift of PERSONAL SALVATION which is between every man and God alone.",

   "The first statement is not a copout -- as I said, God created the laws...so why would He violate his own creation of laws? This would require that God is not as he says, which is \"I AM.\" God is never-changing, and thus, the laws of nature would require a change in God if they were to be broken. So what I'm saying is that God set the world up in a way that we don't understand as of yet....kind of like we don't understand how the mind of a developing organism could sense the external and beneficially alter its morphology as a result. The physical \"laws\" that we think we understand may just simply be a misunderstanding.\n \n your second statement is going against centuries of most certainly millions of cases of personal testimony to the contrary. Once again, just because something cannot be proven does not mean it doesn't happen. So many atheists picture God as being someone who lives in the clouds, but the real God lives in your heart, mind, and soul. And we've already established that matter may simply be condenced energy. So the idea that prayer cannot cure an incurable disease, for instance, actually goes against the laws of nature because it's your own person energy that is control of your physical body. Just because science cannot see this energy -- or spirit -- does not mean it doesn't exist.\n\n \n Wow, have you made a case against the existance of God.

Or perhaps they were on LSD and thought that you were a fruit stand or perhaps a giant orange aid?\n \n On the other hand you were \"in peak physical condition\" and perhaps they were sick and weak and deterred by your being buff? In my younger days I was accosted once by such a person and I cold crocked him and called the cops. Poor guy probably could not have killed a large rat he was in such poor condition.

   "Arch said, \n But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. \n \n \n \nwhat do you think scared those attackers off when the last thing that one guy said to me was, the next time I'll kill you ? \n Muggers and guys doing stick-ups are always emotionally well-balanced and not scared while committing their crimes? They never try to intimidate the victim as they disengage from their crime scene, to prevent them from yelling, retaliating, following, or whatever? Retreating from a live victim after committing a crime is not a dangerous moment for them?\n \n \n I was 17 years old and staying at the Travel Lodge on W-42nd St. in New York City in 1970. That was hooker row and remember, I didn't accept Jesus for another 5 years at 22 yrs old. It was 1:30 AM in one of the most dangerous parts of the City at the time and I decide to take a walk. I determined to NOT go into any strip clubs, bars to drink or to try to pick up any hookers because I did know this was a dangerous part of town. ...... Maybe 5 or 10 of the people I passed while on that walk actually looked and even saw me. The rest of them were walking right towards me, but strangely, they made very wide archs or loops around me. As if they couldn't walk past me because there was an obstacle on either side of the that prevented them from getting close enough to just walk past me like we all walk past each other every day of our lives on the street.\n\n \n You know, I once had a slightly similar experience, though without the hookers. The first weekend in March in 1973, my freshman year, a friend and I hitchhiked to Chicago to spend a couple of days visiting the museums and to see a Monet exhibit. We spent the evening walking the streets, mostly around the loop, to kill time and stay warm (because it was beastly cold) and we spent the night sitting/dozing in Union Station and in the Greyhound bus station (too cheap/broke for a hotel, plus we were having a sort of a contest to see who could spend less on a weekend in the big city, excluding museum entrance fees - if I recall, we clocked in a few cents on either side of $2, but I forget which of us won). Chicago had a dangerous reputation back then, so I at least was pretty nervous while walking around. Probably largely because of the cold and the late hour, but entirely in keeping with the area's unsafe reputation back then, the streets were nearly deserted and kind of spooky. I kept furtively looking at the few other people we encountered, all of whom looked suspicious and most of whom seemed to be sizing us up without making eye contact. Just as you experienced, the people seemed to detour around us for some reason. In retrospect, I suppose I should have been aware of the angelic host following me down the street, but at the time it seemed adequately explained when I suddenly realized that these scary people were in fact crossing the street to avoid us. Those scary people (and some of them seemed really scary), in fact, were afraid of us. This was a stunning revelation at the time, as I had never before thought of myself as scary.\n \n Back to you and your focus on how everyone in that section of New York was wanting to do you harm / murder you had it not been for your personal pack of protecting angels. You don't suppose that a young man, wandering down a street in a dangerous section of the city, might strike the local denizens as dangerously wrong for the scene? Perhaps trolling for trouble? Or at minimum, that you were confident in your ability to take care of yourself? You don't suppose that all those hookers, pimps, druggies, and dealers simply might not have wanted any unneccessary aggravation? \n \n \n Finally, I saw a hooker coming toward me and determined that I'm going to get this girls attention if it's the last thing I do. As she got within 10 feet of me I said loudly, HI, HOW AR YOU TONIGHT! She never even noticed me. And for a good looking kid this was beyond my comprehension as I had never experienced being invisible to any girls in my life to that point. \n\n Were you perhaps giving off conflicting emotions re the hookers? Is it maybe possible she thought you were a booming loon, or dangerous, and best avoided? Or that you looked like you were about to launch into trying to either save her or debauch yourself, and couldn't decide which? Or perhaps she needed to be someplace shortly, or perhaps she wasn't actually a prostitute and was offended by your implication? No, all of those ideas are so implausible that clearly it had to be angels.\n \n Next up: the religious implications of why people on the NY subway wouldn't talk to you even though you smiled at them nicely.",

   "1. No physical or emotional stress? According to you, in one instance, you were being mugged. In another, you were wandering an unfamiliar city, in a known dangerous area at a known dangerous time of night. And you were under absolutely no stress?\n\n \n In the first instance I was about to be mugged, It didn't happen though because I said \"Jesus Help Me\" and they saw something or someone behind me that terrified them and scared them off. When I turned around seconds later to see what it was, there was no one there. Go ahead, you explain what invisible force scared them off because beside it being Angels I can't.\n \n \n2. Oh, and you went and personally interviewed all of \"those who meant [you] harm? No? A few of them then, right? No? So, how do you know what they saw, if anything at all? You don't. You wandered around a dangerous area of a dangerous city at a dangerous time and weren't attacked. Many other people were wandering around the same area of the same city at the same time, and they weren't attacked. People avoided you and didn't make eye contact (gee, that's unusual in a large city), and 5 years later you say \"They saw angels around me and avoided me!\" You have no proof that anyone you passed intended you harm in the first place, and no idea whay they \"saw\", if anything. Instead, you attribute your \"miraculous escape\" to angelic intervention. Did everyone else who didn't get attacked in New York that night have angels intervene as well?\n\n \n Have you ever weaved your way through a crowd ? walking in a straight line for a distance and then having to go around people who's presence in the walkway prevented you from going straight past but having to go around them ? That is what people were doing on an empty sidewalk with only them and me crossing each others paths. If it was just us on the sidewalk, they could have and would have walked directly past me without having to allow any extra room at all. But these people acted as though I had people walking on either side of me that forced them to simply widen their route around me in order to avoid bumping into whoever was walking by my side. And they were looking above my head and to my left an right as if my escorts were very tall men. But no one screamed or ran away so who ever my escorts were, they didn't frighten anyone with their appearance. \n \n As to my assumption that those who saw my escorts meant me harm, I am referring to Gods ability to know what is in the heart and mind of each of us. So yes, the only way I can explain that some people that night saw me and some never even noticed me but whose eyes were glued to my invisible escorts can only be explained by what was in their hearts.\n \n \nIn the other \"example\", two muggers took your money and made their escape while uttering threats. You say they had fear in their eyes. My guess-if it was fear, it was fear of being caught. Again, you say \"They saw angels and ran away!\" And again, you have no idea what, if anything, they saw.\n \n The rest of your post is feel good twaddle that you tell yourself to feel important.\n\n \n Reread the story. They didn't get the money. I clearly said that I had 5,000 cash on me and had they found it, they may have seen fit to kill me which is why I believe I was in such imminent danger. But I said within myself, \"Jesus Help Me\" and the next thing i knew my attacker saw someone behind me that terrified him. His partner did too and saw him first because he screamed \"look\", let's get out of here. So they both saw it because the guy that said the next time I will kill you went from an expression of hate and murder to one of fear and terror. Only seconds later, after they took off, I turned to look behind me to see who scared them off and I was alone as no body was there at all.

Best all around to give a stranger a wide berth and avoid eye contact by looking above or left/right of them, that way you still have them in your peripheral vision.

Millions of people have their own personal God. But it's personal to them.

   "So your immediate response to this incident is to attribute it to an invisible heavenly chorus that supposedly only psychopaths can see? And all the other people who were almost mugged, did god intervene for them as well? What about the ones who were mugged? Why didn't god intervene for them?

But you have wasted this bandwidth arguing this non issue. And you claim I am introducing a strawman ? You waste my time with meaningless minutia and then claim to seek an interesting debate. Can you comprehend the word hypocrite ?\n\n (My bold above.)\n I can certainly comprehend the word hypocrite. Here's a definition:\n \nMain Entry: hyp&#183;o&#183;crite\n Pronunciation: 'hi-p&-\"krit\n Function: noun\n Etymology: Middle English ypocrite, from Anglo-French, from Late Latin hypocrita, from Greek hypokritEs actor, hypocrite, from hypokrinesthai\n 1 : a person who puts on a false appearance of virtue or religion\n 2 : a person who acts in contradiction to his or her stated beliefs or feelings\n - hypocrite adjective\n\n Sums you up perfectly, Arch.\n \n Anyway, I digress. How do you differentiate between a personal God, and my personal God? Here's a small selection from your recent posts referencing a personal God. Who's is this personal God, if not yours?\n \nYou must know in your own mind and heart that God is a personal God and you can only know that be seeking Him directly. Then He will confirm for you in an undeniable way that you are His and He is yours.\n \n And how you can know the same truths with PERSONAL ASSURANCES that God is alive and well on Planet Earth for yourselves.\n \n But to do that requires that YOU TOO reach out in faith that He exists and seek Him personally for yourself. That is what you must do to meet God, and that is to reach out to Him even if it's just in the hope that He exists with no assurance of it. That is what an act of faith is.\n \n You are asking me to personally PROVE to you that all that I say is real and true when all I can do is assure you of its truth and reality. In order to experience the fullness and absolute truth of what I am promising you is true you must go directly to Him who is able to save you. I am unable to do that. Only He can give you the Holy Spirit as evidence that He lives within you.\n \n In other words, the rest of the journey that leads to eternal truth is up to you and personally between you and God. I have given you the route, and that is all one man can give to another in regards to the gift of PERSONAL SALVATION which is between every man and God alone.\n \n Your excuses and attempted rationalizations are nothing more than that and carry absolutely no weight in explaining away that God is a personal God,\n \n By \"our submission\" I am referring to believers like myself who have a personal relationship with the living God.\n\n You're so keen to spout about your personal relationship with God, a relationship you can't demonstrate beyond the fanciful and anecdotal, a relationship which seems to give you the right to be arrogant, conceited, haughty and condescending to those who seek to challenge your assertions.\n \n I'll say it again, Arch, no-one here doubts that what you think happened to you is anything but your own interpretation. No-one denies that you firmly believe that. But what you keep refusing to answer is WHY we should believe you. How does your experience benefit us? How do your anecdotes prove that God and angels exist? Fanciful imaginings are not proof of anything and don't leave room for any sort of manoeuvre in trying to debate the issue.\n \n If you don't want to debate fanciful imaginings or subject yourself to intellectual criticism on a debating forum, why bring it up?",

Once while exploring the jungle with men of my unit during a quiet time (we had no information of the presence of the enemy in the area) I encountered an individual in black pajamas and a rice straw hat in the middle of the trail ahead of me. He had an evil look in his eye, as if he wanted to do me harm. I had my M-14 slung (a mistake I never made again) while he had an AK-47 leveled at me. Suddenly, the eyes of the pajama man opened wide in a look of fear, he dropped the AK, crossed his arms across his breast, and fell to his knees while bowing his head, and then fell forward in a prone position of ultimate worship and adoration. I knew immediately that he had seen a vision of a protecting angel. As I finished unslinging my 14, I knew that I had been protected by that angel. I turned around a saw him in a glorious vision, an aura of sunlight streaming through the trees behind him. It was SSGT Cripe, one of my gun commanders, who had just put two rounds into the chest of the pajama man.\n \n AA and I have seen our angles. Why do you doubt?",
