   "What are the post-abortion trauma percents?\n \n There really are none because it's debatable wether the condition truly exists. It all depends on who you ask. I have never seen nor heard of a non biased group publishing a study on the mater. I can tell you out of the thousands of abortions I have counciled women through only one has come back saying it made her already existing condtion of depression worse. Most women report a sense of relief. \n \n How safe are abortions REALLY?\n \n The most comonly stated incidance of death from surgical abortion are 1 per 100,000. (Maternal mortalitly for full term child birth is about 7 per 100,000.) Some studies report numbers closer to 1 per 1,000,000 for surgical abortion. \n \n The incidenace of hysterectomy after abortion are about 1 per 10,000 to 50,000\n \n Surgical repair after abortion1 per 1,000 to 10,000 \n \n Re-suction after abortion 1 per 500 to 1,000.\n \n as for medical abortion there have been 2 deaths associated with the process in the USA since 2000. The roughly equates to 1 per 1,000,000. However, there is a 1 in 200 chance that a medical abortion would fail and require suctioning. So it is a little more tricky to quantifiy.\n \n You can find more statistics from the sugested sites at the bottom of this post.\n \n \n What are the most widley used reasons for abortion?\n \n The beliefe that the womans life would be benifited by not having a child or being pregnant at the time. And the beliefe the fetus would not have a high likelyhood of ever having a good life. These belifes are mostly based on finances, number of children she has already, unsafe living enviorment and age. There are many more reasons as well. \n \n Why do you think abortions should/should not be made illegal?\n \n Becuase if we illegalize abortion desperate women will still seek them out and will not receive the safest and best care possible. Unwanted children are more likely to treated badly. \n \n Also, good websites to visit are greatly appriciated!\n\n \n http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/facts/index.html\n http://www.plannedparenthood.org/pp2/portal/\n http://www.ipas.org/english/",

   "Xbig_bootieX, this is a weak appeal to emotion, but unless you're facing people who have history of spotting fallacies, you're good to go.\n \n Allowing abortion allows those who are unable financial, or mentally unable to care for a child. Forcing them to have a child will unvariably create conditions that will result in poor childhood, poor habits, likely poor nutrition, and poor family structure. On the other hand, allowing abortion allows these would be society problems to disappear and let parents have kids when they are able to give them the best possible chance at life.",
