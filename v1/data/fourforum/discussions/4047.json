   "I hadn't really thought of this before, but it makes sense, as I read in the recent Ann Coulter column . . .\n \n \"Meanwhile, San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom is nipping at O'Neill's heels as the man second-most responsible for Bush's re-election. Thanks largely to Newsom's hard work, gay marriage was big news all year.\n \n In retrospect, the Democrats would have been better off if they had found every gay guy in America who actually wanted to get married and offered each one a million dollars in exchange for the Democrats not having to talk about gay marriage. (Finally -- a problem that could have been solved by throwing money at it!).\" (-- http://www.anncoulter.org/)\n \n Whether you like Coulter or not, her comments may ring true--it seems that moves by Newsom and Massachusetts brought the issue of gay marriage to the forefront, and therefore it got voted down in every ballot initiative and Bush got relected. Could it be that in some ways, Newsom's antics was even responsible for Daschle's loss?\n \n It will be interesting to see if the Dems still champion gay rights next go-around. My guess is that they won't.",

   "Personally, I think I have a command of the facts about gay marriage, It doesn't really take a degree in rocket science to figure out that gays want their relationships protected from taxes, health decisions and other the same way straights do and for the same price. I have many of the benefits of marriage from a very expensive trip to a good lawyer and it cost me a pretty penny to do it. It only costs between 30 and 100 dollars to go get a marriage license. It also cannot protect me from taxes on my house should my partern pass away. Even if your house was titled as \"joint owners\" the surviving partner has to pay inheritience taxes on a share of the house. In my state that is done at 50% of anything over 250,000 dollars of the total estate value. (50% on realestate and 20% on other values) Add the house, cars, insurance, retirement funds etc....I will be taxed very heavy. Only married spouses can get out of it.\n\n \n That was one of the first pro-gay marriage posts in which an honest acknowledgement that gay marriage was indeed \"All about the Benjamins\". I was growing weary of hearing that it was \"principle\" and not money that was driving the train. At least now we can have an honest debate on the subject. \n \n\n I would be happy to address your concerns as long as your concerns are valid and cannot be answered by saying \"do straight couples get that and gay couples not\"\n\n I have always argued my opposition to gay marriage based on financial and not moral grounds, even though I'm against gay marriage for both reasons.\n To me, it is the creation on yet another dependent class of citizen who can receive benefits that are unwarranted and additionally, has the negative effect of being another unfunded governmental mandate. It forces businesses into increased healthcare costs, for instance. It creates a whole new category of people with new legal standing in the courts with all of the concommitant costs associated with the new litigation that'll take place over custody, property, inheritance, divorce, etc.,\n While you could argue, and justifiably so, that these costs are no different than costs presently borne by society with straight couples, society has agreed to accept the costs associated with heterosexual marriage because it sees heterosexual marriage as a benefit to society. Your job is to get society to agree that there is a benefit to recognizing gay marriage that it is willing to pay for. That may not be a trivial task, IMO, because not only do you have to overcome the negative fiscal ramifications of gay marriage, but the moral trepidations that many straight people have as well.",

   "I disagree. It's not necessarily \"gay marriage\" per se that's galvanizing the opposition. It's Joe Sixpack being fed up with the in-your-face tactics of the Left. Radical Feminists, Environmentalists, PETA and now gays are all trying to use the courts to force their agenda down John Q. Public's throat and he's reached his saturation point. I don't know if there will be a Constitutional Amendment banning gay marriage or not. I'm betting that it'll be dependent on how hard gay activists push for legal gay marriage. The more they push, the greater the liklihood of an amendment. The lesson that gay activists don't get is: When you beat on a hornet's nest, prepare to get stung.\n If you want to change public opinion, you need to stop calling everyone who doesn't jump to support gay marriage \"homophobes, \"bigots\", \"gay bashers\", etc., because doing so hardens opinion against you. And once you've made an enemy of the undecided or equivocal, you've made a permanent enemy of him and given him the motivation to work against your efforts.\n I'd be much more open to the idea of gay marriage if I was debating someone who was in command of facts supporting his position and could ally my concerns as opposed to someone who immediately calls me a bigot.\n One last thought, if you're counting on a future SCOTUS to rule an Amendment that has been ratified by 37 states (hypothetical case in the future), unconstitutional, it won't happen in our lifetime.\n\n \n I do not think that this is a good explanation for several reasons. First, you are saying that gay marriage, feminists, environmentalists, and PETA are using the courts to force their agenda down John Q. Public's throat. This is a very misguided statement for a variety of reasons. First, you are blaming such a variety of issues that you might as well simply be saying \"people voted for republicans because they disagree with the the position of the democrats.\" I would not disagree with such a statement; those who voted for republicans probably did disagree with democrats on many issues. Those people you describe as pushing their agenda down the throat of others is a very prejudiced statement. Certainly only a handful of gay rights activists, feminists, environmentalists, and animal rights activits attempted to use the courts to win their case, but you have implied here that it was all those who support those issues, not a handful of people. \n \n Most importantly, you described the act of using courts to win debates as forcing an agenda down John Q. Public's throat. This is also a very bad metaphor because very few members of the population are affected by the issues in question and those who are affected are not harmed, they are, for the most part, helped. Still, because of the lack of interest in politics held by the vast majority of people, I would imagine it is safe to say that John Q. Public doesn't care one way or the other about any of those issues. There are people with an agenda to stop gay marriage, just as there are people with an agenda to legalize it, but the average American doesn't really care.\n \n That being said, the idea that an agenda is being forced down people's throats is a very poor metaphor to use. These arguments are just like any other arguments placed before the courts. You are equally justified in saying that Rosa Parks was shoving her agenda down John Q. Public's throat. Certainly it is true that the majority of the population did not support her, and that she won equality only through the acts of the courts. That seems to be your only justification for uisng the term \"shoved down John Q. Public's throat.\" In fact, the phrase probably applies more to Rosa Parks because those who wanted blacks to sit in the back of the bus were forced to sit next to black people on the bus. In the case of gay rights, those who oppose same-sex marriage are forced to do nothing.\n \n You also suggest that gay rights activists would be best off not supporting gay rights. This statement has no backing. The reasons we are even discussing same-sex marriage in this forum are all due to the work of gay rights activists. If they had supported same-sex marriage, we would see something like 1% of the population supporting it today, instead of whatever significantly higher percentage we see today. Suggesting that gay rights activists should not fight for gay rights will accomplish nothing and makes no sense.\n \n Your metaphor about hitting a hornet's nest is also misplaced. This is because it implies that gay rights activists struck those who oppose gay rights. Gay rights activists, however, have made every effort to assure that heterosexual couples are not affected by this form of equality. A better metaphor would be a hornet's nest in an apple tree. A hungry gay rights activists tries desparately not to disturb the hornet's home while getting an apple, and succeeds in not disturbing it. But the hornets come out and sting the man anyhow, sting him until he drops the apple and is unable to pick it up again.\n \n You suggested that gay rights activists need to stop calling their opponents \"bigots\", \"homophobes\", and \"gay bashers\". But I certainly had no intention of calling you those things, and I did not see anyone in this thread say them. So who is it you're refering to? It does not appear to be the majority of gay rights activists, by any means. Also, tell me whether those things are worse than being called immoral, evil, or a sinner. Opponents of gay rights tend to be extremely insulting to gay individuals, even though they may not intend it.\n \n You have said that you would be much more open to the idea of gay marriage if someone was willing to address your concerns instead of immediately calling you a bigot. Well, I have not called you a bigot, and if I insulted you in any manner in this post, I assure you it was unintentional and I apologize on the spot. So if you are willing, why not start a new topic raising your concerns about same-sex marriage so that I may try to address them? Hopefully we can get a good discussion of the topic going, at least.",

At least now we can have an honest debate on the subject. \n\n \n I cannot say I agree that it is ALL about the money, it is not just the money, but who would I be kidding if I said I didn't care. For me and many other gay couples I know. It is about inheritance taxes for the most part. The surviving partner of my relationship will be unfairly taxed on his own stuff. I own this house, yet I will pay taxes to inherit my own house. That is crazy! It also can only be avoided by either trust funds which get expensive to create or by marriage. \n \n It is also the principle that straights think their relationships are better. That two men or two women cannot have meaningful relationships. That is rubbish. I would give my life for my partner with no questions asked.

I think not. Why, our relationships don't warrant protection the same way straight relationships are? The is true homophobia. Why, because you admit that gays don't warrant something. Dude, we warrant the same things as you. In fact we are demanding them. What makes you think straight warrant more than us? Are you more human? NO! Are your relationships better? NO!\n \n\n and additionally, has the negative effect of being another unfunded governmental mandate. It forces businesses into increased healthcare costs, for instance. \n\n Most businesses already provide healthcare benefits to same sex partners. It is't anything new.\n \n\n It creates a whole new category of people with new legal standing in the courts with all of the concommitant costs associated with the new litigation that'll take place over custody, property, inheritance, divorce, etc.,\n\n \n anymore than straights?\n [QUOTE=JPSartre12]\n While you could argue, and justifiably so, that these costs are no different than costs presently borne by society with straight couples, society has agreed to accept the costs associated with heterosexual marriage because it sees heterosexual marriage as a benefit to society.

It would also stop gay youth from living up to stereotypes by teaching them they can have meaningful relationships as well as straight people can... I could go on with this but I think you can figure it out yourself.\n \nYour job is to get society to agree that there is a benefit to recognizing gay marriage that it is willing to pay for. That may not be a trivial task, IMO, because not only do you have to overcome the negative fiscal ramifications of gay marriage, but the moral trepidations that many straight people have as well.\n\n \n \n Gays tend to have higher educations and make more money. They will have more lavish weddings and spend more money doing it. It is not just a stereotype that gay men wear nicer clothes, buy better cars etc......Advertising people are finally getting it! Gay men especially, have the highest disposalable income of any other group. Why:\n 1) Men make more money\n 2)gays tend to have higher educations, therefore having better jobs.\n 3)For the most part..no kids, no dependents....it is all there to spend.\n \n Spending jumps the economy!!!",

A high turnout amongst the Ohio Christians is but one example.\n \n\n That being said, the idea that an agenda is being forced down people's throats is a very poor metaphor to use.

It is just a phase and it will not last. Gay marriage will come, the ammedments banning it will be ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme court eventually. \n\n \n With a little digging, I could come up with many more examples. It doesn't further the civil discourse that you and I would rather engage in. Instead, it acts as a verbal chip on the shoulder daring the opposition to knock it off and in November, that's exactly what many voters did. I'm convinced that with many, it was a gutteral response to a perceived threat.\n \n\n You have said that you would be much more open to the idea of gay marriage if someone was willing to address your concerns instead of immediately calling you a bigot.
