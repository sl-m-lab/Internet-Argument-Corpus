More gay men\n \n \n AC360 snagged George Rekers rent boy Lucien for his first television interview, which aired on the program last night.

He also disclosed a signed contract between himself and Rekers which, according to the program, stated that Lucien \"must the carry bags, provide a massage for at least one hour every day of the trip in their shared room. Plus, spend at least 8 hours day with him, including two meals.\" All that for $75 a day.",
