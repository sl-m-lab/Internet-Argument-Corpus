   "i think very little will change actually\n the palestinians don't need another martyr to kill, they have plenty \"reasons\" to already\n and israeli will continue to kill as long as they are being targetted.\n \n \nThe Fear Factor\n By BRET STEPHENS\n March*23,*2004\n \n JERUSALEM -- Are Palestinians weeds? It would seem many people think they are. Following Israel's assassination early yesterday morning of Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of Hamas, the gist of international reaction was that the strike would bring new converts to the Islamist cause and incite a fresh wave of terrorist violence against Israel. In other words, Palestinians are weeds: Mowing them down, as it were, only has the effect of making them grow back stronger and faster.\n \n There are moments (Monday morning was one of them) when I find myself tempted by the metaphor. As I write, my TV screen is filled with images of Palestinian mourners thronging the streets of Gaza, praising Yassin as a martyr and vowing deadly vengeance. This looks like the reaction of an emboldened people, not a frightened one. So what's the sense, in purely utilitarian terms, of further Israeli attacks? Alternatively, what's the sense of showing any restraint at all? If the weed metaphor is right, either Israel should sue for peace on whatever terms the Palestinians extend or it should resort to extreme measures like population transfer. Anything else just fruitlessly prolongs a cycle of violence.\n \n But of course Palestinians aren't weeds. They're human. They think in terms of costs and benefits, they calculate the odds, they respond more or less rationally to incentives and disincentives. And what makes us afraid can also make them afraid.\n \n This is a trite observation, but it's one Palestinians would rather have us forget. Over 42 months of conflict, their strategy has been to persuade Israelis that they, the Palestinians, are made of different stuff. Why else the suicide bombers? Not because of their proven capacity to kill civilians in greater numbers than any other weapon currently in the Palestinian arsenal. That's only a second-order effect. The deep logic of suicide bombing lies in the act of suicide itself. People who will readily die for their cause are, by definition, beyond deterrence. By showing that Israel's tanks and fighter jets are just so much scrap metal in the face of the Palestinians' superhuman determination, they aim to disarm Israel itself.\n \n How does one respond to such a logic? It helps not to be fooled by it. Again, allow me to make the trite observation that Palestinians love their children too. To date, there has not been a single instance in which a Hamas leader sent one of his own sons or daughters on a suicide mission. I once interviewed a Hamas leader, since deceased, as he bounced his one-year-old girl on his knee. Contrary to myth, this was not a man who was afraid of nothing. Unsparing as he was with the lives of others, he was circumspect when it came to the lives of his own.\n \n Indeed, when one looks closely at just who the suicide bombers are (or were), often they turn out to be society's outcasts. Take Reem Salah al-Rahashi, a mother of two, who in January murdered four Israeli soldiers at the Erez checkpoint on the Gaza-Israel border. In a prerecorded video, Rahashi said becoming a shaheed was her lifelong dream. Later it emerged she'd been caught in an extramarital affair, and that her husband and lover had arranged her \"martyrdom operation\" as an honorable way to settle the matter. It is with such people, not with themselves, that Palestinian leaders attempt to demonstrate their own fearlessness.\n \n In the early months of the intifada, this macho pretense was sustained by the Israeli government's tacit decision not to target terrorist ringleaders, for fear such attacks would inspire massive retaliation. Yassin and his closest associates considered themselves immune from Israeli reprisals and operated in the open. What followed was the bloodiest terrorist onslaught in Israeli history, climaxing in a massacre at Netanya in March 2002. After that, Israel invaded the West Bank and began to target terrorist leaders more aggressively.\n \n The results, in terms of lives saved, were dramatic. In 2003, the number of Israeli terrorist fatalities declined by more than 50% from the previous year, to 213 from 451. The overall number of attacks also declined, to 3,823 in 2003 from 5,301 in 2002, a drop of 30%. In the spring of 2003, Israel stepped up its campaign of targeted assassinations, including a failed attempt on Yassin's deputy, Abdel Aziz Rantisi. Wise heads said Israel had done nothing except incite the Palestinians to greater violence. Instead, Hamas and other Islamic terrorist groups agreed unilaterally to a cease-fire.\n \n In this context, it bears notice that between 2002 and 2003 the number of Palestinian fatalities also declined significantly, from 1,000 to about 700. The reason here is obvious: As the leaders of Palestinian terror groups were picked off and their operations were disrupted, they were unable to carry out the kind of frequent, large-scale attacks that had provoked Israel's large-scale reprisals. Terrorism is a top-down business, not vice versa. Targeted assassinations not only got rid of the most guilty but diminished the risk of open combat between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian foot soldiers.\n \n Now a few words about Yassin, the international reaction to his killing, and the likely result for Israel. It may be recalled that Israel released the good sheikh in 1997, after having sentenced him to life in prison, with the promise that he would never again promote terrorism. This was during the Oslo years, when serious people actually thought that such conciliatory gestures served the interests of peace. Today, that is beyond comprehension. At any rate, Yassin didn't keep his promise.\n \n Meanwhile, assorted foreign ministers are in full throat against Israel. \"All of us understand Israel's need to protect itself -- and it is fully entitled to do that -- against the terrorism that affects it, within international law,\" says British Foreign Minister Jack Straw. \"But it is not entitled to go in for this kind of unlawful killing.\"\n \n It would be interesting to know exactly what, according to Mr. Straw, Israel is lawfully allowed to do in self-defense. Perhaps it would be as well if the minister also reminded the Palestinian Authority of its obligations, under the Road Map, to \"undertake visible efforts . . . to arrest, disrupt, and restrain individuals and groups conducting and planning attacks on Israelis.\" But if Mr. Straw and his colleagues do not do so, it is not from an excess of respect for the Palestinians, but rather its lack. They will, after all, be viewing them merely as weeds, not as humans capable of acting in their own best interests.\n \n Mr. Stephens is editor in chief of the Jerusalem Post.\n URL for this article:\n http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB108000585017162510,00.html\n \n",

   "Oh, well then, whenever the U.N. speaks, they MUST be right LMAO Doesn't matter that they are anti-American and anti-Israeli, does it?\n\n \n Israel is a UN nation, which means those are the rules they agree to play by. If they no longer want to be a UN nation, they are welcome to withdraw from the UN. They will loose the privelages that come with being a UN nation, but they would no longer be bound to follow UN mandates, as they are by their own choice now. \n \n \n \nYou've mentioned this several times, how do they do that? Don't get defensive, just curious\n\n \n IS this a joke? This is a thread about a palestenian who was assasinated using a helicopter gunship and a rocket barage. IF that is not using your military against your own population, I don't know what is. THey have also used tanks and troops extensively in the gaza strip and attacked palestenian headquarters buildings with cruise missiles.\n \n \nJust for kicks, huh? You seem to have a problem with countries willing to take their national security into their own hands, and NOT relying on the U.N.\n\n \n The last cross border attack they made was on a refuge camp in syria. They have also bombed nuclear facilities in Iran, even after the facilities had been certified as being related to power production NOT weapons production (like israel really has any room to take the moral high ground on nukes). YOu are NOT allowed to make unilateral cross border strikes under international law. THis is just the way it is. Of course, Israel could withdraw from the UN as outlined before, then they would actually have some fudge room to say \"we haven't agreed to those rules. \n \n \n \nFull scale war!!! They could obliterate those animals without breaking a sweat and the world would have one less problem to deal with. I didn't realize you were an insider and knew all the conversations that occur between the U.S. and Israel. I think it's a safe bet that we are putting a great deal of pressure on them to show restraint\n\n \n Again, since they are apparently already using their troops against the palestenians, what restrictions do you feel have been put on them? Showing a great deal of restraint generally does NOT include the use of gunships, fighter planes, tanks and mortars against your own population. THis would be the exact opposite of showing restraint.\n \n There would not be a full scale war in Israel, even if the international community was not looking on. The palestenians know they could not win, so things would continue as they are now, with gurilla attacks followed by executions without benifit of trial by the Israelis. Of course, the Israelis could \"ethnically cleanse\" their country. Just start shooting the palestenians on a larger scale than they already are now.\n \n \n \nLOL what in the world do you have against Israel anyway? It's obvious there's an issue here, because you can't even admit the victories they HAVE enjoyed, there has to be some OTHER reason for the victories. Hell, we could use your argument about practically every country then..gimme a break. The fact is, they defend themselves and to hell with the rest of the world. Maybe we could learn a thing or two from them\n\n \n What do I have against ISrael? THey are a terrorist state. THis thread is about the fact that they have assasinated a memebr of their population, plus those that were aorund him. THis guy was not sentenced to dreath in a court. HE was tried several years ago, sentenced to life in prson, then later released. THey launched a rocket barage against him. I am an American who firmly believes in the ideals behind the american constitution and our legal system. One of those is that you do not execute people without benifit of trial. When Mc Veigh blew up the federal building in oklahoma, our law enforcement officials found him. HE was tried and executed for his crimes. We did not scrambe a squad of apache helicopters to hunt him down and destroy him with anti tank rockets.\n \n For US officials, who have sworn to uphold our constituon, to support a terrorist state that engages in such tactics is reprehensible. While it is true that Israel is not bound by the ideals set forth in our constitution, our officials should be and should not support such a tyranical regime.\n \n A far as the great and fierce israli army, I say pull the billions and billions of dollars in US aid to israel and we can see how long they last. I would guess somewhere beteween 2 and 5 days. THis is bevcause ISrael is a welfare state. tHey cannot afford to feed themselves without the massive US subsudies they get now, and they certainly couldn't afford to fight any kind of war. Here is a page that covers US aid to Israel pretty well\n \n http://www.wrmea.com/html/us_aid_to_israel.htm\n \n Now, I am not against helping out US citizens who need a hand. I am not against sending food to starving nations in Africa that are suffering from a draught. I am not against lending a hand to stop large scale ethnic cleansing. I am absolutly, totally, 100% against providing billions to a welfare state that cannot support itself and realistically will most likely never be able to be independant. I am especially against this when it is a nation that has such racist and tyranical practices as Isreal. \n \n THat is my problem with ISrael. IT is time for the US to pull our unconditional support from ISrael and let them sink on thier own. You will note I don't say \"sink or swim\" becasue there is absolutly no possibility that ISrael can survive unless the US is there to babysit them. You are talking about a country with virtually no natural resources, a poor industrial infrastructure, and that has managed to alienate it's neiborighing countries completely which puts them in such a position of instability that no reasonable businessman anywhere in the world would want to take the chance of dealing with them. \n \n What exactly has Israel done that garners the deep degree of respect that you seem to give them? IS it simply the fact that after the US sunk billions of dollars into their military to ensure that they had a vast technological superiority over their neiborghing countries they managed to repel attacks and institute a land grab back in the 60's? \n \n At one time I thought that the rabid Israeli supporters here in the US were mostly Jewish fundamentalists, until I started talking to my Jewish friends and in laws and found that there is a very large jewish base in the US composed of individuals who find the thought that they are somehow connected to the terroristic and tyranical acts by the Israeli government abslutly offensive. \n \n I actually came to blows with an old and dear friend who was offended becasue I assumed he supported the \"zionist murderers\" (his words).\n \n Now, it seems that the the most vocal Israeli supporters in the US are neocons who see the Israeli conflict as some kind of \"big wanker\" contest and feel that Israel should fell free to do as they wish simply becaus ethe US says so.",

   "I think that the problem is that people are saying that the Palestinians are citizens of Israel and treating every Palestinian as such. However, they are mistaken in that there is generally an agreed upon difference between a militant and a civilian in terms of citizenship. For example, if there was a group of people in the United States who were plotting to overthrow it, using suicide bombers aimed at women and children, they would be committing treason and would forfeit many of the rights that are afforded to citizens. Granted that we grant a lot more rights to people living within our borders than Israel does, and so it is an imperfect example.\n \n Look at intent. The Hamas group is working to achieve their aims through terror directed at civilians. If they directed their efforts toward the Israeli army or actual government, I might be more sympathetic. Yet when innocents are killed, on both sides, I tend to look at the other's point of view more. The Israelis have more of an excuse, as they use (semi) precision strikes to decapitate the leadership of the other's organization and end up causing collateral damage. The palestinians, on the other hand, actively try to increase such collateral damage.",

As soon as the convoy approached they would have rushed him back into the building and you'd see people gathering out in front.\n\n \n Bin laden is the head of a multinational terrorist organisation. This guy was a quadrapalegic that hey have not been able to prove conclusively is still invloved in the operational side of ANY terrorist organisation. \n \n AS far as it being so difficult/impossible to get him, I would say put the guy who got him ast time in charge. They didn;t seem to have any problem then, nor have they had any real problem with arresting other palestenians. They have simply quite trying. NOw, they find you objectionable enough they send their military to murder you. Perhapse they don;t think they could get these people convicted in a court. The methedos of the Israeli government seem to be unpopular eve to their own people.\n \n \n \nI think that the problem is that people are saying that the Palestinians are citizens of Israel and treating every Palestinian as such. However, they are mistaken in that there is generally an agreed upon difference between a militant and a civilian in terms of citizenship. For example, if there was a group of people in the United States who were plotting to overthrow it, using suicide bombers aimed at women and children, they would be committing treason and would forfeit many of the rights that are afforded to citizens. Granted that we grant a lot more rights to people living within our borders than Israel does, and so it is an imperfect example.\n\n \n So the fact that Israel openly imposes racist standards in granting citizenship and thus rights is some kind of defense?\n \n \nLook at intent. The Hamas group is working to achieve their aims through terror directed at civilians. If they directed their efforts toward the Israeli army or actual government, I might be more sympathetic. Yet when innocents are killed, on both sides, I tend to look at the other's point of view more. The Israelis have more of an excuse, as they use (semi) precision strikes to decapitate the leadership of the other's organization and end up causing collateral damage. The palestinians, on the other hand, actively try to increase such collateral damage.\n\n \n Using mortars is NOT a preicion strike. Granted in recent times they have switched to aircraft and cruise missiles, that hardly provides justification for murdering memebers of your own populations without benefit of trial. Put yourself in the palestenians situation. YOu cannot reasonably expect to be able to hit fortified military bases, and the leadership of israel is made up of absolute cowards who order strikes like this and then disapear from public view for several weeks to ensure that they are not killed, leaving their population to take the brunt of the retaliation for their murderous acts.\n \n While striking civilians is unarguably a poor thing to do, it has always been the method used by those who are unable to strike back at an unreahable government.",

   "HE WAS NOT the current leader of Hamas.\nWhere did you get such a hair-brained notion? The entire international media recognized Yassin as top leader. Even Hamas itself considered Yassin the top man in their group, which is why al-Jazeera reported this week that \"Rantisi was elected on Tuesday as the supreme leader of Hamas in Gaza, replacing the slain Shaikh Yasin.\" Do you think you know more than Hamas about who leads their organization?\n \n \n \nThe last time he was arrested, he was released after promising not to be involved in the administration of any terrorist group.\nPromises, promises! Such naivete perhaps explains your bewilderment.\n \n \n \nHe was assasinated because he was an icon for the palestenians. He was murdured for ideals, not actions.\nSure he was icon, just as Arafat is an icon. But Yassin is dead, while Arafat lives, because such iconic status is not the reason he was hit. Arafat at least gives occasional lip service to the nebulous peace process, whereas Yassin makes no pretense in his public determination to kill every Jew he can. For the very same reason, al-Rantisi and Muhammad Deif are now at the top of Israel's hit list.\n \n \n \nIn afghanistan we are using military tactics against recognised combatants in a designated combat zone. You don't see the difference between this and assasinating a civilian member of your population?\nSuch thinking is muddled. First, you err in assuming that Yassin was a member of Israel's population. Rather, he was a resident of neighboring Gaza, not a citizen of Israel. Second, even if one does assume Yassin was a member of Israel's population, in Yassin's worldview there are no Israeli civilians, and since all Israelis are presumed combatants, your reference to killing \"a civilian member\" of the population is pointless.\n \n Turning now to your comparison of U.S. tactics in Afghanistan or Iraq vs Israeli tactics in the territories, you seem to think there's a marked distinction. In our war on terror, our fighters do their best to kill or arrest the enemy behind the violence perpetrated against us. Same as Israel! The enemy we fight does not wear uniforms. Same as Israel's enemy! The enemy we fight mingles with civilians and compromises their safety. Same as Israel's enemy. Really, I don't see a noteworthy difference, and since you neglected to explain yourself, perhaps you'll elaborate on your meaning.\n \n \n \nMeasures that are considered acceptable on the field of battle are NOT always acceptable in civil law enforcement.\nThere is no 'field of battle' apart from the towns and villages where the enemy finds shelter. And what is the role of 'civil law enforcement' when it comes to taking down al-Qaeda recruits, or Baathist insurrectionists, or Hamas operatives? When NY and DC were hit on 9-11, did you find our response was left to the police. Civil law enforcement certainly has a role in the fight against terror, but anyone can see that the heavy lifting is not done by civilians but by our military.",

   "I think that the problem is that people are saying that the Palestinians are citizens of Israel\nYes, I've noticed some writers in this forum have that problem. I'm not sure why that is. The nomenclature used to be fairly simple. In 1948 when Israel was founded, Palestinian Jews began referring to themselves as Israelis. Palestinian Arabs residing within Israel's borders were called Israeli-Arabs. Palestinian Arabs residing under Jordanian and Egyptian occupation in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem gradually began to refer to themselves simply as Palestinians. The situation was a bit more confused after 1967 when Israel assumed the administration of East Jerusalem and gave Israeli identity cards to the residents there for the purpose of voting in municipal elections.\n \n \n \nthere is generally an agreed upon difference between a militant and a civilian in terms of citizenship.\nI never heard of such thing. Who are the parties to any such agreement that distinguishes between militants and civilians, and why would one's status as militant have any bearing on citizenship?\n \n \n \nFor example, if there was a group of people in the United States who were plotting to overthrow it, using suicide bombers aimed at women and children, they would be committing treason and would forfeit many of the rights that are afforded to citizens.\nI'm not clear if your discussion applies equally to Israel or just the U.S. In any event, I'm a little bit familiar with treason in U.S. law, since many people wondered whether John Walker (the American Taliban) would be charged with treason. He wasn't. Interestingly, treason is the only word that is specifically defined in the U.S. Constitution. The issue was an important matter of discussion among the Founding Fathers. The concept of treason in English common law had often been abused by the king. There was not only considerable debate at the Convention in Philadelphia, but also remarks in the ratifying conventions of the various states, as well as contemporaneous public comment. The final result makes clear that a restrictive concept of the crime was imposed. I'm not entirely certain, but I think that no charges of treason have been prosecuted in at least 50 years, since the WW2 era. As was the case with Walker a year or so ago, acts that might ordinarily be treasonable in nature are generally punished under a different label.\n \n In any event, a link to Section 3 of Article III of the Constitution is found here. It's concise, but note that Congress alone has the power to declare the punishment of treason.\n \n You noted above that treason is a sufficient cause of forfeiture of \"many of the rights that are afforded to citizens.\" Congress did deal with the question of punishment. Whoever is guilty of treason shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office in the U.S. I'm not sure when Congress last revisited this section of the U.S. Code. It is found in Title 18: Section 2381.\n \n \n \nGranted that we grant a lot more rights to people living within our borders than Israel does, and so it is an imperfect example.\nDid you mean citizens instead of residents? Either way, I ask that you please provide specific examples of what you mean that people living in the U.S. have a lot more rights than people in Israel.",

The U.S., Canada, and the EU no longer make such distinction. Get a hankie and shed a tear for the terrorists' fund-raising charities and bank accounts now shut down.\n \n Labeling Yassin as \"Israel's Bin Laden\" is an apt comparison. Both were the founders and funders of their respective organizations. It wasn't their role to dirty their hands in the field. Indeed, by your criteria we should simply leave Bin Laden alone, since he was merely an inspirational figure--what you call an icon--while the real military head of al-Qaeda was Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9-11 attacks, as well as the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa.

Either way, you're going to object to Israeli efforts to root out terror, no matter if Israel goes in by ground or by air. Still, it's curious that you prefer a tactic that is certain to cause greater destruction and suffering to innocent bystanders and their property.\n \n \n \nNOw, they find you objectionable enough they send their military to murder you.\nIndeed, that is sometimes exactly the way it is done. It's no different for our soldiers in Iraq. In Yassin's case, with IAF jets overhead to muffle the sound of the approaching choppers, he and his bodyguards never saw it coming.

On the other hand, in Marwan Barghouti's case two years ago--he was leader of Al-Aqsa Brigades--when the IDF first moved back into the West Bank they were able to trap him in a compound and force his surrender to save his life to stand trial. Every case proceeds on its own merits. \n \n \n \nPerhaps they don't think they could get these people convicted in a court.

Administrative detention in the interim will be sufficient to keep him in jail.\n \n \n \nSo the fact that Israel openly imposes racist standards in granting citizenship...\nEvery nation imposes standards in granting citizenship, but to assert as 'fact' that Israel's standard is based on race is merely to display once again your poor fund knowledge regarding Israeli citizenship law. In our previous exchanges you have never once been willing to support such misstatements of 'fact' with credible evidence, but please feel free not to wimp out again.\n \n \n \nGranted in recent times they have switched to aircraft and cruise missiles, that hardly provides justification for murdering members of your own populations without benefit of trial.\nDo you mean to never learn something so simple as the fact that Sheikh Yassin was neither an Israeli, nor even a resident of Israel? Why do you persist in counting him among Israel's population? Even hearing the very name of Israel was enough to give him an allergic reaction, but (Praise Be Unto Allah) the Zionist entity did cure him. I don't read Arabic, but I assume here is a tribute to the man who was the brains behind the founding of Hamas. Scroll down at your own risk.\n \n \n \nPut yourself in the palestenians situation... While striking civilians is unarguably a poor thing to do, it has always been the method used by those who are unable to strike back at an unreachable government.\nThe Palestinian Arabs had no real need to pick a fight at all. The 'arguably best thing' to have done was to do as the Jews did: abide by the 1947 UN recommendation to live side-by-side in peace and economic cooperation. If the Palestinian leadership then had been willing to share the land, declare their own state alongside Israel in accordance with Res 181, and recognize the legitimate aspirations of Jews to live in their historic homeland as a free and independent people, then I think Arab Palestine would have developed into the most prosperous and free of all the Arab states. Even now, it may not be too late, but with groups around like Hamas, who sole purpose for existence is to annihilate the Jewish state, I don't suppose we'll get a chance to find out.",

As some of you may know I support Israel. \n I was displeased with the killing of Yassin..... it should have been done long ago. Yassin was a terrorist leader. He advocated and religiously vindicated terrorist acts that left hundreds of innocent men, women and children dead. \n A terrorist is a terrorist and he deserved to die just as Osama does. \n If the USA had a chance at killing Osama we would grab it. There would be no hesitation. Furthermore we should realize there would be no great condemnation from the world community. \n \n Speaking of the world community.\n They sicken me. I'm sick of the UN and have long lost all respect for them. They have earned my hatred. They wanted to keep the Iraqi people under oppressive rule, Arafat protected and now they wish to condemn the only free country in the middle east for protecting its citizens and delivering justice.\n Every world leader (with the exception of the US) has called the killing of Yassin \"horrific\" \"disturbing\" and Kofi Annan went as far as to call it \"contrary to international law\". \n Can not one world leader stand up and point out the obvious double standard given to Israel. Israel like every other country has the right to confront terrorism and eleminate terrorists. \n The US can invade Afghanistan in seek of justice and the world stands behind them but when Israel launches a missle and kills a terrorist leader the world condemns them? How dare they. Its illogical and ridiculous. \n \n I have heard those who disagree with me say \"but Israel only acheived delaying the peace process\". And I say to you: You fools. There was no peace process in action. Only within the past weeks a suicide bombing killed innocent people. Where was this rush to condemn such an action? \n With such actions constantly taking place there can be no peace. Its a complete contradiction to the idea. With terrorists such as Yassin and Arafat holding primary positions and influence there will be no peace and no negotiations.\n Hammas' well known goal was the destruction of Israel and the killing of Jews.

In our previous exchanges you have never once been willing to support such misstatements of 'fact' with credible evidence, but please feel free not to wimp out again.\n\n \n \"Following the mass exodus and displacement of the indigenous Palestinian Arab population in 1948, Israel adopted discriminatory citizenship, nationality and residency laws that effectively denationalized Palestinian refugees and prevented them from returning to their places of origin. Citizenship and nationality in Israel is based on a two-tier system, one for Jews and the other for &#8216;non-Jews.&#8217; On the one hand, any Jew can acquire automatic citizenship and residency, based on the notion of &#8216;historical residence,&#8217; under the 1950 Law of Return. The law grants all Jews, regardless of their national origin or citizenship, the right to citizenship and residency in Israel. \n \n On the other hand, the indigenous Palestinian Arab population including refugees must be able to prove (among a list of 5 conditions for those born before the establishment of the state of Israel and 3 conditions for those born after) that they were in the state of Israel on or after 14 July 1952, or the offspring of a Palestinian who meets this condition. Due to the fact that most Palestinian refugees were displaced outside the borders of the state of Israel on or after 14 July 1952, they are unable to resume domicile in their homeland. In practice, naturalization only occurs in extraordinary cases. Israeli citizenship is almost never granted to non-Jews. \"\n \n THe cato institute has a pretty good article about it on their page at http://www.cato.org/dailys/03-23-04-2.html\n \n \nDo you mean to never learn something so simple as the fact that Sheikh Yassin was neither an Israeli, nor even a resident of Israel? Why do you persist in counting him among Israel's population? Even hearing the very name of Israel was enough to give him an allergic reaction, but (Praise Be Unto Allah) the Zionist entity did cure him. I don't read Arabic, but I assume here is a tribute to the man who was the brains behind the founding of Hamas. Scroll down at your own risk.\n\n \n Really? I was under the impression that he was born in Ashkelon in either 1929 or 1938 (passport says 29, he claims 38) where they lived unil 1948, when they were forced out during the creation of the state fo israel. After that he lived in gaza refuge camps. I also thought he was killed in Gaza city, whihc I believe is located in te Gaza strip, whihc to the best of my knowledge is part of the occupied territories. Yes, I am almost certain of it. YOu can take a look at http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gz.html it is the CIA world factbook and does some expalining about the region, such as where it is.\n \n Not exactly a tribute, though definatly supportive. You should really learn to read/speak arabic and hebrew if you are going to try to undersand these things, unless of course you are just in it for the gory pictures. You get a lttle different perspective when you actually look at the news coming directly from both sdes, as opposed to traslated clips in english speaking media.\n \n \nThe Palestinian Arabs had no real need to pick a fight at all. The 'arguably best thing' to have done was to do as the Jews did: abide by the 1947 UN recommendation to live side-by-side in peace and economic cooperation. If the Palestinian leadership then had been willing to share the land, declare their own state alongside Israel in accordance with Res 181, and recognize the legitimate aspirations of Jews to live in their historic homeland as a free and independent people, then I think Arab Palestine would have developed into the most prosperous and free of all the Arab states. Even now, it may not be too late, but with groups around like Hamas, who sole purpose for existence is to annihilate the Jewish state, I don't suppose we'll get a chance to find out.\n\n \n Surely this is a joke, right? \n \n It is pretty clear why Israel chose to assasinate Yassin, and why they chose to do it now. They have agreed to a withdrawal of forces from the gaza strip and to turn over ruling authority to the Palesteniain authority. They have attached a condition to this, namely that the PAlestenian authority clamp down on attacks. A while back, Arrafat was in a position to do so, and even issued several public statements calling for an end to attacks. Shortly after, Arrafat was attacked and his authority weakened to the point thta he could no longer control the militants. THe palestenian Authority has worked vary hard to gain some degree of control in regards to these groups. Of late it has appeared that they had a good chance of being able to deliver on Israels condition. \n \n Now, Israel does not want to pull ou of Gaza, and they don't want the attacks to stop. Israel is a worthless land with few natural resources and no real chance of developing any type of decent industrial complex. Gaza, on the other hand, is capable of being self sustaining due to their centuries old olive market. Israel needs to hold onto gaza, and needs the attacks to continue so they can continue to recieve billions of dollars in welfare from the US. Do you really think that the US government could justify spending so much money on a worthless country that will never be capable of sustaining itself if they weren;t able to cite the terrorist attacks as a reason for aid?\n \n Facing the loss of the only protion of Israel which is inherently profitable, and the possibility of reduced US welfare, they did the only logical thing, which was to murder an old spiritaul leader so they could ensure that the attacks would continue.",

   "See, there you go again. JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A WHEELCHAIR DOES NOT MAKE YOU ANY LESS A MURDERER. My gosh... if bin Laden was in a wheel chair it makes me wonder if you would be attacking the US for making hide in caves. :-\\ He's been in the wheel chair since he was a child. Why is al Jazeera and all the other news organizations reporting that he was head of the organization then? A massive lie? Why is Hamas saying that they elected the new guy as their top leader? If Yassin wasn't him where did the top leader go?\n \n *Big grin* You know that Yassin just recently when on a huge fundraising tour of the Middle East, do you not? In 1998 he visited Iran, Saudi Arabia, and many other nations seeking money to continue his jihad. He raised 100 million dollars in those two countries alone. So to answer your question, yes, he was actively involved in fundraising. I think you need to read up more on Yassin...\n \n Oh, really? That woman and her baby are the illegal occupiers of Palestinian lands? That is not military target. I said before that military targets are different. They don't target the military, they target innocent civillians.\n \n I am so sick of this myth that Israel is the big bad wolf. Jordan holds 77% of historic Palestine. Jordan is 75% Palestinian. Jordan was created as the Palestinian state. Why in the world isn't Hamas attacking the real occupier of Palestinian lands? Because they aren't Jewish?\n \n When you stack up CONFLICT deaths of innocent civillians the Israelis are the ones hard hit, not the Palestinians. Again, another myth--that more innocent Palestinians die. To use your words, the Israelis are equipped with the latest technology. It's quite misleading to count a Palestinian who pointed a rifle at an Israeli soldier as an innocent civillian killed.",

   "Just thought I'd toss this article from WorldNetDaily in.\n \n \n\n The satanic sheik and the enablers of evil\n Posted: March 26, 2004\n 1:00 a.m. Eastern\n \n \u00a9 2004 WorldNetDaily.com\n \n Nothing about Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder of Hamas, the Murder Inc. of the Middle East, was divinely inspired. Contrary to the descriptions, Yassin was not the Dalai Lama of Gaza. Yet this wicked bag of bones was - and still is - labeled as a \"spiritual leader.\"\n \n To call him a \"moderate\" is no less of a misrepresentation, unless one is referring to unforeseen developments in theology. This (now gratefully) dead yahoo had deigned to accept a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza - only if it were to be used as a temporary base to destroy Israel.\n \n Both al-Qaida and the native Palestinian terror networks are comprised of killers who target innocent non-combatants. Their mission and tactics are identical. Yet al-Qaida is referred to appropriately and almost unanimously in the media as \"a terrorist network,\" and its capo di tutti capi - bin Laden - is dubbed \"Public Enemy No. 1.\" Yet, Hamas - the organization that pioneered and perfected the diabolical \"suicide attack\" - is mostly given a free pass in news reports.\n \n Hamas' ghastly acts are seldom spoken of as \"terrorism,\" or its agents of death as \"terrorists.\" The Agence France-Presse went so far as to finesse a recent Hamas bloodbath as \"a joint operation carried out by hardline Palestinian groups\" (emphasis mine). When describing Palestinian terrorists, the American media generally prefer such labels as \"suicide attacks\" or \"suicide bombings.\" These are invariably committed by \"militants,\" not murderers - tough guys, not terrorists.\n \n Since September 2000, Hamas has murdered 377 \"Israelis,\" wounding over 2,000 more. Members of the press like the unqualified term, \"Israelis.\" It exempts them from reporting that the slaughtered are all innocent civilians. Which is exactly the point.\n \n In \"The Case for Israel,\" Alan Dershowitz, Harvard law professor and indefatigable civil libertarian, elucidates the moral components of the vortex of terror and counterterror, action and reaction into which the Palestinians have plunged Israel. He observes that the number of innocent Israelis killed intentionally by Palestinians is considerably higher than the number of innocent Palestinians who have been killed accidentally by the Israel Defense Force.\n \n The vast majority of Palestinians killed by Israelis are directly involved in terrorist activity. Those not directly involved were killed accidentally in the course of legitimate military actions against terrorists. \"Israel's moral responsibility for these accidental, although often foreseeable, casualties of war,\" he avers, \"is in no way comparable to the responsibility of Palestinian terrorists who have deliberately targeted every single Israeli civilian victim.\"\n \n This distinction, one would presume, is a no-brainer: \"Every reasonable school of philosophy, theology, jurisprudence and common sense distinguishes between deliberately targeting civilians and inadvertently killing civilians while targeting terrorists who hide among them\" (emphasis mine). Nevertheless, anti-Zionist bigots, who understand the difference between accidental death and willful murder in \"other contexts,\" embrace moral relativism when it comes to the Jewish state.\n \n Professor Dershowitz makes one other particularly chilling observation:\n \n Israel has nothing to gain and everything to lose from inflicting civilian casualties. The opposite is true for the Palestinian terrorists. Palestinian casualties play in their favor, and Israeli casualties play in their favor.\n \n Indeed, the reason quite a few pundits, the United Nations and other masters of moral equivalence look benignly on those who target Israelis with \"anti-personnel bombs made of nails soaked in rat poison\" is (partly) that they blame Israel for Palestinian depravity. Thus, when Hamas or the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades kills innocents, the \"civilized\" world mitigates their monstrosities with root-causes rhetoric, thus nurturing the soil for further flowers of evil.\n \n This is to be expected from liberals. They are, after all, determinists who reject personal responsibility. To such flaming Freudians, traumatic toilet training is a sufficient justification for anything. But what excuse do those on the far right and on the (often far-out) libertarian side have? These factions pretend to have a coherent philosophy, central to which are free will and personal responsibility - except when it comes to their precious Palestinians.\n \n Members of the Jews-Control-America crowd, in particular, have lost their moral bearings completely and go so far as to call Palestinian terrorists \"freedom fighters.\" In doing so, they have adopted the post-modernist leftist view of morality as a \"cultural construct.\" Ask any liberal, and he'll tell you: Historical baggage exempts the \"oppressed\" forever from being held to the same standards as other (non-murderous) mortals.\n \n In addition to their international exculpators, Palestinians reward their terrorists for the massacres they perpetrate. The residents of the West Bank and Gaza house, hide and canonize killers as \"martyrs.\"\n \n Conversely, Israeli soldiers who are implicated in the accidental death of civilians face a critical public. Unlike the Palestinians, whose politics are nothing more than genocide, Israel is a moral society. Israeli soldiers must answer to military boards of inquiry. Israel is blessed with a free (and mostly liberal media). And, incredibly, a great many Israelis are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.\n \n Yassin's ghoulish \"spirit\" guided many an atrocity. His assassination was not in breach of international law - it was not an \"extra-judicial killing.\" \"Under international law and the laws of war,\" Professor Dershowitz reminds us, \"it is entirely legal to target and kill an enemy combatant who had not surrendered. Nor need he be given the opportunity to surrender.\"\n \n Is the utility of the Yassin assassination a legitimate subject for debate? Certainly. But can we debate its justice? Only if we are prepared to grant the late Sheikh Yassin legitimacy he in no way deserves. \n\n \n Lot of good posts, I think the best in this thread was the article on the first page regarding the effect of Isreal's targeting of terrorist leaders. Quite an effect... It's an excellent arguement on the utility of assasinations like Yassin's.",

   "\n [Dershowitz] reffered to the classical term of a combatant and that one simply doesn't fit on Yassin.\n\n \n Quite the contrary. The limitations you impose are of your own making. Look again at the quote in Ilana Mercer's column that she attributes to Dershowitz in his book: Under international law and the laws of war, it is entirely legal to target and kill an enemy combatant who has not surrendered.\n \n Your argument that Dershowitz is referring to the \"classical term of a combatant\" appears without basis, as no such reference is expressed or even implied. It's no secret that Dershowitz believes the killing of Yassin was both legal and moral, so why attempt to confine his remarks to a narrow context?\n \n Furthermore, you provide no source or clear indication of what constitutes the classical definition of combatant or even why the classical definition should still be our concern in the 21st century. I assume that international agreement, like the numerous Geneva Conventions dating back to 1864, is your basis for the law of armed conflict. Which convention, treaty, or protocol illustrates the 'classical combatant', in your opinion?\n \n In accordance with international law and the laws of war, the armed conflict between Israel and the Palestinians requires that Israel divide the Palestinian population into two general classes, combatants and noncombatants. The noncombatants are generally synonymous with the civilian population--those individuals who are not members of an armed force and do not otherwise directly support the commission of hostile acts.\n \n With that distinction in mind, and regardless of any notion of 'classical' combatants, Yassin clearly was a combatant by any reasonable definition of the term. He founded a terrorist organization and was active as its leader. His wheelchair confinement was irrelevant to his culpability. There was nothing ambiguous in his personal approval of acts of terrorism against civilians. Indeed, he publicly vowed to continue the terrorism, even if Israel should end the occupation and dismantle all settlements.\n \n A combatant, simply put, is a soldier or guerilla member who is waging war. The qualifiers you cited--that he has to wear a uniform and bear his weapon openly--are not required elements. Even the Geneva Convention suggests that wearing a uniform and carrying a weapon are not determining factors in who may be considered a combatant. Rather, they are simply two of four characteristics used to determine if the combatant is entitled to be protected by the laws of war.\n \n Protocol I of the Convention, Part III, Section II, Article 43 states: The armed forces of a Party to a conflict consist of all organized armed forces, groups and units which are under a command responsible to that Party for the conduct or its subordinates, even if that Party is represented by a government or an authority not recognized by an adverse Party... Members of the armed forces of a Party to a conflict (other than medical personnel and chaplains covered by Article 33 of the Third Convention) are combatants, that is to say, they have the right to participate directly in hostilities.\n \n Hamas is an armed party to the conflict, formerly under the command of Yassin, a godfather of terror, who incited and exhorted his forces to engage in relentless martyrdom operations to kill as many Jews and Israelis as possible--soldiers and civilians alike. Yassin's successor in Gaza, the pediatrician Rantissi, follows closely in the footsteps of his predecessor. Upon taking over the top command of Hamas in Gaza, Rantissi immediately issued a directive to his fighters: \"The door is open for you to strike all places, all the time and using all means.\"\n \n As was Yassin, so is Rantissi a combatant.",
