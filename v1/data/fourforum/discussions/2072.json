I would like you to answer a few questions.\n \n First of all, you stated that since Archaeopteryx had modern feathers it meant that it couldn't be a transitional. Exactly what do you think a transitional is? Why would modern feathers not be an indication that it is a transitional?\n \n Please address the following structures on Archaeopteryx and indicate why the presence/absence is an indication that it is not transitional.\n \n furcula - you already claimed that this meant that Archaeopteryx was not a transitional.

   "This is just to bump this to the top. It seems that astronomyfan missed it since he hasn't responded. I'm sure that he can since it would be foolish to address a topic without fundamental knowledge.\n \n I am especially interested in the answer to my initial remarks, specifically that a range of fossils of maniraptorians have been discovered with primative feathers. Later fossils have more modern feathers. I also commented on the killing claw on Archaeopteryx feet, the tridactyle grasping claws on its wings, its teeth, and the long boney tail. Astronomy chose to ignore all of that and instead remark on the shape of the wings, the shape of the feathers, and the furculum.\n \n It is reasonable that Archaeopteryx had wings typical of a woodland bird, since the geology around Solnhofen indicates that the area was a series of lagoons interspersed with wooded islands.\n \n Now it is true that in modern birds the furcula (that's the wishbone) flexes on the down stroke, thereby storing energy that is used in the upstroke. But creationists have objected strongly to evolutionary claims the the furcula is evidence of transition. Additionally, dinosaurs have been found with fused furcula. If astronomyfan is correct, then this is evidenct that they were strong flyers - after all, they had feathers too.\n \n Let me point out what Pat Shipman says in her book, Taking Wing. 1999, Touchstone, New York.\n \n On page 62 of the paperback (hardcopy was 1998):\n \nThe size and strength of the carina also vary with flight ability, being much smaller in flightless or poorly flighted species and much bigger in powerful flyers. In fact, in flightless birds the carina may be cartilaginous, rather than bony, or even completely absent.\n\n On page 72:\n \nLike the furcula, the carina is apparently of such pivotal importance for flight that every living, flighted bird has one, and no other creature on earth does.\n\n The reason is quite simple. Flighted birds do something called a \"wing flip\". The is the recovery stroke. The supracoracoideus muscle, which originates on the carina and inserts via a tendon on the humerus or upper bone of the wing, when contracted causes the wing to flex and brings the humerus and the rest of the wing into a vertical position above the bird's back to start the down stroke. Of course, the muscles the power the down stroke are also anchored on the carina. In other words, a bird without a large carina was not a powerful flyer.\n \n Archaeopteryx specimens don't have a carina. If one was present, it may have been cartilaginous and thus not preserved. Only the A. bavarica specimen has a dicernable carina.\n \n Now I do know something about birds. I learned something about birds many years ago in a class of ornithology, and I have done some reading since. But I didn't learn that apparent flight feathers mean \"powerful\" flight. My brother-in-law has chickens with beautifully shaped flight feathers, and yet they aren't able to get over a 6 ft. fence. They have both a furcula and a large carina as well as the flight feathers that astronomyfan claims are evidence of a \"powerful\" flyer. And yet they aren't able to get off the ground far enough to clear that fence.\n \n So I'm waiting for astronomyfan to show support his assertions. I'm waiting for his discussion of all of the other structures that I mentioned and why they are predicted by creationism. Maybe he just missed the message.",

Astronomyfan has posted four times in other fora since I asked that he support his assertions.\n \n It seems to me that a response would be a matter of courtesy. Even if he admits that he is ignorant of the points of discussion and needs to do further research.\n\n \n To 7th Arty:\n I was in the process of responding to your post when we had a brown/black out and it shut down my computer. So hence, the message was destroyed. Have you seen Cool Runnings? Remember the words \"I see pride, I see power, I see a bad a**e mother who don't take no **** off no-one!\" Well, I have taken enough from you. You couldn't tell from the way that you post that you are an adult. I could easily mistake you for being a 5 year old. For Heaven Sake, just grow up and start to act your age, not your shoe size! Is this not supposed to be about getting to the truth? Why should I hurry to post a message that you openly mis-interpret and mis-quote, and attack my character, etc? This is examplified in your last post to me in that evolution and moral relativism thread. Now that I have got that you, to the original topic.\n \n My definition of a transitional form is quite simple, it is a supposed \"in-between\" form between two distinct groups of animals, such as reptiles and birds. \n \n You don't really impress me with such a long list of parts of the bird. In fact, I don't know what you are trying to prove. You believe that archaeopteryx is the \"trump\" card, you could not have been more wrong. We are currently arguing over points that has been settled years ago in which many leading evolutionists have come out and said that archaeopteryx is a real bird, a real flying bird. You do obviously not know much about flight and birds, and what there needs to be in place for a bird to fly. Besides the usual stuff needed, such as the wings, feathers, etc, the feather vanes and ventral needs to be asymmetric. In non-flying birds such as the chicken, who can waddle up and back down and are not strong flyers, the vanes and ventral in the feathers are symmetic. So hence, they don't fly to well. But guess what they are in the archaeopteryx? The archaeopteryx has the highly asymmetric vanes and ventral associated with powerful flight. Now does that prove it flew? I don't know, but it is very good evidence to suggest that it did. Alan Feduccia, a a world authority on birds and an evolutionist, in the article \"Evidence from claw geometry indicating arboreal habits of Archaeopteryx\", Science  259(5096):790-793, february 5, 1993 that basically the archaeopteryx has fully formed flying feathers that are associated with powerful flight. \n \n He also quoted: \"Paleontologists have tried to turn archaeopteryx into an earth-bound, feathered dinosaur. But it's not. It is a bird, a perching bird. And no amount of \"paleobabble\" is going to change that.\" in V.Morell, \"Archaeopteryx: Early bird catches a can of worms\", Science 259(59096):764-65, February 5, 1993. I know that this quote has been used before against you, but you are being \"willingly ignorant\". \n \n Now, do tell me, why should I believe you in telling me that archaeopteryx is a earth-bound bird and a transitional form when:\n a. the fossil evidence of archaeopteryx tells me that this was a strong flying true bird? You are going against the very evidence that supposedly is the \"best evidence\" for evolution. \n \n b. your own evolutionary scientists (Ph.D. - which I shall safely assume that you have no such education, if even I a student who doesn't study biology knows more than you on this issue!) state that archaeopteryx is a true flying bird and that the fossil record does not show any evolution what so ever. Things stay true to their kind. They may change via loss or reshuffling of information, but they will never change into another kind of animal, i.e. a dog can't change into a cat, no reptile into bird, etc.\n \n So please tell my why I should believe you? You appear to be asking me to commit logical suicide! I think that you should probably re-assess your position and that of your evolutionary scientists, than may be you can turn this debate into something of a decency. I will not go wasting a whole day looking at those points to reach a conclusion that I already know: archaeopteryx is not a \"transitional form\". It is a true flying bird, as the evidence shows through the fossil. If you want to argue that point, than I would invite you to send a polite letter to the \"editorial team\" at AiG. There they will most likely cut up your argument and eliminate it. They are real scientists who know the issues like the back of their hand. I am just a student in year 12, so if you can't beat me, what chance do you think you have in a debate with Ph.D. scientists? Hmmmm? The AiG editorial address is:\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/Home/Area/feedback/ \n They should reply to your question in a week or two.\n \n Btw, archaeopteryx is not really my strong suit, you should have cleaned me up on this ages ago if you were any good. I am just using reference, some from creationists, but the marjority of the stuff is coming from leading evolutionary scientists themselves!",

   "We are currently arguing over points that has been settled years ago in which many leading evolutionists have come out and said that archaeopteryx is a real bird, a real flying bird.\n\n \n Im kinda bored astron, so i'll deal with each and every one of your points. I hope you wont ignore me like you did on that other thread.\n \n Yes, Archaeopteryx is a bird and could fly. But being a bird does not mean its not a transitional, a confusion thats probably the result of not knowing how systematists define \"birds\". Aves, astron, is the common ancestor of Archaeopteryx and all extant birds plus all descendents (this is synonymous with \"Avialae\" sensu Gauthier). Thus falling within Aves and being a bird is a statement about phylogeny, and NOT NECESSARLY any great similarity to extant forms. I asked this on the other thread and didnt receive a reply, so i'll ask it again to make my point clearer:\n \n Can you name a SINGLE character state possesed by Archaeopteryx but not the most derived non-avian dinosaurs? Can you tell me how the forelimbs of these same dinosaurs differ from Archaeopteryx?\n \n \nYou do obviously not know much about flight and birds, and what there needs to be in place for a bird to fly. Besides the usual stuff needed, such as the wings, feathers, etc, the feather vanes and ventral needs to be asymmetric. In non-flying birds such as the chicken, who can waddle up and back down and are not strong flyers, the vanes and ventral in the feathers are symmetic. So hence, they don't fly to well. But guess what they are in the archaeopteryx? The archaeopteryx has the highly asymmetric vanes and ventral associated with powerful flight.\n\n \n As I mentioned on the other thread, assymmetrical remiges are known in non-avian dinosaurs -- in particular, Microraptor gui and Cryptovolans pauli. And no, asymmetrical remiges are not associated with powerful flight, only with flight generally. Archaeopteryx didnt have a triosseal canal, lacked a larged sternum with carina, the coracoids are not strut-like, no alula, etc. So while Archaeopteryx could fly, it only could do so poorly, being unable to take off from the ground, being unable to fly slowly, and so forth.\n \n \nAlan Feduccia, a a world authority on birds and an evolutionist, in the article \"Evidence from claw geometry indicating arboreal habits of Archaeopteryx\", Science  259(5096):790-793, february 5, 1993 that basically the archaeopteryx has fully formed flying feathers that are associated with powerful flight.\n\n \n Two things. First, ol' Doc Feduccia is not a \"world authority\" -- he's a crank. Just about everything he has written is pure BS, with a few exceptions. He's part of an extremely vocal fringe that the VAST majority of competant scholars will have nothing to do with.\n \n Second, the paper you cited is not about the asymmetry of its feathers. Had you taken the time to read the paper (heck, if you had looked at the TITLE of the paper), you'd know that Feduccia 1993 is about claw curvature. Feduccia's paper with Tordoff deals with that. The cite is:\n \n Feduccia, A. & Tordoff, H.B. 1979. Asymmetric vanes indicate aerodynamic function. Science 203: 1021-1022.\n \n I'd be more than happy to forward you PDF copies so you can familarize yourself with the actual data.\n \n \nHe also quoted: \"Paleontologists have tried to turn archaeopteryx into an earth-bound, feathered dinosaur. But it's not. It is a bird, a perching bird. And no amount of \"paleobabble\" is going to change that.\" in V.Morell, \"Archaeopteryx: Early bird catches a can of worms\", Science 259(59096):764-65, February 5, 1993. I know that this quote has been used before against you, but you are being \"willingly ignorant\". \n\n \n Golly, if Alan Feduccia said that, birds must really be unrelated to dinosaurs!\n \n \nNow, do tell me, why should I believe you in telling me that archaeopteryx is a earth-bound bird and a transitional form when:\n\n \n Who said it was a obligate cursor? How is that relevant at all?\n \n \na. the fossil evidence of archaeopteryx tells me that this was a strong flying true bird? You are going against the very evidence that supposedly is the \"best evidence\" for evolution.\n\n \n See above. \n \n \nb. your own evolutionary scientists (Ph.D. - which I shall safely assume that you have no such education, if even I a student who doesn't study biology knows more than you on this issue!) state that archaeopteryx is a true flying bird and that the fossil record does not show any evolution what so ever. \n\n \n Just to be crystal clear astron, even Feduccia believes Archaeopteryx is a transitional fossil. Even he believes it is little like extant birds. Dont believe me? Let us see what he says on the VERY FIRST PAGE of both of his books (The Age of Birds and The Origin and Evolution of Birds):\n \n \"The Archaeopteryx fossil is, in fact, the most superb example of a specimen perfectly intermediate between two higher groups of living organisms - what has come to be called a \"missing link\", a Rosetta stone of evolution. Its discovery in 1861, just two years after publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859), seemed an unparalleled act of cosmic good will toward science, for by fulfilling the Darwinian expectation that such intermediate forms existed, this one fossil had a profound influence on the ultimate acceptance of the concept of evolution through natural selection.\"\n \n Let me sum up. Astron has made irrelevant points (Archaeopteryx was arboreal or scansorial...so what? Archaeopteryx had assymetrical remiges...yes, and so did non-avian dinosaurs), false points (Archaeopteryx was a strong flier? Not bloody likely!), quote-mined (Feduccia opposes the theropod origin of birds, not the transitional status of Archaeopteryx or its evolution in general), and misrepresented studies.\n \n Maybe you would like to try addressing the OP, which im actually very interested in seeing you do?",

Kind of hard would you not concurr? I'm not quite sure what point you are trying to make here. But anyway, lets move on. Not that I'm disputing your point (I wouldn't know) about aves being the common ancestor of archaeopteryx and \"extant birds\", (whatever they are) plus all the descendents, but I would like to ask you something. How do you know that for sure? Were you there? \n \n \nCan you name a SINGLE character state possesed by Archaeopteryx but not the most derived non-avian dinosaurs? Can you tell me how the forelimbs of these same dinosaurs differ from Archaeopteryx?\n \n As I have said before, I do not do biology at school. I am more interested in the real science subjects such as physics and chemistry where you have mathematics and experiments involved and there shouldn't be any philosophical views driving the subjects. So I have no real idea what you are on about - but snoop around and you may be able to find something.\n \n \nAs I mentioned on the other thread, assymmetrical remiges are known in non-avian dinosaurs -- in particular, Microraptor gui and Cryptovolans pauli. And no, asymmetrical remiges are not associated with powerful flight, only with flight generally. Archaeopteryx didnt have a triosseal canal, lacked a larged sternum with carina, the coracoids are not strut-like, no alula, etc. So while Archaeopteryx could fly, it only could do so poorly, being unable to take off from the ground, being unable to fly slowly, and so forth.\n \n \n You once again appear to be contradicting yourself. You firstly state that archaeopteryx \"could fly\" but than you state that it would be \"unable to take off from the ground\" and than you finally contradict yourself again when you say it was \"unable to fly slowly\". This being the case, did it fly fast then? Three different views on the one bird! Wow! Now I am impressed. So which view do you take? Well you are totally wrong about archaeopteryx being a poor flying bird.\n \n Just some general information on types of dinosaurs and archaeopteryx:\n There are two types of dinosaurs, lizard hipped called Saurischian, and bird hipped and than among the bird hipped called Ornithischian. Among the bird hipped dinosaurs there are bird hipped, bird footed dinosaurs. So you think hey, these evolutionists are onto something here. You have bird hipped, bird footed dinosaurs, over there you have lizard hipped, lizard footed dinosaurs. The evolutionists believe that the birds evolved from the lizard hipped, not the bird hipped. Sometimes you will hear a play on \"see how similar the pubic bones are on the dinosaurs and the birds\". But that exhibit won't say that yes, but this is not the group that birds are believed to have evolved from.\n \n Archaeopteryx is a bird, and ornithologists consider it a bird. But the dinosaur people really think of it as more of a reptile. So we have two different groups of evolutionists those who are ornithologists and those who are experts in dinosaurs. By on large ornithologists say \"Hey it's a bird, an unusual bird\" while the dinosaur people say \"No it's a dinosaur with feathers\". There are many features of archaeopteryx that is bird like: the skull is basically bird like, it has a perching foot as you would expect from a bird, it has clavicles in the front, the wish bone. There are some unusual features, this bird had teeth, had a long tail (most birds have a very short tail) that had feathers on it, there were ligaments between the vertebrate that held it very stiffly. \n \n Finally, all we have to do to determine if a bird was a powerful flyer or a weak flyer is just look at one feather from a wing and you have a very powerful clue. If it is from a powerful flyer than the feather vanes will be asymmetric, i.e. the vane on one side of the shaft will be considerably larger than the vane on the other side. If you take a feather from a chicken which toddles a little bit in the air and back down again, or a bird that really doesn't fly at all you will notice that the feather vanes are symmetrical, i.e. one side is pretty much the same as the other - and that holds up pretty well. Guess what feather archaeopteryx had that many evolutionists say, \"Okay, okay it's a bird but it doesn't fly\", it had the highly asymmetric feather associated with powerful flight, and hence, this is powerful evidence to suggest that the bird flew.\n \n I'm not quite sure that I believe when you talk about asymmetrical not being associated with powerful flight, as Dr David Menton and many other scientists appear to say the total opposite. I got some of the above information from a lecture done by Dr Menton on the AiG \"Project 3:15\" CD. This appears to be in direct contrast with what you are saying, I think that he too knows what he is talking about. He is a human anatomist who has a special interest in the so-called \"bird evolution\". Well, then, what makes a powerful flyer? I found an interesting exert from an internet site regarding the dinosaur cryptovolan::\n &#8220;Cryptovolans (Microraptor???) was a fully developed flier. There are very large, strongly asymmetrical primary wing feathers anchored on the hand, with some smaller feathers attached to the distal leading edge of digit II in the avian manner. Such asymmetry occurs only when feathers are adapted to generate thrust and/or lift, there are no exceptions.&#8221;\n This comes from the internet site:\n http://hometown.aol.com/strigoivv/FeathersOfDinosaursII.html \n Hey, this just backed up my point about asymmetric vanes = powerful flight. \n \n More information on your bird:\n \"Cryptovolans is sometimes called the &#8220;flying dinosaur&#8221;, since it probably could fly.\n When you look at the reconstruction, everything is Archaeopteryx-like, only better. The breastbone is like those of modern birds, and the ribs articulate with it. The ribs have braces between them, as in birds.\n The only problem with classifying Cryptovolans as a bird is the dinosaur-like skull. Is a faulty reconstruction to blame? Can&#8217;t say for sure, and to proclaim a reconstruction or a hoax would be rash and premature. Of course a hoax cannot be ruled out.\n The problem is, if Cryptovolans is a dinosaur it is more birdlike than Archaeopteryx. Therefore it cannot be said to be the ancestor of birds.\n Because of this, Cryptovolans is not used as evidence that dinosaurs evolved into birds, but rather that birds evolved into dinosaurs.\"\n \n Now who is presenting the faulty information? Saying that archaeopteryx cannot \"get off the ground\" or was a poor flyer? It was indeed most likely a good flyer as the fossil evidence (asymmetric vanes) suggests. If I did present any faulty information, I did so unknowningly. But I have not presented any faulty information (unless you can give me an example). The above came from:\n http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/megaraptor/cryptovolans_and_the_birds_to_di.htm \n \n \nFirst, ol' Doc Feduccia is not a \"world authority\" -- he's a crank. \n \n And you can talk? Do you have his education level? Do you know as much on the topic as he does?\n \n \nI'd be more than happy to forward you PDF copies so you can familiarize yourself with the actual data.\n \n Yeah, in fact, I wouldn't mind having a quick read, if you will. Thanking you in advance.\n \n \nJust to be crystal clear astron, even Feduccia believes Archaeopteryx is a transitional fossil. Even he believes it is little like extant birds. \n \n I didn't say that Feduccia didn't believe in bird evolution. Even if archaeopteryx is a transitional form, then where are the others? David B. Kitts, Ph.D. in zoology, (School of Geology and Geophysics, Department of the History of Science, University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, USA) says this on the topic of missing links:\n \"Despite the bright promise that palaeontology provides a means of \"seeing\" evolution, it has presented some nasty difficulties for evolutionists the most notorious of which the present of \"gaps\" in the fossil record. Evolution requires intermediate forms between species and palaeontology does not provide them. The gaps must therefore be a contingent feature of the record.\" \"Palaeontology and evolutionary theory\". Evolution, vol. 28, September 1974, p. 467.\n \n Barbara J. Stahl from St Anselm's College, USA) in \"Vertebrate History: Problems in evolution\", (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1974, pp. 349 and 350) states the following on bird evolution:\n \"It is not difficult to imagine how feathers, once evolved, assumed additional functions, but how they arose initially, presumably from reptilian scales, defies analysis.....\" \"The problem has been set a side, not for want of interest, but for lack of evidence. No fossil structure transitional between scale and feather is known, and recent investigators are unwilling to found a theory on pure speculation.....\" \"It seems, from the complex construction of feathers, that their evolution from reptilian scales would have required an immense period of time and involved a series of intermediate structures. So far, the fossil record does not bear out that supposition.\"\n And the situation has not changed in 30 years as far as the condition surrounding the fossil record is concerned.\n \n \nArchaeopteryx had asymmetrical remiges...yes, and so did non-avian dinosaurs), false points (Archaeopteryx was a strong flier? Not bl**dy likely!),\n \n Who is to say that you are right in your interpretation? There is good evidence that asymmetrical vanes = powerful flight. Most scientists now agree that archaeopteryx was a flying bird. Go ahead and type in archaeopteryx and see how many internet sites you get in which they will say that archaeopteryx was most likely a flying bird - and the evidence supports this.\n \n \nMaybe you would like to try addressing the OP, which im actually very interested in seeing you do\n \n This is my holidays man. I don't really wanting to do research on some extinct bird that has no effect on my life, but, I guess that I'll do it over the course of the next two weeks. You have actually not presented any real evidence that dismisses any of my ideas or opinions. So I'll answer the question, but I would also like you to provide me with the best evidence you can get on archaeopteryx and why it is a transitional formand I read it (without bias) and see if you can change my mind on the issue. Expect a reply from me in a few days. I need to spend some time away from the computer. Good day...",

This is one topic that I feel rather passionately about. From now on I will one post my opinion than 1 rebuttal to any reply to defend myself from criticism - should I need to. Then I won't send another reply. It seems safer that way as I often get the feeling that evolutionists don't like hearing what creationists like to say and they always appear - from observation - to call it a post full of lies/mis this and mis that.

   "Firstly you say that archaeopteryx is a bird, than in the next sentence you hint that it might not be a bird. It either is, or it isn't a bird, you can't have it both ways. If it is a bird, than how can it be a \"half-bird-half-reptile\" creature and a bird at the same time? Kind of hard would you not concurr?\n\n \n Sorry Matt, there is no contradiction here, and no, I do not concur. I'll try to explain it very simply. Lets suppose this line:\n \n [------------------------] \n \n represents a geneology of dinosaurs. At the left end it the common ancestor of the group. At the other, modern birds. Anything that falls on the line, or branches off from it is called a dinosaur. This is what I said before: names of groups -- \"dinosaurs\" and \"birds\" -- are statements of evolutionary relationships. They do not reflect immutable platonic types. \n \n Birds, on the other hand..\n \n [--------------------[----]\n \n are any forms that fall within that smaller subdivison of Dinosauria. So, while any form (including Archaeopteryx) that shares a common ancestor with Archaeopteryx and Passer is a \"bird\", those lying toward the bracket on the left are not necessarly going to be very bird-like. Possesing just ONE tiny, insignificant bit of anatomy can place you in this group. Indeed, Archaeopteryx posseses just three \"birdy-traits\" to the exclusion of non-avian dinosaurs!\n \n Archaeopteryx is a bird by definition. Its a dinosaur in the same sense that primates are mammals. Its a transitional because of its very unbirdlike osteology.\n \n \nNot that I'm disputing your point (I wouldn't know) about aves being the common ancestor of archaeopteryx and \"extant birds\", (whatever they are) \n\n \n Living birds?\n \n \nplus all the descendents, but I would like to ask you something. How do you know that for sure?\n\n \n Phylogeny is constructed according to shared, derived similarity, most often using parsimony (cladistics). I wasnt there, and I dont need to have been. On the other hand, \"Aves\" is Archaeopteryx + Neornithes because its DEFINED that way. Being a member of the latter depends on the former.\n \n \nYou once again appear to be contradicting yourself. You firstly state that archaeopteryx \"could fly\" but than you state that it would be \"unable to take off from the ground\" and than you finally contradict yourself again when you say it was \"unable to fly slowly\"\n\n \n There is no contradiction between \"is able to fly\" and \"is unable to fly slowly and take off from the ground\" Matt. \n \n \nThis being the case, did it fly fast then?\n\n \n Yes, it did. And as for the second point, it would have taken off from trees or other high places. See? No contradiction.\n \n \nThree different views on the one bird!\n\n \n Wrongo.\n \n \nWell you are totally wrong about archaeopteryx being a poor flying bird.\n\n \n Let me tell you a little about the biomechanics of flight Matt. Bird wingbeat kinematics have two \"gaits\", analogous to the locomotory gaits of terrestrial animals -- The \"vortex ring gait\" and the \"continuous vortext gait\". The vortext ring gait is universally used in slow flight by all birds and more often used by those with wings of lower aspect ratios. The upstroke is not used aerodynamically to generate lift, with creates a wake of nearly circular vortex rings. On the other hand, the CVG uses the upstroke is aerodynamically active, with lift itself being used to raise the wing. It is used at fast (or cruising) speeds because when going slower, it is energetically inefficent to use the upstroke for lift. Although it acts as negative thrust, they avoid the costs of stopping and starting lift generation at the beginning and end of each downstroke.\n \n The major difference, anatomically, between these two gaits is musculature. Birds that use the VRG regularly or habitually always have a relativly large M. supracoracoideus muscle and the related osteology -- namely, a triosseal canal and carinate sternum. This is because, unlike the CVG which raises the wings with lift, these birds must do so with their muscles. Birds that fly fastly can use lift to elevate their wings, and thus have less use for the supracoracoideus. Consequently, its more reduced.\n \n So here is the point. Archaeopteryx had no triosseal canal and no carinate sternum, which means it lacked the derived supracoracoideus required by the VRG. If it was going to fly, it was going to be at speeds (namely 6-8 m/s) sufficent to allow lift to elevate the wing, which means, essentially, it wasnt going to get a running start and needed a gravity assist. In addition, we know from supracoracoideus denervation and tenotomy that the vast majority of birds are unable to make a grounded takeoff without it. Those that continue to do so use an increased burst duration from the derived deltoid musculature, which again, Archaeopteryx didnt have. However, you can pick them up and drop them and they fly just fine.\n \n Feduccia agrees with me, by the way. He calls Archaeopteryx capability \"primitive powered flight\" and \"an early stage in the evolution of powered fight\" (1999, pg. 136 and 137). He agrees that it was no skilled arealist and that it could not take off from the ground. You, Matt, are the one inaccurately claiming the opposite.\n \n Powered flight is a complicated and intricate process that requires the coordination of bones, muscles and other structures. Simply sticking remiges on a creature doesnt mean it will be able to fly UNLESS is also has the rest of the required anatomy. A feathered elephant is no flier Matt. A feathered mouse isnt going to power his way into the clouds because he just doesnt have the proper bones or muscles. And in a similar way, Archaeopteryx isnt going to swoop around like a modern bird. He isnt built for it.\n \n \nThere are two types of dinosaurs, lizard hipped called Saurischian, and bird hipped and than among the bird hipped called Ornithischian. Among the bird hipped dinosaurs there are bird hipped, bird footed dinosaurs. So you think hey, these evolutionists are onto something here. You have bird hipped, bird footed dinosaurs, over there you have lizard hipped, lizard footed dinosaurs. The evolutionists believe that the birds evolved from the lizard hipped, not the bird hipped. Sometimes you will hear a play on \"see how similar the pubic bones are on the dinosaurs and the birds\". But that exhibit won't say that yes, but this is not the group that birds are believed to have evolved from.\n\n \n Im quite familar with dinosaur systematics, thank you. And no, no one claims the ornithischian pelvic girdle is similar to birds. It's only superfically so, as its opistopubic. The pelvis of the most derived non-avian theropods, however, is nearly identical to birds. In some ways, they're often more bird-like than Archaeopteryx itself!\n \n \nArchaeopteryx is a bird, and ornithologists consider it a bird. But the dinosaur people really think of it as more of a reptile\n\n \n I dont know a single person that doubt thats birds are reptiles Matt. Both ornithologists and \"the dinosaur people\" consider it both. Name me a dinosaur paleontologist who denies Archaeopteryx is a bird (and not Thulborn, because he no longer believes that). Name me an ornithologist who doubts Archaeopteryx is a reptile of SOME sort.\n \n \nSo we have two different groups of evolutionists those who are ornithologists and those who are experts in dinosaurs. By on large ornithologists say \"Hey it's a bird, an unusual bird\" while the dinosaur people say \"No it's a dinosaur with feathers\".\n\n \n This is just wrong. There is no \"ornithological\" and \"dinosaur paleontology\" view. The vast majority of ornithologists agree that, yes, birds are dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx is the most basal bird. Dinosaur paleontologists accept the same thing almost without exception.\n \n While the critics of theropod origins ARE drawn from ornithology (Feduccia, Olson, Martin, Tarsitano), they are, as I said before, a fringe minority and do not represent the concensus in either field.\n \n About \"just a bird\", refer to above.\n \n \nthe skull is basically bird like\n\n \n LOL! How's that, Matt?\n \n \nit has a perching foot as you would expect from a bird\n\n \n M. zhaoianus has an anisodactyl pes too, and the one possesed by Archaeopteryx is 1) situated high relative to the other metatarsals, and 2) is not reversed a full 180 degrees, which means it wasnt very good at perching. Indeed, Archaeopteryx represents a, get this, transitional stage in the evolution of perching!. Oopsie!\n \n \nit has clavicles in the front, the wish bone.\n\n \n Wow, a furcula? Doesnt every neotetanuran (including big ol' T. rex) have a wishbone? If you're going to tell me how its just a modern bird, Matt, you're going to have to give me characters that arent also possesed by dinosaurs!\n \n \nThere are some unusual features, this bird had teeth, had a long tail (most birds have a very short tail) that had feathers on it, there were ligaments between the vertebrate that held it very stiffly.\n\n \n Ignoring all the ways in which Archaeopteryx is plesiomorphic (\"primitive\") relative to other birds is the standard creationist tactic. I will repeat my uncomprehensive list of ways in which Archaeopteryx is very unlike modern birds:\n \n -Quadrate without prootic articulation\n -Quadrate without large orbital process\n -Quadrate without propulson joint with pterygoid\n -Ectopterygoid present\n -Rentention of descending process of the squamosal\n -Squamosal-postorbital contact\n -Complete lacrimal-jugal bar\n -Lack of rhamphotheca\n -Centra not heterocoelus\n -No ossifed uncinate processes\n -Gastralia present\n -Pygostyle absent\n -Acrocoracoid incipient\n -No ossifed sternal ribs\n -Unossified eutachian tubes\n -No cranial deflection of deltopectoral crest\n -Humerus lacks pnumatic foramen perforating its shaft\n -First sacral not heterocoelous\n -Low sacral count (five or six..modern birds have more than ten all fused into a synacrum)\n -No ulnar quill knobs\n -Pelvic girdle unfused\n -Pubis only mildly opistopubic (110 degree or so relative to the long axis of the ilium)\n -Carpometacarpus absent\n -No bowing of MT IV\n -No flange on the proximal phalanx of digit III\n -Hypopubic cup absent\n -Tibiotarsus absent\n -Extensor canal on tibiotarsus absent\n -Caudal maxillary sinus not cup-like\n -No alula\n -Standard theropod phalangeal forumla (no reduction in phalanx number)\n -Pes not fully anisodactyl (that is, reverted 180% relative to the forward facing digits)\n -Tarsometatarus absent\n \n Now compare this to the ways in which Archaeopteryx was like a bird: a prominent acromion of the scapula, caudal margin of the naris extends farther rostal than the rostral boarder of the antorbital fossa, and a postacetabular process of the ilium that is twice as long as the postacetabular process. These THREE tiny bits of anatomy make Archaeopteryx more bird-like than the most derived non-avian dinosaurs, Matt. THREE! This is your \"modern bird\".\n \n \nIf you take a feather from a chicken which toddles a little bit in the air and back down again, or a bird that really doesn't fly at all you will notice that the feather vanes are symmetrical, i.e. one side is pretty much the same as the other - and that holds up pretty well\n\n \n Uhh, no. Galliformes have asymmetrical feathers, Matt.\n \n I'll finish the rest of this silliness later.",

Its got some great molecular support (e.g. Harris et al 2002), as well as fossil support. There are transitional structures, as per Prum's hypothesis, found in the fossil record. For example, the stage 1 feathers in Sinosauropteryx, the stage 1 and 2 in Shuvuuia, the stage 3 in Beipiaosaurus and NGMC 91, etc.\n \n By quoting that you're attacking a strawman -- an idea well-informed scientists have firmly rejected, and for good reason.\n \n More later.",
