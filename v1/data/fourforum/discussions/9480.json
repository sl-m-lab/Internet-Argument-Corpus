   "From the NY Times:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/world/europe/23briefs-italypatients.html\n \n January 23, 2007\n World Briefing | Europe\n Italy: Cardinal Says Patients Should Have Right to Die \n By AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n In a letter in an Italian newspaper on Sunday, Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the influential former archbishop of Milan, urged the Vatican to allow terminally ill patients who ask \"in all lucidity\" the right to withdraw life-sustaining medical treatment. Cases like that of Piergiorgio Welby, a muscular dystrophy patient who sought to have himself removed from the respirator that had kept him alive for years, \"will be more frequent,\" said the 79-year-old cardinal, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, and the \"church should be more attentive to them, notably at the pastoral level.\" \n \n He said that while the distinction between euthanasia, which the Vatican rigidly opposes, and the refusal of excessive care is sometimes unclear, \"the wishes of the patient cannot be ignored.\" \n \n Mr. Welby died last month when a doctor in Rome unplugged his respirator. He had been unable to end his life legally because there was no law permitting it. The Diocese of Rome then denied permission for a church funeral.",

Here is an up-to-the-minute case of an incipient shift in a previously 'absolute' moral position. Why?

We saw this with attitudes to premarital sex and cohabitation in the 1960s and 70s: what had previously been labelled 'living in sin' and vigorously condemned had become so widespread that its tacit acceptance as normal, acceptable behaviour was inevitable.

It does define a moral position as relative. That would be the opposite of absolute. It does define it. Simply saying that it does not define it does not make it so. You make a claim that goodness or badness is determined realtive to the individual. YOu must be claiming this as you cannot claim the negative of absolute without also claiming the affirmative of relative.\n \n Pick a situation where there are only two alternatives. A good example is whether or not something exists. By saying that it does not \"not exist\" you are necessarily implying that it does.\n \n There are only two alternatives in this case. Things are either absolute or relative. No other possibilities exist. to say no to one and say but I am not affirming the other is simply ludricrous.\n \n You are not saying the position is good or bad to have. That is true. But you are affirming the existence of one and the non existence of the other. In this case by stating the existence of \"only relativities\" you are making an absolute statement. If you want to do it in the negative that is fine (a bit wierd for a logic statement but in this case it works) but either using \"no\" or \"only\" are simply terms of \"absolutism\" no matter how you shake it.

These are serious questions, as I have no idea what the answers are.\n\n I've been a long time getting round to this one, largely because I have no idea what the answers are either.\n \n What I would defend is the idea that 'moral revolutions' like the changed attitudes to pre-marital sex since the 1960s don't 'just happen' but are triggered by some tangible change in social circumstances: in this case the arrival in the form of the pill of reliable contraception under the full control of the female partner. Were more unmarried people having sex in 1968 than in 1958? In this country I suspect so, though I don't have statistical evidence to hand. Were they having more than in 1944? Almost certainly not: some fascinating recent interviews with WWII survivors reveal that attitudes to sexual morality had undergone a radical (if temporary) liberalisation in wartime.",

It can be demonstrated that any 'moral' values change from society to society. It does not make a judgement on if those 'morals' are good/bad or indifferent. It just shows the observation that morality is different in each society, and therefore the conclusion can be drawn there are no 'absolute' morals.",

   "When identifying a self-defeating statement, great care must be exercised in making sure that the statement actually refers to itself, that it is a part of its own subject matter. For example, the claim that one cannot utter a word of English is not self-defeating if the claim is asserted in French. More importantly, though it is false, the statement \"there are no moral absolutes\" is not self-defeating. Why? The statement is a philosophical assertion about morality and not a claim of morality. To be a claim of morality, an assertion must be a moral rule such as \"do not kill,\" \"abortion is wrong,\" or \"one ought to be tolerant of others.\" While \"it's wrong to judge the moral beliefs and behaviors of others\" is a moral rule, \"there are no moral absolutes\" is not itself a moral rule. Like a statement made in English about all French statements (for example, \"no French statement is longer than three words\"), \"there are no moral absolutes\" is false. But since it is not included in its own subject matter, it does not refer to itself; and since it does not refer to itself, it is not self -defeating.\n http://boundless.org/features/a0000942.html\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.P._Moreland",

Were more unmarried people having sex in 1968 than in 1958? In this country I suspect so, though I don't have statistical evidence to hand. Were they having more than in 1944?

   "When identifying a self-defeating statement, great care must be exercised in making sure that the statement actually refers to itself, that it is a part of its own subject matter. For example, the claim that one cannot utter a word of English is not self-defeating if the claim is asserted in French. More importantly, though it is false, the statement \"there are no moral absolutes\" is not self-defeating. Why? The statement is a philosophical assertion about morality and not a claim of morality. To be a claim of morality, an assertion must be a moral rule such as \"do not kill,\" \"abortion is wrong,\" or \"one ought to be tolerant of others.\" While \"it's wrong to judge the moral beliefs and behaviors of others\" is a moral rule, \"there are no moral absolutes\" is not itself a moral rule. Like a statement made in English about all French statements (for example, \"no French statement is longer than three words\"), \"there are no moral absolutes\" is false. But since it is not included in its own subject matter, it does not refer to itself; and since it does not refer to itself, it is not self -defeating.\n http://boundless.org/features/a0000942.html\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.P._Moreland\n\n \n \n Since I have been specifically asked to respond to this here are the major arguments:\n \n This argument shows that relativistic morality is self-contradictory. There are no other alternatives to absolute morality because there is no other kind of morality, but no morality at all, just feelings, or conventions, or consensus, or games, or social approval. Absolute morality is saying something like three-sided triangle. If it isn't three sided, it isn't a triangle.\n \n and\n \n The last argument is the practical self-contradictory argument. This argument finds a self-contradiction in a relativist's practice. Relativists try convincing us that relativism is true. But that is exactly the problem. They suggest that relativism is really right and absolutism really wrong. This is what absolutism is. They assert an absolute. They also condemn actions, which show that they appeal to an absolute.\n \n A fine example is the issue of slavery. We may say that slavery was right and the time and is now wrong if we concede to moral relativism (the only alternative to moral absolutes by the way). If that is the case then why have some demanded reparations for such things as slavery. Why are there reparations at all? If it was okay to the Nazis to kill jews why did we intervene? It was okay relative to that culture at that time.\n \n The point is that you have only two choices moral absolutes or moral relativism which is no morals at all because anyone anywhere can determine what their morals are at any given time for any reason. Therefore it is selfcontradicting.\n \n Huck\n \n PS as stated before, I will not respond further.\n \n Edit: CS lewis has several books as does John Rawls in his A Theory of Justice. The philosopher Immanuel Kant was a promoter of moral absolutism. In the Objectivism of Ayn Rand, absolutism is a subset of \"moral objectivism.\" The philosopher Plato and his student, Aristotle, also believed in universalism, opposing the moral relativism of the Sophists.",

Being relativistic; however, one cannot make absolute statements without being absolute, which is diametrically opposed to relativism...and so forth and so on..\n \n Now consider: \"All scientists are liars.\" By itself the statement is innocuous enough.

First, it's not always obvious how much good or harm an action does, and to how many. For example, the death penalty certainly harms the person being executed but could induce others to not engage in violent crimes, so net harm done is debateable. The second issue is that people have shown a great willingness to classify certain categories of people as being less than full people. Africans were classified as less than human, so enslaving them didn't count as hurting people. \n \n So, is there any simple moral statement, like \"murder is wrong\", that you can't find some exception to? No, probably not. But I do think that that and other moral statements do stem from a common inviolate principle, \"helping good, hurting bad\". And while the application of that principle may not be straight forward, none the less it has been the root of morality for quite some time.",

This is as close as you'll ever get to a moral absolute, though as membership of the in-group is flexible I don't see it as a very impressive one.\n\n While the in-group qualification is quite real, and important, it isn't explicit, it's not part of the actual principle. It's more of an excuse people come up with as a dodge around morality. People know, to a greater of lesser degree, that the \"don't hurt, help\" rule should be universal. But they often want to ignore that rule, for their own benefit. That is, after all, why we need morals, to keep us from putting our own desires first all the time. And so, as you point out, people have often only applied the moral principle to a select group. But if we look at those who have been considered moral paragons, like Jesus or Ghandi, part of their message has been that morals should apply equally to everyone, even enemies. So I would argue that the size of the group you're willing to act morally towards is a sign of your moral progress, the larger the group the better.\n \n \n\n I've already argued several times that \"murder is wrong\" is a literally useless example because it's tautological: wrongness is built into the definition of murder.

Everyone knows that killing people is wrong, in and of itself, but there can be situations where the killing can lead to a greater good, and thus be morally allowable. The \"moral algebra\" involved can be quite tricky, given that defining exactly how bad or good an action isn't easy, and thus we end up with people using the same basic principle but ending up with different conclusions. This isn't to say that having a central principle is useless. On the contrary, if we recognize what the central principle is it provides a better focus for the debate.",

I am not arguing that you cannot say there is no absolute goodness. You may say it certainly, but you will have one monstrous time proving it. I can say \"I am absolutely the best hockey player who ever lived\". I will be proven wrong, but there is nothing in my statement that is self contradictory. However, the statement \"there are no absolutes\" is PATENTLY SELF CONTRADICTORY!!!! Can ye not see that the statement is an absolute!!!

If one can define any other point of view, it would be enlightening. \n \n Now knowing that one might not in good faith make a statement contrary to one's belief:\n \n \"There are no moral absolutes.\" What does this statement do? It renders an opinion on matters moral. If you cannot follow this, I am afraid that there is not much I can do. I feel as though I am in a game of pictionary furiously pointing at a picture of a car whilst the multitude shouts \"tree!\". \n \n Now, those who opine on matters moral necessarily come from the aforementioned diametrically opposed camps. These camps may make any number of absolute statements; however, the point is not whether there can or cannot be absolute statements made. The point is can THIS particular statement be made by an individual who must fall in one set of diametrically opposed beliefs? To determine this you must consider the person making the statement. \n \n Consider the following absolute \"All republicans are wrong.\" Now that is an absolute statement and I do not question the fact that a Democrat may make this statement; however, were a republican to make the same statement, it would be self-contradictory. If all republicans were proven empirically wrong, the statement would be true, which meant that the republican was right; however, this would negate the statement. If one republican was found somewhere who was proven empirically correct, the absolute statement would again fall.\n \n I fear that I can only resort to wild gestures and underlining if the above fails to persuade.",
