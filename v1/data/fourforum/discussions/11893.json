   "This was from January of 2008.\n \n YouTube - SHOCK Audio Unearthed OBAMA TELLS SAN FRANCISCO HE WILL BANKRUPT THE COAL INDUSTRY\n \n \"Let me sort of describe my overall policy.\n \n What I've said is that we would put a cap and trade system in place that is as aggressive, if not more aggressive, than anybody else's out there.\n \n I was the first to call for a 100% auction on the cap and trade system, which means that every unit of carbon or greenhouse gases emitted would be charged to the polluter. That will create a market in which whatever technologies are out there that are being presented, whatever power plants that are being built, that they would have to meet the rigors of that market and the ratcheted down caps that are being placed, imposed every year.\n \n So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can; it's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.\n \n That will also generate billions of dollars that we can invest in solar, wind, biodiesel and other alternative energy approaches.\n \n The only thing I've said with respect to coal, I haven't been some coal booster. What I have said is that for us to take coal off the table as a ideological matter as opposed to saying if technology allows us to use coal in a clean way, we should pursue it.\"\n \n Here is some more of what he said in San Francisco too:\n http://hotair.com/archives/2008/11/0...ces-skyrocket/\n \n \"You know, when I was asked earlier about the issue of coal, uh, you know - Under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket. Even regardless of what I say about whether coal is good or bad. Because I'm capping greenhouse gases, coal power plants, you know, natural gas, you name it - whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, uh, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers.\"\n \n \n Hmmm....\n \n I really don't see that going over so well. I personally see:\n \n 1. Bankrupting companies and leading to a sudden drop off of companies providing electricity leaving millions in the dark, or\n \n 2. Those companies hiking their prices and passing it off to the customer - that precious middle class person Obama claims he wants to protect and help out, causing even more economic difficulties for America. Or,\n \n 3. Companies reduce production so they are charged less, leading to drop in supply eading to rolling brownouts, etc. Or,\n \n 4. A combination of the three.",

You do realize it would cost trillions more to develop other renewables to get them even close to where nuclear is now let alone get above that (which make 1% of our current energy - most of that being biomass) than it would to continue developing nuclear (which is already at around 20% of our power).\n \n Also, nuclear has a much smaller footprint than ther major renewable sources. For example, a nuclear power plant prodicing 1,000 megawatts would take up around 1/3 of a square mile. A solar array producing the same output would take up about 50 acres, and a wind farm of comparable output would take up around 200 acres. \n \n One wonders why some environmentalists would be so against nuclear energy when it destroys far far less environment than solar or wind (which as well are not carbon neutral)",

Please note that the construction workers for new nuclear plants would get their salaries from the taxable payments made toward contractor's revenue and Obama's SS would get their's directly from your pocket.\n \n In addition to nuclear power plants, we should be building huge nuclear powered ships for cargo, passenger and military use.\n \n Obama plans to cripple the coal industry despite the fact that clean burning technology is available. He will fight our drilling for US oil in order to appease his OPEC friends. What he can't seem to do is walk and chew gum at the same time. We need to drill right now, we need to build nuclear plants right now, we need to advance the clean burning coal technology right now, we need to promote wind power right now, we need to research better bio-fuels right now...we need to do all of these things and get away from Middle Eastern oil.",
