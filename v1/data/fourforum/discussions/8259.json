Now I understand I can't prove to you that God doesn't exists, however you cannot prove to me that he does in fact exists.

   "I was raised Catholic. I went through all the rites through confirmation. I went to religious instruction every Saturday morning for 4 hours (8-12). I truly did believe in god at that time. But....I also came to the realization that I might possibly be one of those abominations because I was kind of different from all the other boys. I prayed and begged god every night before bed to please help me be more like the other boys. I got nothing except an increase in the bullying and harrassment. This was the start of my doubting whether there really was a god.\n \n Then I studied the Holocaust. After hearing how busy god was burning and killing entire cities of people for the attempted rape of two angels back in the bad old days I found it amazing that he sat back while millions of people were murdered/burned by a 'Christian Nation.' I don't care if Hitler was Christian or not, Germany IS and WAS a Christian nation and all those Christians were out in the streets saluting Hitler, so they supported him and believed in what he was doing! It's funny, other than putting a stain on a window here in Clearwater Florida a few years ago that looked like 'Mary,' god hasn't done much of anything since education came along (and camera's/video equipment that could actually record all of gods wonderful miracles). So it seems like all the fantastic stories from the old days are just that....stories.\n \n I don't think I was asking for much when I was a kid, and god did absolutely nothing, nada, zip!!!!

Many of their crosses are on a hillside overlooking Normandy Beach. That sort of puts your arguments in a pretty failed light, as far as I can see. \n \n \n \n Salvation through Christ and eternal life is worthless? Got something better in mind?\n\n \n Why couldn't god do it himself Easy? He did everything himself in your bible. He's done nothing since. So Russia, Europe and the US were contacted by God and told to go fight the Nazi's? Just because they're buried under a cross doesn't mean they did it for god. They did it for self preservation. Germany was a Christian nation then, and it is one now. The MILLIONS of people out there during the parades saluting Hitler were the Christian citizens (I strongly doubt the Jewish people were out there).\n \n Yep, your salvation thing is a total fraud as proven by your god not doing anything to help me or the jews/gypsys/gays during the holocaust. And from \"Christians\" like you, all we hear is judgement, nothing else. If your god were true, he would have done something to help me. He did absolutely nothing! Why would I believe in something that is totally incapable of doing anything to help.\n \n Face it, your god has not done one darn thing since the Bible was written. Not one thing! Which means it's all a pack of lies. Telling gay people they can pray their way out of being gay is the biggest and cruelest lie of all. \n \n Funny, when something good happens, it's always god doing it. But when bad things happen and god does nothing, it's has nothing to do with god. Yeah, whatever.",

The fact that there is a penalty for finding it false and a reward for believing it to be true. We all process data differently.

They are sincerely wrong too.\n \n \n Those who don't believe in Jesus are wrong only to you. And since you cannot prove you are right, you have backed yourself up into another corner. \n \n \n \n Mohammed was a butcher who killed Israelites in cold blood. Christ came to save people like Mohammed from their pseudo-religious folly. Israelites did a little killing themselves with God's blessing no less, according to the bible. How do you know this to be true about Mohammed? You claim the Koran is false.\n \n \n \n Wrong. Jesus and his disciples were Jews, and a great many Jews believe in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Messiah. Recommend you don't claim to speak for the entire Jewish race.\n \n \n \n If one believes that Jesus is their Lord and Messiah they are no longer Jews. They are Jews for Jesus, Messianic Jews, etc. They are no longer Jews in the same way that Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme are Jews. I was speaking for true Jews, not Kreploch Kristians. And what is the Jewish race,,,,some kind of Marathon in Miami? Judaism is a belief. Sammy Davis Jr. became a Jew when he married his first wife, who was Jewish. Sammy Davis Jr was black before he became a Jew, and after he converted to Judaism he was still black. His race didn't change, but his Yiddish did improve.\n \n Wrong again. The Word of God says otherwise.\n \n \n \n Of course the suppossed word of God says otherwise, but unfortunately you can't refer to it as the word of god. However you can say it's what you believe to be the word of God. That way you don't speak for others who don't believe the smae way that you do.\n \n \n Get your nose out of the discredited Koran and into the Word of God and maybe you will see the error of your thinking.\n \n \n \n Until you prove Judaism and Islam false, while proving Christianity true, you have nothing but errors in your thinking. You see I do not believe in any of them. But I am aware that other people believe in them with all their heart and soul. That is fine with me. I can accept and appreciate most all beliefs. It's not an issue of one religion being right or wrong. \n \n \n And if the Koran-based 9/11 terrorists think 72 virgins are waiting for them in the afterlife, they're full of folly too. More likely they are in hell to pay for their heinous murders. Cheers...\n \n \n Terrorists are disgusting individuals, agreed.

The warheads MIGHt have carried them at one point, but where totally unsuable for the last 7 or 8 years at least.\n \n So, Faux News, and world nut daily distort the information again.

While no specific biological agents were found there is only one purpose for such trucks. If they were used to aid in disease etc, then they would have been in buildings with clean rooms etc, and would have been available for inspection by the UN. These existed for the sole purpose of evading detection. There is no other reason to have a bio lab in a truck.\n \n EF",

   "The Coming Jewish Temple, etc.\n \n \"In the last days \n the mountain of the LORD's temple will be established \n as chief among the mountains; \n it will be raised above the hills, \n and peoples will stream to it. \n 2 Many nations will come and say, \n \"Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, \n to the house of the God of Jacob.\" - Micah 4:1-2 NIV\n \n \"Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God's temple, proclaiming himself to be God\" (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4).\n \n The Sanhedrin Reestablished\n \n Current Members of the New Jewish Sanhedrin:\n \n The Sanhedrin selected of a group of seven individuals from among themselves to represent the institution in dealings with the public and with Gedolei Yisrael - recognized spiritual leaders of Israel. It was decided to release the names for purposes of transparency as well. It is hoped that the release of the seven names will encourage those who believe that their own rabbis or teachers can contribute to the endeavor, to propose that they also be included in the legislature.\n \n http://www.thesanhedrin.org/en/main/officers.html\n \n Since its launching last October in Tiberias, where it last convened 1,600 years ago, it has met in Jerusalem on a monthly basis. In addition, various committees have met more often to discuss issues such as determining the exact location of the Holy Temple, the establishment of courts of non-Jews who accept the Seven Laws of Noah, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to uproot the Jewish communities of Gaza and northern Samaria, and many more. Article dated September 5, 2005\n \n http://www.israelnn.com/news.php3?id=83438\n \n The Temple Mount Faithful:\n \n (The Temple Mount Faithful are a group of Israelis who have, since their founding, created numerous Temple utensils and furniture - Table of Shewbread, for example - for the express purpose of stocking the anticipated new Jewish Temple once it is rebuilt.)\n \n \"Welcome.... to the home page of the Temple Mount and Land of Israel Faithful Movement. The goal of the Temple Mount Faithful is the building of the Third Temple on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem in our lifetime in accordance with the Word of G-d and all the Hebrew prophets and the liberation of the Temple Mount from Arab (Islamic) occupation so that it may be consecrated to the Name of G-d.\"\n \n http://www.templemountfaithful.org/\n \n Temple Mount Faithful Seek to Lay Temple Cornerstone:\n \n JERUSALEM - In another dramatic and what could be traumatic move, the Temple Mount and Land of Israel Faithful Movement, led by researcher and lecturer, Gershon Salomon, will attempt to move a 4.5 ton cornerstone into place for a planned Third Temple on Monday at 9 a.m. Jerusalem time. It would coincide with the third day of the Feast of Tabernacles in which thousands of Christians are in the city for the Feast. \n (Note: This article was from 1999. The cornerstone was not allowed to be set. The Temple Mount Faithful continue, once a year, to try to lay the cornerstone for the Third Temple.) \n \n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=17202\n \n The group plans to anoint a four-and-a-half ton marble cornerstone, which will be covered with Israeli flags and driven to the Temple Mount on a flatbed truck. Participants will also bring \"reconstructed vessels for the Third Temple, a priest in the original garments, and Levites who will play music,\" recreating historical temple activities. \n \n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=17990\n \n Levis for Temple Services\n \n Recent reports are that many Levis have now been identified and are now in training to perform anticipated Temple practices and services. Besides some who have claimed to have their traditional genealogies, the following DNA analysis also seems to indicate a particular, identifiable blood marker in Levis / Cohens:\n \n The fascinating story of how DNA studies confirm an ancient biblical tradition\n \n Solidifying their hypothesis of the Cohens' common ancestor, they found that a particular array of six chromosomal markers was found in 97 of the 106 Cohens tested. This collection of markers has come to be known as the Cohen Modal Hapoltype (CMH) -- the standard genetic signature of the Jewish priestly family. The chances of these findings happening at random is greater than one in 10,000.\n \n The finding of a common set of genetic markers in both Ashkenazi and Sephardi Cohanim worldwide clearly indicates an origin pre-dating the separate development of the two communities around 1000 CE. Date calculation based on the variation of the mutations among Cohanim today yields a time frame of 106 generations from the ancestral founder of the line, some 3,300 years -- the approximate time of the Exodus from Egypt, the lifetime of Aaron HaCohen.\n \n http://www.aish.com/societywork/sciencenature/the_cohanim_-_dna_connection.asp\n \n Along with all this, other reports I've seen in the news or on TV indicate that the Jews now have the special \"blue dye\" (made from a particular sea shell / animal previously thought to be extinct).
