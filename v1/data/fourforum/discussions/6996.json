   "The interpretation of the eye of a needle passage as other than the literal does seem like those who are wealthy trying to evade a difficult teaching. This seems corroborated by Luke 6:20-26:\nIn addition, we can't ignore what Jesus said to the rich man before he said \"it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\" Jesus told the rich man to sell all his earthly possessions, and give the money to the poor -- can't get much clearer than that. In fact, because of Jesus' teachings on money and possession, Monsignor John P. Meier of Catholic University said, \"...you find out that Jesus actually was a radical egalitarian feminist socialist with a social agenda\".\nOn the contrary, it seems more likely that Jesus was engaging his penchant for the ridiculous, as with his statment about removing the log from your own eye before removing the mote from you brother's.\nYou're right. At times Jesus used hyperbole to get his point across. You have noted two such times. In the \"eye of a needle\" metaphor Jesus was conveying how near to impossible it was for a rich man to enter the kingdom. He goes even further in one of his parables in Luke:\n \n And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me... (Lk:16:22)\n \n This time he just says the rich guy ends up in hell. He reiterates his theme of the conflict between the acquiring riches on earth and getting into heaven.\n \n Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. (Mt:19:23)\n \n That is why Monsignor Meier and many other Christian theologians have concluded that Jesus was more a socialist than a capitalist. It is also the basis for the Catholic clerics' vow of poverty.",
