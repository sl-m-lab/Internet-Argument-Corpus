   "Here's another example of public schools silencing homosexuality. I hope they do get sued and are forced to allow this access. Young gays and lesbians need as many outlets of support as possible. \n \n \n \n HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL CALLS FOR LGBT WEB SITE ACCESS FOR STUDENTS\n OIA Newsdesk\n \n \n \n \n WEST PALM BEACH - The Palm Beach County Human Rights Council called on the ACLU and Lambda Legal to force the Palm Beach County School District to stop blocking students' access to LGBT web sites.\n \n The school district has declared millions of web sites as unappropriate because they promote violence, racism and pornography.\n \n In doing so, the district has blocked access to gay and lesbian advocacy web sites, including pbchrc.org, the one belonging to the Palm Beach County Human Rights Council, a local GLBT advocacy group.\n \n \"It is unfair that our site is being censored, while students have access to anti-gay sites,\" said Rand Hoch, founder of the Palm Beach County Human Rights Council. \"The district is also blocking both the Compass and the P-Flag web sites.\"Compass is the local LGBT community center which runs numerous programs for LGBT youth in Palm Beach County.\n \n Students are granted access to many sites opposing gay rights such as the American Family Association, Focus on the Family and the Traditional Values Coalition.\n \n \"The Council has asked both the ACLU and Lambda Legal to consider challenging the school board's policy,\" Hoch said. \"Both organizations have experience in combating similar censorship elsewhere in America.\"\n \n High school teacher Michael Woods, who served as the sponsor for Boynton Beach High's Gay-Straight Alliance last year, said blocking gay advocacy web sites sends a negative message to students.\n \n \"One of the things we tell kids is that when you hit the firewall, it's a bad thing,\" Woods said. \"I agree with filtering, but now they are going to see gay/lesbian and associate that with something that is bad.\"\n \n Advocates also say the sites provide information and resources for students, who may be uncomfortable soliciting it from adults.\n \n \"We need to recognize the computer has become a community tool for students to reach out,\" said Tony Plakas, president of the West Palm Beach-based Compass, a gay and lesbian center.\n \n James Green, an ACLU lawyer, plans to review the case this week. The ACLU has sued in the past over censorship on the Web. In 2002, the Georgia ACLU filed a free-speech lawsuit on behalf of the Gay Guardian newspaper, claiming that a public library barred the newspaper from the library's free literature area. \n \n \"If their blocking software prevents kids, particularly middle and high school kids, from having access to information about gay rights and public health issues, but on the other hand allow access to religious group Web sites that are hostile to gay and lesbian legal rights and public health, that constitutes censorship,\" Green said. \n \n \"That's a lot of power, to decide what information is given,\" said Rand Hoch, founder of the Palm Beach County Human Rights Council. \"There has to be a better way the school district can strike a balance than blocking all access to all students.\"\n \n School board member Paulette Burdick agrees. \n \n \"Perhaps the only good source of information in regard to this sensitive issue is the Internet,\" Burdick said. \"We need to figure out a way to address this.\" [5/9/06]",

   "Well, if you're looking to end discrimination against SOME websites, but not all of them, they you're still wanting some gay sites to be discriminated against. Which is it going to be? And how are you going to decide which ones??\n\n \n I am fine with SOME gay and lesbian websites being \"discriminated\" against if there is objectionable/sexual material on them. I don't think I ever said that every gay & lesbian website should be unblocked. \n \n \n \n \nI understand what you're saying, but it's your opinion about these sites that not everyone shares. If you can prove that reading FoF leads to violence against gays, then by all means do so. Meanwhile, parents are still going to want their kids protected from porn, and schools just aren't going to want to go through and separate the gay porn sites from the non-porn gay sites.\n\n \n Many people feel that the american family website and those similar are obscene and promotes intolerance. They portray gays and lesbians as unnatural and deviants. I bet many who read this thread think they are obscene like I do. I'm sure gay parents do as well. I have mentioned before that they promote \"reparative therapy\" and gave a list of all the organizations against this because it is harmful and pointed out that the students would have no where else to turn on the internet. \n \n Here is an excerpt from the APA website. You find them credible don't you? \n \n Gay, lesbian, and bisexual adolescents follow a develop-mental path that is both similar to and quite different from that followed by heterosexual adolescents. All teenagers face certain developmental challenges, such as developing social skills, thinking about career choices, and fitting into a peer group. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth must also cope with prejudiced, discriminatory, and violent behavior and messages in their families, schools, and communities. Such behavior and messages negatively affect the health, mental health and education of lesbian, gay, and bisexual young people. These students are more likely than heterosexual students to report missing school due to fear, being threatened by other students, and having their property damaged at school.1 The promotion of \"reparative therapy\" and \"transformational ministry\" is likely to exacerbate the risk of harassment, harm, and fear.For these reasons, the experience of gay, lesbian, and bisexual teenagers is often one of isolation, fear of stigmatization, and lack of peer or familial support. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth have few opportunities for observing positive modeling by adults due to the general cultural bias that makes gay, lesbian, and bisexual people largely invisible. It is this isolation and lack of support that accounts in part for the higher rates of emotional distress,2 suicide attempts,3 and risky sexual behavior and substance use 4 that gay, lesbian,and bisexual students report compared to heterosexual students. Because of their legitimate fear of being harassed or hurt, gay, lesbian, or bisexual youth are less likely to ask for help. Thus, it is important that their environments be as open and accepting as possible, so these young people will feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and concerns. To be able to provide an accepting environment, school personnel need to understand the nature of sexual orientation development and be supportive of healthy development for all youth.\n \n \nThink about it. You take away a large chunk of a school's budget (for one year or multiple years) in a lawsuit, and kids are effected in numerous ways in terms of the educational opportunities that school can provide. Did you think schools just have a lot of money laying around? Take teacher salaries for instance; what do you think is going to happen with an already-strapped teacher salary budget in public schools if you start eating up their budgets in lawsuits? It's not like they have a bunch of cash laying around. And even if they have litigation insurance, they could lose it, or or the rates could skyrocket on them still impacting their educational budgets. Yes, it does effect the kids in various ways. Lawsuits often seem like an easy way to get revenge on institutions for those who don't think through the real-world effects and people effected by them.\n\n \n Any blame for taking away money from the students lies on the school. If they are purposely or made aware of something unjust, then do nothing about it and get sued, the school district is the one to blame. No one else. \n \n \n \nHow do you even know they block ALL gay websites? They only mention a very few in the article!\n\n \n The article which thelmoose presented shows that the school blocks by the keywords \"gay/lesbian\". Seems the school district is saying that anything and everything gay & lesbian is inapproriate. What a message to send to the students! Especially the gay and lesbian ones. \n \n Those people that claim to have the moral high ground always amaze me. How can contributing to the ridicule and emotional devestation of young gay and lesbians be moral?",

I also showed that the APA considers reparative therapy, which this site promotes, is harmful to gays and helps create a hostile atmospere for gays.

It's obvious by LOOKING at the examples there is NO PORN CONTENT on them, but they were blocked anyways.\n \n And the truly stupid part of this is that the majority of your arguments have RESTED SOLELY on the \"gay\" aspect as having a correlation to porn or soft porn. THAT'S IT! You have even given the \"rule\" yourself, but you don't want to admit it!\n \n \n \nWell that's your opinion. It's certainly a stretch to say they are calling for harassment of gay people. Porn, on the other hand, has a lot MORE public opposition when it comes to children viewing it.\n\n You think it's a \"stretch\" regarding harassment...\n But when it comes to blocking gay web-sites which HAVE NO PORN, you think that's just acceptable.",

Period.\n Despite how much you've tried to pretend it's \"okay\" for them to do so, you're running on hot air without ANY knowledge of how these things work.\n If the school won't fix what is obviously wrong, then they should get sued.
