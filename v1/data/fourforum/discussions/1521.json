   "ELLEN G. WHITE is one of the founders of the 7th Day Adventists; a group that claims to rest its authority on the Bible.\n \n Ellen wheeled out a number of prophetic statements concerning Scriptures.\n \n \n ELLEN G. WHITE?S ADDITIONS TO THE HOLY BIBLE\n \n 1. ADAM WAS MORE THAN TWICE AS TALL AS MEN TODAY.\n EGW ? YES: \"As Adam came forth from the hand of his Creator?He was more\n than twice as tall as men now living upon the earth?Eve was not quite as\n tall as Adam. Her head reached a little above his shoulders.\" (Spiritual\n Gifts, Vol. 3 p.34).\n \"Adam?s height was much greater than that of men who now inhabit the\n earth. Eve was somewhat less in stature;\" (Patriarchs and Prophets, p.45).\n Note: Not Biblical. The Bible does not tell us the height of Adam and Eve,\n but Ellen does not leave us in doubt as to their height.\n \n 2. IN THE FIRES OF HELL, DO THE WICKED FEEL PAIN AS LONG AS THERE IS ONE\n PIECE OF FLESH LEFT?\n EGW ? YES: \"I saw that some were quickly destroyed, while others suffered\n longer. Some were many days consuming, and just as long as there was a\n portion of them unconsumed, all the sense of suffering was there.\"\n (Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 1, p.217).\n NOTE: Not Biblical. What if their brain is consumed first, will they still\n feel pain? Can a finger feel pain after the rest of the body is destroyed?\n Where is a Bible text to support this error? The teaching of annihilation\n is not Biblical. (Please see Chapter 22 that deals with this subject.)\n \n 3. DID JUDAS HAVE A CONVICTION TO CONFESS HIS SIN?\n EGW ? (1898) YES: \"When the Saviour?s hands were bathing those soiled\n feet, and wiping them with the towel, the heart of Judas thrilled through\n and through with the impulse then and there to confess his sin.\" (Desire\n of Ages p.645).\n EGW ? (1902) NO: \"As Christ celebrated this ordinance with His disciples,\n conviction came to the hearts of all save Judas.\" (Evangelism p.275).\n Note: Mrs. White said yes in 898 and God and Ellen changed their minds in\n 1902 and said no. This kind of inspiration is very hard to keep up with. I\n am thankful that the prophets of the Bible did not have this problem.\n \n 4. THE HEROD MISTAKE AND COVER-UP\n EGW was under the impression that the Herod that took part in Jesus? trial\n was the same Herod that took the life of James. She did not realize that\n it was Herod Antipas, who took part in Jesus? trial and Herod Agrippa I,\n who put James to death. This mistake was due to her ignorance of the Bible\n and Bible history. Writing under inspiration; EGW wrote in 1858 that,\n \"Herod?s heart grew still harder, and when he heard that JESUS had arisen,\n he was not much troubled. He took the life of James; and when he saw that\n this pleased the Jews, he took Peter also, intending to put him to death.\"\n (Spiritual Gifts, Vol 1, p.71).\n Note the COVER-UP: This error was never corrected in the revisions of\n Early Writings. But when the error was discovered the authors tried to fix\n it by a footnote on page 185 of Early writings saying it was, \"the same\n Herodian spirit only in another personality.\" Notice Ellen was talking\n under inspiration about an individual, Herod, not the spirit of an\n individual or their attributes. Jesus certainly knew the difference between\n the Herods and the reason Ellen did not, was that she was not inspired and\n did not have the gift of prophecy.\n \n 5. JESUS? BROTHERS WERE OLDER THAN HE AND THEY WERE THE SONS OF JOSEPH AND\n SIDED WITH THE RABBIS.\n EGW ? YES: \"All this displeased His brothers. Being older than Jesus, they\n felt that He should be under their dictation. His brothers, as the sons of\n Joseph were called, sided with the rabbis. They insisted that the\n traditions must be heeded, as if they were the requirements of God.\"\n (Desire of Ages, p.86,87).\n Note: Not Biblical. EGW adds to the Bible the same way that Joseph Smith\n does in the Book of Mormon. How can Adventists claim that the Bible is the\n source of their faith and accept this as the truth, and do it with a\n straight face? The Bible clearly states that Jesus was the firstborn of\n Mary. (And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and\n he called his name JESUS.) How can the firstborn have older brothers?\n (Matthew 1:25; Luke 2:7).\n \n 6. ANGELS NEED A GOLD CARD TO GET INTO AND OUT OF HEAVEN.\n EGW ? YES: \"All angels that are commissioned to visit earth hold a golden\n card, which they present to the angels at the gates of the city.\" (Early\n Writings p.39).\n Note: Not Biblical. If this statement came from Joseph Smith would you\n accept it? No, because it is not found in the Bible. Then using the same\n principle for defining your faith how can you believe EGW's nonsense as\n truth? Does God who can number the hairs on our head, need a gold card to\n identify the angels? Why have angels at the gate when an ATM machine would\n work just as well?\n \n 7. ELLEN G. WHITE THE ONLY PROPHET GIVEN WINGS WHILE IN VISION.\n EGW ? YES: \"The Lord has given me a view of other worlds. Wings were given\n me, and an angel attended me from the city to a place that was bright and\n glorious.\" (Early Writings p.39).\n Note: Not Biblical. No Bible prophet was ever given wings at any time. Why\n were wings given to Ellen White in her vision? In vision they would not be\n necessary for travel. She certainly had a vivid imagination.\n \n SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST?S CLAIM\n Seventh-day Adventists claim to be people of the Bible and that their\n beliefs are supported by Scripture. They reject the Roman Catholic Church\n beliefs such as, praying to Mary and the saints, the confessional, rosary,\n holy water, the Pope as head of the church, etc. They reject Joseph Smith\n and his book of Mormon, they reject Mary Baker Eddy and her book Science\n and Health with Keys to Scripture. They reject the Jehovah?s Witnesses,\n which have the Watchtower to guide them. SDA?s reject all beliefs that\n cannot be supported by the Bible. The paradox is, that the church accepts\n Ellen White's additions to the Bible and her contradictions without\n question. And then, like any other cult, expects members to do likewise.\n The SDA church insists all these additions and contradictions came\n straight from God, thus making God a part of their deception.\n \n HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?\n The Seventh-day Adventist Church tell us: \"The writings of Mrs. White were\n never designed to be an addition to the canon of Scripture. They are,\n nevertheless, the messages of God to the remnant church and should be\n received as such as were the messages of the prophets of old. As Samuel\n was a prophet to Israel in his day, as Jeremiah was a prophet to Israel in\n the days of the captivity, as John the Baptist came as a special messenger\n of the Lord to prepare the way for Christ?s appearing, so we believe that\n Mrs. White was a prophet to the Church of Christ today. And the same as\n the messages of the prophets were received in olden times, so her messages\n should be received at the present time.\" (Review and Herald, October 4,\n 1928).\n Note: Christians accept the writing of the prophets, Samuel, Jeremiah, as\n inspired by God and their writings as Holy Scripture. To follow what the\n SDA Church tells its members, then those who believe that Ellen White is\n inspired would have to regard her writings as Scripture, the same way, as\n they do the Bible prophets. But the church tells them her writings are not\n \"an addition to the canon of Scripture!\" Does this confuse you? If you\n understand how it is possible, please explain it to me!\n \n Did Ellen White claim infallibility for the Testimonies?\n Yes\n \"Yet, now when I send you a testimony of warning and reproof, many of you\n declare it to be merely the opinion of Sister White. You thereby insulted\n the Spirit of God.\" (Testimonies, Vol. 5, p.64).\n \"In these letters which I write, in the testimonies I bear, I am\n presenting to you that which the Lord has presented to me. I do not write\n one article in the paper expressing merely my own ideas. They are what God\n has opened before me in vision, the precious rays of light shining from\n the throne.\" (Testimonies, Vol. 5, p.67).\n \"If you lessen the confidence of God?s people in the testimonies He has\n sent them, you are rebelling against God as were Korah, Dathan, and\n Abiram.\" (Testimonies , Vol.5, p.66).\n \"The Testimonies are of the Spirit of God, or of the devil. In arraying\n yourself against the servants of God you are doing a work either for God\n or for the devil.\" (Testimonies, Vol. 4, p.230).\n \n 1. WAS THE PLAN OF SALVATION MADE AFTER THE FALL?\n EGW ?YES: \"The kingdom of grace was instituted immediately after the fall\n of man, when a plan was devised for the redemption of the guilty race.\"\n (Great Controversy, p.347).\n BIBLE ? NO: \"Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with\n corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation\n received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of\n Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: Who verily was\n foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these\n last times for you.\" (1 Pet 1:18-20).\n BIBLE ? NO: \"According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation\n of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in\n love.\" (Eph 1:4).\n NOTE: The Gospel of salvation through grace by faith in Jesus Christ was\n already in existence before the creation of this world. EGW contradicts\n the Bible by claiming the plan of salvation was devised after the fall of\n Adam and Eve.\n \n 2. WAS ADAM WITH EVE WHEN SHE WAS TEMPTED IN THE GARDEN?\n EGW ? NO: \"The angels had cautioned Eve to beware of separating herself\n from her husband while occupied in their daily labor in the garden; with\n him she would be in less temptation than if she were alone. But absorbed\n in her pleasing task, she unconsciously wandered from his side. On\n perceiving that she was alone, she felt an apprehension of danger. She\n soon found herself gazing with mingled curiosity and admiration upon the\n forbidden tree.\" (Patriarchs and Prophets, pp.53,54).\n BIBLE ? YES: \"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and\n that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one\n wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her\n husband with her; and he did eat.\" (Genesis 3:6).\n NOTE: There is no record in the Bible of angels warning Even of being\n separate from her husband.\n \n 3. WAS ADAM DECEIVED BY SATAN?\n EGW ? YES: \"Satan, who is the father of lies, deceived Adam in a similar\n way, telling him that he need not obey God, that he would not die if he\n transgressed the law.\" (Evangelism, p.598).\n BIBLE ?NO: \"And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in\n the transgression.\" (1 Timothy 2:14).\n Note: Who showed EGW that Satan deceived Adam, when the Bible says Adam\n was not deceived?\n \n 4. DID PRE-FLOOD HUMANS MATE WITH ANIMALS AND GIVE BIRTH TO NEW SUB-HUMAN\n SPECIES AND RACES?\n EGW ? YES: \"But if there was one sin above another which called for the\n destruction of the race by the flood, it was the base crime of\n amalgamation of man and beast which defaced the image of God, and caused\n confusion everywhere.\" (Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 3, p.64).\n EGW ? YES: \"Every species of animal which God had created were preserved\n in the ark. The confused species which God did not create, which were the\n result of amalgamation, were destroyed by the flood. Since the flood there\n has been amalgamation of man and beast, as may be seen in the almost\n endless varieties of species of animals, and in certain races of men.\"\n (Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 3, p.75).\n BIBLE ? NO: \"And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature\n after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after\n his kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his\n kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the\n earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\" (Genesis 1:24,25).\n NOTE: Five times in these two verses God states that animals can only\n reproduce according \"to their own kinds.\" Horses cannot mate with birds\n and produce offspring. Neither can humans mate with monkeys and produce\n offspring. Even SDA scientists and the Ellen White Estate admits EGW was\n simply wrong.\n \n 5. DID GOD OR AN ANGEL SHUT THE DOOR OF NOAH'S ARK?\n EGW ? ANGEL: \"An angel is seen by the scoffing multitude descending from\n heaven clothed with brightness like the lightning. He closes that massive\n outer door, and takes his course upward to heaven again.\" (Spiritual\n Gifts, Vol. 3, p.68, written in 1864).\n EGW ? GOD: \"?God had shut it, and God alone could open it.\" (Patriarchs\n and Prophets, p.98, written in 1890).\n BIBLE ? GOD: \"In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and\n Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his\n sons with them, into the ark; And they that went in, went in male and\n female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.\n (Genesis 7:13,16).\n NOTE: The Bible says the Lord shut Noah in, EGW disagreed in 1864 saying\n it was an angel who shut the door. Then twenty-six years later in 1890,\n she changed her mind and wrote that it really was God who shut the door.\n First she contradicted the Bible and then she contradicted herself. SDA?s\n try to reconcile EGW with the Bible by saying, \"Oh, God used an angel to\n shut the door.\" If so, then why doesn't the Bible tell us that? Why is it\n that none of the Bible prophets knew God \"used an angel?\" Why was this\n information only available to Christians through EGW? And why does her\n information contradict every one of the Bible writers? If the OT Bible\n record was wrong, then why did Jesus say the Bible is \"truth.\" (John\n 17:17) For EGW to be right; the Bible, Moses, Jesus and Ellen White\n herself have to be wrong!\n \n 6. WAS THE TOWER OF BABEL BUILT BEFORE THE FLOOD?\n EGW ? YES: \"This system was corrupted before the flood by those who\n separated themselves from the faithful followers of God, and engaged in\n the building of the tower of Babel.\" (Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 3, p.301).\n BIBLE ? NO: \"These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their\n generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in\n the earth after the flood. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city\n and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name,\n lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.\" (Gen\n 10:32;11:4).\n NOTE: This was one of the first EGW contradictions that SDA?s found and\n corrected. They claimed it was just a typographical error, forgetting that\n EGW claimed every word she wrote came from God! (Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 2,\n p.293).\n \n 7. DID GOD SEND RAVENS TO FEED ELIJAH?\n EGW ? NO: \"There He honored Elijah by sending food to him morning and\n evening by an angel of heaven.\" (Testimonies, Vol. 3, p.288, written in\n 1873).\n EGW ? YES: \"He who fed Elijah by the brook, making a raven His messenger.\"\n (Testimonies, Vol. 4, p.253, written in 1876).\n BIBLE ? YES: \"And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I\n have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. So he went and did according\n unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith,\n that is before Jordan. And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the\n morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.\" (1\n Kings 17:4-6).\n NOTE: In 1873 EGW contradicted the Bible when she said Elijah was fed by\n an angel. Then three years later in 1876 she changed her mind and agreed\n with the Bible that it really was a raven. Then, a year after her death,\n her editors tried to smooth things over by omitting any reference to either\n an angel or a raven. They changed EGW's words to say Elijah was just\n \"miraculously provided with food.\" (Prophets and Kings, p.129, written in\n 1916).\n \n 8. WAS THE MAN JESUS CHRIST ALSO TRULY GOD?\n EGW ? NO: \"The man Christ Jesus was not the Lord God Almighty.\" (Letter\n 32, 1999, quoted in the Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Vol. 5,\n p.1129).\n BIBLE ? YES: \"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the\n government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called\n Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince\n of Peace.\" (Isa 9:6).\n BIBLE ? YES: \"Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,\n and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail\n because of him. Even so, Amen. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the\n ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the\n Almighty.\" (Rev 1:7-8).\n BIBLE ? YES: \"Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a\n name which is above every name:\" (Phil 2:9).\n NOTE: The deity of Christ is a fundamental doctrine. Any other belief is\n HERESY.\n \n 9. WHO CHOSE JUDAS TO BE ONE OF JESUS' TWELVE DISCIPLES?\n EGW - CHRIST CHOSE JUDAS: \"When Judas was chosen by our Lord, his case was\n not hopeless.\" (Testimonies, Vol. 4, p.41).\n EGW - DISCIPLES CHOSE JUDAS: \"The disciples were anxious that Judas should\n become one of their number. They commended him to Jesus.\" (Desire of Ages,\n p.294).\n EGW - JUDAS CHOSE HIMSELF: \"While Jesus was preparing the disciples for\n their ordination, one who had not been summoned urged his presence among\n them. It was Judas Iscariot, a man who professed to be a follower of\n Christ. He now came forward soliciting a place in this inner circle of\n disciples. He hoped to experience this through connecting himself with\n Jesus.\" (Desire of Ages, pp.293, 717).\n BIBLE - JESUS CHOSE JUDAS: \"And when it was day, he called unto him his\n disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;\n Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John,\n Philip and Bartholomew, Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and\n Simon called Zelotes, And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot,\n which also was the traitor. Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you\n twelve, and one of you is a devil? He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of\n Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve. Ye\n have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye\n should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that\n whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.\"\n (Luke 6:13-16; John 6:70-71; John 15:16).\n \n 10. WAS THE ATONEMENT FOR SIN COMPLETED AT THE CROSS?\n EGW ? NO: \"Instead of?Daniel 8:14 referring to the purifying of the earth,\n it was now plain that it pointed to the closing work of our High Priest in\n heaven, the finishing of the atonement, and the preparing of the people to\n abide the day of His coming.\" (Testimonies, Vol. 1, p.58).\n EGW ? NO: \"Jesus entered the most holy of the heavenly sanctuary, at the\n end of the 2300 days of Daniel 8, in 1844, to make a final atonement for\n all who could be benefited by His mediation.\" (Early Writings, p.253).\n BIBLE ? YES: \"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It\n is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.\" (John 19:30).\n BIBLE ? YES: \"But now the righteousness of God without the law is\n manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; Even the\n righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon\n all them that believe: for there is no difference: For all have sinned,\n and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace\n through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to\n be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness\n for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;\"\n (Rom 3:21-25).\n BIBLE ? YES: \"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall\n be saved from wrath through him. For if, when we were enemies, we were\n reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we\n shall be saved by his life. And not only so, but we also joy in God\n through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the\n atonement.\" (Rom 5:9-11).\n NOTE: The Bible totally rejects EGW's idea of the 2300 days and an\n investigative judgment in the heavenly sanctuary beginning in 1844. Notice\n how the Bible texts quoted above were all written less than thirty years\n after Jesus' resurrection, and all clearly state that Christians living\n then were already fully justified, redeemed, sanctified and reconciled to\n God through Christ's death on the cross. There is not a verse in the Bible\n to support the SDA sanctuary doctrine.\n \n 11. DOES THE BLOOD OF CHRIST CANCEL SIN?\n EGW ? NO: \"The blood of Christ, while it was to release the repentant\n sinner from the condemnation of the law, was not to cancel sin?it will\n stand in the sanctuary until the final atonement.\" (Patriarchs and\n Prophets, p.357).\n BIBLE ? YES: \"In whom we have redemption through his blood, the\n forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;\" (Eph. 1:7).\n BIBLE ? YES: \"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have\n fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son\n cleanseth us from all sin.\" (1 John 1:7).\n BIBLE ? YES: \"Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and\n whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not\n impute sin.\" (Rom 4:7-8).\n NOTE: To forgive means to pardon, give up all rights to punish, to forever\n cancel a debt. Jesus did all that for us when He shed His blood for us.\n The Bible says that forgiven sins are never counted against an individual.\n However Ellen White contradicts the Bible by claiming God stores up our\n sins and later punishes us for them if we do not measure up to His\n standard before the final atonement. This idea causes millions of SDA?s\n agony as they question whether or not they will be saved.\n \n 12. WHO BEARS OUR SINS?\n EGW ? SATAN: \"It was seen, also, that while the sin offering pointed to\n Christ as a sacrifice, and the high priest represented Christ as a\n mediator, the scapegoat typified Satan, the author of sin, upon whom the\n sins of the truly penitent will finally be placed. Christ will place all\n these sins upon Satan, ? so Satan, ?will at last suffer the full penalty of\n sin.\" (Great Controversy, p.422,485,486).\n BIBLE ? JESUS: \"Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the\n tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by\n whose stripes ye were healed.\" (1 Pet 2:24).\n \n 13. CAN WE SAY WE ARE SAVED RIGHT NOW BY CHRIST'S GRACE?\n EGW ? NO: \"Those who accept the Saviour, however sincere their conversion,\n should never be taught to say or feel that they are saved. Those who\n accept Christ, and in their first confidence say, I am saved, are in\n danger of trusting to themselves.\" (Christ's Object Lessons, p. 155).\n BIBLE ? YES: \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and\n believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come\n into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.\" (John 5:24).\n \"These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son\n of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may\n believe on the name of the Son of God.\" (1 John 5:13).\n NOTE: The reason the apostle John wrote his letter was to assure the\n believers that they had eternal life.\n 14. CAN IGNORANT SLAVES BE SAVED?\n EGW ? NO: \"God cannot take to heaven the slave who has been kept in\n ignorance and degradation, knowing nothing of God or the Bible, fearing\n nothing but his master's lash, and holding a lower position than the\n brutes.\" (Early Writings, p.276).\n BIBLE ? YES: \"That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that\n cometh into the world.\" (John 1:9).\n \n 15. CAN WE LEGITIMATELY SAY \"I HAVE CEASED TO SIN?\"\n EGW ? YES: \"Christ died to make it possible for you to cease to sin, and\n sin is the transgression of the law.\" (Review and Herald, Vol. 71, No. 35,\n p.1, August 28, 1894).\n EGW ? YES: \"To be redeemed means to cease from sin.\" (Review and Herald,\n Vol. 77, No. 39, p.1, September 25, 1900).\n EGW ? YES: \"Those only who through faith in Christ obey all of God's\n commandments will reach the condition of sinlessness in which Adam lived\n before his transgression. They testify to their love of Christ by obeying\n all his precepts.\" (Manuscript 122, 1901, quoted in the Seventh-day\n Adventist Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p.1118).\n EGW ? YES: \"To every one who surrenders fully to God is given the\n privilege of living without sin, in obedience to the law of heaven. God\n requires of us perfect obedience. We are to purify ourselves, even as he\n is pure. By keeping his commandments, we are to reveal our love for the\n Supreme Ruler of the universe.\" (Review and Herald, September 27, 1906,\n p.8).\n BIBLE ? NO: \"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have\n fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son\n cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive\n ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is\n faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all\n unrighteousness.\" (1 John 1:7-9).\n BIBLE ? NO: \"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of\n yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should\n boast.\" (Eph 2:8-9).\n \n 16. WILL OBEYING THE COMMANDMENTS EARN ME GOD'S FAVOR?\n EGW ? YES: \"To obey the commandments of God is the only way to obtain\n (earn) His favor.\" (Testimonies, Vol. 4, p.28).\n BIBLE ? NO: \"But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our\n righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our\n iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.\" (Isa 64:6).\n BIBLE ? NO: \"But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God,\n it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.\" (Gal 3:11).\n \n 17. DOES OUR OBEDIENCE AND FAITH RECONCILE US TO GOD?\n EGW ? YES: \"Man, who has defaced the image of God in his soul by a corrupt\n life, cannot, by mere human effort, effect a radical change in himself. He\n must accept the provisions of the gospel; he must be reconciled to God\n through obedience to his law and faith in Jesus Christ.\" (Testimonies,\n Vol. 4, p.294).\n BIBLE ? NO: \"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of\n yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should\n boast.\" (Eph 2:8-9).\n BIBLE ? NO: \"And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your\n mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled In the body of his flesh\n through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in\n his sight:\" (Col 1:21-22).\n \n 18. DID JESUS ENTER THE MOST HOLY PLACE OF THE HEAVENLY TEMPLE BEFORE\n OCTOBER 22, 1844?\n EGW ? NO: \"I was shown that?the door was opened in the most holy place in\n the heavenly sanctuary, where the ark is, in which are contained the ten\n commandments. This door was not opened until the mediation of Jesus was\n finished in the holy place of the sanctuary in 1844. Then Jesus rose up\n and shut the door of the holy place, and opened the door into the most\n holy, and passed within the second veil, where he now stands by the ark.\"\n (Early Writings, p.42).\n BIBLE ? YES: \"Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own\n blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal\n redemption for us.\" (Hebrews 9:12 written in 60 AD).\n NOTE: This Bible text was written in 60 AD, and it states that Jesus was\n already ministering in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary at\n least 1,824 years before 1844. Ellen White's 1844 scenario simply\n contradicts the clearest Scriptures!\n \n 19. DID PAUL LEARN THE GOSPEL FROM MEN IN THE CHURCH?\n EGW ? YES: \"Paul must receive instruction in the Christian faith and move\n accordingly. Christ sends him to His very disciples whom he had been so\n bitterly persecuting, to learn of them. Now Paul was in a condition to\n learn of those whom God had ordained to teach the truth. Christ directs\n Paul to His chosen servants, thus placing him in connection with His\n church. The very men whom Paul was purposing to destroy were to be his\n instructors in the very religion that he had despised and persecuted.\"\n (Testimonies, Vol. 3, p.430).\n BIBLE ? NO: \"But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was\n preached of me is not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither\n was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. To reveal his Son\n in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred\n not with flesh and blood: Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which\n were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto\n Damascus. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and\n abode with him fifteen days. But other of the apostles saw I none, save\n James the Lord's brother. Now the things which I write unto you, behold,\n before God, I lie not.\" (Gal. 1:11-12, 16-20).\n \n 20. WHAT IS \"THE SEAL OF GOD\"?\n EGW ? SABBATH: \"The enemies of God's law, from the ministers down to the\n least among them, have a new conception of truth and duty. Too late they\n see that the Sabbath of the fourth commandment is the seal of the living\n God.\" (Great Controversy, p.640).\n BIBLE - HOLY SPIRIT: \"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the\n word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye\n believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,\" (Eph 1:13).\n BIBLE - HOLY SPIRIT: \"And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye\n are sealed unto the day of redemption.\" (Eph 4:30).\n NOTE: This is a crucial contradiction. The Bible is certain that God's\n seal is the Holy Spirit. But EGW denies this Bible truth, claiming that the\n seventh-day Sabbath is God's seal. Thus Sabbath-keeping is promoted as the\n great determiner of who is lost and who is saved. In this, EGW proclaims\n that it is the Sabbath which saves, rather than Jesus Christ who saves!\n This is heresy, claiming salvation by works. EGW makes the Sabbath the\n greatest commandment of all.\n \n 21. WILL WE KNOW THE EXACT DAY AND HOUR OF CHRIST'S COMING?\n EGW ? YES: \"As God has shown me in holy vision?we heard the voice of God\n like many waters, which gave us the day and hour of Jesus' coming.\" (Early\n Writings, pp.15,34,285).\n BIBLE ? NO: \"Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour\n wherein the Son of man cometh.\" (Mat 25:13).\n BIBLE ? NO: \"But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the\n angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.\" (Mark\n 13:32).\n \n 22. WILL THE SAVED HAVE WINGS IN THE RESURRECTION?\n EGW ? YES: \"We gathered about Jesus, and just as He closed the gates of\n the city, the curse was pronounced upon the wicked. The gates were shut.\n Then the saints used their wings and mounted to the top of the wall of the\n city.\" (Early Writings, p.53).\n \n BIBLE ? NO: \"Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like\n unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to\n subdue all things unto himself.\" (Phil 3:21).\n NOTE: The Bible says the resurrected saints will have a body like Christ's\n resurrected body. Nowhere in scripture is there even a hint that Jesus had\n wings.\n \n SUMMARY\n Ellen White once stated: \"The Bible must be your counselor. Study it and\n the testimonies God has given; for they never contradict His Word.\"\n (Selected Messages, Vol. 3, p.32).\n From the evidence you have seen, do you think Ellen White's writings\n (testimonies) \"never contradict\" God's Word? Isn't it clear that even by\n denying that she contradicts the Bible, she is simply proving that she\n cannot be trusted?",

   "5. JESUS? BROTHERS WERE OLDER THAN HE AND THEY WERE THE SONS OF JOSEPH AND\n SIDED WITH THE RABBIS.\n EGW ? YES: \"All this displeased His brothers. Being older than Jesus, they\n felt that He should be under their dictation. His brothers, as the sons of\n Joseph were called, sided with the rabbis. They insisted that the\n traditions must be heeded, as if they were the requirements of God.\"\n (Desire of Ages, p.86,87).\n Note: Not Biblical. EGW adds to the Bible the same way that Joseph Smith\n does in the Book of Mormon. How can Adventists claim that the Bible is the\n source of their faith and accept this as the truth, and do it with a\n straight face? The Bible clearly states that Jesus was the firstborn of\n Mary. (And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and\n he called his name JESUS.) How can the firstborn have older brothers?\n (Matthew 1:25; Luke 2:7).\n\n \n If you actually read Matthew 1:25 and Luke 2:7 they very clearly say \"her firstborn.\" Joseph could have had sons by a previous wife.",
