This rarely if ever happens. However, as Blackstone says, if after applying the plain meaning we discover the \"words happen to be still dubious,\" then and only then do we look outside the plain meaning for interpretive guidance. \n \n The language itself is not dubious or ambiguous: \"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.\" It is nothing more than a preamble stating a universally held belief that standing armies, in times of peace, are dangerous to liberty (hence the use of the term \"free state\").\n \n But if there is any concern about the goal behind the militia clause, then we need only take Blackstone's advice and look at the words of the founders regarding this subject. Here are a few examples:\n \n \"It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government, that a well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen.\" John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)\n \n \"Whenever, therefore, the profession of arms becomes a distinct order in the state. . .the end of the social compact is defeated. . . .No free government was ever founded, or ever preserved its liberty, without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for defense of the state. . . .Such a well regulated militia, composed of freeholders, citizens and husbandman, who take up arms to preserve their property, as individuals, and their rights as freemen.\" M. T. Cicero (a pseudonym), Charleston State Gazette, September 8, 1788.\n \n \"A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary. . . .the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia. . .and include. . .all men capable of bearing arms. . . . But, say gentlemen, the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns, cannot well be called out, or be depended upon; that we must have a select militia. . . .[of the select militia] These Corps, not much unlike regular troops, well ever produce an inattention to the general militia. . .whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them. . . .The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it.\" Richard Henry Lee, Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer, p. 169-170 (1788)\n \n \"The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\" Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300. (an early and well-respected American edition of Blackstone's work)\n \n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. The ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\" Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764.\n \n \"The power of the sword, say the minority of Pennsylvania, is in the hands of Congress. My friends and countrymen, it is not so, for the powers of the sword are in the hands of the yeomanry of America from sixteen to sixty. The militia of these free commonwealths, entitled and accustomed to their arms, when compared with any possible army, must be tremendous and irresistible. Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom? Congress shall have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birth-right of an American ....[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.\" Tench Coxe (federalist arguing for adoption of the federal constitution even though it did not contain a bill of rights), Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.\n \n \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive.\" Noah Webster (federalist arguing for adoption of the federal constitution even though it did not contain a bill of rights), \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n \n \"Is it necessary for your liberty, that you should abandon those great rights by the adoption of this system?. . . Will the abandonment of your most sacred rights tend to the security of your liberty?. . . .I am fearful I have lived long enough to become an old fashioned fellow: Perhaps an invincible attachment to the dearest rights of man, may, in these refined enlightened days, be deemed old fashioned: If so, I am contented to be so. . . . Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it, but downright force: Whenever you give up that force, you are inevitably ruined. . . .\n \n My great objection to this Government is, that it does not leave us the means of defending our rights; or, of waging war against tyrants. . . .\n \n The Honorable Gentleman who presides, told us, that to prevent abuses in our Government, we will assemble in Convention, recall our delegated powers, and punish our servants for abusing the trust reposed in them. Oh, Sir, we should have fine times indeed, if to punish tyrants, it were only sufficient to assemble the people. Your arms wherewith you could defend yourselves, are gone. . . . Did you ever read of any revolution in any nation, brought about by the punishment of those in power, inflicted by those who had no power at all? You read of a riot act in a country [England] which is called one of the freest in the world, where a few neighbors cannot assemble without the risk of being shot by hired soldiery, the engines of despotism. We may see such an act in America. A standing army we shall have also, to execute the execrable commands of tyranny: And how are you to punish them? Will you order them to be punished? Who shall obey these orders? Will your Mace-bearer be a match for a disciplined regiment? In what situation are we to be? . . . .What resistance could be made? The attempt would be madness.\" Patrick Henry, (anti-federalist arguing against adoption of a federal constitution without a bill of rights) Speeches of June 5 and 7, 1788, before the Virginia Ratifying Convention, reprinted in The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates, pages 199-216, Mentor Books, 1986, edited by Ralph Ketchum.\n \n \"And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the Press, or the rights of Conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms. . . .\" Samuel Adams, Debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87 (February 6, 1788).\n \n \"Mr. Madison has introduced his long expected amendments. . . .It contains a bill of rights [including] . . . .the right to keep and bear arms.\" Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 52-53 (1854) [Letter to Thomas Dwight, June 11, 1789].\n \n \"The rights of conscience, of bearing arms, of changing the government, are declared to be inherent in the people.\" Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 53-54 (1854) [Letter to F. I. Minoe, June 12, 1789].\n \n \"Last Monday, a string of amendments were presented to the lower house; these altogether respected personal liberty. . . .\" William Grayson, 3 Patrick Henry, p. 391 (1951) [letter from Grayson to Henry, June 12, 1789].\n \n \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.\" Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1. (explaining the 2nd. Amendment.)\n \n The militia preamble was included with the RKBA because the existence of the substantive right made possible the goal the founders sought of relying on a militia. The militia goal rides with the right and is a desired offshoot of its existence. It did not create the right, nor was it ever intended to limit it.\n \n It is merely a statement of one reason why the pre-existing individual RKBA must be recognized in the Constitution.",

   "Ah, but this long used method of statutory construction of Blackstone&#8217;s is only to be used &#8220;if words happen to be still dubious.&#8221; The paramount rule of interpretation is the assumption that the legislative body means exactly what it says&#8212;that we apply the plain meaning of language unless reading it this way leads to an absurd result. This rarely if ever happens. However, as Blackstone says, if after applying the plain meaning we discover the &#8220;words happen to be still dubious,&#8221; then and only then do we look outside the plain meaning for interpretive guidance. \n \n The language itself is not dubious or ambiguous: &#8220;A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.&#8221; It is nothing more than a preamble stating a universally held belief that standing armies, in times of peace, are dangerous to liberty (hence the use of the term &#8220;free state&#8221;).\n\n If there is anything dubious wording in the Second Amendment it would have to be \"bear arms\". In the 19th Century it became much more common for people to carry concealed pistols and knives for self defense. In response, many of the state governments passed laws to restrict the carrying of such weapons. There was a lot of debate about what was meant by the term \"bear arms\". If bear arms simply means carry a weapon then banning the carrying of such weapons would seem unjustifiable. The Founders spoke about such groups as Quakers who objected to bearing arms on religious grounds. These people kept and carried firearms for hunting so it seems that bear arms could not have simply referred to carrying a weapon. Quakers already did that. \n \n \n\n But if there is any concern about the goal behind the militia clause, then we need only take Blackstone&#8217;s advice and look at the words of the founders regarding this subject. Here are a few examples:\n \n &#8220;It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government, that a well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen.&#8221; John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)\n \n &#8220;Whenever, therefore, the profession of arms becomes a distinct order in the state. . .the end of the social compact is defeated. . . .No free government was ever founded, or ever preserved its liberty, without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for defense of the state. . . .Such a well regulated militia, composed of freeholders, citizens and husbandman, who take up arms to preserve their property, as individuals, and their rights as freemen.&#8221; M. T. Cicero (a pseudonym), Charleston State Gazette, September 8, 1788.\n \n &#8220;A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary. . . .the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia. . .and include. . .all men capable of bearing arms. . . . But, say gentlemen, the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns, cannot well be called out, or be depended upon; that we must have a select militia. . . .[of the select militia] These Corps, not much unlike regular troops, well ever produce an inattention to the general militia. . .whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them. . . .The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it.&#8221; Richard Henry Lee, Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer, p. 169-170 (1788)\n \n &#8220;The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.&#8221; Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300. (an early and well-respected American edition of Blackstone's work)\n \n &#8220;False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. The ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.&#8221; Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764.\n \n &#8220;The power of the sword, say the minority of Pennsylvania, is in the hands of Congress. My friends and countrymen, it is not so, for the powers of the sword are in the hands of the yeomanry of America from sixteen to sixty. The militia of these free commonwealths, entitled and accustomed to their arms, when compared with any possible army, must be tremendous and irresistible. Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom? Congress shall have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birth-right of an American ....[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.&#8221; Tench Coxe (federalist arguing for adoption of the federal constitution even though it did not contain a bill of rights), Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.\n \n &#8220;Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive.&#8221; Noah Webster (federalist arguing for adoption of the federal constitution even though it did not contain a bill of rights), \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n \n &#8220;Is it necessary for your liberty, that you should abandon those great rights by the adoption of this system?. . . Will the abandonment of your most sacred rights tend to the security of your liberty?. . . .I am fearful I have lived long enough to become an old fashioned fellow: Perhaps an invincible attachment to the dearest rights of man, may, in these refined enlightened days, be deemed old fashioned: If so, I am contented to be so. . . . Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it, but downright force: Whenever you give up that force, you are inevitably ruined. . . .\n \n My great objection to this Government is, that it does not leave us the means of defending our rights; or, of waging war against tyrants. . . .\n \n The Honorable Gentleman who presides, told us, that to prevent abuses in our Government, we will assemble in Convention, recall our delegated powers, and punish our servants for abusing the trust reposed in them. Oh, Sir, we should have fine times indeed, if to punish tyrants, it were only sufficient to assemble the people. Your arms wherewith you could defend yourselves, are gone. . . . Did you ever read of any revolution in any nation, brought about by the punishment of those in power, inflicted by those who had no power at all? You read of a riot act in a country [England] which is called one of the freest in the world, where a few neighbors cannot assemble without the risk of being shot by hired soldiery, the engines of despotism. We may see such an act in America. A standing army we shall have also, to execute the execrable commands of tyranny: And how are you to punish them? Will you order them to be punished? Who shall obey these orders? Will your Mace-bearer be a match for a disciplined regiment? In what situation are we to be? . . . .What resistance could be made? The attempt would be madness.&#8221; Patrick Henry, (anti-federalist arguing against adoption of a federal constitution without a bill of rights) Speeches of June 5 and 7, 1788, before the Virginia Ratifying Convention, reprinted in The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates, pages 199-216, Mentor Books, 1986, edited by Ralph Ketchum.\n \n &#8220;And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the Press, or the rights of Conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms. . . .&#8221; Samuel Adams, Debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87 (February 6, 1788).\n \n &#8220;Mr. Madison has introduced his long expected amendments. . . .It contains a bill of rights [including] . . . .the right to keep and bear arms.&#8221; Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 52-53 (1854) [Letter to Thomas Dwight, June 11, 1789].\n \n &#8220;The rights of conscience, of bearing arms, of changing the government, are declared to be inherent in the people.&#8221; Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 53-54 (1854) [Letter to F. I. Minoe, June 12, 1789].\n \n &#8220;Last Monday, a string of amendments were presented to the lower house; these altogether respected personal liberty. . . .&#8221; William Grayson, 3 Patrick Henry, p. 391 (1951) [letter from Grayson to Henry, June 12, 1789].\n \n &#8220;As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.&#8221; Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1. (explaining the 2nd. Amendment.)\n \n The militia preamble was included with the RKBA because the existence of the substantive right made possible the goal the founders sought of relying on a militia. The militia goal rides with the right and is a desired offshoot of its existence. It did not create the right, nor was it ever intended to limit it.\n \n It is merely a statement of one reason why the pre-existing individual RKBA must be recognized in the Constitution.\n\n Most of those quotes seem to connect the use of arms with a well regulated militia so I don't think they refute the civic rights view. As for the quote from Thomas Jefferson, some scholars like Cornell have pointed out that he was a radical in his own day and outside of the mainstream of thought about the Constitution.",

   "I wish to comment first on Galileo&#8217;s assertion that the term &#8220;bear arms&#8221; is of dubious meaning. \n \n I do not find the language &#8220;bear Arms&#8221; in any manner ambiguous. It is certainly no more ambiguous when we consider the phrase is &#8220;keep and bear arms.&#8221; In any event, I have long ago found what I believe to be the best definition of this phrase &#8220;bear arms,&#8221; which comes from Justice Ginsberg&#8217;s dissent in a case involving the definition of the word &#8220;carry&#8221; in a federal firearm regulation statute. Her definition was later cited with approval by the Heller majority. Some ten years before Heller, Justice Ginsberg said the following about the word &#8220;carry&#8221;:\n \n Surely a most familiar meaning is, as the Constitution's Second Amendment (&#8220;keep and bear Arms&#8221;) (emphasis added) and Black's Law Dictionary, at 214, indicate: &#8220;wear, bear, or carry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.&#8221; Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 143 (1998) (Ginsberg, dissenting) (emphasis on the word &#8220;bear&#8221; in the quote added in original and not by me)\n \n As for Cornell, I have considered his arguments at length elsewhere and found them to lack credibility. I am aware that he chooses to ignore the uncomfortable Mr. Jefferson by accusing him of being a &#8220;radical.&#8221; Would the phrase &#8220;Ad Hominem attack&#8221; have any application here?\n \n To answer Chester, I read the words &#8220;well-regulated&#8221; to mean, in effect, &#8220;well armed, well trained, well officered.&#8221; I agree the founders were wordsmiths, and they chose their language carefully.\n \n Now I would ask both of you, Chester and Galileo, to read the following and give me your thoughts: \n \n Does anyone here believe that the 2nd. Amendment &#8220;created&#8221; a right? \n \n Regarding the earlier quotes, they are a mixture of federalist and anti-federalist thought expressed during the ratification debates. Both sides speak passionately about the fear of a standing army and the goal of protecting liberty by relying instead on a militia. This is the thrust of the quotes&#8212;and it is the thought that forms the reason for including a militia preamble in both the state and federal constitutions. There is nothing contained within any of them which suggests the militia preamble creates and defines the scope of the pre-existing RKBA.\n \n I have dealt with the militia preamble before. The militia clause is nothing more than a restatement of the policy goal of protecting liberty by using militias and avoiding standing armies. I welcome your thoughts on my earlier musings on this preamble: \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/6957-revisiting-militia-clause.html\n \n In addition to what I have said earlier, let me make an additional argument. Here are four prior instances in which the words &#8220;well regulated militia&#8221; were used by our founders:\n \n CONSTITUTION OF VIRGINIA (June 6, 1776)\n \n That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty; and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\n \n DELAWARE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS (September 11, 1776)\n \n That a well-regulated militia is the proper, natural and safe defense of a free government. \n That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up without the consent of the legislature.\n \n CONSTITUTION OF MARYLAND (November 3, 1776)\n \n That a well-regulated militia is the proper and natural defense of a free government.\n That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up, without consent of the legislature.\n \n CONSTITUTION OF NEW HAMPSHIRE (June 2, 1784)\n \n A well-regulated militia is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a state.\n Standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up without the consent of the legislature.\n \n Each of these statements represents an expression of a policy goal, a universally believed truth, if you will: &#8220;Standing armies are a threat to liberty, and we should whenever possible avoid them and rely upon a militia.&#8221; That is all they are. Does Cornell, for example, argue that these are something more than policy statements?\n \n Now tell me what evidence exists to conclude that the inclusion of the same language later in the federal constitution is somehow different, that it now somehow takes on a life of its own and becomes the substantive right as opposed to a policy statement of how to best protect what Madison calls a &#8220;free&#8221; state?\n \n Or, in the alternative, let us consider how the wordsmith we know Madison to be used the same phrase &#8220;the right of the people&#8221; in the 1st., 2nd., and 4th. Amendments. How do we justify reading the same phrase &#8220;the right of the people&#8221; to protect an individual right in the 1st. amendment, then translate it into a collective right in the 2nd. Amendment, to then be returned to protecting an individual right in the 4th. Amendment?\n \n The anti-federalists I quoted earlier opposed a constitution which permitted the federal government to create a standing army, which they viewed as the engine of despotism. They particularly objected to the additional exclusive grant of federal power to also arm and equip the state militias. The state militias were seen as the counterbalance to the threat of a tyrant making use of a federal standing army. They complained that the federal government could disarm the militias merely by refusing to exercise its exclusive power to arm them. \n \n Now see the Federalist response of the man who ultimately came to author the 2nd. Amendment:\n \n \"Let a regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government; still it would not be going too far to say, that the State governments, with the people on their side, would be able to repel the danger. The highest number to which, according to the best computation, a standing army can be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This proportion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against the British arms, will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it. Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.\" James Madison, The Federalist Papers #46 , which can be viewed at: The Avalon Project : Federalist No 46\n \n Note that Madison makes mention of the one militia power solely reserved to the states by the constitution: the exclusive power to appoint the militia&#8217;s officers. (See Art. 1 Sec. 8) This was intended to ensure the militia&#8217;s command structure would always remain loyal to the states. \n \n But what about their arms? What happens if the federal government refuses to arm the militias? Everyone, whether federalist or anti-federalist, knew Article 1 sec. 8 of the federal constitution granted exclusive and complete authority to Congress for arming the militias. They also knew that if the federal government refused to arm the militias then the states are prohibited from doing so by the Article 6 supremacy clause of the federal constitution. As Patrick Henry argues, in such circumstances: &#8220;Will your mace-bearer be a match for disciplined regiment?&#8221; Or to read it another way: If the feds won&#8217;t arm the militias, and the states are prohibited by the constitution from doing it, then how can the states find a militia capable of defeating a tyrant? \n \n The federalists countered by noting the bulwark provided by the pre-existing RKBA. The federalists argued the people are already armed and as such are capable if called by the state to defeat a tyrant. (See for example Noah Webster and Tench Coxe.) This was a well-founded argument, for everyone understood that this was already the primary source of militia arms at the time: \n \n &#8220;[T]hat ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time.&#8221; United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 179 (1939).\n \n This is the crux of the Federalist argument, and why I believe Madison had to propose recognizing the RKBA in the Bill of Rights. The broader RKBA was already the well from which militia arms were historically drawn, and so long as the people have the RKBA then the states can in an emergency side-step the federal disarmament of the militias by making use of an armed populace to call forth an armed militia to defend against domestic tyranny. \n This individual RKBA&#8212;protected as such from federal interference&#8212;is exactly what Madison refers to when he says:\n \n &#8220;Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation&#8230;.Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.&#8221; \n \n Now for all of our rights the federalists further argued we needed no Bill or Rights protection because Congress was bound by specifically enumerated powers. This argument failed to assuage anti-federalists fears, however, and this is why Madison drafted and our forefathers ratified a Bill or Rights recognizing specific individual rights like speech, press, religion, and yes, the RKBA. \n \n The inclusion of the strongly preferred policy goal of relying on a &#8220;well-regulated militia&#8221; with the &#8220;right of the people to keep and bear arms&#8221; occurs because of the natural dependence of the one on the other: The &#8220;well-regulated militia&#8221; goal was ultimately dependent on the federal recognition and protection of the broader pre-existing individual RKBA. There is no credible evidence to suggest that the inclusion of this policy statement is the tail that wags the dog&#8212;it simply does not define and limit the individual right it relies upon for support no matter how much Cornell or others wish it to do so. \n \n ---\n \n &#8220;On every question of construction let us carry ourselves back to the time when the Constitution was adopted, recollect the spirit manifested in the debates, and instead of trying what meaning can be squeezed out of the text, or invented against it, conform to the probable one which was passed.&#8221; Thomas Jefferson, The Complete Jefferson, p. 322 (1957) [Letter to William Johnson, June 12, 1823].\n \n &#8220;Mr. Madison has introduced his long expected amendments. . . .It contains a bill of rights [including] . . . .the right to keep and bear arms.&#8221; Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 52-53 (1854) [Letter to Thomas Dwight, June 11, 1789].\n \n &#8220;The rights of conscience, of bearing arms, of changing the government, are declared to be inherent in the people.&#8221; Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 53-54 (1854) [Letter to F. I. Minoe, June 12, 1789].\n \n &#8220;As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.&#8221; Tench Coxe, describing the proposed 2nd. Amendment in his Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1.\n \n &#8220;It has appeared to me that a few well tempered observations on these propositions might have good effect. . . .It may perhaps be of use in the present turn of the public opinions in New York State. . . .&#8221; Tench Coxe, 12 Madison Papers, pp. 239-240 (Rutland Ed. 1979) [Letter from Coxe to Madison, June 18, 1789].\n \n &#8220;[Your] printed remarks enclosed are already I find in the Gazettes here. . . .[my proposed amendments are] therefore already indebted to the co-operation of your pen.&#8221; James Madison, 12 Madison Papers, p. 257 (Rutland Ed. 1979) [Letter from Madison to Coxe, June 24, 1789].",

When the Athenians decided to force Socrates to develop a taste for Hemlock they conveniently forgot to take into account his earlier exemplary service in their citizen's militia.\n \n I also recall Aristotle commenting in favor of individual citizens having a RKBA: \"For those who can possess and wield arms are in a position to decide whether the constitution is to continue or not.\" Aristotle, Politics, T. Sinclair Trans. 1962, p. 274. \n \n I think we must agree to disagree over the implications of my historical analysis. In my opinion, the individual RKBA existed long before the nation was founded. The right did not contain a duty to provide militia service as condition for its free exercise. Nothing said by the founders indicates an intention to modify this broader pre-existing RKBA by limiting it only to a military service context. \n \n But since the \"well regulated militia\" has proved an interesting topic to start the new year on, let us return to the specific militia power complaint of Patrick Henry:\n \n \"A standing army we shall have, also, to execute the execrable commands of tyranny; and how are you to punish them? Will you order them to be punished? Who shall obey these orders? Will your mace-bearer be a match for a disciplined regiment? In what situation are we to be? The clause before you gives a power of direct taxation, unbounded and unlimited, exclusive power of legislation, in all cases whatsoever, for ten miles square, and over all places purchased for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, &c. What resistance could be made? The attempt would be madness. You will find all the strength of this country in the hands of your enemies; their garrisons will naturally be the strongest places in the country. Your militia is given up to Congress, also, in another part of this plan: they will therefore act as they think proper: all power will be in their own possession. You cannot force them to receive their punishment: of what service would militia be to you, {52} when, most probably, you will not have a single musket in the state? for, as arms are to be provided by Congress, they may or may not furnish them.\n \n Let me here call your attention to that part which gives the Congress power \"to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States - reserving to the states, respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.\" By this, sir, you see that their control over our last and best defence is unlimited. If they neglect or refuse to discipline or arm our militia, they will be useless: the states can do neither - this power being exclusively given to Congress. The power of appointing officers over men not disciplined or armed is ridiculous; so that this pretended little remains of power left to the states may, at the pleasure of Congress, be rendered nugatory.\"\n June 5, 1788 Virgina Ratifying Convention: June 5, 1788\n \n Here is Henry's anti-federalist complaint: Congress assumes and the states lose all power to arm the militias under this proposed constitution. Congress can therefore destroy the militias simply by refusing to exercise its exclusive authority to arm them. How can we defend ourselves if the feds deny us arms?\n \n Or, let me ask it this way: If the federal government refuses to provide arms for the militias, and the state governments are forbidden to provide them, then what will be the source of all these arms that federalists like Madison, Noah Webster, Tench Coxe, Hamilton, and others tell us we already have and can use in an emergency defense against the threat of federal tyranny? \n \n Without a doubt the source is the pre-existing individual RKBA.\n \n That was the federalist response: Everyone already has arms-this fact of an armed populace already acts to deter the ambitions of a tyrant-and the states can dip into this armed pool if necessary as a substitute for the arms congress denies them.\n \n And here is where the broader context of the individual RKBA can be missed: The anti-federalists speak almost exclusively of their fear of losing the armed militia. In response the federalists attempt to smother their militia fears by throwing the larger blanket protection offered by an individual RKBA over the problem-The citizens have an individual right to keep and bear these arms, both in theory and in actual fact, and they know how to use them to protect their liberties. The federalists did not try to shrink the right in the dryer beforehand to make it fit only the anti-federalist militia fear. \n \n I have yet to hear a single quote offered from a single founder suggesting that the response to the anti-federalists was to launch a new individual RKBA limited to those performing militia service. \n \n Finally, remember also that the Federalists promised a subsequent amendment process to include protection for a list of pre-existing individual rights--like the RKBA they agreed already existed and which in their opinion adequately dealt with Patrick Henry's fears. \n \n Henry's answer was this:\n \n \"But I should be led to take that man for a lunatic, who should tell me to run into the adoption of a government avowedly defective, in hopes of having it amended afterwards. Were I about to give away the meanest particle of my own property, I should act with more prudence and discretion. My anxiety and fears are great lest America, by the adoption of this system, should be cast into a fathomless bottom.\" June 9, 1788. Virgina Ratifying Convention: June 9, 1788\n \n Fortunately for me and others in my country Henry did not prove to be a true prophet. The federalists, led by Madison, kept their promise: \n \n \"Last Monday, a string of amendments were presented to the lower house; these altogether respected personal liberty. . . .\" William Grayson, 3 Patrick Henry, p. 391 (1951) [letter from Grayson to Henry, June 12, 1789].\n \n One of those pre-existing individual rights chosen for protection was what Madison previously described as \"the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation....\"\n \n Now the counter argument which you offer, Chester, appears to concede that the individual RKBA exists but argues further that the founder's intention was to limit it and require militia service as a pre-requisite for exercising this right. (and would it, in your view, be limited to \"bearing\" only while engaged in the militia service?) \n \n To return to the original explanation of the 2nd. Amendment-an explanation favored by the amendment's author-and one much ignored by those wishing to re-translate the right in modern times:\n \n \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.\" Tench Coxe, describing the proposed 2nd. Amendment in his Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1.\n \n Nothing within this statement suggests a requirement of militia service. Note also that Coxe says \"confirmed\" and not \"granted.\" The 2nd. Amendment merely confirms the existence of the broader individual right \"to keep and bear their private arms\"--it did not replace this right with a more limited one bound by the restriction of militia service.\n \n Does not your argument suggest that an Amendment within the Bill of Rights was actually intended to take away a pre-existing right of the people and replace it with something far more restrictive-that an amendment was intended to take away individual freedom? \n \n Is there one source which I have cited, or even one source I may have neglected, which you would point to and say \"this definitively shows the founders decided to take the broader pre-existing individual RKBA and shackle it to the necessity of making militia service a pre-requisite for its free exercise\"?",

   "Galileo,\n I find it interesting that you are trying to quote the founding fathers to support a position that the RKBA is not an individual right. Good Luck with that. Here is a few quotes you won't want to use:\n \n \nNo Free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.\" (Thomas Jefferson, Proposal to Virginia Constitution, 1 T. Jefferson Papers, 334,[C.J. Boyd, Ed., 1950] )\n \n Laws that forbid the carrying of arms...disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes.... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.&#8221; (Jefferson's \"Commonplace Book,\" 1774-1776, quoting from On Crimes and Punishment, by criminologist Cesare Beccaria, 1764)\n \n \"The thoughtful reader may wonder, why wasn't Jefferson's proposal of &#8216;No freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms&#8217; adopted by the Virginia legislature? They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\" (Benjamin Franklin, Historical Review of Pennsylvania, 1759.)\n \n \"Resistance to sudden violence, for the preservation not only of my person, my limbs, and life, but of my property, is an indisputable right of nature which I have never surrendered to the public by the compact of society, and which perhaps, I could not surrender if I would.\" (John Adams, Boston Gazette, Sept. 5, 1763, reprinted in The Works of John Adams 438 [Charles F. Adams ed., 1851])\n \n \"Arms in the hands of individual citizens may be used at individual discretion in private self-defense.\" (John Adams, A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America [1787-1788])\n \n \"The Constitution shall never be construed...to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms.\" (Samuel Adams, Debates and Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87)\n \n \"Are we at last brought to such humiliating and debasing degradation, that we cannot be trusted with arms for our defense? Where is the difference between having our arms in possession and under our direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?\" (Patrick Henry, 3 J.

Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are inevitably ruined\" (Patrick Henry, 3 J.

It is the whole people, except for few public officials.\" (George Mason, 3 Elliot, Debates at 425-426)\n\n \n There is lots more where these came from.

   "And who is it @1790 that said the right of the people to bear arms ONLY related to active duty militia members? \n \n \n It makes little sense to argure ambiguity and precision at the same time, but that is what Cornell does. His argument is internally inconsistent in that in an effort to undermine the standard model, he argues that there was no agreement on what the RKBA meant, but then he proposes a narrow/exclusive right which would reguire more, not less, precision -though he can not cite even one person from that time articulating such a narrow right. \n \n \n Why would one assume that the civics rights model, which demands exclusivity, is to be favored over the standard model which does not ? Note that the standard model encompasses a right to keep and bear arms for one's own defense as well as to contribute to the common defense so is consistent with various statements from that time (i.e. see Bryan's non-exhaustive list of citations from that era). However the civic rights model proposed by Cornell does not fit with what was said by J.Wilson, R,Sherman, and other framers.\n\n Most of the quotes I've read from that time period and that have been posted in this forum associate the right with a militia. A plain reading of the Second Amendment shows that the preamble does not say, \"Self defense being important to personal security\" rather it talks about the importance of a militia. I don't think anyone has addressed my point about 19th Century state courts' debate about the meaning of \"bear arms\" or how conscientous objectors were religiously scrupulous of bearing arms. The Miller Court said that the declaration and guarantee of the Second Amendment should be read with the militia end in view. So the way I see it personal self defense is either peripheral or irrelevant to the right protected by the Second Amendment. Either way it makes no sense to say that a ban on handguns is not okay but a ban on machine guns is okay as the Court did. A plain reading of the Second Amendment indicates that the opposite is much more likely to be true. Scholars have been debating about whether or not the right can be limited by its preamble, but the bizarre thing about the Supreme Court ruling is that they let the right be limited by what is not even in the text of the Second Amendment- the words \"in common use\". Apparently, they felt those words were of more importance in interpreting the Second Amendment than actual text of the Second Amendment it its preamble.",

They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\" (Benjamin Franklin, Historical Review of Pennsylvania, 1759.)\n\n It looks like to me Franklin is saying that the Virginia legislature disagreed with Jefferson's proposal to protect a right to own arms because they valued safety more. That's one of the reasons some scholars have called Jefferson a radical and outside of the Constitutional mainstream of thought. \n \n \n\n \"Resistance to sudden violence, for the preservation not only of my person, my limbs, and life, but of my property, is an indisputable right of nature which I have never surrendered to the public by the compact of society, and which perhaps, I could not surrender if I would.\" (John Adams, Boston Gazette, Sept. 5, 1763, reprinted in The Works of John Adams 438 [Charles F.

Rejected proposals are more likely to show what 18th Century Americans disagreed with rather than what they agree with. \n \n \n\n \"Are we at last brought to such humiliating and debasing degradation, that we cannot be trusted with arms for our defense? Where is the difference between having our arms in possession and under our direction, and having them under the management of Congress?

Elliot, Debates in the Several State Conventions 45, 2d ed. Philadelphia, 1836)\n \n\n He is complaining about the possibility of Congress rather than the state legislatures having control over the arms of the militia. \n The quote in more context reads:\n \"These depositories for arms, though within the state, will be free from the control of its legislature. Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation, that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defence? Where is the difference between having our arms in our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defence be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands? If our legislature be unworthy of legislating for every foot in this state, they are unworthy of saying another word. The clause which says that Congress shall 'provide for arming, organizing, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively the appointment of the officers,' seemed to put the states in the power of Congress.\"\n \n [QUOTE=Lurch907;339073]\n \"Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are inevitably ruined\" (Patrick Henry, 3 J.

Philadelphia, 1836)\n \n \n\n \"...to disarm the people &#8213; that was the best and most effectual way to enslave them.\" (George Mason, 3 Elliot, Debates at 380)\n\n In more context:\n \n \"But when once a standing army is established in any country, the people lose their liberty. When, against a regular and disciplined army, yeomanry are the only defence,&#8212; yeomanry, unskilful and unarmed,&#8212; what chance is there for preserving freedom? Give me leave to recur to the page of history, to warn you of your present danger. Recollect the history of most nations of the world. What havoc, desolation, and destruction, have been perpetrated by standing armies! An instance within the memory of some of this house will show us how our militia may be destroyed. Forty years ago, when the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man, who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them; but that they should not do it openly, but weaken them, and let them sink gradually, by totally disusing and neglecting the militia.\"\n - George Mason, Virginia Ratifying Convention, 1778\n He associates the right with a militia and talks about the importance of government not neglecting the militia. In that time period it was thought that government had to take a proactive role in arming and militarily perparing the citizen militia. Failure to do so would lead to an ineffective militia and thus the nation would be forced to rely on a standing army and the evils associated with it. Joseph Story speaks more about importance of this:\n \n \"And yet, though this truth would seem so clear, and the importance of a well regulated militia would seem so undeniable, it cannot be disguised, that among the American people there is a growing indifference to any system of militia discipline, and a strong disposition, from a sense of it burdens, to be rid of all regulations. How it is practicable to keep the people duly armed without some organization, it is difficult to see. There is certainly no small danger, that indifference may lead to disgust, and disgust to contempt; and thus gradually undermine all the protection intended by the clause of our national bill of rights.\" \n \n \n\n \"I ask, sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people, except for few public officials.\" (George Mason, 3 Elliot, Debates at 425-426) \n \n\n In more context:\n \"I ask, Who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers. But I cannot say who will be the militia of the future day. If that paper on the table gets no alteration, the militia of the future day may not consist of all classes, high and low, and rich and poor; but they may be confined to the lower and middle classes of the people, granting exclusion to the higher classes of the people.\"\n \n By \"that paper\" he means Article 1 of the Constitution. He's saying that Article 1 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to decide who is in the militia and who is not in the militia and thus Congress could unfairly exempt \"the higher classes of the people\" from militia duty.",

   "Let me address the Miller decision since it came up again and a new thought hit me that I want to float here:\n \n SCOTUS explained its ruling thus-\"In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\"\n \n This pronouncement was a little late for Miller and his co-defendant, Frank Layton. They could not have known of the need to present such evidence to the trial court at their demurrer hearing. This of course leads to a Due Process problem in which defendant's could complain \"how am I to know what evidence you think you I need if you won't tell me until after my hearing?\"\n \n This is why the Miller decision ends with this statement:\n \n \"We are unable to accept the conclusion of the court below and the \n challenged judgment must be reversed. The cause will be remanded for further proceedings.\" (bold emphasis by Bryan) \n \n The is typical of SCOTUS' way of saying \"We send the case back to the District Court for prosecution if the government is so inclined, and you all know what the standard is now.\"\n \n But by this time Miller was dead, and there is no known (at least to me) record of whether Frank Layton attempted to prove the shotgun could be \"part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\" He would have had ample evidence, with proof existing that the Federal Government purchased some 30,000 sawed-off shotguns for use in WWI. However, my guess is he plea bargained his case since records show he received a sentence of probation only with no active jail sentence.\n \n Now here is my thought balloon question which I confess I do not have the answer to: After Miller was decided, did anyone thereafter try to meet the Miller standard? To put it another way-Has anyone charged with possessing an illegal weapon ever tried to prove his weapon \"is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense\"?\n \n I know no such case ever made it back to SCOTUS before Heller changed everything.\n \n It would be curious to see what a lower court did with such a claim.\n \n ---\n \n The issue, however, is not whether court rules are \"mutable\"; they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of \"various circumstances,\" they can be \"modifi[ed]\"; they assuredly can. The issue is whether, as mutated and modified, they must make sense. The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.

   "\n Does anyone here believe that the 2nd. Amendment &#8220;created&#8221; a right?\n\n No, I don't think so. Cornell talks about the existence of the right to bear arms before the Second Amendment and how it was distinct from the individual right of personal self defense:\n \n &#8220;Blackstone&#8217;s fifth auxiliary right was legally distinct from the individual right of personal self defense, and the two were treated separately in his influential legal treatise, Commentaries on the Laws of England. The former was a political right embodied in the English Declaration of Rights and was clearly linked to a particular civic purpose. The latter was one of the many rights that had slowly evolved under common law, the body of cases that English courts had adjudicated over the course of several centuries and that contained the bulk of English legal doctrine. Most important natural rights, including the right of self-defense, had been modified by the common law. Thus, once men left the state of nature and entered civil society, they renounced the untrammeled right of self-defense. &#8216;The law requires,&#8217; Blackstone declared, &#8216;that the person who kills another in his own defense, should have retreated as far as he conveniently or safely can, to avoid the violence of the assault, before he turns upon his assailant.&#8217; Flight, not armed confrontation, was the legal obligation of English subjects when faced with a threat to personal safety. Indeed, Blackstone contrasted the obligation to stand and fight incumbent upon subjects in time of war, which would have included militiamen bearing arms, with the legal requirement enjoining civilians to retreat to the wall before responding with deadly force to an attack. Another important legal distinction between these two rights related to the power of the state: government could compel individuals to bear arms for public defense but could not force individuals to arm themselves for personal defense.&#8221;\n (A Well-Regulated Militia, pages 15,16)\n \n He goes on to explain how this view of the right to bear arms is supported by the early state constitutions in America:\n \n &#8220;None of the early state constitutions adopted language protecting an individual right to keep or carry arms for personal self-defense. Efforts were made to protect such a right in both Virginia and Massachusetts [referring to Jefferson&#8217;s and Adams&#8217; rejected proposals], but in the end neither state chose to adopt an explicit statement protecting the right of self-defense. It would take another four decades before any state would explicitly affirm such a right. The right of individual self-defense would remain a matter of common law, not constitutional law.&#8221;\n (A Well-Regulated Militia, pages 18,19)",

   "Most of the quotes I've read from that time period and that have been posted in this forum associate the right with a militia. A plain reading of the Second Amendment shows that the preamble does not say, \"Self defense being important to personal security\" rather it talks about the importance of a militia. .\n\n \n As noted by the majority opinion in Heller, the clause of the PA constitution protecting the right to bear arms does not even mention the militia. Other states adopted the PA model nearly word for word. So it can hardly be said that the RKBA as it was known @1790 existed only in regards to the organized militia. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n I don't think anyone has addressed my point about 19th Century state courts' debate about the meaning of \"bear arms\" or how conscientous objectors were religiously scrupulous of bearing arms. The Miller Court said that the declaration and guarantee of the Second Amendment should be read with the militia end in view. So the way I see it personal self defense is either peripheral or irrelevant to the right protected by the Second Amendment.\n\n \n Quakers would not bear arms in defense of themselves, OR the state. A person who would use arms in his own defense but refused to contribute to the common defense would not be seen as a CO. The Quakers got a pass because they were consistent. \n \n That the Miller court said the 2nd amednment must be \"read with that end in view\" does not mean that there is no individual right to self defense protected by the 2nd, or that the right to bear arms for self defense is merely peripheral. Note that the government's brief in Miller admitted that some states protected an individual RKBA for self defense but none-the-less such states required that the arms kept must be of the types used in civilized warfare, not the types used by common criminals. The Miller decision hinged on the type of weapon, not the active duty status of the accused.",

I do not believe this statute supports your position that militia service was a requirement of the individual RKBA. \n \n The Act is unique. It has nothing to do with the individual RKBA. It is instead a war time measure which imposed a duty on every male to arm himself with a standardized set of military equipment (certain males were exempt) and thereafter to render militia service. The Act's preamble sets forth the emergency situation (my politically incorrect grade school textbooks called this the \"French and Indian War\"):\n \n \"Whereas in this time of actual war with the French King and\n his subjects and his savage Indian Allies, it is absolutely necessary\n for the service of our most Gracious Sovereign....\"\n \n But more importantly I found the militia enrolment list had nothing to do with gun owners. It did not mention gun owners at all, nor did it require or even imply a requirement of militia service as a condition of choosing to exercise your RKBA. The Act begins with nothing more than a simple census of every age-appropriate male--ordered performed by each county sheriff and his elected assistant; who in accordance with the Act:\n \n \"shall take down in writing the names and surnames of every male person residing in the said township, boroughs or wards (servants and apprentices excepted) above the age of seventeen and under fifty-five years, noting against every name to what religious society each person belongs, especially such as are papists or reputed papists....\"\n \n The Act then imposed a duty-irrespective of the individual RKBA-on each person so identified by the census (excluding the dreaded papists and the less dreaded conscientious objectors) to provide themselves with the following armament:\n \n \"And be it enacted, That every of the persons so as aforesaid enrolled, not conscientiously scrupling the use of arms, shall be sufficiently armed with one good musket, fuzee or other firelock well fixed, a cutlass, bayonet or tomahawk, a cartouch box, filled with twelve or more cartridges of powder, twelve or more sizeable bullets, and three good flints, and shall appear and attend in their proper persons with the accoutrements, arms and ammunition aforesaid in good order, on the first Mondays in the months of June....\"\n \n The Act further commanded that if any person appeared for muster without these items then he was subject to a fine-unless it appeared he was incapable of providing them for himself (ie. could not afford them), in which case if his hardship were believed then he was excused the fine and the state would provide the arms for him:\n \n \"And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if the captain, lieutenant and ensign or any two of them, shall adjudge any person or persons enrolled as aforesaid, and appearing on the days of muster hereinbefore-appointed, to be incapable of providing and furnishing him or themselves with the arms, ammunition and accoutrements required by this act, every such person so appearing shall be exempt from the fines and forfeitures imposed by virtue of this act until such arms, ammunition and accoutrements shall be provided for and delivered to him.\"\n \n But regardless of whether he could afford them or got them as a state poor man's hand-out, each person enrolled was further obligated to keep these militia arms in his private residence and in a state of readiness: \n \n \"And be it further enacted, That every person so as aforesaid enrolled shall, at all times during the continuance of this act, keep by him in his dwelling house, the arms and accoutrements aforesaid in good order and fit for immediate service, in case of any sudden invasion, insurrection or rebellion, under the like penalty of four shillings for every such neglect or offense.\"\n \n I can find nothing in this act which supports the position that militia service was a condition of the free exercise of your RKBA. The act stepped outside the individual RKBA by first imposing a duty of universal and standardized military firearm ownership and then imposed a militia duty. \n \n The act did not prohibit possession of any other arms not required for militia service, nor did it prohibit the possession of arms for private use-by Protestants, that is. Interestingly, the Act also required the complete disarmament of \"Papists\"-all arms and gun powder were prohibited to them, and they were required on penalty of imprisonment to surrender any firearms and powder they already held. In this sense the Act tracked exactly with the RKBA provision of the English Bill of Rights of 1689. \n \n But the Act did nothing to touch the already privately held arms of Protestants-except for an attempt to recover the many militia arms which, having been previously bought at government expense, had apparently already been illegally misappropriated to private use (and here we thought this kind of thing only happened to government property sent for use in Iraq). \n \n The Act did nothing to prohibit other purchases of firearms for private use. It did nothing to prohibit the required militia arms from being used in private concerns (such as hunting) so long as the arms were kept in a state of constant readiness for emergency militia use. The act most certainly did not focus on gun owners and impose upon them choice of accepting militia service or surrendering their arms. While the Act exempted persons other than \"Papists\" from militia service (those unfit and \"apprentices\", for example), the Act did not require them to surrender their right to keep and bear private arms as a result of failing to provide militia service. The Act merely took an extraordinary war-time emergency position of requiring that every capable male provide himself with an additional standardized set of military equipment-whether he is already privately exercising his RKBA or not. \n \n Now, if we really want to know if the colonists were required to either accept militia service or surrender their RKBA, then we need to ask whether the government required those who had armed themselves pursuant to the Act to surrender their arms after the conclusion of the war and their militia service ended. We need to know whether the government forbad the possession of any other firearms not listed within the Act's military equipment list. We need to know whether the government prohibited these men from taking arms they purchased in a time of war and using them privately once peace was established. We need to know whether the government would have required men who \"aged out of\" the militia requirement to surrender all of their arms-or at least those listed as military equipment by the Act. This, perhaps, would be evidence of a desire to link the RKBA to a requirement of militia service, but such evidence does not exist.\n \n If my government today passed a militia act which enabled and required me to arm myself with an M-4 rifle and ammo and then required me to render militia service, then this would be an exercise of permitted governmental power. But there simply is no evidence, whether within the above-quoted militia act or from any other source, to suggest that exercising my RKBA by itself requires that I give militia service.",
