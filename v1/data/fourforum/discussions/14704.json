   "im a vegetarian. have been for about 5-6 years, and i was recently confronted by a friend who asked why i was a vegetarian. i told him its because i value life too much to cause harm and death. then it occurred to me that eating a vegetable causes death also - not harm, necessarily, but you cant put value on a life depending on whether it feels harm or not. harm is just a series of nerve reactions and doesnt really have anything to do with the importance of life, other than for danger warnings.\n \n then i started thinking about it even further, in that there are microorganisms, prokaryotic and eukaryotic all over the place, and we all eat a substantial amount of them every day - to say a vegetarian eats only fruits and vegetables is quite wrong.\n \n despite all this, i find it interesting how something like a cat or a horse is given a higher life value than a cow or pig. im sure horse meat tastes awesome. maybe because cats and dogs are cute and lovable, so we feel bad about eating them, and things like chickens and pigs and cows are butt-ugly so eating them is fine. or maybe because chickens or pigs dont respond to humans in the same way that domesticated animals do.\n \n also an interesting thing is when i hear about people who eat rabbit stew and then feel really bad afterwards because theyre sad about the rabbit. why? whats the difference in eating a rabbit or eating a cow?\n \n anyways, i suppose the question is what gives a life value, or why do we humans give value to certain life over others?\n \n why is a cat given more value than a cockroach?",
