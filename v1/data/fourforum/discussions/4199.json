   "I believe the cell phone is one of the best tools young people can have now for personal protection . If they get in trouble, most of the time they have time to call for help. But, having students abide by rules stating \" All cell phones shall remain OFF while on school property \", would not be enforcable and ignored at best. Simply because of the eminent disruptive aspect of the use of cell phones in class or on buses, I would vote no cell phones, jmo",

I think you missed the previous post Tigerlilly--It's all fine and dandy to say that \"as long as you aren't using the phone in class\" it should be okay, but you know as well as I do that people leave them on anyway.\n If you think you should be able to have them and leave them off during class and only use them as an absolute neccessity, than have some sense and do so.",

   "Of course I think cell phones should be turned off during the school day, I do think that they should be able to call during lunch, but I really don't care about that. The one time it matters is after-school activities and getting a ride. I live a good 45 minutes away from school and when traffic is bad it can be easily over an hour. I play baseball so we practice every day after school. If my parent is stuck in traffic they can leave a message saying \"I'll probably be there at whatever time\" and then I can go in and do homework until they get here.\n \n Currently our school policy is no phones during the school day, not even during lunch. Of course you can use the pay phones during lunch. I'm not sure but I wouldn't be surprised if some of that is because of money, but I really don't care because I don't see a need for cell phones during lunch anyway. If a cell phone goes off the teacher takes it and then the parent has to go in to get it back. The teacher tells the parent about the policy and that the kid's phone was on before giving it back.\n \n \n The one other problem with cell phones is there is a problem with text message cheating. I've never actually seen anyone do it and I would think it would be easy to catch but there was a recent newspaper article about it and they said it was a big problem.",

   "zachvac, some South Korean university students were doing it big time. Can't blame the rest of the world's reputable school systems from trying to stop what is eventually comming. It's actually very simple with camera phones. \n \n My former university professors used to answer any phone that went off. Hysterical. That taught kids not to turn them on in class.",

   "Handphones? Cellphones? emoticon_frazzled They're called mobile phones people. :p \n \n \n You can't make calls (other than pranks) in class. But can sure as hell send sms and mms. Or whatever else you might be able to do in terms of games, radio transmitter/receiver, internet and so forth.\n \n I remember my old school initially tried banning phones outright, if you were caught with your phone then it would get confiscated until you paid a fairly hefty fine. This wasn't really working so they introduced a \"registration\" in which you could register your phone, registered phones were OK to have on your person as long as they weren't on.\n \n This didn't really work either, as nobody bothered to register.\n \n EDIT: Ah I've just remembered that camera phones were banned outright. The teachers were worried about pictures being taken of them, if you catch my drift.\n \n People used their phones fairly freely in school, and during break in full view of the teachers. Lunch was a non-issue as everyone goes into town for lunch. No loser canteen food for us.\n \n It might have gotten stricter since though, they were getting pretty heavy on the discipline as I was leaving the school: IE cameras everywhere, ID cards for all students (that one has to swipe in the doors to get into school_ etc...",

   "I think they should not be allowed in the classroom. Outside of class, fine, if you're late for class you're responsible for what you've missed. However, in a lecture hall of 2-300 students, all taking a test, and one student forgets to turn off his phone and he gets a call it breaks everyone's concentration. It's also very disrespectful to a professor or a teacher to have a phone ring in the middle of his/her lecture. The easy solution is to just turn them all off, but there's always that one student who doesn't.",

   "There is an old saying that says \"It's all fun until some one gets hurt.\" They can't completely bann the phones until they are used as a weapon. Hey, the flatter they get, it might be easier to stab with. I'm joking here. There is no way for teachers to keep students from having phones go off. They always go off and especially when you don't want them too. I would assume for any student who doesn't have the phone it's better for one to go off in class then at the movies. In middle school and high school, students should be able to turn them off and leave them in their lockers. If they are in elementary school, there should be no need for them to have a phone. If there is an emergency, the school has the ability to get a hold of the parents. If they are in college, they should know enogh by then to turn them off before class. I as a college student myself currently, knows that doesn't always happen. But we (saying as a college student) should know to turn them off before class. But in college, there is more of a need to have a cell phone. Now was this thread meant to include all schools or just elementary through high schools? If so, then disregard everything I said about college. But we do have that problem of remembering to turn cell phones off. All I can say is maybe download a ringtone to a song that the teacher likes, then you might get away with it. :p Once again, just joking.",
