   "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/business/17bear.html\n \n \nJPMorgan Chase Buying Bear Stearns for $2 a Share\n \n In the deal crafted on Sunday for Bear Stearns, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay a mere $2 a share for Bear - less than one-tenth the firm's market price on Friday. As part of the deal, JPMorgan and the Federal Reserve will guarantee the enormous trading obligations of the troubled firm, which was driven to the brink of bankruptcy by what amounted to a bank run.\n\n \n \nThe deal for Bear, done at the behest of the Fed and the Treasury Department, punctuates the stunning downfall of one of Wall Street's biggest and most storied firms. Bear had weathered the vagaries of the markets for 85 years, surviving the Depression and a dozen recessions only to meet its end in the rapidly unfolding credit crisis now afflicting the American economy.\n\n \n Bear Sterns had a much better balance sheet than msot of our other big banks. \n \n This is history in the making. Not only ha BS pretty much failed, the FED is providing guarantees on $30 billion of its assets. Also worth noting is that they had to lend JP morgan the purchase price as well. JP Morgan could not come up with $236 million???\n \n It is a good time to own gold, or euros, or pretty much anything but dollars, and you might check your supplies of lead and brass as well. This is one of the most butt ugly situations I have ever seen in the financial world. I just saw Paulson on TV urging people to remain calm and avoid bank runs. When was the last time the treasure secretary had to do that (1929???)?",

Only Congress could make an organization like the PCAOB that literally has made 5 auditing standard in 5 years yet their average salary is $250,000 there.
