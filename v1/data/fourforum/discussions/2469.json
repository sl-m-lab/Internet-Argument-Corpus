   "Subject: U.S. Senator Zell Miller Democrat from GA.\n \n \n 'Outraged by the outrage over the Abu Ghraib prison issue' is a good way of\n putting it in my estimation...Dee\n \n \n Subject: U.S. Senator Zell Miller Democrat from GA.\n \n U.S. Senator Zell Miller\n Floor Statement on the Situation at Abu Ghraib prison\n Remarks as Delivered on the Senate Floor\n \n Mr. President, here we go again, here we go again.\n \n Rushing to give aid and comfort to the enemy.\n \n Pushing and pulling and shoving and leaping over one another to assign blame\n and point the finger at America the Terrible.\n \n Lining up in long lines at the microphones to offer apologies to those poor,\n pitiful Iraqi prisoners.\n \n Of course, I do not condone all the things that went on in that prison, but\n I for one, Mr. President, refuse to join in this national Act of Contrition\n over it.\n \n Those who are wringing their hands and shouting so loudly for \"heads to\n roll\" over this seem to have conveniently overlooked the fact that someone'\n s head HAS rolled - that of another innocent American brutally murdered by\n terrorists.\n \n Why is it? Why is it that there's more indignation over a photo of a\n prisoner with underwear on his head than over the video of a young American\n with no head at all?\n \n Why is it that some in this country still don't get that we are at war? A\n war against terrorists who are plotting to kill us every day. Terrorists who\n will murder Americans at any time any place any chance they get.\n \n And yet here we are, America on its knees, in front of our enemy, begging\n for their forgiveness over the mistreatment of prisoners.\n \n Showing the enemy and the world once again how easily America can get\n sidetracked and how easily America can turn against it self.\n \n Yes, some of our soldiers went too far with their interrogation tactics and\n clearly were not properly trained to handle such duty.\n \n But the way to deal with this is with swift and sure punishment, and\n immediate and better training.\n \n There also needs to be more careful screening of who it is we put in these\n kinds of sensitive situations.\n \n And no one wants to hear this, Mr. President and I'm reluctant to say it.\n But there should also be some serious questioning of having male and female\n soldiers serving side by side in these kinds of military missions.\n \n But instead, I worry that the HWA - the Hand-Wringers of America - will add\n to their membership and continue to bash our country ad nauseam. And in\n doing so, hand over more innocent Americans to the enemy on a silver\n platter.\n \n So I stand with Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma, who stated that he's \"more\n outraged by the outrage\" than by the treatment of those prisoners.\n \n More outraged by the outrage. It's a good way of putting it. That's exactly\n how this Senator from Georgia feels.\n \n Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

My question to you would be this: in fifteen years, if Iraq has become a stable, democratic nation, and they can fully govern and defend themselves, would you then consider the invasion to have been a good thing? Is your objection to the war the way it's going now, or the idea itself, to depose Saddam and institute a free democracy?",

In knee-jerk fashion, liberal ideology requires its adherent to excuse the bad behavior of lowly groups, not matter how horrible, and to aggressively condemn the misdeeds of powerful groups, no matter how minor. And really it's not even powerful groups they hate; it is anyone that fits the image of someone on the Right. To the liberal mind, the military feels like a conservative institution and the U.S. is a country of right-wingers, so the misdeeds of American soliders are uniquely evil.",

   "With all due respect, you guys keep missing my point (over and over again). I'm not against using military aggression when it is absolutely necessary to defend the United States of America and it's people. What I'm against is a very expensive, poorly calculated invasion of a sovereign nation that posed a minimal ( if any) danger to us. That's it, pure and simple, that's my opinion. That doesn't make me a Liberal or a Democrat, it makes me an individual that thinks we as a nation made a large mistake with our foreign policy. I could care less about all the criticisms of our behavior in the prisons, that's for the military to sort out. I could care less how many schools we build in Iraq, that would mean something if all our schools were up to date. I'm as Conservative as they come if you want to stick to the actual definition of the word. I assure you, when I look over the last 3.5 years, this administration's financial and military policies have been anything but conservative. I'm not even saying John Kerry would make a better President, I'm simply saying I'm very unhappy with the current leadership. I suspect a lot of Republicans and Conservatives feel the same way I do, they just won't admit it in public.",

Yes, I will admit that I'm not pleased with Bush when it comes to some domestic issues. I think his (and Congress's) spending is somewhat out of control and misplaced, I think he could be much tougher with illegals, and I'm sure there are a few more here and there. But he HAS gotten the economy going with the tax cuts and jobs ARE coming back, so overall, I can't complain-no one is perfect. He IS dead on about foreign policy though. I believe he is seeing the future with 20/20 vision, and many AMericans are so fat and happy in their own little world, they don't want to face the very real dangers that we WILL experience in the years to come. Americans who are against this war had better dig deep , we are in for a helluva ride. If they think THIS is tough, just wait.",

   "Jskufan, I can understand where you're coming from. I disagree with you, but at least you're sensible, my hats off to you. There are too many people who go off on anti-Bush/war hysterical rants with no semblance of intelligence.\n \n Skylopps, I agree with you. I don't agree with all of Bush's domestic policies either (actually pretty opposed to what he's done with illegal immigration, living on the US-Mexico border). But I do think that he understands a vital truth, and that is that this country is at war. We have been at war for years, we just didn't know it...that's terrifying to me.\n \n About Bush's foreign policy causing the terrorists to attack us? Not true, according to bin Laden himself. He said in a letter that he bombed American embassies in Africa because they employed women, and that gays were given some recognition in America as human beings. They hate all of us, they hate our society, they hate our people, not just our policies.",
