I have noticed, when debating gun control online, that the victim disarmament crowd shows up wanting to debate. The pro-gunners use facts and logic in support of their argument, and the VD people run away. Usually, it doesn't take long for a new one to show up and go \"AH, but I will cut and paste THIS from the Handgun Control Inc webpage, and that will show them!\".

I know that Rev HellH0und copies and pastes a lot of things from progun websites. It seems to me that we get a lot of pro-gunners here who think they know a lot because they've visited some pro-gun websites. And I wonder what Freud would have said about a group of people who have an obsession with guns. What are they trying to make up for?",
