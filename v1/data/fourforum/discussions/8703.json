   "I recently did read a book by Mbungu a Nini : << the Enigma of the resurrection of Jesus >> (www.kianamaz.com), that shows many current presumptions on the resurrection of Jesus are false. The Bible shows that there are two kinds of resurrection: the coming back to live again physically in this plan of existence, and the resurrection in the beyond. . Jesus referred to the second resurrection when he spoke about the resurrection of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. (Luke 20:37) The one of raises up from the dead in the beyond can only appear to the living. Lazarus was raised from dead by Jesus on this plan of existence, so he wasn't appearing since anyone could go and see him, even the high priests wanted to kill him again. Jesus was appearing after his resurrection that seemed to the same high priests as rumours. Thanks to Mbungu a Nini for this new biblical approach: the resurrection of Jesus happened in the beyond.",
