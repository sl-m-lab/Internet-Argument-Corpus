One of the things I picked up on in his \"Updated\" video was that we're going to have a \"bubble,\" an economic bubble, where people will, for a limited time, think Obama's policies are working. But then Jackson says things will go bad - the bubble won't last. So whoever is funding the stock market at present is going to take it right in the shorts. \n \n Also, his descriptions of the coastal city that gets whacked by a dirty bomb are real interesting. Buildings will be destroyed or burned down. Heck, if they're radioactive, there's not much you can do with them. You can try scrubbing them down but I don't know that that would be practical. It will be interesting to watch. What city would it be? I think Jacksonville would be a likely target, but then so would NY City, Miami, and a number of others.",

   "WHY IS THE STORM COMING? This storm is coming because the Church (the Body of Christ) is no longer the backbone of this nation. From our inception, the Christian faith has been the plumb line of decisions made at all levels of life. The Christian founding of this nation is what makes it different from every other nation, other than perhaps Israel. Other nations may have become Christian in their focus, but none were initially formed with Christianity as the core of its DNA.\n\n \n Is he saying the only way to stop what's coming is a state religion? One may rightly say the US was formed using Christian values, but never were we a Christian theocracy. If he means a call to Christians to follow the teachings of Christ and repent I can agree. Where does the blame lay then? And how in the world is what Obama does going to speed or stop what this prophecy says is coming? So why is the blame in this thread put on him and his cronies? Since 1980-2008 we've had 20 years of conservative rule, and things got worse in spite of that.\n \n In light of this why politicize what's coming when every one of the politicians served to bring this upon us? Abortion was legalized under a conservative president (\"I am not a crook!\"). Gay rights were addressed and given under conservative presidents. Bailouts which led to more bailouts and borderline socialism= conservative president. These issues which the majority of christian conservatives is said to not support. What does liberal utopian paradise have to do with this prophecy when conservatives helped shape it?\n \n Well it's a religious answer isn't it? Christians have failed to accurately serve and witness about Christ. And if we continue to politicize it we diminish the power of the Gospel, fail to repent, fail to reach people at the grass roots level in need of His gospel, fail by that measure to put Godly people in power, and by these failures just sit and let destruction come and expect Jesus to save us.",

And, 2012 is going to be one heck of a nasty year.\n \n p.s.

   "Heavy rain in Florida.....Archie, I'm from your neck of the woods originally and moved to Florida 20 years ago. Yes, 20 inches or rain is unheard of up in your region, but down here that is very common. Being a weather nut, I have my own weather sensors....we had 12 inches of rain in 45 minutes three years ago. 6-10 inches of rain in and hour or two happens at least once a year, sometimes more (and none of these downpours had anything to do with a hurricane, just typical thunderstorms that are either stationary or 'training' over one location). And these downpours are pretty common throughout the bible belt. Weather is pretty boring up in the liberal northeast, hardly any violent weather at all...mostly cool, damp, and drizzly. We in Florida pay a very high price for the incredibly sunny weather we have most of the year. It's one extreme to the other. That's Florida!\n \n Predicting that there will be wars and strife...not a hard prediction since god has encouraged man to over populate the earth which is certain to cause all kinds of fighting over the limited resources...it's like god deliberately created the situation for constant war and strife (if you believe in god...otherwise it's pretty typical of man).\n \n You guys are making yourselves look foolish by posting this stuff.",

What did the dinosaurs do that made god wipe them out (when they weren't even capable of sin). Honestly, I'm not mocking your religion, but even Christians/Muslims/Jews must believe in the randomness of the universe? Why would god even waste his time crashing an asteroid into an empty planet if there is no one there to hurt/punish? Do you believe in the plate tectonic's stuff, or do you honestly believe that god causes all earthquakes? Why is the Bible Belt constantly pelted with hurricanes/tornadoes while the liberal northeast USA has almost none of that? (asking honestly, what's your take on that?) I 'believe' the Bible Belt is pelted like that simply because of it's geographical location, not because they are wicked people deserving punishment, and the Northeast USA is not hit by hurricanes and tornadoes for the same exact reason (not because they love gay people and allow them to marry). emoticon_xangel Adding politics into this definitely proves it's false. And why is the United States the center of all this? Who the heck made the USA the most important thing in the history of man? The USA is not perfect, nor is it even close to perfect. We're just as flawed as any other country. We have our good points and bad points as do all countries. Does god really demand that we all have to be Republicans? Are you honestly saying that?",

   "Separate Prophecy supporting \"The Perfect Storm\"\n \n The Court Of Heaven \n \n Larry Randolph \n Franklin, Tennessee USA \n September 01, 2009\n \n \"Urgent: The Court of Heaven is in Session. It's time for the Church to Get on Their Face - The Verdict is NOT IN YET!\"\n \n Introduction by Larry Randolph\n \n In 2005, I was visited by an Angel of the Lord who showed me a string of events that would unfold beginning in 2007 through the end of 2012. One of the most striking predictions was his proclamation that, \"The economy of this nation will go down a long, dark hill.\" Among many other things, the angel also informed me that in the same year I saw the deaths of many Hollywood celebrities, it would signify the end of an era and the beginning of change in the nation. I shared these things in a few meetings, but felt that I should not yet release the details of the visitation on a national scale.\n \n \"What God Told Me in July of 2008 About THAT September\" \n \n Then in July of 2008, the Lord informed me that a \"perfect storm\" would hit the nation in the middle of September and that it would be the beginning of the economic collapse the angel revealed to me in 2005. Again, I was reluctant to draw national attention to the coming events and purposely restricted the prophetic word to a small number of conferences. Although the prediction came to pass around the 15th of September 2008, part of my reluctance to give the prophetic word was due to much of the negativity that is often associated with a number of prophetic ministries. As one called to encourage the Church prophetically, I tend to shy away from anything that sounds like \"gloom and doom\" and often wait for God to show me the redemptive value of what is happening.\n \n \"I NOW Feel an Urgency to SOUND THE ALARM!\"\n \n That being said, however, I now feel an urgency to sound the alarm that unprecedented events are approaching us on many levels. We are at the end of the \"holding pattern\" we have experienced this year and are about to enter another season of change and great shaking. In fact, there is a \"super-shift\" coming that is truly bittersweet and will ultimately reveal the best of times and the worst of times. In view of the sobering times we are approaching, I have decided to release a prophetic word that I recently delivered at Grace Center, my home church in Franklin, Tennessee. \n \n As you'll hear in the prophecy, the shift begins this September, continuing throughout October, and will gain both momentum and velocity by December 31st. Interestingly, the 31st is a \"blue moon\" night that is an astronomical rarity&#8212;thus the phrase \"once in a blue moon.\"\n \n Also, a part of my decision to release the following prophecy is related to yet another encounter I had in August. Around the middle of the month, I had a vision of a 5.0 earthquake that would mark the beginning of a critical shift. I also saw a greater shaking that was to follow in the near future. The next day, I called my friend Bob Jones who confirmed that he was also feeling \"a trembling\" in the Earth. Several days after our conversation, there was a 5.0 earthquake in Alaska on August 19th, which confirmed to me the importance of the vision. (Reported on Fox News August 19, 2009: 5.0-Magnitude Earthquake Rattles Anchorage, Alaska.)\n \n And, if I am interpreting correctly what I feel and see, there is yet a seven-fold shaking of greater magnitude coming that will produce enormous and perhaps catastrophic disruptions on economic, political, geophysical, atmospheric, and spiritual levels.\n \n No Matter What Events Unfold, God is \"Unfailingly Redemptive\" \n \n However, the good news is that God is unfailingly redemptive, no matter what events unfold in the world. According to the Prophet Isaiah, when darkness invades the Earth, the glory of God is certain to arise upon His people. Although we are entering uncertain and turbulent waters, remember that the challenges we face can affect us for good or for bad. When God shook the fountains of the deep in Noah's day, for example, the flood had both negative and positive implications for that generation. For those outside the ark it was devastating, but for those inside the ark it was liberating. So depending on your posture in Christ, the coming days can either be the best of times or the worst of times.\n \n Larry Randolph \n Larry Randolph Ministries\n Email: info@larryrandolph.com\n \n The following link will take you to a recording of the Live prophecy. The recording takes an hour to listen to. \n \n Untitled\n \n (End Times Prophetic Vision website)",

   "There's numerous examples in scripture, and one could argue from actual history, where when a nation becomes steeped in sin, then the judgment of God falls. First, the blessings of obedience:\n \n Deuteronomy 28\n Blessings for Obedience \n \n 1 If you fully obey the LORD your God and carefully follow all his commands I give you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations on earth. 2 All these blessings will come upon you and accompany you if you obey the LORD your God: \n 3 You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country. \n \n 4 The fruit of your womb will be blessed, and the crops of your land and the young of your livestock-the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks. \n \n 5 Your basket and your kneading trough will be blessed. \n \n 6 You will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out. \n \n 7 The LORD will grant that the enemies who rise up against you will be defeated before you. They will come at you from one direction but flee from you in seven. \n \n 8 The LORD will send a blessing on your barns and on everything you put your hand to. The LORD your God will bless you in the land he is giving you. \n \n 9 The LORD will establish you as his holy people, as he promised you on oath, if you keep the commands of the LORD your God and walk in his ways. 10 Then all the peoples on earth will see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they will fear you. 11 The LORD will grant you abundant prosperity-in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your ground-in the land he swore to your forefathers to give you. \n \n 12 The LORD will open the heavens, the storehouse of his bounty, to send rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. 13 The LORD will make you the head, not the tail. If you pay attention to the commands of the LORD your God that I give you this day and carefully follow them, you will always be at the top, never at the bottom. 14 Do not turn aside from any of the commands I give you today, to the right or to the left, following other gods and serving them.\n \n Next, the Curses for Disobedience: \n \n 15 However, if you do not obey the LORD your God and do not carefully follow all his commands and decrees I am giving you today, all these curses will come upon you and overtake you: \n 16 You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country. \n \n 17 Your basket and your kneading trough will be cursed. \n \n 18 The fruit of your womb will be cursed, and the crops of your land, and the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks. \n \n 19 You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out. \n \n 20 The LORD will send on you curses, confusion and rebuke in everything you put your hand to, until you are destroyed and come to sudden ruin because of the evil you have done in forsaking him. [a] 21 The LORD will plague you with diseases until he has destroyed you from the land you are entering to possess. 22 The LORD will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, with blight and mildew, which will plague you until you perish. 23 The sky over your head will be bronze, the ground beneath you iron. 24 The LORD will turn the rain of your country into dust and powder; it will come down from the skies until you are destroyed. \n \n 25 The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will come at them from one direction but flee from them in seven, and you will become a thing of horror to all the kingdoms on earth. 26 Your carcasses will be food for all the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and there will be no one to frighten them away. 27 The LORD will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, festering sores and the itch, from which you cannot be cured. 28 The LORD will afflict you with madness, blindness and confusion of mind. 29 At midday you will grope about like a blind man in the dark. You will be unsuccessful in everything you do; day after day you will be oppressed and robbed, with no one to rescue you. \n \n 30 You will be pledged to be married to a woman, but another will take her and ravish her. You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even begin to enjoy its fruit. 31 Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of it. Your donkey will be forcibly taken from you and will not be returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and no one will rescue them. 32 Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, and you will wear out your eyes watching for them day after day, powerless to lift a hand. 33 A people that you do not know will eat what your land and labor produce, and you will have nothing but cruel oppression all your days. 34 The sights you see will drive you mad. 35 The LORD will afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that cannot be cured, spreading from the soles of your feet to the top of your head. \n \n 36 The LORD will drive you and the king you set over you to a nation unknown to you or your fathers. There you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone. 37 You will become a thing of horror and an object of scorn and ridicule to all the nations where the LORD will drive you. \n \n 38 You will sow much seed in the field but you will harvest little, because locusts will devour it. 39 You will plant vineyards and cultivate them but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because worms will eat them. 40 You will have olive trees throughout your country but you will not use the oil, because the olives will drop off. 41 You will have sons and daughters but you will not keep them, because they will go into captivity. 42 Swarms of locusts will take over all your trees and the crops of your land. \n \n 43 The alien who lives among you will rise above you higher and higher, but you will sink lower and lower. 44 He will lend to you, but you will not lend to him. He will be the head, but you will be the tail. \n \n  45 All these curses will come upon you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the LORD your God and observe the commands and decrees he gave you. 46 They will be a sign and a wonder to you and your descendants forever. 47 Because you did not serve the LORD your God joyfully and gladly in the time of prosperity, 48 therefore in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and dire poverty, you will serve the enemies the LORD sends against you. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you. \n \n 49 The LORD will bring a nation against you from far away, from the ends of the earth, like an eagle swooping down, a nation whose language you will not understand, 50 a fierce-looking nation without respect for the old or pity for the young. 51 They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine or oil, nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined. 52 They will lay siege to all the cities throughout your land until the high fortified walls in which you trust fall down. They will besiege all the cities throughout the land the LORD your God is giving you. \n \n 53 Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege, you will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters the LORD your God has given you. 54 Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children, 55 and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating. It will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities. 56 The most gentle and sensitive woman among you-so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot-will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter 57 the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears. For she intends to eat them secretly during the siege and in the distress that your enemy will inflict on you in your cities. \n \n 58 If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name-the LORD your God- 59 the LORD will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters, and severe and lingering illnesses. 60 He will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you. 61 The LORD will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed. 62 You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the LORD your God. 63 Just as it pleased the LORD to make you prosper and increase in number, so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. \n \n 64 Then the LORD will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship other gods-gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known. 65 Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the LORD will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart. 66 You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life. 67 In the morning you will say, \"If only it were evening!\" and in the evening, \"If only it were morning!\"-because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see. 68 The LORD will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you. (end of Deut. 28)\n \n One could argue that this only applied to the nation of Israel. But I want to remind you of all the other nations in the Bible, apart from Israel, that came under severe judgment when they got crossways with the Lord. And I want to also remind you of the judgments of God in the book of Revelation and elsewhere that come upon the world in general for it's ungodliness.\n \n When does judgment begin? When the sins of the Amorites (insert name of nation) reaches its full measure (Genesis 15:16).\n \n God is slowly but surely turning up the heat on America. There's not a sin noted in Sodom and Gomorrah that isn't prevalent, and/or even glorified, in the United States of America. \n \n Repent, and come to the Lord. Come out of Sodom. Come out of Gomorrah. Flee from the coming wrath.",

   "A Prophecy From Kim Clement, Memphis, TN \n \n October 25, 2009 \n \n \"For there has been a scheme and a plan against the President of this nation, to suffocate him. God says, The enemy has planned in 2010 to bring shame to the first African President. So that they will say, 'Never again shall an African American be the President of the United States.' This will not happen says the Lord. This will not happen. This will not happen. \n \n There shall come a change in the early part of 2010 and many will say, 'Look things are not quite as bad as what it seemed,' and those who have murmured and those who have spoken evil, those who have spread words out to bring shame to this race will not be satisfied. God says, It has been my desire to raise up a man who would honor me. Yet the people say 'But the policies, what about the policies?' God says, I told you I will change everything in the mid term of this Presidency. However, the enemy has planned an assassination to suffocate his voice. This will not be completed. \n \n God says, This will not be successful. This will not be the desire of the people at the time. There are three groups that have planned this, and the prophet has heard these words. For the one who prophesied this President into existence will not regret the words that God placed into his mouth.\" \n \n \"Three groups are putting this together to bring shame to the USA in 2010, but it shall be, says the Lord, that I will take my angels and I will cause them to hear the prayers of Daniel, Daniel of old, and the prayers of Daniel shall be placed into this time and into this moment. For they shall say, 'What is happening with the prince of Persia? Why is it that there is a battle going on?' God said the spirit of Daniel is praying that this will not take place. I will bring freedom to Persia. I will bring freedom to Persia. I will bring freedom to the Middle East but there will not be a peace treaty. However, the salvation of the Lord shall begin to take place in the Middle East as never before. \n \n God says, Your President shall have a great conversion in 2010 which will bring about changes to this nation and because I have spoken. \n \n \"Your prayers and your praise shall bring about a change in the atmosphere; your praise and your shouts bring about a change, for you don't understand the significance of these sounds. I'm not listening to the journalists or the prognosticators. I'm not listening to CBS or NBC or ABC or FOX. God says, I'm not listening! I'm listening for one sound and one sound only. The prophetic sound that comes from My people as they shout out the victory; for there is a victory that is coming that is greater than ever. A spiritual renewal in 2010 will break the cycle. I will break the cycle. For they have already predicted, 'This President is in line to die in office.' But God says, hear the word of the Lord. I do not see men the way men see men. I see men through my eyes. I know their hearts. I know that the changes you desire politically and economically are not happening. No one can change anything in this Nation but the Lord God Almighty. No one can. A prosperity is about to come upon the Church in such an unusual way.\n \n God says, Athletes are about to arise and penetrate the kingdom of darkness. Economists are about to come forth from young men and young women and the African American people shall rise up and say, 'We have been given the honor and the privilege to go into the marketplace and to build pulpits, and to bring people to Christ,' and so it shall be that I shall put my mantle upon this nation says the spirit of God.\n \n There shall be an exposure; a corruption that has been taking place in the political arena shall be exposed, says the Lord. And they have prayed for this President to lay face down in shame. And they shall say, 'How is it that he (Obama) was the one who brought the truth out and this that took place, this corruption that was taking place, was not revealed by the journalists of this hour but by the President of the United States?'\n \n Why? Because this President sought the Lord, got onto his knees and prayed out for God's blessing upon the nation. \n \n God says, I will honor the prayer in the Easter of 2010. I will break the cycle. For they have predicted another one shall die in office. It shall not be so. For this President shall leave this office, bringing honor to the African American people.\n \n God says, Some will say, 'Now will there ever be another African in the White House?' Yes, there will be another. It shall be an African American woman whom I shall raise up to stand in office and you shall be proud in Memphis, TN, for you celebrated the word of the Lord. \"I've loved to listen to you over the centuries as you have sung. You sang in pain, you sang in bondage and you sing in freedom. They will never take your song away. You sang as slaves, as bondswomen, you sang of freedom. \n \n And that sound has risen to me today again. Certain people of this nation who are enemies of the cross have said, 'We will bring to shame this race.'\n Are you not Americans-Citizens of this Kingdom? \n \n No, you will not be brought to shame. There will not be another unnecessary death. There will not be another unnecessary assassination. For your song and your breath, the fragrance that is upon you has come before me, says the Spirit of the Lord.\"\n \n (Prophecy by Kim Clement)\n The Vault - Prophecy\n \n p.s.

The synagogue was rebuilt a hundred years later and became the most important Jewish house of worship in the Holy Land, only be blown to pieces by Jordanian troops during Israel's 1948 War of Independence. \n \n In 2001, Israel finally decided to rebuild the landmark, which today stands in the center of the Jewish Quarter in Jerusalem's Old City. The building is scheduled to be completed and the Hurva Synagogue dedicated for the third time on March 15 of next year. \n \n Will the Third Temple be built next year?\n \n Jesus talked about the new temple, and the antichrist defiling it. There is room for the new temple on the Temple Mount in Israel. \n \n p.s. The Muslims aren't going to like it one bit.",

We are truly coming out of the \"wilderness of carnal thinking\", allowing God to \"shake the dust of earthliness\" off His people and rending them to become the dominating Kingdom fruit that remains!\n \n I believe I have heard the Lord tell me signs of shaking will occur from 2010 onwards in these strategic areas of the United States:\n \n \u0095 The Central and Midwest USA-earthquakes will occur in the St. Louis, MO surrounding area.

   "An Important Message from Dutch Sheets \n \n It is 5:00 a.m. I have been up all night praying and agonizing over the condition of America. While praying for the nation in general, and also concerning a gathering this summer to cry out for awakening in America, I felt drawn to the book of Joel. While reading it, this word began to stir in me for our nation. I know it is lengthy, but please read it prayerfully. Not since October of 2000 have I been so burdened for America. At that time I issued a call to prayer, which, due to the favor and anointing of the Lord on it, went viral. Millions received it and prayed. My heart cry is that the same thing happens with this word, for I am actually more burdened now than I was then.\n \n America is in a horrendous crisis of monumental proportions, a season much like Israel in the days of Joel. This Old Testament prophet warned of devastating judgment coming to Israel, but laced the warning with hope and God's mercy if certain things occurred. That is precisely where we are in America. We Americans are a confident and optimistic people, which is often good, but can also create a dangerous denial and crippling passivity. This is happening with many. But please do not be deceived by those who are saying everything is fine. The truth is that we, as a nation, are in serious trouble. Listen to these words from Joel-they are accurate for us today:\n \n What a day! Doomsday! God's judgment day has come. The strong God has arrived. This is serious business!...Shake the country up! God's judgment's on its way-the Day's almost here!-Joel 1:15, 2:1 (The Message)\n \n The State of the Nation\n \n If God brought corrective but serious judgment to Israel, we are horribly deceived if we think it will not happen to us. If something doesn't happen to lessen this judgment-and it can be lessened-we are headed for very difficult times. The economy is going to be devastated. The stock market will go well below where it went a few months back-a crash is coming, and soon. More terrorism and violence will occur in our land, perhaps even war. In my spirit I've seen buildings crumbling and cities burning. Devastating natural disasters will take place. In general, hard times will be prevalent. Why is this so? Because we have turned from God and His ways. Consider the true condition of America. This assessment is bleak but accurate.\n \n 1) Our government is in decay. The current leaders of Congress promote homosexuality, abortion and socialism, while arrogantly ignoring God and the wishes of the people. They are proud, power-hungry, self-serving, career politicians, not the statesmen/women we so desperately need. Our President fits the same description. Along with the above, while honoring-in the White House-the Muslim day of prayer, homosexual activists and a coalition of atheists, he refused to honor the time-honored traditions surrounding the National Day of Prayer. And along with Congress and the President, we have many Judges with no regard for God's Word, the Constitution or our true history. The predictable verdict is in: America is in a moral and spiritual crisis of such magnitude that it is almost unbelievable.\n \n 2) What does this look like practically? From my grandparents' day until now, we have gone from 65% of Americans having a biblical worldview to now 4% of today's young people sharing these beliefs. This is staggering! Apart from an absolute miracle, which I believe is still possible, we have lost a generation of Americans to satan and secular humanism. Generally speaking, we are a narcissistic, self-loving nation that has accepted a culture of death, perversion, drugs and violence. We have murdered 51 million babies in the womb, and to satisfy the cry for a toleration of immorality and perversion, we are ready to throw away 6,000 years of honoring God's definition of marriage and family.\n \n More in the link.\n \n The ElijahList - Prophetic Words and Prophecies",

   "The Dream of Dr. Benjamin Rush & God's Hand in Reconciling John Adams and Thomas Jefferson\n \n One of the more bitter aspects of the retirement of John Adams from the presidency in 1800 was the fact that several of those with whom he had early co-labored during the Revolution had became his fervent adversaries. This was especially true in the case of Thomas Jefferson, who, although serving closely with Adams during the Revolution, had became one of his chief enemies during President Washington's administration. This feud not only deeply embittered Adams emotionally but it also troubled Dr. Rush, who was still a close friend of both Adams and Jefferson. In his concern over the relationship between these two, one night several months after Jefferson's retirement from the Presidency in 1809, Dr. Rush had a dream about the two which he felt was important. On October 17, 1809, he wrote down an account of that dream and sent it to John Adams. In describing that dream, he related what he had seen:\n \n \"What book is that in your hands?\" said I to my son Richard [who later became the Secretary of State under President James Monroe] a few nights ago in a dream. \"It is the history of the United States,\" said he. \"Shall I read a page of it to you?\" \"No, no,\" said I. \"I believe in the truth of no history but in that which is contained in the Old and New Testaments.\" \"But, sir,\" said my son, \"this page relates to your friend Mr. Adams.\" \"Let me see it then,\" said I. I read it with great pleasure and herewith send you a copy of it.\n \n \"1809. Among the most extraordinary events of this year was the renewal of the friendship and intercourse between Mr. John Adams and Mr. Jefferson, the two ex-Presidents of the United States. They met for the first time in the Congress of 1775. Their principles of liberty, their ardent attachment to their country ... being exactly the same, they were strongly attracted to each other and became personal as well as political friends.... A difference of opinion upon the objects and issue of the French Revolution separated them during the years in which that great event interested and divided the American people. The predominance of the party which favored the French cause threw Mr. Adams out of the Chair of the United States in the year 1800 and placed Mr. Jefferson there in his stead. The former retired with resignation and dignity to his seat at Quincy, where he spent the evening of his life in literary and philosophical pursuits, surrounded by an amiable family and a few old and affectionate friends. The latter resigned the Chair of the United States in the year 1808, sick of the cares and disgusted with the intrigues of public life, and retired to his seat at Monticello, in Virginia, where he spent the remainder of his days in the cultivation of a large farm agreeably to the new system of husbandry. In the month of November 1809, Mr. Adams addressed a short letter to his friend Mr. Jefferson in which he congratulated him upon his escape to the shades of retirement and domestic happiness, and concluded it with assurances of his regard and good wishes for his welfare. This letter did great honor to Mr. Adams. It discovered a magnanimity known only to great minds. Mr. Jefferson replied to this letter and reciprocated expressions of regard and esteem. These letters were followed by a correspondence of several years in which they mutually reviewed the scenes of business in which they had been engaged, and candidly acknowledged to each other all the errors of opinion and conduct into which they had fallen during the time they filled the same station in the service of their country. Many precious aphorisms [truths], the result of observation, experience, and profound reflection, it is said, are contained in these letters. It is to be hoped the world will be favored with a sight of them. . . . These gentlemen sunk into the grave nearly at the same time, full of years and rich in the gratitude and praises of their country.\" 1\n \n At the time this letter was written, Jefferson and Adams were still vehement opponents. None of what was described in this letter had begun to come to pass, nor did it seem likely that it ever would. Nevertheless, Adams received the dream from his dear friend with an open heart and candidly responded:\n \n My friend, there is something very serious in this business. The Holy Ghost carries on the whole Christian system in this earth. Not a baptism, not a marriage, not a sacrament can be administered but by the Holy Ghost, Who is transmitted from age to age by laying the hands of the Bishop on the heads of candidates for the ministry.... There is no authority, civil or religious - there can be no legitimate government - but what is administered by this Holy Ghost. There can be no salvation without it - all without it is rebellion and perdition, or, in more orthodox words, damnation.... Your prophecy, my dear friend, has not become history as yet. I have no resentment of animosity against the gentleman [Jefferson] and abhor the idea of blackening his character or transmitting him in odious colors to posterity. But I write with difficulty and am afraid of diffusing myself in too many correspondences. If I should receive a letter from him, however, I should not fail to acknowledge and answer it. 2 [To see the entire John Adams to Benjamin Rush letter click here.]\n \n Shortly after this letter, Rush, who was also a dear friend of Jefferson, initiated a correspondence with Jefferson on the same topic, attempting to reconcile the two. Jefferson, too, listened to Rush with an open heart, and tentatively reached out to Adams with a gracious letter. Adams, as he had promised, did \"not fail to acknowledge and answer the letter,\" and thus began a cordial renewing of a warm and sincere friendship between the two.\n \n In retrospect, the amazing accuracy and future fulfillment of several parts of Dr. Rush's dream are absolutely astounding. As accurately described in his dream, Adams and Jefferson did again become close friends, and there did indeed follow the \"correspondence of several years\" described in the dream. Furthermore, the \"world was favored with a sight of the letters\" as entire volumes were eventually published which contained the letters written between those two in their latter years. Interestingly, seventeen years after his dream, they did \"sink into the grave nearly at the same time\" as the two men died within three hours of each other on the same day: July 4th, 1826 - the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence! Finally, both expired \"full of years and rich in the gratitude of praises of their country.\" It would appear that Providence had indeed given this dream to Dr. Rush since, although extremely unlikely at the time, it all eventually came to pass. (For similar Providential involvement in dreams, see Genesis 41:25+ and Daniel 2:28+).\n \n In 1812, some three years after Dr. Rush had related his amazing dream to John Adams, Dr. Rush gratifyingly noted that a reconciliation between the two had begun:\n \n I rejoice in the correspondence which has taken place between you and your old friend, Mr. Jefferson. I consider you and him as the North and South Poles of the American Revolution. Some talked, some wrote, and some fought to promote and establish it, but you and Mr. Jefferson thought for us all. I never take a retrospect of the years 1775 and 1776 without associating your opinions and speeches and conversations with all great political, moral, and intellectual achievements of the Congresses of those memorable years. 3\n Shortly after this letter, Dr. Rush wrote with similar excitement to Jefferson, also expressing to him his pleasure over the rekindled friendship:\n \n In a letter which I received a few days ago from Mr. Adams, he informs me, with a kind of exultation, that after a correspondence of five or six and thirty years had been interrupted by various causes, it had been renewed, and that four letters had passed between you and him. In speaking of your letters, he says, \"They are written with all the elegance, purity, and sweetness of style of his youth and middle age, and with (what I envy more) a firmness of finger and steadiness of chirography [handwriting] that to me are lost forever.\" It will give me pleasure as long as I live to reflect that I [Dr. Rush] have been in any degree instrumental in effecting this reunion of two souls destined to be dear to each other and animated with the same dispositions to serve their country (though in different ways) at the expense of innumerable sacrifices of domestic ease, personal interest, and private friendships. Posterity will do you both justice for this act. If Mr. Adams' letters to you are written in the same elevated and nervous style [at that time, the word \"nervous\" was defined as \"possessing or manifesting vigor of mind; characterized by strength in sentiment or style\"], both as to matter and language, that his letters are which he now and then addresses to me, I am sure you will be delighted with his correspondence. Some of his thoughts electrify me. I view him as a mountain with its head clear and reflecting the beams of the sun, while all below it is frost and snow. 4\n \n On the death of Adams and Jefferson on the very same day, some 17 years after Benjamin Rush has seen that event in his dream, the Rev. Edward Everett (a U. S. Representative & Senator, Governor, Diplomat, Secretary of State, and President of Harvard) delivered an oration in remembrance of the two in which he noted the great impact on America of their dual influence, both before and after their reconciliation:\n \n Having lived and acted and counseled and dared and risked all, and triumphed and enjoyed together, they have gone together to their great reward.... Forgetting the little that had divided them and cherishing the communion of service and peril and success which had united, they walked with honorable friendship the declining pathway of age; and now they have sunk down together in peace into the bosom of a redeemed and grateful country.... They were useful, honored, prosperous, and lovely in their lives, and in their deaths they were not divided. 5\n \n The Dream of Dr. Benjamin Rush & God's Hand in Reconciling John Adams and Thomas Jefferson",

   "And betrayal in the White House\n \n March 25, 2010 - Kim Clement\n \n What I saw this morning may have been a little bit frightening to me but I am now sharing it because I believe each one of you want to know what it is that God has planned. \n \n We are looking at the present administration, political administration of this country and people are saying &#8220;Oh no, things are going to really get worse; God&#8217;s going to judge us because of all this.&#8221;\n \n Just stop thinking Democratic or Liberal or Conservative or Republican; let&#8217;s get our minds out of that just for tonight. Just listen to me, God knows what He&#8217;s doing. For goodness&#8217; sake, stop insulting Him as if He doesn&#8217;t know what the heck he&#8217;s doing.\n \n And there&#8217;s a president in charge; &#8220;we&#8217;re all going to fall to pieces now.&#8221; \n \n God knows what He&#8217;s doing. And even though it may affect us in certain ways economically and socially, He still reigns and His kingdom is in this nation, and that&#8217;s what I want you to know.\n \n This morning I went to my prayer time as always, I took my kids to school and I&#8217;m not traveling through the month of March because God told me to stay. I did that. It was a step of faith for me. But I&#8217;ve been ministering to you through this means of technology. \n \n While I was in prayer, well first of all I took the kids to school, and came back. I went out to the garden to go and pray like I normally do. The first thing I do when I pray is I lift up my hands and I declare His great deeds. You have a choice when you come to God: You can declare His deeds or you can proclaim your needs. I suggest the first thing you do is to proclaim His deeds. And I did that, I said, &#8220;Lord, you are incredible, you are the best thing that&#8217;s ever happened to me&#8221; and I was talking to Him and speaking to Him like I always do and thanking Him for the good things that He&#8217;s done and that He&#8217;s going to do. \n \n I felt Him leading me to go and do some meditation in my time of dedication, and I opened the Bible to read Luke chapter 22 which is what I will teach in a few minutes.\n \n And the Holy Spirit guided me there and before I could read what Luke 22 said, I caught a glimpse in the Spirit. I had a vision, it was, and you know I don&#8217;t say this easily and all of you that know me, you know I don&#8217;t do that. \n \n I had a vision and it was so clear to me, in a second, it just took a few seconds: I saw a long table and it was in the White House, I knew it, and around this table I couldn&#8217;t see faces but I saw a variety of clothing &#8211; Western and Eastern clothing and I didn&#8217;t feel good; I didn&#8217;t feel at peace about it, and I&#8217;m not a fearful person but I was frightened. I was caught up in a moment that is about to happen. And I looked at the Western clothing and the Middle Eastern clothing and I heard a voice saying this, and as he said it I got chills all over me and I became fearful which I don&#8217;t believe is from the Spirit of God. Because I was in the presence of so much evil that I literally went cold as I heard the voice say: &#8220;The hand of the betrayer is on the table. The hand of the betrayer is on the table.&#8221; \n \n And when I heard that I understood a lot of stuff. I&#8217;m a prophet so I get visions; I hear things. \n \n When I was explaining to Joel Osteen&#8217;s mother, Dodie, who&#8217;s a friend of ours, about the future, I was saying &#8220;you know, I see the future, I hear the future, I witness the future, I live the future and I bring it back. Sometimes I don&#8217;t always interpret the future correctly. Sometimes I may misinterpret the future, but that doesn&#8217;t make me a false prophet because everything&#8217;s vague, there&#8217;s never clarity.&#8221; \n \n But this specific vision, there was so much clarity; I knew this was evil happening in the White House. \n \n Now I&#8217;m the one that - I prophesied the first African American President. I prophesied some of the events that took place during the last decade and now I find myself in the same boat.\n \n The betrayer is seated at the table of kings celebrating with one thing in mind: to destroy God&#8217;s people, to destroy God&#8217;s people. I saw these kings sitting together and leaders with one thing in mind &#8211; not all of them: to destroy God&#8217;s people. At that very same table sits the deliverer. You see a betrayer only draws near to the one who holds the key to deliverance. That&#8217;s what happened with Jesus; Jesus held the key; He was the Deliverer. \n \n Now don&#8217;t try and interpret that as &#8220;Oh, so President Obama is the deliverer.&#8221; No, I&#8217;m not saying that. But when you call yourself or you treat yourself as a messiah you will have betrayal. \n \n However, at that same table was a deliverer. So the reason that I saw this betrayal, or that I saw the betrayal, I knew that there was a deliverer at that table; somebody that was going to expose this betrayal. \n \n When I heard these words which I got some clarification later from an email that a dear friend sent me not knowing this and I heard these words: &#8220;Haman was hanged on the very gallows that he had built for Mordecai.&#8221; \n \n Okay, potential dangers, hidden opportunities and victories are being played out in the White House and in palaces both in Iran and Israel alike. I believe the betrayal and the plot is about Israel and the United States of America. The sad thing is that there a lot of people that are falling for it in that group, in that leadership.\n \n I saw a table, a table of leaders and kings discussing matters in the Middle East. In fact it seemed almost like a banqueting table. Their resolutions were made and a plot of the elimination of God&#8217;s people, it was so disguised. \n \n As the plot to destroy God&#8217;s people in Esther&#8217;s day did not succeed, so this plot will not succeed, however, it will be very close. And you that are watching me, you&#8217;ll say, if you didn&#8217;t have this revelation beforehand, you would say &#8220;Oh my God, what is going to happen now?&#8221; Do not fear. God is revealing it before and it will be very close. And our President is blind to it, sorry to tell you, that&#8217;s why it has got so close.\n \n Then I saw something that really also shook me. I saw as a result of this whole thing, I saw ten wars that would take place, little wars. When I say little war, is there such a thing as a little war? But they are short-lived wars but they are very fierce. And I saw these ten battles taking place until the enemies of Israel and the United States had to drop their weapons and give in. But it would take ten fierce battles. And that&#8217;s all I can say, they were such fierce battles, all because of this one moment that I saw. \n \n There is betrayal in the White House. It&#8217;s going to hurt the President. It is going to hurt many, many people that are close to him, but God will rescue.  You see, God&#8217;s desire is always to rescue his people. \n \n More in the link.\n \n The Vault - Prophecy",

   "A Prophecy From Kim Clement, Memphis, TN \n \n October 25, 2009 \n \n \"For there has been a scheme and a plan against the President of this nation, to suffocate him. God says, The enemy has planned in 2010 to bring shame to the first African President. So that they will say, 'Never again shall an African American be the President of the United States.' This will not happen says the Lord. This will not happen. This will not happen. \n \n There shall come a change in the early part of 2010 and many will say, 'Look things are not quite as bad as what it seemed,' and those who have murmured and those who have spoken evil, those who have spread words out to bring shame to this race will not be satisfied. God says, It has been my desire to raise up a man who would honor me. Yet the people say 'But the policies, what about the policies?' God says, I told you I will change everything in the mid term of this Presidency. However, the enemy has planned an assassination to suffocate his voice. This will not be completed. \n \n God says, This will not be successful. This will not be the desire of the people at the time. There are three groups that have planned this, and the prophet has heard these words. For the one who prophesied this President into existence will not regret the words that God placed into his mouth.\" \n \n \"Three groups are putting this together to bring shame to the USA in 2010, but it shall be, says the Lord, that I will take my angels and I will cause them to hear the prayers of Daniel, Daniel of old, and the prayers of Daniel shall be placed into this time and into this moment. For they shall say, 'What is happening with the prince of Persia? Why is it that there is a battle going on?' God said the spirit of Daniel is praying that this will not take place. I will bring freedom to Persia. I will bring freedom to Persia. I will bring freedom to the Middle East but there will not be a peace treaty. However, the salvation of the Lord shall begin to take place in the Middle East as never before. \n \n God says, Your President shall have a great conversion in 2010 which will bring about changes to this nation and because I have spoken. \n \n \"Your prayers and your praise shall bring about a change in the atmosphere; your praise and your shouts bring about a change, for you don't understand the significance of these sounds. I'm not listening to the journalists or the prognosticators. I'm not listening to CBS or NBC or ABC or FOX. God says, I'm not listening! I'm listening for one sound and one sound only. The prophetic sound that comes from My people as they shout out the victory; for there is a victory that is coming that is greater than ever. A spiritual renewal in 2010 will break the cycle. I will break the cycle. For they have already predicted, 'This President is in line to die in office.' But God says, hear the word of the Lord. I do not see men the way men see men. I see men through my eyes. I know their hearts. I know that the changes you desire politically and economically are not happening. No one can change anything in this Nation but the Lord God Almighty. No one can. A prosperity is about to come upon the Church in such an unusual way.\n \n God says, Athletes are about to arise and penetrate the kingdom of darkness. Economists are about to come forth from young men and young women and the African American people shall rise up and say, 'We have been given the honor and the privilege to go into the marketplace and to build pulpits, and to bring people to Christ,' and so it shall be that I shall put my mantle upon this nation says the spirit of God.\n \n There shall be an exposure; a corruption that has been taking place in the political arena shall be exposed, says the Lord. And they have prayed for this President to lay face down in shame. And they shall say, 'How is it that he (Obama) was the one who brought the truth out and this that took place, this corruption that was taking place, was not revealed by the journalists of this hour but by the President of the United States?'\n \n Why? Because this President sought the Lord, got onto his knees and prayed out for God's blessing upon the nation. \n \n God says, I will honor the prayer in the Easter of 2010. I will break the cycle. For they have predicted another one shall die in office. It shall not be so. For this President shall leave this office, bringing honor to the African American people.\n \n God says, Some will say, 'Now will there ever be another African in the White House?' Yes, there will be another. It shall be an African American woman whom I shall raise up to stand in office and you shall be proud in Memphis, TN, for you celebrated the word of the Lord. \"I've loved to listen to you over the centuries as you have sung. You sang in pain, you sang in bondage and you sing in freedom. They will never take your song away. You sang as slaves, as bondswomen, you sang of freedom. \n \n And that sound has risen to me today again. Certain people of this nation who are enemies of the cross have said, 'We will bring to shame this race.'\n Are you not Americans-Citizens of this Kingdom? \n \n No, you will not be brought to shame. There will not be another unnecessary death. There will not be another unnecessary assassination. For your song and your breath, the fragrance that is upon you has come before me, says the Spirit of the Lord.\"\n \n (Prophecy by Kim Clement)\n The Vault - Prophecy\n \n p.s.

   "The facts are that teams of some of the brightest and most capable Greek scholars of the 20th and 21st century have reviewed the earliest manuscripts of the New Testament for various Bible translations, and after all that, not one critical, foundational Biblical \"truth\" has been rejected. Time and time again, we find the same truths after these exhaustive investigations, reviews, and publications: Christ was born in Bethlehem, he preached his Gospel, he performed miracles, he was crucified, died, and was resurrected, and ascended into the clouds of heaven.\n\n \n Here is you challenge. Don't give me any of your smoke and mirror shell game diversions, just stick to credible facts.\n \n How old is the earliest Greek MSS used to compare later translations?\n (try and keep it to something usable. Not a fragment with two words or a sentence.)\n \n How do those scholars determine that those early Greek MSS are reliable and accurate?\n \n What source do they use to translate the ancient Greek?\n \n When is that source from?\n \n What does history show happens when a Bible is published that differs in it's interpretation of what traditionally is believed? \n \n \nYou've been called out previously to show us where any of the Gospel accounts of the resurrection have been substantially altered or invented, and all you could do is blow hot air back and suck your thumb. You had nothing.\n\n \n You have had no response to the added ending of Mark\n \n You have had no response to the Gospels having inconsistant stories describing what day Jesus was crucified. Sorry you did respond by giving the calendar date, which according to John is wrong, but you were ok with Mt and Mk and Lk was specific enough to say. The question was what day of the week and why do the 4 Gospels not support each other on that day.\n \n The geneaology of Jesus\n \n Not observing the Sabbath\n \n Not observing dietary laws\n \n \nAnd you have nothing now. If you did you should publish it and shove it down the throats of the Biblical community. But instead, you sit here in this forum and expectorate a daily load of horse manure about how the New Testament cannot be trusted. You've got nothing of substance that in any way changes these historical truths of the New Testament, and you know it. Whether you will admit it is another issue.\n\n \n \n Answer the above and don't just ignore it to come back later and make the same BS claims over and over again\n \n \nNot only that, but you brought your own \"expert\" (N.T. Wright) that you crowed about into the fray to support one of your arguments, and even he supports the resurrection. You even listed his degrees and scholarly achievements, and even he doesn't buy into your anti-resurrection madness. You're a joke.\n \n And those are the facts.\n\n \n No they aren't. As usual you can't defend your position by being honest. You have to resort to deception and misdirection in hopes you can \"sneak\" something by. You cherry pick and twist the meanings and context of whatever you can in order to prove your point. That isn't real no matter how many times you try and pass it off as legitimate it never will be.\n \n \n \nSo, you and fellow antichrists (1 John 2:22) either publish your work or go suck down some more Kool Aid.

The \"Word\" in John 1 is the Logos.\n \n By starting out his gospel stating, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,\" John is introducing Jesus with a word or a term that both his Jewish and Gentile readers would have been familiar with. The Greek word translated \"Word\" in this passage is Logos, and it was common in both Greek philosophy and Jewish thought of that day. For example, in the Old Testament the \"word\" of God is often personified as an instrument for the execution of God's will (Psalm 33:6; 107:20; 119:89; 147:15-18). So, for his Jewish readers, by introducing Jesus as the \"Word,\" John is in a sense pointing them back to the Old Testament where the Logos or \"Word\" of God is associated with the personification of God's revelation. And in Greek philosophy, the term Logos was used to describe the intermediate agency by which God created material things and communicated with them. In the Greek worldview, the Logos was thought of as a bridge between the transcendent God and the material universe. Therefore, for his Greek readers the use of the term Logos would have likely brought forth the idea of a mediating principle between God and the world.\n \n So, essentially, what John is doing by introducing Jesus as the Logos is drawing upon a familiar word and concept that both Jews and Gentiles of his day would have been familiar with and using that as the starting point from which He introduces them to Jesus Christ. But John goes beyond the familiar concept of Logos that his Jewish and Gentile readers would have had and presents Jesus Christ not as a mere mediating principle like the Greeks perceived, but as a personal being, fully divine, yet fully human. Also, Christ was not simply a personification of God's revelation as the Jews thought, but was indeed God's perfect revelation of Himself in the flesh, so much so that John would record Jesus' own words to Philip: \"Jesus said unto Him, 'Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how do you say, \"Show us the Father\"?'\" (John 14:9). By using the term Logos or \"Word\" in John 1:1, John is amplifying and applying a concept that was familiar with his audience and using that to introduce his readers to the true Logos of God in Jesus Christ, the Living Word of God, fully God and yet fully man, who came to reveal God to man and redeem all who believe in Him from their sin.\n \n What do John 1:1,14 mean when they declare that Jesus is the Word of God?",

Originally a word meaning \"word,\" \"account,\" or \"reason,\"[1] it became a technical term in philosophy, beginning with Heraclitus (ca. 535-475 BC), who used the term for the principle of order and knowledge in the Universe.[2]\n \n The sophists used the term to mean discourse, and Aristotle applied the term to rational discourse. The Stoic philosophers identified the term with the divine animating principle pervading the Universe. After Judaism came under Hellenistic influence, Philo (ca. 20 BC-40 AD) adopted the term into Jewish philosophy.[3] The Gospel of John identifies the Logos, through which all things are made, as divine (theos),[4] and further identifies Jesus as the incarnation of the Logos.\n \n In current use, Logos may refer to any of these senses. Outside academic discussions, the Christian sense, identifying Jesus with the Word of God, is perhaps the most common use.\n \n Logos - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Due to Stoicism being founded in the culture of ancient Greece, and in the context of ancient Greek religion, and historically prior to Christianity, Stoicism was naturally regarded by the Fathers of the Church as a 'pagan philosophy'.[4][5] Nonetheless, some of the central philosophical concepts of Stoicism were employed by the early Christian writers. Examples include the terms \"logos\", \"virtue\", \"Spirit\", and \"conscience\".[29] But the parallels go well beyond the sharing (or borrowing) of terminology. Both Stoicism and Christianity assert an inner freedom in the face of the external world, a belief in human kinship with Nature (or God), and a sense of the innate depravity-or \"persistent evil\"-of humankind.[29] Both encourage askesis with respect to the passions and inferior emotions (viz. lust, envy and anger) so that the higher possibilities of one's humanity can be awakened and developed. The major difference between the two philosophies is Stoicism's pantheism where God is never fully transcendent but always immanent. God as the world-creating entity is personalised in Christian thought but Stoicism equates God with the totality of the universe. Also, Stoicism, unlike Christianity, posits no beginning or end to the universe, and no continued individual existence beyond death.[29] Even so, Stoic writings such as the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius have been highly regarded throughout the centuries. St. Ambrose of Milan was known for applying Stoic philosophy to his theology.\n \n \n \n Logos meaning Jesus is a result of Christianity which borrowed it from Greek philosophy which in turn borrowed and so and so on.\n \n Where John was supposed to have written this Gospel was a large Hellenistic city. The influence of which is apparent throughout the Gospel.\n \n Not bad for an illiterate fisherman who had been martyred before he wrote the Gospel bearing his name. Maybe it was a fish that instructed him in Greek philosophy.",

In Acts of Apostles of the Greek Testament, Chapter 13th and verse 1, the word Niger (i.e., black man) in the name Simeon the Negro is a Roman or Latin word (niger, nigra, nigrum) meaning black.

   "2010: The Beginning of the Perfect Storm\n \n Still another prophet brings up the same subject as the OP.\n \n At the beginning of 2010, my first of the year message was on \"Responding to Storms.\" I have addressed this theme in my weekly email communications earlier in the year, but I felt led to bring this to your attention once again. When I gave this message, I knew I was speaking to my very city, prophetically, as well as wisdom needed for our nation and the nations. I shared on this theme everywhere I went for the entire month of January. \n \n Several established prophets are declaring that the \"Perfect Storm\" is coming or even upon us. Locally, the historic 1,000-year flood hit Nashville in May. We have watched the Greece economic meltdown; we are still in the midst of the Gulf Oil Spill catastrophe; the Iraq and Afghanistan wars still go on with no real resolution in sight; and turmoil is mounting in many nations. \n \n In 1987, the Lord showed me part of what would take place in the year 2010, and I remember it all so well. The Holy Spirit spoke to me in the night seasons that the world would begin to unravel in 2010, and it would be a hinge in world history where things would never return to what we have considered normal. In 1987 the Holy Spirit showed me that 2010 would be the beginning of the TIME OF GREAT STORMS. It is upon us!\n \n A Worldwide Shaking and Awakening \n \n I believe it is the best of times and for those without faith-it is the worst of times. The glory and the shaking come together. It is true on both sides of the coin. We are crossing the threshold into the Third Great Awakening and yet we are crossing the threshold into a great Worldwide Shaking. \n \n The ElijahList - Prophetic Words and Prophecies",

Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. 4For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. 6This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. 7Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.\n \n \n 1Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good, 2to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and to show true humility toward all men. \n \n \n 13Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, 14or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.\n \n Have you prayed for Obama as instructed by the Bible?\n \n 1I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone- 2for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. 3This is good, and pleases God our Savior, 4who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.",

Through his teaching you will connect the dots and be shocked at the mysteries he unfolds from the books of Daniel and Revelation. Find out who the Anti-Christ could truly be and what role Islam will play in the Tribulation. \n \n See the interview at the website below:\n \n Sid Roth - It's Supernatural Messianic Vision: Joel Richardson 2010\n \n Richardson identifies the Islamist (Adnan Oktar) who is now pushing for a Third Jewish Temple to be built alongside the Dome of the Rock. An end-time Jewish Temple would fulfill Biblical prophecy. He explains why Jimmy Carter is antisemitic, and tells about the money Bush, Clinton, Obama and Harvard and Georgetown have received from Saudi Arabia. That's why the Ivy League schools are anti-semitic. He explains who the Beast of Revelation is. Richardson says Turkey will soon emerge as the head of Islamic influence.\n \n Adnan Oktar - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

That's because with a warmer climate, there's more moisture in the air, which makes storms including blizzards, more intense, he said.\n \n White House science adviser John Holdren said we should get used to climate disasters or do something about global warming: \"The science is clear that we can expect more and more of these kinds of damaging events unless and until society's emissions of heat-trapping gases and particles are sharply reduced.\"[/B]\n\n \n But at least they are right about one thing. The End of the World will not be brought upon us by GOD or JEBUS, it will be US destroying ourselves. \n \n LMAO.. what a Doofus.....",

That makes for a non-convincing prophecy. \n \n\n \n The fallacy of what you're saying is that if there is a legitimite prophecy, then it will ALWAYS BE SOMETHING FIXED BY MAN TO MAKE IT HAPPEN, in your opinion.\n \n Let's look at one that couldn't have been fixed:\n \n THE SUN DARKENED AT NOON\n \n Circa 750 B.C.\n \n According to Amos 1:1, Amos prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (767-739 B.C.), and Jeroboam, king of Israel (782-753 B.C.). The name \"Amos\" is derived from the Hebrew term meaning, \"lift a burden,\" or \"burden-bearer\" (note Isaiah 9:4, speaking of the coming Messiah as one who would carry our burdens, and also Matthew 11:28). His calling by God was to foretell of pending judgments upon a number of surrounding nations, and particularly of a coming judgment upon Israel. As is common with other Biblical prophets, along with the promise of impending judgment, God also gave Amos a glimpse of events that would soon occur in the life of the coming Messiah, though the significance of what was prophesied may or may not have been made known to Amos. And so it is in the Old Testament book of Amos that we find a prophecy that for many centuries was looked upon with wonder and curiosity:\n \n \"'In that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord, 'I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight....I will make that time like mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.'\" (Amos 8:9-10)\n \n It probably wasn't until the day of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 32 A.D. that the prophecy of Amos took on clarity and meaning, for in Matthew 27:45 Jesus had just been nailed to the cross when the Bible records:\n \n \"From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.\"\n \n Just as the \"Star of Bethlehem\" marked the birth of Christ, so now God brought forth another celestial miracle to pronounce His death. This prophecy is one of those that is beyond the control of mortal man, and as such it dispels the theory that Christ could have manipulated events so as to make it appear that He was the Messiah.

   "The fallacy of what you're saying is that if there is a legitimite prophecy, then it will ALWAYS BE SOMETHING FIXED BY MAN TO MAKE IT HAPPEN, in your opinion.\n \n Let's look at one that couldn't have been fixed:\n \n THE SUN DARKENED AT NOON\n \n Circa 750 B.C.\n \n According to Amos 1:1, Amos prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (767-739 B.C.), and Jeroboam, king of Israel (782-753 B.C.). The name \"Amos\" is derived from the Hebrew term meaning, \"lift a burden,\" or \"burden-bearer\" (note Isaiah 9:4, speaking of the coming Messiah as one who would carry our burdens, and also Matthew 11:28). His calling by God was to foretell of pending judgments upon a number of surrounding nations, and particularly of a coming judgment upon Israel. As is common with other Biblical prophets, along with the promise of impending judgment, God also gave Amos a glimpse of events that would soon occur in the life of the coming Messiah, though the significance of what was prophesied may or may not have been made known to Amos. And so it is in the Old Testament book of Amos that we find a prophecy that for many centuries was looked upon with wonder and curiosity:\n \n \"'In that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord, 'I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight....I will make that time like mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.'\" (Amos 8:9-10)\n \n It probably wasn't until the day of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 32 A.D. that the prophecy of Amos took on clarity and meaning, for in Matthew 27:45 Jesus had just been nailed to the cross when the Bible records:\n \n \"From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.\"\n \n Just as the \"Star of Bethlehem\" marked the birth of Christ, so now God brought forth another celestial miracle to pronounce His death.

   "The fallacy of what you're saying is that if there is a legitimite prophecy, then it will ALWAYS BE SOMETHING FIXED BY MAN TO MAKE IT HAPPEN, in your opinion.\n \n Let's look at one that couldn't have been fixed:\n\n \n First of all, that 'prophecy' is extremely vague and in no way is clearly talking about Jesus or the crucifixion. The only thing that really would even make you think that would be Amos 8:10... \n \n \nI will turn your religious feasts into mourning and all your singing into weeping. I will make all of you wear sackcloth and shave your heads. I will make that time like mourning for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day.\n\n \n It doesn't specifically mention that a son will die, it is saying that the days of the feasts will be 'like mourning for an only son.' Like just about every prophecy, it is extremely vague and means nothing until the people who believe in it find an event to fit. \n \n Not to mention the who darkening of the day thing during the time of the crucifix is hardly accepted as fact due to a lack of mention in secular writings at the time. This is from wikipedia:\n \n \nVarious writers have said that the account in the synoptic gospels is mythical. During the nineteenth century, Kersey Graves argued the biblical account was \"too incredible and too ludicrous to merit serious notice.\"[22] His arguments stemmed from Gibbon's comments on the silence of Seneca and Pliny about the crucifixion darkness. Burton Mack suggests the story was an invention originated by the author of the Gospel of Mark.[23]\n \n The unusually long length of time the eclipse is supposed to have lasted has been used as an argument against its historicity, as has the lack of mention of the darkness in secular accounts and the Gospel of John.[24] One view is that the account in the synoptic gospels is a literary creation of the gospel writers, intended to heighten the sense of importance of a theologically significant event by taking a recent remembered event and applying it to the story of Jesus, just as eclipses were associated in accounts of other historical figures:\n \n \"It is probable that, without any factual basis, darkness was added in order to wrap the cross in a rich symbol and/or assimilate Jesus to other worthies\".[25]\n \n In the Gospel of Mark, the miraculous darkness accompanies the temple curtain being torn in two.[26] Some scholars question the historicity of the darkness in the Gospel of Mark and suggest that it may have been a literary creation intended to add drama.[26][27] To Mark's account, Matthew adds an earthquake and the resurrection of saints.[28] Modern seismologists have studied the earthquake that rocked Nicaea and other cities throughout Bythenia.[16] The Gospel of Luke and the Seven Books of History Against the Pagans by Orosius refer specifically to the darkening of the sun.[29][30]:150 The Gospel of John does not report any wondrous miracles associated with Jesus' crucifixion.\n \n In pious traditions of the Eastern Churches a recounting of this miraculous eclipse has long been a standard of Holy Friday observances as both an historical reference and for practical purposes, chiefly to satisfy the \"three day dilemma\" considered to be a poignant nuisance since the earliest days of Christianity. In ancient Greece and Palestine as in many other ancient societies the day was considered to begin with sunset. This however means that, if as traditionally held, if Jesus was crucified on Friday afternoon and arose from the dead on the morning of the following Sunday, by the reckoning of Jesus' contemporaries there would have been a total of only two days between the crucifixion and the resurrection. The eclipse purportedly resolves this dilemma, in that the crucifixion eclipse was darkness followed by light, constituting one \"night/day\" in the hours before the setting of the sun.\n\n \n Crucifixion darkness and eclipse - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Your whole \"but it couldn't have been an eclipse since it was a full moon at the time of the crucifixion\" is also irrelevant. It's entirely possible that the gospel writers had witnessed an eclipse before, and just inserted into the gospel to make it more dramatic.",

In his book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict (Volume 1, pages 81-87), Josh McDowell provides the following historical evidence that what took place at Calvary was more that just fanciful mythology:\n \n Concerning the Samaritan-born historian Thallus, circa 52 A.D: (The writings of Thallus no longer exist, yet were alluded to by the historian Julius Africanus, as follows): \"Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me - unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of a full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died.\"\n \n Likewise, Africanus wrote concerning the writings of another first century historian by the name of Phlegon: \"....during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon.\" \n \n Phlegon is also mentioned by the historian Origen in his work, \"Contra Celsum,\" book 2, sections 14, 39, and 59: \"Phlegon mentioned the eclipse that took place during the crucifixion of the Lord Christ....and this is shown by the historical account itself of Tiberius Caesar.\" Apparently at one time there were historical accounts of the strange darkness that came over the land that were kept in the official archives of Tiberius Caesar, though they are likely lost to history.\n \n Finally, the 2nd century Roman born jurist and theologian Tertullian referred to a Roman archives report of an \"unexplained darkness that took place during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, as can be seen in the archives of Pontius Pilate.\"\n \n The darkness spoken of in the book of Matthew occurred between noon and three P.M. in the afternoon (from the sixth to the ninth hours, as the Jews were noted as referring to the sixth and the ninth hours of daylight). Note that a solar eclipse will take less than an hour to complete, and a total solar eclipse lasts just a few minutes. This, coupled with the fact that a solar eclipse cannot occur during a full moon (the moon would be on the 'other' side of the earth), provides further evidence that what occurred was something other than an eclipse of the sun. Just what it was no one can say for sure, just that from recorded historical sources there was a strange darkness during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. From God's perspective, it surely was a time of mourning for His only begotten son. \n \n Jesus once said, \"I am the light of the world.\" So it shouldn't be surprising that during his death there might be a time of darkness over the land. \n \n Jesus is Lord!\n\n \n How many times have you been busted with this, but yet your still bring it out when you think nobody is looking. besides it all being hearsay it makes an interesting claim. Why was God in mourning over a lost son? Wasn't this his plan? The only possible way to reconcile himself with his creation? Does not Jesus return to him in Heaven? This should have been a reason to celebrate on Earth and in Heaven, but no it is a time of mourning, Judas is considered the betrayer, the Jews condemned for \"murdering\" the Christ. Yet God knew, Jesus knew and The Apostles knew but oddly they had no faith in Jesus, they said they knew him as the son of God but not one of them believed in him. \n \n And you expect us who are separated by 2000 years to accept what the Apostles would not who walked and talked with Jesus for years.",

   "End of Days in May? Christian group spreads word\n \n By TOM BREEN, Associated Press Tom Breen, Associated Press &#8211; Mon Jan 3, 10:01 am ET\n \n RALEIGH, N.C. &#8211; If there had been time, Marie Exley would have liked to start a family. Instead, the 32-year-old Army veteran has less than six months left, which she'll spend spreading a stark warning: Judgment Day is almost here.\n \n Exley is part of a movement of Christians loosely organized by radio broadcasts and websites, independent of churches and convinced by their reading of the Bible that the end of the world will begin May 21, 2011.\n\n End of Days in May? Christian group spreads word - Yahoo! News\n \n I especially loved this part:\n \n \nCamping, 89, believes the Bible essentially functions as a cosmic calendar explaining exactly when various prophecies will be fulfilled.\n \n The retired civil engineer said all his calculations come from close readings of the Bible, but that external events like the foundation of the state of Israel in 1948 are signs confirming the date.\n \n \"Beyond the shadow of a doubt, May 21 will be the date of the Rapture and the day of judgment,\" he said.\n \n The doctrine known as the Rapture teaches that believers will be taken up to heaven, while everyone else will remain on earth for a period of torment, concluding with the end of time. Camping believes that will happen in October.\n\n \n ...and this has to be the best statement of all:\n \n \n\"If May 21 passes and I'm still here, that means I wasn't saved. Does that mean God's word is inaccurate or untrue? Not at all,\" Warden said.\n\n \n I get the feeling that a lot of people are not going to be \"saved\" on May 21. \n \n I think that when May 21 comes and goes without event...we should be able to lock all of these people in padded rooms and treat them with electroconvulsive therapy.\n \n (an aside: I started laughing out loud while reading this story...and my wife asked me what I was laughing about. I told her that some group of nutjobs were running around saying that the world was going to end on May 21st. She looked at me and without batting an eyelid immediately said \"I wonder if I work that day?\" That was the funniest thing I heard today.)",

Take a look:\n \n \n Temporal lobe epilepsy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n Temporal lobe epilepsy a.k.a. Psychomotor epilepsy, is a form of focal epilepsy, a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures. Over 40 types of epilepsies are known.[1] They fall into two main categories: partial-onset (focal or localization-related) epilepsies and generalized-onset epilepsies. Partial-onset epilepsies account for about 60% of all adult epilepsy cases, and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common single form causing refractory epilepsy.[2]\n \n Temporal lobe epilepsies are a group of medical disorders in which humans and animals experience recurrent epileptic seizures arising from one or both temporal lobes of the brain. Two main types are internationally recognized according to the International League Against Epilepsy.[1]\n \n * Medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) arises in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala which are located in the inner aspect of the temporal lobe.\n * Lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE) arises in the neocortex on the outer surface of the temporal lobe of the brain.\n \n Because of strong interconnections, seizures beginning in either the medial or lateral temporal areas often spread to involve both areas and also to neighboring areas on the same side of the brain as well as the temporal lobe on the opposite side of the brain. The causes or etiology of different temporal lobe epilepsies vary and are discussed below.\n \n \n Syndrome of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE)\n \n The classical syndrome of TLE may begin when there is a very early insult to the left or right hippocampus that causes neuron death. Infants may develop lung or skin infections resulting in a fever. Babies have an immature thermoregulation system, and the fever causes the baby's core body temperature to increase more drastically than in adults.[citation needed] In some children, elevated body temperature can cause febrile seizures.[citation needed] Febrile seizures are relatively normal as they occur in 2-5% of children under age 5 years.[citation needed] They typically last only a few minutes or even a matter of seconds, but are neither severe motor convulsions nor followed by weakness on one side of the body. In a small number of babies, these convulsions can last for over an hour and involve repeated convulsive episodes. These are known as complex febrile seizures and may be causatively associated with TLE.[citation needed] As discussed below in the section on causes, it remains controversial whether complex febrile seizures actually cause TLE,[citation needed] or whether they are simply the earliest manifestation of the TLE condition.[citation needed]\n [edit] Causes\n \n A link between febrile seizures (seizures coinciding with episodes of fever in young children) and subsequent temporal lobe epilepsy has been suggested, but the exact role remains unclear.[3][4][5][6][7] Some studies have shown abnormalities of the hippocampus on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in status epilepticus, which supports the theory that prolonged seizures damage the brain.[8][9][10] Interestingly, some cases of MTLE present without the typical changes of mesial temporal sclerosis or other abnormalities on MRI scans. This has been termed paradoxical mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The epilepsy in these patients tends to occur at a later age, which might suggest that an early event leads to hippocampal damage causing MTLE.[11][12] Although this theory needs confirmation, some studies have pointed to human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) as a possible link between febrile convulsions and later MTLE. Firstly, several studies suggest that HHV-6 infection occurs commonly prior to the occurrence of febrile seizures.[13][14][15][16] However, only a minority of primary HHV-6 infections may be associated with febrile seizures.[17] Secondly, other studies found HHV-6 DNA in brain tissue removed during surgery for MTLE.[18][19][20][21]\n \n Rarely, MTLE can be hereditary or related to brain tumors, spinal meningitis, encephalitis, head injury or blood vessel malformations. MTLE can occur in association with other brain malformations. Most often, a cause cannot be determined with certainty.\n \n LTLE is less common. It can be hereditary, as in Autosomal Dominant Lateral Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (ADLTLE) with auditory or visual features, but can also be associated with tumors, meningitis, encephalitis, trauma, vascular malformations or congenital brain malformations. Again, in many affected persons it is common that no cause can be identified.\n \n Dispersion of granule cell layer in the hippocampal dentate gyrus is occasionally seen in temporal lobe epilepsy and has been linked to the downregulation of reelin,[22][23] a protein that normally keeps the layer compact by containing the neuronal migration. It is unknown whether changes in reelin expression play a role in epilepsy.\n [edit] Symptoms\n \n The symptoms felt by the person, and the signs observable by others, during seizures which begin in the temporal lobe depend upon the specific regions of the temporal lobe and neighboring brain areas affected by the seizure. The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures published in 1981 by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) recognizes three types of seizures which persons with TLE may experience.[24]\n \n 1. Simple Partial Seizures (SPS) involve small areas of the temporal lobe such as the amygdala or the hippocampus. The term \"simple\" means that consciousness is not altered. In temporal lobe epilepsy SPS usually only cause sensations. These sensations may be mnestic such as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (a feeling of familiarity), jamais vu (a feeling of unfamiliarity), a specific single or set of memories, or amnesia. The sensations may be auditory such as a sound or tune, gustatory such as a taste, or olfactory such as a smell that is not physically present. Sensations can also be visual, involve feelings on the skin or in the internal organs. The latter feelings may seem to move over the body. Psychic sensations can occur such as an out-of-body feeling. Dysphoric or euphoric feelings, fear, anger, and other sensations can also occur during SPS. Often, it is hard for persons with SPS of TLE to describe the feeling. SPS are often called \"auras\" by lay persons who mistake them for a warning sign of a subsequent seizure. In fact, they are indeed seizures. Persons experiencing only SPS may not recognize what they are or seek medical advice about them. SPS may or may not progress to the seizure types listed below.\n 2. Complex Partial Seizures (CPS) by definition are seizures which impair consciousness to some extent. This is to say that they alter the person's ability to interact with his or her environment. They usually begin with an SPS, but then the seizure spreads to a larger portion of the temporal lobe resulting in impaired consciousness. Signs may include motionless staring, automatic movements of the hands or mouth, altered ability to respond to others, unusual speech, or unusual behaviors.\n 3. Seizures which begin in the temporal lobe but then spread to the whole brain are known as Secondarily Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (SGTCS). These begin with an SPS or CPS phase initially, but then the arms, trunk and legs stiffen (tonic) in either a flexed or extended position and then clonic jerking of the limbs often occurs. GTCS are often known in the vernacular as convulsions or \"grand mal\" (cf. French, grand maladie) seizures.\n \n Following each of these seizures, there is some period of recovery in which neurological function is altered. This is called the postictal state. The degree and length of the impairment directly correlates with the severity of the 3 seizure types listed above. SPS often last less than 60 seconds, CPS often last less than 2 minutes, and SGTCS usually last less than 3 minutes. The postictal state in the case of CPS and GTCS often lasts much longer than the seizure ictus itself. Because a major function of the temporal lobe is short-term memory, CPS and GTCS cause amnesia for the seizure. As a result, many persons with temporal lobe CPS and GTCS will not remember having had a seizure.\n \n Local and national laws exist regarding the operation of vehicles, aircraft and vessels by patients with epilepsy. Most licensing departments do not allow driving of vehicles by persons with CPS or GTCS until they have been seizure-free for a specified period of time. The laws are complex and varied; affected persons must check with the appropriate licensing authority. In a few locations, health care providers are legally-required to report patients with epilepsy (and other medical conditions which cause episodes of altered consciousness) to their local department of motor vehicles.[25]\n [edit] Treatments\n \n There are many oral medications available for the management of epileptic seizures. They were previously called anticonvulsants but this term is misleading owing to the fact that most seizures are not convulsions. The modern term is antiepileptic drugs or AEDs, for short. In TLE, the most commonly used older AEDs are phenytoin, carbamazepine, primidone, valproate and phenobarbital. Newer drugs, such as gabapentin, topiramate, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, pregabalin, tiagabine, lacosamide, and zonisamide promise similar effectiveness, possibly with fewer side-effects. Felbamate and vigabatrin are newer AEDs, but can have serious adverse effects so they are not considered first-line AEDs. Nearly all AEDs function by decreasing the excitation of neurons (e.g., by blocking fast or slow sodium channels or modulating calcium channels) or by enhancing the inhibition of neurons (e.g., by potentiating the effects of inhibitory neurotransmitters like GABA). Unfortunately, many patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (up to one-third) will not experience adequate seizure control with medication.[26]\n \n For patients with mesial TLE whose seizures remain uncontrolled after trials of several AEDs (intractable), resective surgery should be considered.[27] Epilepsy surgery has been performed since the 1860s and physicians and surgeons had observed for decades that it was highly effective in producing seizure freedom. However, it was not until 2001 that a scientifically sound study was performed on the effectiveness of temporal lobectomy.[28] This study proved that after the failure of several AEDs to control seizures in TLE temporal lobe surgery is far more effective in producing seizure freedom than is additional medication trials. The unanswered question that remains is how many medications must a person fail before considering surgery. A United States sponsored research study called ERSET was begun to answer the question of whether surgery can successfully be performed early in the course of TLE. Although the study ended earlier than anticipated, limited results are expected soon.[citation needed]\n \n In preparation for these surgeries, patients are monitored by various methods to determine the focus of their seizures (that is, the region of the brain where seizures tend to arise before spreading). This can be done with video-EEG monitoring, intracranial EEG (where electrodes are placed beneath the skull, either within or resting just outside the brain), or SPECT imaging. MRI studies may additionally be used to seek evidence of hippocampal sclerosis. Once the epileptic focus has been determined, it can be excised, which usually involves removing part of the hippocampus and often the amygdala. To avoid removing areas of the brain responsible for speech (so-called \"eloquent\" areas), the surgical team will conduct a Wada test pre-operatively, wherein amobarbital is injected in the left or right carotid artery to temporarily quiet one half of the brain. If the patient performs poorly on neuropsychological testing during the intracarotid amobarbital (Wada) test, the surgical team may advise the patient against surgery or may offer a more limited operation.\n \n If a person is not an optimal candidate for epilepsy surgery, then AEDs not previously tried, the vagus nerve stimulator, or AEDs in clinical research trials might be alternative treatments.[citation needed]For children, the ketogenic diet may also be tried.[citation needed]Other possible future therapies such as brain cortex responsive neural stimulators, deep brain stimulation, and stereotactic radiosurgery (such as gamma knife) are undergoing research studies for treatment of TLE and other forms of epilepsy.[citation needed]\n [edit] Social and artistic influence\n [edit] Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and the Arts\n \n As Eve LaPlante discusses in her book, Seized, the intense emotions, sensory experience including vibrancy of colors, and particular mental state provoked by temporal lobe abnormalities may have contributed to the creation of significant works of art. A number of well-known writers and artists are known, or in many cases suspected to have had temporal lobe epilepsy, aggravated, in some cases, by alcoholism. They include Charles Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll), Edgar Allan Poe, Fyodor Dostoevsky (whose novel The XXXXX features a protagonist with epilepsy, Prince Myshkin), Gustave Flaubert, Philip K. Dick, Sylvia Plath and contemporary author Thom Jones. Peter O'Leary has also discussed this in his \"Gnostic Contagion: Robert Duncan and the Poetry of Illness\". Sadi Ranson-Polizzotti has discussed the significance of Lewis Carroll's epilepsy online and in a forthcoming book on the subject.\n [edit] Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, Neurotheology and Paranormal Experience\n \n The first researcher to note and catalog the abnormal experiences associated with TLE was neurologist Norman Geschwind, who noted a constellation of symptoms, including hypergraphia, hyperreligiosity, fainting spells, and pedantism, often collectively ascribed to a condition known as Geschwind syndrome.\n \n Vilayanur S. Ramachandran explored the neural basis of the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE using galvanic skin response (which correlates with emotional arousal) to determine whether the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE was due to an overall heightened emotional state or was specific to religious stimuli (Ramachandran and Blakeslee, 1998). By presenting subjects with neutral, sexually arousing and religious words while measuring GSR, Ramachandran was able to show that patients with TLE showed enhanced emotional responses to the religious words, diminished responses to the sexually charged words, and normal responses to the neutral words. These results suggest that the medial temporal lobe is specifically involved in generating some of the emotional reactions associated with religious words, images and symbols.\n \n Cognitive neuroscience researcher Michael Persinger asserts that stimulating the temporal lobe electromagnetically can cause TLE and trigger hallucinations of apparent paranormal phenomena such as ghosts and UFOs. Persinger has even created a \"God helmet\" which purportedly can evoke altered states of consciousness through stimulation of the parietal and temporal lobes. Neurotheologians speculate that individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy, having a natural tendency to experience states of consciousness such as euphoria or sam&#257;dhi, have functioned in human history as religious figures or shamans.\n [edit] Temporal lobe epilepsy and hormones\n \n Sex hormones can influence the timing and frequency of seizure activity.[citation needed] Estrogen is pro-epileptic and progesterone is anti-epileptic.[citation needed] These counterbalancing effects may account for \"catamenial epilepsy\" i.e. epilepsy preceding or made more severe prior to menstruation or during peri-ovulation. Gender may differentially influence neocortical pathologies in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy.[29]\n \n \n Religious ecstasy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n Religious ecstasy\n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Jump to: navigation, search\n For related topics, see ecstasy (emotion) and ecstasy (philosophy).\n \n Spiritual ecstasy is an altered state of consciousness characterized by greatly reduced external awareness and expanded interior mental and spiritual awareness which is frequently accompanied by hallucinations and emotional/intuitive (and sometimes physical) euphoria. Although the experience is usually brief in physical time[1], there are records of such experiences lasting several days or even more, and of recurring experiences of ecstasy during one's lifetime. Subjective perception of time, space and/or self may strongly change or disappear during ecstasy.\n \n The adjective \"religious\" means that the experience occurs in connection with religious activities or is interpreted in context of a religion. Marghanita Laski writes in her study \"Ecstasy in Religious and Secular Experiences,\" first published in 1961:\n \n \"Epithets are very often applied to mystical experiences including ecstasies without, apparently, any clear idea about the distinctions that are being made. Thus we find experiences given such names as nature, religious, aesthetic, neo-platonic, sexual etc. experiences, where in some cases the name seems to derive from trigger, sometimes from the overbelief, sometimes from the known standing and beliefs of the mystic, and sometimes, though rarely, from the nature of the experience.\n \n Ecstasies enjoyed by accepted religious mystics are usually called religious experiences no matter what the nature of the ecstasy or the trigger inducing it.\"[2]\n \n \n Spiritual ecstasy can be distinguished from spirit possession and hypnosis in that ecstasy is not accompanied by a loss of interior consciousness or will on the part of the subject experiencing it.[citation needed] Rather, the person experiencing ecstasy notices a dramatic heightening of awareness of the spiritual, and a total concentration of the will on it. If the ecstatic state comes about slowly, the subject may notice changes in his or her physiological responses. But, once brought into complete ecstasy, there is ordinarily no or very little external awareness of the physical state of the subject or the surroundings. Some external awareness remains in a partial religious ecstasy. Intense fear may accompany the initial stage of being drawn into ecstasy. Different religious teachings distinguish and describe several stages or forms of ecstasy\n \n Some religious people hold the view that true religious ecstasy occurs only in context of their religion (e.g. as a gift from the supernatural being whom they worship) and it cannot be induced by natural means (human activities). Nevertheless, trance-like states which are often interpreted as religious ecstasy can be deliberately induced using a variety of techniques or ecstatic practices, including prayer, religious rituals, meditation, breathing exercises, physical exercise, sex, music, dancing, sweating, fasting, thirsting, and the consumption of psychotropic drugs. Sometimes an ecstatic experience takes place in occasion of contact with something or somebody perceived as extremely beautiful or holy. It may also happen without any known reason. The particular technique that an individual uses to induce ecstasy is usually one that is associated with that individual's particular religious and cultural traditions. As a result, an ecstatic experience is usually interpreted within the context of a particular individual's religious and cultural traditions. These interpretations often include statements about contact with supernatural or spiritual beings, about receiving new information as a revelation, also religion-related explanations of subsequent change of values, attitudes and behavior (e.g. in case of religious conversion).\n \n Achieving ecstatic trances is a major activity of shamans, who use ecstasy for such purposes as traveling to heaven or the underworld, guiding or otherwise interacting with spirits, clairvoyance, and healing. Some shamans use drugs from such plants as peyote and cannabis (also see cannabis (drug)) or certain mushrooms in their attempts to reach ecstasy, while others rely on such non-chemical means as ritual, music, dance, ascetic practices, or visual designs as aids to mental discipline.\n \n Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: eMedicine Neurology\n \n here is more in depth look at a simpler examination of Temporal Lobe experience.",

Natural selection merely acts to make development in a certain direction more likely by reducing the probability of less desirable traits.\n \n If you somehow got the notion that evolutionists think that natural selection actually builds systems, then you really don't get it.\n\n I am sure that I really do get it.\n \n Natural selection is the only non-random force acting on species over several generations and if it did not build the systems that exist then we do not know where those systems came from. That by the way is my conclusion.\n \nSorry to burst your bubble, but I don't have any \"philosophical insecurities.\" Or religious beliefs. Jesus is the Great and Resurrected Savior of mankind. He is the Great God, the Mighty God, the Prince of Peace, the Alpha and Omega, and the Creator of the Universe. And nothing Xcaliber of her ilk have ever posted in these fora has in any way falsified the historical reality of the Risen Christ.\n \n John 14:6\n \n emoticon_xbouncer\n\n If you were confident in your beliefs but didn't want to argue you wouldn't have logged on. (you had good reasons but don't want to argue them)\n \n If you were confident in your beliefs but did want to argue you would be arguing instead of constantly asserting your beliefs without support.\n \n It seems to me that the only reason one would place themselves in a position where they are expected to defend their statements and then proceed to simply assert them and go no farther is that they, by stating with confidence that something is a fact which they are uncertain about; make that thing more certain in their own mind.\n \n \nI know the meaning, but I also realize that Miracles are as fake as God. Anything you claim as a \" Miracle\" will most likely have a scientific explanation or is a mere coincidence. \n\n Yet you hold a coincidence as a scientific explaination, all that matters to you is that it is not a miracle but I don't believe that coincidences if they be truly that keep happening in the same manner.\n \n The fact that something displays consistent pattern is a clue that it is not a coincidence.\n \n \nI can't believe you would attack a fellow Creationist in such a way. \n\n You must be expert at ignoring data that you can't reconcile by now.\n \n \nAnd What statement are you referring to?\n\n \nNo. I could easily find enough Information to sustain a debate if I thought it would be worth the time and effort , however after witnessing this topic and your conceived notion of debating I find it not worth the time and effort to prove you wrong again. \n \n \n \n Look.. For me, and this is ME, I'm not speaking for anyone else, There is NO GOD. In order for Human kind to have been Created there would have to be a God, deity, Ghost, Supernatural Something or another in order to Theorize the illogical Idea of Creation. So what I'm saying is that it would be completely pointless for me to enter into a one sided debate. If I don't believe in creation then for me that leaves only Evolution. I make no claim to know all the ins and outs of the Theory because to me Science has carried Evolution well past the Theory stage and is more fact than not. I don't want to understand anything about your Creation because for me personally it doesn't exist and isn't worth the effort .\n Now.. Your original Position was that IC is not needed to support ID. You are Claiming that IC is a stand alone Theory independent of ID . You have been PROVEN wrong on that whether you choose to believe it or not. That's not me \" Judging \" a debate. No, that's fact vs. fiction proven in writing that you simply refuse to admit. I may not be as well versed on the subject as some would be but I'm not stupid by any means and can see the evidence before me. You present your own theory/ position yet you can't back it up. even your own sources and evidence has proven your position wrong and yet you still continue. \n \n \n \n I don't think you are qualified to Judge me or my beliefs.\n\n \n \n \n... The FACT that you are a Creationist?. Well Yeah I made that statement, and It still stands . \n\n It stands as an assertion as it always was. Like EZ you may someday discover that calling something a fact does not make it so, and that if you want to demonstrate that it is a fact you will need to support the proposition with others.\n \n \nThere you go proving your Creationist views again..\n\n State the logic that concludes that such a sentence is dependant on creationist beliefs.\n \n \nI see you are also as delusional as your Buddy EZ. So I suppose you were there for the Magical resurrection of the Jewish Zombie?..\n\n Yea, and right afterward he said 'you wana see something even more amazing' and showed us organelles appearing by random chance mutations without selection pressures, gravity then proceeded to reverse and suddenly the clouds formed the letters for the Iliad (in all languages).\n \n \nNo see you are wrong on several counts. It's SCIENTIFICALLY proven that Men do not come back to life after being pronounced dead for 3 days. Jebus didn't do it either and You know this if you have half a brain. \n\n It has also been proven that effects have causes even if you don't know the cause.\n \n \nWell of course Natural selection doesn't build systems, I've never claimed it did...lol..\n\n Irrational evolution claims that variation followed by selection is responsible for all biological structures, which means is responsible for their production, which means caused their construction, which means built them.\n \n \nBefore or after Darwin isn't a part of the equation. Darwin being born didn't have a thing to do with Evolution, and his existance doesn't affect the truth either way. \n\n So you would have come up with it on your own if you had been born before him?\n \n \nReality supports my view on this subject.\n\n For the thousandth time I invite you to make the case so without further delay:\n \n How?\n \n \nThe last thing on this planet I worry about would be EZ and his delusions, well second to last thing. The last thing I worry about is what you have to say about anything.\n\n It seems incredibly likely that this is so of anyone you meet who disagrees with you on debate forums, begging the question; why are you on such sites?\n \n \nand yet you are trying to get into one of those \" Useless duets\" as well are you not?..\n\n I have already told you that my ideal would be for you to snap out of it and argue your position. Argument is not useless, contradiction (taking turns asserting something without supporting statements) is.\n \n \nI really wish you could get over yourself and stop trying to attain the unattainable.\n \n Yes, expecting rationality from you or EZ is unattainable, but I have to keep form.\n \n \nand while you're at it go back to school and learn some proper writing skills. Double spacing is not exactly proper and makes you look Illiterate.\n\n Blank lines OH NO! Who is jebus?",

We have archeological evidence that in time frame that Saul of Tarsus, AKA Paul was born, one of the major religions of Tarsus was indeed Mithraism \n \n \n\n 2) The arrival of Mithras in Europe\n \n The circumstances which brought the god at last to Europe after hundreds of years are indeed strange. According to the historian Plutarch, who lived in the first century A.D., the Romans became acquainted with Mithras through pirates from Cilicia, a province of Asia Minor. These were the pirates who constituted such a threat to Rome until Pompey drove them from the seas.\n \n In his biography of this skilful general, Plutarch writes of the pirates: 'They brought to Olympus in Lycia strange offerings and performed some secret mysteries, which still in the cult of Mithras, first made known by them [the pirates]'. In the middle of the second century A.D. the historian Appian adds that the pirates came to know of the mysteries from the troops who were left behind by the defeated army of Mithridates Eupator. It is well established that all kinds of Eastern races were represented in that army.\n \n There are some well-known monuments associated with Mithras in the pirates' homeland in the mountainous religions of Cilicia, and recently an altar was discovered in Anazarbos which had been consecrated by Marcus Aurelius as 'Priest and Father of Zeus-Helios-Mithras'. The god was also worshipped in Tarsus, the capital of the province, as we know from coins of the Emperor Gordian III which bear a picture of the bull-slayer (Fig. 1.). One of the greatest campaigns against the Persians took place during the reign of Gordian III; the coin has propaganda value as Ernest Will has pointed out: ' L'hommage rendu au dieu perse adopte par Rome, au moment de la campagne contre sa patrie premiere, revet une valeur politique particuliere.'\n \n\n \n It appears from some of the temples found in Tarsus that the form of Mithraism that was being practiced was the Persian version, not the later Roman version.. since the temples predate the Roman adoption of Mithra. \n \n Funny how the main religion of the city of origin of the person who had such an influence of Christianity was Mithra. It couldn't have POSSIBLY influenced him, could it?",

The fact that DNA is unique underlies analysis in criminal investigations and it doesn't go further than that. Forensic specialist don't go 'ah oh thank you evolution for happening so that we have this complicated DNA' before their tests.\n \n If that is an application of evolution because it is a facet of biological life, then human life is an application of evolution and I would have given that as the first example.\n \n 2. and three are 3. of what I call rational evolution, irrational evolution has never been witnessed so of course it can't be observed on a regular basis in a laboratory.\n \n before you put your foot in your mouth again you may want to review and see that I immediately followed up by pointing out what I think the differences between rational and irrational evolution are.\n \n 4. This one especially drove home the point that this list consists primarily of any optimization cycles what so ever and that the term evolution was simply slapped onto it, like saying 'the evolution of the earth' it doesn't really belong.\n \n I am somewhat of a computer scientist and if I could solve problems by applying magical evolution, I would do it all the time. The simple truth is the only time where iterative optimization cycles are applied is where you can't work it out mathematically or it's not worth it to do so.\n \n No algorithm has been made that can write good software I assure you and that is what irrational evolution would mean in computer terms.\n \n If you set parameters that presuppose operable solutions and just start trying things you are basically writing the solution in and letting the computer find the final answer in a very inefficient way. I bring your attention to the code that ran for this clock experiment.\n \n It does not translate to evolution or reality for a very simple reason, the code was written to assume functionality at every point. At 4:24 he notes that a pendulum alone is considered an operating clock, software doesn't work by magic and he hard coded that.\n \n Similarly if in nature you had some algorithm which is capable of recognizing that something is part of a future functional system we could expect similar results.\n \n I have run some primitive experiments of my own which are missing the key incorrect assumption in these models, namely that it is proper to check for similarity with predefined functional systems in the selection phase of the algorithm. Current functionality must not be linked to future functionality as it is in this example and in the minds of those who support irrational evolution.\n \n \n \nYou completely ignored the facts placed at your feet and again asserted your position which was something to do with IC.\n\n You mean that I explained that my definition of irrational evolution (the popular definition) did not apply?\n \n \nThen later you came back in a post and admitted you did not support Evolution\n\n That is blatently obvious.\n \n \nin fact You never once posted what You do support.\n\n In the conspiracy thread I was only affirmatively supporting the laws of logic by condemning formal and informal fallacies.\n \n \nYou beat around the bush about your position \n\n No I make it abundantly clear, it's just not a position which fits into your list of position categories and so you assume it can't be authentic.\n \n \nand ignore any evidence that goes against your position, whatever it may be. \n\n The only evidence offered against my position in that thread was appeals to authority, authorities that those citing them didn't even respect.\n \n \nYou said you don't Support Evolution..\n\n Irrational evolution, correct.\n \n \nYou said You were for IC\n\n I believe IC is sound yes.\n \n \nIC is the base for intelligent design, and has been proven false by more than one scientist..\n\n 1.

I don't even know why I'm posting because you will ignore everything and argue it's wrong, without any evidence to prove otherwise. but hey, I'll give it a shot maybe you'll finally admit you are a creationist....\n \n Irreducible complexity, intelligent design's closest brush with biology, is marked by three ironies.\n \n * IC is supposed to be important because it cannot evolve. But it can evolve, in the same ways that anything else does.\n * Not one of the impressively complex biochemical systems said to be IC by IC/ID proponents has been shown to be in fact IC and several are known not to be. The known cases of IC are simpler and their evolution is understood.\n * Although the subject is religiously motivated, proponents have focused on bacterial flagella as the last hope for a highly complex IC system. This has the unintended consequence of making The Designer (aka God) responsible for serious diseases.\n \n It is easy to see why scientists are not impressed by the claim that IC cannot evolve. IC is a matter of an observer specifying a combination of function, parts and system so that the specified function requires all the parts. There is no way for evolution to be sensitive to this, no way for it to matter at all. Nor does nature care about 'direct' vs 'indirect' evolution as perceived by us. Indirect evolution is as normal as tails on cows. Evolution merely requires populations with heritable variation. The processes of mutation, natural selection and random drift are not sensitive to whether a change will be deemed direct or not, nor whether a function, system and parts as specified by some observer are changing to meet the 'all parts required' condition.\n \n There was supposed to be a special reason why it was impossible or at least very difficult for evolution to arrive at an 'all parts required' situation, but there is no such reason. The proposed reason was based on overlooking standard evolutionary processes and making analogies to manufactured items. Comparing Behe's mousetrap to Venus' flytrap confirms the reasonable suspicion that analogies and arguments based on manufactured items lead to underestimating nature. Since IC can occur in the ordinary course of events we have a known process, evolution, which is acting in the present and which given time is sufficient to produce the adaptations that Behe finds perplexing. This is like the raising of the Rocky Mountains; a known process acting in the present is sufficient, given time, to produce the result. Of course there is no way to predict all the details in either case, nor is it necessary.\n \n Finally, this version of 'gap theology', basing the Designer on gaps or purported gaps in our knowledge (which is not mainstream religion), ends up implicating the Designer in human disease. This makes ID rather questionable as a public school lesson. Gap theology is bad enough at best, and always has the problem that the gaps keep getting smaller. This new version of it is especially bad. Darwin did theologians a favor by freeing them from this sort of thing.\n \n Despite all this, there is a strong political drive to force public schools to misrepresent neocreationism as science. But misrepresentation is not acceptable. And it would be awkward to tell teachers to teach ID science when there isn't any. If it becomes politically necessary to teach something about the subject, the present essay contains material for several lessons. And if the plan is to teach 'the controversy', it would be proper to tell the students that there is no scientific controversy, although there is a public one. Books like Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution are surely part of the reason. Yet the widespread public acceptance of Behe's thesis is stark evidence that we need stronger science education, especially about evolution. \n \n \n Irreducible Complexity Demystified",

Second it has some similarities with the Mosaic Law of Moses [1500 BC]. This led to some arguments that Moses who lived around three centuries after Hammurabi borrowed his law from Hammurabi. However the similarities are limited and often superficial. For example, in the Mosaic Law, the &#8220;eye for an eye&#8221; principle is universal. In the Hammurabi Law [Code 196] the &#8220;eye for an eye&#8221; principle only applies if both parties are of equal status (i.e. lower class, middle class, upper class, clerical, nobility, etc.). Anyone who reads the Code of Hammurabi and then the Ten Commandments would see that the differences are much greater than the similarities, and the similarities are due to the common needs of societies.\" [http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site]\n \n The DIFFERENCES in the laws, however, are most striking, esp. between Israel (e.g. Moses) and Babylonia (i.e. Hammurapi). The strongest difference is in the relative worth of human life.

There is no way for evolution to be sensitive to this, no way for it to matter at all. Nor does nature care about 'direct' vs 'indirect' evolution as perceived by us. Indirect evolution is as normal as tails on cows. Evolution merely requires populations with heritable variation. The processes of mutation, natural selection and random drift are not sensitive to whether a change will be deemed direct or not, nor whether a function, system and parts as specified by some observer are changing to meet the 'all parts required' condition.\n \n There was supposed to be a special reason why it was impossible or at least very difficult for evolution to arrive at an 'all parts required' situation, but there is no such reason. The proposed reason was based on overlooking standard evolutionary processes and making analogies to manufactured items. Comparing Behe's mousetrap to Venus' flytrap confirms the reasonable suspicion that analogies and arguments based on manufactured items lead to underestimating nature. Since IC can occur in the ordinary course of events we have a known process, evolution, which is acting in the present and which given time is sufficient to produce the adaptations that Behe finds perplexing. This is like the raising of the Rocky Mountains; a known process acting in the present is sufficient, given time, to produce the result. Of course there is no way to predict all the details in either case, nor is it necessary.\n \n Finally, this version of 'gap theology', basing the Designer on gaps or purported gaps in our knowledge (which is not mainstream religion), ends up implicating the Designer in human disease. This makes ID rather questionable as a public school lesson. Gap theology is bad enough at best, and always has the problem that the gaps keep getting smaller. This new version of it is especially bad. Darwin did theologians a favor by freeing them from this sort of thing.\n \n Despite all this, there is a strong political drive to force public schools to misrepresent neocreationism as science. But misrepresentation is not acceptable. And it would be awkward to tell teachers to teach ID science when there isn't any. If it becomes politically necessary to teach something about the subject, the present essay contains material for several lessons. And if the plan is to teach 'the controversy', it would be proper to tell the students that there is no scientific controversy, although there is a public one. Books like Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution are surely part of the reason. Yet the widespread public acceptance of Behe's thesis is stark evidence that we need stronger science education, especially about evolution. \n \n \n Irreducible Complexity Demystified\n\n I promise to read and respond to the entire article in return for a promise from you.\n \n I want you to either give a reasoned response devoid of fallacies as far as your wit allows (I will start a thread) or admit that you are not willing to argue in the same thread.\n \n Oh and respond binds me only to answer points of contradiction, I in no way pledge to disagree with everything in the article.\n \n \nYou've got nothing.\n\n Oh thats the que for the next counter-assertion.

   "Where's your evidence Moses ever borrowed anything from Hammurabi? \n \n \"First, the Hammurabi code is one of the oldest set of laws discovered by modern archaeologist. Second it has some similarities with the Mosaic Law of Moses [1500 BC]. This led to some arguments that Moses who lived around three centuries after Hammurabi borrowed his law from Hammurabi. However the similarities are limited and often superficial. For example, in the Mosaic Law, the \"eye for an eye\" principle is universal. In the Hammurabi Law [Code 196] the \"eye for an eye\" principle only applies if both parties are of equal status (i.e. lower class, middle class, upper class, clerical, nobility, etc.). Anyone who reads the Code of Hammurabi and then the Ten Commandments would see that the differences are much greater than the similarities, and the similarities are due to the common needs of societies.\" [http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site]\n \n The DIFFERENCES in the laws, however, are most striking, esp. between Israel (e.g. Moses) and Babylonia (i.e. Hammurapi). The strongest difference is in the relative worth of human life. A comparison of the two legal collections shows that the H-code has a much higher severity for property-offenses, whereas the M-code has a much higher severity for homicide. http://christianthinktank.com/aecy.html\n \n Why those extremely important differences if Moses copied Hammurabi??\n \n You've got nothing.\n\n \n Wrong again Dolmite.. \n \n Parallels with Mosaic Code.\n \n The laws concerning marriage and inheritance, property and punishments, show much similarity to the regulations of the Torah. Genesis xvi. 3 and xxx. 3, where the relation of Sarah to Hagar, and of Rachel to Bilhah, is spoken of, have light thrown upon them by paragraph 145 of Hammurabi's code: \"If a man takes a wife and she bears him children and he desires to take a concubine-if he takes the concubine into his house, this concubine shall not be equal to the wife.\" In Lev. xx. 10 and Deut. xxii. 22 it is decreed that in case of adultery on the part of a wife both parties to the guilt shall be put to death; paragraph 129 of Hammurabi's code corresponds to this: \"If any man's wife is found lying with another man, they shall both be bound and thrown into the water.\" Exactly the same law is found in Deut. xxii. 25-26 as in the code, paragraph 130: \"If any one forces the betrothed of another, who has not yet known a man and is still living in her father's house-if he is found lying with her, he shall be put to death, but the, woman shall be guiltless.\" An accusation brought against a woman by her husband is decided by appealing to God's judgment: the \"jealousy offering\" in Num. v. 11-31 is a parallel. Paragraphs 7 and 122 treat of the business of depositing goods (comp. Ex. xxii. 6-7); paragraph 176 assures to the public steward the right of holding property (comp. Gen. xv. 2; II Sam. ix. 2, 9, 10). Paragraph 117 sheds light on II Kings iv. 1; Isa. xxvii. 2, l. 1; it shows that bondage for debt, which could be made to include the whole family, terminated in the fourth year, as against the seventh according to Mosaic law (comp. Ex. xxi. 2).\n \n The story is told that Hammurabi accepted the Code from the Sun God Shamish on a mountain top. The code was then carved into stone and given to the people.. Sound Familiar?..\n \n The big difference is that we actually have the Stone carvings , found in 1901.. But your ten Commandments are nowhere to be found.\n \n When Hammurabi was alive and king over Babylon your GOD didn't even exist. People worshiped sun gods or trees, or whatever they wanted to worship. Most everyone of that time Worshiped more than one God. Abraham came along a few hundred years later and Created the Jewish God , which he borrowed from Egypt. It even says so in your Bible, in Hosea 13:4\n \n Yet I [am] the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for [there is] no savior beside me.\n \n Now you will claim this meant something different, but I'm on to your game already so that won't fly. This scripture either means GOD was borrowed from Egypt or he was Created AFTER the Jews fled Egypt. Either way he didn't exist until he was created by man and imagination.\n \n You have nothing...",

Either life has always been here since its creation (possibly with minor changes along the way), or life has developed (evolved) from common ancestors. \n \n You've said in the past that 'evidence for common descent' isn't evidence for evolution. Do you believe that life came from a common ancestor (developed), and that the mechanism for evolution is wrong (and that it may be something different)?

Or do you just plead ignorance on the whole issue and just state what you believe isn't the answer?\n \n I realize you don't want to be labeled, or put into a category. I know you probably think you will be attacked based on the label itself rather than the merits of your arguments, and judging from the way you have jumped into every thread Xcalibur has posted in bringing up the whole creationist thing, I am pretty sure it annoys you.

Another thread hijacked. But, really... I understand the 'false dichotomy,' and while I'm not one to accept a fallacy like that\n\n Can you identify it when you see it?\n \"And no I do not believe in a false dichotomy. It's a Simple FACT that either we evolved or we were created. At least for the time being those are the only options on the table so to speak, unless you add that we might have been placed here by some alien race, but I choose to not believe that so it comes down to Evolution or Creationism. So enlighten me , why is this a false dichotomy?.. is there another way that we got here on this planet that I'm not aware of?... \"\n \n \nI'd like to know what you (Freedom) think the other options are outside of life being created or developed through natural processes.\n\n Well that is a matter of definitions.\n \n Created whether by aliens or god or whatever can clearly be defined as unnatural and in fact the only unnatural (again by definition and the way the word is used).\n \n Therefore all creation/design = unnatural origin.\n \n There is a true dichotomy -< Life either had an unnatural origin or a natural origin.\n \n Which as I have just shown is equivalent to -< Life either had a natural origin or was created.\n \n So there are no alternatives.\n \n The dichotomy becomes false when one assumes sufficient knowledge on all possibilities when such knowledge does not exist (as of then). That has been possible for processes and events which we can study from all angles and indeed as it's happening but for life that is not true and may not be true for a long time for all I know.\n \n \nI'm not saying those are for sure the only two options (don't want to be accused of an argument from ignorance)\n\n They are by definition.\n \n \nbut it is very difficult to think of any other options. Either life has always been here since its creation (possibly with minor changes along the way), or life has developed (evolved) from common ancestors. \n\n So what you are saying is evolution is the only natural explaination we have come up with.\n \n That is true.\n \n It is also true that given the evidence common descent is proven so the explaination must produce common descent.\n \n What is not true however is that it is proper to use the word evolution in so many senses that it loses all meaning; for instance you just used it a synomonous with an observation.\n \n Common descent is not a process nor a explanatory theory of advancing life, it is a fact.\n \n Yet I am sure that in the next heartbeat evolution would mean those things when someone needs it to.\n \n \nYou've said in the past that 'evidence for common descent' isn't evidence for evolution. Do you believe that life came from a common ancestor (developed), and that the mechanism for evolution is wrong (and that it may be something different)?\n\n The mechanism of evolution is wrong. It need not be something else, but certainly either something else or something more.\n \n As a conceptual example imagine that for a hundred years alchemist were performing a reaction which consumed O2 and substance X and required heat.\n \n The alchemist insist that clearly the reaction requires heat and substance X, a young Dalton analog, however; armed with the principle of conservation of mass believes that he has proven that the process of heating X cannot produce the resultant chemicals.\n \n He declares that the X + heat theory is inherently flawed and unable to explain the data.\n \n We are looking at a similar situation here, heat and X are certainly required but just because we have pieces to the puzzle does not mean it is solved and we may not ignore sound logic no matter how convenient it might be.\n \n \nDo you believe only in 'micro-evolution' and that something else had to happen before?\n\n I don't have a full theory of life or I would have published it and they would be calling me Darwin II, in fact I haven't a clue; what speculations I may have are both common and unremarkable.\n \n Micro-evolution macro-evolution hum bug; clearly labels spouted by creationist who don't know what they are talking about.\n \n A process is a process whether it happens in 10 minutes or 2 million years, if it can happen at all it is by definition possible given the right circumstances. Whether those circumstances are proposed to not exist on the large scale I have never heard from anyone. It seems to me that some persons, confused about what they think is impossible slapped on a qualification after someone showed them natural selection working in the lab.\n \n \nOr do you just plead ignorance on the whole issue and just state what you believe isn't the answer?\n\n Basically, not ignorance of what I think isn't the answer though :p\n \n \nI realize you don't want to be labeled, or put into a category.\n\n I shouldn't care if the label could be supported in even the most limited way. I for instance have taken on the label of randian, objectivist, rightist, republican, libertarian all because those who named me these things defined the label in such a way that I did fit them.\n \n \nI know you probably think you will be attacked based on the label itself rather than the merits of your arguments\n\n It wastes time but that has already happened.\n \n \nand judging from the way you have jumped into every thread Xcalibur has posted in bringing up the whole creationist thing, \n\n Lol, review and come to me with the times I brought up anything to do with creationism.\n \n I post in many threads and I have consistently pointed out hypocrisy as self-contradiction is the surest sign of invalidity.\n \n \nI am pretty sure it annoys you.\n\n I have said in pretty clear language that members who act as Xcaliber and EZ annoy me to the greatest extent possible and that was in fact the subject of my first posts on this 'hijacked' thread.\n \n \nEverybody already thinks your just a creationist in hiding,\n\n Rofl, I always let out a little sigh when someone starts talking in the plural.\n \n Have you polls to determine this? How can you have everyone when I am one?\n \n \nso why don't you just clearly state where you stand?\n\n I answer questions, I volunteer my position where it seems necessary or wanted.\n \n I have clearly stated my position on any theory of life several times both in the conspiracy thread and just now in my response to you.\n \n \nMan made Gods are not really Gods\n\n I don't know, I saw chuck norris fighting....\n \n \nUntil something conclusive comes along we must do our best to find it. At least there has been a shift from a belief system to a fact system. Yes I know both are being used but the balance is shifting is my point\n\n Unfortunately it seems to me ever more clear facts are destroying the theory.\n \n I am taking some long offered advice (from many) and reading OOS and I am some what stunned at how well I understood ToE (given how many people insisted that I do not), I am even more confident (it was hard to be more confident than I was) that my arguments are sound and that assumptions were made which have not panned out, especially about variation and divergence of structure.\n \n \nYes, but still not an entity\n\n kk\n \n \nThankfully it didn't happen that way so you can make this statement. It is difficult to honestly project what would be if the experiences of your life and world were completly different. You would not be you.\n\n Influences change but logic remains solid.\n \n \nThat curse is also a blessing. Man's unwillingness to accept what he doesn't know has caused him to create an answer that did more harm than good, but more often it was the cause of discovery and progress.\n\n Do not confuse the acceptance of ignorance with surrender to it, I endorse full fledged pursuit of knowledge in all things, but I say it is a mockery of that pursuit and those who give their lives to it to pretend as if what they pursue can be had at the cost of fantasizing.\n \n \n \nNo but like most you probably would have given it much more of a possibility than you do now\n\n We have no less evidence for spirits now than we did then.\n \n You are right I can't predict what I would be without some influences, I was not particularly logical in all things (in what I considered the unimportant things) before I was exposed to several philosophical texts.\n \n After I arrived at my current philosophy I can be fairly confident that all my conclusions would be the same. Not all philosophies can say that though.\n \n \nYou would also probably be burned at the stake, that goes a long way in making a convincing argument, but today we are smarter and have more freedom than those who came before us.\n\n A terrifying prospect, but in reference to truth; still just an appeal to force informal fallacy.",

   "What personal observations have allowed you to setup your dichotomy and conclude that IC supports ID?\n\n \n I never concluded any such thing.. Behe concluded that IC supports ID, Behe Coined the term Irreducible Complexity in an attempt to dis-prove evolution. Many Scientists believe that IC supports ID. IC is the central argument used by ID's to support their position. This isn't me stating it it's common knowledge. \n \n My personal view is that IC doesn't support anything. I don't support Intelligent Design, IC is the Central Argument used to support ID, therefore I don't support IC either. \n \n I still stand by my original statement and NO I'm not going to re-post why, I've told you several times and you continue to call it a false Dichotomy which it is not. Funny How you said the same thing I did yet you call it a false Dichotomy... \n \n \n\n Well that is a matter of definitions.\n Created whether by aliens or god or whatever can clearly be defined as unnatural and in fact the only unnatural (again by definition and the way the word is used).\n Therefore all creation/design = unnatural origin.\n There is a true dichotomy -< Life either had an unnatural origin or a natural origin.\n Which as I have just shown is equivalent to -< Life either had a natural origin or was created.\n So there are no alternatives.\n The dichotomy becomes false when one assumes sufficient knowledge on all possibilities when such knowledge does not exist (as of then). That has been possible for processes and events which we can study from all angles and indeed as it's happening but for life that is not true and may not be true for a long time for all I know.\n\n \n I don't assume to have sufficient Knowledge of all possibilities, I clearly said that Evolution and/or Creation were the only two KNOWN possibilities. That is assuming there may be others, but they have yet to be discovered. Of the two KNOWN possibilities you either support one or the other, or you don't support either. Your OPINION that Evolution is wrong is simply that, YOUR OPINION. You've not posted substantial evidence to disprove what scientists have known for years.",

The majority of the Islamic countries surrounding Israel have made it clear their primary goal is the destruction of Israel. However, God has made it clear that Israel is here to stay.

Have a restless night.\n\n \n sorry, your misguided belief can't trump history...\n \n The state of Israel was proclaimed by the Jewish leader, David Ben Gurion, on May 14, 1948, and officially came into being on the 15th, after British Mandatory rule ended at midnight. In many minds, the birth of Israel is closely identified with the Nazi terror in Europe and the Holocaust, but in fact the conception of and planning for a Jewish state had begun some 60 years earlier. OVERNIGHT MY XXX..LMAO\n The Messianic idea of returning the Jews to their \"promised land\" had been a Puritan religious belief since the 16th Century. In the mid-19th Century, British politicians saw another value: that of having in place in the Middle East a Jewish entity sympathetic to the British Empire.\n Two phenomena made real these and the Jews' own previously vague aspirations of \"return\": the burgeoning European nationalism of the time, from which the Jews felt excluded; and the massacres, or pogroms, carried out by Tsarist Russia against its six million Jews, the largest single Jewish population in Europe, which spread into the Ukraine and Poland. \n \n RaceandHistory.com - The Birth of Isreal\n \n Didn't happen Overnight, and \"GOD\" had nothing to do with it.

I have been praying and hoping that what I am about to write may be averted. However, I am now concerned that without prophetic people speaking up, we will not play our redemptive part in bringing change for the good. \n \n FIVE ELEMENTS OF THE BREWING PERFECT STORM As in the movie The Perfect Storm, the storm I see coming to the United States is a combination of more than one element, and when the elements unite, the storm becomes exponentially more dangerous. However, unlike the movie, this storm is not just a storm of merging weather patterns. This storm is worse; it involves five different elements: religion, politics, economics, war and geo-physical events. \n \n At times these five elements will be so intertwined that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish which events are driving a particular manifestation of the storm. Massive problems in these five areas will come often, or in combination, and sometimes repeatedly. Each element has potentially several events that will have national and international ripple effects. Some ripples will be worse than others, depending on where you live and how you make your living. Different areas of the United States will experience different severities. Some will experience more economic elements, others more geo-physical elements; some will experience all elements. Remember, it is the combination and the rapidity that will make the storm problematic.\n \n Also, this does not mean all five elements will hit at the most devastating levels. For example, on a scale of 1&#8211;10 with 10 being the worst, one element may strike at a six while another strikes at an eight. It is the particular combinations of elements &#8212; the proximity of each element as well as the intensity of each element &#8212; that will make this storm so difficult and seem to last so long. This storm will not be short-lived; it will come in waves, one after another.\n \n WHY IS THE STORM COMING? This storm is coming because the Church (the Body of Christ) is no longer the backbone of this nation. From our inception, the Christian faith has been the plumb line of decisions made at all levels of life. The Christian founding of this nation is what makes it different from every other nation, other than perhaps Israel. Other nations may have become Christian in their focus, but none were initially formed with Christianity as the core of its DNA.\n \n The Church is to make known God&#8217;s manifold wisdom to the world and the powers of the air (Ephesians 2:2). This demonstration to the heavens is not accomplished by speaking to those powers but through righteous living. How we live opens or closes doors for Satan to legally afflict us and even rule over us via leaders who do not know the ways of God. From Adam and Eve through today, the actions of humankind have given room for the enemy to strike and attack us. The only legal way the enemy has access to us is when the hand of God lifts from us, resulting in a space between Him and us. This space increases as we distance ourselves from Him and His ways.\n \n Anytime there is an increased distance between God and humanity, it leaves room for attack to come and for principalities and powers of the air (rulers of darkness) to take up residence. The longer dark powers reside over an area, the more the people begin to call right wrong and wrong right. Here in the United States, leaders arise from the people; in other words, as the people believe and think, so do the leaders who rise from their ranks. Eventually, the lines between right and wrong, as well as the holy and profane, become blurred. The way to God through Jesus and the Cross is no longer seen as an absolute. In fact, absolutes become touted as &#8220;intolerance&#8221; first in the world and then even within the Church. Yes, there are exceptions to this thinking within the Church, but through compromise, the absolutes of Heaven and eternity are clearly evaporating. \n \n GOD CAN FASHION A DISASTER We are living in the days of Ezekiel and Jeremiah, who prophesied that God can bring disaster on a nation if that nation continually chooses to walk according to its own plans. God spoke this to Jeremiah: \n \n &#8220;The instant I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, to pull down, and to destroy it, if that nation against whom I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I thought to bring upon it. And the instant I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it, if it does evil in My sight so that it does not obey My voice, then I will relent concerning the good with which I said I would benefit it. \n \n &#8220;Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, &#8216;Thus says the LORD: &#8220;Behold, I am fashioning a disaster and devising a plan against you. Return now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; \n \n And they said, &#8220;&#8230; We will walk according to our own plans, and we will every one obey the dictates of his evil heart.&#8221; &#8212; Jeremiah 18:7&#8211;12 \n \n WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE COMING? What are some of the things/consequences that will come? In time, water will be more expensive than oil, and cities will evacuate thousands because there is not enough water to meet their needs. (As Amos 4:7 says, &#8220;I made it rain on one city, I withheld rain from another city.&#8221;) Earthquakes will strike not only coastal areas but devastate the Midwest as well. Israel will bomb Iran, and anti-Semitism will escalate as fuel costs soar. A dirty bomb will explode in a coastal city. There will be thunderstorms with huge hail, 24 inches of rain in 24 hours, three feet of snow in six hours, record-setting tornadoes with winds of more than 350 miles per hour and tornadoes in unusual places. There will be an unexpected blight that will hit various hybrid seed crops and weaken the yield. In addition, drought and devastation from storms will dramatically cut into various harvests and the national food storage will deplete.\n \n &#8220;Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, &#8216;Thus says the LORD: &#8220;Behold, I am fashioning a disaster and devising a plan against you. Return now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; Jeremiah 18:11\n \n FOUR THINGS THE CHURCH MUST DO First, the Church must return to knowing God and His ways rather than just knowing about God. We have replaced power with programs, revelation with administration and the Father&#8217;s heart with organizational skills.\n \n Second, the Church must learn how to contend for the faith again. We are weak, and we fall away so easily when crisis is not at hand. We have not been tested, and we have lost our resolve. We understand little of the adversary&#8217;s plans. We do not know how to debate our faith without becoming angry, and thus we have so few strong, clear, godly voices in political arenas. We have lost our witness &#8212; the witness that convicts others and strongly testifies that God is still God and is very, very real. We have lost the witness that demonstrates that God is a personal God in a very impersonal world, the witness that says, &#8220;What I do proves God exists.&#8221;\n \n Third, the Church must return to the love of God&#8217;s Word and the belief that it is infallible and inerrant. This would include the conviction, understanding and knowledge that God is absolute, and there is only one way to know Him: through Jesus the Messiah. We need a new revelation that God&#8217;s power is unlimited, His knowledge is unending, His presence is with us always and He never changes. We have made God far too small, and our lives prove it.\n \n Fourth, we will need to declare sacred and solemn assemblies of repentance and corporate fasting in many parts of this nation &#8212; a time set aside for rending our hearts before God.\n \n &#8220;Now, therefore,&#8221; says the LORD, &#8220;Turn to Me with all your heart, With fasting, with weeping, and with mourning.&#8221; So rend your heart, and not your garments; Return to the LORD your God, For He is gracious and merciful, Slow to anger, and of great kindness; And He relents from doing harm. Who knows if He will turn and relent, And leave a blessing behind Him &#8212; A grain offering and a drink offering For the LORD your God? \n \n Blow the trumpet in Zion, Consecrate a fast, Call a sacred assembly; Gather the people, Sanctify the congregation, Assemble the elders, Gather the children and nursing babes; Let the bridegroom go out from his chamber, And the bride from her dressing room. Let the priests, who minister to the LORD, Weep between the porch and the altar; Let them say, &#8220;Spare Your people, O LORD.&#8221; &#8212; Joel 2:12&#8211;17\n \n CRISIS IS THE FRUIT OF FOLLOWING THE WRONG GOD God allows calamities to happen in order to draw us to Himself. What does that mean? It means that God allows us to reap the fruit of that which we serve. Walking in God&#8217;s ways brings blessings and fullness of life, while walking in the ways of the &#8220;god of this world&#8221; will bring the fruit of the god of this world: decay, destruction, deterioration and death. We make our choice, then the choice makes us. Sadly, we are developing a history of wrong choices.\n \n Throughout Scripture, when crises hit the people of God, they turned their hearts to Him, and He heard and took action. \n \n Then you will call upon Me and go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart. &#8212; Jeremiah 29:12&#8211;13\n \n May the people of the United States seek the Lord &#8230; and find Him. Remember, we still have the promise that if we turn from our wicked ways, God will heal our land.\n \n Serving God and His Kingdom, John Paul Jackson August 2008 \n\n \n There. I highlighted the most obvious parts which specifically point to the US. Paul even clearly states the following:\n \n \nThis storm is coming because the Church (the Body of Christ) is no longer the backbone of this nation.

Other nations may have become Christian in their focus, but none were initially formed with Christianity as the core of its DNA.\n\n He spells out that god is removing his protection from this nation (speaking of the US) because this nation has turned it's back on god. First off, I find it highly arrogant to think that god would care about one nation over any other. I think that if a single god existed that was the root of all creation, we would all be his chosen people. Second, Paul states that we (speaking of the US) are going to be hit by wave after wave of disaster, which clearly we have not. Citing events in Japan and New Zealand really has no bearing on a prophecy concerning the US (but I understand...it's all you got to work with).",

Christians go 'look the universe exists, so our god must have created it'.\n \n A person's ability to spew an explaination is not in question, whether we have any self-consistent sound explanations is.

   "I never objected to the idea that free will actively allows man to \"sin.\" \n \n Your answer to my question is a very lame one, for we all know that on earth, Christians are very susceptible to sin (like anyone). Nobody's perfect, and even the most die hard Christians will sin (even Peter denied Christ thrice). \n \n If that changes when you get to heaven, and there is no sin but still free will, then your answer about \"choosing\" not to sin is BS. Something would have to change to allow both free will and no sin, and if that is possible, then all the suffering, death, sadness, and sorrow was all avoidable. What was the point of it if God could make us all have free will, but simple not \"want\" to sin? If God could have given man free will, but man's choices would only be non-sinful, why didn't he? How does this not make him the most despicable creature ever?\n \n Your response?\n\n \n When are you going to answer my question instead of dancing around it?\n \n Show me how God can create man with free will and not allow the individual to do good or evil? You expect him to create preprogrammed robots that can only do good?\n \n What's the \"Better Way\" according to you?\n \n When Christians get to heaven they are (as the Bible says) \"Raised incorruptible\" (without the earthly, sinful nature). It's a work of God, not man. And since that's what we choose when we choose Christ, then it's all according to free will.",

   "You got to be kidding me, I could poop a better argument than that.\n \n What I had in mind as the objective other person is a psychiatrist. It's widely known that people are not equipped to analyze themselves, just ask your psychiatrist.\n \n the fact that you try to make an argument against something so widely known, rational and agreed up on says a lot about all your arguments. You would argue that black is white or some other ridiculous notion. I get the impression that you choose to argue from indefensible positions to improve your debating skills, the problem is it's not helping you one bit.\n\n That those who oppose my arguments often revert to what EZ is doing says a lot about both my arguments and those who oppose them.\n \n It comes in many forms and has many masks but dismissal is still dismissal whether you disguise it with insults, half truths about what was said, or most commonly by asserting that the argument was already defeated.\n \n Most of your posts are crude insults, meaningless comments, and asserted dismissals. The ratio seemed 1/8 last time I checked (the 1 being a useful post).\n \n This is a debate site, do you know what debate is, what it means?\n \n It means many things but most importantly it means a commitment to reason. \n \n Asking for a second opinion is a small part of the beginning of the path that leads to true debate.\n \n Debate is elevated above merely asking for the beliefs of others, it asks also for their reasons.\n \n A debate begins by people stating their opinions, but consists of comparing with logic the reasons people hold those opinions. Further debate does not limit itself to a single other person but extends to anyone who wishes to offer their reasons.\n \n It establishes so so much more than a second opinion, it ideally validates opinions based on the best rationale that exists in the minds of any participants.\n \n \"I ought to ask for a second opinion on my beliefs\"?\n \n We ought to be asking for reasons from everyone.\n \n I have got a second opinion, and a third and a fourth. I know your opinion.\n \n Some have given me what they think are good reasons, you haven't yet progressed beyond giving your opinion although you have regressed somewhat in that you make it known in the most obnoxious way you can find.\n \n Yet you suggest that I should find a second opinion. What do you think would happen?\n \n I could find someone who agrees with me on something, that is as inevitable as finding someone who disagrees with me on something.\n \n I won't find anyone who agrees with me on everything.\n \n Let's say I find someone who disagrees with me, what should I do then? What would you do? Would you conclude that you must have been wrong and drop what ever you thought before? If so than in my opinion you are wrong in ever disagreeing with me drop it.\n \n Would you think it didn't matter? Would you consider how often the person has been right before, i.e. your respect for their intellectual prowess? Would you ask them why?\n \n I do all but the former, even for people I don't know like you.\n \n So let's go back to your original statement, that I should get a second opinion on whether I was committing more fallacies since I met you.\n \n Could debate even exist in a world where it wasn't possible to identify fallacies? Would anyone who knew anything about reason or logic even confuse an argument with a person?\n \n Well since you said 'are not equipped to analyze themselves' it seems you are a case of the latter.\n \n \nYou can believe or not believe. But if you people prefer to wind up in Hell it's no sweat off my back. At least I warned you.\n\n You did warn me, and I have no similar threat to offer you. If you are wrong then you will have wasted your life not your death, and you would never know.\n \n \nShow me how God can create man with free will and not allow the individual to do good or evil?\n\n Whenever anyone points out apparent contradiction in God's thought processes it seems to come down to \"you can't understand God's reasons\".\n \n Yet here you seem to assert that God is not capable of coming up with a way to create a world without evil.\n \n \nYou expect him to create preprogrammed robots that can only do good?\n\n No, I think the most logical thing to do would be to create creatures with reason, i.e. their actions are a result of a logical extrapolation on their knowledge; then deny them that knowledge as my primary commandment, then create a creature of absolute evil to tempt them. Then condemn them to live in abject ignorance where their only chance at salvation is to somehow choose to believe in me.\n \n Then I would take pity (I must have changed my mind because I didn't want to take pity and stop the temptation of the pure evil creature I happened to let loose upon the universe) and detach part of myself manifest in a human being give a long list of sermons and parables, even perform some miracles and then get killed so that my hemoglobin rich fluids could save the masses from their own evil.\n \n Gosh, I guess it all makes sense.\n \n Think about this, If God created the whole universe than he created every concept in it, including that of good and evil.\n \n How is it that you except good and evil from the list of god's creations and insist that he was incapable of creating creatures of free will without allowing evil?\n \n You claim (by implication) that a life without sin cannot exist while free will exists.\n \n Does that mean freedom is the cause of sin?\n \n You think that god's grace can help man resist temptation, why did he not give that grace in it's fullest to adam and eve or were they the most corrupt humans that have ever existed to have fallen even then?\n \n Was he unable to stop the serpent from tempting them or was it necessary to tempt adam and eve to prove their worth? Why wouldn't he have known their worth, why wouldn't he have created perfect beings?\n \n Does god have freewill? If he does but merely is so good that he could never do evil why could he have not placed this iron will in man and angels? (again assuming good and evil exist outside of god)\n \n Could man really commit evil if they knew for certain that God existed and eternal damnation waited at the other side of their sin?\n \n If the answer is no than why hasn't god saved us all by the simplest means possible, revealing himself and warning us each one of us?\n \n You may say he has but why did he choose to prove that he exists only to a select few in a roman province 2000 years ago?\n \n Was he not powerful enough for more or are we no longer allowed to ask why God supposedly does things?\n \n Why can he prove himself to peter, to john but not to me or you?\n \n If god loves us all why does he not allow the bad to live until they accept him and kill the good immediately after they do? Why do we have a century limit to try to save ourselves?\n \n Does god know the future? If so how can any of us be anything but preprogramed no matter what we do? Or are you saying that god can't tell how we will turnout till we're made?\n \n Finally assuming that god is unable to create another intelligent being without a chunk of them turning to the darkside (which he somehow had nothing to do with though he created everything) why couldn't he simply keep the evil ones away from the good ones immediately? Why don't good people go to heaven right away and bad people go to hell right away?\n \n Do you believe that our actions make that choice and so imply that god is unable to know whose good and bad until a couple of decades of observation are done with?\n \n Or do you believe that god already knows and this is just some sort of interesting simulation?\n \n What I expect easyrider is that no being could act in such a contradictory manner, I expect that all of this is a synthesis of millenia of mysticism whose sole consistent element has been the denial of the real world and the destruction of man's mind.\n \n Dear god please:\n \nGet real.\n\n \n \nSecond, in answer to your challenge, what goes on in heaven is free will because WE CHOSE IT WHEN WE CHOSE CHRIST. \n\n Too bad christ didn't have a chat with adam and eve, would have saved a lot of trouble wouldn't it?",

My answer, simply put, is this: With free will there will be evil. I don't believe there is a god, so of course I don't believe a world without \"sin\" or \"evil\" or \"suffering\" is possible. It is, after all, a dog eat dog world. \n \n YOU are the one who is saying there is a better way in heaven. You deny that people will be \"robots\" in heaven, but you say they won't sin because they won't have the \"earthly, sinful nature.\" What a nice, thoughtful work of God.

How is God not a robot?\n \n For once, I agree with Freedom. His response (with the 1,283 questions) was pretty spot on. Of course, I wouldn't expect anyone to answer that many questions, but i just want you explain your contradictory statements.

   "You've had your explanations. Call it conditional free will if you want, but you all make your own free will choices all day long in a universe where God rules. However, when people, a city, or a nation gets too far out of line, then Judgment falls. That's what the Word of God teaches. \n \n Live in denial if you prefer. Spiritually challenged people cannot discern the truth on spiritual matters (1 Corinthians 2:14).\n \n If you prefer, make up your own thread on the topic. Then the three blind mice can wax eloquent all day long. This thread is for the Perfect Storm Prophecy, which is coming to pass right before your disbelieving eyes. \n \n Jesus is Lord.\n\n \n Easy What is prophecy? It's knowledge of future events given to prophets by God. In order for the prophet to glimpse future events those events have to happen in linear time, as a christian you will accept this concept since it is the form followed in the Bible. That means events spoken of in prophecy will happen and they will happen regardless of what we do. Prophecy is not guessing. It is not If we do A then B unless we do C then D. \n \n The other problem with prophecy is I can think of no more worthless way of communicating then by giving an ambiguos message to someone who will have almost no or absolutly no ability to convey that message or even comprehend it until after it has occured and even then the degree of doubt will render the knowledge practically useless for future occurances. Why couldn't God just make a cloud that floated around the world never dissapating that said \"Be Nice\" or show up every now and then like he used to. Prophecy is not the action of one entity really wanting the other to know something. \n \n Lastly you are so closed off to prophecy or anything from God that does not fit in your predetermined idea of what God wants that it is entirely possible that you will ignore what he is trying to tell you thinking it is coming from a false prophet. How would you know if just like the birth of Christianity it was time for the Jews to change it may be time for the Christians to change. Before you say it the change may need to happen before Jesus's second coming. His coming prior would effect man adversly. Just as the Jews saw nothing of Jesus in their books until after the fact the bible could contain the hidden messages, but since you do not permit anything but what you know, just like the Jews of 2000 years ago, you may force God to act prematurly and causing whatever he was planning to be incomplete just like when Jesus was here the first time. \n \n Face it your screwing up. That is why religion as you believe it makes no sense. Religion keeps man closer to God like a child who won't let go of mommy's leg and so never learns to walk on his own. If God wanted us to be so needy and incapable of being self sufficient he would be here doing things for us, but he isn't he threw us in the deep water and said learn to swim.",

Almost all the extraordinary men that lived under the heathen mythology were reputed to be the sons of some of their gods. It was not a new thing, at that time, to believe a man to have been celestially begotten; the intercourse of gods with women was then a matter of familiar opinion. Their Jupiter, according to their accounts, had cohabited with hundreds: the story, therefore, had nothing in it either new, wonderful, or obscene; it was conformable to the opinions that then prevailed among the people called Gentiles, or Mythologists, and it was those people only that believed it. The Jews who had kept strictly to the belief of one God, and no more, and who had always rejected the heathen mythology, never credited the story.\n\n \n I always thought that was a pretty interesting take on the situation.

   "The dumb ones are still waiting. The smart ones know he's already come, and his name is Jeshua/Jesus.\n \n Prophecies of the Messiah\n\n \n 1) Matthew 1:23 says that Jesus (the messiah) would be called Immanuel, which means \"God with us.\" Yet no one, not even his parents, call him Immanuel at any point in the bible.\n \n 2) The Messiah must be a physical descendant of David (Romans 1:3 & Acts 2:30). Yet, how could Jesus meet this requirement since his genealogies in Matthew 1 and Luke 3 show he descended from David through Joseph, who was not his natural father because of the Virgin Birth. Hence, this prophecy could not have been fulfilled.\n \n 3) Isaiah 7:16 seems to say that before Jesus had reached the age of maturity, both of the Jewish countries would be destroyed. Yet there is no mention of this prophecy being fulfilled in the New Testament with the coming of Jesus, hence this is another Messiah prophecy not fulfilled.\n \n 4) The gospels (especially Matthew 21:4 and John 12:14-15) claim that Jesus fulfills the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9. But the next few verses (Zechariah 9:10-13) show that the person referred to in this verse is a military king that would rule \"from sea to sea\". Since Jesus had neither an army nor a kingdom, he could not have fulfilled this prophecy.\n \n 5) Matthew (Matthew 2:17-18) quotes Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:15), claiming that it was a prophecy of King Herod's alleged slaughter of the children in and around Bethlehem after the birth of Jesus. But this passage refers to the Babylonian captivity, as is clear by reading the next two verses (Jeremiah 31:16-17), and, thus, has nothing to do with Herod's massacre.\n \n 6) John 19:33 says that during Jesus' crucifixion, the soldiers didn't break his legs because he was already dead. Verse John 19:36 claims that this fulfilled a prophecy: \"Not a bone of him shall be broken.\" But there is no such prophecy. It is sometimes said that the prophecy appears in Exodus 12:46, Numbers 9:12 & Psalm 34:20. This is not correct. Exodus 12:46 & Numbers 9:12 are not prophecies, they are commandments. The Israelites are told not to break the bones of the Passover lamb, and this is all it is about. And Psalm 34:20 seems to refer to righteous people in general (see verse Psalm 34:19, where a plural is used), not to make a prophecy about a specific person.\n \n 7) \"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.\" Hosea 11:1. Matthew (Matthew 2:15) claims that the flight of Jesus' family to Egypt is a fulfillment of this verse. But Hosea 11:1 is not a prophecy at all. It is a reference to the Hebrew exodus from Egypt and has nothing to do with Jesus. Matthew tries to hide this fact by quoting only the last part of the verse (\"Out of Egypt I have called my son\").\n \n 8) \"But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.\" Micah 5:2 The gospel of Matthew (Matthew 2:5-6) claims that Jesus' birth in Bethlehem fulfills this prophecy. But this is unlikely for two reasons.\n \n A) \"Bethlehem Ephratah\" in Micah 5:2 refers not to a town, but to a clan: the clan of Bethlehem, who was the son of Caleb's second wife, Ephrathah (1 Chronicles 2:18, 2:50-52 & 4:4).\n \n B) The prophecy (if that is what it is) does not refer to the Messiah, but rather to a military leader, as can be seen from Micah 5:6. This leader is supposed to defeat the Assyrians, which, of course, Jesus never did. It should also be noted that Matthew altered the text of Micah 5:2 by saying: \"And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judah\" rather than \"Bethlehem Ephratah\" as is said in Micah 5:2. He did this, intentionally no doubt, to make this verse appear to refer to the town of Bethlehem rather than the family clan.\n \n Conclusion: Jesus was not the Messiah, God Isn't real, and Christianity is a Scam to control the ignorant...

   "Here's another one of your blunders exposed:\n \n \n\n \n 8) \"But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.\" Micah 5:2 The gospel of Matthew (Matthew 2:5-6) claims that Jesus&#8217; birth in Bethlehem fulfills this prophecy. But this is unlikely for two reasons.\n \n A) \"Bethlehem Ephratah\" in Micah 5:2 refers not to a town, but to a clan: the clan of Bethlehem, who was the son of Caleb&#8217;s second wife, Ephrathah (1 Chronicles 2:18, 2:50-52 & 4:4).\n\n \n This is a tired, old canard. Bethlehem Ephretah (Ephrathah) was originally known as a place - Ephrath or Bethlehem (Genesis 35:16, Judges 12:8, 10, 17:7, 1 Samuel 17:12, etc.), and is identified as \"the City of David\" (Luke 2:4 &#8211; note that David&#8217;s (and Jesus&#8217;) ancestor Ruth was from the same city of Bethlehem (Ruth 1:19, 4:11). If Micah was referring to a clan of sorts you would probably have seen \"Bethlehem BEN Ephratah,\" or the &#8220;family / tribe of Ephratah,&#8221; which Micah does not say. \n \n \n B) The prophecy (if that is what it is) does not refer to the Messiah, but rather to a military leader, as can be seen from Micah 5:6. This leader is supposed to defeat the Assyrians, which, of course, Jesus never did. \n\n \n You always forget the 2nd Coming, when Jesus comes as the Messiah ben David - the Conquering King - and annihilates the stiff-necked crowd. \n \n You've got nothing, as usual. You didn't even give credit to the website you cut and pasted from. And maybe Freedom can get rid of his bias long enough to learn something.",

So you make reference to an obvious racist parody of Barack Obama.\n Now examine what you possibly could have meant. \n \n You asked if I was magic, in response to my statement that I was intelligent and learned, seeing that it was in question. \n Then you offer this up...clearly racist in nature, for which Rush Limbaugh was taken to task over it by mainstream media. \n Not only would I not watch any videos recommended by or starring Rush Limbaugh, him defending anything so remotely racist in nature and content, is beyond reprehensible and disgusting. \n \n So, you confirmed what I already knew, and I'm sure what most the board already knew. You're an avowed racist, with a chip on your shoulder, asking me if I'm magic. I don't believe in superstition or hocus pocus, pagan.\n So, let me tell you this....I have given you chance after chance to redeem yourself, but you continuously dig your grave deeper. Knowing that you would have the audacity to post a racist video of Barack Obama, and reference me, means that not only do you have no redeeming qualities as a human being, but that you are beneath me. Don't worry about me wondering anything about you or what you think....you couldn't help yourself from yourself. And you've been dissed by the gay black liberal. LOL.",

   "Ok. So you make reference to an obvious racist parody of Barack Obama.\n\n And it was worth it just to hear you call it racist.\n \n \nNow examine what you possibly could have meant. \n\n I meant your perverted little mind is on display, the way you talk you obviously see yourself as some kind of heroic figure standing up against the old master in an attebellum south. You make note of your proposed intelligence and learnedness as if that were a threat to the supposed oppressors.\n \n It was exactly that kind of absurdity that sparked the creation of the magic negro song. Which is designed to portray the foolishness of stereotyping black people. Rush has repeatedly noted with divining clarity how often people on the left go out of their way to note how 'intelligent and well spoken' obama is.\n \n They never did this for clinton or algore or any other white democrat. The article which sparked the magic nego song was pretty near explicit. The left is surprised when a black person is apparently intelligent or well spoken... because they are racist.\n \n and then you start to talk about how intelligent and learned you are, in the same post where you boast of how you are not easy to take down, and how your opponents bought into the idea of white privilege.\n \n Your own posts speak for themselves and you have brought yourself down. You are a racist and if it seems like I am just sitting back enjoying the spectacle of your behavior... it's because I am; I already made a serious effort to bring your racism to your attention and you having nothing to say put me on ignore (or so you said).\n \n What privilege have you bought into that excuses you from your racism? How special do you feel about your supposed intelligence and education?\n \n \nSo, you confirmed what I already knew, and I'm sure what most the board already knew. You're an avowed racist, with a chip on your shoulder\n\n Do you expect anything but laughing? You shouldn't but I'll give you something anyway.\n \n You're right. I have a chip on my shoulder, you can't imagine the enmity I feel for people like you. Your kind have sought for millennia to destroy everything that is good in this world and no one has come forth to stop you until the last precious 234 years. You were beaten for the first time in a long time in 1783, you were beaten again in 1865 and 1945, but for every advance there has been a setback and now the combined will and labour of uncounted heroes of freedom threaten to mean nothing because your type have spread the delusion that humanity is to be thought of as groups and not individuals. Your incessant categorization, condemnation; you ride the emotion of past injustices to create new ones. Your hypocrisy precludes you from ever knowing why injustices even exist and your soul may not be able to take the shock that they stem from your own mindless ignorance and unthinking emotion.\n \n If you were a race and your race caused you to think as you are I would hate that race, but there is only one human race and you are just a man. Face the truth, all that is evil in man exists in his mind, and there is no collective mind. All that is evil in our race exists in the minds of single men as beliefs that one must accept volitionally, one at a time. It is not your genes I hate it is the fallacies that corrupt you... the fallacies you have let corrupt you.\n \n \nSo, let me tell you this....I have given you chance after chance to redeem yourself, but you continuously dig your grave deeper.\n\n ysuir masta you certainly have taken me off ignore to check on my progress every once in a while you surely have!\n \n \nKnowing that you would have the audacity to post a racist video of Barack Obama, and reference me, means that not only do you have no redeeming qualities as a human being, but that you are beneath me.\n\n I can't say the same for you. You are the ideal object of contempt not beneath it as one might be inclined to think on first impressions.\n \n \nDon't worry about me wondering anything about you or what you think....you couldn't help yourself from yourself. \n\n I am far more worried about how to destroy all of you.\n \n \nAnd you've been dissed by the gay black liberal.

   "Jesus the Light\n \n 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4 In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.\n 6 There was a man sent from God whose name was John. 7 He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. 8 He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.\n 9 The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. - John chapter 1\n \n Now, from Isaiah chapter 9:\n \n 1 Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those who were in distress. In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the nations, by the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan-\n 2 The people walking in darkness \n have seen a great light; \n on those living in the land of deep darkness \n a light has dawned. \n 3 You have enlarged the nation \n and increased their joy; \n they rejoice before you \n as people rejoice at the harvest, \n as warriors rejoice \n when dividing the plunder. \n 4 For as in the day of Midian's defeat, \n you have shattered \n the yoke that burdens them, \n the bar across their shoulders, \n the rod of their oppressor. \n 5 Every warrior's boot used in battle \n and every garment rolled in blood \n will be destined for burning, \n will be fuel for the fire. \n 6 For to us a child is born, \n to us a son is given, \n and the government will be on his shoulders. \n And he will be called \n Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, \n Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. \n 7 Of the greatness of his government and peace \n there will be no end. \n He will reign on David's throne \n and over his kingdom, \n establishing and upholding it \n with justice and righteousness \n from that time on and forever. \n The zeal of the LORD Almighty \n will accomplish this.",

You ignore the hundred times I have admitted ignorance or ceded a point because apparently that only 'counts' if you first asserted you did know it before you finally admitted that you didn't.

   "THE COMING PERFECT STORM\n \"For those of you who have followed this ministry, you have heard me say more than once during the past eight years that from 2009 or 2010, things will become very difficult......Different areas of the United States will experience different severities. Some will experience more economic elements, others more geo-physical elements; some will experience all elements.\n \n WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE COMING? What are some of the things/consequences that will come? In time, water will be more expensive than oil, and cities will evacuate thousands because there is not enough water to meet their needs. (As Amos 4:7 says, \"I made it rain on one city, I withheld rain from another city.\") Earthquakes will strike not only coastal areas but devastate the Midwest as well. Israel will bomb Iran, and anti-Semitism will escalate as fuel costs soar. A dirty bomb will explode in a coastal city. There will be thunderstorms with huge hail, 24 inches of rain in 24 hours, three feet of snow in six hours, record-setting tornadoes with winds of more than 350 miles per hour and tornadoes in unusual places. There will be an unexpected blight that will hit various hybrid seed crops and weaken the yield. In addition, drought and devastation from storms will dramatically cut into various harvests and the national food storage will deplete.\"\n \n In the following \"Updated\" video (link below), Jackson provides more insight on future events, including a new, treacherous Russian leader whom will conspire with Muslims to control the Black Sea area, etc. He also prophesies concerning more corruption on Wall Street and Congress, the kidnapping of a U.S. Congressman or Senator, a description of what will happen in a U.S. city hit by a dirty bomb, property taxes on the Church, and a rising Islamic influence in Mexico that will effect the U.S.\n\n We made through 2009 and 2010 and none of those things has happened.",
