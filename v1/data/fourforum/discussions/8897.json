   "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A substantial percentage of men who have homosexual sex still consider themselves \"straight,\" a survey of New York City men suggests.\n \n The findings imply that doctors should not rely on a man's self-described sexual orientation in assessing his risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, researchers report in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n \n Instead, they should ask patients specific questions about their sexual behavior, according to the researchers, led by Dr. Preeti Pathela of the New York City health department.\n \n The findings are based on a 2003 health department survey that included 4,193 men age 18 and up. Respondents were asked about their sexual behavior and their sexual orientation. \n \n \n Almost 4 percent said they were homosexual, while 91 percent described themselves as \"straight.\" The rest said they were bisexual, \"unsure,\" or declined to answer.\n \n But of men who considered themselves heterosexual, nearly 10 percent had had sex with a man, but no woman, in the past year, Pathela's team found. And of the 337 survey respondents who'd had sex with another man, almost 73 percent identified themselves as straight.\n \n [NOTE:Approximately 70% of straight-identified men who have sex with men reported being married, which was substantially more than any other identity-behavior group: 54% of straight-identified men who have sex with women and only 0.2% of gay-identified men who have sex with men reported being married. ]\n \n Cultural norms may have played a significant role in the discrepancy, according to the researchers. Foreign-born men, who make up a large proportion of New York City men, were more likely than their U.S.-born counterparts to call themselves heterosexual despite having sex with other men.\n \n Men raised in cultures less accepting of homosexuality may be \"reluctant\" to identify themselves as such, Pathela's team notes, or they may have a narrow definition of what constitutes homosexuality.\n \n In general, self-described heterosexuals, whether they had sex with men or not, had fewer sexual partners than men who said they were homosexual. However, self-described straight men who had sex with other men were less likely than gay men to have had an HIV test recently or to use condoms. \n \n This pattern is \"troubling,\" according to the researchers, and it highlights the need to target STD prevention messages beyond men who call themselves homosexual.\n \n \"It is of utmost importance for providers to take a sexual history that ascertains the sex of (the) partner or partners,\" Pathela's team writes. \"Given our data, asking about a patient's sexual identity will not adequately assess his risk.\"\n \n SOURCE: Annals of Internal Medicine, September 19, 2006.",

Demonizing homosexuals with inaccurate bullsh!t.\n \n I know I embrace psychological research because it cuts through a lot of the stupid XXXX that the anti-gay side puts out.\n Being gay is not a choice.\n Gays are just like straights, with the exception of the gender of who we are attracted to.\n \n THAT is what was embraced.\n \n But as for \"Classifications\"?\n Homosexuality is a word originating in 1869 by Karl-Maria Kertbeny.\n Bisexuality probably has some significant roots from Kinsey's concepts.\n But the CLASSIFICATION ITSELF does not lend credibility.\n \n If you put a different name on something, it doesn't make it right.\n Changing \"rapes kids\" to \"pedophilia\" or \"NAMBLA\" does not make it legitimate.\n Trying to change \"pedophilia\" to a spectrum of \"age attractions\" (from people who are attracted to very young to people who are attracted to very old), complete with classifications, does not lend credence to pedophilia.\n \n The \"classification\" doesn't lead anybody away from thinking it's wrong.\n The FACTS do that.\n \n \n \nIt changed the idea of it being wrong to the idea of it being a different catagory.\n\n So let's say we have \"age attraction\" discrimination.\n Let's classify people along a spectrum from pedophilia, to attraction to people of their own age, to attraction to people who are much older.\n Does that make \"pedophilia\" any more right?\n \n There is a spectrum of sexual attraction. Acknowledging that is based on acknowledging facts.\n \n \n \n And it's a strategy that worked, in large part given the fact that gay behavior has so much more legitimacy today than it used to.\n\n That's rather flawed logic.\n Trying to validate the mechanism based on observing the continuation of the claimed effect is not logic.\n \n I could claim that me sleeping at night causes the sun to rise in the morning.

Cultures that are more open abotu sexuality tend to be much more peacefull and have almost no rape.\n \n regarding the argument, i dont think that the gay rights movment used those words to promote legetimacy, they changed the meaning of those words by asserting their own legeteimacy. Before, a 'homosexual' was a person with a mental condition. I can sympatize with and appreceate the reaction of the people in the gay rights movement who asserted that this 'condition' was just a perfectly normal fact about some people.

Although this study took place in Noo Yoark Sittee and its environs, I suspect that similar behavior is seen nationwide. Sexual behavior and its sequelae are behaviors, not mindsets or ideologies and should be addressed as such.\n\n I think there are a variety of issues behind the disjoint.\n 1) Definitions.

With women?\"\n ...or something similar.\n 2) Self-reflection honesty. Sometimes, people refuse to classify themselves as what they are. The link between \"latent homosexuality\" and \"homophobia\" is one example of that disjoint.\n 3) Attraction, vs sexual release. I sometimes masturbate. Most people do. That doesn't mean I am attracted to my hand. I wouldn't classify my sexual orientation as having any inclusion with my hand.\n Likewise, it's possible that some of these guys are having sex with other guys as an easy sexual release. \n \n \n \nTo godisdead, you should not be surprised that doctors ask about such things in such a cloddy way.

And how often their \"successes\" turn around and fail.\n \n Spitzer has a study which is often quoted by the ex-gay crowd. The participants of his study were HAND-PICKED and given to him BY THE EX-GAY GROUPS.\n That's like asking Proctor and Gamble if they can show you people who have used their product. They are going to give you their \"success\" stories. Not their failures.\n And since the ex-gay groups have LESS accountability than medical products with liability, ...\n \n Anyways, with Spitzer's study, a HUGE percentage of the \"successes\" still fantasized about having sex with people of the same gender during masturbation.\n Some \"cure\", eh?\n Just repression.\n But they continue to \"advertise\" that they can CHANGE a person from gay to straight.\n \n And based on that, is it any wonder that some people think they can change themselves if they just live the straight life?",
