   "The French are up in arms right now about the Bolkenstein directive. The directive allows EU nationals to offer services in any EU country while only being bound by the laws and taxes of their own home country.\n \n The French are afraid that this will create an influx of cheap labour from Eastern European countries and that this in turn will spell out higher unemployment for native French workers.\n \n Right now the resistance is so great that it could jeopardise a positive result in the upcoming referendum on the EU constitution.\n \n Now while I do think that the arguments by the French nay-sayers have some merit, somehow they don't realise that every other EU country will have the same problem.\n \n Frankly I'm getting a bit tired of the French. They're always bitching and whining about everything, but they always want to have the last word.\n It wouldn't be so bad if they actually paid their dues for once in a while. Right now they pay 4 times less in EU contributions than for example my country, the Netherlands, while at the same time having 4 times more to say in EU matters.\n \n Like the saying goes: pay up or shut up.",

   "I agree that the french are a handfull when it comes to EU. But I do understand the french concerns generated by the proposal of the Bolkenstein directive. The idea that the laws, taxes and regulations of the origin country the service provider hais from should apply even in other EU-member states they operate in is a bad idea. I can certainly understand the idea behind the directive (promote trade in services throughout EU), but I fear that it will merely become a vehicle for further EU supra-national legislation. \n \n I actually don`t fear the implications the directive could come to have on the situation on the labour market. Most of our rules and regulations on the labour markets are upheld through contracts between empoyers and labour unions. We don`t even have minimum wage laws. Recent court rulings and events have shown that foreign companies operating in Sweden will quickly conform to swedish collective contracts and adhere to the standards specified or face retaliation from a unified labour movement so severe that they are shut down. However, most EU countries don`t have this \"tradition\". Laws and regulations are the most common way to ensure decent wages, health- and safety measures, enviromental standards and consumer protection in europe at the moment. This could mean that if the Bolkenstein directive would become law, these standards will quickly become eroded as the possibility for companies to register wherever the laws and regulations are the most lax. This could start a race towards \"the bottom\" that would end with virtually no protection for employees and consumers at all. However, I am quite certain this will never come to pass.\n \n Instead, I think that the initial reaction would be reduced standards. But very quickly, national politicians throughout europe will start to capitalize on the anger and fear this reduction will cause. This in turn will create a political will to equalise standards throughout the whole EU, depriving national parliaments the ability to decide these standards for themselves. Instead of merely encouraging trade, the directive will eventually encourage equalisation. And I`m not so sure that every EU member would benefit from having their labour laws and standards equalised with the German and French. Because, let`s face it, these are the big players. The new entrant EU members (those who would lose out the most from equalisation) will not be able to withstand thepolitical clout wielded by the old members. At first apperance, the Bolkenstein directive looks like it would encourage liberalisation, flexibility and competativity in the EU service sector. But when examined more closely, it looks more like an attempt to reduce competition from the new entrant countries at the expense of their quick economic growth.\n \n But of course the french politicans allready tries to build a base for their agenda. By accusing the directive of threatening french jobs, it will be a pick-nick to eventually use the directive as an argument for equalisation.",

   "While my inability to read French limits my ability to google actual statistics on France, what I do read states France and most other mature EU nations are experiencing a problem of illegal immigration due to unemployment and unstable political conditions in other, less developed nations. \n\n \n Ah, yes. Illegal immigration is considered a problem in a few EU member states. The most serious problem is however trafficking of women and children, mainly for illegal purposes (such as the sex industry). \n \n QUOTE=georged]While Sweden has abnormal organized labor dominance, that's not the case in other EU nations.[/QUOTE]\n \n Very true. And France is an example of a country with very weak labour organisation.\n \n QUOTE=georged]With agreement to use country of origin legislation regarding all or most regulation of commerce, the trend will obviously be incorporation in those countries having lesser compliance requirements, abandoning capital development in mature nations.

Or is it time to bite the bullet and integrate all EU members with comparable commerce legislation to stabilize proprietary social services tax bases in individual EU nations?[/QUOTE]\n \n I don`t think that the medium will be achieved. That would be far to sensible ;). Instread, I`m quite certain that the larger and more powerful members will trump through their own laws and regulations. While this could be used by the German government as an excuse to reform their labour markets, I think Germany needs to do it on their own terms, rather than trying to strike deals with other members. The french interest organisations will fight to the death to maintain their special perks. Italy will simply ignore any legislation that contradicts their own interests (as they always do). The nordic countries will replace laws with union contracts (and render equalisation obsolete) and if the labour unions dominance is threatened, it will result in even lower aproval ratings for EU membership (and I`m not sure how much more it will take before the national politicians can`t ignore the anti-EU sentiments any longer). The new entrant countries will be forced into an equalisation process they can`t afford at the moment, but they will bite the bullet as they desperatly needs to join the Euro as soon as possible. It will never work.\n \n Another real problem with the plausible equalisation development is that it would be to quick. There is allready an equalisation process in most areas (including enviromental-, labour and consumer legislation) throughout the EU area, but this process is slow moving. And it is based on minimum levels that makes it possible to take small steps instead of overhauling the whole system in one fell swope.",

   "Why I will say 'no' to the European constitution\n \n 1) This is not a constitution. A constitution is a concise document laying down the groundwork for a nation. Laws are then adopted to further clarify what is meant by the articles in the constitution. That way, the constitution can withstand the test of time because it doesn't need to be changed every other year or so, and thus provide a sense of stability. Nevertheless, the European 'constitution' is fatter than Michael Moore in a tub of lard, with over 300 pages.\n 2) I have a distrust against any constitution which doesn't start with 'We, the people' or something to that end. The European 'constitution' sounds like a friggin' parking permit:\n \n DRAWING INSPIRATION from the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe, from which have developed the universal values of the inviolable and inalienable rights of the human person, freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law,\n \n BELIEVING that Europe, reunited after bitter experiences, intends to continue along the path of civilisation, progress and prosperity, for the good of all its inhabitants, including the weakest and most deprived; that it wishes to remain a continent open to culture, learning and social progress; and that it wishes to deepen the democratic and transparent nature of its public life, and to strive for peace, justice and solidarity throughout the world,\n \n CONVINCED that, while remaining proud of their own national identities and history, the peoples of Europe are determined to transcend their former divisions and, united ever more closely, to forge a common destiny,\n \n CONVINCED that, thus 'United in diversity', Europe offers them the best chance of pursuing, with due regard for the rights of each individual and in awareness of their responsibilities towards future generations and the Earth, the great venture which makes of it a special area of human hope,\n \n DETERMINED to continue the work accomplished within the framework of the Treaties establishing the European Communities and the Treaty on European Union, by ensuring the continuity of the Community acquis,\n \n GRATEFUL to the members of the European Convention for having prepared the draft of this Constitution on behalf of the citizens and States of Europe,\n \n OK, a rather lengthy parking permit. Incidentally, there used to be something in there about the Judeo-Christian inheritance of Europe, which is a hell of a lot bigger than the humanist one, but this was considered to be unsavoury.\n 3) This constitution will effectively abolish the sovereign Dutch nation. Bigger EU nations will get more voting powers, and the endowment of the European Parliament with extra powers will have a similar eroding effect on our independence.\n Already, laws are being adopted in the Netherlands which would never have made it if not for the EU. Recently, a law proposal was drafted which reverses the burden of proof in cases of sexual harassment. (Which will, incidentally, lead to employers hiring fewer women in order to avoid being falsely accused, and/or putting up cameras everywhere. Thank you, EU, for curbing our civil rights!)\n 4) We will have to abolish most of our social welfare. The European constitution will make sure that the Netherlands won't be able to regulate their own immigration policy any longer. As a result, many immigrants will be tempted to travel here, for our welfare system is one of the most luxurious in Europe. There will be no other way of preventing an influx of fortune seekers other than curbing welfare for everyone - including the ones who have paid premiums for years. While I am not exactly a proponent of the current rate of spending on welfare in the Netherlands, the European constitution will force us to do away with nearly all of it.\n \n Also, I'm really sick of the euro because the EMU is full of frauds, I detest the arrogant attitude of France and Germany, and have become a lot less enthusiastic about Turkish admission to the EU after the way they behaved on the EU Summit in the Netherlands last year (which was bullyish and extremely arrogant). Oh, and The Economist has quite a few reasons, too.\n \n Incidentally, Elsevier News Weekly has also adopted the 'no stance' in its latest issue.\n \n If anyone knows of a decent 'Vote No' banner, I'll be glad to put it up.\n\n \n Gamehuis, what do you think of this guy's post?\n his comment about the preamble is interesting but it does draw my attention to ask when was Europe actually ever \"united before bitter experiences\" beyond being conquered by hitler or napoleon?

(German and French ... i mean Corsican)\n\n I agree with him up to a certain point. The Eu is unfortunately a reality, so the 'constitution' is necessary to streamline all the agreements that make up the EU.\n But to call it a real constitution is IMO folly. I for one don't want to see my country's sovereignty being eroded and our domestic policies being dictated by France and Germany.\n And the Euro was one of the biggest scams in the history of Europe. The politicians wanted to have the highest possible price for the Euro so that their salaries which were previously being paid out in devalutating national currencies would now skyrocket.\n In fact, the introduction of the Euro in Holland was actually unconstitutional because it didn't pass through the First Chamber (Dutch Senate), but none of the politicians wanted to touch that subject with a ten foot pole.\n \n Europe will IMO never be truly united because of the vast cultural and linguistic differences between the member states.\n But after WWI and WWII, which basically wasted all of Europes major cities and decimated the population, I think the European mindset was already such that we would never again let conflict get a hold of us (that's why we're so damn leftist).
