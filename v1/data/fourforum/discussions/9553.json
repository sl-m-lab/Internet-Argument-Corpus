   "This from rawstory:\n \n Bush administration delays rollout of intel showing Iran's help to Iraqi militias\n Michael Roston\n Published: Friday February 9, 2007\n After the damage to its reputation caused by using faulty intelligence to justify the invasion in Iraq, the Bush administration has been more cautious about publicly presenting evidence of Iran's assistance to Iraqi militias, according to a report in the National Journal today.\n \n Reporter and blogger Laura Rozen reports that twice in the past month, the Bush administration has delayed presentation of PowerPoint slides making the case that Iran is assisting Shi'a militias in Iraq's simmering sectarian conflict. While US officials in Baghdad are ready to present the slides, the White House is wary that \"the press will scrutinize the information intensely, that the intelligence 'dots' that the administration has assembled about Iran in Iraq can be connected multiple ways.\"\n \n Rozen explains that while the White House sees \"damning\" evidence of Iran's engagement with the Shi'a side of Iraq's hostilities, \"the intelligence community is quietly indicating that the case purporting to prove Iran's involvement in Iraq is murkier and less decisive than the thrust of recent administration statements suggests.\"\n \n The National Journal also indicates that there is more oversight coming on the part of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence with regard to the intelligence community's Iran analysis. But an anonymous administration official still insisted to Rozen that the White House has good evidence of its claims about Iran's activities in Iraq.\n \n \"The physical evidence we have -- weapons, ammunition, explosives -- have packaging material. When you look at it, it will be obvious ... that the stuff came from Iran,\" he tells her.\n \n However, Rozen adds, \"But that evidence, the official conceded, doesn't tell exactly why it was sent, or who sent it.\" The administration is therefore likely to try to prove that the materiel is the same as what has been used by Iran-supplied Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n \n But it may not matter according to one former intelligence officer that Rozen quotes.\n \n \"None of this hinges [on the Iran dossier]. We are not going to call this off if we can't prove that Iran is furnishing munitions to Iraqi groups,\" he says.\n \n http://www.rawstory.com/news/2007/Iran_intel_delayed_0209.html",

Bush and co took that intel, put it in front of congress and told them it was from the penagon, and they voted to go to war based on it. He classified the fact that it came from a unit in the pentagon HE had set up specifically to bolster the case for war. \n \n The people that we \"liberated\" are being slaughtered today because the worthless jacakasses in the Bush administration did not form a realistic view of what was likely to happen after the invasion. They were so convicned fo the superiority of the American culture and American idealism that they did not form any contingency plan for what would happen if the Iraqi people did not all trip over themselves trying to be the new Vermont.\n \n Right now, the BS intel that the Bush administration managed to push as legitimate and their conceited view of US superiority have cost over half a million Iraqi lives and several thousand american lives, as well as tens of thousands of injured americans and a trillion US tax dollars.",

It is what was supposed to happen when we went to war. We took the fight to the enemy. Iraq has been difficult, but it has focused the Qaeda fools. They are not here though they try. It is an easier target. Iraq has other strategic concerns as well. \n \n You alien and mole men comment is simply stupid. There is no logical parallel as they do not exist. Al Qaeda most certainly does. They do not care who is in office. They have been against the US long before bush. They attacked the US under Clinton too (among others) in case you forget.\n \n As for the lingering scares that someone else commented on, well, we live in different times. Do you think that those scares would not be far more real issues had we not gone to war? Do not be so naive as to think that they only want to attack us because we are in IRAQ. They dislike us. We are the infidel. Look at the radical islamic rhetoric. Islam came into being by conquering. It is not so much of a religious tenent, as we understand it in the western since, as it is a socio-political power grab. They are going after all who are not muslim. \n \n Terrorist attacks are not limited to the US or do you not remember those in India, China, Indonesia, Germany, france, Austria, Britain, Russia, Japan, Egypt, Brazil, Venezuela, etc. over the last 15 years? It is time to grow up and realize we are at war and living in a different world than we did during WWII. The enemy no longer puts on uniforms to fight another military. Instead, they look like us and bomb our women and children in the malls, in markets, in bus terminals, wherever people gather.\n \n You have forgotten the nature of TERRORISM is to strike TERROR, fear, into the heart of a populace. Fear has one purpose and one purpose only when inflicted by someone. That purpose is to control you. When you give into the fear then they have already won.\n \n I charge us all here, do not denigrate our troops. If you don't like bush, fine. If you don't like clinton, fine. But understand the nature of our world today and if you don't like what is going on to stop it then quit belly aching and propose an alternative and back it up with analysis and evidence.\n \n If you want to argue that Bush lied, quit posting that he lied and then show things that he said that later proved to not be true. To prove a lie, logically, you have to show intent. That is difficult to show.

Although I believe that it is possible to die with honour in conflict, this isn't in the same league. The people in the towers were victims. They weren't involved in combat, they didn't spend thier lives for some noble end (with the exception of the emergency services, who most certainly displayed heroism and valour), they were murdered, and there's nothing honourable about murder.\n \n \nThere has not been a terror attack on our soil in all this time.\n\n \n How many were there before 9/11? I haven't yet seen convincing evidence that Al Queda planned multiple attacks. \n \n \nDo you think that those scares would not be far more real issues had we not gone to war? \n\n \n I think going to war perfectly played into the hands of those extreemists looking for a method to stir up anti-US sentiment.

The fact they are more indiscriminant than an ordered army merely means they are not bound by a similar military code as us. Terrorism has a bad record of causing people to cow down in fear. 30 years of IRA bombs merely made people in the UK more determined.

   "Dulce et decorum est, pro patria mori? I'm with Owen in this instance. Although I believe that it is possible to die with honour in conflict, this isn't in the same league. The people in the towers were victims. They weren't involved in combat, they didn't spend thier lives for some noble end (with the exception of the emergency services, who most certainly displayed heroism and valour), they were murdered, and there's nothing honourable about murder.\nNever talked about 9/11. I am speaking of those heros currently in combat.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nHow many were there before 9/11? I haven't yet seen convincing evidence that Al Queda planned multiple attacks. )\n At least the bombing of the world trade center. You can check other embassy bombings etc. if you need further info.\n \n \n \n \nI think going to war perfectly played into the hands of those extreemists looking for a method to stir up anti-US sentiment. Whether you like it or not the shadow of the crusades hangs over this war.)\n We too easily forget that ISLAM (not sects but islam itself) was spread strictly by the sword. That is what prompted the crusades. Until the islamic army took over jerusalem, there was no need to free it. Islamists did not just grow up there and slowly take over the territory. They took it by force. That is Islams history, its fatherhood if you will. Current sects that do advocate such things are secular humanists by and large.\n \n The crusades were a response. They were not the problem. The original conquerors were the islamic armies.\n \n \n \n \nSects of Islam... Much like some of the more zealous (and thankfully now largely extinct) sects of Christianity)\n\n \n See above\n \n \n \n \nBut that's not a reason to attack all muslims, or arabs.....)\n\n \n We have not attacked saudi arabia, bahrain, yemen, qatar, pakistan, parts of india, egypt, etc. Your argument assumes facts not in evidence and also in error. We are not attacking all muslims. We are attacking those with whom we war. We did not attack iraq for its muslim content. We attacked Iraq because of its horrifyingly brutal leader and His support of terrorism for his own gain. He may not have had WMD but he certainly was working on getting it. There is more than enough documentary evidence to support that. He had busses whose sole purpose was biological warfare. He maintained the ability to reconstitute his programs even after destroying the inventory. That is plenty of reason. No one lied about that.\n \n \n \n \nActually terrorism uses violence to achieve some end. The fact they are more indiscriminant than an ordered army merely means they are not bound by a similar military code as us. Terrorism has a bad record of causing people to cow down in fear. 30 years of IRA bombs merely made people in the UK more determined. A solitary attack just gets people angry, particulary with the (no offense) gung-ho attitude displayed by many Americans. It's actually a good way to get people to react without thinking......)\n\n They do not just use violence but violence that is intended to strike fear into the populace. The phrase by the way is not \"cow down\" but rather \"kowtow\" from the chinese koutou meanning to bow down in aquiessence.\n \n The problem is that these are not solitary attacks. You need to do an easy search on terrorist attacks. such as:\n Yemen 1992\n Somalia 1993\n Operation Bojinka\n Saudi Arabia 1995-96\n 1998 U.S. embassy bombings\n 1999 and 2000 attacks\n \n USS Cole after it was bombedIn December 1999 and into 2000, al-Qaeda planned attacks against U.S. and Israeli tourists visiting Jordan for millennial celebrations; however, Jordanian authorities thwarted the planned attacks and put 28 suspects on trial. Part of this plot included the planned bombing of the Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California, but this plot was foiled when bomber Ahmed Ressam was caught at the US-Canadian border with explosives in the trunk of his car. Al-Qaeda also planned to attack the USS The Sullivans on January 3, 2000, but the effort failed due to too much weight being put on the small boat meant to bomb the ship.\n \n Despite the setback with the USS The Sullivans, al-Qaeda succeeded in bombing a U.S. warship in October 2000 with the USS Cole bombing. German police foiled a plot to destroy a cathedral in Strasbourg, France in December 2000. See: Strasbourg cathedral bombing plot\n \n and so on. You can look in wikipedia or any other source you like.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIf that's the case, then the terrorists have already beaten you. America is striking out at anyone to make itself feel safe. You only do that if you're scared....)\n\n \n Hardly. America is not striking out at anyone. They have a careful, planned and coordinated attack. If you think we are striking at anyone, you should check again. You should also note the some 40 countries that are part of the coalition in afghan and iraq. Your bend and lien on this is all too obvious. You are spouting democrat talking points and not looking objectively at the evidence.

We never should have even given them a chance at that. Anyone who understands democracy knows that it takes a very long time to work, a population that has the virtues, the insitutions for it to run properly and a lack of massive secreterian violence. Look at South Korea. It took them 50 years to get it right. Japan's STILL not a true democracy. We should have followed the Israeli's model of decipating the gov't, and installing a Murbark like figure. We'd be out there in a year. Tops. I don't care about Iraqis.

As I say, I only have the word of the CIA via MI5 and the media that Al Queda planned and executed all these attacks. I remain skeptical\n \n \nWe too easily forget that ISLAM (not sects but islam itself) was spread strictly by the sword. That is what prompted the crusades.

That is Islams history, its fatherhood if you will. Current sects that do advocate such things are secular humanists by and large.\n\n \n Although an Islamic army did indeed capture Jerusalem in 638, the Muslims were perfectly happy to allow Jews and Christians to remain in the area, as long as they paid taxes. Hardly the actions of a religion fixated on killing. The first crusade didn't happen until 1099, so it was hardly a reprisal, and when they did capture Jerusalem they slaughtered the Muslim and Jewish inhabitants.\n \n (info from wikipedia here)\n \n \nThe crusades were a response. They were not the problem. The original conquerors were the islamic armies.\n\n \n And before them it was the Romans, and before them it was the Babylonians, and before them it was the Israelites, and before them it was probably which ever tribe the Israelites took it from. How far back are you going? On that argument all the Abrahamic religions are religions of the sword, and one is no better than the others.\n \n \nWe are not attacking all muslims.\n\n \n You don't target all muslims, yet all your targets are muslims. I can certainly appreciate where thier feeling of victimization comes from. \n \n \nWe attacked Iraq because of its horrifyingly brutal leader and His support of terrorism for his own gain\n\n \n Since when did anyone make the USA world police? I personally agree that Hussein was not the worlds nicest guy, in fact he was a rather nasty piece of work, but given that all the BBC correspondants are contrasting the stability (and relative tranquility) of Iraq pre-war to now, I would argue with your description brutal. And I'm sorry, but there's too much waffle from both your and my government for them to convince me that Hussein had anything to do with Al Queda. \n \n \nHe may not have had WMD but he certainly was working on getting it.\n\n \n Given the global black market avaliability of nuclear and biological weapons is apparently high, it would hardly seem that difficult to develop them. Also, in these days of MAD, surely every nation will want to play hardball.\n \n \nThat is plenty of reason.\n\n \n So 'We don't like you, or what you might do in the future' is enough reason to invade nowadays. True it's kinda similar to historical precedent, but I thought/hoped we were more civillised these days.\n \n \nThe phrase by the way is not \"cow down\" but rather \"kowtow\" from the chinese koutou meanning to bow down in aquiessence.\n\n \n Interesting factoid emoticon_xgood I was actually basing mine on 'to cower down in fear'\n \n Several of those you list seem to be attacks on military, or military style areas. Embassies always have soldiers guarding them, and US Navy ships are military targets. I'm not justifying thier actions, but so far they seem like a global version of the old IRA. Admittedly an attack on LAX is indiscriminant.\n \n \nHardly. America is not striking out at anyone. They have a careful, planned and coordinated attack. \n\n \n Could have fooled me. The impression that the US has managed to generate is that they are underprepared, undersupplied and underinformed. I'll certainly agree that the invasion plans of both Iraq and Afghanistan were put together well, and were well carried out. Plans for the occupation seem to be rather botched. A careful and planned attack strategy would have an allowance for that as well. Iraq did seem a bit ad hoc.\n \n \nYou should also note the some 40 countries that are part of the coalition in afghan and iraq. \n\n \n I know, we're one of them....\n \n \nYour bend and lien on this is all too obvious. You are spouting democrat talking points and not looking objectively at the evidence\n\n \n Tell me what my obvious bend is then? Do I believe that we should pull the troops out or not? Talking about me spouting democrat points doesn't mean much to me. I'm Conservative (Center-Right in the UK) though I don't know where that falls on the American scales. The evidence I look at is ever rising death tolls, war raging over 2 countries, the seemingly high probability of war in a thrid country, the fact that subsequent attacks have occured (twice in the UK alone), that muslims in the UK feel marginalised and threatened thus perpetuating the problem so on and so forth. On these grounds I feel justified in accusing Bush of not having a stable plan prior to acting, and in acting wrongly.\n \n \nI agree with you on this point. Thank you.\n\n \n No prob",

   "Wasn't it Winston Churchill that opined that the best argument against democracy as a form of government is a 5 minute conversation with your average voter?? \n\n Yep, that was him.\n \n \nI have been having some conversations recently with an old frined in the ME. He argues that a dictatorship may be a superior form of government. A dictator typically has to fight his way to the top and then maintain power on his own. This requires a tough, smart individual. If you look at recent history, it seems that his idea does have some merits. While there have certainly been plenty of evil dictators, you would be hard pressed to find a STUPID dictator in the last century.\n\n Well in a sense we're all stupid because we're human, but dictators are usually a bit smarter than the rest of us, that's how they got on the top of the food chain.\n Unfortunately for dictators they always seem to reach a point where they start believing their own BS and start screwing up bigtime.\n I think of Mugabe who after being in power for 20 years decided to slowly selfdestruct by implementing idiotic military and economic policies.\n Or how about that Hitler? I guess he thought that opening up a second front against Russia was a sound tactical move.\n \n \n10 years ago it would have been much easier to debate this with him. Today, looking at the leadership of the US, and the apparent idiocy of the voting public, I am having trouble debating the point. In our current system, you seem to have the voters dictating foreign policy, economic policy, military policy, and since the average voter does not seem to know ANYTHING about ANY of those, having them run the show is starting to look like a bad idea.\n\n An American comdedian named George Carlin did a stand-up piece about this very issue. \n What it comes down to is that you really can't complain about the politicians because they are elected by and come from American families. If you have a selfish and ignorant population, you get selfish and ignorant politicians.\n Garbage in, garbage out.\n \n Please note that this applies to most countries around the world not just the US. Hell, over here in Holland the Islamophobe party got quite some seats in the last election, all because baby Bush scared some sheep with his TerrorTalk(t/m).",

   "That depends. Those who go into gov't leadership usually aren't the cream of the crop. O ne reason we have huge gov't is because those who favor small tend to be doing other things. As for the idiocy of the public, that falls partly on the failure of the Media to deal with the important issues as well as the fact that political leadership doesn't want a informed voting public. If the public knew what kind of **** was going on they'd vote most or all of them out of office. The American gov't and media are partially designed to keep voters dumb and in the dark. So it's not necessarily a failure of democracy but a delibate attempt by those in power to stay in power.So it's not necessarily a failure of democracy but a delibate attempt by those in power to stay in power.\n\n But isn't it true that power corrupts?

   "You need to reread your history. Christianity spread long before the roman empire became christian.\n\n \n You're ignoring what's important here. Various sects of Christanity were butchered by the RCC as it gained power.\n \n \nAnd christianity was not spread by the roman empire, the roman empire was spread by them.\n\n \n Are you forgetting the state sponsorship of Arianism? \n \n \nA pope did not preside for hundreds of years after the spread of christianity.\n\n \n True, but you're clearly ignoring my main point here. Pre-Catholic Church christanity aside from Eastern Orthodox is not all that important aside from the council here and there. My point that you are clearly not wanting to discuss is how the Roman Catholic Church used violence as a means of not only enforcing its doctrine as the correct one, but as a way of spreading 'proper' Christanity to regions as it grew. The RCC butchered dozens of sects because they would not agree to the RCC\"s view of Christanity. If that's not spreading the religion by the sword, nothing is. \n \n \nIslam only spread, exclusively by conquering the infidels. That was its initial purpose.\n\n \n Not really. Islam spread by force and by birth. And it was initially seen by its founders as a reformation of Judaism. Forgetting that aren't you? \n \n \nYou will also note that christianity does not continue to do things that it did during dark and middle ages.\n\n \n Neither does most of Islam. There are going to be throwbacks in all religions. \n \n \nIt is basically peaceful except for the occasional nut who blows up a clinic somewhere. Islam has whole nations willing to follow its radicalism.\n\n \n Yes it's radicalism, not Islam itself. And you are forgetting that there are litterally millions of people in the US who follow the hatred spewing filth of people like James Dobson and Pat Farwell who blame gays and gypsies for 9/11. My sublte point if you cannot ascertain it is that fundementalism is bad regardless of what religion you follow.\n \n \nYou are simply starting your memory of events too late. You need to go back to the first three centuries AD where christians died many horrible deaths rather than renounce their faith.\n\n \n You seem to be unaware of Roman policy. It was not that they believed in something different, it was that they refused to partake in the empire wide rituals. The Roman Empire was very open to different beliefs. It was not open to people rejecting this openess as it endangered the state by angering the Gods. Christians got away with this for a while by masquerding as Jews and utilizing the exception the Romans gave for the Jews. While they did suffer horrible deaths, it was not because they refused to renounce their faith. \n \n \nIslam was never subjected to such things. War, yes. Frying alive, or boiling, or flaying was not subjected on islamists. It was on christians.\n\n \n Are you seriously saying that at no time were Muslims subject to torture? That's insane. Need I remind you of the partion of India? Or how about what Christians did to captured Islamic soldiers in the Crusades? Or Hell how about the Muslims who refused to leave Spain? \n \n Let's just ignore what the Catholic Crusaders did to the enslaved or captured Eastern Orthodox Christians shall we? After all, it might just challenge your belief that Christanity isn't a blood soaked religion.",

Under those circumstances they laid out a plan to essentially decapitate the gov't and put a strong man in place (like Murbark) and then rapidly remove foreign troops. They're probably laughing at us right now for trying democracy in a place like Iraq. I have very illusions about democracy, especially after studying it in Japan, Germany and South Korea.

But, knowing that there are many Iraqi's who crave democracy I have trouble simply turning our back on their fate.\n\n \n Then we should arm those people and ensure they come out on top.",

   "\n 1. Or more likely we would have just invaded earlier and the war would still be going on. Bush Sr predicted what would have happened. It's a sham Jr didn't listen. Daddy knows best. \n 2. But their choices are influenced by our decisions and our actions. Bombing someone's house and killing their family is a action that will likely lead them to becomming terrorists. Not killing their family is also a action that will likely lead them not to be comming terrorists. The means are just as important as the ends. \n 3. Hence why we should have never invaded Iraq and instead used Afghanistan as the grounds for killing them. Advantages in artillery and air support, low populations and low develop. Unlike Iraq which is the opposite of those. The goal of a inferior force is to lure its enemy into a position where its advantages are reduced or even neutralized. In this position the playing field is leveled in some degree. We should never ever, ever fight a war like that. Fair fights results in unfavorable outcomes to us. You'd think we would have learned from Mogadishu....\n 4. Essentially several stragetists were talking to their Israeli counterparts about the war. The Israelis set out a plan about what they would have done and acted quite shocked that the US was serious about occupation. Under those circumstances they laid out a plan to essentially decapitate the gov't and put a strong man in place (like Murbark) and then rapidly remove foreign troops. They're probably laughing at us right now for trying democracy in a place like Iraq. I have very illusions about democracy, especially after studying it in Japan, Germany and South Korea. The ME has a history of being ruled by Dictators for a reason. \n 5. Probably something worse then what happened after the US abandoned the Shiite uprisings. You gotta wonder if they are still angry at us about that. We did leave them to the slaughter. \n 6. Democracy is something people must do themselves, not have imposed upon them. It's been 50 years since Japan was imposed on by Democracy and they still haven't gotten it right. They make the US look representative. \n 7. Then we should arm those people and ensure they come out on top.\n\n \n 1. Sorry, you're speculating. Had Hussein obliged the inspectors, Bush could not have wrangled this outcome. \n 2. We seem to have a difference of definitions. I do not consider all combatants as terrorist. Only those who chose to kill fellow unarmed, unsuspecting Iraqis as a means to an end. No matter how it gets spun, targeting fellow countrymen is a personal choice as would taking up arms as a militiaman be.\n 3. Very true. But, Bush as Clinton in Mogadishu could not forsee the lack of support of the very people the mission was planned to help.\n 4. Good points about the possibilities of democracies in the ME. But, as Americans who have total faith in the concept it was bound to be attempted at some point. I suspect that the common folk of the ME lack the education, therefore the interest in the possibility of exercising control over their own lives. They do however express interest in exercising control over our lives making them a serious long range threat to our way of life. \n 5. I am convinced that no matter what America does, Muslims will be mad at us about something. All the credit for their anger has been placed on Bush, But the attack on the U.S. took a long time to plan and prepare for exposing the fact that they were angry long before the Bush Jr. administration. \n 6. Agreed. democracy does not appeal to most societies as I believe they prefer to be led by the nose ring. \n 7. Probably the best way to handle it. I suspect that Pelosi will succeed in bringing about the abandonment of Iraq and that these people will meet their fate regardless of my respect to their right to be a alive. But based on having two family members functioning in Iraq and having a close Iraqi friend, I hope for the continued attempt of \"imposing\" democracy on the people of Iraq.",

   "I'm not an expert on the Roman Empire, nor Christianity, but I think you're taking a great deal of license in your assertions regarding history.\n \n There's no doubt IMHO, that Christianity and the Roman Empire are closely intertwined, both for better and for worse.\n \n However, to suggest that early Christians, and Christianity, caused the expansion of the Roman Empire, is rather absurd. I would concede that Christianity likely played a role in the continued expansion of the empire post Constantine, but I would not concede that it was the driving force behind that expansion. Similarly, I would hold the same position regarding Christianity and the fall of the empire.\n \n Christianity had spread, but it was a minor religion among numerous others until it was sanctioned as the official religion of the Roman Empire, at which point it spread, often by force, to all corners of the empire. Had the Roman Empire not been as expansive and powerful as it was, it would be rather hard to argue that Christianity would have preferentially spread to the extent that it did, and remained the power it was, after the fall of the Empire.\n \n Waxy\n\n \n \n Perhaps I am taking a bit too much license. I will accept your qualifier concerning constantine and the fall of the roman empire. However, none of this proves anythign about islam. Islam only began by conquering. Christianity began by martyrdom.",
