   "You probably have heard it before but here it goes.

Since no matter how many times you do this you can't even count to 2, it must be impossible to count to 5, right? 5 probably doesn't exist.

   "The point of this apparent paradox was, if I recally correctly, to demonstrate that time must proceed in tiny but discrete steps and cannot be smoothly continuous.\n \n The reasoning is thus: our perception of time (how 'long' something seems to take to occur) is related to our physiology. There's nothing to say that a millisecond is 'fast' or a million years is 'slow' other than the rate at which our bodies and minds operate, right? Our perception of time is linked to a sequence of events in our brains.\n \n If time is continuous, however, the number of things that can happen between one millisecond and the next is infinite - no more or less infinite than the number of things that can happen between one millennium and the next (infinity is weird). However small you make the interval, there are still an infinite number of events contained within it. And since our perception of time is derived from a sequence of events, we are perpetually incapable of doing anything because there's always an infinite number of things that have to happen first.\n \n Zeno didn't have computers to work with, otherwise he'd probably have employed them in his paradox. The universe can be likened to a computation device for working out 'what happens next'; it doesn't matter how 'fast' a computer is, if you ask it to list all the numbers between zero and one, in order, it is bound to fail. Not only will it never reach 1, it'll never reach 0.1, or 0.001, or 0.00000000000000000000000000001.",
