   "\"But unless you repent, you too will all perish.\" - Jesus, Luke 13:3\n \n LOS ANGELES (Sept. 24, 2009) - Susan Atkins, a follower of cult leader Charles Manson whose remorseless witness stand confession to killing pregnant actress Sharon Tate in 1969 shocked the world, has died. She was 61 and had been suffering from brain cancer.\n \n The matronly, gray-haired Atkins who appeared before a parole board in 2000 cut a far different figure than that of the cocky young defendant some 30 years earlier. \"I don't have to just make amends to the victims and families,\" she said softly. \"I have to make amends to society. I sinned against God and everything this country stands for.\" She said she had found redemption in Christianity. The last words she spoke in public at the September hearing were to say in unison with her husband: \"My God is an amazing God.\"\n \n Charles Manson Follower Susan Atkins Dies\n \n The Bishop of Rochester, Dr Michael Nazir-Ali, has defended traditional biblical teachings on homosexuality and said the Church should not be \"rolled over by culture\". The Bible's teaching shows that marriage is between a man and a woman. That is the way to express our sexual nature. \"We welcome homosexuals, we don't want to exclude people, but we want them to repent and be changed.\" \n \n Change and repent, bishop tells gays - Telegraph\n \n Biblically speaking, assuming Susan Atkins repentance and conversion was legitimate, she will get to heaven before the unrepentant gay pride practicioners.  And that would include Matthew Shepard, were he one who refused to repent of any gay sex sin in his life.\n \n Discussion...",

They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. Jude 7\n \n \n \n Many adulterers love each other too, but that's also a sin. As the Bible says, \"Love does a neighbor no harm\" (Romans 13:10), like enticing someone into a sinful relationship. And, \"Love does not rejoice in iniquity\" - 1 Corinthians 13.\n \n Accipiter - I'll put you down as one of the 450 prophets of Baal on Mt. Carmel. You can read about that in the Bible too.\n \n And the pro-gay crowd STILL hasn't repented!!\n\n \n I decided that every night before I go to bed I am going to repent.\n \n Is everything ok for me now or do I need to be a bigot too?\n \n How about if I hate people like you instead of the gay folks?",

   "Bull. You are determined NOT TO REPENT. You are prideful and will not repent of your sin. Gay sex is a sin and it's your idol and you will not repent, will you? You mock what Jesus said about repenting. You think that's for everyone but yourself. How do you justify that self-righteous attitude??\n\n \n What attitude? Because I am defending one whom I love and cherish it is pride? Easy your defending the defamation and prejudice of a whole group of diverse people! Have I not already stated that it is not merely about sex? Have I? I have made it clear on multiple points that sex is not the main focal point of being gay but the love and attraction Easy.\n \n The sheer feeling of your heart leaping out of your chest when your partner gives you that special look, or when your hands brush, or when you get that special kiss before going off to work.
