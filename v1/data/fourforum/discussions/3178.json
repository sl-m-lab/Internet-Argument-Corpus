   "The other day Senator Tom Harkin came out public and spoke against Bush. He said, \n \n \"This is about George Bush getting special favors. This is about George Bush getting special privileges. This is about George Bush not doing his duty in the National Guard and then lying to the American people about it. Mr. Bush has repeatedly insisted that he did his duty. We now know this isn't true. The documentation shows that the president was not being truthful. The president lied to the American people in the Oval Office. Americans deserve to know the truth, and we won't know the whole truth until the president himself meets these facts head on.\n \n \n And he based this absurd claim of his on the documents supposedly found by CBS, which have basically been proven false. How would you feel if you were Senator Harkin and you called President Bush a liar publicly, and you based it on some false document? Should he apologize to the President of the United States for lying about him? I sure as hell would contemplate moving to another country.\n \n \n These comments come from the same man who called Cheney a coward for not spilling blood in Vietnam. He also said, \"When I hear this coming from Dick Cheney, who was a coward, who would not serve during the Vietnam War, it makes my blood boil.\" But apparently Harkin lied about his own service in Vietnam and was in fact never in Vietnam. So in effect, Harkin called himself a coward. Harkin is familiar with Vietnam lies. The following excerpt is from a Wall Street Journal news story by James M. Perry from December 26, 1991. \n \n \n \"In 1979, Mr. Harkin, then a congressman, participated in a round-table discussion arranged by the Congressional Vietnam Veterans' Caucus. ''I spent five years as a Navy pilot, starting in November of 1962,\" Mr. Harkin said at that meeting, in words that were later quoted in a book, Changing of the Guard, by Washington Post political writer David Broder. 'One year was in Vietnam. I was flying F-4s and F-8s on combat air patrols and photo-reconnaissance support missions. I did no bombing,'\" said the peacenik Harkin. \n \n \"'That clearly is not an accurate picture of his Navy service.... Mr. Harkin's Navy record shows his only decoration is the National Defense Service Medal, awarded to everyone on active service during those years. He did not receive either the Vietnam Service medal or the Vietnam Campaign medal, the decorations given to everyone who served in the Southeast Asia theater.' \n \n \"It turned out Mr. Harkin had not seen combat and was stationed in Japan. What's more, Mr. Cheney isn't the first Vice President to fall victim to Mr. Harkin's acid tongue. In an editorial in 1988, we quoted 'Senator Tom Harkin who served in Vietnam' (we thought at the time) saying of his Senate colleague Dan Quayle, who did not serve in Vietnam: 'It's so ironic; they get in Congress or the government and become big hawks. Don't they have any shame at all?'  \n \n \n \n It looks like Harkin is just out there to verbally assault anyone who didn't serve in Vietnam, even though he himself never served in Vietnam, yet claimed that he did.",
