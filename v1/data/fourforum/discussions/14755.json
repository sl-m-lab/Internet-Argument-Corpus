   "Our endangered right to self-defence\n \n \nCommon-law traditions and the Criminal Code give Canadians the right to defend their lives and property; and, in some cases, to intervene to protect the lives and property of others. And yet, Canadians who exercise these rights often find themselves hit with criminal charges.\n \n Take the case of Burton, N.B., neighbours Brian Fox and Lawrence Manzer, both retired Canadian Forces members and victims of repeated break-ins and acts of vandalism on their property.\n \n The pair had contacted local police, an RCMP detachment, numerous times. But the police said there was little they could do about crimes against property unless the perpetrators were caught in the act. Last March, Fox discovered three intruders on his property just before 3 a.m. He and his son rushed outside to confront the intruders before they could get away. Manzer also ran outside to help his neighbour, carrying an unloaded shotgun and a fistful of shells, while his wife phoned the police.\n \n The intruders were drunk teenagers, easily subdued. Manzer, seeing there was no risk of danger, put his unloaded firearm back into storage, locking it up, as required by law. The police arrived and arrested the teens; and one was fined for underage drinking. While no other action was taken against them, the spree of break-ins and vandalism stopped after this incident.\n \n But that wasn't the end of it. In a twist akin to the trial of Toronto shopkeeper David Chen (charged for performing a citizen's arrest on a habitual thief ), Fox was arrested for assault six days later, and Manzer was arrested for pointing a firearm. While the assault charge against Fox was dropped, Manzer faces a court date next week on the reduced charge of possessing a weapon for a purpose dangerous to public peace.\n \n Such is the state of self-defence law in Canada today. The intruders get off with one fine between them; the military veteran coming to the aid of his neighbour while carrying an unloaded, legal weapon is called a threat to public peace.\n \n The reluctance of the police to sanction our right to self-defence was summed up in a statement by RCMP Sergeant Pierre Gervais. He offered a general comment to citizens who might find themselves in a similar situation as Fox and Manzer: \"If you're not in immediate danger, or if you can safely disengage from a situation, then please, call the police.\"\n \n But it's not true that citizens have a legal obligation to retreat from an intruder on their own property. Moreover, in this case, the police were called. As we know from the Chen case, however, that's no guarantee that the criminal in question will be apprehended -- or even that the police will bother dispatching anyone.\n \n Manzer and Fox are honest citizens who stepped in to fill a void in the law, and took reasonable, measured steps to detain criminals who might have posed a direct threat to their persons and property. The force used was reasonable and the police were swiftly called. That these men should then themselves be treated like criminals speaks loudly to the urgent need for an immediate review of the laws of self-defence and citizen's arrest.\n \n The wages of crimes should be paid by criminals -- not the victims who intervene to stop them.\n\n \n Yet another example of why Canada doesn't qualify as an -as Galileo loves to put it so often- \"other developed nation\".",
