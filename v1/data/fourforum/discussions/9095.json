   "Republicans and Democrats working together? It's all just a fantasy at FantasyCongress.org, a new web game that brings the concept of fantasy sports to politics.\n \n Fantasy Congress, created by four Claremont McKenna College students in California, allows people to compete against their friends with teams of lawmakers who rack up scores based on legislative accomplishments.\n \n Membership at fantasycongress.org is free and word of mouth has already seen some 15,000 people sign up with more coming in every day. Fantasy Congress is expected to go live after November 7th when Congress returns.\n \n http://www.fantasycongress.org/fc/\n \n \n Quote from: http://campaignnews.info/2006/10/27/its-all-just-a-fantasy-at-fantasycongressorg/",
