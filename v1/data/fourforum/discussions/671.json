   "The problem with this debate is that it becomes too emotional. Mind you, most biologists have no use for emotionalism as it applies to the debate because for them there is no debate. Not about evolution as accepted scientific theory, though smaller debates about the details exist (i.e. is evolutuion a slow-moving process or a fast-moving one?). At this time, I would like to extend a sincere thank you to all of the posters of this forum with a scientific background who spend time engaging in debates which you know to be totally irrelevant. I want to assure you that it is indeed relevant, however, simply because it is being read and sorely needed educatiosn gained. I do not know what kind of traffic YouDebate.com pulls in on a monthly basis. I imagine not much. Irregardless, just as sports figures may be said to have a certain obligation to the community (writing autograohs, appearing in \"Don't do drugs\" advertisements, etc.) scientists have an obligation --- as small or as large as each individual wants to make it --- to do something to help increase general appreciation for and educaton in the scientific method. This can be done on a one-on-one basis. So to all those who enjoy a good debate and post here, your time is not wasted: you're putting in your community service and writing words that may be read and affect change months from now for one person, two people, three people or more. They will in turn spread the benefit of the small educations you've provided them. Hopefully it will foster enough interest to make them pursue their educations further. But the first task at hand unfortunately involves the most daunting part of your mission: disproving myths. And myths abound. So again, I personally thank all of you for your indulgence.\n \n On any debate which brings science and religion in direct conflict, both parties involved must be prepared to fight on the grounds of science and religion. The scientist may understand that religion is completely irrelevent in his pursuits. The religious person may understand that science has no baring whatsoever on his faith. And yet, here we are. These two things, science and religion, have conflicted. The scientist may say it is nothing more than the objections of the religious thinker which have caused the conflict and that in order for the conflict to be solved, those objections must somehow be silenced. The religious person in turn believes that science has gone too far, that their interpretation of evidence in the pyhisical world stands in direct conflict with his beliefs, and therefore the interpretations should be changed.\n \n This conflict can never be won or lost. No single argument on this forum, no matter how conclusive, will solve the problem.\n \n The conflict will eventually dissolve as science gathers more evidence in favor of evolution. Science at one time new that the Earth wasn't the center of the universe, but it took a long time for society to give up their arrogant (and to a large part religiously motivated) ideas. Society will also grasp and cling and bite and scratch and kick and claw to hold on to their erroneous belief in creationsim. In makind's arrogance, proven time and time again, we don't want to believe that we share a common ancestor with modern apes. I say we in a figurative sense. I personally find it fascinating and believe that once people take that step toward accepting their own role in the evolutionary development of species on Earth, an entire plethora of questions are opened to them which are FAR more interesting than these tired old debates about whether it was really evolution or the snap of some celestial fingers which did it.\n \n Can science be wrong? Of course. Science is wrong about a lot of things all the time, and what always proves science wrong is science itself. The religious establishment has never proven science wrong about a single thing, unless the religious establishment itself has contracted scientists to do the research for them. And if that is the case --- scientists working on behalf of religion, then the objectivity of those scientists may be questioned (but not necessarly foudn to be lacking). To my knowledge, the only religious establishment with the kind of money and resources needed to directly question the scientific establishment is the Catholic Church. And say what you want about the church (I certainly have), but it seems to be the most liberal in terms of accepting what science says to be valid. The Pope, I promise you, did not make his announcement in favor of evolution based on his own casual internet explorations. He has a very large staff of people very knowledgeable in science who at one point probably came to him and said \"Your excellency, we simply cannot avoid this evidence any longer.\"\n \n See http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP961022.HTM\n \n (continued on next message)",

   "(continued from last message)\n \n By contrast, little Christian website ministries don't have quite the resoruces of the Roman Catholic Church. Neither does Pastor Billy Bob Franklin who collects money every Sunday which he promises to put toward a new wing of the church where big plans are in the works to create a Christian Educational Center (and that wing never seems to get built but the pastor's suits get shinier --- I know: been there and done that and seen it in more than one church with my very own eyes). All that most churches or ministries can do is look at the very objections of science to evolution, never telling their flock that some of these objections are outdated, some of them are mere questions about the details of evolution, some are out of context, some are outright lies and yes, every once in a while they come up with questions that science has posed and cannot yet answer. Because of a question that cannot be answered, these churches and creationists in general would have the march of evolutionary science halted forever, despite all of the questions which have been answered and are being answered constantly. I am not saying religion wants us to go backwards (some do), but they certainly don't seem to be in any rush to move forward. It is the stunted, arrested, status quo mentality of religious fanaticism. It is inevitable: when stagnant thinkers and forward thinkers exchange ideas, the result is always coflict.\n \n And at last, here we have our evolution debate.\n \n Broken down, taking into account both sides, certain rules of engagement should be followed:\n \n *The Evolution Debate, whether or not science likes it, carries with it certain philosophical implications for a substantial percentage of the population. If part of the scientific community endeavors to win minds, it must be prepared to carry the debate with all due respect into that realm.\n \n *The Creationist Argument, whether or not theology likes it, in part or in whole, cannot be supported by the kind of evidential standards inherent to scientific method. Most if not all of it must be taken on faith. \n \n *Science has no place commenting on faith.\n \n *Religion has no place commenting on scientific evidence.\n \n *When it comes to the debate on evolution, the last two rules will sometimes fade.\n \n *Very little, if any, common ground can be found between the two modes of thinking. Note: this does not necessarily invalidate the possibility of God or even a Christian God.\n \n The whole debate is actually quite absurd, as the two participants have no Earthly business mixing aside from the fact that occasionally they endeavor to answer the same big questions. But the questions do not exist in the same realm. It's almost like a man who broke his foot after a negligent driver ran over it. Now we have a problem: the broken foot. Two men, a doctor and a lwayer, happen to be standing there while it happens. The doctor wants to tend to the foot and the lawyer wants to find the guy who did it. The doctor and the lawyer both start bickering over who should take presidence. Clearly, the foot must receive medical attention. By the same token, the victim is deserving of some restitution for his damages. It's not as apparent in my analogy as you might think as to which need is more crucial at which time, either. While the man might be in great pain, he may also be producing enough adrenaline to ignore it has he shakes his fist in the air at the unknown car now screeching around the corner. At this time, the answer is clear: the doctor needs to settle the patient down long enough to be able to examine the extent of damage on the foot. The lawyer needs to dash around the corner and see if he can catch the license plate, then start interviewing possible eyewitnesses. But in my analogy neither the doctor nor the lawyer are doing their jobs: both are bickering about which is more important, which is more needed, which is more correct: treatment or restitution.\n \n This is why I say the debate on evolution is actually an absurd one because the question (the broken foot in my example) can be answered in two completely seperate realms of study. One side doesn't need get involved with the other. But inevitably they do.\n \n I chose the side of evolution in this debate simply because I believe science has the right to investigate anything that it deems worthy. I also believe that Christians, who maintain the theology that God gave us free will, should let science do what it may. I think it's the height of stupidity for Christianity to question widely accepted scientific theory with nothing more than a book that was written by non-scientists. I would think it was just as stupid if science tried to questoin faith which is something that cannot be tested using convential scientific methods. But agan, here we are, and I hope I have not missed anything with my list of the rules of engagement. The two do mix, debate, conflict, and there seems to be no getting around it. Some people say \"I will believe it when science finds a smoking gun.\" It doesn't seem to be enough that science has found several smoking guns and has even watched and recorded some of the guns being fired. Maybe science will have to find and record a smoking ICBM launch before most people will come around. Even then, it's hard to banish old and irrational fears: \"Oh no, mercy me, you don't really think my granddaddy was a chimp do ya?\" Maybe science needs to take mankind down a few more notches. Show us how small we really are in the infinite scheme of things. The irony is --- to me at least --- that for every notch that science lowers us, we are rasied another ten notches in the bigger picture. So WHAT if granddaddy was an ape. He sure did produce some brilliant offspring capable of feats he could have never imagined. Granddaddy, thank you. And thank you too, great great great grandma, a.k.a. Old Lady Salamander. You were survivors, and now here I am writing this post. Isn't real life infinately more fascinating than POOF!\n \n MQ",

If that were true, then most of the crackpot creationists like Mr. Kent Hovind, Mr. Carl Baugh would disappear. But these guys are still respected in the creationist world. But they don't do scientific research and they don't publish.\n \n Tell you what, lappster. Why don't you show us one journal that reports real creation research.

As modern science developed certain religious people realized that the conclusions of science contradicted the mythology written in their holy book. So of course, the creationists rejected reality in favor of mythology. Christian fundamentalism was born of the reaction against science.

   "This taken from author Phillip E. Johnson\n \n In 1995 the National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) passed a resolution that tells us what is implied by the slogan \"evolution is a fact:\" \n \n \"The diversity of life on earth is the outcome of evolution: an unsupervised, impersonal, unpredictable, and natural process of temporal descent with genetic modification that is affected by natural selection, chance, historical contingencies, and changing environments.\"\n \n This statement is contrary to the evidence in many respects: \n 1. Mutation can't create the immense amounts of useful information required for creative evolution. Even the exceptional mutations that have beneficial effects (like the human sickle-cell gene) do not involve the creation of new organs or capabilities. The developmental mutations on which you rely are no exception. Most are harmful, and the few that are not only explain the loss of a structure, or its replacement by a pre-existing one in the same organism, never the emergence of a new complex organ. Adding natural selection to the mechanism doesn't help, because selective death only preserves what mutation has already created. \n 2. The fossil record, despite decades of effort by paleontologists determined to find transitional sequences, is still overwhelming characterized by the absence of gradual macroevolutionary transformations. Darwinists have to avoid or downplay this evidence, and they do. For example, the high school textbooks ignore the Cambrian explosion, and never inform students about the problems posed for the Darwinian theory by this sudden appearance of the animal phyla. Instead they tell hominid stories, thus relying on the evidence most amenable to subjective evaluation. \n 3. The latest evidence from molecular biology confirms that the living world is full of irreducibly complex structures. Scientific reviewers have conceded that Behe's description of the molecular evidence is accurate. They refuse to consider intelligent design on philosophical grounds, because they think that \"science\" requires an unquestioning adherence to materialism. \n 4. Embryology is continually misrepresented as demonstrating a pattern of ancestral inheritance at the beginning, with diversity emerging in later development. This kind of pattern would support the common ancestry hypothesis, but the facts are otherwise. The earliest stages of development, contrary to the impression given by the NOVA program and the textbooks, are radically different. \n 5. The public advocates for Darwinism approach their subject with a messianic zeal that contradicts their claim to be objective, dispassionate, scientists. They reveal or omit evidence depending upon whether they think it will help them to convince the public. They rely heavily on ridicule, and on appeals to their own authority, to defend their position. \n \"Evolution,\" as defined by the NABT, is a materialist philosophical doctrine that contradicts the best available scientific evidence. You say that we who doubt are prejudiced, are ignoring mountains of scientific evidence, and so on. Baloney. The crucial mechanism that supports the materialism rests upon a huge, unjustified extrapolation from very limited evidence of variation in fundamentally stable populations. Neo-Darwinism survives only by the selective use of evidence, and because materialist philosophy has no alternative.",

You look into the microscope, you see the little bugs moving around in an 'agitated' manner. You publish your findings. Months later other labs around the world read your work. There is some doubt. Other scientists have samples of the bug. Each conducts their own observations under similar conditions, and lo! they agree with your description. Your paper then enters the main-stream of thought as a 'truth' concerning an aspect of this bug. \n BUT WAIT... it's not as simple as that. To observe the bacteria, you used a microscope. You used light shining up on a little mirror so you could see the bugs. The bugs may have reacted to the unwanted concentration of light. What you described as how they acted, was only how they acted while you were observing them! \n (a paraphrasing of an example from \"Chaos\" by Gleick) \n So, things aren't always as simple as they seem. \n How do we judge? \n \"It is not perhaps without good reason that we attribute to simple-mindedness a readiness to believe anything and to ignorance the readiness to be convinced, for I think I was once taught hat a belief is like an impression stamped on our soul: the softer and less resisting the soul, the easier it is to print anything on it...On the other hand there is a silly arrogance in continuing to disdain something and to condemn it as false just because it seems unlikely to us. That is a common vice among those who think their capacities are above the ordinary\". \n \"That it is madness to judge the true and the false from our own capacities\", Michel de Montaigne (1993), \"The Essays: A Selection\", Penguin Classics, p74. \n Perhaps, then, we need an authority not tainted by such foibles. The only candidate that comes to my mind is God, the knower of all. There are some things that we can not understand. It is wrong to be critical of them, simply because we can not comprehend them. \n \"If someone had decided to make something, and had finished it, then he will call his thing perfect - and so will anyone who rightly knows, or thinks he knows, the mind and purpose of the author of the work. For example, if someone sees a work (which I suppose to be not yet completed), and knows that the purpose of the author of that work is to build a house, he will say that it is imperfect. On the other han, he will call it perfect as soon as he sees that the work has been carried through to the end which its author had decide to give it. but if someone sees a work whose like he has never seen, and does not know the mind of its maker, he will, of course, not be able to know whether that work is perfect or imperfect. And this seems to have been the first meaning of these words. \n But after men began to form universal ideas, and devise models of houses...and the like, and to prefer some models of things to others, it came about that each one called perfect what he saw agreed with the universal idea he had formed of this kind of thing, and imperfect, what he saw agreed less with the model he had conceived, even though its maker thought he had entirely finished it. \n Nor does there ever seem to be any other reason why men also commonly call perfect or imperfect natural things, which have not been made by human hand. For they are accustomed to form universal ideas of natural things as much as they do of artificial ones. They regard these universal ideas as models of things, and believe that Nature (which they think does nothing except for the sake of some end) looks to them, and sets them before itself as models. So when they see something happen in Nature which does not agree with the model they have conceived of this kind of thing, they believe that Nature itself has failed or sinned, and left the thing imperfect.\" \n Benedict de Spinozza, (1996) \"Ethics\", Penguin Classics, p114.",

   "\"Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem\" (\"Entities should not be multiplied more than necessary\") sometimes attributed to William of Occam (or:\"The simplest explanation is probably the right explanation\"). Does Evolutionary Theory adhere to this? Let's look at the evidences.\n \n As mentioned earlier there are several contradictory schools of thought about the ascent of man. How is it that evolution can be a 'fact'? Sure, each and every evidence presented by these schools is said to support evolution, but that must in itself draw you to suspect the protagonists.\n \n Here's how I see you arguing in favour of multiple evidences pointing to one conclusion. \n A court of law is called to hear who killed person 'X'. \n The first expert witness says that I did it. \n Another expert witness says that you did it. \n Both are mutually exclusive but both still point to the fact that someone shot person 'X' to death. \n The coroner called leave an 'open verdict' that a person or person(s) known may have contributed to the death of person 'X'. \n That is how evolutionary theory would work... mutually discrediting evidences still find that evolution works. \n Problems with this arise... \n 1) You would question the 'expert' tag of someone who finds the complete opposite of another 'expert' \n more importantly \n 2) You are only taking into account the testimonies of some witnesses... you PH have already excluded testimony from witnesses who saw the person die in a miraculous manner... simply because they are not 'experts' in fact you'd prefer two contradictory 'experts' to billions of non-expert witnesses who are all in agreement. \n 3) There are some expert witnesses who also tend to agree with the people in point 2), but you dismiss them as well... because you don't want to know of an 'act of God' explanation. \n In fact, in this trial, you have four witnesses* each competing as experts... so long as they all agree with the fact that someone killed him. \n We could at least all agree that the person is dead, but how the person came to be dead is another matter.",

   "There are some authors of posts on this who practice the trade of dishonest critique. Without addressing any issues they tend to get rather abusive very quickly, and provide pithy hollow arguments. 'Attack! Attack! Attack!' I guess if you make enough noise someone will listen.\n \n However, the problem remains, despite their grand-standing, tantrums and name calling.\n \n There is evidence, and then there is evidence.\n \n There is evidence for Darwinian theory, only if you make massive leaps of assumption... hence the same evidence can be used to say that man evolved in a certain lineage, whilst using the same evidence, other scientists may come up with a completely different lineage. This is because the pieces of evidence don't easily fit together in any discernable way. They can, like a deck of cards, be re-shuffled.\n \n It happens with the question of the ascent of Man, and with Ammonites, and with birds, and with horses etc. Evolution's evidences can be remarkably well-suited to a plethora of schools of thought.\n \n Archaeopteryx was originally thought to be on the direct line from reptile/dinosaur to birds, now it's been moved off into a quiet cul-de-sac... an evolutionary dead-end. What has changed about Archaeopteryx? Nothing really, as the fossils were found more than 100 years ago. (Nothing about the bird breathing system is ever raised because that provides even greater problems).\n \n The fluidity of 'proof' is why it is so hard to argue against evolution, because\n a) not all evolutioanries agree to any one set of terms\n or\n b) they will always retreat to the realm of 'well, it might just have happened that way'.\n \n There is evidence to suggest that animals gradually changed over a very long period of time. But the same evidence can be used to suggest that animals changed rapidly over relatively short periods of time.\n \n \n \n Here is a short list of changed theories.\n \"Homo sapiens neanderthalensis (Neanderthal man) - 150 years ago Neanderthal reconstructions were stooped and very much like an 'ape-man'. It is now admitted that the supposedly stooped posture was due to disease and that Neanderthal is just a variation of the human kind.\n Ramapithecus - once widely regarded as the ancestor of humans, it has now been realised that it is merely an extinct type of orangutan (an ape).\n Eoanthropus (Piltdown man) - a hoax based on a human skull cap and an orangutan's jaw. It was widely publicized as the missing link for 40 years.\n Hesperopithecus (Nebraska man) - based on a single tooth of a type of pig now only living in Paraguay.\n Pithecanthropus (Java man) - now renamed to Homo erectus.\n Australopithecus africanus - this was at one time promoted as the missing link. It is no longer considered to be on the line from apes to humans. It is very ape-like.\n Sinanthropus (Peking man) was once presented as an ape-man but has now been reclassified as Homo erectus.\"\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/Docs/263.asp",
