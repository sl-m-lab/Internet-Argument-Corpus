   "that depends entirely on the couple. if it doesn't come between the two of them (****ing vs making love argument), then i'd say it isn't a problem. certainly its not healthy, and jealousy can run rampant, but i can see some couples using this for when they can't be together- for example, on business trips, to keep each other faithful, perhaps with the promise that the described actions could be acted out when they are together again.\n \n however: there are a great many attachment issues that many couples deal with- a sense of posession ('she's MINE, he can't make her cum! i'll kill him!' or vice versa) that, although unhealthy, does help 'keep the peace'. if the relationship in question is one of those, i'd heartily suggest masturbation to sate any 'excess' sexual energy on the part of one or both partners, if sex isn't an option.\n \n i think it comes down to the couple in question needing to either talk about it, or for the person participating in cybersex to be a heartless sonofabitch who takes GREAT care to hide or erase their a) logs, b) cookies, and c) contacts- however, if the second option is chosen, they had better hope their partner (in real life) is completely oblivious.",

I see a few married people at work do the \"minimizing monitor\" shuffle with their computer monitor, when I walk up unexpected to their desk. I dont think some people understand that even though they cannot touch the people they are chatting to, they are still breaking the bond of trust to their mates, which that break in itself is devasting to a marriage.",
