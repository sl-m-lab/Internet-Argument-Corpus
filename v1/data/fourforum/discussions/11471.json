   "\"Sincere Christians genuinely want to know God better. They have been lied into believing that the Bible is the word of God and that by reading it and believing in it, they are bringing themselves closer to God. This Deist Challenge to Christians should free, or at least help to free, these sincere Christians and allow them to realize that they have been duped into believing that Christianity and the Bible are the way to God. Once sincere Christians realize they have been duped by Christianity, they are free to examine Deism, which teaches that God gave us reason so we can apply it to the designs in Nature and realize that those designs presuppose a Designer of nature, or God.\n \n The challenge to Christians is to prove Mark 16:18 which says those who believe in the Gospels will be able to \"lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\" If this is true, then Christians would be able to go to any sick person anywhere and lay their Christian hands on them, and they would recover. The fact that we have millions of very sick people around the world tells us that either this Bible promise is false or that Christians really don't care about the sick, otherwise they would lay their hands on them and they would be healed! And if they could in fact heal people, there would be no need for doctors, nurses, hospitals, health care or Michael Moore's documentary, Sicko!\n \n The World Union of Deists hereby challenges Christian clergy to demonstrate the truth of this Bible promise before the world. Christian clergy should make arrangements by emailing me at bob@deism.com to conduct a verifiable public healing of a terminally ill person. If a member of the Christian clergy, or any Christian, contacts me to meet this Deist challenge, I will make all arrangements for the test of this Biblical promise and will post the information here along with the results of the test.\n \n The falsehoods of the Bible need to be exposed so people can make progress in their lives and in society. As Thomas Paine wrote, \"It is an affront to truth to treat falsehoods with complaisance.\" \"\n \n from http://www.deism.com/challengetochristians.htm",

Their pundits often think deism was the majority religious viewpoint amongst the founding fathers.\nI'm not sure I follow your point. Okay, Deism is small relative to Christianity. And your point is?\n \n Deism was a major belief among the founding fathers. Afterall, the founding fathers escaped religious persecution to found a new world without dogmatism.\n \n \nDeism\n \"Deism\" is a loosely used term that describes the views of certain English and continental thinkers.

Deists in the United States never amounted to more than a small percentage of an evangelical population.\nI'm not sure where you got the evangelical idea. The last thing a deist wants to do is to evangelize.\n From the Library of CongressI would suggest you take the time to read the letters of the founding fathers before making your judgement. I have and they are clearly NOT Christian and are opposed to dogma from any religion.\n Religion in 18th-Century America (Religion and the Founding of the American Republic, Library of Congress Exhibition) \n \nA true deist was one who believed God created the universe and then sat back and (1) did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations and, (2) did not give (divine) revelation to man.\nPartially true. A Deist is one who believes in God, creater of the universe and their bible is nature. Apart from that a Deist can believe anything else they wish.\n \n In addition, one of the standard definitions of Deism, then and now, is this: \n \n \nDeism is defined in Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary, 1941, as: \"[From Latin Deus, God.Deity] The doctrine or creed of a Deist.\" And Deist is defined in the same dictionary as: \"One who believes in the existence of a God or supreme being but denies revealed religion, basing his belief on the light of nature and reason.\" \nPrecisely. And reason clearly dictates the bible is full of murder, rape, incest, the killing of children, slavery, etc. A God who created the universe is not one who gave this information to primitive man. These rantings are of men who were ignorant and anything they couldn't explain was placed in a position of \"religion\" thereby explaining it.\n \nAlong these lines many would argue that, according to 18th century deism, God would not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. He was like the watchmaker who created / wound up the universe and then sat back and didn't involve himself further. \nAgain, your point here is?\n \nAnd while Paine may have argued against \"revealed religion,\" many of the individuals who today classify Jefferson, Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and other founding fathers as strict \"deists\" have to contend with any number of quotations from these individuals, which to the contrary, show that they believed God did involve himself in the affairs of men and nations.  \nYou mixed a couple of points here. Read Thomas Paine. He describes in great detail why he feels it healthier for the spirit not to believe in Christianity than to believe in it. And you're correct about the founding fathers. Simply because they believed in some cases that God may involve himself in the affairs of men does not make them Christian or tied to any dogma.\n \nAnyway, the Library of Congress, in the link above, confirms that \"Deists in the United States never amounted to more than a small percentage of an evangelical population.\" I think that puts it in its proper perspective.\n \n So much for Deism... \nAgain, your point?\n \n I think the underlying message from you is that America was founded on Christian principles and that the US is a Christian nation. Neither is true. Show me the 10 commandments in any of the founding documents or reference to the bible. There are none. The founders of this country were bright people. Who at 33 years of age today could write such a document as the Declaration of Independence with so much brilliance and insight for the future? Jefferson did.\n \n Once can pick up a great deal of insight into Deism at Welcome To The Deism Site!",

Why it matters who or how many signed the declaration of independence is a mute point. \n \n The first 4 presidents were Deists.\n\n \n Thank you for your list. Let's start with Benjamin Franklin:\n \n \"I've lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing Proofs I see of this Truth &#8212;That God governs in the Affairs of Men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his Notice, is it probable that an Empire can rise without his Aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that except the Lord build the House they labor in vain who build it. I firmly believe this, &#8212;and I also believe that without his concurring Aid, we shall succeed in this political Building no better than the Builders of Babel: We shall be divided by our little partial local interests; our Projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a Reproach and Bye word down to future Ages.\" - Benjamin Franklin - Speech to the Constitutional Convention (June 28, 1787)\n \n It&#8217;s pretty obvious that Franklin believed in a God who did involve himself in the affairs of men and nations, and Franklin also alludes to the Bible as &#8220;Sacred Writings&#8221; which also reveal God&#8217;s revelation to man. \n \n Next, George Washington.\n \n He (Washington) was an open promoter of Christianity. For example, in his speech on May 12, 1779, he claimed that what children needed to learn &#8220;above all&#8221; was the &#8220;religion of Jesus Christ,&#8221; and that to learn this would make them &#8220;greater and happier than they already are&#8221;; on May 2, 1778, he charged his soldiers at Valley Forge that &#8220;To the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian&#8221;; and when he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the military on June 8, 1783, he reminded the nation that &#8220;without a humble imitation&#8221; of &#8220;the Divine Author of our blessed religion&#8221; we &#8220;can never hope to be a happy nation.&#8221; Washington's own adopted daughter declared of Washington that you might as well question his patriotism as to question his Christianity.\n \n In addition, the inscription on Washington's tomb at Mount Vernon is this:\n \n WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE REST THE REMAINS OF GENL. GEORGE WASHINGTON.\" Over the door of the inner tomb is inscribed: \"I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE.\" (note: I believe that came from Wallbuilders)\n \n Now, Thomas Jefferson:\n \n Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said: \n \n \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have \n removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the\n people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.\" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)\n \n Now, why should Jefferson tremble for his country if God does not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations?\n \n And then there's this:\n \n \"I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we\n are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their\n native land and planted them in a country flowing with all\n the necessities and comforts of life.\" (Monday, March 4,\n 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address)\n \n Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise. \n \n John Quincy Adams:\n \n Probably the closest to being a deist. However...\n \n On July 11, 1846, his 80th birthday, Adams entered this in his diary:\n \n \"I enter upon my 80th year, with thanksgiving to God for all the blessings and mercies which his providence has bestowed upon me....\"\n \n There, Adams believed God was involved in his life. Not a strict deist. More likely a Unitarian.\n \n In 1796, Adams denounced political opponent Thomas Paine's criticisms of Christianity, saying, \"The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will.\"[63]\n \n John Adams - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Samuel Adams\n \n \"Thou shall do no injury to they neighbor, is the voice of nature and reason, and it is confirmed by written revelation.\" - Governor Adams, 1794, addressing the state legislature of Massachussetts\n \n So there's that for starters. At the very least, Jefferson and Franklin do not match the definition of strict deists. I have more on Washington if you need it.",

   "George Washington a Deist??\n \n In Volume XII of these writings, Jared Sparks delved into the religious character of George Washington, and included numerous letters written by the friends, associates, and family of Washington which testified of his religious character. Based on that extensive evidence, Sparks concluded:\n \n To say that he [George Washington] was not a Christian would be to impeach his sincerity and honesty. Of all men in the world, Washington was certainly the last whom any one would charge with dissimulation or indirectness [hypocrisies and evasiveness]; and if he was so scrupulous in avoiding even a shadow of these faults in every known act of his life, [regardless of] however unimportant, is it likely, is it credible, that in a matter of the highest and most serious importance [his religious faith, that] he should practice through a long series of years a deliberate deception upon his friends and the public? It is neither credible nor possible.\n \n One of the letters Sparks used to arrive at his conclusion was from Nelly Custis-Lewis. While Nelly technically was the granddaughter of the Washingtons, in reality she was much more.\n \n When Martha [Custis] married George, she was a widow and brought two young children (John and Martha--also called Patsy) from her first marriage into her marriage with George. The two were carefully raised by George and Martha, later married, and each had children of their own. Unfortunately, tragedy struck, and both John and Patsy died early (by 1781). John left behind his widow and four young children ranging in age from infancy to six years old.\n \n Nelly was ten years old when Washington was called to the Presidency, and she grew to maturity during his two terms. During that time, she traveled with Washington and walked amidst the great foreign and domestic names of the day. On Washington's retirement, she returned with the family to Mount Vernon. Nelly was energetic, spry, and lively, and was the joy of George Washington's life. She served as a gracious hostess and entertained the frequent guests to Mount Vernon who visited the former President.\n \n \n On Washington's birthday in 1799, Nelly married Washington's private secretary, Lawrence Lewis. They spent several months on an extended honeymoon, visiting friends and family across the country. On their return to Mount Vernon, she was pregnant and late that year gave birth to a daughter. A short few weeks later, on December 14, General Washington was taken seriously ill and died. \n \n \n Clearly, Nelly was someone who knew the private and public life of her \"father\" very well. Therefore, Jared Sparks, in searching for information on Washington's religious habits, dispatched a letter to Nelly, asking if she knew for sure whether George Washington indeed was a Christian. Within a week, she had replied to Sparks, and Sparks included her letter in Volume XII of Washington's writings in the lengthy section on Washington's religious habits. Of that specific letter, Jared Sparks explained:\n \n I shall here insert a letter on this subject, written to me by a lady who lived twenty years in Washington's family and who was his adopted daughter, and the granddaughter of Mrs. Washington. The testimony it affords, and the hints it contains respecting the domestic habits of Washington, are interesting and valuable.\"\n \n Woodlawn, 26 February, 1833.\n \n Sir,\n I received your favor of the 20th instant last evening, and hasten to give you the information, which you desire.\n \n Truro [Episcopal] Parish is the one in which Mount Vernon, Pohick Church [the church where George Washington served as a vestryman], and Woodlawn [the home of Nelly and Lawrence Lewis] are situated. Fairfax Parish is now Alexandria. Before the Federal District was ceded to Congress, Alexandria was in Fairfax County. General Washington had a pew in Pohick Church, and one in Christ Church at Alexandria. He was very instrumental in establishing Pohick Church, and I believe subscribed [supported and contributed to] largely. His pew was near the pulpit. I have a perfect recollection of being there, before his election to the presidency, with him and my grandmother. It was a beautiful church, and had a large, respectable, and wealthy congregation, who were regular attendants.\n \n He attended the church at Alexandria when the weather and roads permitted a ride of ten miles [a one-way journey of 2-3 hours by horse or carriage]. In New York and Philadelphia he never omitted attendance at church in the morning, unless detained by indisposition [sickness]. The afternoon was spent in his own room at home; the evening with his family, and without company. Sometimes an old and intimate friend called to see us for an hour or two; but visiting and visitors were prohibited for that day [Sunday]. No one in church attended to the services with more reverential respect. My grandmother, who was eminently pious, never deviated from her early habits. She always knelt. The General, as was then the custom, stood during the devotional parts of the service. On communion Sundays, he left the church with me, after the blessing, and returned home, and we sent the carriage back for my grandmother.\n \n It was his custom to retire to his library at nine or ten o'clock where he remained an hour before he went to his chamber. He always rose before the sun and remained in his library until called to breakfast. I never witnessed his private devotions. I never inquired about them. I should have thought it the greatest heresy to doubt his firm belief in Christianity. His life, his writings, prove that he was a Christian. He was not one of those who act or pray, \"that they may be seen of men\" [Matthew 6:5]. He communed with his God in secret [Matthew 6:6]. \n \n My mother [Eleanor Calvert-Lewis] resided two years at Mount Vernon after her marriage [in 1774] with John Parke Custis, the only son of Mrs. Washington. I have heard her say that General Washington always received the sacrament with my grandmother before the revolution. When my aunt, Miss Custis [Martha's daughter] died suddenly at Mount Vernon, before they could realize the event [before they understood she was dead], he [General Washington] knelt by her and prayed most fervently, most affectingly, for her recovery. Of this I was assured by Judge [Bushrod] Washington's mother and other witnesses. \n \n He was a silent, thoughtful man. He spoke little generally; never of himself. I never heard him relate a single act of his life during the war. I have often seen him perfectly abstracted, his lips moving, but no sound was perceptible. I have sometimes made him laugh most heartily from sympathy with my joyous and extravagant spirits. I was, probably, one of the last persons on earth to whom he would have addressed serious conversation, particularly when he knew that I had the most perfect model of female excellence [Martha Washington] ever with me as my monitress, who acted the part of a tender and devoted parent, loving me as only a mother can love, and never extenuating [tolerating] or approving in me what she disapproved of others. She never omitted her private devotions, or her public duties; and she and her husband were so perfectly united and happy that he must have been a Christian. She had no doubts, no fears for him. After forty years of devoted affection and uninterrupted happiness, she resigned him without a murmur into the arms of his Savior and his God, with the assured hope of his eternal felicity [happiness in Heaven]. Is it necessary that any one should certify, \"General Washington avowed himself to me a believer in Christianity?\" As well may we question his patriotism, his heroic, disinterested devotion to his country. His mottos were, \"Deeds, not Words\"; and, \"For God and my Country.\"\n \n With sentiments of esteem,\n \n I am, Nelly Custis-Lewis\n \n George Washington's adopted daughter, having spent twenty years of her life in his presence, declared that one might as well question Washington's patriotism as question his Christianity. Certainly, no one questions his patriotism; so is it not rather ridiculous to question his Christianity? George Washington was a devout Episcopalian; and although as an Episcopalian he would not be classified as an outspoken and extrovert \"evangelical\" Founder as were Founding Fathers like Benjamin Rush, Roger Sherman, and Thomas McKean, nevertheless, being an Episcopalian makes George Washington no less of a Christian. Yet for the current revisionists who have made it their goal to assert that America was founded as a secular nation by secular individuals and that the only hope for America's longevity rests in her continued secularism, George Washington's faith must be sacrificed on the altar of their secularist agenda.\n \n http://www.wallbuilders.com/resources/search/detail.php?ResourceID=13\n \n \n Being in communion with the Anglican Church, and serving for over twenty-three years as a vestryman, and on at least three different occasions serving as a churchwarden, George Washington would have regularly recited the Apostle&#8217;s Creed, which begins:\n \n &#8220;I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord.&#8221; \n \n John Marshall, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who had previously fought with Washington in the Revolutionary War and served with him at Valley Forge, said of George Washington:\n \n &#8220;Without making ostentatious professions of religions, he was a sincere believer in the Christian faith, and a truly devout man.&#8221;",

Is it necessary that any one should certify, \"General Washington avowed himself to me a believer in Christianity?\" As well may we question his patriotism, his heroic, disinterested devotion to his country. His mottos were, \"Deeds, not Words\"; and, \"For God and my Country.\"\n \n With sentiments of esteem,\n \n I am, Nelly Custis-Lewis\n \n George Washington's adopted daughter, having spent twenty years of her life in his presence, declared that one might as well question Washington's patriotism as question his Christianity. Certainly, no one questions his patriotism; so is it not rather ridiculous to question his Christianity? George Washington was a devout Episcopalian; and although as an Episcopalian he would not be classified as an outspoken and extrovert \"evangelical\" Founder as were Founding Fathers like Benjamin Rush, Roger Sherman, and Thomas McKean, nevertheless, being an Episcopalian makes George Washington no less of a Christian. Yet for the current revisionists who have made it their goal to assert that America was founded as a secular nation by secular individuals and that the only hope for America's longevity rests in her continued secularism, George Washington's faith must be sacrificed on the altar of their secularist agenda.\n \n http://www.wallbuilders.com/resources/search/detail.php?ResourceID=13\n \n \n Being in communion with the Anglican Church, and serving for over twenty-three years as a vestryman, and on at least three different occasions serving as a churchwarden, George Washington would have regularly recited the Apostle's Creed, which begins:\n \n \"I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord.\" \n \n John Marshall, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who had previously fought with Washington in the Revolutionary War and served with him at Valley Forge, said of George Washington:\n \n \"Without making ostentatious professions of religions, he was a sincere believer in the Christian faith, and a truly devout man.\"\n\n \n Excellent post rider. If I might add my personal summarization to it I must add that America was founded by christians of various degrees of personal faith who were committed to creating a secular form of Government which never imposed any religious will or forced belief system upon its people. \n \n Atheists claim that they are not threatened by the concept of God yet they seek to even have any reference of Him removed from our money and public buildings. If the concept of God is no threat to them then why attempt to erase Him from the public psyche? And their ignorance of God causes them to fail to appreciate His promise that He will deny those who deny Him, in their time of need. Much is required of we who have received so much from our God who has blessed this American experiment from its very inception. \n \n Here is how the bible warns us who have received much spiritual light and will be held responsible for abandoning that light in favor of the spiritual darkness which secular humanism, atheism and naturalism is leading us toward.\n Luk 12:48 but the one who did not know {it,} and committed deeds worthy of a flogging, will receive but few. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required; and to whom they entrusted much, of him they will ask all the more.",

And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his Notice, is it probable that an Empire can rise without his Aid?

The following is a letter enshrined in the Valley Forge Historical Society and was used by permission:\n \n For another thought, the letter below was written by George Washington's adopted daughter (also his step-granddaughter) Eleanor (Nelly) Parke Custis Lewis. It was written in 1833 in response to author Jared Sparks [who compiled a set of Washington's Writings] request for info on Washington's religious beliefs for a book he was writing that was published under the title \"The Life of Washington\".\n \n Woodlawn, 26 February, 1833.\n \n Sir,\n \n I received your favor of the 20th instant last evening, and hastento give you the information, which you desire.\n \n Truro Parish is the one in which Mount Vernon, Pohick Church, and Woodlawn are situated. Fairfax Parish is now Alexandria. Before the Federal District was ceded to Congress, Alexandria was in Fairfax County. General Washington had a pew in Pohick Church, and one in Christ Church at Alexandria. He was very instrumental in establishing Pohick Church, and I believe subscribed largely. His pew was near the pulpit. I have a perfect recollection of being there, before his election to the presidency, with him and my grandmother. It was a beautiful church, and had a large, respectable, and wealthy congregation, who were regular attendants.\n \n He attended the church at Alexandria, when the weather and roads permitted a ride of ten miles. In New York and Philadelphia he never omitted attendance at church in the morning, unless detained by indisposition. The afternoon was spent in his own room at home; the evening with his family, and without company. Sometimes an old and intimate friend called to see us for an hour or two; but visiting and visitors were prohibited for that day.\n \n No one in church attended to the services with more reverential respect. My grandmother, who was eminently pious, never deviated from her early habits. She always knelt. The General, as was then the custom, stood during the devotional parts of the service. On communion Sundays, he left the church with me, after the blessing, and returned home, and we sent the carriage back for my grandmother.\n \n It was his custom to retire to his library at nine or ten o'clock, where he remained an hour before he went to his chamber. He always rose before the sun, and remained in his library until called to breakfasdt [sic]. I never witnessed his private devotions. I never inquired about them. I should have thought it the greatest heresy to doubt his firm belief in Christianity. His life, his writings, prove that he was a Christian. He was not one of those who act or pray, \"that they may be seen of men.\" He communed with his God in secret.\n \n There is more to the letter, however, I excerpted only that pertaining to subject at hand.",

He was like the watchmaker who created / wound up the universe and then sat back and didn&#8217;t involve himself further. \n \n And while Paine may have argued against &#8220;revealed religion,&#8221; many of the individuals who today classify Jefferson, Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and other founding fathers as strict &#8220;deists&#8221; have to contend with any number of quotations from these individuals, which to the contrary, show that they believed God did involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. \n \n Anyway, the U.S. Library of Congress confirms that &#8220;Deists in the United States never amounted to more than a small percentage of an evangelical population.&#8221; I think that puts it in its proper perspective.\nI agree wholeheartedly with the definition of Deism. \n. . . . . .show that they believed God did NOT involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. \n This statement alone present them as Deists. Their personal writings convince me they were not Christian but believed in a \"higher power\".",

I understand where you are coming from, but Easy and I are simply pointing out the obvious, not attempting to change the obvious into something it is not.\n \n Did you even read the letter I posted. The very best thing you can say here is that if all these men WERE Deists is that they were so under subterfuge as you know as well as I do that one cannot be a Congregationalist, for example, and be a Deist. Thus you are suggesting that all these men were liars, outwardly upstanding churchgoers during the day, but Deists when in private. \n \n Somehow, it will not surprise me if you agree with that.",

   "I agree wholeheartedly with the definition of Deism. This statement alone present them as Deists. Their personal writings convince me they were not Christian but believed in a \"higher power\".\n\n \n Not quite. The problem you now have - having agree to the definition - is that the vast majority of the Signers have quotations on record whereby they are either acknowledging the intervention of God in the affairs of men and/or nations, or they are acknowledging divine revelation.\n \n Franklin is an excellent example. \n \n Again, a true deist was one who believed God created the universe and then sat back and (1) did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations and, (2) did not give (divine) revelation to man. Franklin did not fit this mold. For instance, Franklin said the following during the Constitutional Convention: \n \n I've lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing Proofs I see of this Truth -That God governs in the Affairs of Men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his Notice, is it probable that an Empire can rise without his Aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that except the Lord build the House they labor in vain who build it. I firmly believe this, -and I also believe that without his concurring Aid, we shall succeed in this political Building no better than the Builders of Babel: We shall be divided by our little partial local interests; our Projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a Reproach and Bye word down to future Ages. \n Speech to the Constitutional Convention (June 28, 1787)\n \n It's pretty obvious that Franklin believed in a God who did involve himself in the affairs of men and nations, and Franklin also alludes to the New Testament as \"Sacred Writings\" which also reveal God's revelation to man. \n \n Will you now admit he did not meet the definition of a deist?",
