   "If by being born gay you mean that gays are locked into this lifestyle, then why does Paul clearly show that although many in Corinth were practicing these things, they were washed and sanctified by the blood of Christ and freed from the bondage these sins of the flesh had on people?\n 1Cr 6:9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals,\n 1Cr 6:10 nor thieves, nor {the} covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.\n 1Cr 6:11 Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.\n It doesn't sound like homosexuals or any of the other types of sinners mentioned above are beyond overcoming those sins that oppress so many. \n 1Cr 6:12 All things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by anything.\n He is actually saying that although it is lawful for believers to commit these sins, it isn't profitable. That to submit to these sins is to be mastered by them. And to be mastered by anything other than our God is to cheat ourselves of the riches available to us in Christ Jesus.\n 1Cor 6:13 Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will do away with both of them. Yet the body is not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body.\n 1Cr 6:14 Now God has not only raised the Lord, but will also raise us up through His power.\n 1Cr 6:15 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!\n 1Cr 6:16 Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body {with her?} For He says, \"THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.\"\n 1Cr 6:17 But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit {with Him.}1Cr 6:18 Flee immorality. Every {other} sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body.\n 1Cr 6:19 Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?\n 1Cr 6:20 For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.\n \n So how do you say that to be a homosexual is written in stone for people when they can be delivered from it like so many other types of sins according to the bible? I agree that we can't explain the origins of homosexuality, just as we can't explain why certain children grow up to be fornicators, adulterers, rapists and murderers. But I don't see anyone saying that they were all, universally born with the genes to predetermine those paths or lifestyles.",

   "I'll go further than that, and throw the question open to the board in general: Does anyone here NOT believe that Archie regularly \"spews vitriol and prejudice\" on this forum?\n\n \n Why must I say everything twice before even hoping to get my original point through to you people? Just because you interpret the light of Gods truth as vitriol and prejudice, that doesn't mean it will be judged to be that by a perfect, holy and righteous God. But the same wont be said for the hate and darkness that you constantly spew around here. Now I know you will interpret that statement as hateful, but it isn't hateful at all, it is simply the truth, which offends you so much. So I repeat what I said to foundit above...\n \n Once again foundit, When I stand before God and He sees that I have shared His truths with you, and He sees that you have taken great offense to His truths and that you attacked me for sharing those truths no matter how painful it was for me to say them, He won't punish me for shining His light on the darkness you spew and live by, but will condemn you for embracing that darkness and for hating His light.\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-20 is very relevant evidence to anyone who's interested in true and real deliverance from the sins of the flesh, and that it is truly available to all of us through Christ Jesus, our Lord. I am testifying as a first hand recipient of what Paul states in that passage and only someone who hates the light and embraces the darkness would dismiss and reject this truth out of hand. What you fail to understand foundit is that you judge and condemn yourself by your rejection of Gods light.\n \n Jhn 3:19 \n This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.\n Jhn 3:20 \n Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.\n Jhn 3:21 \n But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\"[fn8]\n So please don't accuse me of spewing vitriol and prejudice here when it is you who is feeling so uncomfortable due to being exposed to the light of Gods truth. It isn't my fault that you hate being exposed to His Light and interpret this great act of love on my part as something evil. If you truly loved God and His truths, you and your cohorts would interpret what I say as the eternal spiritual light that it surely is, and is intended as.",

But the fact is foundit, that I can and have given first hand accounts of such healings/deliverence having taken place today, from within the contemporary homosexual community. But in typical fashion you attacked a fellow homosexual just because he also said something you don't want to hear. Again, the light he shined upon your darkness offended you and you struck out at him and attacked him mercilessly, you and your fellow militants who hate the truth. \n \n But just because I'm so wonderful I'll repost his story for you. Just to see if maybe this time you don't read his testimony with a little more openness and respect since I have posted the passages from Paul 2000 years ago that explain that his experience is common when dealing with people who are sincerely seeking the truth. Here's an excerpt from his testimony. \n Homosexuality allows us to avoid digging deeper, through superficiality and lust-inspired attractions &#8211; at least, as long as it remains \"accepted\" by law. As a result, countless miss out on their truest self, their God-given Christ-self.\n \n Homosexuality, for me, began at age 13 and ended &#8211; once I \"cut myself off\" from outside influences and intensely focused on inner truth &#8211; when I discovered the depths of my God-given self at age 30.\n \n God is regarded as an enemy by many in the grip of homosexuality or other lustful behavior, because He reminds them of who and what they truly are meant to be. People caught in the act would rather stay \"blissfully ignorant\" by silencing truth and those who speak it, through antagonism, condemnation and calling them words like \"racist,\" \"insensitive,\" \"evil\" and \"discriminatory.\"\n \n Healing from the wounds caused by homosexuality is not easy &#8211; there's little obvious support. What support remains is shamed, ridiculed, silenced by rhetoric or made illegal by twisting of laws. I had to sift through my own embarrassment and the disapproving \"voices\" of all I'd ever known to find it. Part of the homosexual agenda is getting people to stop considering that conversion is even a viable question to be asked, let alone whether or not it works.\n \n In my experience, \"coming out\" from under the influence of the homosexual mindset was the most liberating, beautiful and astonishing thing I've ever experienced in my entire life.\n \n Lust takes us out of our bodies, \"attaching\" our psyche onto someone else's physical form. That's why homosexual sex &#8211; and all other lust-based sex &#8211; is never satisfactory: It's a neurotic process rather than a natural, normal one. Normal is normal &#8211; and has been called normal for a reason.\n \n Abnormal means \"that which hurts us, hurts normal.\" Homosexuality takes us out of our normal state, of being perfectly united in all things, and divides us, causing us to forever pine for an outside physical object that we can never possess. Homosexual people &#8211; like all people &#8211; yearn for the mythical true love, which does actually exist. The problem with homosexuality is that true love only comes when we have nothing preventing us from letting it shine forth from within. We cannot fully be ourselves when our minds are trapped in a cycle and group-mentality of sanctioned, protected and celebrated lust.\n \n God came to me when I was confused and lost, alone, afraid and upset. He told me &#8211; through prayer &#8211; that I had nothing at all to be afraid of, and that I was home; I just needed to do a little house cleaning in my mind.\n \n I believe that all people, intrinsically, know the truth. I believe that is why Christianity scares people so much. It reminds them of their conscience, which we all possess.\n \n Conscience tells us right from wrong and is a guide by which we can grow and become stronger and freer human beings. Healing from sin and ignorance is always possible, but the first thing anyone must do is get out of the mentalities that divide and conquer humanity.\n \n Sexual truth can be found, provided we're all willing and driven to accept that our culture sanctions behaviors that harm life. Guilt should be no reason to avoid the difficult questions.\n \n \"Homosexuality took almost 16 years of my life and compromised them with one lie or another, perpetuated through national media targeted at children.\"\n Homosexuality took almost 16 years of my life and compromised them with one lie or another, perpetuated through national media targeted at children. In European countries, homosexuality is considered so normal that grade-school children are being provided \"gay\" children's books as required reading in public schools.\n \n Poland, a country all-too familiar with the destruction of its people by outside influences, is bravely attempting to stop the European Union from indoctrinating its children with homosexual propaganda. In response, the European Union has called the prime minister of Poland \"repulsive.\"\n \n I was repulsive for quite some time; I am still dealing with all of my guilt.\n \n As a leader in the \"gay rights\" movement, I was given the opportunity to address the public many times. If I could take back some of the things I said, I would. Now I know that homosexuality is lust and pornography wrapped into one. I'll never let anybody try to convince me otherwise, no matter how slick their tongues or how sad their story. I have seen it. I know the truth.\n \n God gave us truth for a reason. It exists so we could be ourselves. It exists so we could share that perfect self with the world, to make the perfect world. These are not fanciful schemes or strange ideals &#8211; these are the Truth.\n \n Healing from the sins of the world will not happen in an instant; but, it will happen &#8211; if we don't pridefully block it. God wins in the end, in case you didn't know.\n http://www.massresistance.org/docs/events07/Michael_Glatze/index.html\n \n He sounds a lot like me huh? Here we have a leader from the gay community sounding like me, a religious nut according to you anti-christian militant homosexuals and atheists. Weird huh? Now tell me how he was ruined by people like me even though he say's himself that it all took place within him apart from all other people. It was just between him and God who comforted him in his time of sincere seeking for the truth. So call what I do vitriol and hate if you like but my words which convict you all to your souls are the closest thing any of you will come to Gods true love on this Earth, besides what Michael Glatze tells you.",

He was said to have an unnamed affliction, the devil allegedly had given him a \"thorn in his side\".\n\n \n Jake, I challenge you to find one theologically respected source to support anything you have said here. (#1)You people consider anyone who disagrees with your lifestyle as mentally ill. (#2) Paul was believed to be married as a member of the Sanhedrin, http://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/timeline1.html so why do you assume he hated the flesh and hated women? \nWas the Apostle Paul Married?\n The Bible does not definetively state what was Paul's marital status. However, the social norm of the time required Pharisees and members of the Sanhedrin to be married. As Paul was a Pharisee and likely a member of the Sanhedrin, he was almost certainly married at one point. If this is the case, Paul would have been a widower at the time of his ministry.\n (#3) His affliction, or thorn in his side was believed to be vision problems due to the brutal beatings he suffered because of his unapologetic teaching and preaching that he did in service to the Lord. Please get your facts right if your going to critique the bible.\n \n \nIt's been speculated that this thorn in the side was sexual impotence. This would explain why he was so loathing of things of the flesh. He was jealous of men who could sexually satisfy women, so he hated women. Bitter, angry, he wanted everyone to share in his misery.\n\n \n I'll bet you don't feel the slightest shame at all for writing this slanderous horse dung, do you jake. Again, rather than even repeat myself, I'll just challenge you to prove any of this fairy tale with any legitimate scriptural source at all. \n \n \nArchangel, the quote, from the guy in the the article he posted, all advance the idea that we humans should loathe our natural flesh.

You are blinded by your lust for the flesh and no amount of truth will break down the walls you have created unless you, like Michael Glatze did, open your heart to a truth that is greater than you are.

If I hated you lesz, i wouldn't be here sharing the gospel of Gods love for you while knowing how much you detest His truth and me for sharing it. I truly love you lesz and have shown it by telling you the truth. All you have offered me is bitterness and condemnation in return. But I understand that you have nothing more to offer than that so I forgive you. \n \n And I repeat what i have been saying lesz, we are all sinners whether gay or straight. And Jesus died for all of our sins equally. And when He raised from the dead He defeated death once and for all of us, if only we will receive that gift that was freely offered to us. That is the gospel I share with you. How you can interpret that as hatespeech or condemnation for you lies only within your twisted reasoning. I'm truly sorry that you find christianity so offensive. Here's the testimony of a gay man you should read with an open heart and mind. http://www.massresistance.org/docs/events07/Michael_Glatze/index.html",

   "You will learn one day that He was your Lord too snakespit, only you willfully rejected Him. You will understand clearly that He was there for you but you chose to enter eternity alone and on your own merits. If you had any idea what you are giving up, and how much you will regret this willful rejection of the living God someday, I dare say you would be haunted by the destruction that awaits you for the rest of this short lifetime. \n \n And I don't say this with any type of pride or joy snakespit; I say it with sorrow and mourning at how proud you are to reject eternal life with a loving God in favor of the willful ignorance you embrace with such determination. So please understand that's why I referred to Him as OUR Lord, because He is, only we can reject Him by an act of our will. \n \n What you will never understand is how fulfilling and joyful this life is for believers like me. I embrace and love my life so much. But all of the good things I have here don't even hold a candle to what I know awaits me in eternity which is when our eternal existence starts. Consider this life like the secondary womb which allows us to develop into the eternal being we will become when we receive our immortal bodies. You know the rest of the story so I wont bore you with the details of the path you have chosen.

Not \"religious bible studies on gays and what Archie believes based on those beliefs...\"\n \n And considering Archie can't respond on the scientific level, and the best he can give is repeating a \"you'll find out when you die\" or some redundant version of \"people thousands of years who thought slavery and misogyny were okay had this to say about the morality of homosexuality...\"\n It's time to explicitly demonstrate what Archie can't respond to.\n In volume, if necessary...\n \n \n f you grew up as a younger brother in a houseful of boys, you have probably lost count of the ways your big brothers shaped your life. Now a new study suggests that if you're also gay, they may have had a role in that too.\n \n Since the 1990s, many social psychologists have concluded that gays represent about 3% of all males-although that's a much debated figure. Others put it as low as 1% or as high as 10%. Those who subscribe to the 3% figure believe they have documented an interesting wrinkle: among boys with one older brother, the figure goes up to about 4%; two older brothers tick it up to 5%; and with three or more, it tops out at about 6%. What nobody could answer is, Why?\n \n Last week psychologist Anthony Bogaert of Brock University in Ontario, Canada, provided some clues from a study of 944 men. Some were raised with biological brothers or stepbrothers; others had biological brothers but were raised apart. In almost no case did homosexuality seem to correlate with stepbrothers living under the same roof. It was only the existence of older biological brothers-whether or not they were raised together-that influenced younger brothers' sexuality. \n http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1209914,00.html\n \n Another obvious indicator that GENETICS plays a part.\n After all, there is no rational reason why the influence would be different between genetic and step-brothers if there is no genetic influence.\n Science 101.

God doesn't care what our predominant sin is because unless it is covered by the blood of Christ it will keep us from His perfect love. \n \n \nRegarding the biblical condemnations, I believe God forgives all sins except denial of Jesus...certainly including being gay, if being gay is to be continued being called a sin.\n\n \n As I said above, I agree with this. Denying Jesus is rejecting Him and His Gospel. That also means refusing to repent of ones sins, which are forgivable if one turns away from them. That is the crux of the gospel. Assuming that's what you mean, then we agree completely. My problem with the homosexual community lies in the fact that unlike all other sinners who understand the concept of repentance, homosexuals seem to be demanding a special dispensation that say's that they can continue to do what God condemns as sin and still be forgiven. But as you know jim, the bible clearly say's that \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, not one is worthy, not even one.\" \n \n \nI have gay friends, gay acquaintances, gay co-workers and of course have heard of gay celebrities. Their gayness does not bother me one iota...and I expect to see most of them in Heaven, whether I recognize them or not.\n\n \n I do too, and neither does their gayness bother me jim. And if they have received the Lord according to His gospel, then they will surely be in heaven. But if you truly love them, then don't you dare whitewash the truth of the gospel or else you will just be enabling them into eternal separation from true salvation by telling them God compromises His principals which you should know He doesn't do with any of us.",

There has actually been research on bisexuals which shows that they are typically not attracted similarly to both genders. The attraction is typically towards one gender, and the other would probably be more along the lines of \"masturbation\".\n \n One indicator of \"sexual orientation\" that I have is what a person \"masturbates\" to.\n If they fantasize about the opposite gender, the same gender, or equally to both.\n \n \n \nI believe young straight people can be seduced by other straight people and other gay people as well. I believe that once a person has been introduced to extreme pleasure, that person welcomes a return of that pleasure and may habitually seek the affections of a same sex partner despite the fact that the person may not have been \"born gay\".\n It is not contrary to nature to seek or accept the actions required to orgasm.\n\n I guess I really don't see how that can effectively come into play.\n I know a few gay guys that started out \"being straight\" cause that was what was expected of them. Yet they knew they wanted something else.\n That desire was there regardless of how often they were with women.\n \n I guess one difficulty I have is why would a person seek out same-gender sex if what they really want is opposite-gender sex.\n It's like walking around with vanilla and chocolate ice cream as options, but they consistently choose one and not the other.\n Where is the logic in picking chocolate if really they are supposedly \"oriented\" towards vanilla?\n \n \n \nI say I believe these things because I do.

Some of my beliefs (regarding this) come from a clinical psychologist I count as a friend.\n\n Unfortunately, the rest of us don't have those accounts.\n But I can guess some questions that may be formulating from people, including myself...\n \n 1) How did those people \"consider\" themselves?\n 2) What gender did they typically seek out to have sexual relations with?\n 3) What were their actions/behavior when the other gender (possibly one they were supposedly really attracted to) is present?\n \n One thing you have to keep in mind is the power of denial.\n \"Gay\" still carries a fairly big stigma, and some people will declare that they are not \"gay\" despite the fact that their behavior may clearly contradict their claim.\n \n If gay is considered as \"uncool\" or \"not manly\" or \"effeminate\", and a guy thinks \"I screw guys, but I'm a good guy who likes sports and am not a sissy\", then he may very well ignore the actual DENOTATION of the sexual orientation and base his claims on his personal CONNOTATIONS.\n \n \n \nI don't recall the exact age at which I discovered the physical pleasures available through the penis, but I have found nothing to indicate that the pleasure center being stimulated makes any differentiation regarding who or what is causing the erection.\n\n I find that interesting.\n I have known guys who have dated and slept with girls before.

We live out our natural human sexuality. \"Lifestyle\", makes it sound as though it's not much more important than an interest or a hobby. You're dodging the issue anyway. The point was Paul had \"visions\" that today we would diagnose as mental illness.\n \n \n(#2) Paul was believed to be married as a member of the Sanhedrin, http://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/timeline1.html so why do you assume he hated the flesh and hated women? (#3) His affliction, or thorn in his side was believed to be vision problems due to the brutal beatings he suffered because of his unapologetic teaching and preaching that he did in service to the Lord. Please get your facts right if your going to critique the bible.\n\n \n Paul didn't say he was a member of the Sanhedrin, even if he was going along that general path, he may have been converted to Christianity before he was a member. Official documents, like the Mishna, which lists the requirement of marriage for rabbis and members of Sanhedrin, came after Paul. We don't know if the marriage requirement existed in Paul's time. Paul said he had the \"gift\" of celebacy(1 Corinthians 7:1-7).\n \n He doesn't state he was married, nor mention ever having a wife, and associates himself with the unmarried:\n \n (1Cor 7:8) Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am.\n \n (1Cor 7:1) Now for the matters you wrote about<b></b>: It is good for a man not to marry.\n \n We don't know what the thorn in the side was. He speaks of the women being below the man, and the man being below God. Of course there is much condemnation of sensual pleasures and the flesh, and you continue on that vein: \n \n \nIt would be a waste of time to repeat myself for the hundredth time and explain it once again to you, because you obviously aren't interested in the truth at all Jake. You are blinded by your lust for the flesh and no amount of truth will break down the walls you have created unless you, like Michael Glatze did, open your heart to a truth that is greater than you are. That is how every person who ever got saved, did it. By following God, not by leading Him around by their flesh.\n\n \n Sad, really. This is the crux of your argument.

   "http://www.slate.com/id/2194232/\nGay couples can't have biological kids together. So if homosexuality is genetic, why hasn't it died out?\n \n A study published last week in PLoS One tackles the question. It starts with four curious patterns. First, male homosexuality occurs at a low but stable frequency in a wide range of societies. Second, the female relatives of gay men produce children at a higher rate than other women do. Third, among these female relatives, those related to the gay man's mother produce children at a higher rate than do those related to his father. Fourth, among the man's male relatives, homosexuality is more common in those related to his mother than in those related to his father.\n \n Can genes account for these patterns? To find out, the authors posit several possible mechanisms and compute their effects over time. They conclude that only one theory fits the data. The theory is called \"sexually antagonistic selection.\" It holds that a gene can be reproductively harmful to one sex as long as it's helpful to the other. The gene for male homosexuality persists because it promotes-and is passed down through-high rates of procreation among gay men's mothers, sisters, and aunts.\n \n This theory doesn't account for female homosexuality, which another new study (reviewed in Human Nature last week) attributes to nongenetic factors. It also doesn't account for environmental or prenatal chemical factors in male homosexuality, such as the correlation between a man's probability of homosexuality and the number of boys previously gestated in his mother's womb. But it does explain the high similarity of sexual orientation between identical twins, as well as patterns of homosexuality in families. It's also plausible because sexually antagonistic selection has been found in other species. And many scientists who think environmental and prenatal factors influence homosexuality also believe that genes play a role.\n \n The authors note that according to their computations, the theory implies some testable predictions. One such prediction can be checked against existing data. The prediction is that on average, if you're a straight man, the reproductive pattern among your aunts will reverse the pattern seen among aunts of gay men. That is, your paternal aunts will produce children at a higher rate than your maternal aunts will. The authors check this prediction against the available data. Sure enough, it holds up.\n \n I don't know to what extent this theory will end up explaining male homosexuality. But its emergence threatens to change our thinking about gay men in several important ways.\n \n First, it implies natural limits to homosexuality. You don't need to worry that gay teachers or television characters will \"convert\" hordes of boys. Sexually antagonistic selection is self-limiting and impervious to postnatal cultural factors. The authors' computations show no scenario in which male homosexuality spreads throughout a population.\n \n Second, by the same token, you can't culturally eradicate the gay minority. It's sustained by genetics and natural selection.\n \n Third, if the authors are correct, we're not really talking about genes for homosexuality. We're talking about genes for \"androphilia,\" i.e., attraction to men. The importance of the genes lies in what they do not to men but to women, by increasing reproductive output so powerfully that these women compensate for the reduced output among their male relatives. You can't isolate gay men as a puzzle or problem anymore. You have to see them as part of a bigger, stronger, enduring phenomenon.\n \n Fourth, this larger phenomenon can't be dismissed as a disorder. The study's press release concludes that \"homosexuality should not be viewed as a detrimental trait (due to the reduced male fecundity it entails), but, rather, should be considered within the wider evolutionary framework of a characteristic with gender-specific benefits.\"\n \n Fifth, the benefits aren't really confined to women. They protect society as a whole. The authors' computations indicate that as a society's birthrate falls, female carriers of androphilic genes account for a larger share of the output. In short, the genes provide a \"buffer effect\" against extinction.\n \n The study's lead author, Andrea Camperio Ciani of the University of Padova, sees these ramifications as a happy ending. \"This is an example where the results of scientific research can have important social implications,\" he tells LiveScience. \"You have all this antagonism against homosexuality because they say it's against nature because it doesn't lead to reproduction. We found out this is not true because homosexuality is just one of the consequences of strategies for making females more fecund.\"\n \n But the word consequence suggests a sixth, less happy implication: How would gay men see themselves and be regarded in a society that understood their condition as a side effect of female evolution? Would male androphilia be treated like sickle-cell anemia-the unfortunate cost of a genetic mutation that's beneficial in other people? We medicate sickle-cell anemia. Would we medicate homosexuality?\n \n I don't know, and neither does Dr. Camperio Ciani. Science, like culture and politics, has its happy moments. But don't mistake them for endings.\n",

   "http://www.slate.com/id/2194232/\n\n \n Thanks for posting this article about an actual study which resulted in a model for homosexulaity. It's instructive to realise from subsequent posts that those who object to homosexuality simply ignored it! Par for the course.\n \n I think a couple of points from it could do with repetition:\n \n \nFirst, it implies natural limits to homosexuality. You don't need to worry that gay teachers or television characters will \"convert\" hordes of boys. Sexually antagonistic selection is self-limiting and impervious to postnatal cultural factors. The authors' computations show no scenario in which male homosexuality spreads throughout a population.\n \n Second, by the same token, you can't culturally eradicate the gay minority. It's sustained by genetics and natural selection.\n \n Third, if the authors are correct, we're not really talking about genes for homosexuality. We're talking about genes for \"androphilia,\" i.e., attraction to men. The importance of the genes lies in what they do not to men but to women, by increasing reproductive output so powerfully that these women compensate for the reduced output among their male relatives. You can't isolate gay men as a puzzle or problem anymore. You have to see them as part of a bigger, stronger, enduring phenomenon.\n \n Fourth, this larger phenomenon can't be dismissed as a disorder. The study's press release concludes that \"homosexuality should not be viewed as a detrimental trait (due to the reduced male fecundity it entails), but, rather, should be considered within the wider evolutionary framework of a characteristic with gender-specific benefits.\"\n \n Fifth, the benefits aren't really confined to women. They protect society as a whole. The authors' computations indicate that as a society's birthrate falls, female carriers of androphilic genes account for a larger share of the output. In short, the genes provide a \"buffer effect\" against extinction.\n\n \n One is tempted to respond, we're here, we're XXXXX, and you couldn't exist without us.",

   "Does that not seem to support the idea that sexual orientation may be affected by early environment?\n\n \n Yeah, pretty \"early\" environment. Uterine environment, in fact.\n \n \nWhere did you get the 1/3 increase in probability anyway?\n\n \n Here's an abstract:\n \n Fraternal birth order and the maternal immune hypothesis of male homosexuality.\n \n Horm Behav. 2001 Sep;40(2):105-14\n \n Blanchard R.\n Centre for Addiction and Mental Health-Clarke Site, Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, 250 College Street, Toronto, Ontario M5T 1R8, Canada. Ray_Blanchard@camh.net\n \n In men, sexual orientation correlates with an individual's number of older brothers, each additional older brother increasing the odds of homosexuality by approximately 33%. It has been hypothesized that this fraternal birth order effect reflects the progressive immunization of some mothers to Y-linked minor histocompatibility antigens (H-Y antigens) by each succeeding male fetus and the concomitantly increasing effects of such maternal immunization on the future sexual orientation of each succeeding male fetus. According to this hypothesis, anti-H-Y antibodies produced by the mother pass through the placental barrier to the fetus and affect aspects of sexual differentiation in the fetal brain. This explanation is consistent with a variety of evidence, including the apparent irrelevance of older sisters to the sexual orientation of later born males, the probable involvement of H-Y antigen in the development of sex-typical traits, and the detrimental effects of immunization of female mice to H-Y antigen on the reproductive performance of subsequent male offspring. The maternal immune hypothesis might also explain the recent finding that heterosexual males with older brothers weigh less at birth than heterosexual males with older sisters and homosexual males with older brothers weigh even less than heterosexual males with older brothers. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.\n \n PMID: 11534970 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n \nWhat if a boy has four older brothers? Is he automatically gay? Is the 1/3 additive or compounded?\n\n \n No, it's a statistical probability.\n \n \nThis is an interesting point, if what you say is true. I can imagine some changes in the mother's body, brought on by pregnancies, that could affect the next child. I have no idea how any mechanism manages to accomplish a change in the chemical makeup of the next son, but you seem to be saying there definitely is something going on there. Maybe the mother's production of various hormones affects the hormonal footprint of the growing fetus and being depleted of male hormones during the first pregnancy causes less male and more female hormones to be produced in the fetus of the second pregnancy, thus making feminine traits stronger in subsequent children.\n\n \n What he says is true. Hormonal and immune history might very well affect the course of subsequent pregnancies. This is an area of active research. See for example this reference in Wiki and the original references quoted within:\n Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation\n and\n Birth Order May Affect Homosexuality\n As you can see from the dates, this news has been around a while now. It's a hypothesis rather than an established fact, but it's plausible. It's still biological determination. It probably also doesn't account for all instances of male homosexuality, probably, I've read, about 1/7. Neither does it account for lesbians.\n \n Other factors involved may include the \"sexually antagonistic selection\" hypothesis mentioned earlier. Gays are just part of the natural environment. We aren't recruited. We don't choose.",

   "I also wonder if anyone has considered an epigenetic hypothesis for homosexuality. Maybe homosexuality isn't genetic per se, but is governed by how genes are expressed.\n \n For example, much of early embryonic development is known to be governed by the biochemical gradients established inside an ovum by the mother, long before conception. Also, males and females use genetic imprinting in sperm and ova to determine which genes will be expressed, when, and how much.\n \n It could be that sexual orientation is, in part, a consequence of genetic imprinting, or perhaps by pre-fertilisation maternal manipulation of the development of a fertilised egg.\n \n I don't really know if such hypotheses have been considered, let alone tested yet, but they can't be discounted a priori. There is no reason to suppose that adult sexual orientation, which seems to be established pre-natally for the most part (at least in males), should not be the consequences of several interacting biological processes: genetic, epigenetic, hormonal, immune, and god wot what else.\n \n Lesbians seem to be a little different, and there is no pressing reason to suppose that lesbians are made the same way gay men are, but it's telling that as usual, academic research tends to focus on attempts to explain male homosexuality.

   "But the issue at hand is the scientific evidence that gays are made the way they are.\n\n \n Yes, it is, but remember that even though gays are made naturally, that doesn't address the value question of whether being gay is good for an individual.\n \n Take, for example, the sexually antagonistic selection hypothesis posted earlier. It postulates that what we have is a \"gene for\" androphilia or fecundity in females, which has the additional effect of making some men gay. If this is correct, then it's easy to explain how it might have been selected for, why it persists in the population, and why it's better to have a few gay males than fewer productive females.\n \n However, this is, in essence, a form of group selection hypothesis -- it claims that having some homosexuals is good for the population because of the adjunct increase in fecundity. However, that doesn't mean that homosexuality is good for the affected male individual, nor does it mean that it shouldn't be expressed, treated or punished. That's a cultural decision, and not a biological one.\n \n An analogy is the gene that causes sickle cell anaemia. While it isn't really a \"gene for\" sickle cell anaemia -- it's more of a \"gene against\" malaria -- and although its existence is good for individuals in malaria zones, it is actually debilitating for individuals, which is why we seek treatment for it.\n \n I just point this out to counteract the view that having a natural explanation for diversity in human sexuality doesn't automatically mean that all expressions of sexuality are good. What is natural is not necessarily good, as though of us who correct our natural myopia with lenses know. We still have to make value judgements irrespective of our biology.\n \n Of course, this keeps the ball in the court of the bigots to demonstrate why being gay is bad for the individual. And spamming the board with bible verses as our Archie does in support of religious bigotry is not a very good answer.",

   "No kidding, because it's obvious that you're not looking at it as a fellow brother in Christ.\n \n \n \n This is why I go to church Matthew, but why would I ever expect you, a fellow brother in Christ allegedly, to understand it. 1Jo 1:7 but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.\n \n \n \n No Matthew, you just don't get it do you? To be saved by grace means it's a free gift, undeserved and given because He loves us. \n Eph 2:1 And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,\n Eph 2:2 in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.\n Eph 2:3 Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.\n Eph 2:4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,\n Eph 2:5 even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),\n Eph 2:6 and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly {places} in Christ Jesus,\n Eph 2:7 so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.\n Eph 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God;\n Eph 2:9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\n \n \n My relationship with my heavenly father isn't based on fear at all. But explaining that to you again is a waste of time as you will just make the same ignorant claim again next month, just as you did last month. And I've learned what your lutheran church teaches you Matt, and again, you have my condolences.\n\n \n I think Matt was genuinly looking for your beliefs in your own words, Archangel. You replied with sarcastic comments and Bible quotes. Although you said it's not based on fear. Yet, you've warned others in the past that what is waiting for them after death \"isn't pretty\", as a means to compel them to believe as you do.",

You're attempting to use it as a tool to convince people. Labelling it as \"saving\", doesn't change the logic or lack thereof, behind this fallacious, gimcrack strategy. However, as the highly religious, often say, they needn't follow any reason or logic, they have God. Well, that, I would suggest, is the problem. It allows them to say anything, and not examine it, or to even be honest about motivations. That's special pleading. \n \n \nAnd regarding the bible quotes; Matt is attempting to tell me how a righteous christian would act.

What way should I communicate my beliefs to you, Braille?\n\n \n Yes, but its basically saying blessed are the faithful. Matt would probably say he is faithful. There were some mentions of lusts of the flesh. However, on this I have asked you why this is necessarily wrong. Why should we start from the point where we dislike our flesh? Our flesh is beautiful. We can celebrate that and pursue it, without necessarily harming anyone. There are ways to harm someone in loving the flesh. Other arguments will make that determination.\n \n \nAnd here's my complete response to Matt that you quoted: http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=314290&postcount=118\n\n \n I've been pressed for time lately, busy with work.

But you all refuse to hear that and insist on accusing me of condemning gay people. But if I have said one thing over and over, it's that everyone can be saved, gays included if only you will repent and turn away from your predominant sins; just as straight sinners must do. No special exemption or special dispensation from God because He doesn't compromise with any of us, not even militant, stubborn, self centered and rebellious self professed gays. \n \n So your childish challenge is foolishness and a typical tactic designed to intimidate me. But it doesn't at all because I don't need my Pastor or anyone else to defend me as the bible I quote and the God I speak of is self evident. So the truth I share with you stands on its own merits. And let me explain how I know that my methodology is right, correct and working LA, if everything I said was luke warm and watered down like so much that other so called christians here offer, and if I never offended anyone at all but always compromised so as to never offend anyone, then I would be no better than the heathen and would have no impact on anyone here with the truth at all. The fact that you are convicted by my posts means that the Holy Spirit is reaching you. Your anger is the result of that conviction. The darkness rejecting and turning away from the blinding light of Gods truth.\n \n Like I said, God does not compromise His values, His principles or His holiness with His Creation, and neither can I if I'm more concerned with serving Him than I am with serving Man. And I assure you LA, I have no intention of serving the whims of sinful and fallen Man which we all are, the only difference between us is that I accept that reality; I acknowledge that truth, and I submit myself as a sinner to my Heavenly Father and receive the salvation so freely offered through the sacrifice of the Lord on Calvary's Cross. And yet you all love to accuse me of elevating myself somehow when only I admit my need for salvation as a sinner against a perfect and holy God. It is you all who stand defiant, insisting that you are good enough as you are. Can you even see the hypocrisy of your stance? I'll bet not. Not that you'll appreciate this, but this passage explains why I stand against your lies without apologies.\n \n Luk 6:22 \"Blessed are you when men hate you, and ostracize you, and insult you, and scorn your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of Man.\n Luk 6:23 \"Be glad in that day and leap {for joy,} for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For in the same way their fathers used to treat the prophets.\n \nI guess what I'm saying jason, is that it's a waste to speak any theology with you because you don't have a clue about any truth at all. You spew the same exact shallow drivel that I have debated a hundred times already with the other gay militants around here. You are an empty vessel with absolutely no core values to guide you by and I'm bored with attempting to reason with you.\n \n Sure you did, and you are motivated by hatred in that no matter how many times I tell you that it is sins of the flesh that God abhors, whether they be committed by straights or gays, all of you militant gays immediately attack me as a bigot as if I'm going after only gay sex and not all sexual aberrations equally. You are blind to the fact that sin is sin to God whether it be gay or straight. You insist that homosexuality is right and normal when that fly's in the face of everything that is scripturally sound.\n \n Insist that you disagree with the bible if you like, but don't say that the bible is unfairly attacking homosexuals because I have posted the passages that also condemn all the sins of the flesh committed by straight people also. In other words, where as I have been open, objective and fair in showing how the bible condemns sins of the flesh in general, you and yours have constantly lied and distorted my perspective by claiming I'm a homophobic bigot who just condemns gay people for the fun of it, or some ridiculous rationalization like that which is in fact totally motivated by hatred for the truth I represent. \n \n To summarize jason, you are lying about what I have said, you are lying about what the bible say's, you are lying to yourself about what is right and moral at every level of what is sexually acceptable in life, and nothing you say, no matter how loudly you insist on it, will you ever be right in your pro homosexual defense that all you are seeking is the pursuit of happiness. What you are in fact saying is that \"If it feels good, do it\" And screw the consequences. Well, you can only ignore morality for so long jason, and by me telling you something you have obviously never been told before, I am showing you the greatest act of love I can, and that is the truth that leads to eternal salvation. It's up to you to accept of reject it in the spirit in which it is given though. And I fear that you are already lost to Gods truth and committed to the lies of the enemy who seeks to destroy you.\n \n I am absolutely convinced that sharing this passage with you is the equivalent of casting pearls before swine, But I will make one last attempt to reach you where you live by getting past the flesh that you can't seem to see beyond.\n Eph 6:11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.\n Eph 6:12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual {forces} of wickedness in the heavenly {places.}\n Eph 6:13 Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.\n",

I feel more for you than I do for the lost, because they don't know the truth at all, but you claim to, yet even you can't understand that what I have said to them isn't a focus on the sin of homosexuality only, but on all sins of the flesh as I have quoted above.\n\n \n Yet it seems to be the issue of homosexual relationships that gets you the most riled. If you truly have faith in God, then you wouldn't be fretting over anyone's 'open rebellion.' If you truly believe that God will change their lives upon saving them, then what are you worried about? I think your greater emphasis on this issue of peoples' sin demonstrates a lack of faith in you, Archie. You say you believe in the holy Spirit; then let the Holy Spirit do its work. Do you actually think the Holy Spirit needs you to log into this forum every day and put people down and get into argument after argument with them? Do you not think it can do a work in peoples' hearts?",

But sadly you don't. It's about the denial by the gay community that they even have a spiritual need at all due to their active homosexuality that is the problem with them receiving the free gift of salvation. Now, regarding the bolded sentence, I'll let a scripture passage answer for me.\n  \n Rom 10:8 \n But what does it say? \"The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart\"[fn5] (that is, the word of faith which we preach):\n Rom 10:9 \n that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.\n Rom 10:10 \n For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\n Rom 10:11 \n For the Scripture says, \"Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.\"[fn6]\n Rom 10:12 \n For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.\n Rom 10:13 \n For \"whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved.\"[fn7]\n Rom 10:14 \n How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?\n Rom 10:15 \n And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written:\n \n \"How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace,[fn8]\n Who bring glad tidings of good things!\"[fn9]\n \n Rom 10:16 \n But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, \"LORD, who has believed our report?\"[fn10]\n Rom 10:17 \n So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\n \n \nYou say you believe in the holy Spirit; then let the Holy Spirit do its work. Do you actually think the Holy Spirit needs you to log into this forum every day and put people down and get into argument after argument with them? Do you not think it can do a work in peoples' hearts?\n\n \n The above passage answers this also jyoshu. And if you were really objective, or went back and read our exchanges with an open mind, you would see that my posts aren't condemning but are positive promises of God as reflected in the bible. It's the violent responses to them by those who are convicted by them that shows that the Holy Spirit is doing HIS, not ITS work. My question for you brother, is why can't you see that, and why are you unaware that the truth is the most loving expression of sharing that we can impart on each other? \n \n Tell me this jyoshu, did someone refer to you as a minister here a couple of weeks ago? Are you in full time ministry by any chance? If so, then I feel sorry for your flock if you are as lukewarm a minister as you appear to be here. I fully agree that if a homosexual accepts the Lord as they are then they will be saved, and God will work on the heart, convicting them personally regarding where and how they must change in order to live their maximum potential for Him. \n \n And I know by first hand experience how patient He is with us. But if you will again look back at my debates here, I have never gotten past explaining that all sin, straight or gay is offensive to our God, and they still don't get it. They still insist that they deserve a special dispensation for practicing homosexuality. That is the crux of the issue between us. So how is you ignoring what the passage above say's helping anyone? You see jyoshu, it is still the absolute truth that \"faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God\". So, which of us has been sharing the word of God jyoshu, and which of us has been offering lip service while making sure that nothing we say convicts or offends the hearer?\n \n Jhn 15:25 But [this happened] that the word might be fulfilled which is written in their law, 'They hated Me without a cause.'\n Jhn 17:14 I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.\n And tell me jyoshu, does this passage describe you, or me? \n  \n Jhn 15:18 \n \"If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you.\n Jhn 15:19 \n \"If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.\n Jhn 15:20 \n \"Remember the word that I said to you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they kept My word, they will keep yours also.\n Jhn 15:21 \n \"But all these things they will do to you for My name's sake, because they do not know Him who sent Me.\n What does it say about your testimony here if the truth you share doesn't even offend the unbeliever jyoshu? Who are you benefiting by offending nobody at all? Them whom you refuse to take a spiritual stand with, or yourself who is seeking acceptance and is more concerned with avoiding confrontation than sharing Gods truth with them? \n \n And how do you respond to militant gays like Matthew S who will respond to your luke warm compromise post with this statement? \nIt is only and opinion that it is a sin.\n He doesn't appreciate your compromise. He is determined to justify His sin. And you haven't responded to him yet because you don't really want to take a stand against his obvious spiritual rebellion. Who is to blame for that jyoshu?

If having sex with our partners is a \"sin\" in the eyes of your chosen deity, then you sin every time you have sex with yours, if you want to be consistent.

   "When it all gets boiled down, all you Christian apologists ever see or react to is the SIN of homosexuality. You never see the love or the humanity. You invariably think that the very act of having a loving, gay relationship is in itself sinful. Then you magnanimously say something along the lines of, \"But we are all sinners!\" as though that somehow exculpates you from irrational judgementalism.\n \n Sorry, but no we aren't, not in that way. Our sexual relationships are no more intrinsically sinful than yours. If having sex with our partners is a \"sin\" in the eyes of your chosen deity, then you sin every time you have sex with yours, if you want to be consistent. The notion that having a gay sexual relationship is necessarily sinful is a non-starter. That is not a socially responsible sort of religion, because it condemns us right at the foundations of our humanity.\n\n \n Apparently the you just flat out missed or ignored the \"if\" in what I wrote. I have no interest in debating with you whether it is a sin a not. That's why I said \"IF\" it's a sin, rather than \"since it's a sin.\" If you're confident in your position, it shouldn't matter to you that millions--or maybe billions--of people view it as a sin. It should be good enough for you that to you, it's not. I know you'd rather pick a fight over this, but I'm afraid you're going to have to be content with the fact that some of us just think there are far more important issues to be concerned about, regardless of whether THIS issue is a sin or not.",

   "Gay lifestyle dangerous \n Published: May 28, 2008 \n Paul Sikora (\"Anti-gay arguments spurious,\" Readers' Forum, May 27) shouldn't need the Bible to understand the dangers of the gay lifestyle. Statistics alone should confirm to any mature adult the necessity of protecting traditional marriage as the foundation of a healthy society. There are currently (worldwide) 30.8 million adults and 2.5 million children infected with the AIDS virus. In 2007, 2.5 million people became infected with AIDS. Some 420,000 children in that year were infected with the virus. In 2007, 2.1 million people died from AIDS. By the end of 2005, there were 15.2 million AIDS orphans worldwide.\n Statistics support the Bible's warning as well as that of modern prophets, that the gay lifestyle is a bad mistake. Legislation in favor of gay marriage legitimizes a lifestyle in the minds of gender-confused youths who need a clear message that it is wrong, that it causes misery, that it destroys life, and that it costs billions of medical dollars. We need legislation that promotes and rewards those who choose the lifestyle of marriage between one man and one woman, a lifestyle that has never caused any catastrophic disease.\n \n Marcia Ogden\n Provo\n\n \n The above is Archangel's posted article. Just in case it isn't common knowledge to almost everyone, most of the wordwide HIV/AIDS cases are heteorsexual. So the statistics prove nothing of course in his attempt to say homosexuality is dangerous. No causal link is established between heterosexuality or homosexuality and this virus.

It seems you only look at the times it deviated from what Christ taught rather than followed it, such as murders, unjust wars, etc. Those were times they weren't being Christian, not times that they were, because they are examples of actions that quite simply went against what Christ taught.

But to fixate on that--to let that get you hung up on a men/women equality/inequality thing is to miss a lot of the broader teaching there. I really do suggest reading the whole book rather than taking that one passage out of everything.\n\n \n So, is this a yes or a no on bible sexism?\n \n \nNo one is making you agree with that at face value to what it seems to say to you. But at least read the epistle and glean some good from it,\n\n \n Of course there is some good in the bible, however Christians conveniently follow the good and ignore the bad. Out of context or not, the bible says what it says.\n \n \n \nBut for what it's worth, plenty of families like living under the authority structure Paul described. They prefer it that way. That's their prerogative, and no one is making them do so.\n\n \n And thats ok, however it is not okay when the bible is pushed on other people, hurting them by doing so (I cite the many Christian churches trying to ban gay marriage).\n \n \n \nThe Catholic church was not around in the time of Sodom and Gomorrah by the way.\n\n \n Thats not my point. My point is that the pope condemns homosexuality, and being the leader of the catholic church, he speaks for the church as a whole.\n \n \nI only ask that you look at Christianity as a whole--all it's groups and its times past--including the humanitarian and aid efforts worldwide, before you pass any judgment.\n\n \n I do agree that Christianity has brought much good into the world, however many people believe the Christianity and its teaches are purely good, and that they contain no evil, when some, but not all of, Christianity's teachings are evil.\n \n \n \nIt seems you only look at the times it deviated from what Christ taught rather than followed it, such as murders, unjust wars, etc. Those were times they weren't being Christian, not times that they were, because they are examples of actions that quite simply went against what Christ taught.\n\n \n Oh boy, the moot \"real Christian\" argument.",

Hardly.\n \n \nThat others do is their problem, and something that you will have to take up with them.\n\n \n This avoids the issue, and since your first sentence doesn't make any sense, I think you are either being purposely disingenuous, or you are under some type of unfortunate delusion, perhaps the latter is deliberate too. \n \n \nAnd FWIW, I've known some very anti-gay people who weren't religious at all. It often stems from the simple fact that a.) gays are different, and b.) they don't want marriage redefined as a cultural institution. In these cases, religion is sometimes beside the point.\n\n \n That's why I said religion, particularly the monotheisms, and especially Christianity in the West, was \"a\" root cause, and not \"the\" root cause. Every point argued in the political arena in the West, against gay rights, comes from Christianity. \n \n \nRegardless, I'm simply saying that, sin or not in this case, there are much more important issues for Christianity to contend itself with. Poverty, war, intl. education, genocide around the world, homelessness, etc. I'm not saying it isn't a sin. I'm not saying it IS a sin. I'm saying that I don't CARE if it's a sin enough to warrant all we read here these days. Even from an evangelical standpoint, God takes sinners as they are. He doesn't expect some sea-change before being approachable. And with that given, I for one have faith that He can change a person's life if He wants to, but that's between God and the person. I don't think Archie has that kind of faith, because his focus seems much more on trying to convince people they are sinning rather than showing people the love of God and letting God do a work in their hearts. The role of the Holy Spirit is to convict sins, but it seems Archie would usurp that role.\n\n \n This just avoids the issue again. You don't see it.

We are not all equally recognized and respected in our full humanity, whether we are gay or straight. Heterosexuality is accepted as right, true, but homosexuality doesn't get the same treatment.

   "\n Well, are you just going to take a damned-if-you-do/damned-if you-don't approach here? There are theological views with all this in terms of why the OT law read the way it did, and if you really want to discuss that I will. But if you just don't like religion and are going to take a biased view against anything I say regardless with phrases like \"how convenient\", why not just come out and say so and save us both the trouble here?\n\n \n I'm just stating the obvious. You stealthily dodged my original question. The new testament and old testament are two books that say different things. So, which one was written by god? I am not taking a \"dammed-if-you-do dammed-if-you-don't\" approach here. God is. He gave us two books that say different things, which says that either he changed his mind or he didn't write the OT.",

Thats how it works.\n \n \n \nThat is a perversion of what the bible teaches at every level of its most basic message.

God does not tolerate sin, and neither should we of people we claim to love.\n\n \n If God made them \"sinners\" then sinners they shall be. If god did not intend for them to sin, he wouldn't have put the gay gene inside of a gay person's genetic makeup.\n \n \nSo if true christians tolerated homosexuality as if it's just a fine and dandy way of life, that wouldn't be loving you at all, but would be condemning you, and for that, my God would judge us harshly in that final day.\n\n \n According to Jyoshu, you're not a real Christian.

   "No one is saying you aren't doing what comes naturally to you. That's a different issue than whatever religion says about any given behavior of anyone. The reality is that religion says what it does, and you aren't going to rewrite religious texts.\n\n \n And what does your religion say? Heterosexuals live life being their natural selves, and that's good enough, but homosexuality is at least questionable, if not very bad. That part ought to be re-written or re-interpreted in my view, if your religion wants to treat people justly and affirm and celebrate the humanity of gay people, the way it does for straight people in heterosexuality. No, I won't be the one to do it, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be done, or it wouldn't be a good thing to do it.\n \n \nI'm sure there are things I do that some people out there don't approve of for whatever reason, but I'm not going to get bent out of shape over it.\n\n \n As a heterosexual, that's unlikely, or at least much less likely, than the other way around(for gay people). Gay Christians have their cross to bear(sorry for the bad pun), I'm not one of them, but it doesn't mean I approve of any exclusion or inequal treatment for gay people in any community. I don't support that.\n \n \nthe important thing is that people support your rights rather than approve of everything any of us do, and in fact I've heard numerous gay rights proponents say before they don't care if someone holds conservative religion's moralistic POV as long as their rights are not tampered with. After all, the constitution doesn't guarantee any of us the right to not be disagreed with.\n\n \n I wouldn't say I don't care. Like I said, it doesn't personally affect me or my life, but I know it is not a good situation for gay people in other communities. One situation is better than the other. Interfering with civil rights is worse.\n \n \nWho said it comes from atheism??? Of course it doesn't come from atheism. It comes from peoples' prejudices and intolerance of things different from them and because the Bible happens to take a moralistic approach to it, that's used to justify prejudice sometimes (which is a wrong approach of course).\n\n \n Uh-huh. Since this is just a moralistic stance in your view, and you don't care that others disagree with you, why not just come out with it, jyoshu? Say you believe it is a sin, or you don't believe it's a sin. Do you agree or disagree? It can't be both. You seem to be supporting the Christian side which says it's a sin, but you won't directly say this is what you believe.\n \n \nIt's too easy a target to just blame Christianity, which seems to be what you want to do. Some of your greatest allies are in Christianity, from Desmond Tutu to Mel White, and to just take a \"blame the Christians\" tact lets people off the hook too easily.\n\n \n When they exclude from equal treatment because they say their Christianity tells them it's a sin, then yes, I blame that Christianity. It was those Christians who proudly took the credit themselves.\n \n \n(Also, I guess we should now assume the ubiquitousness of Christianity is why gays are killed in theocreatically Islamic countries. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n No, I was speaking of the West.\n \n \nHeck, conservative fundie Christianity usually looks downright benevolent toward gays compared to a lot of Islam. But you don't even seem to care to mention that.)\n\n \n Earlier, I was critical of the monotheisms. Islam would be included in that. I could get in a discussion of the patriarchal, gender-role, warring tribal cultures these monotheisms were created to support. Anyway, at one point the Christians were burning gays. The fact that they're not, speaks to secularism, decreasing importance and questioning of religion, the acceptance of other ways of thinking as being equal to the main religion in the West, Christianity. However, those on the farthest right-wing who seem to want a Christian theocracy, well, what they want to do to gay people is very nasty.\n \n I don't consider Christians who don't want to kill me, are acting with benevolence towards me as a gay man, because other religious people are killing gays. That's a cheap and condescending comment, you wouldn't make to any other group. It suggests that because I am gay, I should have lower expectations. Heterosexuals will be accepted and celebrated in their full humanity, but isn't it great that at least I'm not being killed? As I said before, gay or straight, none of us are sinners. I don't believe in earning grace for being born and being human. I find such submission, flawed.",

No offense, but the moralistic issue is just not nearly as big a deal either way to me as it may be to you, and so I'm not going to spend time on that.\n \n What does concern me though is your irrational and unfair approach to Christianity. You're blaming the wrong thing. You should be blaming fundamentalism--after all it exists across multiple religions, and within all religions it's only the fundamentalist sects that cause the problems. And some of your greatest allies are from Christianity: Tutu, Mel White, Gene Robinson, etc.--a fact you still refuse to acknowledge, preferring instead to just blame Christianity as a religion rather than BAD Christianity.\n\n \n This is certainly not about firearms. It's been explained many times, and the heterosexuals who are completely accepting of gays understand the issue. This is our innate sexuality, an important part of our human nature, just as is the situation of heterosexuals and heterosexuality.\n \n We can quibble over terms. One may say it's disagreement, or say that it's wrong, but it's not hate, especially when my religion does it. Gay people can't be anything other than who we are, and our actions are an external representation of our innate sexual humanity(I'm speaking to Archangel here too). When you say you hate the acts(or attach some negative term or suggestion), it's very difficult or impossible to not have a chilling effect on the person and his or her place in society, on how we relate human to human. \n \n Putting forward the idea that homosexuality is wrong, whatever words are used, the context is negative, and no logical reason is given. This has a negative affect on the lives of gay people. Irrational responses of discrimination, and exclusion, follow. Family members don't support one another equally, people censor their lives in conversations out of fear. \n \n Do you think discrimination and inequal rights come as the result of people saying gay is good or right, putting a positive response to homosexuality, the way heterosexuality is deemed positive and celebrated daily? The notion that there is something somehow wrong, or less than, about being gay, or being \"openly\" gay, and the notion that we should lower our expectations to below those of straight people and what they have, makes it much more difficult to obtain gay rights. \n \n When people say their Christianity is why they have a negative approach to homosexuality(wrong, sinful, worthy of hate) , what am I supposed to say? They are not all fundamentalists, by any measure. It's true, there are a few fighting within their own churches, to end discrimination. They have a big fight in the largest Christian denominations of the world.",

   "It is often \"reinterpreted\". Nothing necessarily wrong with that. For most of us, this isn't nearly as monolithic of an issue as it is to you.

It is religiously inspired.\n \n It's fine to quote the Desmond Tutus and Mel Whites; they show that one doesn't have to be a bigot if one is a Christian. What they do not show is that Christianity rejects bigotry, or that Christianity isn't responsible for the persecution of gays. They do not show that the only way to be a Christian is to eschew bigotry.\n \n Whether Christians are good or bad people isn't determined by their scripture, which is flexible enough to be interpreted either way. However, what religion does is give bad Christians the imprimatur of their deity to be bad, and that is a tremendous empowerment and absolution for their sins.\n \n When bad Christians justify the evil they do by quoting scripture, it doesn't mean they are misinterpreting it or abusing it. They would argue it's the good Christians who are doing that. They are just seeing opposites side of the Christian coin. Alas, you don't get one side without the other, which is why I'd prefer to reject the Christian coin outright, and replace it with some better currency altogether.",

That's my business.\n\n \n You certainly can hold to any personal religious view that you want to, no doubt. So can we all. \n \n Here's the sticky part, though. I know quite a few Christians who say their faith calls on them to evangelize. For some, evangelizing means telling gay people that we are going to hell if we don't renounce our alleged \"sin\" and somehow turn heterosexual. \n \n I am most happy to let people practice their faith as they choose. But when they choose to stick their faith in my face in the form of this kind of evangelizing, I feel free to evangelize back to them. That's just free speech. Done respectfully, it can be valuable dialogue. \n \n Beyond that, many churches and religious bodies do seek to spread their religious beliefs into the public arena, and churches do take stands on hotly debated social issues. Indeed, the main opponents of equal treatment under the law for gay people are religious organizations, and they put a lot of money and organizing into trying to deny us equal treatment under the law. When religious institutions enter the public square, they are fair game for robust criticism. \n \n In another thread, you said the Supreme Court is not beyond reproach. Neither are the churches and religious organizations that push for laws that would deny equal rights to gay people. They should not be immune from criticism simply because they are religious institutions. If they are going to press for the passage of laws, then they cannot hide behind the frocks of the ministry or priesthood and claim that people must not criticize them. It's our duty as citizens to criticize them when they are wrong. \n \n I apply this standard to my own church as well. We are active in pushing for certain laws and for changes in the public arena, as part of our social justice work. For example, we gathered signatures on a referendum petitition that ended up successfully raising the minimum wage in Ohio. We are active in opposing the death penalty. Our church also works FOR same-sex marriage rights. We are not immune to criticism, and we expect it, as we are a socially active church body.

Maybe it's the same sort of thing with religious ideas.

All you claim here is that it's ok for the churches to do this, because if they didn't, someone else would. That's a pretty weak moral stance to take.\n \n And no, I'm not \"trying to get rid of Christianity\" -- I am bearing witness to its Dark side, which many Christians would prefer to ignore because it makes them uncomfortable. I far prefer a Christian who will couragously bear witness against the homophobia of his or her church, and seek to reform it. That's why I can admire Tutu, White and other openly gay Christians and their straight supporters for their moral courage to take a stand that is highly unpopular within their church.\n \n However, I disagree with the religious views of Robinson, White and Tutu, though I can respect them as honest and decent human beings worth listening to. They are not malicious, merely wrong about some things. They believe you can separate the Dark and Light sides of religious faith, whereas I believe they are irrevocably wedded together. It's not that every religious believer is going to manifest its Dark side, but that its Dark side will prove irresistably appealing to a substantial fraction of believers -- the Archies of the world.

I think no lower of anyone based on their actions--that doesn't mean I would do it myself if it goes against my personal religious beliefs. Are you yourself not capable of believing a given action that someone does is not something you personally agree with, without thinking lower of the person or looking down on them?\n\n \n Christians are not saying it's not something they would personally do, because they are not gay. They are saying acting gay is wrong. Yes, that is looking down on a person who is gay, for demonstrating the fact that one is gay.\n \n \nNo, no inference. I don't think those are the same thing. If someone tells me they don't think it's ok to engage in a heterosexual relationship--or any romantic relationships of any kind, I don't think of that as some affront to me personally. I simply take it for what it is: that their beliefs don't allow for romantic relationships between straight people. That's their business, and I'm not going to let it bother me.\n\n \n I don't believe you wouldn't take it personally. Any heterosexual person would ask: how can he or she act, if not straight? I believe it doesn't affect you or your rights, your place in society and how you are generally viewed. This is because there is a huge imbalance in power in favour of your group. What if you were part of a misunderstood minority, and you were given the message over and over your entire life, and had much less visibility and rights and social support than the majority who were gay? \n \n \nAnd please don't change approaches here and suddenly say \"but they lobby against gays and try to change laws, And they should keep their hands off the law.\" Yes, some do that, and you have a good argument there--I'm not saying that can't be resisted if you want to. That is an issue of infringing the rights of someone else, and therefore is a different issue in many ways. But this idea that we should tell people how to run their personal religion isn't right, either. You can tell them they shouldn't infringe on others if you want, of course. But I or anyone else can hold to any personal religious view that a given action is wrong if I darn well want to. That's my business.\n\n \n It doesn't happen in a vacuum, though. Certainly if they can tell us that how we express who we are in our humanity is wrong, that it's ok provided we don't show it; we can point out how irrational their thinking of lack of thinking, is. We have an interest in supporting, rational, logical thinking, because it's the irrational responses which hold back our rights, encourage discrimination, and negatively affect our place in society. When you say I can hold whatever view I want, and it's my business, that's the statement of a closed mind.",

   "Beyond that, many churches and religious bodies do seek to spread their religious beliefs into the public arena, and churches do take stands on hotly debated social issues. Indeed, the main opponents of equal treatment under the law for gay people are religious organizations, and they put a lot of money and organizing into trying to deny us equal treatment under the law. When religious institutions enter the public square, they are fair game for robust criticism. \n \n In another thread, you said the Supreme Court is not beyond reproach. Neither are the churches and religious organizations that push for laws that would deny equal rights to gay people. They should not be immune from criticism simply because they are religious institutions. If they are going to press for the passage of laws, then they cannot hide behind the frocks of the ministry or priesthood and claim that people must not criticize them. It's our duty as citizens to criticize them when they are wrong\n\n \n I think that's fine, and would never say that one should never criticize a church or religious group. But I think there's a major difference between opposing a church taking their stand and opposing the stand they are taking. The approach I often see here against churches is that they shouldn't take a stand on this at all. In other words, they should be a silent church. But we don't tell anyone else that. Part of the basis for that is that some seem to have a wide view of what constitutes hate speech when it comes to statements by churches and religious groups. But I think it is sometimes very difficult to determine what is hate speech and what is not, and I cannot accept that just having a religious moralistic view on something is a form of hate. My view is that we should let churches say what they want, but they indeed are open to having their statements refuted. I say let the court of public discourse run it's course, and let the chips fall where they may, rather than telling people they shouldn't give their views just because we find some of them offensive. So I have no problem with you or anyone else criticising churches, as long as it is dealing with their message and not telling them they should be a silent church.",

I have heard people like Les and me calling for churches to take a stand. \n \n Whether one labels speech as \"hate speech\" is irrelevant in the United States, as hate speech is legal and protected by the first amendment. So it matters not whether someone regards someone else's speech as \"hate speech.\" Only if speech is directly threatening does it risk running afoul of the law. \n \n I certainly support churches taking stands on moral and social issues, as I am the chair of our church social justice committee. Our church takes stands on a range of issues. We cannot, however, endorse candidates for political office, as that is prohibited to tax-exempt religious institutions.",

   "I think it is sometimes very difficult to determine what is hate speech and what is not, and I cannot accept that just having a religious moralistic view on something is a form of hate. My view is that we should let churches say what they want, but they indeed are open to having their statements refuted. I say let the court of public discourse run it's course, and let the chips fall where they may, rather than telling people they shouldn't give their views just because we find some of them offensive. So I have no problem with you or anyone else criticising churches, as long as it is dealing with their message and not telling them they should be a silent church.\n\n \n I'm afraid that you really can't get away with this simplistic argument. When Christian churches -- and this applies to the majority of them, including the mainstream sects -- argue that when gay people act on their love they are going to be condemned to hell in the afterlife, and should be punished in some way or another in this life, this is very much an expression of hatred. You cannot separate sin and sinner in this case, not without being disingenuous, because a need for love and intimacy is built into the core of almost all of us.\n \n I don't think anyone is arguing here for the muzzling of pious bigots -- that's just your attempt to change the subject from the church to its victims. Churches are as entitled to free speech as any other institution. But what you object to is having their beliefs described as hateful. They don't have any right or entitlement to be treated with respect -- they gave that away when they started attacking gay human beings for being who they are.\n \n Do you seriously think we would be waasting our time attacking Christian churches for preaching lies about gay people if we didn't know they were doing it? Do you seriously think we'd object that much to Christian churches, if they actually acted the way they claim their god taught them to act? No, we'd live quite happily with a decent, kinder and gentler Christianity. We might even admire it. It's because so many Christian churches have taken it on themselves to condemn their fellow human beings for acting on love, even when they act responsibly, that they earn the calumny they reap. \n \n As ye sow... or perhaps the advice to people who live by the sword...? When militant Christian churches act like vengeful warriors, they cannot expect to treated as angels.",

I want them to preach their hatred from their pulpits; I want to see them put it in the papers and on the air. Because only then will they be revealed for what they are, and the light will wither them.\n \n The are offensive, obnoxious and evil, but I'd rather they didn't hide their rhetoric or intentions under a smokescreen of false love. We have to know who our enemies are.\n \n The more insidious threat, however, comes from those churches that turn a blind eye to hatred, and tacitly support it by condemning gays in a more in sorrow than in anger style. They share the responsibility for the damage they cause, and have no right to expect to be free from criticism. Whether homophobia emanates from the Vatican or your local corner pulpit, it has no right to expect to be treated with hands-off respect.",

Protection of the law would be nice, not to mention protection for your willingness to serve in the military. I hope they fix these policies soon...\n\n \n Well in the case of what happened with the incident on the ship I was on I can describe it in detail maybe to give a better insight into why I am so adamant on the rights of gays and people in general. Mind you this is extremely painful for me to remeber and dwell on so it is very hard for me to type this.\n \n On december 28th 2007 I had returned from holiday stand down from california for 5 days. I spent a great christmas with my family and had just comissioned the navys newest warship the USS Mesa Verde only 3 weeks before. 6 months of hard toil from our crew to undue the damage and setbacks from katrina was a great toil upon our 500 man crew. We worked from 3 am to 8 at night monday through sunday and even on thanksgiving to get the ship qualified and inscected by Navsea. needless to say we passed with flying colors. \n \n Anyways, I was sleeping in my bottom rack and had to get up very early for duty section turnover. Mind you most of the crew was gone on new years stand down as half the crew got christmas the other half new years off. As a result I was the only person in the berthing at the time cause everyone else was on watch at the time. Then 4 of my shipmates came in reeking of alcohol and sluring and cursing and cause a riot. So I asked them to be quiet cause I had to get up the next day.\n \n next thing I knew I was being dragged feet first out of my rack on the cold hard deck of the ship. I was stood up and slammed against the lockers next to my bunk and held there by 2 guys. One went to keep a watch on the berthing door to make sure no one came in. The other proceeded to spew gay insults and racial remarks at me and then hit and kicked me multiple times in my gut legs, kneecaps, neck, face and forhead. At this time I thought I was going to die I was bloody and bruised and in pain. So my training kicked in and next thing I knew I saw red and broke free of the other 2 and lunged at my attacker. I we both slammed the deck and I hit him multiple times shattering his jaw in 3 places including his hinge joint but this at the time I didnt know. He screamed and finally the other 2 guys pulled me off of him as I was clawing at him like some kind of animal.\n \n Next my flight instict kicked in and I broke free again and bolted out the door to the next deck up to the master of arms office and told what happnened. 3 of the individuals were arrested the other who I hit spent a month in the infirmary drinking from a straw. Mind you I'm not a violent person what soeverand was shaking after what happened. So I was transfered off the ship to a shore command where now I am awaiting seperation from the Navy due to mental stress and fear of ever going back to a ship again. The four individuals were court mashalled and disonorably discharged with a hate crime and are now branded as felons.",

I honestly think if every group and person of Christianity out there suddenly became the most outspoken and ardent supporter of gay people to where that was their only priority, period, you'd still find a reason to find fault with them and not acknowledge their support. Why? Because you never seem to use the fact that most Christians out there NOW aren't on a politically anti-gay bandwagon and that some support you, as a factor in your view of Christianity at large. Why should anyone assume you'd start then? You act as though those who work politically against you is the whole religion rather than primarily some fundamentalist leaders who happen to have gotten a lot of press down through the years. You do this because you don't care to be accurate about it; you don't want to make the effort, else you would! And even after you've been explained this numerous times. The problem is the fundies. But you just don't seem to want to get that.\n \n Let me also add that if you think I was saying people shouldn't be described as hateful when they really are, you didn't read my post very well at all, or else flat out misrepresenting it.

It also allowed him to sidestep direct, uncomfortable questions regarding the anti-gay arguments raised, because they were those of \"some\" or \"many\" other people.\n \n When inevitably (and it was always inevitably) backed into a corner and pressed to explain and/or justify his own stance on these \"moral objections\" the other people (and most organized religions) had to homosexuality and same-sex marriage, however, he invariably claimed they were \"none of your business\" and refused to answer.",

   "I didnt tell anyone but they suspected it.\n\n This is entirely reasonable, and expectable for a variety of reasons...\n Obviously some of you will read the following and think \"Duh!\", cause you already know and realize this.\n But others like Archie obviously can't fathom how other people can think another person is \"gay\" without being told...\n \n I am gay. I joined the Navy as an officer.\n Inquiring minds wanted to know things about me and asked simple questions. \n Was I married? Did I have a girl-friend? What did I do when we went to Pattaya? Did I sleep with one of the local prostitutes? Why didn't I sleep with one of the local prostitutes? What sex stories do I have?\n yadda, yadda, yadda...\n \n This is real life here. Some of those questions are obviously a little \"racy\", but obviously there are watered down versions.\n A gay person has a few options to address this.\n 1) He can tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. He outs himself. He risks separation from the military.\n No matter how many of his fellow military members do not have a problem with it, all it takes is one person in the chain of command, or another peer with enough aggression to try to get him kicked out, and your job is gone.\n 2) He can lie. Invent a wife or a girl-friend or ___. Or possibly find a military lesbian and they can marry, providing each other with a cover story.\n 3) He can answer as much truth without explicitly outing himself. No, I'm not married. No, I don't have a girlfriend. No, I didn't hook up while we were in port. No, I'm not going to share my sexual history with you.\n Of course, such an approach provides separation from the person and his peers. And it doesn't stop the speculation. It doesn't stop follow on questions like \"why don't you have a girl-friend?\" \"Do you think that girl is hot?\" \"Why don't you go talk to her?\"\n \n There are plenty of gay people out there who want to serve their country, but catering to homophobes makes it difficult for them to show their patriotism. I got out when I realized that I could serve for close to 20 years, but risk losing my entire pension if anybody \"outed\" me.",

Oh, he may serve a purpose--as Admin apparently thinks he does, since he hasn't banned him, even for the most outrageous behavior I've seen on any forum--as representing an extreme example of across-the-board reactionary/religious opinions. \n \n And it is amusing to watch him pull his smoke-coming-out-the-ears Rumpelstiltskin routines and blatant projecting (to paraphrase Inigo Montoya, I don't think the term means what he thinks it means, he does it so frequently). \n \n But clearly he's more to be pitied than censured, as his pathetic screeching, name-calling, font manipulating, fact denying, self contradiction, and victim-card playing indicate. Even his handle... how \"humble.\" You got someone here with a cornucopia of complexes, not very bright, incapable of logical reasoning, and zero self-awareness. \n \n I asked him once if he thought he was giving a good account of himself here, and his response was \"????????????\" Well, of course. The only opinion he cares about here is his own. Otherwise, why would he come back here day after day, to be castigated and rationally rebutted in no uncertain terms by virtually everybody here (except his fellow wingnut Ethmi)? \n \n Would YOU continually log onto a forum where everyone easily tore your statements to smithereens, demonstrated with evidence that you were as ignorant as a post, and called you bigotted, hateful, etc.? Of course not. Because you've got all your marbles.\n \n Obviously, he LIKES the attention, NEEDS the attention, no matter how negative, to feed whatever neurosis or psychosis he's suffering from, which is why he says INCREASINGLY OUTRAGEOUS things to make us all keep it up, to keep feeding him, to keep giving him an excuse to try out new fonts and colors, and put more exclamation points at the ends of sentences.\n \n Sorry, but this guy is sick, and we're all enabling him. Admin clearly isn't going to ban him, so I strongly recommend to one and all that you put him on your Ignore list and JUST PRETEND HE'S NOT THERE.\n \n In time, lacking the attention, he'll just wither away.

   "Actually, yes, I suspect you probably would still attack Christian churches. \n \n \n Only to argue that their doctrines are false. I'd see no reason to be militant about it, had they not chosen to declare war on gay people in the 80s and 90s, when religious rhetoric began to turn really nasty as equal rights for gays moved closer to being a reality.\n \n \nI honestly think if every group and person of Christianity out there suddenly became the most outspoken and ardent supporter of gay people to where that was their only priority, period, you'd still find a reason to find fault with them and not acknowledge their support.\n\n \n Rubbish. I've never attacked the tiny handful of pro-gay Christian sects, and you know it. But I don't expect an apology for that from you.\n \n \n Why? Because you never seem to use the fact that most Christians out there NOW aren't on a politically anti-gay bandwagon and that some support you, as a factor in your view of Christianity at large.\n \n \n Most Christians probably just wish gays would go back into the closet, and stop being uppity. They are hardly supportive of equal rights, and it's silly of you to claim they are. However, a large hard core is actively homophobic, but you refuse to see that, quoting a tiny minority that supports gays as if they spoke for all of Christendom. They don't. They only speak for themselves.\n \n \nYou act as though those who work politically against you is the whole religion rather than primarily some fundamentalist leaders who happen to have gotten a lot of press down through the years.\n\n \n If I'd heard so much as a squeak of protest from mainstream churches against the excesses of fundamentalist Christian churches against gays, I'd be more impressed by that. Their silence suggests they aren't as upset by it as they should be.\n \n \n You do this because you don't care to be accurate about it; you don't want to make the effort, else you would! And even after you've been explained this numerous times. The problem is the fundies. But you just don't seem to want to get that.\n\n \n I am accurate: you turn a blind eye.\n \n \nLet me also add that if you think I was saying people shouldn't be described as hateful when they really are, you didn't read my post very well at all, or else flat out misrepresenting it. Perhaps Phyllis is right about you in the other thread I read.\n\n \n You and Phyllis are peas in a pod.",
