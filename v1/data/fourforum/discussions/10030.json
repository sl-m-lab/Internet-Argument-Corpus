You are correct - the Intelligent Design movement doesn't exactly reject evolution, but what I have always seen from people who claim to be IDers is that God created different animals \"as is\" and then they evolved from there. For example, he created the first \"birds\", and then they continued to diversify, rather than the acepted theory of evolution from dinosaurs. Stuff like that (same for the evolution of tetrapods, etc.) and the \"irreducible complexity\" argument (shown to be quite wrong) put forth by Michael Behe I think.\n \n Yes, you are correct, I do subscribe to a sort of \"intelligent design\" (in that evolution is God's tool for \"designing\"), just not what the movement itself claims to follow. And it is definitely NOT something that should be taught in the science classroom (it is my personal belief, nothing else)\n \n If you'd like to learn more about ID, here is a link to the testimony of Kevin Pandian (a paleontologist) in the Kitzmiller v. Dover (Penn.) case where they tried to get ID into the classroom. It examines the main \"textbook\" of Iders, Of Pandas and People, and gives numerous exerpts. Kevin Pandian Testimony - Kitzmiller v.

Revealed religion really does not supply the premises or prescriptions underlying morality which after all are only ethics.

Maybe science can eventually develop to the point where it can dispense with a separate First and Uncaused Cause.\n \n However, there is another major problem, that even if one were to grant a need for a FUC, which I don't think is essential, how does one rationally develop a theology from it? The answer, of course, is that it is never developed rationally, but as an origins mythology, or \"revealed truth\". But there is no reason to think a FUC would have any reason or desire to reveal truth to anyone. Still less that the FUC should have anthropomorphic traits.\n \n That's the problem with theology. No matter how internally true it is to its own logic, no matter how internally rational, it still has no real connection to the real world. It's a work of fiction crafted and developed by human minds, and it will never be more than this, no matter whose theology it is, an ayatollah's, the pope's or the Aztecs'.\n \n That's why, with hindsight, I think it such a pity Newton devoted so much of his time to theological problems, though obviously he lived in an era where that was expected. Theology has been called \"the Queen of the Sciences\", and no doubt Newton pursued his theological ruminations in that tradition. Unfortunately, Newton didn't realise that theology and science are antithetical, because they use completely different styles of reasoning. Science requires skepticism and testing, resting on a bed of empiricism, while theology rests on pure belief. Both may use reason, but only science can use reason to any effect.",

   "BTW, I do not claim that people who did and continue to study theology are fools, madmen or dishonest charlatans. I happily concede they thought and still think they are trying to answer some of the most puzzling questions the human mind has pondered, using the considerable power of human reason and imagination. I just happen to be one of those who thinks it amounts to little more than omphaloscopy. I think this because the power of reason alone is insufficient to understand nature: rational analysis needs to be tested empirically against the real world. And imagination needs to be tempered with reality if it is not to run away with someone's mind.\n \n I think the intention behind theology is a noble one, and perhaps that's where the title Queen of the Sciences came from.

If you want to debate scriptural explanations of origins, then anyone else is welcome to enter this discussion for that purpose. \n \n \nFine. Some religions have been as damaging in their time as some forms of Communism. There's not much difference in principle or practice between the KGB and the Inquisition, but Communism no more requires a KGB than Christianity required an Inquisition. There's nothing about it in Marx's writings. They are just examples of similar authoritarian thinking induced by blind and zealous devotion to an ideology. You have merely objected to the comparison for some unknown reason, but you haven't managed to demonstrate it has no validity whatever. \n\n I objected because, as you know perfectly well, Christianity is based on moral precepts that should not be confused with the \"ethics\", if any, of dialectical materialism. What's more, and it's tiresome to remind you, the Christian religion is not an ideology which provides a political and economic program for a totalitarian society - in which the ends justify the means. On the contrary, the teachings of Christ (adequately understood) promote a vision of human life in which love and peace are among its fundamental values.\n \n \nNot just that. Also logic and reasoned argument. I can also point to the differences between democratic secular governments and authoritarian theocratic ones. So I think I can make solid empirical claims for the philosophical superiority of at least some secular systems over religious ones.\n\n Your \"solid empirical claims\" could not be established by the quantified methods of science. Your claims would be nothing more than your private judgments based on a comparative study of secular and religious societies. No argument for any substantive philosophical conclusion is compelling to someone, philosophically informed, who finds the conclusion unintuitive. \n \n \nActually, I don't think that ALL thinking outside scientific enquiry is magical. For example, musical, literary and artistic taste are still pretty much outside it, but no magic is required for for that kind of thinking. Religious thinking is substantially if not entirely magical.\n\n All aesthetic judgments about art, literature, and music are philosophically discrete from scientific discourse.\n \n If the idea of God is absolutely irrational, why should the appearance of a celestial patriarch give the radical sceptic pause for thought?\n \n James.",

I haven't declared that I'm a Christian or said that I'm attached to any particular religious faith. And who cares whether you think you can indict Christianity (or any other religion) with your ignorant opinions?\n \nTorquemada, Beria, Torquemada, Beria... nope, can't see much difference.\n\n So that's your case, is it? Just a couple of names and an assertion. Why don't you admit you can't construct an argument that shows conclusively and without a scintilla of uncertainty, and with careful reference to beliefs and likely motive, that the behaviour of Beria was indistinguishable from Torquemada? \n \nYou think that beliefs you like need no justification??? Ha!\n\n Have you no sense of the conditional? Don't you understand that root propositions are unjustified starting points? My beliefs are immaterial to the matter.\n \n James.",

   "I guess at some point, you must have majored in Applied Tedium. You have failed to show that Christian moral philosophy makes any case for the ends justifying the means. You simply repeat the hackneyed charge that because some people, describing themselves as Christians, have behaved with savage cruelty - which nobody denies - they were acting in accordance with Christian principles. This is a form of proven guilty by association.\n\n \n Well frankly the Church (an earthly organization representing and composed of Christians) did burn people at the stake. If the primary organization which is representing Christians acts like that is not Christianity itself responsible? Christ has little to do with it you realize since the church long ago turned his teachings to their own ends.\n \n \nIf you think you can \"prove\" that Christian \"dictators\" are/were indistinguishable from Soviet Commissars, you must at the very minimum demonstrate that both sets of people were motivated by an informed understanding of the imperatives in their faiths - i.e. whether religious or political. So, go ahead; let's see your \"proof\".\n\n \n They were not indistinguishable, but they were equally guilty of murderous actions against innocent human beings.
