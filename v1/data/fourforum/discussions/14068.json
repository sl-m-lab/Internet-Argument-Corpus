I've heard Sharpton speak and he is a hypocrite and doesn't appear to be a good person from my personal experience. \n \n Really we should be so lucky to get socialism at this point. Here is an email I got which describes this so well: \n SOCIALISM\n You have 2 cows.\n You give one to your neighbour.\n \n COMMUNISM\n You have 2 cows.\n The State takes both and gives you some milk.\n \n FASCISM\n You have 2 cows.\n The State takes both and sells you some milk.\n In the case of health care, Obama is going to take our money and force us to buy insurance. Thanks! Insurance companies and drug companies bought it because it benefits them in the near term but like most corporations they look about one quarter ahead and thats it. I think long term they will be screwed over. \n \n Anyway, Socialism is just inefficient no growth or innovation and we all kind of live simply. This is not Obama's America. I think Facism is much much closer.\n \n Let's get the vocabulary right :)\n \n EDIT: After watching that video, I'm not sure that is what Sharpton was saying...seems out of context.",

I mean, people thought Hitler was the antichrist too.\n \n One of the states is Michigan, where I live. This is a very democratic state. Yet it hates this bill. A republican won in Mass.
