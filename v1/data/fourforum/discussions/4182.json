   "While the elections have been briefly talked about here,it easily deserves a thread of its enough.In my opinion,its unlikely the elections will represent democracy in Iraq.\n \n The first problem is the lack of info and the sheer size of canditates and partie in Iraq that thew people can vote for.There is currently a whopping 98 different entities(i.e.independents,parties etc).That basically adds up to 7000 people that the Iraqi people need to look up before they can vote for the entity that will best represent there ideals and values.The problem is obvious.How can the Iraqi problem vote properly with the current security problems in Iraq and when the information on canditates and parties amounts to this?\n \n Next is the head start that Shia parties and the current Iraqi officials have over the rest of the oppostition.Firstly the Shia parties and the current Iraqi officials have the advanage of being recognised by the Iraqi people through there current control of the Media.Obviously,with the massive choice of parties on the ballot,instant name recognition is a distinct help.Those appointed by the US years ago have grassroots organisations that the independents simply don't have.Most importantly,expatrite parties have the strong support of Iraqi voters who are voting from outside of Iraq.Once again the chance of those outside of Iraq knowing about parties outside of the big 3(United Iraqi Alliance,Iraqis party and the Kurdish alliance)are minimal,thus the expatrites will be strongly represented outside of the country.\n \n Finally,the lack of security in Sunni areas is bound to lead to a low turnout,which will significantly help the Shia.Many Sunni parties have rightly called for the election to be postponed-how acan a election take place when there is fighting like this?So with the elections over and a Shia majority,what will the Sunnis do?Will they hand over Kirkuk and its oil to the Kurds?Will the Sunni allow themselves to be even slightly controlled by the Shias?With this in mind the possiblity of a end to violence post election is unlikely,but the idea of a increasing of violence post election seems a woring possibility.\n \n So what does everyone else think?",

   "I don't think the elections are going to be anything close to \"democratic\" We were discussing this in the \"more news from Iraq\" thread. Apparently \"our guys\" (allawi and co) have monopolised the state run media, so nobody knows any of the other candiates on a wide scale.\n \n The polls I have seen show our guy loosing in every presict, but still winning th election since without nationwide media coverage for other canidates, there is virtually no chance of any otehr canidate getting his message across on a large enogh scale to be eelcted in anything but his local precinct. \n \n This is how we rigged the afghani elections.",
