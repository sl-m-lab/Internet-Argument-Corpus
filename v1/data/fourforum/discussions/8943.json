A rather costly and excessive solution if you ask me.\n \n \n Uniforms have also been a proactive approach to security, (this is ment for a bigger type of school, but like I said \"proactive\") This is an easy way to distinguish intruders from students;\n\n A 20 cent ID card could do the same, all while allowing students to maintain some individuality.\n \n \nalso reduce gang \"advertisment.\" Since a big things for gangs is to \"show there representation\" (by things like colors, and symbols.)

Not likely. \n \n Instead, why not go after these gang members and get them out of our schools? It would be harder to identify the gang memebers if we \"reduce gang advertisment\". \n \n It seems like some people just would rather believe in these type of blanket bandaid solutions rather than effect long term change. Covering a gang member with a navy blue uniform and a tie only makes him a well dressed gang member. Grabbing him and throwing him out of school on his duff makes him a gang member who is not going to bother a child in school where he should be learning, not cowering in fear of thugs.

I don't think kids these days fully appreciate why uniforms were introduced. My school is strict on the uniform code, but it doesn't deter anyone from being individual. Fortunately, here we can't have guns while we're so underage, and there's a series of trials to go through, and a bunch of agreements to sign, and for that you must be an adult (18 or over). And you have to be an adult to buy knives.\n \n \nAgreed. Its a complete violation of civil rights, at least in public schools. In elementary i had to wear uniforms, and all of teasing/bullying problems were 10 times worse than they are at my current school.\n \n I don't know why people here keep assuming that I want zero dress code. I do not. I merely want an acceptable common sense dress code (no, wearing odd pants and being forced to tuck your shirt in are NOT common sense nor reasonable).\n\n \n Technically, it's not a violation if the school has an out-of-uniform system. We get yellow cards (uniforms passes) if we have a reasonable excuse for not having uniform. This is in Australia, though, I don't know if it applies in other countries. If we were able to wear casual every day, there would be fights in the hundreds every day, mainly due to shallow girls who like to pick at other girls for the quality/style/cost of the clothing they wear, or where they bought it from.\n Mayhem a-plenty.\n \n There are two sites I found, but unfortunately I can't post them. For some ridiculous reason I have to have a post count of greater than ten.\n \n I think it's only private school that require ridiculous looking pants and tucked in shirts. I know my primary school asked for tucked in shirts, but only because we had class photos, not individuals like in my high school. It's reasonable enough for school photos, I guess.\n \n In actual fact, uniforms were introduced to abolish the need to separate the rich from poor, and in earlier years, white from black. I go to a public high school, and the uniforms are cheap enough that anyone can buy them. We do have a clothing pool for those who either can't find the right jumper (we have the freedom to buy our own plain grey or red jumpers/jackets/etc. Whoot.), pants, etc., which are given out or borrowed by students.\n One girl has two brothers who go to the same private school, and they have school blazers, hats, caps, socks, shoes, shorts, skirts and shirts. Hats tend to be around $50, while the clothing tends to be in the $200s, second-hand. Ha.\n \n \nUniforms also ruin a student's individuality, they pretty much extinguish any curiosity / creativity the child has.\n\n \n If you can be an individual in casual dress you can cope in uniform.\n On the other hand, some kids have a self-exploration period, eg. differing hair-styles, experimenting with clothes, etc., and that's a very important part of a teenager's life. And yes, that does cripple their individuality and creativity, which now bring me to understand how it extinguishes their curiousity.\n \n I'm really only replying to this because I came across it while researching for an in-class debate. But it's information someone might find useful.",

But I also wonder the same question but I started in the 2nd grade till the 12th. I didn't mind at all I really hated them but I wonder the same idea exept you just go against them unlike me who gos with them.",

   "\n Look, if you people want to wear uniforms, then by all means go ahead. But don't force us to because of your misconcieved opinions.\n \n And saying that all kids need uniforms to be disciplined (or something of the sort), or saying that all kids 10-18 think they're \"kings of the universe\", or saying that all kids make bad choices, is like saying all Blacks commit more crimes than whites, or like saying all Asians can't drive, or like saying that all Jews are cheap. You get the point. Its just a malicious and untrue stereotype. Even though a small group does something, doesn't make everyone similar the same way.\n\n \n Shooter, you are part of that age group and it's near impossible for you to see how wrong you are. I've been in your shoes, you haven't been in mine. A majority of kids, especially teenagers, need discipline, think they are always right, think they know better than everyone else, and make bad choices. It's not a malicious and untrue stereotype.

   "Wow maybe the concern should be what schools are doing if we think wrapping kids in the same package will fool them into thinking they are all the same, well at least between 8 & 3 M -F then the transformation occurs and suddenly difference happens. How about spending the money on educating and extra curricular activities. Maybe it wouldn't be necessary to dumb down tests so students do better. Maybe looking like everybody else will fool some of more intellectually challenged bullies who get confused as to which beanie wearing blue blazered dork is to part with his milk money, but only for so long and most kids get along or don't regardless of their attire. It does however help the necessary, but nobody wants to be lower middle class worker bee transition smoothly to the unfulfilled existence that awaits him or her.",
