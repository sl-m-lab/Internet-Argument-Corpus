   "Here we go again. Since there are clearly gay families in New Jersey with the new civil unions law, it only seems natural to include gay families in this video. What is the harm of knowing these families exist? Do the parents want their kids to be ignorant to such family structures? I also wonder on what grounds Garden State Equality would sue as is mentioned at the end of the article. \n \n You can see clips from the video at this website http://www.womedia.org/taf_clips.htm\n \n Article link http://365gay.com/Newscon07/09/090307video.htm\n \n \n(Marlton, New Jersey) A video used to teach junior school students about diverse families will no longer be shown after some parents mounted an aggressive campaign against if for including a depiction of same-sex couples.\n \n The Evesham Township School District, in southern New Jersey, voted 7-1 to discontinue using the video, \"That's A Family,\" because had so divided the community.\n \n The tape was shown last school year to third grade students at J. Howard Van Zant School. It included various types of parents and families - divorced, bilingual, mixed race, parents who have adopted, and step-parents.\n \n But it was the same-sex couple featured that angered parents.\n \n Parents opposed to the video began their campaign in January, shortly after it was first shown. \n \n At a stormy school district meeting earlier this year one parent suggested the Golden Rule - treat others as you would treat yourself - had nothing to do with homosexuality.\n \n \"Treat others as you would want to be treated, you don't have to teach all these horrible concepts to them about the golden rule, do you,\" the parent of one eight-year old screamed at the the school board.\n \n \"When does Evesham Township or any school have a right to show to my grandchildren something I believe to be morally wrong,\" asked another woman.\n \n That opposition continued to grow throughout the summer. This week, as the school district began preparations for the fall term, parents brought the issue to a boil.\n \n More than 200 people attended Thursday night's school district meeting.\n \n \"I look out here and see a community tearing itself apart,\" said board member Joseph Fisicaro Jr. \"It's obvious this video is a lightning rod.\"\n \n Among those in favor of the video were members of the Garden State Equality, New Jersey's largest LGBT civil rights organization.\n \n \"This saga is very far from over,\" said Steven Goldstein, the chair Garden State Equality.\n \n He said the organization is considering filing a lawsuit over the district's decision.\n \n New Jersey recognizes same-sex couples under its civil unions law, designed to give gay and lesbian couples the same rights as married couples.\n",

   "My family is not a family in the \"acceptable\" sense of the word to you??\n\n \n Of course it is. I said, quite clearly, that you and I both know it's true. Again, this is not about whether gay families are families of whether homosexuality is immoral. It's about whether schools should be able to pull material that lots of people (not necessarily you and I) feel is immoral.\n \n \nFamilies with gay parents and siblings exist. It is not a moral statement to say they exist and are a family. It's insulting for you to say that. \n\n \n Existing and whether they are legitimate families are not the same issue. Insulting or not, that's a common view out there. There's no sense sticking your head in the sand over it. Take it up with those who feel that way if that's the battle you want to wage. \n \n \nThe act of censoring itself is the moralistic behavior, not the topic. Deciding not to mention a fact because tight asses like you think they are so base that they shouldn't be mentioned in polite company is the moralistic behavior. Encouraging a certain behavior is different and you know it. \n\n \n Again, you miss the point. It's not the fact they exist, or even that they make up a family (in the sense of a group of people together) that is at issue. It's that to these parents, it moralistically isn't right to call that a family in the correct sense of the term. Again, you and I don't agree and we know better, but that's where they're coming from. You keep talking about this as if the problem is over the factual matters--it isn't. It's over how those facts are approached.\n \n \nThat polygamous families exist is a fact. That might be something that would be appropriate to mention in Utah.\n\n \n Ah, now we're getting somewhere in this discussion! So you would be perfectly fine with just mentioning such arrangements exist (when it comes to gays), with no value judgement of whether it's right or wrong? That's the way you'd approach polygamy families in Utah--right alongside other forms of families? And it's the way you'd approach gay ones, with no attempts to instill values that it's correct? You'd seriously leave it completely at a neutral point?",

I'd be married with or without the state.\n \n \nMarriage isn't only about benefits, it is also about intangibles such as social support and recognition.\n\n \n Then you terribly misunderstand the situation. And this only confirms my suspicion that some gay marriage proponents here think there's something magical about a having a marriage licensed. Getting a license from the state is NOT an automatic ticket to support and recognition from society. There are marriages that are state sanctioned that society deems ludicrous, and there are cases of marriage that society deems respectable that aren't state sanctioned. The two are NOT one and the same. \n \n \nHow would you determine that? Is it a poll of 50% plus one? The will that is holding back gay equality is prejudice. Sometimes the prejudice is open, sometimes it is hidden behind smoke and mirrors. It's waning, and with it opposition to gay marriage is decreasing.\n\n \n Prejudice or whatever else, it's still will of the people.

   "\n All \"marriage\" is, as far as the state is concerned is criteria for benefits. There's nothing magical about it--I don't get why it's supposedly so much more 'romantic' to have state-sanctioned marriage as opposed to what you claim to have already. I hear about these gay couples who, upon getting their marriage license (even though they've been united in what they call marriage for a long time), act as though it's the greatest day of their lives. Well, if getting piece of paper from the govt. is the greatest thing ever, some peoples' lives must be pretty damn mundane. And if they waited to get married UNTIL the piece of paper was available, then they must not have wanted to tie the knot too bad to begin with. If you want to get married, no one says you have to wait on the state to sanction it. There's nothing magical about that--if your relationships depends on getting those benefits, it ain't much of a relationship to begin with, to be frank. \n\n \n So much hypocrisy in that paragraph, I'm surprised your computer didn't blow up. I don't know how to address it all - but let's just suggest that we take away all your pieces of paper and let you and your family struggle through the obstacles that are created when it's missing, okay? \n \n My marriage to my husband was one of the greatest events in my life. The fact that MY government recognizes it, to the best of the state's ability, I think that's something. Sorry you don't see that. But, frankly, don't really care.\n \n \n \nAh, you not only want to change the institution of marriage for all of society, but you want to do it as defiantly as you can too! Well, hate to tell you this, but you're not going to get much sadistic glee from it over me, even if it does eventually happen. Because if society decides it wants it (rather than just a few who's doing it despite society), I'm much more inclined to be fine with it. My beef is with means here, and as long as the will of the people is not subverted, if that's what they decide, so be it. Geez, it ain't THAT big a deal to me.\n\n \n Odd, as a taxpayer, as a member of OUR SOCIETY, my marriage has already changed the institution for all of society.

Religion is chosen. Sexuality is not. States have already passed anti-gay amendements. Now they want the federal government to pass a amendment discriminating against 4-7% of amiercans who don't believe as they do. So, since there is a separation between church and state, why is this religious interpretation being given so much social and legal support? I have read comments (of which I'm deeply offended) as to the gay population being \"insignificant.\" (another politically motived word.) 4-7%, in my view, is hardly insignificant. Even if it was only 1%. Humans are not insignificant. As a anti-abortion proponant, I would hope you would agree with that. \n \n So, what more legal or social context do you desire? \n \n As I said, I don't care about marriage.
