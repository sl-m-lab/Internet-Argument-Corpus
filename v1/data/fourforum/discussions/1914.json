   " Many men, women and even children died in the witch scare that gripped\n Europe in the \"sixteenth and seventeenth\" centuries. In the face of the myth of satanic witchcraft, some genuine Satanists and even genuine witches arose.The most famous incident was the Black Mass scandal which rocked the court of Louis XIV and led to the arrest of more than three hundred persons. In the1670's, Madame LaVoisin, one of Louis XIV's mistresses, suspected she was losing Louis' affection and hired a priest to say Black Masses, hoping thereby to win back the king. Some of the masses included the killing of babies; some of the masses were offered on Madame LaVoisin's nude body. Louis imprisoned or banished the participants in the heinous affairs.\n  Contemporary witchcraft bears little resemblance to the witchcraft described in the literature of the witchcraft trials. Going beyond the medieval image, modern witches try to separate themselves from any connection with Satanism.  Rather than reacting to Christianity (i.e., being anti-Christians), they see themselves as an alternative faith (like Buddhism orIslam). As magicians, they have selected the old faiths of Europe with which to identify....http://www.holysmoke.org/wb/wb0331.htm",

   "To say that these accounts resemble modern day witches is laughable. The document written to justify the inquisition and the witch hunts is the \"Malleus Malificorum\" or \"Witches' Hammer\". Historians largely regard the contents of this text to be fictions. Yet the \"Malleus Malificorum\" was used as a manual for witch hunters. Most of our Holly Wood ideas about Satanists and witches come form this book. In reality Wicca was created by Gerald Gardner after World War II. Contrary to his claims Wicca was created by Gardner not passed down through generations of \"real\" witches. There is decent evidence that shows that Aleister Crowley may have written parts of what became Wicca or assisted Gardner in some way. That is another story altogether. In reality the \"Malleus Malificorum\" was merely a tool used to justify the persecution of political enemies and undesirable persons. \n \n There is debate among Neo-pagans about whether or not there should be a memorial for the victims of the \"burning times\". Some say yes. Some say no. As a neo-pagan I agree with those who say \"no\". The \"burning times\" were not about the persecution of witches, pagans, and Satanists but rather about the persecution of political enemies, women and other undesirable members of society. A memorial to the \"burning times\" only perpetuates negative stereotypes about neo-pagans. To have a memorial is to say that the \"Malleus Malificorum\" is factual, when in fact it is a fiction.",

Mendez is another spelling of Mendes, a city of ancient Egypt where fertility worship of Baal was practiced.\n The Goat was first developed by the Chaldeans, or as they are commonly known; Babylonians. It represents the astrological sign of Capricorn; Dec. 22 to January 22. Capricorn is a combination of both a goat and and a fish. According to J.E.. Cirlot in his Dictionary of Symbols; this dual aspect refers to the dual tendencies of life towards the abyss (satan comes up from what?)\" or chaos of the beginning of time, as symbolized by the goat aspect.\" (My note: Now if you looked up the god chaos, you will also find him to be a horned god). The \"christian\" fish symbol is not of christian origins and is the sign of the goddess (venus, 'mother (of the) goddess' of Diana). So when venus aligns with capricorn, it forms the god of chaos. Do I believe in astrology? Yes. Do I touch it, NO NO NO NO. It is satan's bible and time-line and it is WICKED. It is linked to all the pagan gods (and their names) and the time lines of the end.

Probably the best known Pagan religion.\n \n Satanism- A reactionary religion against Christianity. Incorporating both Pagan and Christian aspects.

   "Baphomet is the Absolute in symbolic form. Baphomet is all things cosmic, elemental, and mental. Different parts of his body represent different things. Its head; Fire, its wings; Air, its legs; Earth, it's scales; Water, and the candle on it's head; the vital flame. Baphomet represents both sexes (male and female, thus the body of man and women), Baphomet represents birds (wings), Fish (scales), and beast (head). To Baphomet's sides are the black moon and the white moon, of positive and negative forces. Baphomet is many things, but everything in one. Baphomet is also recognized as the Greek God Pan, the god of lust, and Nature.\n \n Satan represents the indulgences of man, the rebellion of past faiths, and the need to do what one wants. Satan, the universal rebel, the perfect rolemodel. Satan long feared as \"evil\", but \"evil\" is what is necessary in order to live a full life to one's desires, without guilt, without \"divine\" punishment. Satan represents mans carnal desires, Satan is Nature, the Force of Darkness. Satan is a Force of Nature, pre-Christian in this sense, not a fallen angel, but simply a Force of Nature. Satan is also symbolic of fire. \n \n \n \n The Satanagrammaton \n \n Fire: Energy\n \n Fire is Satan. Satan in Hebrew means the adversary and accuser. Satan represents Fire on the elemental level of existence. Fire is all that consumes, Fire is the Will of the Satanist and Black Magickian. The Elemental weapon for Satan is the Wand and his direction is in the south. On the cosmic level Fire represents all forms of Energy. Its essence is Male in nature. \n \n \n Water: Time\n \n Water is the serpent Leviathan. Leviathan in Hebrew means serpent or dragon. Leviathan represents water on the elemental level of existence. Water is the all-encompassing fuel of life, which conforms to all shapes; water is the Understanding of the Satanist and Black Magickian. The elemental weapon for Leviathan is the Cup or Chalice and its direction is in the west. On the Cosmic level Water represents all forms of Time. Its essence is Female in Nature. \n \n \n Air: Space\n \n Air is Lucifer. Lucifer is the morning star and the enlightened one. Lucifer represents air on the elemental level of existence. Air is the breath of life and all open spaces of existence; air is the reasoning and enlightenment of the Satanist and Black magickian. The elemental weapon for air is the sword or dagger and its direction is in the east. On the cosmic level Air is Space and all that is in between matter. Its essence is Male in nature \n \n \n Earth: Mass\n \n Earth is Belial. Belial means \"without God\" in Hebrew. Belial represents earth on the elemental level of existence. Earth is the foundation of life, the Body, all that is solid and of matter. Earth is the Body and physical essence of the Satanist and Black magickian. The elemental weapon of Earth is the disk or shield and its direction is in the north. On the Cosmic level earth is Mass and all that is Matter in the Universe. Its essence is female in nature. \n \n \n In between and over-lapping the Cosmic and elemental: Conscious beings\n \n The fifth aspect or element being the Black Flame of Vital \"Fire\", this is the element which holds all of the above together, this element or force is represented by Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the Black Flame. This is that which is above in the cosmic level and that which is below in the elemental levels made one in man, the medium of existence made into and manifesting as consciousness in all beings. This area of \"in-betweeness\" of the Cosmic, Mental and elemental realm it is the home of all harmonious and conflicting forces in there infinite dual aspects. http://www.dtobaphomet.org/about.html\n \n \n Baphomet\n \n \"This symbol was created by one of the foremost Satanists and Freemasons of all time, Eliphas Levi. Over the centuries, it has been recognized as one of the most evil of all symbols. As you look closely at Baphomet, you will see the emphasis is on sex, as this Being is androgynous -- both male and female -- you can see it has the breasts of a woman, and an erect phallus. In fact, two serpents are shown coiled around the erect phallus, a phallus that looks suspiciously large. ( And Jesus said, \"You are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do\"). This Being has the head of the \"Horned Goat\" another title for Satan. In the book, Masonic and Occult Symbols Illustrated, Dr. Burns says, \"In a book on witchcraft, The Complete Book of Witchcraft and Demonology ... the caption states that he is 'the horned god of the witches, symbol of sex incarnate'.\" [p. 51] If you look carefully, you will see Baphomet making the sign of the Devil's triad with his right hand. \"Baphomet is also known as the Sabbatic goat, in whose form Satan is to be worshiped at the Witches' Sabbath\". [Frank Gaynor, Dictionary of Mysticism, New York, Philosophical Library, 1953, p. 24] \n It is not surprising that the antichrist will have no desire for women (Daniel 11:37-38). And in his estate he shall worship the god of \"forces\" (Earth, wind and fire) as do witches. \"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n See any difference between the Wiccans( witches) and Satanist views of the Baphomet/ and the relation to nature..",

To quote from Iron Liche's religious tolerance website:\n \n \n \nSatan in his original pre-Christian Pagan forms is respected, as a principle rather than a deity. Satanists do not worship Satan just as most Buddhists do not worship Buddha.\" As Vexen Crabtree has written: \n \"Satanism is Satanism not due to our worship of any deity, but for the philosophy that we stand for. We recognize ourselves as gods, and we hold our own perspective on life as holy and revere our own experiences as the only truth we can ever know. \"\n \"Satanism is the utter rejection of the spiritual way of theistic religions, and the honest admittence [sic] that we are just animals who evolve as any other complex system.\"\n\n And from The Church of Satan Information Pack:\n \n \n \nThere are no elements of Devil worship in the Church of Satan. Such practices are looked upon as being Christian heresies; believing in the dualistic Christian worldview of 'God vs the Devil' and choosing to side with the Prince of Darkness. Satanists do not believe in the Supernatural, in neither God nor the Devil. To the Satanist, he is his own God. Satan is a symbol of Man living as his prideful, carnal nature dictates. The reality behind Satan is simply the dark evolutionary force that permeates all of nature and provides the drive for survival and propagation inherent in all living things. Satan is not a conscious entity to be worshipped, rather a reservoir of power inside each human to be tapped at will.\n\n So you see Satanists really don't believe in Satan or the Bible. It is a fact often confused or ignored, but it is true.\n \n \n \nI never said they were the same. \n \n I know, sorry that comment wasn't meant to be directed at you.\n \n \n \nDevil worshipers cannot be christians. the main similarity is that they both believe the bible.\n\n Yes you are right.

To quote from Iron Liche's religious tolerance website:\n \n So you see Satanists really don't believe in Satan or the Bible. It is a fact often confused or ignored, but it is true.\n\n fair enough, although its obviously misleading. I'll have to look this up some more, because its a bit difficult for me to grasp that a sect of people who call themselves Satanist are completely unaffiliated with Satan.\n \n but, since both Satanists and Wiccans may practice witchcraft, and both (apparently) dont believe in Satan, God or the bible, what is the difference between a Satanist and a Wiccan? can they be the same?",

   "Yes, I agree it is misleading. It is not so much that they are completely unaffiliated, but that they define it in a different term. After all isn't the ultimate rejection of God not only a rejection of him but his definitions and worldview?\n \n \n \nbut, since both Satanists and Wiccans may practice witchcraft, and both (apparently) dont believe in Satan, God or the bible, what is the difference between a Satanist and a Wiccan? can they be the same?\n\n As far as I know Bhuddists can practice magic, and they dont believe in Satan, God or the bible. But that does not mean they are no different to a Satanist or a Wiccan. These religions all have core teachings and beliefs that are very different. For example:\n \n Wiccans are generally polytheist, Satanists generally atheist.\n Satanists believe in rule of the strong, Wiccans don't.\n Whilst respecting nature, Satanists believe power comes from the individual.\n Wiccans believe in light and dark magic, Satanists see it as the same.\n \n And many more. Plus the fact that both groups hate to be associated with each other. They may share similar superficial appearances, but are very different.",
