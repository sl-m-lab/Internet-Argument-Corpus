   "This is supposed to be sarcastic, but really it's the way it is.\n \n http://craptaculus.com/eac/ID/id-faq.shtml\n \n \n\n What is Intelligent Design?\n \n * Intelligent Design (ID) is a scientific theory that says evolution's naturalism is wrong: an Intelligent Designer is responsible for the origin of the universe and of life and its diversity.\n \n \n Isn't the \"Intelligent Designer\" just another way of saying \"God\"?\n \n * Of course not. The Intelligent Designer could be advanced aliens or the Christian God. We don't say which.\n \n \n If it could be either aliens or God, why does your logo show the Christian God?\n \n * We had to pick one or the other, and it just happened to be that\n one. We definitely don't rule aliens out. We even have an alternate version of our logo in case that turns out to be the case:\n \n \n Do you really believe it could be aliens?\n \n * No.\n \n \n Is Intelligent Design scientific?\n \n * Yes, didn't you see that we italicized scientific all over the place?\n \n \n How do you recognize when something is designed?\n \n * Something is designed when it is really complex, has Irreducible Complexity, or looks like it's designed.\n \n \n What is Irreducible Complexity?\n \n * Irreducible Complexity means that something requires all its parts in order to function, so therefore it couldn't have possibly evolved.\n \n \n How do you recognize when something is Irreducibly Complex?\n \n * Something is Irreducibly Complex when proponents of Intelligent Design can't imagine how natural selection could have produced it.\n \n \n Does natural selection ever work?\n \n * Sometimes maybe, but not when we can't imagine it working.\n \n \n What does it mean when something seems unintelligently designed?\n \n * It means it wasn't designed, or we weren't meant to understand the design.\n \n \n What is the agenda of the Intelligent Design Society of Kansas?\n \n * We want schools to teach the evidence against evolution and that alternatives to evolution exist, such as Intelligent design.\n \n \n Should schools teach the evidence against Intelligent Design, or an Intelligent Designer?\n \n * No, that would violate the religious freedoms of the children.\n \n \n How old is the earth?\n \n * Somewhere between six thousand and 5 billion years.\n \n \n When did the Designer do the designing?\n \n * That's not something we can answer, it's more of a philosophical question.\n \n \n How did the Designer do the designing?\n \n * Again, this is more of a philosophical question, so we can't say.\n \n \n Is the Designer still designing?\n \n * Philosophical.\n \n \n Is there anything Intelligent Design tells us about the Designer?\n \n * Yes, Intelligent Design says there is an Intelligent Design and an Intelligent Designer.\n \n \n Isn't Intelligent Design just Creationism?\n \n * Definitely not. Creationism says that an Intelligent Creator created life. Intelligent Design says that an Intelligent Designer designed life. And just because most of our proponents are creationists, promote creationism, and do not understand any part of the theory of evolution or even Intelligent Design does not mean we are promoting Creationism.\n \n \n Are scientists leaving evolution for Intelligent Design?\n \n * Yes, by the boatload! Every year dozens of scientists in fields such as computer science, engineering, and pastry science have doubts about the validity of Evolution!.\n . . . . \n \n \n What is directed evolution?\n \n * That's what some of us believe is responsible for the instances where it looks like evolution via natural selection happened, but since some of us know it doesn't work that way, it must have been directed by an Intelligent Designer.\n \n \n Is evolution scientific?\n \n * Not the parts that some of us disagree with.\n \n \n Does evolution ever take place?\n \n * Yes or no.\n \n \n How dogmatic is evolutionary theory?\n \n * Very.\n \n \n Does evolution violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics?\n \n * Boy does it ever! It violates it everywhere. The second law of thermodynamics says that evolution can't happen, but biologists still say evolution happens.\n \n \n What are three important discoveries made by Intelligent Design researchers?\n \n * 1. Some parts of some organisms are very complex.\n * \n * \n \n \n Has Intelligent Design theory led to any advancements in genetics, biotechnology, medicine or life sciences in general?\n \n * \n \n \n Isn't Intelligent Design just a rehashed Design argument?\n \n * No, design arguments were put aside long ago because they are faulty: they assumed a design to prove that a designer exists. Intelligent Design is completely different.\n \n \n I've heard that there isn't really a scientific controversy, that 99+% of biologists take evolution as a given in their work. Is that true?\n \n * No, there really is a raging controversy, but most biologists don't know it because they only read \"accepted\", \"peer-reviewed\", or \"good\" scientific journals. And while it may be true that \"most\" biologists accept evolution, we do have several on our side, along with lots of scientists from other fields of study like engineering and computer science, and thousands of ministers, politicians, and creationist homeschool teachers.\n \n \n I'm confused about Intelligent Design's stance on the theory of evolution, can you summarize it?\n \n * Of course. The evidence gathered by Intelligent Design proponents clearly shows that:\n 1. Evolution does not happen.\n 2. Evolution happens in some cases.\n 3. Some evolution is directed evolution.\n 4. Natural selection does not work.\n 5. Natural selection works in many cases, but not all.\n 6. Microevolution does not happen.\n 7. Microevolution is evidence of directed evolution.\n 8. Macroevolution does not happen.\n 9. Macroevolution is evidence of directed evolution.\n 10. Life was created 6000 years ago.\n 11. Life was formed over millions or billions of years through design and the processes of directed evolution.\n 12. Life was formed over millions or billions of years through design, and the processes of directed and undirected evolution.\n Basically, we think something is wrong with the theory of evolution, we're just not sure what.\n \n \n It seems like Intelligent Design isn't a theory itself, it's just a collection of arguments against evolution.\n \n * Technically, that's not a question, it's a statement, so there's no need to answer it here.\n \n\n \n Another one. http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/hunch/hunch.html\n \n All in all pretty silly, yet this is what ID is all about. It's like slick politicians that know how to talk out of both sides of their mouths.\n \n I surely don't have the time, but maybe somebody can come up with an evolution or \"Darwinism\" version.",
