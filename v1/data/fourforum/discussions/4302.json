I'm sick of U2 rehashing the same music and getting rewarded for it.)\n \n Secondly, Nellie McKay was the biggest snuff of the night, not nominated for a single thing. Her album was right up there with Genius Loves Company and American Idiot. It was fantastic. Most original thing I heard this year.

The American music industry has gone all business and forgotten the music. The bands that are truly good and winning awards are only doing so because they have been around long enough and may have known people in the music industry who actually cared about music.\n \n Did you know that powers that be at Clear Channel have actually admitted to not caring about quality music, but rather what makes a buck? - and these are the wing nuts deciding what gets airplay. I spend a lot of time at local shows, online and bending the ears of musicians and music fans to find out about the good stuff.\n \n I remember when the local hard rock station was bragging about playing the new music first when they started playing The White Stripes. I laughed - I had them beat on that band by two years and already owned albums.\n \n Good music is still out there - it just takes a lot of work to find. If another band of Zeppelin caliber came along today I question whether the industry would recognize what they had....",

I personally enjoy country music and most of my favorite songs are ones that really don't get much airtime. Among my favorite artists are Rodney Atkins, Chris Cagle, Dusty Drake, Emerson Drive, Jimmy Wayne. I'll bet you haven't heard of most of these people if you don't listen to country. And none of these people have a bit of a chance of winning a grammy.",
