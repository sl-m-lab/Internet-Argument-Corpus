   "When it comes to gay marriage your first thought should be \"Why?\" followed immediately by \"Why not?\" If the only answers you can give for second question boil down to tradition for its own sake and your personal religious views, look at other places where those reasons are sufficent for policy. You tend to get governments such as Iran. If your answers to the first question on the issue is my second question, you don't really have a reason to complain. Stop whining and move on to something that affects people. Now, tossing out useless reasons, look at the two lists. This isn't college level, I did this in grade school.

   "Well this evening was definitely interesting. \n Sorry I missed the conversations here, but I was doing something a bit more pro-active. \n My partner and I were members of a discussion pannel hosted by the ACLU on Marriage Equality.\n One of our fellow pannel members was a Baptist minister; Rev. Dr. Larry Greenfield, Protestants for the Common Good. He brought up an interesting point, that marriage is indeed meant to protect the \"family.\" But he then posed a question which had many of us thinking. \"What makes a family?\" \"Where in the Bible does it ever give anykind of 'ideal' for what makes a family?\"\n \n The answer: There isn't any. When seen in Biblical terms, family means any group of people (usually adults) commited to the wellfare and education of children. \n \n He then moved on to: \"What makes a marriage?\" \n He brought up another interesting point. The usage of the word \"marriage\" originally didn't specify gender at all. It simply meant two adults committed to a life together. Very simplistic.\n \n Only recently has our Government decided to narrowly define marriage. That was with the signing of DOMA in 1996. Before then there were almost NO laws which specified gender when speaking of marriage. \n \n So in all actuality the whole concept of a marriage being between one man and one woman, is extremely new, in the sceme of things.",

They are both part of the Old Testament Holiness Code, a religious, not a moral code; it later became the Jewish Purity Laws. [\"Abomination\" is used throughout the Old Testament to designate sins that involve ethnic contamination or idolatry. The word relates to the failure to worship God or to worshiping a false god; it does not relate to morality.] Professor Soards tell us, \"Old Testament experts view the regulations of Leviticus as standards of holiness, directives for the formation of community life, aimed at establishing and maintaining a people's identity in relation to God.\"B-4 This is because God was so determined that his people would not adopt the practices of the Baal worshipers in Canaan, and same-gender sex was part of Baal worship. (The laws say nothing about women engaging in same-gender sex; probably this had to do with man's dominance, and such acts by the subservient had nothing to do with religious impurity.)\n \n God required purity for his worship. Anything pure was unadulterated, unmixed with anything else These Purity Laws prohibited mixing different threads in one garment, sowing a field with two kinds of seed, crossbreeding animals. A few years ago in Israel when an orthodox government came into power, McDonalds had to stop selling cheeseburgers. Hamburgers, OK. Cheese sandwiches, OK. But mixing milk and meat in one sandwich violated the Purity Laws--it had nothing to do with morality. These were laws about worshipping God, not ethics, and so have no bearing on our discussion of morality. Helmut Thielicke remarks on these passages: \"It would never occur to anyone to wrench these laws of cultic purification from their concrete situation and give them the kind of normative authority that the Decalogue, for example, has.\"B-5\n \n \n \n Another reason they are not pertinent to our discussion is that these laws were for the particular time and circumstances existing when they were given. If you planted a fruit tree, you could not eat its fruit until its fifth year, and all fruit the fourth year must be offered to the Lord. A worker must be paid his wage on the day of his labor. You must not harvest a field to its edge. We readily dismiss most of them as not applicable to our day and culture, and if we dismiss some of them for any reason, we have to dismiss all of them, including the sexual regulations, for that same reason.\n \n \n \n When we add the fact that these laws were talking about heterosexuals, it makes three reasons, any one of which would be sufficient, why they have no bearing on questions about homosexuals or homosexuality or on the morality of same-gender sex by homosexuals today.",

Marriage is a pagan concept. Pagan marriage allowed two people of either gender to \"marry\" in a sense of joining as one entity. Only during the Roman empire and later did marriage offically only become man and women. \n \n The very origin of marriage was never always between a man and woman.",

   "I beg to differ. If you read Mark 10:6-9, it explains that a man and woman are made for each other and if a man puts his wife away and marries another, it is adultry.\n \n If this man was a preacher, it looks like he would show where the Bible says that a woman and woman should get married in order to condone same sex marriages.\n\n \n Actually that passage does not define a marriage. \n It just says that a man shouldn't divorce his wife.\n It does say that in the beginning god made man and woman.\n You can infer whatever you wish about that, but it doesn't explicitly say anything about a marriage being strictly between a man and a woman.\n \n Besides, if current laws were actually rooted in the Bible, in this passage, then divorce would be illegal. But our laws are NOT rooted in the Bible, so the passage is irrelevant. \n \n I realize you were addressing a different point but I just had to respond.\n \n \n Here is the whole context though:\n \nMark 10\n \n 1And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.\n \n 2And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.\n \n 3And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?\n \n 4And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.\n \n 5And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.\n \n 6But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.\n \n 7For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;\n \n 8And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.\n \n 9What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\n \n 10And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.\n \n 11And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.\n \n 12And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery. \n\n \n I love how Jesus asks what Moses did and then tells them that Moses only did it because they were buttholes. :) \n \n So he didn't say that Moses had it wrong, but he didn't say that Moses had it right either.\n \n This really must have happened and was accurately recorded, because it sounds like the words of a consummate politician.\n \n Damn the Bible kills me.",
