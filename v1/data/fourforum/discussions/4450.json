What we find in the states is the fact that women can speak more easily about a health problem that affects them.

Komen Fund, for breast cancer. We also have the concern that men should seek out a M.D. for yearly check-ups, and it took alot of pushing, on my part, for my husband to be checked.\n \n Please know that we do have concerns.",
