Of course don't expect any of the radicals here to understand.... :xbanghead\n\n \n Eugene Volokh \u0095 October 28, 2009 1:16 pm \n \n \nThat's the title of a new article in the Columbia Law Review (the link is just to an abstract, since no PDF is available). The law review asked me whether I could write a commentary for its online supplement (the Sidebar), and I did, here, under the title The First and Second Amendments; the author's response to my response is here. Here's the text of my article (for the footnotes, see the version I link to above):\n \n \n I. The Supposed Analogy to Obscenity\n \n Analogies between the First Amendment and the Second (and comparable state constitutional protections) are over 200 years old. District of Columbia v. Heller itself makes them, and they can often make sense.\n \n Such analogies might, for instance, yield the conclusion that (1) most guns (like most speech) are fully protected by the Second Amendment, subject to some restrictions that leave open \"ample alternative channels\" for effective self-defense, but (2) some narrow categories of valueless or marginal weapons (like some speech) are unprotected. Distinctions between the two Amendments can make sense, too, though I leave them for other articles.\n \n But Guns as Smut does something peculiar: It analogizes a core category of private arms to one of the least protected and marginal categories of speech (obscenity). It's hard to see any justification for such an analogy, other than a purely instrumental one.\n \n The premise of the First Amendment's obscenity jurisprudence is that obscenity is historically recognized as one of the \"limited areas\" of speech that \"lack any serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value,\" and are thus \"not protected by the First Amendment.\" Obscenity, at home or elsewhere, is a marginal category of speech that lacks the full protection that most speech gets. Because of this, selling, buying, and possessing obscenity in public places can be outlawed, and long has been outlawed. Only the special \"solicitude to protect the privacies of the life within [the home]\" leads to the prohibition on punishment for mere home possession of obscenity.\n \n None of this analysis applies to guns. Possessing guns is traditionally legal. Guns do serve the self-defense value that the Court has found to be embodied in the Second Amendment. And, Heller held, ordinary guns are at the core of \"arms,\" not on the margin.\n \n Even carrying guns in public places is traditionally legal (though often with license requirements), and serves the constitutional value of armed self-defense. But I need not rely on that: The premise of the Court's obscenity decisions is that obscenity lacks constitutional value without regard to the place in which it may be present, though it may not be suppressed via intrusions into the home. That premise does not extend to private gun ownership under Heller.\n \n And naturally Guns as Smut's unsound premise leads to unsound results. If guns were really like obscenity, the government would be free to ban the buying of guns and not just their public possession. Guns as Smut's conclusion indeed suggests that it \"remain[s] unresolved\" whether the government could \"so restrict[] the commercial availability of guns that only guns in situ in the home, or those made by enterprising amateur gunsmiths, would be beyond regulation\"; the Article's interpretation of Heller \"will not, and cannot, provide [an] answer[]\" to that question.\n \n Yet Heller expressly holds that the Second Amendment secures an individual right to possess handguns \"for the core lawful purpose of self-defense.\" Whatever such a right might mean, it must include the right to accomplish that core lawful purpose by acquiring the handgun. No sensible interpretation of Heller can leave the status of that right \"unresolved.\" And no sensible analogy between the Second and First Amendments can analogize typical privately owned arms to material that the Court has expressly held lacks First Amendment value.\n",

   "and gun nuts say f*** the children when we have to decide between saving guns and childrens lives\n\n Man Brady I am SO GLAD you said we need to protect our children! There is something I am very passionate about, and maybe you will be the very first to call for common sense legislation regulating all of this, since effects so many more children! \n   From a study by the U of Tennessee medical school \n If confiscating over 80 million handguns is justified because approximately fifteen children under age five die in handgun accidents annually, is a ban on cigarette lighters justified by the fact that four times as many children in that age group die from playing with then annually?\n \n Consider the fact that over 400% more children under age fifteen die in drownings than in gun accidents;[227] twenty times as many children under age five drown in bathtubs and home swimming pools as are killed in handgun accidents.[228] Few people need a bathtub (as opposed to a shower stall) or a swimming pool. If the tragedy of accidental childhood gun fatalities justifies confiscating over 80 million handguns, or all of the more than 230 million firearms, do the much greater numbers of tragic childhood drownings justify a licensing system under which only the disabled and others who show they \"truly need\" a bathtub or swimming pool will be allowed to have them?[229]\n\n Come On! Be Reasonable! Do it for the Children! What do you say Brady? Or do you Anti-gun nuts say f*** the children?",

Downward trends, also being reported by other sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are occurring even as firearm ownership rises in the U.S.\n CDC reports a significant decline in accidental firearms-related fatalities in the U.S. between 1994 and 2005. \n\n \n So what do ya Say!

   "Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer:\n \n \"Chicago says that their gun law has saved hundreds, including -- and they have statistics -- lots of women in domestic cases,\" Breyer said. \"When you have the First Amendment, or some of the other amendments, there is always a big area where it's free speech versus a whole lot of things, but not often free speech versus life. When it's free speech versus life, we very often decide in favor of life.\"\n Justices debate Chicago handgun ban - CNN.com\n \n So even if the Chicago handgun ban does violate a Constitutional right it could still be justifiable.\n\n \n Galileo,\n \n That's an interesting claim. It sounds a lot like many of the \"must be cause and effect\" claims we hear all the time on this blog cite-from both sides. Sort of like the reverse of the pro-gun comparison that takes a relatively crime free rural community with lax guns regulations and compares it with a large urban center with a much higher crime rate despite strict gun control laws-which is then used to advance the cause and effect claim that high numbers of legitimate gun owners cause lower crime rates. \n \n I will note that in every instance these claims-from both sides-are never universally accepted or rejected. In every instance some will accept these claims while others will reject them. What I find fascinating is the blind hypocrisy of the common denominator which seems to be involved in every acceptance or rejection of one of these claims: that claims appear to be either accepted or rejected based merely on the determination of whether they support or contradict someone's view of gun control. It's as if no one cares about possible flaws in the methodology behind the stats so long as they help their side. \n \n It leads me to wonder whether Justice Breyer would so easily accept a similar claim if it were made in favor of striking down a gun control law. \n \n Now I won't say that I have never done it, but it is rare that I will engage in a statistical discussion. I will say that I cannot recall ever using statistics alone to make a positive cause and effect argument. I just don't see how you can so easily reduce the ever changing dynamics of human interaction to a mathematical formula-to say that law X alone is responsible for Y effect.\n \n So Breyer says Chicago has convincing statistics which make this cause and effect leap. \n \n Forgive me if I sound skeptical of a statistical claim whose most ardent supporters cannot reduce it to a more precise figure than \"lots of women.\" Forgive my doubt of a scientific claim that uses terms you would more expect to hear from a 30 year old man who lives with his mother when asked just how many women he has been out with in his lifetime (Sure, I've dated \"lots of women\").\n \n So I decided to see these statistics for myself. I looked in Chicago's brief filed with the Court to find them. An entire section of Chicago's brief is filled with statistics. But I cannot find anywhere within the brief a claim that the laws have saved \"hundreds\" of lives. And as for Breyer's caveat assertion-that Chicago credibly claims its statistics also prove the laws have saved \"lots of women\" who would have otherwise been victims in domestic violence situations-I found that Chicago never once mentioned the issue of domestic violence at all in its brief. \n \n I suppose it is possible that Chicago made the claim for the first time during the oral argument. Does anyone know where Chicago makes the claim that its laws have saved \"hundreds\" of lives, including \"lots\" of women? I don't want to reject the claim out of hand just because it runs counter to common sense. I just want to see the data so I can see for myself what merit if any the claim has. \n \n I think we can all agree that no right, whether it is the right to life or the RKBA, should be subject to limitation on the basis of fraudulent statistical claims. And I trust we can all agree that if a statistical claim is worth making then it is worth making the data which supports it available for public scrutiny. \n \n Is it too much to ask that I see these statistics before I am asked to accept them?",

The federal power to regulate commerce among the several states was likewise granted to Congress from the powers which were then possessed by the States and by the People. There was certainly no understanding in 1789 that state power to regulate interstate commerce (e.g., by inspecting goods at ports of entry) included the power to compel individuals to purchase goods in commerce.\n - HT - David Kopel",

   "Galileo. I know you want to try and fins some mechanism or some authority to disarm us from our founding documents, but Surely you do not think that our Founders gave total control of our Militia to our Federal Government to the point of which, and or IF by chance our government went rogue, and because usurpers, that they were totally hamstrung, by a tyrannical congress! The Revolutionary started when the British came to both Lexington and Concord to seize the powder stores, and seizing weapons along the way. \n \n Our Bill of Rights, and the Preamble to the BOR shows the level of distrust of government, even the very government they were in the process of making. \n \n   Bill of Rights Preamble (purpose of the bill of right)  \n THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution\n \n \n From our National Archives. \n   Bill of Rights -- First ten Amendments. \nThe fact that the Constitution did not include a bill of rights to specifically protect Americans' hard-won rights sparked the most heated debates during the ratification process. To the Federalists, those who favored the Constitution, a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states; also, most states had bills of rights. To the Anti-Federalists, those who opposed the Constitution, the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable. Throughout the ratification process, individuals and state ratification conventions called for the adoption of a bill of rights.\n\n This is the context of the 2nd Amendment. \n \n Amendment II\n \n A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\n\n They were concerned about protecting them, and us, from becoming subservient to any form of government ever again! \n   The Bill Of Rights ~ The First Ten Amendments to the Constitution\n Alexander Hamilton 1775\n \n The Sacred Rights of Mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchment,. or musty records. They are written with a sun beam in whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself, and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power. \n\n In fact the total system of government that our founders instituted makes the Congress, the President, the Judiciary and all government subservient to us. We are the only owners of this country, and power is always to remain in our hands. \n   FEDERALIST No. 78 \n Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental. \n\n The Declaration of independence says \n Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed\n\n Governments powers and authority to act is only on loan from us, We the People. We can take it back at any point and time. \n   Marbury V Madison Supreme Court Decision \nChef Justice John Marshall \n \n The people made the Constitution, and the people can unmake it.

   "Uhh, do you guys understand that federalist 29 was written before the 2nd amendment was created or even adopted, right?\n\n Yep. We do. The Federalist were trying to to SELL the Federal form of government to We the People, who distrusted all government. They did not want it, and felt they were doing just fine without it. We the People Feared relinquishing power and control over them to anyone ever again. The Federalist Papers were written to try and explain how their Federal Government could not and would not ever become rouge or a usurper ever again! And how We the People were armed, just in case it ever did. \n \n That is the proper context of Shall Not Infringe. \n \n Here is an explanation of why the Federalist felt that the BoR was unnecessary and could even possibly be dangerous.  Federalist Papers no. 84 \n I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power.\"\n\n  9th Amendment - Annotations \nRights Retained by the People \n \n Aside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those.\n\n so they wrote the 9th Amendment to cover that possibility.\n  9th Amendment - Annotations \nThe enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. \n\n And the 10 Amendment too.\n 10th Amendment\n The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n",

They did the impossible. They were so oppressed that they fought the most powerful army the world had even known at that time, and won. They were of that mindset, and of that belief, when they wrote the Federalist papers, and built our Constitution. It is a series of checks and balances with the 3 branches of government a check against the others with the armed populist being the final check on all. \n \n However it is YOUR SIDE that does not want to live up to the Bill of Rights.

In writing it, I identified three distinct answers to the question: \"How could a movement founded to liberate workers from capitalist oppression end up shooting them in the back when they tried to flee the Workers' Paradise?\"\n \n 1. The Actonian \"power corrupts\" story\n \n 2. The Hayekian \"worst get on top\" story\n \n 3. The Richterian \"born bad\" story\n \n Here's my summary:\n \n Lord Acton and F.A. Hayek have inspired the two most popular explanations for the crimes of actually-existing socialism. While Acton never lived to see socialists gain power, their behavior seems to perfectly illustrate his aphorism that, \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" For all their idealism, even socialists will do bad things if left unchecked. Hayek, with the benefit of hindsight, suggested a slightly different explanation: Under socialism, \"the worst get on top.\" On this theory, the idealistic founders of socialism were gradually pushed out by brutal cynics as their movement's power increased.\n \n Richter's novel advances a very different explanation for socialism's \"moral decay\": The movement was born bad. While the early socialists were indeed \"idealists,\" their ideal was totalitarian. Their overriding goals were to engineer a new society and a New Socialist Man. If this meant treating workers like slaves - depriving them of the freedom to choose their occupation or location, forbidding them to quit, splitting up families without their consent, and imposing draconian punishments on dissenters - so be it.\n \n \n Be sure and read it all, including the comments by other economists and historians.\n \n I have quoted from The Gulag Achipeligo before warning about what you were promoting. Perhaps the more alert got it but it must have whizzed over your head. That Second Amendment kind of gets in your way doesn't it? You know exactly what would happen and why so you continue to use deceit and false delimmas and lies to promote loss of a Constitutional, unalienable RIGHT. I am surprised you even get a head nod from anyone except the same from your brood.",

Pure idiocy!\n\n This is like shooting fish in a barrel. Did it ever cross your mind that the militia could have been under the direction of local and state governments at that time? And if there were any question about the militia being under government regulation, Article I of the Constitution would have settled that. \n Article I place the militia under joint custody of the states and Congress. \n Later, Supreme Court justice Joseph Story recognized the importance of regulation of the militia and warned of the danger of a large standing army. He echoed the thoughts and fears of the Founders when the Second Amendment was written:\n \n \"The militia is the natural defense of a free country against sudden foreign invasions, domestic insurrections, and domestic usurpations of power by rulers. It is against sound policy for a free people to keep up large military establishments and standing armies in time of peace, both from the enormous expenses, with which they are attended, and the facile means, which they afford ambitious and unprincipled rulers, to subvert the government, or trample upon the rights of the people. The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them. And yet, though this truth would seem so clear, and the importance of a well regulated militia would seem so undeniable, it cannot be disguised, that among the American people there is a growing indifference to any system of militia discipline, and a strong disposition from a sense of burthens, to be rid of all regulations. How it is practicable to keep the people duly armed without some organization, it is difficult to see. There is certainly no small danger, that indifference may lead to disgust, and disgust to contempt; and thus gradually undermine all the protection intended by this clause of our national bill of rights.\"\n \n It is probably because of the opposition by people like you to regulation that the militia was shown to be ineffective in war and the nation was forced to resort to a larger standing army. Because of the poor performance of the militia in the Spanish American War, the National Guard was created in the early 20th Century- an organization very similar to the Army Reserve. Thus the nightmare that the Founders tried to guard against when they wrote the Second Amendment has become a reality in our own day- and repealing the handgun bans in place like Chicago isn't going to change that- not that you or your side really seems to care.",

   " Not everyone who supports some form of gun regulation has an irrational fear of firearms. \n\n I know you were in the Navy. I don't think you have an irrational fear. Again my only point was to show the extent of just how un-thought out Galileo's scam was. By law one group cannot be unfairly singled out. It is all of us or none of us.\n \n What Galileo is advocating effects us all because Congress has the power to call, and discipline the Militia. That means they can call us and train us, only if they call all of us. Anti-gunners too. Not just gun owners like the Anti-gunners want.\n \n From other things we have discussed, Congress did require those of militia age to have such quartermaster objects like rifle, ammo and other military accoutrement, at each citizen's very own expense. The power to provide for arming the Militias. Of course we now do that now through our taxes. \n \n Galileo, I am sure, ONLY plans some kind of a scam on our privately owned property. And that property having nothing to do with the United States, or a militia, but what he suggest, by the introduction of his scam on the Constitution, does put us all into a training requirement. Unless he ONLY wants to try and justify some kind of a seizure of our privately owned firearms, under the guise of some sort of militia equipment scam. Which I don't think he has any a problem with.\n \n ALL AMERICANS age 17 to 45, and in my state every males up to age 60, not just gun owners, are in the unorganized Militia. I am pointing out that this is the reality of his scam jackpot. \n \n Now I am sure you probably have other plans for your free time, and for your finances, but that is the effect of what he is suggesting. Not to mention the cost to our economy for his militia disciplining training shortsightedness scam would entail. emoticon_smile",

   "This is like shooting fish in a barrel. Did it ever cross your mind that the militia could have been under the direction of local and state governments at that time?\n\n \n No it did not! The Crown was the official federal gov't and that is made plain in the Declaration of Independance. The Colonies were in revolt against the Central Gov't at the time. Their intent was to establish a gov't named in the Declaration of Independance and were definitely not a creation of that central government! The British Crown with it's \"standing army\" was the only official force at the time. \n \n \nAnd if there were any question about the militia being under government regulation, Article I of the Constitution would have settled that. \n Article I place the militia under joint custody of the states and Congress.\n\n \n That comment is so ridiculous to not even rate a response. Do tell how \"states that were not in evidence at the time of the Revolution and how Congress operated\"! As for the Crown, they viewed the militia as terrorists and criminals and indeed hung those captured when they were caught. ...and you maintain that King George and the Crown has any part of forming \"the militia\"?\n \n \nLater, Supreme Court justice Joseph Story recognized the importance of regulation of the militia and warned of the danger of a large standing army. He echoed the thoughts and fears of the Founders when the Second Amendment was written:\n\n \n And exactly when was this Second Amendment written? and established? and why? It certainly was not at the time or before the Revolution was won.\n \n \n\"The militia is the natural defense of a free country against sudden foreign invasions, domestic insurrections, and domestic usurpations of power by rulers. It is against sound policy for a free people to keep up large military establishments and standing armies in time of peace, both from the enormous expenses, with which they are attended, and the facile means, which they afford ambitious and unprincipled rulers, to subvert the government, or trample upon the rights of the people. The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them. And yet, though this truth would seem so clear, and the importance of a well regulated militia would seem so undeniable, it cannot be disguised, that among the American people there is a growing indifference to any system of militia discipline, and a strong disposition from a sense of burthens, to be rid of all regulations. How it is practicable to keep the people duly armed without some organization, it is difficult to see. There is certainly no small danger, that indifference may lead to disgust, and disgust to contempt; and thus gradually undermine all the protection intended by this clause of our national bill of rights.\"\n\n \n Justice Story is plainly addressing people exactly like YOU AND THE .ORGS who have nothing but contempt for the militia and armed citizens!\n \n \nIt is probably because of the opposition by people like you to regulation that the militia was shown to be ineffective in war and the nation was forced to resort to a larger standing army.\n\n \n Another uninformed statement. Exactly who is fighting the wars at the moment even in this day and age? Reference that Militia Clause again in 10 USC section 311.\n \n \nBecause of the poor performance of the militia in the Spanish American War, the National Guard was created in the early 20th Century- an organization very similar to the Army Reserve.\n \n \n You still can't see that 'militia clause' in 10 USC section 311 from the bottom of the barrel? :xcensored\n \n \nThus the nightmare that the Founders tried to guard against when they wrote the Second Amendment has become a reality in our own day- and repealing the handgun bans in place like Chicago isn't going to change that- not that you or your side really seems to care.\n\n \n You are right there...disarming the militia has long been a tactic by our ENEMIES. Their purpose as you wrongly read Justice Story is to: \"The militia is the natural defense of a free country against sudden foreign invasions, domestic insurrections, and domestic usurpations of power by rulers.

Between a rock and a hard place is not advisable :) emoticon_cry\n \n When shown the history of the militia and the FF words describing both the militia and the \"right of the people to not be infringed\" which was clarified in Heller, the grasping of straws continues unabated. Much to the consternation of these folks, the proof they try to claim is invalid as it has always been. The individual right to keep and bear arms is a natural right and a concept of \"reasonable\" is still an invalid standard of review in the courts on the issue.\n\n What would a person who claims the standing army is part of the militia when it's convenient in an argument know about the Founding Fathers' thoughts on what a militia is? Next you'll be claiming that King George's soldiers in red uniforms were part of the militia of that day.",

   "So.. Let's say the military gives a coup d'\u00e9tat (translation: assumes control of the government by force).

   "You got it wrong. If the government ever truly became tyrannical then that government would no longer have any legitimate, constitutional power over the militia because the Constitution would no longer be in effect.\n\n \n You really believe that? The Constitution is a joke in this day and age; even to you, as you acknowledged in the OP of this very thread. Leftists pretend to support the Constitution, but when they make policies they don't even take the Constitution into Consideration. They violate the First Amendment with this so-called fairness doctrine. Their desire to ban and confiscate firearms violate the Second and Fourth Amendments.\n \n Even in the very second amendment that you claim to support, you ignore where it says \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\". You're a typical leftist, Galileo. When your version the Constitution supports you, you defend it to the death. But when it gets in your way, you don't try to tear it down; you either ignore it or reinterpret it. Barack Obama's policies have led me to the conclusion that when dictatorship emerges in America, the Constitution won't be torn down; it'll just be ignored and pushed to the side where it'll be used when it to defend leftist goals whenever it supports them (which it rarely does).\n \n Further, I think you have no right to talk about what's constitutional when the OP of this very thread says \"it's OK to violate the Constitution.\"\n \n \nHowever, the militia would be in a better position to overthrow such a tyrannical government if there had been some previous system of militia discipline established by the government before it became tyrannical. Those that question why military training would make one perform better in battle are free to do their own research.\n\n \n See above. The Constitution doesn't need to be torn down for America to become a dictatorship.",
