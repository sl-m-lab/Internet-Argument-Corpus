   " The article says 3-5 years to commercial production, given we're dealing with algae with a potentially explosive growth rate the fact they're using a GM strain wouldn't actually pose a problem as far as supply is concerned.\n\n That's not the way I see it. If they were using a natural strain then all they would need to do is harvest the near inexhaustible supplies in the ocean. Since they're using a GM strain they have to keep it contained, which means inland facilities. As the article says: \"They also have the classic renewables problem in that you're dealing with the ultimate energy source, the Sun, which is quite diffuse, so you're only getting in peak conditions around 0.5KW per square metre. You need vast, great big farms.\" And of course only some small fraction of that energy will go towards making oil; much of it will have to go towards the biology of the algae. You're going to need giant algae farms, using tons and tons of water, to produce much oil. Doable? Sure. Able to produce meaningful amounts of oil in an economic manner any time soon? I really doubt it.\n \n \n\n Alas they do seem to be as open as the Soviets in the '60s.

Places with lots of cheap land generally don't have much water, which I assume they'll need lots of to grow the algae. A random site I found http://www.montanahereicome.com/market.htm suggests you could get 5 acres of vacant land in Montana (to pick a state with open land) for about $100 thousand. So $50 million would get you in the ballpark of 4 square miles, at those prices.",

I mean, algae can be either fresh or salt water, but any one variety will be one or the other, right? And if you're using sea water then you would need to be really, REALLY sure that no algae at all escaped back to the sea. If this stuff got loose and flourished, it could well cause mass extinctions. A lot of the sea's food web starts with algae, and I have to assume that an algae that's 40% crude oil would kill most things that ate it. Imagine an oil spill that got bigger over time, and if you missed any during clean up it would come right back again. Getting any of this algae within 100 miles of a coast seems like too big a risk to me.",

   "Good.\n \n The commercial viability will obviously depend on the price of oil. If it drops to $10 a barrel, then perhaps why bother. If the price skyrockets to $10,000 a barrel as some \"peak oil\" enthusiasts should expect, then it may be a different story.\n \n None of us here are qualified to determine whether this is viable or not at tomorrow's price levels - the entrepeneurs undertaking to invest in it obviously think it is, and they will bear the risk if they're wrong.\n \n Incidentally this technology doesn't have to be done on top of a body of water like a lake, it could be employed in a style more like a factory than a farm, which is probably the way it will go given the low density yields, except where land is very cheap.\n \n This will mean energy is initially provided by electrical generation rather than the sun, if we're lucky we just may have a better way to convert that power into a form suitable for consumer engines.",

I think it is safe to say that if this stuff were to get out no matter where it would be, would be an enviromental disaster of biblical proportions. If you think global warming or a nuclear disaster is bad this would be thousands of times worse. It wouldn't need to get in to get just the ocean to cause this disaster any water source would do it, any lake or pond even with out an inlet or out let. All you would need is for one seagull, duck or goose landing in the stuff and taking off and then landing in another body of water to spread it. Once it got a foot hold it would move so fast you would never be able to stop it. It is a good idea only if they could design a counter measure that would kill it or devour it as a back up then again if that ever got out it would also be just as bad if not worse.",
