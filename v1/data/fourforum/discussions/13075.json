   "Earlier today, Fox host Trace Gallagher interviewed Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) on the \"Cash for Clunkers\" program. Gallagher, being a Foxer, tried to get Stabenow to admit the program was an abysmal failure, but Stabenow not only held her own, she absolutely destroyed Gallagher's criticism.\n \n So what did Gallagher do? He cut the interview short (at the 1:58 mark in this video), claiming that he had \"breaking news\" to deliver. What was the breaking news? \"Brand new video\" from Discovery Channel's \"Shark week.\"\n\n Video at the web-site...\n Daily Kos: State of the Nation\n \n As if anybody had any doubts about their extreme partisanship...",

I don't want to get my info from a puppet or a cheerleader...\n \n As to partizenship of the different 'news' networks... \n \n There seems to be plenty...\n \n MSNBC's Contessa Brewer....\n Brewer bias shows plenty of doozies, like:\n \n \u0095Brewer suggesting Republicans think Americans \"are a bunch of ######\"\n \u0095Brewer's grudge against Arizona State University for not giving President Obama an honorary doctorate \n \u0095Brewer calling Miss California USA Carrie Prejean a \"hater\"\n \u0095Brewer suggesting a link between rank-and-file Republicans and violent right-wing radicals\n \u0095Brewer being annoyed with her network cutting away from a President Obama speech to show a GOP news conference on its budget proposal\n \u0095Warning that voting against the stimulus package was like voting for a new Great Depression\n \n \n CNN's got bias too...\n \n \n\n \n CNN glowingly featured an entire segment on Thursday's American Morning about Wendell Potter, a former chief corporate spokesman for the health insurance company Cigna, and he attempted to discredit conservative ad campaigns against health \"reform\" proposals as \"outright lies.\" But reporter Jim Acosta left out his current ideological employment: since May, Potter has worked as a senior fellow on health care for the Center for Media and Democracy, the brainchild of John Stauber, the co-author of \"Banana Republicans: How the Right Wing is Turning America Into a One-Party State,\" and a unpaid adviser to the anti-war group Iraq Veterans Against the War \n Acosta's segment, which aired at the end of the 7 am Eastern hour of the CNN program, featured four extended clips from Potter, and introduced the former Cigna spokesman as a \"health insurance company insider...[who] has stepped forward to warn the public about the industry's practices, and some of those ads shaping the debate.\" After a short introduction of his subject, Acosta began by playing the first clip of Potter from a recent Senate hearing, where Democratic Senator Jay Rockefeller compared him to Russell Crowe's character in the tobacco-industry-expose movie \"The Insider.\" \n\n \n \n \n Ok, so there's pleanty of bais going around. At least Fox had a Dem on there talking about their plan. CNN brings on people to bash the Pubs and the Healthcare industry without anyone there to defend them....\n \n The fact is there seems to be a lot of partisanship today. With Rush or The Huffington Post you know what you're dealing with. It's important for us to do our homework and know who's talking to us and why.",

Also, Obama said that the AARP had endorsed the plan and the AARP said they did nothing of the sort....\n Hmmmm, who's doing the misinformation again?\n\n Good question...\n \n Here's an article from the Texas AARP head...\n It explicitly notes the need for healthcare reform. It explicitly condemns the \"myth machines\" that are running rampant right now about the issue.\n \n Also, I don't know what Obama himself has claimed.\n If he just claimed that the AARP has seen the need for change, then that is very true.\n If he has claimed the AARP endorsed his plan, I don't see the evidence of that yet.\n So you don't want to see any changes to health care? Well, imagine your health insurance premiums doubling over the next 10 years, the Medicare trust fund going bankrupt and the number of uninsured Texans continuing its meteoric rise. That's what you will have without meaningful health insurance reform.\n \n Special interests defending the status quo are employing an array of scare tactics, half-truths and outright deception in trying to convince us that the system is not in critical condition.\n \n The reality is that -- with health care costs eating up 16% of our gross domestic product (GDP) and the rising cost of medical care taking a toll on millions already struggling in this economic crisis -- we cannot truly fix our economy until we fix health care.\n \n As a dynamic organization of 40 million members with a long history of fighting for quality health care for all Americans -- including protecting and strengthening Medicare -- AARP has been targeted by those intent on slamming the brakes on any attempts to reform the system. We have not yet endorsed any of the bills moving through Congress but our organization is committed to making health care reform a reality. For too long, our country has settled on a health care system that costs too much, wastes too much and leaves too many without care.\n \n Unfortunately, the myth machine is out in full force today. Rather than addressing the issues with constructive dialogue, some would rather spend their energies misleading Americans.

Boccardi, and a former Republican attorney general, Richard Thornburgh.\n \n The panel said that CBS violated its standards in the report, which claimed to have found evidence that President Bush got favorable treatment in order to get into the National Guard during the Vietnam War.\n \n The report stirred a political firestorm with conservative backers of Mr. Bush denouncing it as fallacious. Four CBS news employees were ousted in the aftermath, and Mr. Rather left his position as CBS anchor.\n \n He has charged that CBS promised him further work and then reneged.\"\n \n So he's not actually saying that his allegations were true.

   "Interesting article. Although the case doesn't appear to actually have anything to do with the actual allegations Rather made on the air, so I don't really see what the point is.\n\n Before I continue, do you have any idea what \"panel\" they are referencing in the lawsuit, and what that panel's job was and what that panel's conclusion was?\n \n \n \nSo he's not actually saying that his allegations were true. He's just saying that the panel was \"politically biased.\" He's claiming his career was tarnished. Good luck with that case.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n Wow.\n Do you think it's viable to just sue somebody who has a panel that concludes something you don't like, and force them to change their conclusion???\n \n HE HAS NO RECOURSE in suing them to make them say \"his allegations were true\".\n He is doing what he can LEGALLY. This is as close as he can get.\n \n As for your comment \"he's not actually saying that his allegations were true\" ???\n Just wow.\n I didn't realize you didn't know that Dan Rather DOES believe his story was true.\n Dan Rather vs. CBS, and the truth about George W. Bush | Salon",

In the article you posted here, it says he will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his story was true and the papers were authentic. I guess we'll see.",
