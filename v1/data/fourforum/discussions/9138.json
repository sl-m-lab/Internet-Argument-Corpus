   "Pope says military chaplains must help troops focus on peacemaking\n \n VATICAN CITY (CNS) -- While the ideal that modern armies exist only for defense, security and freedom is not yet a reality, Catholic military chaplains must help members of the armed forces focus on peacemaking, Pope Benedict XVI said. \"The church is missionary by its nature and its first task is evangelization, which aims at proclaiming and witnessing to Christ and promoting his Gospel of peace and love in every environment and culture,\" the pope said. Pope Benedict met with participants in a Vatican conference for military ordinaries, bishops responsible for the spiritual care of Catholics in their countries' armed forces. The conference drew more than 70 participants from 45 countries. The pope told the bishops they have two primary tasks: helping Catholics in the military live their faith and promoting peace. In the midst of the military, as in any sector of social life, the church is called to teach and witness in a way that encourages \"mentalities and structures\" to focus on establishing peace so that all people may reach their potential and everyone's basic rights would be guaranteed, he said.",
