   "The California Supreme Court just ruled that the gay weddings performed in San Francisco are void. I'm not surprised, and I even think it was the right decision. The mayor's heart was in the right place, but we can not allow local officials to ignore the law. He could have used his clout as the mayor of SF to help gay couples sue the state to change the law against gay marriage. Instead he flouted the law, and now thousands of couples that were married aren't any longer. Maybe he just didn't want to be upstaged by Massachusettes, but whatever his reasons, he went about things the wrong way.",
