   "And I'd say typical:\n \nPolice in Michigan are investigating after an irate reader of the Port Huron Times-Herald reportedly called in a threat to the newspaper after it criticized a local House representative's participation in the anti-health reform Tea Party protest two weeks ago.\n \n \"A 60-year-old Port Huron woman threatened to take a gun to the newspaper and 'do what they did at Fort Hood,' according to police,\" the Times-Herald reported on Tuesday.\n \n The threat referred to the shooting deaths of 13 people at the US Army base in Fort Hood, Texas, on November 5. Army psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan has been charged with murder in the shootings.\n \n The newspaper says the woman's alleged threat came over an editorial that ran last week which described US House Rep. Candice Miller's participation in the anti-health reform protest as \"shameful.\" Miller, a Republican who represents Michigan's 10th district, reportedly made herself very visible during the November 5 protest on Capitol Hill, organized by Republican firebrand Michele Bachmann.\n\n Newspaper threatened with &#8216;another Fort Hood&#8217; for criticizing Tea Party protest | Raw Story\n \n So, what extremist church does this nutty woman attend?
