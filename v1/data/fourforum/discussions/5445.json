You saved me some time. I have been saying this forever. Anti-coice people have been complaining about abortion and stem cell research forever but no one has a problem with freezing \"life\" indefinatly. Many many IVF atempts don't work. (mostly becuase they would work better for those who can't afford it but that's a whole nother issue.) And many more do work but in either case almost always there are some or many fertilized eggs that go unused.
