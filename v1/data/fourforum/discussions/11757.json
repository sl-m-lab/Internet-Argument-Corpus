Will the federal militia be concentrated in Philidelphia and Harriburgh, or will it be in a village? Face it, your life is not the governments responsibility. The police will do what they can where they can, but they can't be everywhere at once. Neither can the militia. So if you live in a village, will the government help you? Unlikely. Will the government shed a tear for you? No. Will the government be there to protect you as an individual? Certainly not. That's where you come in. If you don't help yourself, who will? Even if your town has one of these government regulated militias, where will you be if the militia is defeated, and the civilians are left unarmed? The situation you envisioned is not the only one that is valid, and it is certainly not the best for the individual.\n\n Nice fantasy, but you're not going to be able to take on an army by yourself. \n \n \n\n Yes, but were they actually a government? The states had very little representation, and what government they had took orders from Britain. The revolution was an act of treason, a direct violation of British law. It would take the seats from everyone in the American \"government\", if that's what you want to call it. The constitution wasn't ratified until 1788, a few years after the war ended. So in other words, it wasn't much of a government, since all politicians were actually criminals of Britain.\n\n What's your point? Enough of a government existed to organize a military force to fight the British. Enough of a government existed for laws to be passed by ten of thirteen states to allow privately owned guns to be confiscated so that they could be used by George Washington against the British. \n \n \n\n There was no official militia until the left thought it up. It's a fantasy, though a militia under control of the government would not be much different from the army, correct? So if there's a protest, the militia may not be able to participate. After all, you want the militia to take their orders from the government. A government-regulated militia is a step to tyranny, since only people in this \"militia group\". Also, your link failed to specify.\n\n So the left wrote the Constitution? Article 1 of the Constitution talks about the militia being regulated by both the federal and state governments. What did Hamilton mean when he talked about \"confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority\" in Federalist 29? \n \n \"But when once a standing army is established in any country, the people lose their liberty. When, against a regular and disciplined army, yeomanry are the only defence,&#8212; yeomanry, unskilful and unarmed,&#8212; what chance is there for preserving freedom? Give me leave to recur to the page of history, to warn you of your present danger. Recollect the history of most nations of the world. What havoc, desolation, and destruction, have been perpetrated by standing armies! An instance within the memory of some of this house will show us how our militia may be destroyed.Forty years ago, when the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man, who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them; but that they should not do it openly, but weaken them, and let them sink gradually, by totally disusing and neglecting the militia. [Here Mr. Mason quoted sundry passages to this effect.] This was a most iniquitous project. Why should we not provide against the danger of having our militia, our real and natural strength, destroyed? The general government ought, at the same time, to have some such power. But we need not give them power to abolish our militia. If they neglect to arm them, and prescribe proper discipline, they will be of no use. I am not acquainted with the military profession. I beg to be excused for any errors I may commit with respect to it. But I stand on the general principles of freedom, whereon I dare to meet any one. I wish that, in case the general government should neglect to arm and discipline the militia, there should be an express declaration that the state governments might arm and discipline them. With this single exception, I would agree to this part, as I am conscious the government ought to have the power\" - George Mason, Virginia Ratifying Convention, 1778\n George Mason spoke about the desirability of the government arming and disciplining the militia. If the militia is neglected by the government then the militia will be \"of no use\" and not able to take on \"a regular and disciplined army\".\n \n Finally, Joseph Story speaks of the desirability of the militia being regulated-\n \"The militia is the natural defense of a free country against sudden foreign invasions, domestic insurrections, and domestic usurpations of power by rulers. It is against sound policy for a free people to keep up large military establishments and standing armies in time of peace, both from the enormous expenses, with which they are attended, and the facile means, which they afford to ambition and unprincipled rulers, to subvert the government, or trample upon the rights of the people. The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpations and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them. And yet, though this truth would seem so clear, and the importance of a well regulated militia would seem so undeniable, it cannot be disguised, that among the American people there is a growing indifference to any system of militia discipline, and a strong disposition, from a sense of it burdens, to be rid of all regulations. How it is practicable to keep the people duly armed without some organization, it is difficult to see. There is certainly no small danger, that indifference may lead to disgust, and disgust to contempt; and thus gradually undermine all the protection intended by the clause of our national bill of rights.\" \n \n So he speaks about how lack of regulations \"undermine all the protection intended by the clause of our national bill of rights\". How so? Without regulation the militia will not be in a position to be an effective military force. Thus we will be forced to rely on a standing army for our national security and deal with the \"havoc, desolation, and destruction\" that have been perpetrated by such forces that George Mason spoke of. That was the fear of the Founding Fathers and it has already become a reality.",

   "Let me address a recent quote from Historian Saul Cornell which has been posted in this thread:\n \n \"Without government direction there would have been no body of Minutemen to muster on the town greens at Lexington and Concord. If the Founders had imbibed the strong gun rights ideology that drives today's gun debate we would all be drinking tea and singing, 'God save our gracious Queen.'\n \n I'm going to pick a bone with how anti-individual right advocate Saul Cornell has framed his opinion piece. Previously I have seen Cornell allowing his ideology to completely misconstrue U.S. v. Cruikshank, and he lost all credibility with me for doing so:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/9382-greatest-threat-second-amendment-4.html#post252958\n \n However, it's not honest to simply ignore this latest message by blaming the motivations of the messenger. I would rather expose some history Cornell does not choose to recognize when he made his assertion: \"If the Founders had imbibed the strong gun rights ideology that drives today's gun debate we would all be drinking tea and singing, 'God save our gracious Queen.\" From this he clearly implies the founders rejected the \"gun right's ideology\" of the existence of an individual RKBA. \n \n Yet the reality is that the beginning of revolutionary war armed resistance was made possible because of the pre-existing individual RKBA. Cornell mentions the \"Minutemen,\" but he does not describe them further in his opinion piece. To do so would force him to acknowledge that they agreed to appear within a minute bearing their privately held arms. They did not agree to meet at a central armory to have their arms handed out to them.\n \n True, his example is of an agreement involving some government direction and regulation of these men volunteering for militia service-but he chooses to avoid the fact that this militia organization was an offshoot of the already recognized right (and reality) of the people to keep and bear private arms. The volunteers already had and in many cases were exercising the individual RKBA. The right to have these arms did not suddenly come into being because of an agreement to become a militia member. They merely agreed to further exercise the RKBA by voluntarily submitting to militia organization. \n \n And this \"gun right's ideology\" concept of an individual RKBA was not confined to Cornell's example of the \"minutemen.\" There are a number of other examples, and evidence of both tolerance for and agreement with the concept of an armed public from which militia members may be called forth is easy to find if one looks. \n \n George Mason has been mentioned, and he provides an excellent example of how the founders did not create a RKBA, they instead used the pre-existing RKBA as a vehicle to create militias. When Cornell comments on \"gun rights ideology\" and tea parties he does not tell you George Mason adopted, without official government assistance or direction, the \"Fairfax Militia Plan\":\n \n \"Embodying the people. . . .a well regulated militia, composed of the Gentlemen, Freeholders, and Freedmen. . .[to protect] out Ancient Laws & Liberty. . . .[the volunteer members of which agreed to the following] And we do each of us, for ourselves respectively, promise and engage to keep a good Fire-lock in proper Order, & to furnish Ourselves as soon as possible with, & always keep by us, one Pound of Gunpowder, four Pounds of Lead, one Dozen Gunflints, & a pair of Bullet-Moulds, with a Cartouch Box, or powder horn, and Bag for Balls.\" I Mason, PAPERS, pp. 215-216 (1970).\n \n The RKBA was not suddenly created in Fairfax, Virginia by this agreement to maintain private firearms. It pre-existed the plan and was the right which made this plan of privately armed militia members feasible. \n \n Mason was not the only founder to embrace (without governmental direction) the \"gun right's ideology\" of making use of the individual RKBA and a privately armed populace prepared to defend liberty. Cornell also ignores the creation of Patrick Henry's \"Hanover Independent Militia Company,\" which caused Lord Dunmore, then royal governor of Virginia, to exclaim that its members:\n \n \"have taken up arms and styling themselves an Independent Company, have. . .put themselves in a posture for war.\" R. Meade, PATRICK HENRY, P. 53 (1969).\n \n And, if Cornell had looked, he would have seen that the Governor later complained:\n \n \"Every County is now Arming a Company of men whom they call an independent Company for the avowed purpose of protecting their Committee, and to be employed against Government if occasion require.\" J. Matthews, RICHARD HENRY LEE, p. 30 (1978)\n \n The \"gun right's ideology\" of an individual RKBA even found back-handed endorsement in a complaint made by the Continental Congress. It stemmed from an act in 1768 whereby the citizens of Boston called upon one another to arm themselves with privately held arms (as was their recognized pre-existing right):\n \n \"Instances of the licentious and outrageous behavior of the military conservators of the peace still multiply upon us, some of which are of such a nature, and have been carried to so great lengths, as must serve fully to evince that a late vote of this town, calling upon the inhabitants to provide themselves with arms for their defense, was a measure as prudent as it was legal. . . .It is a natural right which the people have reserved to themselves, confirmed by the Bill of Rights, to keep arms for their defense; and as Mr. Blackstone observes, it is to be made use of when the sanctions of society and law are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression.\" O. Dickerson ed., Boston Under Military Rule, p79 (1936) [quoting from what was at the time the most widely circulated periodical in the colonies, A Journal of the Times].\n \n These weapons were later taken by trickery in the first known \"registration and secured storage\" scheme imposed in America-generating the following Continental Congress complaint:\n \n \"The inhabitants of Boston being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their own effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations esteemed sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable effects behind.\" DECLARATION OF THE CAUSES AND NECESSITY OF TAKING UP ARMS (July 6, 1775).\n \n Now some of these examples involve governmental direction or organization and some do not-but every one of them shows the strength of the founder's \"gun right's ideology\" of condoning a broad pre-existing individual RKBA and making use of it when desired to create a militia organization. \n \n There are many, many more examples of the founder's belief in the \"gun right's ideology\" of the individual RKBA. Here are just two more examples:\n \n  \"SIR,\n Your letter of Sep. 15. 1777 from Paris comes safe to hand. . . . From the kind anxiety expressed in your letter as well as from other sources of information we discover that our enemies have filled Europe with Thrasonic accounts of victories they had never won and conquests they were fated never to make. While these accounts alarmed our friends in Europe they afforded us diversion. We have long been out of all fear for the event of the war. I enclose you a list of the killed, wounded, and captives of the enemy from the commencement of hostilities at Lexington in April, 1775, until November, 1777, since which there has been no event of any consequence. This is the best history of the war which can be brought within the compass of a letter. I believe the account to be near the truth, tho' it is difficult to get at the numbers lost by an enemy with absolute precision. Many of the articles have been communicated to us from England as taken from the official returns made by their General. I wish it were in my power to send you as just an account of our loss. But this cannot be done without an application to the war office which being in another county is at this time out of my reach. I think that upon the whole it has been about one half the number lost by them, in some instances more, but in others less. This difference is ascribed to our superiority in taking aim when we fire; every soldier in our army having been intimate with his gun from his infancy.\"\n Thomas Jefferson. Letter to Giovanni Fabbroni, Williamsburg, June 8, 1778, The Letters of Thomas Jefferson, 1743-1826.\n \n \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive.\" Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n \n Jefferson and Webster are here extolling (and likely also exaggerating) the very individual RKBA \"gun right's ideology\" which Cornell implies these same men must have rejected. \n \n I recognize that Cornell was making a point of the need for governmental regulation of a militia. I do not disagree with this position. I believe it was Socrates who said something to the effect of \"a disorganized mob is no more an army than a heap of stone building materials is a house.\" Cornell would likely agree with me that there is truth in that statement regardless of who said it. But when Cornell seeks to limit the relevance of revolutionary history to governmental regulation of the militia he forgets the pre-existing right which provided the source of the building materials the founders used in that organization: \n \n \"And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time.\" United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 179 (1939) \n \n The government absolutely has the authority to regulate the militia and the arms the militia uses. But Cornell's talk of tea parties and \"God save the Queen\" cannot hide his desire to have the militia \"tail\" wag the individual RKBA \"dog.\"",

   "This reminds of last week, when I went into a gun store (actually a pawn shop) and found a Steyr GB. The guy behind the counter was saying something to the effect that the ban on hi-cap magazines actually had some merit.\n \n I mean, WHY is this guy working in a gun store? \n \n First it's \"18 is too young to own firearms.\" Ok, but it's not too young to join the military? When I was 18, I had control of a 50 ton tank with a 105mm gun on it. Talk about damage ability.\n \n Then it's \"10 rounds is enough for civilians to have in their guns.\" Fine, you make the police and the criminals stop using hi-cap mags, and you might have a point. (They're civilians too.)\n \n In the mean time, I'm going to practice with my 18+1 shot Steyr GB and all my other pistols with hi-cap mags, and I'll be ready to defend myself.",

   " FEDERALIST No. 28 HAMILTON \n If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that \n  original right of self-defense \n which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. \n In a single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense. \n  The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair. \n The usurpers, clothed with the forms of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo.\n \n The obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase with the increased extent of the state, provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them. The natural strength of the people in a large community, in proportion to the artificial strength of the government, is greater than in a small, and of course more competent to a struggle with the attempts of the government to establish a tyranny.\n\n \n So How does Cornell explain this?",
