No Background Check, no ID, AND IT'S ALL LEGAL!\n\n \n If you don't like it, too bad. No laws were broken, nothing shady was done, there's no evidence that there's a problem. the Virginia Tech shooter didn't go to a gun show to acquire his weaponry, mandatory background checks wouldn't have done a bit of good. Even if they were in place he could have had a proxy do the shopping for him. Or he could've just bought them himself since he passed four background checks previously!\n \n There's nothing wrong with no background checks between private sales individuals. Despite all the hype and the crying, there's insufficient evidence to prove that undocumented transfers are a threat of serious significance. And all the bawling about terrorists and felons will get you nowhere. The vast majority of all sales at gun shows are fully legal, no laws are broken, most every person there is lawful in nature.\n \n Your constant approach amounts to amputation of the limb for a broken finger.",

The terrorists are making use of RPGs, anti-aircraft missiles and cannon, as well as fully automatic weapons and suicide bombers. I highly doubt that people named Achmed and Habib, are sneaking into this country, posing as Joe Average, searching out gun shows, and limiting themselves to non-military firearms.\n \n \npretend to be law abiding, and then purchase an AK47 assault rifle from a private seller.\n\n \n Assault rifles are military issue, capable of burst fire and fully automatic firing modes of operation. Weaponry available at gun shows are incapable of anything other than semi-automatic fire, as dictated by the ATF.\n \n If you don't believe it, go to a gun show and try to buy a fully-automatic AK-47, or an M249 SAW, or an Uzi, or a Sterling, or a Sten, or an M16.\n \n You won't find them though.

The loophole that exempts the military and police from whatever hair brained gun ban is brought along? The loophole that allows people like Major Hasan to be in possession of the M203 grenade launcher and M249 SAW?\n \n \nBut that must be what gun nuts want.\n\n \n We want to stop the bad guys as much as you do.

They just want the criminals and terrorists to have to buy their guns from their Drug dealing buddies. emoticon_wow\n \n They want Mexican Drug Gangs to also ship illegal weapons up with their drugs. They want us safe just like the Gun Controlled people of Mexico are. \n \n   What's wrong with Mexico: Corruption or American guns? \n Apparently, former CBP Commissioner Robert C. Bonner didn't read the   LA Times  report that cartels are now arming themselves with military weaponry via the international arms market.\n \n The   Los Angeles Times  reported today that Mexico is trying to resolve their police corruption epidemic through \"better screening and training of candidates\" and creating a \"new police model that stresses technical sophistication and trustworthiness and that treats police work as a professional career, not a fallback job.\"\n \n In April 2008,   USA Today  reported that \"one of Mexico's biggest drug cartels\" had begun a public advertising campaign to recruit Mexican army soldiers, promising better pay and food, housing for their families, and free cars.\n \n It appears that an unknown quantity of military weapons ended up in cartels' armories because they were brought along by defecting military or corrupt policemen.Mexico's corruption represents an opportunity to fabricate a \"reasonable\" excuse to sell gun control. But can something based upon denial result in anything positive?\n\n \n But there again, their problems with Drug Money corruption go Much further that just that!\n  Soldiers wary of often corrupt Mexican police  \nMONTERREY, Mexico - When soldiers tried to halt a suspicious-looking SUV that was being escorted through Monterrey by a state policeman, the officer radioed for backup. In minutes, police from 40 patrol cars surrounded the troops, drawing their guns and sending the soldiers diving for cover in an hour-long standoff.\n \n Confrontations like that are happening with increasing frequency in Mexico's wealthiest city as soldiers fight corrupt police officers helping drug cartels - in addition to taking on the drug dealers themselves.\n \n This year alone, police and soldiers have confronted one another more than 65 times, The Associated Press has learned - a growing and dangerous trend in the war on drugs.\n\n \n   Armed gang frees 53 Mexican prisoners: America's fault, too?  \n \n Not to mention that they are the cause of much of our crime problems here.   \n FBI: Burgeoning gangs behind up to 80% of U.S. crime \n \n The ONLY people disarmed by gun control is the law abiding!",

You keep talking about closing some non-existent loophole, but you have no answer for what to do when it comes to proxies undergoing the background checks.\n \n And let's not forget the Virginia Tech killer. He passed the background checks, undermining your whole argument and rendering it impotent.\n \n \nOr is it okay that such victims be sacrificed for an agenda?\n\n \n Your party seems to be sacrificing them, not ours. You exploit their loss to promote the loss of the rights of the living. You flood the media with never-ending tales of how they were killed, glorifying the killers, making them into posthumous legends that inspire other killers to go out and kill, kill, kill!

You obviously overlook the fact that Harris and Klebold intended to bomb the school with propane bottles which would have been more devastating. They and others in GUN FREE ZONES were victims of gun control by people like yourself with a bad case of VD. This recurring nightmare is lack of responsible people exercising their right therefore only maladjusted people can take advantage of victim disarmament zones.\n \n They were sacrificed on the alter you have chosen to worship, disarmed victims ripe for the killing. Everytime you point the finger, there are 4 pointed back at YOU! Tim McVeigh fired nary a shot but that doesn't suit your agenda does it.

   "  Bath School Massacre \n May of 1927 the Treasurer of the Bath, Michigan Consolidated School District blew up half of the school building (intending to have destroyed all of it). Within the hour he had committed suicide (and more murders) in the middle of the village by detonating explosives in his vehicle. In all, 45 people would be dead & many more would be injured in the worst instance of school violence in U.S. history.\n\n \n \n Most people do not know about the 93 bombs that the police found at Columbine. I hope people with criminal intent do not find out about this, but propane is extremely volatile and makes one of the best bombs. Anti-gunners. Do you lock up your propane in appropriate safes? I didn't think so! After all it not about actual and real safety. It is ONLY about banning guns.\n \n   The Depressive and the Psychopath \n They bragged about dwarfing the carnage of the Oklahoma City bombing and originally scheduled their bloody performance for its anniversary. Klebold boasted on video about inflicting \"the most deaths in U.S. history.\" Columbine was intended not primarily as a shooting at all, but as a bombing on a massive scale. If they hadn't been so bad at wiring the timers, the propane bombs they set in the cafeteria would have wiped out 600 people. \n \n After those bombs went off, they planned to gun down fleeing survivors. \n \n An explosive third act would follow, when their cars, packed with still more bombs, would rip through still more crowds, presumably of survivors, rescue workers, and reporters. The climax would be captured on live television. It wasn't just \"fame\" they were after-Agent Fuselier bristles at that trivializing term-they were gunning for devastating infamy on the historical scale of an Attila the Hun. Their vision was to create a nightmare so devastating and apocalyptic that the entire world would shudder at their power.\n",
