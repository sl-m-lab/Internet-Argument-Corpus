   "LIBERATING IRAQ\n \n Iraq has made startling progress on the road to democracy. Iraq has only been liberated from a long-standing dictatorship for a mere 15 months. It took a coalition of allied nations four long years to establish a sovereign democratic government in Germany and seven years to establish one in Japan after their people were liberated from their dictatorships by the coalition's military forces following World War II. However, we must keep in mind that democracy can be a very fragile thing. For instance, France has had five republics, two emperors, three kings, and a puppet dictatorship as their form of government since the United States first brought democracy back into the world. \n \n WHY IRAQ NEEDED TO BE LIBERATED\n \n 1. Saddam Hussein was the only living dictator to use Sarin Nerve Gas and Mustard Gas on his country's own civilian population to exterminate members of a disfavored ethnic minority.\n 2. Saddam Hussein was the only living dictator to attempt to assassinate a U.S. President and First Lady.\n 3. Saddam Hussein was actively seeking to purchase Uranium for his nuclear program.\n 4. Saddam Hussein enforced his regime through large-scale torture, mutilation of Iraqis, and frequent executions. Videotapes were made of his secret police slowly feeding Iraqis into wood-chippers and chopping off hands, feets, arms, legs, and other appendages. Government facilities had designated 'rape rooms'.\n 5. Saddam Hussein's sons and heirs to his throne were dangerously unstable rapists, mass-murderers, and sadists whose rule was predicted to be far more bloody than even their father's reign of terror. \n 6. Iraq's oil profits were being diverted away from benefiting the people so as to build elaborate palaces and provide opulent luxury to Saddam Hussein, his family, and his supporters. As a result, no attempt was made to build a diversified economy in Iraq which would avoid economic collapse when Iraq's oil supply finally runs out or alternative energy technologies are developed.\n \n WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION FOUND IN IRAQ SO FAR\n \n 1. Nearly 2 tons of Enriched Uranium\n 2. Sarin Nerve Gas\n 3. Mustard Gas\n 4. 1,000 high radiation components - potential 'dirty bomb' material\n 5. Nuclear Weapon Centrifuges\n \n ECONOMIC PRESSURE AND DEMOCRACY \n \n While capitalist democracies use incentives to encourage their population to invent new products, fulfill their potential, and work hard for the betterment of themselves and their families, dictatorships rely primarily on fear to force their populations to labor. Because each individual has a different level of ability, dictatorships are only able to extract a minimum level of labor from each person. Further, the more highly educated and the more raw genetic-ability a person has, the less expendable he becomes and the less effective such pressure becomes. As such, the populace in democracies are more productive, efficient, and inventive. This in turn exerts economic pressure on the dictatorships to make reforms. In extreme cases, such as the Soviet Union, this pressure can lead to the economic collapse of the dictatorships. In other cases, such as China, the pressure leads to the implementation of limited capitalist elements into the government while retaining a dictorial one-party system. In recent years, this economic pressure on dictatorships has decreased significantly as the democratic countries of the world increased the tax-burden on their populace and shackled businesses with steadily thickening webs of government regulations. Today, one-party dictatorships such as China are able to out-compete heavily-regulated and heavily-taxed democracies such as France.\n \n ECONOMIC PRESSURE AND OIL-BASED ECONOMIES\n \n A frequently asked question is why the economic pressure that led to the fall of the Soviet Union has not led the development of democracies in the Middle-East. The reason for the unusual temporary stability of the dictatorial governments there is simple. Oil. The dictatorships in that region have what could be called single-product oil-based economies. Oil is unusual in that it can be extracted by a small number of foreign workers and it can provide sufficient income for a dictatorship to maintain a military strong enough to quickly put down any popular uprising and to 'pay off' key influential portions of the populace. This frees the government from many of the traditional pro-democracy influences. By relying on a small number of foreign workers, they are spared the need to highly-educate their own populace and need not concern themselves with an idealistic pro-democracy student population. Because oil is a high-demand naturally-occurring product, the dictatorships need not be concerned with maintaining the high-level of technological advancement, a major advantage of democracies over dictatorships, needed to compete effectively in the global marketplace. The problem, of course, is that eventually either their oil will run out or new energy technology will be developed. When that occurs, the oil-dependent economies of the middle-east will collapse. If those economies have nuclear weapons, then they may try to black-mail the rest of the world into providing economic support (as North Korea is currently attempting) or launch wars of conquest in order to try to seize enough foreign resources to stabilize their economies. There have already been some technological advances that are likely to effect the demand for oil in the near future. Thermo-Depolyermization technology now allows the creation of light crude oil from carbon-rich garbage for about $15 a barrel, for example, and researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a new Ethanol-Hydrogen reactor small enough to fit into a car or basement that eliminates the need for bulky factories to produce hydrogen fuel.\n http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/11/1125_031125_turkeyoil.html\n http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/02/13/hydrogen.reactors.ap/\n \n Mark Harm\n Candidate for State Representative - Michigan\n http://www.markharm.com",
