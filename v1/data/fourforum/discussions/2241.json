The same would apply to exploration and view of tradition. I don`t really know what eggheaded is though emoticon_confused ;)\n \n Edit: The real problem with race is that it is such a large grouping. And it is not always geographicly centered and in many of those places where certain racial groups have co-existed alongside other races, the cultural differences have been quite negligable (there are of course expeptions to this as certain groups of gypsies in central europe).\n\n A large grouping is better than a small one for analysis, as long as it is meaningful. Analysts try to boil down the very complex world using categories that bring order to chaos. The broader the concept, the broader its explanatory power. One thing you learn is any theory class is the broader the scope of the theory, the better the theory. \n \n I won't deny that ethnicity is an important concept, but I think the racial idea should be considered more because, for one thing, I never see people considering things in these terms. It is an interesting question, and looking at the sweep of history, I'm not so sure the differences are trivial. \n \n By eggheadism, I am thinking of things like unrealistic idealism and nerdishness. By the way, there may be many other possible differences; my list was just off the top of my nerdish head.",

   "Hunting and gardening aren't the only parts of indigenous culture. Neither is early death a cultural thing, prior to colonization death rates were equal to or better than Europeans. \n\n Death rates tended to be lower among American Indians than people in Europe because they did not have the technology and social organization to produce enough food to support large, dense populations that spread disease--hardly a compliment to the Indians.\n \n \n\n In fact many Europeans (the smart ones IMO) chose to leave their settler communities to join local First Nations for the higher level of freedom from bureaucracy, European \"morality\", and other disagreeable aspects of European culture.\n \n\n Since your type is so enamored with American Indians I'll have to cite them when arguing against big government. Yeah, I might have joined the Indians too; farming is much harder work than hunting and gardening; I wouldn't have been too keen on the whole infanticide thing though.\n \n \n\n LOL, you're just embarrassing yourself every time you make assumptions about me galton. I can safely say I know far more than you about what people from the \"Third World\" as you call it (the majority of the world, that is) think about American culture. Few of my friends are exclusively European descendants, and I've lived in all kinds of places you couldn't imagine. The honest truth is that the majority of the world is being force-fed \"American culture\", and they are on the whole not impressed.\n \n\n Yeah, using the term \"Third World\"--god, is that out of left field or what?! And I why am I not surprised that you have few European-descended friends--you're not the type that likes to go slumming, right? And that is a real shocker that the type of people you would gravitate to wouldn't care for America. \n \n \n\n All that aside, I notice that you aren't bothering to disguise your opinion that Euro-American cultural is superior with calls to \"assimilate into local culture\" anymore. At least that's honest.\n\n When it comes to culture, I am basically a pragmatist. I don't believe that any way of life is intrinsically superior, but cultures differ in what they produce, and American (and European) culture best provide me what I value which are shown in the following facts:\n \n From http://nebula.worldbank.org/Website/index.htm#\n \n Health: America has one of the highest levels of life expectancy and one of the lowest levels of infant mortality in the world.\n \n From www.freedomhouse.org/research/freeworld/2003/table.pdf\n \n Freedom: America scores at the highest level for both political rights and civil liberties.\n \n From www.uis.unesco.org\n \n Education: America has among the highest levels of education in the world. \n \n Science: America has among the highest number of scientists and engineers in the world and devotes resources to science, research, and development at the highest level in the world.\n \n Yeah, I could see why other countries wouldn't want our way of life (or that of European countries); I'm an odd duck in valuing health, freedom, education, and science.",

You seem to be saying that, while we share the same social system (like the level of technology for example), any general culture should be a combination of all groups. Well I'm all for everyone working together toward a common culture that keeps America great, but an essential aspect of any general culture is how it sees its past and heritage. And the truth is that the people, the ideas, the religion, the technology, the traditions. etc. that were the basis of the social system that led to the development of one of the leading countries in the world were European, specifically English. Those early folks were the architects of the great structure we see now that is called America. Many groups over the years have been adopted into that system, and we have evolved and changed with each new generation, but the design that has led to all the success we have seen has always been there.\n \n So yes, a person whose family has been in the country only a generation can be as American as someone who can trace his ancestors to the Mayflower. In truth, he can be more of an American, because in my view, you are an American to the extent that you love the nation's architects. You are an American if your chest swells with pride as you contemplete America's flowering over the centuries. You are an American if you get misty-eyed as you witness her Spirit rolling forth. You are an American if your deepest desire is to see her prosper and succeed into the future. If these are you feelings, you and I are comrades, and we have no conflicts over culture. \n \n If on the other hand, your devote your energies to finding ways to demonize the nation's architects, its history, its heritage, its way of life, the elements of its past that were essential in making it the success it is; if your desire is to take a wrecking ball to its foundations, so you can erect a different structure in its place, then you and I are rivals, and I will contest you at every opportunity.\n \n What I can't stand is the native-born citzen who hates the American system but who makes his living here anyway, or the immigrant who comes here, not because he has an affinity for America, but because he sees it as a big fat ATM.

I agree we should all learen english but to say other cultures are unacceptable is not American unless you beleive AMerica is for white assimilation only!\n\n \n The concept of 'the melting pot' was fashionable about 100 years ago. It stated that due to massive immigration, multiple cultures should come together in America, get mixed, and then melded so one uniform culture would emerge. This new culture will consist of only the best qualities of each component culture. The poorer elements will be dropped from each culture. Over time a culture superior to that anywhere else in the world will emerge, solely because American culture is an amalgam of only the superior elements of all of those cultures. This new culture will enable America to become the dominant force on the planet to do good and lift the rest of the world above themselves. \n \n Note, this view mandates that 'European Americans' assimilate the best qualities of other cultures. Teddy Roosevelt, an ardent 'Melting Pot' proponent, believed that Native Americans had quite a lot to offer from their culture such as bravery, love of strenous activity, and an indominatable fighting spirit. Similarly, other 'Melting Pot' theorists also looked towards other non-European Cultures to add desirable traits. Jews for their love of learning and scholarship, Africans for their musical and artistical ability, East Asians for their strong work ethic, and so on.\n \n Note: I am not espousing these theories as personal belief. I am merely presenting the information as edification.\n \n Taking a more critical look at this theory, one would clearly realize that it didn't quite pan out that way. A more recently used analogy to describe American culture is \"Salad Bowl\" (or the 'hotdish' model if you are from Minnesota). In this analogy there are many componants to American culture that don't meld together but through remaining unique add to the experience. \n \n If you are looking for a pretty thorough deconstruction and critical analysis of the 'melting pot' theory of culture in the United States I would suggest \"The American Crucible\" by Gary Gerstle. I realize this book has some shortcomings, (notably that it is incredibly liberal in outlook) but he does make some valid points regarding the nature of the 'melting pot' theory.\n \n Whistler",

   "I know whta you think American culture is. I've noticed something about America. That most Americans have no culture. I go to California. Most everyone there acts the same. I go to Texas, the same thing. I go to Pittsburgh. The same thing.\n \n I visit Mexicans is Mexico. I visit Mexicans in the California. They act liek Mexicans in Mexico. I visit Mexicans in North DAkota. They act like Mexicans in California and Mexico.\n \n I see the kids around me. They act the same as each other. I go somewhere new in teh US. The kids are similar geographically. They are influenced by things regional more than anything.\n \n I visit my cousins ins Hawaii, Cali, and TExas. Guess what they act like me. None of us act like the kids around us. Why? Because we share the same culture. We sahre the same technology as everyone else but have different culture.\n\n \n Sounds about right to me. As diverse as the US is geographically and even culturally, there are common ties of culture that bind all Americans, and IMHO, those ties are what make Americans Americans.\n \n The fact that you and your family are different is not bad, it's good. I'm a 5ht or 6th generation Scot, marrying a 2nd generation Italian, and let me tell you, culturally, we couldn't be much more different. We have no problems, each has their family identity, and each is accepted, neither tries to force their culture upon the other, neither is viewed as superior. Most importantly, we are both strong CANADIAN families. We both realize that we are Canadians first. \n \n \nMinorities are Americans, and as Americans, they are expected to act as other Americans. That's a pretty simple concept.\n Minorities act as other Americans. So Blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Polynesians, and every other minority si suppose to act like other Americans, which leaves us with....? What? Whites? Europeans? That is how we're suppose to act? So much for the melting pot. \n \n \n Exactly. \n \n Like I said before, America has a strong European influence, it comes with the territory. The simple fact is, Europeans founded this nation, and as such they made the rules and those rules defined our culture. Many other aspects of other cultures have been incorporated into the European model, and that combination is what makes America distinct.\n \n American is too geographical diverse to have one single dominant culture, it obviously varies considerably according to geography.\n \n \nI think hyphenated Aemricans are the problem. WE're all from somewhre else. So let's guess say we're Italian, japanese, Nigerian, Hawaiian, Cuban, and whatever else we are. WE are all Americans with roots somewhere else. You may believe that you're roots are meaningless. I do not. I do not want to give up my identity for someone else's. I'm as much American as someone that's been here since 1776. That's what Aemrica is all about.\n\n \n I believe my roots are VERY important, but not more important than my allegiance to my current country of residence and its associated culture. If I was a Scot first, then I guess I should be moving back to Scotland. I realize that I can't expect the majority to change to my wishes and background, but that I instead must conform to, even tolerate, the majority.\n \n No one is persecuting you or asking you to abandon your heritage, that's a misconception.\n \n Waxy",

So instead of regional separation, you get white flight out of the big cities as minorities have moved in, producing somewhat segregated neighborhoods. \n \n The one region that could grow increasingly separate in its culture and people is the Southwest. There are very large Hispanic--mostly Mexican--populations in states like CA and NM. Whites are leaving CA for other states as immigrants move in, so the day could arrive when the southwest is largely immigrant and mostly of Mexican ancestry. It is possible that multiculturalism will encourage them to maintain a Mexican culture, and it is even conceivably that decades from now that region will become unhappy with the domination from the rest of the country, and some might desire to secede like the Southern U.S. 150 years ago. Now this may seem farfetched now, but I'm talking about trends that if continued could lead to something like this in several decades.",

And the truth is that the people, the ideas, the religion, the technology, the traditions. etc. that were the basis of the social system that led to the development of one of the leading countries in the world were European, specifically English.

This new culture will consist of only the best qualities of each component culture. The poorer elements will be dropped from each culture. Over time a culture superior to that anywhere else in the world will emerge, solely because American culture is an amalgam of only the superior elements of all of those cultures. This new culture will enable America to become the dominant force on the planet to do good and lift the rest of the world above themselves. \n \n Note, this view mandates that 'European Americans' assimilate the best qualities of other cultures. Teddy Roosevelt, an ardent 'Melting Pot' proponent, believed that Native Americans had quite a lot to offer from their culture such as bravery, love of strenous activity, and an indominatable fighting spirit. Similarly, other 'Melting Pot' theorists also looked towards other non-European Cultures to add desirable traits. Jews for their love of learning and scholarship, Africans for their musical and artistical ability, East Asians for their strong work ethic, and so on.\n \n Note: I am not espousing these theories as personal belief. I am merely presenting the information as edification.\n \n Taking a more critical look at this theory, one would clearly realize that it didn't quite pan out that way. A more recently used analogy to describe American culture is \"Salad Bowl\" (or the 'hotdish' model if you are from Minnesota). In this analogy there are many componants to American culture that don't meld together but through remaining unique add to the experience. \n \n If you are looking for a pretty thorough deconstruction and critical analysis of the 'melting pot' theory of culture in the United States I would suggest \"The American Crucible\" by Gary Gerstle. I realize this book has some shortcomings, (notably that it is incredibly liberal in outlook) but he does make some valid points regarding the nature of the 'melting pot' theory.\n \n\n I agree to your view for the mostpart. The part I think is different is that we don't come to this oucntry and drop ours and pick up another. I think immigrants come here and teach their kids and then their kids pick up new things and add it to their culture. Then the country is full of poeple that are different in many ways but yet have similarities.\n \n I don't know how this is suppose to be a melting pot if someone comes to this country and is suppose to be given culture but never gets to shar theirs.",

   "Sounds about right to me. As diverse as the US is geographically and even culturally, there are common ties of culture that bind all Americans, and IMHO, those ties are what make Americans Americans.\n \n The fact that you and your family are different is not bad, it's good. I'm a 5ht or 6th generation Scot, marrying a 2nd generation Italian, and let me tell you, culturally, we couldn't be much more different. We have no problems, each has their family identity, and each is accepted, neither tries to force their culture upon the other, neither is viewed as superior. Most importantly, we are both strong CANADIAN families. We both realize that we are Canadians first. \n \n \n \n Exactly. \n \n Like I said before, America has a strong European influence, it comes with the territory. The simple fact is, Europeans founded this nation, and as such they made the rules and those rules defined our culture. Many other aspects of other cultures have been incorporated into the European model, and that combination is what makes America distinct.\n \n American is too geographical diverse to have one single dominant culture, it obviously varies considerably according to geography.\n \n \n \n I believe my roots are VERY important, but not more important than my allegiance to my current country of residence and its associated culture. If I was a Scot first, then I guess I should be moving back to Scotland. I realize that I can't expect the majority to change to my wishes and background, but that I instead must conform to, even tolerate, the majority.\n \n No one is persecuting you or asking you to abandon your heritage, that's a misconception.\n \n \n\n \n Waxy I think we agree on it for the most part. I think fundametally we see everything the same. Weird huh? We agree on something.",

   "you just said the wrong thing right there. You say that your environ changes your culture (I'm sorry, influences) Then you say that mexicans have the same culture even if they are in different places. They have the same culture in mexico and alaska. That is what you are saying. I want to tell us which one it really is instead of trying to say that we don't know what culture is. We know what culture is, you need to learn.\n\n I think you do not know what culture is. Protocols for cultures usually expand all regions. Here in the US most \"white Americans\" don't have a strong sense of culture because their protocols are mostly influenced by local factors as opposed to people wiht strong cultural identities that are the same regardless of geography.",

In turn they assimilated the best traits of all the other cultures before them. It is a bi-directional model in theory. \n \n In practice the 'melting pot' transformation never occured. Immigrants and non-immigrants did not mix together and forge a coherent 'American culture' in the classic sense of the word. (One could make a pretty strong argument that America's current primary cultural marker is consumerism, but that is not seen as a traditional cultural-esque value.) There are many reasons for this lack of melding on all sides of the issue. Certain groups wished to remain together, other groups wished for those groups to remain separate unto themselves, blatent racism/ethnicism, geographic obstacles, linguistic barriers, and so on.\n \n The primary reason, in my opinion, the melting pot theory didn't work is explained by the dual nature of culture. While culture is a group phenomenon it is transmitted through an individual's interactions with others. This can be as simple as parent-to-child or as complex as businessperson to employee. But without a uniform distribution of individuals, with respect to cultural background, throughout the population as a whole this model cannot work. It is my guess that people at the time didn't quite understand the mechanisms of acculturation otherwise they would not have proposed such a far-fetched theory.\n \n Whistler",

   "If you beleive that Native Americans came from somewhere else than I guess we should eliminate indigenous from the dictionary becaue nothing would be indigenous to America.\n\n \n A more appropriate term to describe Native Americans would be Aboriginal Americans. The definition of aboriginal from Merriam-Webster is \"being the first or earliest known of its kind present in a region\".\n \n The term native is more associated with the circumstances of one's birth. Native, as reported by Merriam-Webster, is : \"belonging to a particular place by birth...and...belonging to or associated with one by birth\". \n \n In the strictest sense of the words you and I are both native Americans. However the political meaning of the words is quite different than the literal meaning. \n \n The meaning of indigenous is more vague that either aboriginal or native: having originated in and being produced, growing, living, or occurring naturally in a particular region or environment. In the most common sense of the word the human specie is not indiginous to the Americas, Europe, Asia, or Australia. Rather our species is indiginous to Africa alone (according to our best understanding of anthropology).\n \n Whistler\n \n \n \n \n PS I will say it chirps me off when someone refers to me as being European American.",

That is not being biased toward whites, it's just learning how to read the English language.\n\n Why is it then that teh biggest correlation then is not race but income? it jsut happens taht most minorities are lower income so they do worse? \n http://www.sq.4mg.com/IQincome.htm\n \n \n \n \n There are whites out there who are the same way. You shouldn't be applying to Harvard or Yale if you can't speak English properly. This will show in your test results.\n\n that is true but when you use subject matter such as regattas, investments, and other things commonly associated wiht higher incomes it is bias.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n This is used to make people think about what the best answer is. It used to see how they will react to certain situations. I can't believe you actually believe that some of these things are biased. If you have to claim that \"standardized\" tests are biased to help out other people, you have serious problems. The test is actually biased towards people who are smart; it separates the elite from the average. Get some help. \n\n \n If you can;t copmprehend how tehre could be a bias then how can I help you out. If you jsut say oh teh people taht do the best are the smartest then of course you don;t see teh bias. Men do better than women on the SAT's but way out perform them in college. /so what does that mean?",

   "Wow, I tried to read your post, but somehow your lack of grammar made it hard to do so. So, I am going to do my best to interpret it.\n \n \n \n \nWhy is it then that teh biggest correlation then is not race but income? it jsut happens taht most minorities are lower income so they do worse? \n http://www.sq.4mg.com/IQincome.htm?\n\n \n \n The SAT is a STANDARDIZED test. So if you claim that words like \"regatta\" are only going to be known by those with higher incomes, what do you propose to do to fix that? Only allow those under a certain income to take it? Give the poor a certain number of points extra to compensate? I am not rich nor do I own a boat, but I know what a regatta is. That is a terrible example of trying to explain what biased is. And then having the guts to say \"Directions Bias Test directions involve linguistic complexities unfamiliar to the examinee, e.g., \"None of the following is true except . . .\" is incorrectly interpreted as \"all of the following are true except\"\". If you can speak any lick of English, you should be able to understand that. My 10 year old cousin knows what that says. And don't blame how you were brought up or in what environment you were brought up in as a means to show bias. \n \"Linguistic Bias Test presumes that examinee is competent in standard English, e.g., \"Which sentence is ungrammatical? a) They saw Rose. b) You done it wrong. c) My brother has never eaten. d) Don't use too much.\" A nonstandard English speaker might see each as grammatical.\" Just because the people they grew up with or the environment they grew up in made them speak a certain way, that doesn't make the test biased. In US schools, US English is taught. If your first language isn't English, then you take a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) instead of the SAT. Maybe they need to make one for those who speak Ebonics, that way those who don't speak US English can stop complaining about the SAT being biased.\n \n \n \nthat is true but when you use subject matter such as regattas, investments, and other things commonly associated wiht higher incomes it is bias.\n\n \n \n Those words aren't too difficult. Loan, regatta, boat, stock, etc. Those are fairly common words. Shouldn't you know those words by the time you are in 11th grade (age 17)? If not, you're not going to learn it in college. They will expect that you know what they are. The test is to separate the elite from the average, and the average from the weak. If there were words like \"house\" and \"car\", everyone would do extremely well and there would be no point for the test because it wouldn't show anything.\n \n \n \n \n \nIf you can;t copmprehend how tehre could be a bias then how can I help you out. If you jsut say oh teh people taht do the best are the smartest then of course you don;t see teh bias. Men do better than women on the SAT's but way out perform them in college. /so what does that mean?\n\n \n \n \n First, try to at least spell the words close to their proper way. That said, I can comprehend bias. Using the word \"regatta\" is by no means biased. How do women outperform men in college? What do you base that on? GPA, exit exams, graduate prep tests (GMAT, LSAT, etc), or what? There is no way to gauge that. Even if women did best, what are you trying to prove by that. My argument was that the SAT is about as standardized as it can get. I didn't say anything about women or men in it.",

   "I tend to think that the general american white man (or argueable any man) is a void at birth, with no specific attributes as inherent; these are earned or boasted on them with experience, time, and knowledge. Out of all the races, white people seem to be outside of all the boxes, yet we have our own new paradigms of living. \n \n In the coarse of thirty years, think about how the general culture of white people has changed. I do not believe most countries have changed as much as America, and mostly because of it's dynamics. I do believe this won't be isolated to white people only, yet I believe the white culture has embraced an individualist view, more so than any other--perhaps more appropriately a rebellious point of view.\n \n \n I live in the most diverse area in the world, and I can honestly tell you that many people within certain races seem almost stereotypical, (this is even true of white people). Although with each new generation there seems to be a different perspective, and a relief from past traditions; where each individual is forced to ask themself, 'what am I? what should I do with my life?'\n \n Within every other country or culture it's assigned to you, but for white people it's less than, (atleast from what I've seen). 'Making yourself' isn't a natural part of the human trend, it's a survival characteristic that involves the use of the brain. I tend to think that white people that have been here for sometime, are better off, since they must fill that void with their own interests, and desires. \n \n For better or for worse, the white culture is the leading component in America--maybe the world; and I happen to believe that this brand of 'individualism' is grand, just because it invokes the conciousness. Now only if it remains rational and social.",

   "For whatever it's worth culture is the way of life of a people including its customs, traditions, dress, food, technology, social institutions, and language. Language is the cornerstone of the culture of a people. There is no such thing as a \"white culture\". What most posters are referring to is \"American culture\". Dominant members (those in power) of a society are those who set the standards and establish the values and norms of that society. In the case of America, the dominant members were Europeans, especially those from England. They established the culture based on what they agreed with from their original countries or what they disagreed with from same countries. The culture was set based on their perception of their world at the time. This is not to say what they did or did not do is good or bad, it just is. As groups from other parts of the world moved in the culture changed in some ways to reflect the newcomers (especially in the areas of food and dress). Each new group arriving impacted the culture in some way. The first thing groups used to do (up until about 50 years ago) was to anglocise their name and to learn English so they would fit in better and have more opportunities. BTW there were no ESL classes back then, so it was even more inconvenient to learn the language. I personally love the additions and changes to our culture over the years that have come from the various immigrant groups. \n \n There is still, however, going to be an undeniable European/English flavor to the American culture because the constructs of the main social institutions were developed by that particular group. Americans who already live here and immigrants who move here have one of two choices, either adapt to the standards of the society or change them. Adapting to a culture does not mean that one has to give up their original culture, it means that one adds to their total culture. Surely, most of us have had to adapt to the majority around us at some point in time. One thing a society has to have to survive is cohesion on basic principles, better known as group concensus.\n \n In addressing the standardized test issue, one thing that has happened in schools is that we have \"dummied down\" the curriculum so much that students don't have to perform to pass because this might hurt their self-esteem. I am continually amazed at my students lack of general vocabulary when trying to explain a concept in Sociology or World History. I define more general vocabulary than I do jargon associated with the actual field of study.",
