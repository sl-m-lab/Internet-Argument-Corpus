   "If you truly believe Huckabee will shrink the size of government I think you're insane, VT.\n \n All republicans will mouth that they are \"small government conservatives\" but when it comes to the specifics, they can only promise more spending.\n \n Now I don't think he would be as bad as let's say Giuliani, since while Huckabee is unprincipled and seems to work on the basis of \"If it sounds good, do it\", Rudy has principles, they're just entirely big-government police-state principles.\n I still don't understand this \"principles\" thing you claim Huckabee lacks. Is this just a gut feeling or do you really have some issues that lead you to believe this? \n \n \nTax rises would be very problematic at the moment, even if used to actually reduce the deficit and not just maintain it while financing more expenditure. The central bank has inflationary concerns, but it is being forced to lower interest rates anyway to try to ward off recession. Inflict further pain on the economy with taxes and the central bank will be cutting rates even further to stop this from happening, you'll have inflation in the double digits coupled with falling wages.\n \n The only answer is to cut spending, especially spending overseas. That means shut down the foreign bases, leave Iraq, Afghanistan, Korea, Japan, Europe in general, eliminate the foreign aid to petty tyrants across africa and south america. \nActually, even if Huckabee did raise taxes (or request this) then it wouldn't be too problematic so long as he also lowered spending with it. Even so, Huckabee has stated the problem is overspending and not undertaxing. \n \n Personally, I don't think we are overtaxed or undertaxed when looking at a year to year prospective but considering it is debt that drives wages lower and the dollar into less value, it may be needed that we cut and tax to ensure a more stable future. This is a long sighted stance as opposed to a short sided stance of not raising taxes and not reducing spending to make people in the current year happy. \n \n My stance is not alone either, it is what the GAO has been saying for years (see GAO fiscal wake up tour).",
