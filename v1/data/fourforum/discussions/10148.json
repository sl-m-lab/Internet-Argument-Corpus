Time after time those most vocal about the perils of \"loose morals\" were themselves diddling strangers and engaging in the very behaviors they were telling others were morally reprehensible. The next time you hear someone telling you how allowing gays to marry each other would threaten your marriage and the very foundations of America, you are probably going to ask yourself \"I wonder what he is covering up?\"\n \n The preachers of values-they-don't-practice will try to make it about what went wrong for the individuals caught in their own hypocrisy, but that is yet more ######## wrapped in religion. It isn't about them, it is about the rules of the sex game itself.\n \n As a people, we have been goaded, cajoled and misled into an insane web of laws and rules about sexual behavior. Insane because they are contrary to human nature and their real purpose is to manipulate people through fear and guilt.\n \n Let's face it - sex is necessary, healthy and fun; which explains exactly why there are so many laws to control it. With so much going for it, controlling sex is the easiest way to control people. Mind you I said control people not sex itself, because as we know from the millennia, it is not possible to control sex.\n \n In fact, from the evidence of the very people most intent on limiting sexual behavior of the rest of us, they have no intent on controlling sex. They have shown themselves to be enthusiastic participants in every variety of sexual behavior, from sucking #### in public restrooms to getting spanked by prostitutes. Priests tell their flock the virtues of abstinence while bedding the altar boys. Politicians decry same gender sex while hiring male prostitutes. It is beyond hypocrisy, it is about controlling you and me through fear and intimidation.\n \n America has always had some strange notions about sex from its earliest foundations. Exactly what purpose does the state have in regulating what you and I may want to do with our bodies? Why should either federal or state governments be permitted to say anything at all about what we want to do sexually? I say except for a very few instances, the state has no right to say anything whatsoever.",
