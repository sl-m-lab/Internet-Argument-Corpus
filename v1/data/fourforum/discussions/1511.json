   "At present, it's hard to tell. As was previously mentioned we are still highly vulnerable, although with the new security it's difficult for many people that aren't caucasian to enter the United States without heavy scrutiny.\n \n Aside from the $200 Billion expended on this ostensible \"War on Terror\", as well as the 496 deaths, I'd say it's been fairly successful.\n \n However, I don't agree with some of the measures they're taking for security. I understand that it's to prevent and quell any potential terrorist attacks, but it's discriminative, In my opinion.\n \n I think, at the time of the attacks, this would seem to be the most expedient of choices. We endeavored to break down the al-Qaida network and I'd assume we've done well in preventing domestic attacks because there haven't been any. But there has been a great deal of deaths in Afghanistan, especially since the ratification of their new constitution. I think forty-people have been murdered since their new constitution, obviously al-Qaida extremists.\n I'm very dismayed at the fact that Bush has chosen to digress from the terror issue and go after Saddam when it was Osama Bin Laden whom was directly behind the 9/11 attacks. \n \n I think many middle-easterners' malice and hatred towards us will mount with this invasion, but it's difficult to tell at present.

Where is their army? wheres their country? In vietnam you knew where the enemy was and you took the war to them, but with terrorism, you dont know where they are, so how can you fight them?\n\n \n There was an enemy then just like there is today, but neither dressed like regular army. We know where the enemies came from in Vietnam just like we do today, but neither are easy to find. There are barriers today just like there were in Vietnam, but just neither time were the barriers able to really able to protect us. But I disagree that their were borders in either war. The borders only exist in a 'normal' war where both sides stand up and fight each other in an organized manner. In Vietnam the enemy was everywhere so how can you say there was a border at all? You couldn't map their progress nor can you map the progress of the terrorists today. So I see a lot of relation between Vietnam and the war on terrorism today only this is on a larger scale. As for taking the war to the enemy, we know where the enemy is. Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabit, and so on. The problem is that these are individuals that we are fighting, not a country. We cannot simply try and kill all our enemies even if we know where they are unlike we could in Vietnam. We have to direct this war with the help of other governments.\n \n \nOne minute there in Afghanistan, then Iraq, then Syria then Iran, Egypt maybe?\n\n \n They are not just showing up there, they have been there for years but we just didn't care.\n \n \nThis isnt a war as the true meaning of the word is, its a war on terror, a bit like the cold war, was the cold war a real war? i dont think so.\n\n \n The Vietnam war was technically not a war at all. It was a police action just as the Korean war was. Not all things you would call a war were actually wars in the first place. Anyways, I have a broad definition of what a war is similar to the guys who called Vietnam a war and the tension between the US and Russia a war. The Cold War was a war but it was one of politics. Democracy was at war with communism all over the world. Countries rose and fell and borders as well as power shifted for years during this war. Really it could have been called WWIII in that way.\n \n \nI stated the british fought with the IRA for 30 years, in the end that war wasnt won by either side, a compromise was found, do you think that this may happen with america?\n\n \n Do you believe that the US would accept a compromise based on what you have seen?

The war on terrorism is being fought with military power. The war on terror involves enemies hiding and they also have weapons such as tanks and missiles hence the war in Afghanistan. They are also backed by countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and many of the enemies of Israel. Are you trying to show that there is in some way a difference between the Vietnam war and the war on terrorism in any of these ways? I sure don't see the difference other than this is being played on a much large scale making things a whole lot more complicated than Vietnam was.\n \n \nSo wheres the enemy now, wheres the terrorist?\n\n \n If you want me to point to where one is check the mountains of Pakistan near the border of Afghanistan and for another just see Arafat.\n \n \nAll im saying is dont become paranoid, the whole world isnt against america, only a few mad muslims, but the actions you are taking ,you are making more enemys instead of friends. Neutral muslims are now sympathisers with terrorist and if you continue being paranoid your going to make more enemys.\n\n \n Of course we are only dealing with a few bad apples but the trouble is that many of these bad apples are in control of many other people such as the Taliban was and Saddam was. We had to attack and defeat two entire nations just to get at a few people and of course we cannot continue to do this. That is part of the complexity of this situation.\n \n \nIraq was totaly unecessary, all Bush has achieved there is making more enemies, its clear that war, sorry invasion,was planned before 9/11.\n\n \n I don't see it as clear that the war was planned before 9/11 although it may have been. Either way the reasoning for the war was made all the stronger by the events of 9/11. I don't support Bush stating that the war was about WMDs when it really wasn't but I do support our action there. The world is now safer because Saddam is no longer in power and now we have a chance to bring democracy to a turbulant Middle East.\n \n \nAlianating france and other countries is not helping you, they were against invading iraq, not against terrorism.\n\n \n I wish we could have worked with France in the war in Iraq but they wanted no part of it. The war was in our best interest and France simply was against what was in our best interest. When it comes down to that we simply have to tell them sorry but we have to look out for ourselves if you're not going to help us.

Also we clearly live in a country that is having a hard time accepting that our own military forces are dying in order to aid another people such as the Iraqis. It is the opinion of the people that war is only necessary when it's benefits to the people can be clearly shown.\n\n \n America has already intervened hevily in Israel We finance the israeli government, we provide them with their weapons and we have kept the UN from intervening there. If the US did not keep padding the resolutions against Israel, this would have been over a long time ago.",

   "I think Aries has a good point about not being able to fight an emotion or a concept. That's why I see the war on terror as having two different aspects:\n \n 1) The neutralization of current terrorist groups and harboring or aiding states. This will usually mean the use of military force to kill or capture, but also disrupting their flow of communications and funding. We can't just look at this as 'let's kill all the terrorists,' because you will never ever be able to. You need to kill or capture the ones you can, and hamper the abilities of the others.\n \n 2) Change perception. This aspect is absolutely critical and often overlooked. You can go out and kill 10,000 terrorist fighters, but how many more do you create in doing that? We need to let people see that the US is not the devil incarnate, that we're not evil imperialists. What we essentially need to do is change the way these people think, especially the younger generations. All they have now are radical clerics and state-run propoganda, and they don't have access to any other point of view. I think that the key to this step is free media in the Middle East. Al-Jazeera, while pretty biased, is laying the groundwork for this. It's also why it is so imperative that we succeed in Iraq and win the hearts and minds of the people, so they would have good opinions of Americans, and these ideas would slowly begin to spread throughout the region.\n \n The problem we often have is a balance between the two of these aspects.",

If you think WAY back to afghanistan, Bush himself commended Al Jazeera on their impartiality. I watch Al Jazeera pretty often, and their reports seem to be verifiable, factual, and usually includes video evidence. They are not always the stories that we would prefer that they report, they are not usually strongly biased. You se a lot of the same stories on AJ that you see on MSNBC or fox, just without the spin (such as AJ doesn;t insist on calling the insurgents \"terrorists\" and does not coninually harp on \"foreign fighters\"). You ge one more thing from AJ that you don;t get with American media, which is direct interviews with Iraqis. \n \n You are definatly right about needing to win the war first and foremost in the court of public opinion. It seems we are doing a pretty poor ob of that right now. IF you have discovery times (TV channel) there is a pretty interesting show on right now called \"Al Queda 2.0\" and another called \"Te real Saddam\"a that are pretty interesting and worth watching.\n \n I participate in some Arab language forums, and from what I have seen on them, Arab opinion of the US right now is really low.",

By assuming retaliation against us is due to Islamic extremists just disliking the US as an entity is naive. Why are we declaring a war on terror and what created that war? To win any war the goals of an enemy must be defeated. Our last war was declared on the basis of non-existant WMDs and fully supported by a gullible public. The war on terror is based on equally shaky ground, our foreign policy, and not winable in the conventional sense we view as winning.
