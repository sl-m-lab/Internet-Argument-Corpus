   "Recently, I got this email:\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Recently Marines over in Iraq supporting this country in OIF wrote to \n Starbucks because they wanted to let them know how much they liked \n their coffee and try to score some free coffee grounds. Starbucks wrote \n back telling the Marines thanks for their support in their business, \n but that they don't support the War and anyone in it and that they \n won't send them the Coffee. So as not to offend them we should not \n support in buying any Starbucks products. As a War vet and writing to \n you patriots I feel we should get this out in the open. I know this War \n might not be very popular with some folks, but that doesn't mean we \n don't support the boys on the ground fighting street to street and house \n to house for what they and I believe is right. If you feel the same as \n I do then pass this along, or you can discard it and I'll never know. \n Thanks very much for your support to me, and I know you'll all be there \n again here soon when I deploy once more. \n \n Semper Fidelis, \n \n Sgt Howard C. Wright \n 1st Force Recon Co \n 1st Plt PLT RTO \n \n Jackson Davis\n Great Plains Direct, Inc.\n voice (913) 492-1237\n fax (913) 492-8650 \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Is this true? Can anybody vouch for this?\n I emailed Starbucks to get a verification, but I highly doubt I'll get a reply.\n I can't believe that Starbucks would (a) be heartless toward soldiers that just want a taste of home, something to comfort them in war (b) would try to make some political statement by withholding their precious coffee from someone. It's not THAT great. \n \n Well, If anyone can tell me the veracity of this story, please do.\n If I get a response from Starbucks I'll put it up here (if I remember).\n \n .",
