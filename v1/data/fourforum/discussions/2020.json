   "In the case of In the case of PETERSON v. HEWLETT-PACKARD CO., No. 01-35795 (9th Cir. January 2004). Attorneys for the Plaintiff, (Peterson) argued that the Plaintiff held a constitutional right to display anti-gay biblical scriptures in his cubicle in opposition to the Company's diversity program that supported gay and lesbian people in the workplace. The plaintiff claimed, in part, that Hewlett-Packard's workplace diversity campaign was \"a cursade to converst fundamentalist Christians to its values,\" including the promotion of \"the homosexual lifestyle.\" \n \n The Court held in relevant part that \"hewlett-Packard's effort to eradicate discrimination against homosexuals in its workplace were entirely consistent with the goals and objective of our civil rights statutes generall\". See, e.g. Nichols v.Azteca Restaurant, 256 F.3d 864, 870 (9th Cir. 2001) (gender stereotyping violates Title VII); Rene v. MGM Grand Hotel, 305 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc) (Title VII forbids same-sex harassment). The Court also held that \"we will assume arguendo that Peterson could establish a prima facie case that his posting of the anti-gay scriptural passages stemmed from his religious beliefs that homosexual activities &#8220;violate the commandments of God contained in the Holy Bible&#8221; and that those same religious beliefs imposed upon him &#8220;a duty to expose evil when confronted with sin.&#8221; We make that assumption with considerable reservations, however, because we seriously doubt that the doctrines to which Peterson professes allegiance compel any employee to engage in either expressive or physical activity designed to hurt or harass one&#8217;s fellow employees\". Therefore \"an employer need not accommodate an employee&#8217;s religious beliefs if doing so would result in discrimination against his co-workers or deprive them of contractual or other statutory rights. See Hardison, 432 U.S. at 81; Opuku-Boateng v. California, 95 F.3d 1461, 1468 (9th Cir. 1996). Nor does Title VII require an employer to accommodate an employee&#8217;s desire to impose his religious beliefs upon his co-workers. Chalmers, 101 F.3d at 1021; Wilson v. U.S. West Communications, 58 F.3d 1337, 1342 (8th Cir. 1995).",
