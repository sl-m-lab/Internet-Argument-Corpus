The wafer people have gotten this one repealed.\n \n As in most dairy states, Vermont does what it can to discourage the use of margarine. For example, it's illegal to use colored margarine in restaurants unless the menu indicates you do--in letters two inches high. Colored margarine can only be served in triangle shaped patties.\n \n Georgia has 75 laws on how to build rice paddies, even though the state has only one rice farm left. Rice was the state's No. 1 crop before the Civil War. But right after the war, a hurricane destroyed all the paddies and ponds. It was too expensive to replace them without slaves, so the Rice State began growing peaches, peanuts and other crops.\n \n It used to be against the law to go to the theater in Gary, Ind., after eating garlic.\n \n An old law in Waterloo, Neb., discouraged barbers from eating onions on the job.\n \n You may deserve a break today, but you won't get it in Bloomfield, Conn., if you can't wait to get home from your local fast food emporium: It's against the law to eat in your car.\n \n It's illegal to carry an ice cream cone in your pocket in Lexington, KY.\n \n Tomatoes are actually a fruit, but legally speaking, they're a vegetable. Ruling in an 1893 tariff case, the U.S. Supreme Court said that because tomatoes are normally eaten during a meal and not afterward, they are legally vegetables.\n \n One of the early Occupational Safety and Health Act laws in effect prohibited the use of ice in drinking water. It's been repealed.\n \n The Iowa Legislature once passed a resolution ordering the state cafeteria to start serving cornbread.\n \n In Wisconsin you need a cheesemaker's license to make any kind of cheese, except Limburger. To make Limburger, you need a master cheesemaker's license.\n \n Many states have had whacky liquor regulations. In Nevada until the 1960s it was illegal to sell liquor at religious camp meetings, within a half-mile of the state prison, in the State Capitol Building or to imbeciles.\n \n Also, saloonkeepers had to post the names of habitual drunkards if so requested by the local sheriff or members of the imbibers' immediate families.\n \n California only fairly recently legalized the sale of alcoholic beverages in nudist colonies.\n \n Minnesota has repealed its so-called \"Twinkie\" law, under which a Minneapolis City Council candidate was indicted for dispensing $34 worth of Twinkies, Ho-Hos, cookies, Kool-Aid and coffee to some senior citizens.\n \n Montana just legalized the production of caviar.\n \n In New York City you need a permit to transport carbonated beverages.\n \n New York and a handful of other states require that toilets be evenly divided among men and women in public theaters or arenas.\n \n The Santa Monica, Calif., City Council recently proposed that men be allowed to use women's public restrooms when there's a line of three or more at the mens' room, and vice versa.\n \n It's illegal in Florida for an unmarried man and woman to live together in \"open and gross lewdness.\" Connecticut once had a similar law, but only the woman was penalized.\n \n You need a license to sell condoms in Washington state.\n \n In the old days in Nevada a man caught beating his wife was tied to a stake for eight hours a day with a sign that read, \"Wife Beater\" fastened to his chest.\n \n In South Carolina, wife beaters weren't allowed to hold public office.\n \n An ordinance in Linden, Ala., provided that all women of \"uncertain chastity\" had to be off the streets by 9 p.m.\n \n Vietnam veterans may remember that a Vietnamese lawmaker proposed the country should ban the practice of women wearing \"falsies.\"\n \n A Wisconsin legislator in the 1970s proposed a law providing that no woman over 21 be required to divulge her age. If age information were required by law, women could use an alphabetic code: women in their '20s would use A, women in their '30s B, and so on.\n \n A Maryland law outlaws \"female sitters, also known as shills,\" women paid by owners to sit in their bars and encourage male patrons to buy drinks.\n \n In Missouri, male legislators once introduced a resolution urging their female colleagues to strap snub-nosed, 38-caliber revolvers to their ankles.\n \n In Hawaii a husband or wife who deserted a spouse and failed to reconcile could be given a month of hard labor. Second offense was a year of hard labor.\n\n \n \n Wow...\n \n Are these even true?",

   "For connoisseurs of bizarre laws, a number of weird and archaic examples have lingered into modern times here in England. \n \n For instance: It is illegal to enter the Houses of Parliament wearing a suit of armour. Until 1976 cab drivers were required by law to carry a bale of hay to feed horses. Passengers getting into a taxi are still supposed to be asked (by the driver) whether they are suffering from smallpox or the bubonic plague.\n \n A law introduced in 1307, and never repealed, prescribes that the head of any dead whale found on the British coast becomes the property of the king. The tail belongs to the queen in case she should need whalebone for her corsets. emoticon_wow \n \n James.",

   "Did you know it is illegal to eat mince pies on Xmas Day in England? Originally, they were shaped like the manger. Oliver Cromwell hated Christmas (essentially a pagan holiday) and banned them. To my knowledge this has not been repealed.\n \n In fact Cromwell's influence spread across to British colonies in America. In Boston, Christmas was banned from 1659 to 1681. You could be fined for celebrating it.",

   "While the lawmaking process may leave something to be desired, I think this is not the case here.\n \n I think all these eexamples are not exactly laws, but rather elements from judgements passed. For example, the streetcar exampe may not really mean garlic eating ordinances exist, however, if a case of someone stinking badly of gralic being kicked off a streetcar because the stench bothered other passengers, the court might rule that his conduct was not acceple, equating the smell to a breach of peace or something.\n \n A known example would be that the law says that an XXX is a horse, but wheat grain is not wheat grain (a known example). The situation applies to ceses where the court had to decide whether a contract has not been fulfilled at all or just fullfilled in an unsatisfactory fashion. In the first case, a horse was leased to perform some work, and when the contractor only provided an XXX, the work could still be performed, meaning the other contractor was only entitled to some compensation due to the asses lower strenght. In the second case, however, grain was purchased for the purpose of being sown, and as the delivered grain was sterilyzed and thus dead, it could not perform the desired task at all.",

   "If you want a freaky and indeed undefined law consider the 1986 Federal Drug Analog law. It states in essese that if one sells a substance with a \"substantially similar structure\" to a drug on the DEA lists AND that substance has any effects similar to substances on the DEA list then you are subject to the same penalties as if you had sold/possessed the drug on the list.\n \n The term \"substantially similar structure\" has not ever been defined in any objective way, and the magnitude of the \"effect\" has never been considered in objective terms. Basically its a law designed to trap what they wish to trap regardless of the scientific situation. In one instance it was claimed that a material consisting of wheat flour, butter, salt, caffine, and egg yolk was a drug analog which was a stimulatnt and thus subject to prosecution as if the material was cocaine. Fortunately on appeal up the line the appeals court tossed it out.",
