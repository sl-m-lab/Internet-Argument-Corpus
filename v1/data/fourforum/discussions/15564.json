   "Buried in the Standard & Poor downgrade of our nation's credit worthiness is S&P's focusing on TeaParty brinkmanship, extreme partisanship, pig-headed inability to compromise and a dogged refusal to raise the required revenues to bring about balance:\n \nThe political brinksmanship of recent months highlights what we see as America's governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable than what we previously believed. The statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy. Despite this year's wide-ranging debate, in our view, the differences between political parties have proven to be extraordinarily difficult to bridge, and, as we see it, the resulting agreement fell well short of the comprehensive fiscal consolidation program that some proponents had envisaged until quite recently. Republicans and Democrats have only been able to agree to relatively modest savings on discretionary spending while delegating to the Select Committee decisions on more comprehensive measures. It appears that for now, new revenues have dropped down on the menu of policy options....\n \n Compared with previous projections, our revised base case scenario now\n assumes that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, due to expire by the end of 2012,\n remain in place. We have changed our assumption on this because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues, a position we believe Congress reinforced by passing the act....\nhttp://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3DUS_Downgraded_AA%2B.pdf&blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&blobkey=id&blobheadername1=content-type&blobwhere=1243942957443&blobheadervalue3=UTF-8",

You see you and those who think like you bear a large portion of the blame. I don't mean conservative or liberal or Democrat or Republican by that either. I mean people who tolerate incomptenece from one side while actively seeking from the other. Your loyalty to conservatives and now The Tea Party is based more on your belief of what they stand for than what their actions show they stand for. \n \n Republicans and The Tea Party from his electrion have openly stated they want him to be a one term President. Anything that has passed coming from Democrats has been a fight. I can't recall seeing our government and population so divided. The Republicans are willing to crash the nation to gain control and for what? To implement plans that have only been moderatly succesful and only for short periods of time. \n \n What good is cutting corporate taxes if there is no incentive to put that money back into the economy domestically?

It doesn't flow down to a middle or lower class as is theorized.\n \n If you want to save Medicare a good start would be negotiating price for perscription drugs. \n \n Take some responsibility for the problems we have. Nobody had an issue raising the debt ceiling the last hundred years, but now not a penny more.\n \n We can not simply reduce spending to get out of debt. Tax increases (Freedom cringes and yells nasty words at his monitor) will be necessary, but they can be distrubuted more evenly than is being proposed\n \n Democrats need to grasp the concept that much of what they feel is necessary really isn't even when the economy is good.\n \n It isn't the rich that put us in this situation and it isn't the rich who will get us out. \n \n The Tea Party are like a bull in a china factory. If nothing is left after their done who cares what they accomplished. \n \n Help Social Security by increasing incentives to save for retirement thus reducing the need for it.\n \n As I recall Republicans were given a mandate by the American people to create jobs and fix the economy. Fix the first you will fix the second.\n \n Both sides should be fired just about every single one of them. My only fear is the next crew would most likely be no better.\n \n Until they put aside their BS they will not pay the consequences we will. \n \n So keep sewing forth your conservative Republicans are always right and only they can save the country nonsense, they have failed just as miserably as Democrats, but if you keep trying to shift responsibility in the wrong direction what do you think is going to change?

   "Your loyalty to conservatives and now The Tea Party is based more on your belief of what they stand for than what their actions show they stand for.\n \n You speak as if anything but principles should evoke loyalty. If zorba believes as I do that the chances of anyone with a collectivist philosophy has no chance of making the right choice of course we will choose an alternative, no matter how small the chance that they will make the right choice because it is still greater than zero.\n \n I will elect a bible quoting, gun carrying, confederate sympathizing, crude, stupid, and scandalous candidate that shows even the slightest indication of understanding the need to defend liberty over an intelligent, witty, well spoken, well educated, far-seeing, charismatic candidate that gives any indication that he believes in sacrificing liberty.\n \n If all the caricatures from the left are the believed that choice is put to me every election and I have done as I claimed I would.\n \n What intelligence and ability obama may have is a con, because his goals are wrong. Just as Limbaugh said, I want him to fail.\n \n Contrary to what the left has said about the right, no threat of theocracy or fascism has ever manifested even in the slightest. The greatest blame I can place on the right in general is that they are clueless as to where their values come from and that they come close to worshiping this nations ethos just because it's older than they are.\n \n But exactly as the right has warned the left has consistently sacrificed individual liberty for socialization and waste.\n \n I have yet to see one significant attack on the rights of man from the right since Vietnam.\n \n Homosexuals complain that they are repressed but the right has not proposed laws against homosexual sex, they are fighting over a definition.\n \n Some mad posters have claimed that rightist raise taxes just as much as leftist, but you know that is in general a lie, and when and where it is not is why the tea party distinguishes itself from the republican party.\n \n In general they do not waste money, they do not form extraneous government organizations, they do not regulate, do not nationalize. In short, in general they do as they say they will, and the same is true of the left.\n \n So what is it that they really stand for? No papillon, I am afraid the answer is not as convenient as the idea that pretenders and posers polarize the countries politics, we are not one big happy family after the same things. The people vote for people whom they agree with and for the most part those people do what they said they would. The conflict is real.\n \n It is a difficult thing to accept for a people who were raised on the brilliance of republican democracy as Americans are.\n \n The teabaggers are doing what they promised, bringing to light their stubbornness to raise the debt limit or cooperate with leftist plans for recovery is like showing a five star french buffet in a commercial to end world hunger.\n It's what we want them to be doing.\n \n \nRepublicans and The Tea Party from his electrion have openly stated they want him to be a one term President.\n\n I wanted him to be a zero term president.\n \n \nAnything that has passed coming from Democrats has been a fight. \n\n Of course, and vice versa. This is because these two in general disagree on a philosophical level and a billion debaters could not in a million years agree on policy when they do not agree on the goal.\n \n \nI can't recall seeing our government and population so divided.\n\n I can find a time that was even more divided in history books. The civil war. The greatest lesson I took from the civil war was not the war itself, but all the compromises and appeasement from both sides before the war; each serving only to prolong the festering evil that was slavery. Each based on the same hope that you seem to have that despite every evidence no fundamental disagreement exists.\n \n \nThe Republicans are willing to crash the nation to gain control and for what?\n\n Republicans say the exact same thing about democrats, and it's silly then too.\n \n Both sides are following different philosophies. Neither sees themselves as the crasher but the savior.\n \n You ask for what? To save the nation, by crashing the democrats plans. Just as the democrats fight with all their ability republican initiatives, not because they want to sieze power but because they think it's the right thing to do.\n \n \nTo implement plans that have only been moderatly succesful and only for short periods of time. \n\n To what end? Their goal is primarily to undo everything that obama and his predecessors have done. This is not a plan proper, but an anti-plan.\n \n \nWhat good is cutting corporate taxes if there is no incentive to put that money back into the economy domestically?\n\n It's a step towards more perfect morality.\n \n \nIf current laws encourage taking money offshore guess where that savings is going to go?\n\n Then destroy those laws that encourage this, they almost certainly are not justified anyway.\n \n \nThe wealthiest people if given more money have shown what they will do with it.\n\n Then give them no more than you have a right to take, which is nothing.\n \n \nThey keep it. It doesn't flow down to a middle or lower class as is theorized.\n\n Whoever has told you that 'the theory' is that money will flow from the rich to the middle or poor is either a fool or a liar.\n \n The wealth does flow but those flows sum to positives in the end, the theory predicts no net change but growth, certainly not a change in ratios.\n \n Capitalism is not a system of distribution even if some describe it in such terms to compare it to the marxist family of political economies. In capitalism a trader (note the omission of consumer vs producer distinction, they are both members of the trader class) is like a catalyst which fuels the general production of other traders in the system. A catalyst is not consumed (the wealth removed). No one (sane) expects the rich to get less rich, they expect everyone to get more rich and there is where what data is applicable agrees with theory.\n \n We have discussed the need for significant investment, this is how 'rich' entities support and accelerate the production of all. If they do not invest, it is the loss of a potential benefit not a true detriment. Even when they invest it is not 'flowing to the middle classes'. All 'classes' are responsible for their own wealth, a handout is literally charity.\n \n \nIf you want to save Medicare a good start would be negotiating price for perscription drugs. \n\n I don't.\n \n \nTake some responsibility for the problems we have. Nobody had an issue raising the debt ceiling the last hundred years, but now not a penny more.\n\n The problems we have is that people are trying to raise the debt ceiling to borrow money to pay of loans. This is exactly how individuals destroy their credit as well BTW.\n \n \nWe can not simply reduce spending to get out of debt. Tax increases \n\n I will tell you how to get out of debt, we aren't in debt. I never agreed to pay for any stimulus or what not and I doubt you did either. The united states government has defrauded it's lenders, and let the citizen who would claim responsibility for the mad spending pay for it.\n \n \n(Freedom cringes and yells nasty words at his monitor)\n\n Indeed.\n \n \nHelp Social Security by increasing incentives to save for retirement thus reducing the need for it.\n\n No! No incentives, no schemes or plans of any kind.\n \n \nAs I recall Republicans were given a mandate by the American people to create jobs and fix the economy. Fix the first you \n will fix the second.\n\n The white house says that the government doesn't create jobs.\n \n \nSo keep sewing forth your conservative Republicans are always right and only they can save the country nonsense, they have failed just as miserably as Democrats, but if you keep trying to shift responsibility in the wrong direction what do you think is going to change? Nothing\n\n They may fail at saving the country, but what tea partiers really claim is that they would also fail where the democrats succeeded... at damning the country.\n \n You cannot light a fire and then claim that everyone else in the room is equally responsible just because they will be burned as well, and they have no better fire extinguisher than you.",

   "Once again you show your ignorance of reality. Obama hasn't been able to enact any Policies of his own we are still under mostly the Policies put in place by Bush,., you know the FAILED policies that drove this nation into the ditch.\n\n \n WOW; you're either completely stupid or a blatant liar to say such a thing. This militant environmentalist whack job of a president is regulating us into economic oblivion and you say he hasn't been able to enact any of his policies? \n \n Check out this link: Obama's EPA Regulations Destroying Economy & Depriving Citizens of Necessities The perpetual view's Blog\n \n From the LINK: Obama's EPA Regulations based on Agenda 21 and Sustainable Development are destroying businesses and depriving citizens of necessities across the nation. Unfortunately the Debt Ceiling debate was providing cover while some of these regulations were being implemented. Below is a letter to the editor I wrote that was published August 3 in the Democrat Gazette (but with key elements of the letter I sent in omitted) that is typical of numerous regulations. It is not enough that our government is taking a major food staple, corn, and converting it into an alternate fuel , and exploiting us with skyrocketing electricity prices - both of which increase the price of groceries exponentially; but now they are going to starve us through directly regulating agriculture.\n \n Two headlines recently caught my attention: \"Hundreds endure heat for help in paying electricity bills\" and \"EPA tells coal-fired plants: Reduce pollution or shut down.\" While thousands across the nation are suffering triple digit degree weather, many with utility bills already shut off; Obama is busy increasing the price of electricity.\n \n American Electric Company in Ohio reported: \"Because of the unrealistic compliance timelines in the EPA proposals, we will have to prematurely shut down nearly 25 percent of our current coal-fueled generating capacity cut hundreds of good power plant jobs [600 with annual wages totaling approximately $40 million], and invest billions of dollars [$6 to $8 billion] in capital to retire, retrofit and replace coal-fueled power plants...said Michael G. Morris, AEP chairman.\"\n \n Remember \"Obama\" said, \"Under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.\" Obama is governing by the motto \"Never waste a crisis.\" Higher electricity prices are a hidden tax that promote Obama's plan of redistribution of wealth since some of us will pay for our own higher electricity bills while also paying taxes to pay for those who can't afford them.\n \n \n S&P downgraded us because the Teabaggers don't understand economics and the fact that Revenues are going to have to be raised before we will ever gain stability in this economy. We're not totally out of the recession and the Teabaggers think that Cutting billions of dollars out of our economy will help us get back on track. \n\n \n I marvel at how you infer I am ignorant when you sound absolutely stupid in claiming the Tea Party holds any responsibility at all for this economic debacle we find ourselves in. All the Tea Party has ever asked this administration for is fiscal restraint and you seem to be implying that demanding that this administration actually act responsibly has caused this credit downgrade. You prove just how irrational and delusional you are as a lunatic leftist to blame a citizens group for the actions of an administration that controls the Whitehouse. It boggles the mind that you can even assert such foolishness.\n \n \n They are wrong. Obama has his hands tied by Ideological Neo Conservatives who's only agenda is to get him out of office. They don't even understand what the debt ceiling is about. Congress is responsible for spending, not the President, so if they want to lay blame on over spending they should look in the mirror. They racked up this debt and just like always try to place all the blame on the Democrat.. It's pathetic.\n\n \n Obviously its you who doesn't understand what the debt ceiling is since it's the President who either signs or vetoes the spending bills submitted to him by Congress. If he really wanted to practice fiscal restraint all he had to do was veto what Congress sent him, a democratic congress in the last session, mind you. But noooooooo, between him and the two houses during the last session they pushed through spending bills worth many hundreds of billions of dollars in the middle of the night and never even sought the input from the republican minority.\n \n They spent like drunken fools to the tune of spending millions of dollars to produce each job that bolstered the public sector rather than create jobs in the private sector where the economy lives and breathes. Everything this president has done has given us a massively bloated government which just places more strain on the tax payer to support an obese government that consumes our resources rather than creates an atmosphere for creating jobs and growing the economy.",

   "Here's more: Obama is anti-business, Forbes and Zuckerman say - CNN Political Ticker - CNN.com Blogs\n \n Now, try educating yourself before dishonestly blaming a citizens group for the anti business and big government tax and spend policies of this socialist wannabe dictator. And notice the source is CNN, not FOX... \n Washington (CNN) - Just days after President Obama signed landmark legislation increasing oversight of Wall Street, he is again being slammed for being anti-business.\n Asked about recent perceptions among business leaders that Obama is not in their corner, Steve Forbes, chairman and CEO of Forbes, Inc., agreed with that assessment.\n \n Related video: Forbes, Zuckerman on the economy, Obama, the business community\n \"Well, the president clearly is [anti-business],\" Forbes, a former Republican presidential hopeful, said in an interview that aired Sunday on CNN's State of the Union. \"I mean you can take excesses [of some on Wall Street] and tar the whole business community, which is like taking election fraud and saying that's why we shouldn't have free elections. He caricatures them, and you saw it in that letter that his top aides sent to the Business Roundtable saying our doors are open even to the business community.\"\n Forbes told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley that the Obama administration would do well to heed some of the business community's concerns.\n \n \"The business community employs 110 million people; companies and the people who work with them pay most of the taxes in this country. That's where the innovation comes from,\" he said.\n \"So whenever business talks about the need for a stable currency, about the need for a better tax code, they always say, oh, well they're always whining, that's what they always want as if there's some dog that keeps barking or baby crying on an airplane instead of dealing with the substance of the thing. And that is: when you have a tax environment where you don't punish success, where you don't trample on the rule of laws - as they did with Chrysler and other situations - where you can trust the currency, where you're not going to have massive, thousands of new rules come and hit you, and you have no idea what they're going to be, they don't take that stuff seriously. They just think they're a bunch of greedy crybabies, and the business community is reacting to that.\"\n Mort Zuckerman, a prominent supporter of Obama's campaign and the editor-in-chief of U.S. News & World Report, told Crowley that he believes Obama's rhetoric when it comes to the business community runs counter to the kind of confidence the economy needs right now to turn itself around.\n \"I'm not saying that Washington hasn't tried to do some good things,\" Zuckerman told Crowley. \"They've also done some things that I think are really, really very, very counter to trying to get this economy growing.\n \"One of them is not only regulation, but expensive regulation. The other is - and they've done something here that affects everybody's confidence in the attitudes of this administration to the business community and to the economy - they've demonized the business world; they've blamed everything on the business world. Frankly, I don't think that's accurate, but more than that, it's counterproductive to what this administration wants, which is a much more optimistic and confident business community.\"\n As passage of the Wall Street reform bill seemed imminent, the White House began battling the perception that it is anti-business. The top Republican in the House recently called for a moratorium on new federal regulations as a way to provide more certainty to businesses and the Chamber of Commerce, one of the key national voices on behalf of business interests, slammed the White House for not doing enough to create jobs. In a letter posted on its website, the chamber said the Obama administration \"vilified industries while embarking on an ill-advised course of government expansion, major tax increases, massive deficits and job-destroying regulations.\"\n ",

Remember we are still in the midst of Two wars that were Unfunded. Bush gutted the Revenues before we entered into those wars and we had to borrow the money to fund them. we're currently spending roughly 2 billion dollars a day in Afghanistan, and that's money that has to be borrowed because we don't have the revenues to pay for it. The Department of Homeland security could be completely eliminated, we don't need it. The Tea Party is so adamant against raising taxes on billionaires that they are willing to cut everything under the sun and drive the country off a cliff . The worst part is that we don't even have to raise taxes to raise the needed revenues. All they need to do is reform the tax code and close all the loopholes that bleed revenues to the super wealthy corporations. Cut off the Subsidies that are being paid to billion dollar companies and they could raise billions in revenues. Eliminate the Cap on the FICA tax and they could raise revenues by billions. But the Tea Party sticks their head in the sand and signs a pledge that they will see the country default before they allow ANY taxes. \n \n It has been claimed that Ronald Reagan's 1981 cuts caused the 1980s economic boom. In fact, that boom followed Reagan's 1982 tax increase. The 1990s boom likewise was not the result of a tax cut; it came in the wake of Bill Clinton's 1993 tax increase.\n \n Presidents of the past like Reagan cut taxes, but he also ran huge deficits. it was only after he raised taxes that the economy strengthened. It was Tax increases that helped Clinton balance the budget, that and the Social Security Surplus. \n \n The plain fact is that the Tea Party is not about re-building America to it's former Glory. It's about Building an America that resembles their own radical view of what America should be. Look at what's going on now in the Republican primaries Zoo of idiocy. Listen to Romney speak and he is not presenting Ideas on how he would fix things. Michelle Bachman is not telling us how she would fix the economy as President. Ron Paul is Living 200 years in the past and believes everything to be unconstitutional ,, yet I don't hear his Ideas on how to fix things.. No.. these people are all about \" Let's make Obama a one term President\".. and they could care less about the Middle Class working Americans that Built this country.",

The Tea Party is all about holding this socialists feet to the fire and demanding that he does the right thing for the people he was elected to serve. It isn't his job to fundamentally reshape America in his socialist image, it's his job to protect the capitalist model that has worked so well for us for these past centuries. That model that has made us the richest, freest and most prosperous nation on earth in the shortest amount of time.\n \n \nThe only thing that Obama has been able to pass is Health Care.. and it's working so what have you proven.. Nothing.\n\n \n You're as stupid as you are delusional. Here; educate yourself: Obamacare failure now evident as health care costs rise nationwide\n \n Here's an excerpt for you:\n (NaturalNews) President Barack Obama's signature health care law was supposed to accomplish a couple of things. First, it was supposed to ensure that all Americans had access to quality healthcare; and second, it was supposed to reduce overall healthcare expenditures.\n \n In a word, the law - while admittedly not yet fully implemented - has not led to either goal, and in fact, costs overall are skyrocketing.\n \n These claims were substantiated in a recent subcommittee hearing of the House Education and Workforce Committee. Brett Parker, a finance officer for a small business in New York City, in testimony before the subcommittee, said the law hasn't \"locked in costs, and instead increased them, while loading job creators with mandates, regulations, new taxes and burdens.\"\n \n \"Rather than solve the problems in the health care system, [the law] ignores costs and instead redistributes money from producers in order to fund vast new entitlements and expand old ones - this was not an improvement over the status quo, it was a step backwards,\" Parker told lawmakers.\n \n Costs for health insurance, medical services, medicines - all of it - continue to rise, despite the massive piece of legislation that is \"Obamacare.\" And, as they do, all Washington can do is argue over why.\n \n But maybe rising costs shouldn't surprise us. After all, there were a few models on which to base portions of Obamacare before the latter was unfairly put upon Americans more than a year ago.\n \n In Massachusetts, under former governor and prospective GOP presidential contender Mitt Romney, a healthcare measure was passed that included an individual mandate (under threat of penalty) and other provisions similar to Obamacare. The law was supposed to accomplish the twin goals of ensuring all state residents and lowering health insurance and actual costs. \"Every uninsured citizen in Massachusetts will soon have affordable health insurance and the costs of health care will be reduced,\" Romney wrote in The Wall Street Journal. Neither goal reached fruition.\n \n In fact, current Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and current state lawmakers are still dealing with rising healthcare costs. But didn't \"RomneyCare\" solve those problems?\n \n About as well as Obamacare has solved the nation's healthcare delivery and cost problems.\n \n Learn more: Obamacare failure now evident as health care costs rise nationwide \n \nLook The Tea Party Congress Agreed to and passed a budget back in April of this year, you remember, the first hostage situation where they forced their view on the American people by passing THEIR budget. Raising the Debt Ceiling was about PAYING for the money they had already spent.. not about spending more. They are directly to blame for this current situation.. if they had taken the 4 trillion dollar deal Obama offered up front they might have actually helped the situation, but they are so fearful of raising taxes on billionaires that they can't see through the stupidity long enough to actually pass something that will help.\n\n \n What is it about you leftist progressives that allows you to completely ignore reality and rewrite history mere months after witnessing it first hand, in real time? How can people like you either be so incredibly dishonest or stupid as to misinterpret the truth so massively? And what's more; dare to speak publicly of your dishonest reading of current events.

Pushing your Conservative Christian Agenda using a fake political party and calling yourself a Patriot is so far beyond delusion there is no way back to reality for you. I didn't see you people complaining when the Re-pugs went on a spending spree.. \n \n The FACT is just like I said above. This Congress passed a Budget after holding The Nation hostage back in April. \n \n Here's a little history to help you remember the truth....\n \n President Barack Obama proposed his 2011 budget during February 2010 Which did not pass the House. The Tea Party and GOP blocked it and then claimed Obama has failed to pass a budget plan. ..\n \n The Tea Party / GOP refused to pass the Budget proposed by the President and negotiations began . In April of 2011 the Country was faced with a shut down of Government and a deal was struck and the House passed a budget deal containing $38.5 billion in cuts from 2010 funding levels was reached with just hours remaining before the deadline. The 2011 budget was enacted on April 15, 2011. \n \n They passed it, they spent it.. and then this past month they refused to PAY for it by holding the debt Ceiling hostage, which in turn led to the first downgrade in U.S. history. \n \n And let's not forget that On February 14, 2011, President Obama released his 2012 Federal Budget. They won't pass this one either because they once again have to claim that Obama is doing nothing. \n \n In all this I have yet to see a legitimate budget proposal by anyone on the GOP / Teabagger side .. so who is really concerned about \" The Economy\"..",

Personally I think this is a waste of money but that's another debate.\n\n \n I think as far as Social security is concerned the blame should be laid on both parties for the way the program has been structured. Forcing the Government to Borrow surplus money by issuing T-bills basically set them up to fail . The only reason the program is a problem now is because of the debt incurred by borrowing from the surplus that the government is forced to repay by borrowing more from elsewhere. they should have allowed the investment of surpluses in other areas to further increase the surplus. They should take the piggy bank away from the Government and let the program sustain itself through revenues. \n \n I used the 2000 mark because it was the first date that came to mind, I wasn't sure exactly what year Obama reduced the Tax to 4%. And Capping Benefits IMO would be a good thing. The Program was designed to keep people from falling into Poverty, not setting them up like Kings. A Benefit cap based on cost of living for current year would be good. \n \n \n \n I haven't seen a real plan from Republicans that eliminates Medicare.

They should also allow Medicare to negotiate with doctors and pharmaceutical companies for cheaper drugs and cheaper care. The VA does, and they are able to basically give away Medications for little or no cost to veterans. Medicare on the other hand doesn't do this so their costs are compounded. \n \n \n\n You begin to run into a problem here. Taxes have tended to hit a wall at 18% of GDP over the last 60 years.

Not only did S&P cite the unwillingness of the tea party to consider tax increases (revenue increases), their big beef was the obstructionism and irrationality of the process. The tea party, and by extension the GOP, owns that.\n \n Personally, I dont think that they should have raised the debt limit. I think that the work that went into crafting that nonsense plan they came up with should have gone into figuring out how to restructure without defaulting on our debt. OR, even a plan for how to restructure in the wake of a debt default would have been OK with me. \n \n We did not get that. Instead we basically had one side bringing us to the brink of default with NO tools or strategy on the table to deal with it. IF they could not do that...take at least basic steps....hold the discussion about how to deal with a default and the restructuring after, then they should have passed a CLEAN debt limit increase. \n \n What the republicans and the tea party did was push their ideological goals by holding a gun to the head of every American and that is absolutely inexcusable. \n \n This was especially true with their \"cut, cap, and balance\" plan. In holding america hostage unless that CC&B plan passed, they were tinkering with the constitution under duress. They were essentially saying \"pass this constitutional amendment or we will destroy the entire nation\". They may as well have threatened us with a nuke. All those pricks should be tried for treason and executed. \n \n That said, I fully support cutting most government programs. I fully support the idea of a balanced budget amendment...but NOT the one that they were trying to force passage on. And I am fully OPPOSED to anybody trying to force passage of a constitutional amendment through coercion. As far as the \"cap\" part goes, that part is stupid and ties future Americans hands. As long as there is a strong balanced budget amendment in place, there is no need for any kind of cap. Let voters and their representatives decide how much they can spend...so long as they also figure out how to pay for it. \n \n If Americans want a balanced budget amendment, the tea party and the republicans should have no problem passing it without holding a gun to our head. They could have passed it pretty much any time while Bush was in office...they had the numbers in congress to do it, they were just not interested when it was THEIR record deficits that it would reign in. Their whole balanced budget amendment demand is nothing more than a childish game.",

Failure to pass the debt ceiling increase without a plan in place to deal with our outstanding debt would have resulted in default. We would have seen hyperinflation, massive job losses, starvation. \n \n I realize you have a completely illogical idea of how the world should work that nobody but you can actually understand.

   "You speak as if anything but principles should evoke loyalty.\n \n \n Not at the cost of common sense or making a bad situation worse\n \n \nIf zorba believes as I do that the chances of anyone with a collectivist philosophy has no chance of making the right choice of course we will choose an alternative, no matter how small the chance that they will make the right choice because it is still greater than zero.\n\n \n That isn't the problem. Its doing so blindly and permitting that slim chance to wreak havoc while crossing your fingers.\n \n \n \nI will elect a bible quoting, gun carrying, confederate sympathizing, crude, stupid, and scandalous candidate that shows even the slightest indication of understanding the need to defend liberty over an intelligent, witty, well spoken, well educated, far-seeing, charismatic candidate that gives any indication that he believes in sacrificing liberty\n.\n \n I will as well if he can also show he has an understanding of the issues and a solution that doesn't create more problems than it fixes. Is that really to much to ask for?\n \n \nIf all the caricatures from the left are the believed that choice is put to me every election and I have done as I claimed I would.\n\n \n If you believe all the everything the left says I have a really splendid bridge for sale, cheap, interested?\n \n \n \nWhat intelligence and ability obama may have is a con, because his goals are wrong.\n\n \n Some are nuetral, some are differences of opinion on how to fix a problem and some are misguided. I would say the same about Bush. \n \n \nJust as Limbaugh said, I want him to fail.\n\n \n We have a system for you to voice your disagreement, its called voting. It's about as fair as we can mange. What we are experincing is a slow degradation of that system. It's becoming less about finding common beliefs that can build a working environment that benefits a majority of people who hold different principals and values. Its becoming ok to sacrifice values for principals, that one particular view must dominate.\n \n \nContrary to what the left has said about the right, no threat of theocracy or fascism has ever manifested even in the slightest.\n \n \n Theocracy was closer then you imply and if you listen to the Right we are a heartbeat away from Socialism or Marxism in preperation for communism. Which only supports my point. Why is so much effort and money spent on pushing the Left are all socialists? It's part of an agenda to discredit the opposition. It is now the norm to say vote for me because he is bad. It used to be vote for me because I am good\n \n \n \nThe greatest blame I can place on the right in general is that they are clueless as to where their values come from and that they come close to worshiping this nations ethos just because it's older than they are.\n\n \n Your smarter than that.\n \n \n \nBut exactly as the right has warned the left has consistently sacrificed individual liberty for socialization and waste.\n\n \n \n The Left tend to want to make everybody warm and fuzzy and has a fair amount of bark eating vegans that like to make themselves feel good by creating social programs. The Right just lies. They say one thing and then do something completly different. They don't shrink government, but they say that is what they will do. They say they want to help people thrive and be successful, but pass legislation that encourages the opposite.\n \n Republicans and Big Government - James Ostrowski - Mises Daily\n \n The Heretic's Corner: 5 Republican Myths\n \n \n \nI have yet to see one significant attack on the rights of man from the right since Vietnam.\n\n \n \n The Patriot Act\n Numerous Voter laws\n Punishment For states that pass laws the Fed doesn't like. (Medical Marajuna, Gay marriage)\n Attacks on Unions\n \n \nHomosexuals complain that they are repressed but the right has not proposed laws against homosexual sex, they are fighting over a definition.\n\n \n If a state passes a law that recognizes it what is the basis of the Fed not?\n \n \nSome mad posters have claimed that rightist raise taxes just as much as leftist, but you know that is in general a lie,\n\n \n You may be very disappointed, but this is also a quantity vs qaulity issue\n \n \nand when and where it is not is why the tea party distinguishes itself from the republican party.\n\n \n Well I guess that makes up for the last 100 years. The Tea Party is to new to have a record. I expect they would claim they are for a lot of things only time will tell.\n \n \nIn general they do not waste money\n, \n \n Yes they do\n Spending Statistics: Republicans vs. Democrats Atypical Guy\n \n \nthey do not form extraneous government organizations\n,\n \n Afraid they do\n \n \nthey do not regulate\n,\n \n Are you nuts? They don't want to regulate business, people they are all over like white on rice.\n \n \ndo not nationalize.\n \n \n That is true. If they had their way they would deport 25% of the legal population\n \n \nIn short, in general they do as they say they will, and the same is true of the left.\n\n \n I am going to disagree with you on this one\n \n \nSo what is it that they really stand for? No papillon, I am afraid the answer is not as convenient as the idea that pretenders and posers polarize the countries politics, we are not one big happy family after the same things. The people vote for people whom they agree with and for the most part those people do what they said they would. The conflict is real.\n\n \n No we are not one big happy family, we are more like roommates. We have our own lives, different interests, different goals, but at the end of the day we share the same roof. \n \n Voter turnout averages about 50% for presidential elections and about 40% for mid terms. Why do we have find something to agree on with the representitive. His or her job is not to vote his conscience or his principals or his values. They are there to represent the people or the states. You want something immoral about government this is a good one. How is the opinion of one person supposed to reflect that of 1 5 15 million people in a state? Our system operates under the idea that the people will settle for whoever is closest to something that is important to them. No wonder people think their vote doesn't count, it doesn't. The person sent to Washington his vote is what counts. So if your a liberal firmly against abortion or conservative who is ok with gay marriage your stuck having to abondon one belief for another and hope your representitive doesn't make a deal and vote against the thing you voted him in for. \n \n \n \nI wanted him to be a zero term president.\n\n \n You can't always get want you want, but if you try sometimes you get what you need\n \n \n \nOf course, and vice versa. This is because these two in general disagree on a philosophical level and a billion debaters could not in a million years agree on policy when they do not agree on the goal.\n\n \n Its the unwillingness to comprimise. Our government doesn't work without it. We have three groups who want to be right and don't care about anything else. I don't expect them to agree on everything. I do expect them to figure out a way to coming pretty GD close without driving the bus over a cliff.\n \n \n \nI can find a time that was even more divided in history books. The civil war. The greatest lesson I took from the civil war was not the war itself, but all the compromises and appeasement from both sides before the war; each serving only to prolong the festering evil that was slavery. Each based on the same hope that you seem to have that despite every evidence no fundamental disagreement exists.\n\n \n I would prefer to not engage in another civil war. The problem ultimatly is we have a political system that has lost its integrity, can be to easily influenced by special interest and is sanctioned by a population uninterested or to busy to participate in government and to lazy to see who is manipulating and liying to them.\n \n \n \nYou ask for what? To save the nation, by crashing the democrats plans. Just as the democrats fight with all their ability republican initiatives, not because they want to sieze power but because they think it's the right thing to do.\n\n \n I think at best they think it is the right thing for them. When we talk about shared sacrifice or having to make tough cuts. I have to ask why I didn't spend a billion more than I should have and I am pretty sure none of my neighbors did either. I don't recall being asked about if my representitive should vote yes or no on anything. I don't see them enacting laws that penalize them for poor performance or to limit lobby groups from helping out in some way. I mean the country is on eggshells over money and the FAA is losing 30million a day and they have to go on vacation. They can deal with it later. Could they not have done the don't interrupt my vacation deal two weeks earlier?\n \n \nTo what end? Their goal is primarily to undo everything that obama and his predecessors have done. This is not a plan proper, but an anti-plan.\n\n \n \n Based on nothing but its from a Dem kill it. They don't care what the people want that isn't for the people to decide that is what they do.\n \n \n \nIt's a step towards more perfect morality.\n\n \n We are discussing what is not what could or should be. The mantra is cut taxes on business and those corps are just begging to be allowed to throw money at their employees who they will hire two for every position needed. But it never really works that way. Don't get me wrong I don't believe in punishing someone for being succesful, I just don't see the point in rewarding them for it either.\n \n \n \nThen destroy those laws that encourage this, they almost certainly are not justified anyway.\n \n \n Then give them no more than you have a right to take, which is nothing.\n\n \n \n I don't know what these are responding to.\n \n \nWhoever has told you that 'the theory' is that money will flow from the rich to the middle or poor is either a fool or a liar.\n\n \n \n Based on results I would say both, but that seems not a bit of a deterrent, because that is the principal worth fighting for in the minds of many people.\n \n \nThe wealth does flow but those flows sum to positives in the end, the theory predicts no net change but growth, certainly not a change in ratios.\n\n \n Proportional growth has not been accomplished.\n \n \nCapitalism is not a system of distribution even if some describe it in such terms to compare it to the marxist family of political economies. In capitalism a trader (note the omission of consumer vs producer distinction, they are both members of the trader class) is like a catalyst which fuels the general production of other traders in the system.\n \n \n All things are not equal\n \n \n \nA catalyst is not consumed (the wealth removed). No one (sane) expects the rich to get less rich, they expect everyone to get more rich and there is where what data is applicable agrees with theory.\n\n \n There needs to be more wealth in the system or their will be an imbalance as one becomes richer. \n \n \n \nWe have discussed the need for significant investment, this is how 'rich' entities support and accelerate the production of all. If they do not invest, it is the loss of a potential benefit not a true detriment. Even when they invest it is not 'flowing to the middle classes'. All 'classes' are responsible for their own wealth, a handout is literally charity.\n\n \n Eventually enough loss of benefit is a detriment\n \n \n \n \nThe problems we have is that people are trying to raise the debt ceiling to borrow money to pay of loans. This is exactly how individuals destroy their credit as well BTW.\n\n \n So what are your options you can't cut out all expenses, you can cut back but the interest alone is going to crush you. Raise revenue but do it with kid gloves and do it with incentives for the future. Do it smart and it will be succesful don't and it won't.\n \n \nI will tell you how to get out of debt, we aren't in debt. I never agreed to pay for any stimulus or what not and I doubt you did either. The united states government has defrauded it's lenders, and let the citizen who would claim responsibility for the mad spending pay for it.\n\n \n You just now realized our government represents its own interest based on the fanatasy that they represent the people?\n \n \nIndeed.\n\n \n I though it would be worse\n \n \nNo! No incentives, no schemes or plans of any kind.\n\n \n We deal with human nature as it is in the present we work on how we want it for the future. If you want to get rid of Social Security you have to train people to not need it.\n \n \nThe white house says that the government doesn't create jobs.\n\n \n Now what the White House says matters? Of course the government creates jobs either directly or indirectly. Where did you get this from?\n \n \nThey may fail at saving the country, but what tea partiers really claim is that they would also fail where the democrats succeeded... at damning the country.\n\n \n You are out of your mind to suggest this is completely a Democrat problem. \n \n The Tea Party are dangerous to this country, not because of what they want but because of how they want to achieve it and what they are willing to do to see it happen.\n \n \nYou cannot light a fire and then claim that everyone else in the room is equally responsible just because they will be burned as well, and they have no better fire extinguisher than you.\n\n \n Really I don't care about blame. For me blame is a means by which a problem is understood so as not to happen again. The difference between a reason and an excuse. Politicians and many people are interested in excuses and that is why we end up no better off. \n \n You cannot please all of the people all of the time, but you do have to please all of them at some time",
