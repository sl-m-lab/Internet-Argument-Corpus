   "People were giving themselves abortions since ancient times. Self-induced abortions or with help from a midwife, whom neither I'd imagine to have no medical background, would know how to carry an abortion in the safest way possible, most likely. I'd imagine educated doctors would be more of a help in performing such a task. So...\n \n People gave themselves abortions when it was not allowed, whereas this situation I'd imagine would be dangerous; considering that not only does the baby die as planned, but there's a pretty good chance that the mother has done considerable damage to herself if not killed herself as well. Wouldn't it then, make more sense to have abortion as a legal choice, since if a mother does want to perform an abortion, she'd at least have a less of a risk of dying?",

By God Himself, no less.\n \n Numbers 5:11-31 describes the process by which a suspicious husband takes his wife before God, has the priest make her drink dirty water, which -- if she has cheated on him -- causes her to miscarry.\n \n To echo all the whining from the anti-choice religious wackos: \"It's not the baby's fault that its mother cheated!\" Apparently God doesn't care...",
