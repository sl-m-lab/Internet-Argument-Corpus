The problem is that while people in Africa are dying of thirst we are watering our lawns and washing our cars, while they starve we dump millions of tons of food into the garbage. Yes our fossil fuels and mineral deposits will be exhausted, but like electricity our food will not.

   "Yeah, it's great.\n But, Abortion avocates said that they would challenge the law in the Courts.\n\n The recently passed partial birth abortion law is going to come before the Supreme Court more sooner than later. People believe that if it comes before a Court that contains a greater number of liberal minded Justices the law will be abolished as un-Constitutional. I agree with this only if the lawyers use the same approach they have used since Roe vs. Wade.\n In reviewing this monumental case, we discover that on several occasions the Justices asked for scientific proof that the fetus is alive. This proof was never given.\n Is a fetus alive? When does a human become a human? These are two questions that are often answered differently by liberals and conservatives. Many people, including scientists, often take a philosophical approach to answering these questions. Since philosophy is only speculation, it does not belong in a courtroom. This creates the biggest problem the new law will have in standing up to the Supreme Court: the pages of explanation that accompany it are based on a common morality and not on hard science.\n I ask again, is a fetus alive? To answer this scientifically, we must ask another question; what is the basic scientific definition of being alive? A living organism according to science carries out metabolism, grows and reproduces. As soon as a sperm and egg are united, the zygote fits the definition of being alive.\n With partial birth abortions, the fact that the fetus is alive is even more evident. If it is not alive, why does the doctor have to perform an action to kill it before it is completely born?\n Often we also run into a second question; when does a human become a human? Numerous books could be quoted that give debates about this and the age-old question as to what makes a human a human. Once again, let us look at it solely from a scientific point of view. When a crime is committed and a bloodstain is found, how do scientists determine whether or not it belongs to and animal or a human? They perform a DNA test. DNA, not consciousness, should be the determinant for the fetus also. Once again, as soon as the sperm and egg untie, they contain a full human genome. Although the National Enquirer and other magazines like it may argue, humans can only create humans. This is another scientific fact.\n I believe that if the lawyers present this information to the Supreme Court, regardless of the liberal/ conservative make-up of the Justices, they would be forced to accept that a fetus is a living human and, as such, protected by the Constitution. However, if the philosophical debate is continued, the Justices will be forced to fall back on their own personal philosophical beliefs.",

Why don't we have a funeral when a woman has a miscarriage early in pregnancy? Why don't you ever see a tombstone in the graveyard saying aged -7 months?

   "You almost got it right. A living organism is has the potential of reproduction (unless biologically and abnormally impaired and unable to reproduce by this impairment). By your definition, we really would not be alive until we reproduce. So what, around puberty, 12 or 13 y/o? \n\n \n Reproduction and Growth have the same definition; reproduction of cells (growth). Some people arn't even able to every reproduce at all, genetically. However, yes, you're partially correct, it has to do with the potential of reproduction. So what? \n \n \nThere are many qualifiers to being human, solely containing the DNA does not exactly make it in my book. A zygote may contain the full human genome, but this does not make it a person. If it did, why wouldn't we name our zygotes? Why don't we celebrate our conception day rather than our birthday? Why don't we have a funeral when a woman has a miscarriage early in pregnancy? Why don't you ever see a tombstone in the graveyard saying aged -7 months? These may sound silly to you, but I think they suggest an overall attitude by our society that the moment of birth is the moment we become humans in this world.\n\n \n That's irrelivent. Quite honestly, we usually don't know the conception day, and if we did I would never feel comfortable telling people \"I had sex with my wife on this day of her fertility! Happy Conception Day, son!\" However, many cultures do celebrate the Conception instead of birth, including the Chinese.\n \n Are you saying that \"Life begins because of his birthday says so\"?",

By your definition, we really would not be alive until we reproduce. So what, around puberty, 12 or 13 y/o? \n \n It does reproduce. Its cells divide shortly after conception. This is classified as reproduction. All the cells in the human body reproduce themselves until we die. This is what it means to reproduce, not just to create another replica of ourselves. By your understanding not only would we not be alive until we were 9 years old, women would also cease to be alive after menopause. \n \n <There are many qualifiers to being human, solely containing the DNA does not exactly make it in my book. A zygote may contain the full human genome, but this does not make it a person. If it did, why wouldn't we name our zygotes? \n \n Some of us do name our zygotes :-) Others just are not prepared I guess.\n The reason an official name is not given until the child is born is that carrying a child to term without having it die is more difficult than people realize. Children also do not have to be named at the time of birth, and in some countries are even given temporary names. Also, consider that we name pets and scientists and farmers give names and numbers to other animals. Does this mean that these animals are also human upon receiving their names?\n \n <Why don't we celebrate our conception day rather than our birthday? \n \n In some countries, everybody&#8217;s birthday is celebrated on the same day at the end of the year. Does that mean that a person born in February in that country is not alive until then?\n \n <Why don't we have a funeral when a woman has a miscarriage early in pregnancy? \n \n Some women do have a funeral to help them get over it. Others prefer to just try to forget. (I am not saying that it is ever truly possible to forget, but everyone deals with grief differently.)\n \n <Why don't you ever see a tombstone in the graveyard saying aged -7 months? \n \n Even if a child is born prematurely, as soon as his head \"crowns\" is the time we begin counting his life. (Even for stillborn children.) Therefore, when you are walking in a graveyard or you look through the obituaries and you see b. Jan 7, 2000, d. Jan. 7, 2000 it is possible (an very probable) that some of these children were premature.",

Wrong again, the organism does not have to reproduce at all to be considered alive. It must have the potential to perpetuate the species (again: unless biologically and abnormally impaired and unable to reproduce by this impairment). \n \n 1. We are talking about biology which encompasses all life. Scientifically, an organism is considered alive (no matter which kingdom it resides in all the qualifiers are the same) if it meets certain criteria. Look in any high school textbook or above and you will see that these criteria for life are met by a zygote. \n 2.Dealing with whether or not it is a human is a separate factor. For this I give the DNA as a qualifier. sexuall reproduction does not qualify us as human. \n 3. Yes, an organism has to reproduce to be considered alive. Research your facts before posting them. reproduction can be in anyform - viruses are considered to reproduce even though they use a hosts cells mechanisms to do it. (They are not considered to be alive though since they can not carry out metabolism). When you consider the ability to reporduce you do not have to add the qualifier :unless biologically and abnormally impaired and unable to reproduce by this impairment. This is a given it is about whther the organisms on a whole can reproduce not whether or not certain members of the population can do it.\n \n Perhaps you do not understand what I am saying. You are trying to relate social factors and not scientific fact for your belief that a child is not a child until he or she is born. I have not met a woman yet who wanted their unborn child and did not begin caressing it (by rubbing their stomachs), talking with the child, and playing music for him/her from the moment they realized they were carrying one. In my own case, my husband and I even begin playing games with our children as early as the fourth month. We do not start earlier because the womb is not sensitive for a woman to feel the child&#8217;s response.",
