   "http://www.psych.uncc.edu/pagoolka/TypeA-B-intro.html\n OK the link is to the Jenkins Activity test which assesses you on the Alpha-Beta personality scale the results are out of 380, I score 159 which puts me towards the Beta end.\n In Biology Alpha and Beta traits have to do with breeding strategies, the theory being that dominant males will mate with more females, have more offspring in the next generation leading to more dominant behaviour and increased chance of mating and so on and so forth. The evolutionary legacy of this is that we see aggressive dominant behaviour in males in many animal species so AA is simply expressing his genetic bias in the same way as any baboon. If he detects a challenge he will see this as a threat to his abilities to impress the females with his fitness and respond accordingly. Of course this is at a near subconcious, instinctive level. He doesn't actually go through that thought process, its more \"Attack now, think later\". Conciously of course I'm not a threat his breeding rights with any females and I doubt any of the females here will be swooning at his display of \"Vigour and virility\", though we can ask them if we're curious.\n Whether we would see each other as competitors for mates is difficult to tell, seeing as we have... different tastes.\n If you were to think of an incident where your emotions got the better of you, could you identify the emotional trigger that set you off?\n \n On Zardoz point, An Omega type personality would have been hideously unlikely to make the initial \"Don't you dare\" comment, that would go against the grain.\n Whilst a Beta type may have made the initial comment they wouldn't respond to the challenge in the manner that AA did. The responce would have been to the paragraph after the challenge and been much more measured.\n He might have felt affronted but you wouldn't have seen the rage like that. A smilie would have been likely the major sign, perhaps some huffy language. But what he posted was stream of conciousness, him in an unadulterated format.\nAnd I declare myself the XYZ personality with a touch of the Higgs boson tossed in.",
