   "This topic interests me because Creationism has taken advantage of the forum of the World Wide Web as a platform to tell its message to a large and diverse audience.\n \n If you type \"creation\" or any derivatives of the word into Google and search a large volume of information is returned in the form of webpages that advocate/defend the idea. In particular, this is true with regard to the vocal body that is the Young Earth school of thought, although plenty of material can be found on other variants of creation, for example intelligent design that we are familiar with.\n \n Now, this gives an impression that there is a huge following of these ideas. However, the internet is a way of very directly getting your message to an interested individual who uses key language to filter their searches.\n \n \n Bearing this brief overview in mind I have been trying to deduce if this activity on the internet can be used as a barometer to real world interest and acceptance of Creationist ideas.\n \n Is all this material a representation of a keen, active and growing following of the beliefs such as YEC and ID?\n \n Or can this be attributed to a vocal but small number of individuals trying to compete with the considerable resources that exist on the internet on the science that explains ourselves and our universe? It is possible to have a very \"big\" virtual presence with very few people to run the operation.\n \n Or is it a sign of the times where to be heard at all you have to have a face on the www. just to keep up with the \"game\", and everybody has their own place in the space?",
