   "this is stupid. nobody acknowledges \"Darwinian evolution\" as being the forefront of evolutionary theory. we have constructed and advanced Darwin's original theory to the point where it can no longer be referred to as \"Darwin's theory\". we call it the \"Modern Synthesis\" now or modern biological synthesis - something along those lines referrs to the current evolutionary theory.\n \n im pretty sure just about everyone would agree that Darwin's original theory isnt all that accurate compared to the modern synthesis, let alone use it. thats why this is stupid. i would sign it if Darwinian theory was being used, but it isnt.",

   "This again? Sure it might be updated to have a few more names, but this is the same old Discovery Institute stupidity. \n \n First of all, 1000 names is nothing. There are 500,000 scientists is the US alone, and 1.5 million engineers. However, this list takes people from all over the world, and there are 5.8 million scientists/engineers globally. \n \n Then look at the initial question they are asking. From wikipedia:\n \n \nSuch a statement could easily be agreed to by scientists who have no doubts about evolution itself, but dispute the exclusiveness of \"Darwinism,\" that is, natural selection, when other mechanisms such as genetic drift and gene flow are being actively debated. To the layman, however, the ad gives the distinct impression that the 100 scientists question evolution itself.[4]\n\n \n Not only that, but look at the titles of the signatures. Chemistry? Electrical Engineering? Geology? Physics? Agronomy? Computer Science? Psychology? Mathematics? Astronomy? Nutrition and Food Science? What would any of those people know about evolution???\n \n \n Also, a lot of the 'experts' in the field aren't even who the Discovery Institute says they are. Several have 'honorary degrees' or maybe attended or did something for a university for a year or something. Discovery picked and chose what would be most impressive sounding and placed that title on the list. There are tons of people on that list who have never even worked as scientists. \n \n Just because someone has a PhD in front of their name or is a professor somewhere doesn't mean they are an expert in a completely unrelated field. They might as well have asked coal miners, preachers, elementary school teachers, and auto mechanics... they have just as many qualifications in the field of evolution as a computer science expert does. \n \n This whole list is nonsense. It was originally done in 2001 with about 700 signees after \"a decade of work.\" Not only are the vast majority completely unrelated and unqualified to give a real account of the theory of evolution, but some of them might not even disagree with evolution in the first place. \n \n What is also funny, is that a counter petition was made and in 4 days had 7,733 signatures as opposed to the anti-evolution petition taking a decade to get only 700. \n \n It can all be found here.\n \n A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Anything from the Disco is immediately questionable and this is no different. It is completely intellectually dishonest and represents well under 1% of engineers/scientists in the first place.",

   "\"\" We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.\"\n \n Dissent from Darwin\n \n Names from some pretty reputable institutions on that list.\n\n First of all, \"Darwinian theory\" didn't include mutation. Darwin had no concept of any such mechanism. Darwin recognized that in all populations of organisms there existed a vast amount of genetic diversity. But Darwin didn't know and didn't offer an opinion as the the source of that diversity. It is, in fact, as a result of careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory that the other mechanisms of evolution, besides natural selection, have been discovered. Thus, the assertion that careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged is a boat that sailed over 100 years ago. Darwin's evidence was examined from day one.\n \n So now let's examine the first sentence of the manifesto: \"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life.\"\n \n How wonderful! A total of 737 scientists, not a whole lot of whom are evolutionary biologists, have signed this document. Now consider that about 1% of PhD scientists are named some form of \"Steve.\" Thus, the Steve List, named in honor of the late Stephen Jay Gould. Originally intended to be signed by PhD biologists named Steve, the list also includes other prominent scientists from other disciplines, including Stephen Hawking. The signatories of the Steve List accept the tenets of evolutionary theory while they reject creationism and ID creationism. To date, there are 1157 PhD scientists (about half are biologists) who have signed the Steve document.\n \n Now you do the math. By my calculations that equates to only about 0.6% of PhD scientists who are creationists or IDcreationists. While neither list actually restricts signatories to biologists, both claim to include only PhD scientists. Upon closer examination, that seems to hold true for the Steve list but not the IDcreationist list. Moreover, biologists seem to be more numerous on the Steve list.\n \n As for the \"reputable institutions on that list,\" that is a boondoggle, since individuals signed the list, not institutions. My bet is that every \"reputable institution\" represented on your list is also represented on the Steve list.",

   "An update:\n \n There are, as of 6/16/2011, 1165 Phd scientists who have signed the Steve List. These are biologists, geologists, or paleontologists for the most part, although a stray cosmologist or two may be in there. But the math still comes out to about 0.633% of scientists being creationists - if the Darwin list were actually legitimate.\n \n As for the list of scientists who oppose Darwinism, I recently read an article that told of the efforts of one scientist to contact everyone on that list. Many could not be located. Many (almost half) do not have Phd degrees in a related field or do not have Phd degrees at all. Most are not affiliated with the institution named although some may have attended that institution for undergraduate work. Some of these \"scientists\" could not be found and their named institution had no record of them ever attending or being employed. The worst part is that some of the scientists say that they never signed the list in the first place. All in all, it's a pretty shoddy list, but in line with the scientific quality of the work of creationists and IDcreationists.",
