   "Check out the smartest liberal to date: comment?\n \n \n More and more, I'm reminded of something a friend said to me back in 1986 and realizing that \"By God, he's absolytely right!\" *shudder*...\n \n A very good friend of mine, a tinkerer, gun collector, libertarian, social liberal rabble rouser and heartbrother, is also a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association. He is the sort of person who is probably in total agreement with Michael Moore, but also a regular attendee at gun shows. For the longest time, I thought his stance was very strange. How could someone who is farther to the left than I am, even consider the NRA, let alone be a lifetime menber and fervent supporter?\n \n So I asked him. And here is what I learned:\n \n The NRA (according to my friend) has adopted the public stance that the Constitutional amendment regarding \"the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\" is the point on which it will make its stand. The hidden 5,000 lb elephant in the room is that the REASON the right shall not be infringed is that some day the right to bear arms *against our own leaders* may become critical!\n \n As the old Sixties saying goes, \"if you lose the right to say '****', you also lose the right to say '**** the government!' and that's a loss this nation cannot endure.\n \n If we lose the right to buy guns, *ANY* guns, (big, little, assault, hunting, automatic, shoulder-fired, chain, artillary, etc) we lose the ability to look the government straight in the eye (or straight in the rangefinder) and say \"**** YOU, you fascist *******!\" BLAM!\n \n The NRA has had to fight the \"Awww, come ON, now!!!\" reaction from the anti-gun folks. I was one of these. For DECADES I have fought against the NRA. I've thought they were totally off the wall. That, of course, is why they have not publicized that aspect of the right to bear arms.\n \n For years, my stance has been \"I don't have a gun and I don't feel threatened. Why do you need an assault rifle or a bazooka?! Can't the NRA accept even the TINIEST margin of 'infringement' on that right?!\"\n \n That was then. This is now. Yes, the NRA is riddled with right wingers. Yes, the membership (in general!! not in totality) is likely to be on board with this current misAdministration. But if is high time we liberals begin to see that on the aspect of defending outselves against the current crop of criminals in power, they're right on the money!\n \n So here you have it. My public apology to the NRA (and to all its members) and to my friend.\n \n I was wrong. You, the NRA and many (if not the overwhelming majority!) of \"cold-dead-hands gun nuts\" were RIGHT. It is high time we liberals bagan joining the NRA, buying the tools of democracy (Sweet Jesus, I can NOT believe I'm saying this!!) and taking lessons in how to acquire, store, clean, aim and FIRE those tools!\n \n My stance, now, is changed. \"I don't have a gun.... YET!\"\n \n Hearing about the plans to possibly postpone or cancel the elections... It takes a strong person to admit that a lifelong commitment to a view is in error. I think many of us need to re-assess our stances WRT weaponry. The time is coming when we're gonna need them. It's coming faster than I ever thought possible.\n \n Comments?",

   "That's all well and good as long as you can dehumanize the \"government\".\n Good luck repelling the army, national guard or ATF. They just might be your neighbors and family.\n\n \n Yes, they might, and in any uprising or revolution you are likely to have this. That is the nature of war, which is why people generally strive to avoid it. \n \n People who cannot dehumanize their enemy end up dead quickly, either becuse of hesitation on the field of battle or the kill themselves. \n \n As far as whether they could be repelled or not, no problem. We only have 500,000 combat troops in this country, and 300 million citizens. Even if only a third of those citizens took up arms against the miltary, you are still looking at 100 million people (give or take). Tehre is no possibility that a combat force of 500,000 is going to stand for long in front of an insurgency of 100,000,000 people. You could rush them with rocks and bury them and smother them with the bodies of the dead and still outlast them.",
