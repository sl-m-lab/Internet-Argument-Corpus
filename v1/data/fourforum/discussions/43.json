   "The regulation of free speech is specifically prohibited to the Congress and the entire of the Federal Government by the specific language of the 1st Amendment; the language is, \"Congress shall make NO law...\" and this means JUST what it says, that Congress is prohibited from proscribing any form of speech in any fashion whatever. Where, then, is the power? The power to proscribe speech must lie in the powers that delegated the Federal Government's power to it at the Constitutional Convention: the States, or the people (as organized in the Counties, Parishes and Municipalities).",

   "Although I am honesty not fully aware or close to being fully aware of this complete history of the US constitution, I think that the case at hand does not apply. Of course the the historical facts of free speech and the constituion in a whole are important, but to me its not a matter if we are allowed to but if we should be able to. (John Calhoun) - With the various historical implications of the 1A its very possible that by law and according to law only you should not be able to. But by moral standards I think that flag burning is justifiable. \n \n \n Gilligan: \" i own the flag; i burn the flag. my property; my right. \"\n \n If the burning of the flag is carried out by 1. Its owner and is truly the owners property than surely he should be allowed to do w/e he wishes with it. (Of course there are alot more implications with other property such as houses in a suburban area.)\n \n anyways thats really all I have to say about this topic.\n But I will continue to read this thread if it doesn't involve history facts that I know nothing about\n ;) \n \n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

People break covenant with God all the time, what do you think backsliding is?\n \n Fine, the constitution is an ETERNAL compact.\n \nOnce more. The Constitution, being a Federal document , is only properly applicable to the Federal Government.\n \n OK, the constitution certainly has impacts on the states. All of Article I Sec. 10 are powers forbidden to the states. The full faith and credit clause (Art. IV Sec. 1) dictates how states must act towards each other. And the supremacy clause (VI.2) clearly dictates that the constitution is the overriding supreme law, even over state law \"The constitution...shall be the supreme law of the land; ans the judges in every STATE (emphasis added) shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any STATE to the contrary notwithstanding.\" Your claim of no application to the states is baseless and is refuted countless times in the text of the constitution itself. When the constitution specifically references the states, the states are impacted. The document applies to everything within the US. states are within the US, therefore they are affected.\n \nHow is an action 'speech'? I just finished a college course in Free Speech law, and for the life of me I can't see how an ACTION is speech.\n \n That must of been one weak class, if it didn't reference symbolic speech. Talk to your professor about Stromberg v. California. As was put by Carol Jenson, professor at University of Wisconsin, La Crosse \"[the] stromberg opinion is considered a milestone in first amendment constitutional law, for it was the first ruling in which a court majority extended the 14th amednment to include a protection of first amendment substance- in this case symbolic speech- from state encroachement.\" Tinker v. Des Moines and (the now famous) Texas v. Johnson also would be good cases to reference.\n \nOf course they are NATIONAL guarentees, properly applicable to interstate issues. Burning a flag in one location in one sovreign State is in no way, shape or form an interstate issue, and therefore falls under the State Police Power.\n \n the problem here comes from the subtle distinction between \"national\" and \"interstate.\" It is a national interest in the sense that it deals with a right guarenteed across the nation, even if it occurs in one state. You seem to forget that states are within the nation, so a rights violation has to occur in a state first, unless for some reason the federal govt. tried to across the board take away our rights (oh wait, they did, can someone say \"USA Patriot act?\"). But a national interest, in this case protection of rights, doesn't cease to be national just because the actual rights violation itself happens locally.

   "OK, before I state my opinion on this matter allow me to apologize for brining up a somewhat old topic. I have done this simply because I have recently written a short essay on the topic, and I would like to toss my own opinion in this topic. I do not say much around here, usually I just lurk, but I enjoy debating this topic.\n \n Once again, forgive me for dragging up a seemingly dead thread.\n \n This topic has reminded me of a news story I read several months ago. In it a highschool girl (a senior, I believe) would turn her back away from the United States flag while the National Anthem played before a basketball game commenced. Through this act she displayed her opposition to the current acts performed and decisions made by the US government. \n \n During the middle of her game, while she stood before the basketball goal preparing to take a free shot, a vietnam war veteran ran onto the court with a flag in hand. He began waving the flag in front of her face and screaming of its significance. Eventually security of some sort escorted the man away from the girl and out of the building. \n \n Click here for the story from my local newspaper.\n \n In my history class we would discuss current events every Thursday. Each student would bring in a news clipping of some sort, stapled onto a sheet of notebook paper describing the story the student had chosen. When we began discussing this particular story a great majority of the class took sides with the old man, and I understand why. \n \n A Nation's flag holds many representations. Without going into too much detail, it can represent the past, the present, and the future. It represents the past by serving as a reminder to those who faught for the country and its purpose. \n \n It represents the present through current events. The current mode and happenings of the country, whether good or bad. \n \n Then it represents the future. The goals of the country and where the country might find itself headed can hold a very strong representation through the flag.\n \n This a flag holds, and much more. \n \n One of the strongest reasons for opposition to flag burning and any general disrespect to a nation's flag (particularly the flag of the United States) regards the represenation of the past. One may constantly hear that so many people have died for the freedom or life that a person experiences in their country at present, and through disrespect of the flag they show disrespect to these people. \n \n While this sounds like a very lovely idea, and I can understand it more than one might expect, I do not think this should act as a reason that keeps one from demonstrating their disgruntlement with the affairs of their country. \n \n Using the United States as an example, let us say an old man tells me that I should not disrespect the flag because so many people have faught and died for my freedoms. Does this statement not contradict itself? Does their dying for my freedoms, including the freedom of speech (through a number of ways, not just through using the voice), restrict me from excercising these freedoms to their fullest extent? \n \n I think I can burn a flag, rip a flag, or throw a flag away without showing disrespect to those who died to keep my freedoms secured. If I do not wish to accept or agree with what I find my government currently doing, could I not use a symbol of the government in its present state to act also as a symbol of my displeasement with the government? Could I not use a symbol respresenting a government's possible future also as a symbol for my irritation as to what direction the government appears to currently go? \n \n If I wish to make a strong statement through symbolism would my statement not become stronger by using a nation's symbol as my own symbol--against that nation? \n \n If a flag represents the freedoms so many people have faught and died for then the restriction of one of these freedoms would have caused so many people to die in vain. As I have had many people tell me, thousands of men and women have died so that I may have the freedoms I have now. In order to honor these people for their acts of bravery, I will use those freedoms. I will fight against the restriction of any of those freedoms.

However, it is only a symbol. By itself, it means nothing. (Try defining American flag without using America, the United States, or any other term that is commonly used as a name for the US.
