   "nope, just a single book. and creationists say that we don't have good evidence\n\n \n Can you see why this dumb user was banned? lol\n Most thinking people can't be bothered giving people like the above the time of day, but I'll try:\n \n Firstly, we creationists are more logical than you think. We beleive what the bible claims; that God created everything (Gen. 1:5, 31; 2:4), right, got that? We also believe what the bible says; God is such a powerful spirit (or force if you want to be scientific) that if any man were to see Him, he'd die! God told one of his faithful worshipers: \"No man may see me and yet live.\" (Exodus 33:20) God is a Spirit, and humans cannot see him with their physical eyes. (John 4:24) Just as looking directly at the sun at midday would be disastrous to our eyes, so it would be devastating for us to see the tremendous source of energy that created not only our brilliant sun but also the countless other suns in the#universe. You think about it, if God made the sun, which has to be an average of 93,000,000 miles away from the earth (in order that we don't burn up!), how powerfull and distant do you think He would have to be from the earth??? If he's that far away do you think that todays scientists are going to reach and detect him with their probes to prove his existance? lol, i don't think so. Man only managed to set foot on the moon just over 30 years ago. Man is still very primative, we know nothing about the universe! And to make a claim that God doesn't exist is more than just stupid. It's as stupid as saying that nobody built your house, and yet that's what people say about the universe (which is much more complex).\n \n The next question would probably be, if God does exist, then why doesn't he give us a sign? After all, He used to perform miracles for Noah, the Isrealites etc, He even sent Jesus down to earth 2000 years ago, so where is he now when the earth needs Him the most??? Well, you'll just have to speak to your local Jehovahs Witness for that answer and many many more (including, what's the purpose of life? Why is there so much suffering in the world?)",

There are that many holes in the evolution theory it's a joke. \n\n \n Oh God, not again. You're correct in the fact that the fossil record doesn't prove evolution. Fossils, being the lithified remains of long dead organisms, have great problems providing any evidence on thier genetic make-up. What the fossil record does show is cases where, over time, modifications can be seen in animals morphology. There is also the fact you can find animals which are 'almost' another type of animal. A good example is Synapsids (otherwise known as 'Mammal-like reptiles'). The fossil record provides data which is best explained by the ToE, rather than 'Goddidit'. The argument between ToE and ID is not something in which the fossil record can be involved.\n \n As far as I can tell, you don't talk about God as the personalised deity that most mainstream christian traditions talk about. In fact you seem to have a rather 'hippy-ish' view in that God is an energy. Just so you know, the idea that humans die when seeing Gods goes back at least as far as the ancient Greeks. Zeus killed one of his lovers when she demanded to see him in his true form (just by the power revealed in him). I think she was the mother of Perseus or something....\n \n Just so you know, if God is a force, we've probably already picked him out and got him down as an unexplained physical constant, and if he's a spirit, we can't pick him up scientifically, and therefore aren't trying to prove him or disprove him. It's true that we are not hugely advanced in terms of our understanding, but we are hugely advanced beyond 5-600 years ago, when the christians were doing thier best to burn anyone who asked questions. Nowadays we agree that Gallileo was a very smart man, rather than a heretic. Religion still has a place today, but it no longer directs the entire course of human life.",

In fact, some people are immune to the bubonic plague. Is that what you are talking about? And there are people who have been infected with the HIV virus that do not get AIDS. That has also been identified as a genetic mutation.\n \nWhy be an evolutionist when all you have to do is argue about it?\nActually, we do much more. But the question could be as well put to creationists. You, for example, what is you point in being here.\n \nI agree with Evolutions_Fake, he has strong points that i think are worth listening to\nWhich points are those and why do you think they are strong?

His objections for religious reasons contribute nothing. He says that inventing gods is sad just before he tells us about his invented god. How is that supposed to be answered. You see, evolutions_fake is almost as much of an atheist as many others on this board. It's just that others believe in one less god than he does.

And yet I should think that he knows enough to correct me?\n \nI know it's because you are competly [sic] avoiding the point he is making and you simply cannot answer his questions.\nThen you haven't been reading. His questions were answered by pointing out his errors in biology and evolutionary theory. In other words, why his questions are nonsense for the most part. For example, in a discussion of genetics he said that the dark moth became dominant without even understanding the meaning of the word dominant. Even after it was explained to him, both he and ww showed that they didn't understand. How can we answer questions when you and your friends don't even try to learn enough to understand them?\n \nWascallywabbit is also correct by saying you are arrogant.\nAnd you aren't? How is it that you can come here and tell me that I am arrogant because I know more about the topic than you? It is projection on your part. You haven't studied this topic and know next to nothing and yet you are so arrogant that you think that I should give your often debunked religious babble equal consideration to tested science.\n \nPersonnaly [sic] i think most of you evolutionists on here have way to big egos and act like children.\nSo you haven't contributed anything - you haven't expressed a reasoned view, you haven't answered any questions, you haven't offered any objections to the science under discussion, and you haven't offered alternative answers to any of it, but you have offered ad hominem attacks.
