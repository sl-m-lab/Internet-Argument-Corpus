   "I don't know if I'm the \"hawk\" you're looking for, but I'll play some Israeli defense.\n \n First, a few observations:\n Siegfriedson and I differ on what grounds the US should make foreign policy interventions. He's an isolationist, and to the extent that he thinks we should act out he thinks we should do it for the benefit of white, christian nations. I'm an interventionist, I think the US needs to take an active stance throughout the world in favor of the moral principles we uphold: liberty, democracy, et. al. Since there's a paradigm difference here, we might agree on all questions of fact and still disagree on whether the US FP position is correct.\n \n Second of all, a comprehensive look at the Israeli/Palestinean conflict cannot a) be primarily dependent on the UN, as it is not an impartial arbiter and b) cannot start in 1967, but rather at the turn of the century when the debate over whether to establish a Jewish homeland in Israel began.\n \n Ok, let's start with the Observer article. First of all, it gives no analysis as to the background of 242, how Israel is in \"flagerant breach of it,\" and most importantly, under what grounds the author believes Israel should withdraw. \n \n The lands in question in 242 were conquered by Israel in the 1967 six day war. The war began when Egypt blockaded the Israeli port of Elat and, along with Jordan, began massing its forces along the border to attack Israel. Since the lands in question were gained in the epitome of a defensive war, and since Israel's security situation has not significantly changed since that war, the Israeli's can legitimately claim to be holding the territory for security purposes. This is not to say that 242 is irrelevant, but rather that it must be viewed in a context of give and take: Israel gives back the land in exchange for real, quantifiable peace. Since the arab and Palestinean people have refused to grant this, Israel isn't under any obligation to return the land at this time. The question that needs to be asked is: What conditions do the PALESTINEANS have to meet in order to get the land? Obviously, a global system is unsustainable if a country can launch a war and then, upon losing, claim there should be NO condition or penalty for their aggression. Yet that is precisely what the author suggests.\n \n This is supported by relevant treaty law. Under the Oslo Accords, the specific grounds under which Israel would allow a Palestinean state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip was the recognition of the Israeli state and the cessation of terrorism. Neither of these have been met. Whereas Israel HAS made a good faith effort to fulfill its part of the bargain (transfering lands to PA authority, unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip), the PA has not made even a perfunctory effort to halt terrorism, and has not even taken the largely symbolic step of recognizing Israelis existance. The PA is material breach of the Oslo accords in this respect.\n \n The author also claims hypocrisy in US enforcement of UN resolutions on Iraq vs. Israel. This is true to an extent, however it is more revealing of the UN than it is of the US. At best, the UN resolutions on Iraq were a pretext for US invasion, had no UN resolution ever been passed, Iraq would still have been ruled by the same oppressive dictator, still posed the same regional threat, and still would probably have earned the ire of the Bush admin. The UN has no moral authority to speak on Israel because virtually all of its members have a conflict of interest: Either they are dependent on Arab oil (which, as the 73 oil embargo taught is, is contingent on anti-Israel policies), or they are the Arab countries for whom anti-semetic rhetoric is a key plank to their control (by both appeasing the radical islamic base and turning citizen anger at oppressive living conditions and zero freedom away from the controlling regime). To be fair, there is US and global hypocrisy when it comes to Israel, but it comes in the eloquent words of Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press on April 14 2002, \"When suicide bombers attacked America last September, nothing could stop our retaliation. Yet when suicide bombers attack Israel, week after week, Israel is told -- even by Americans -- to back off. When we bombed Afghanistan, where Al Qaeda was organized, it was a mission to \"smoke them out.\" Yet when Israel attacks its hornet's nest of terror, it is accused of \"occupying\" and told to retreat. When we fired on Kabul, we said innocent people would be caught in the crossfire and, sadly, this was war. Yet when Israeli soldiers go door to door in Palestinian areas, we call them \"murderers\" the moment one civilian is killed. How can we not call this Hypocrisy?\"\n \n Furthermore, the above claims represent a fundamental misunderstanding of the status of said territoires. When the creation of an Israeli state was first proposed, the British came out with the Balfour Declaration, which said that the entire territory of Palestine (at the time, including all of current Israel, the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jordan) should be set aside for an Jewish state. This was clearly unfair, as it didn't give a state to the Arab peoples living in the region. So in 1922 the British announced the partition plan, which divided Palestine into a Jewish state (current Israel + West Bank) and a Palestinean one (Jordan). This is the plan that should be controlling: It creates one Palestinean and one Jewish state, with the Palestinean state double the size of the Israeli one. Someone needs to explain to me why that plan should not be the one adopted or why it is unfair. Not only that, but these are the only borders not set by war or arab pressure, including the pre-1967 borders which were set after the 1949 Independence War. Adopting the 1922 Partition borders as controlling is of course politically impossible. But it does give plausabilty to Israeli claims of jurisdiction over the territory and makes the implicit Palestinean claim that the West Bank is unquestionably \"their\" land demonstrably false.\n \n Finally comes the question of causality. An inherent presumption of Palestinean apologists in the US and abroad is that Israel has to act first, that its continued presence in the WB is the aggrevating factor and that if it withdraws or makes concessions, terrorism will drop. Unfortunately, this a belied by the facts. First of all, the PLO terrorist group (Arafat's organization) was founded 5 years before the 1967 war even STARTED, so Palestinean terror cannot honestly be traced to Israeli occupation, but rather to the mere fact of Israel's existance. Second, analysis of terrorism rates before and after Israeli concessions reveal that the highest level terrorism rates all occured AFTER Israel offered concessions. For example, terrorism murder rates soared 73% higher in the 2 years after the Oslo Accords were signed compared to the two years before. And the Palestinean intifada was launched after Israel offered to recognize an independent Palestinean state with a capitol in east Jerusalem on 96% of the West Bank, an excellent deal considering that Israel had just endured the worst terrorism spate in the last decade of its entire existance. The worst terror years for Israel since 1967, in descending order, were 1996, 1994, 1993, and 1995, all after the Oslo Accords were signed. And yet by 1996, 96% of all Arabs living in the West Bank were living under PA authority, meaning that practically the occupation was over. In this light, the claim that Israeli concessions will yield a cessation of terrorist activity is clearly fallacious.",

   "Btw, the PLO's rejection of Israel's right to exist isn't just conjecture on my part:\n \n Look to Article 19 of the Palestinean Liberation Organizaiton's Official Charter:\n \"Article 19: The partition of Palestine in 1947 and the establishment of the state of Israel are entirely illegal, regardless of the passage of time, because they were contrary to the will of the Palestinian people and to their natural right in their homeland, and inconsistent with the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, particularly the right to self-determination.\"\n \n Nor does the PLO desire a peaceful resolution of the conflict:\n \"Article 9: Armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine. Thus it is the overall strategy, not merely a tactical phase. The Palestinian Arab people assert their absolute determination and firm resolution to continue their armed struggle and to work for an armed popular revolution for the liberation of their country and their return to it. They also assert their right to normal life in Palestine and to exercise their right to self-determination and sovereignty over it.\n Article 10: Commando action constitutes the nucleus of the Palestinian popular liberation war. This requires its escalation, comprehensiveness, and the mobilization of all the Palestinian popular and educational efforts and their organization and involvement in the armed Palestinian revolution. It also requires the achieving of unity for the national (watani) struggle among the different groupings of the Palestinian people, and between the Palestinian people and the Arab masses, so as to secure the continuation of the revolution, its escalation, and victory.\n ...\n Article 21: The Arab Palestinian people, expressing themselves by the armed Palestinian revolution, reject all solutions which are substitutes for the total liberation of Palestine and reject all proposals aiming at the liquidation of the Palestinian problem, or its internationalization.\"",

They have, and continue to, forcefully expand their borders and regularly exacerbate the situation in the areas of tension. \n \n They are not guilt free when it comes to terrorism either, especially not historically. It was zionist radicals that wrote the book on terrorist tactics in their efforts to depose the British. The same ones that cry bloody murder when their own tactics are used against them.\n \n Finally, I disagree with the notion that an accord drawn up by the British in 1922 should form the basis of a binding nation state contract for two unrelated political, national, and cultural entities. It would be like Canada dictating that you should give the the entire southwestern USA to Mexico. How would that sit with you? How do think the average US citizen would react to such a decree? IMHO, the borders must by specified and agreed upon by those involved.\n \n A note about US vs. Israelis hypocrisy - which side is the hypocrit? That one could go either way IMHO, depending on who you feel is right to begin with.\n \n Waxy\n \n ON EDIT: Also, for every PLO or Hamas, there are zionist groups, maybe not as large, vocal and active, but every bit as extreme in their views.",

   "Oh absolutely. I don't mean to claim that the Israel's are saints (though I am a bit confused about the \"continuing to expand their borders\" bit, what other territory has Israel tried to gain in the past 20 years? Indeed, Israel has had a net LOSS in territory in the past 30 years or so, giving back the giant Sinai Peninsula to Egypt). However, in terms of overall culpability, the Israeli's clearly aren't at fault.\n \n And while Israel's tactics against the British arguably were terroristic (is that a word?), they certainly don't rise to the level of Palestinean terror. Israeli partisans generally confined themselves to military targets, attempted to minimize civilian casualties, and never engaged in suicide bombings. Furthermore, mainstream Israeli fighters actually made good faith efforts to stop the actions of their extremist comrades (witness David Ben-Guerin ordering the sinking of an Irgun weapons runner ship).\n \n My claim as to the Partition plan is not that its legally binding, it clearly isn't. The question is whether it MORALLY is the proper line division. A twostate solution with Palestinean state twice the size of the Israeli one is tough to oppose on the grounds that it isn't fair to the Palestineans. Unfortunately for your otherwise delightful doctrine of \"all parties agreeing to the final borders,\" the Palestineans have yet to agree to ANY agreement that includes the continued existance of Israel, regardless of its size. This includes rejections of the 1922 partition plan, three seperate plans forwarded in the 1930s, the 1948 UN partition plan, the 1967 borders, and the 2000 camp david proposal which would have given Palestine 96% of the West Bank for their state, including East Jerusalem. It should be noted that each of these plans, with the exception of the 1948/1967 plans, gave progressively more land to the Palestineans than the one before it.\n \n And finally, as for the existance of zionist extremist groups (the phrase \"zionist group\" is misleading, as one can be a zionist and not be a terrorist, indeed, one can be a zionist and still be a member of the Israeli peace party, they aren't mutually exclusive terms), that is undeniably true. There will always be extremist groups, a tragic fact of a war that has lasted almost a century. But the difference, again, comes in the good faith effort of the Shin Bet and IDF to STOP these terrorists. Whereas the PA barely even pretends to try and stop their terrorist comrades (and in many cases actively supports them, eg Tanzim, Al-Aqsa Brigades, and Force 17 all of which are part of Arafat's Fatah party, the leading group of the PLO and PA), their Israeli counterparts have unquestionably worked to stop terrorist activity on their end.",

   "To clear up a really big misunderstanding about the Bush policy: Its not pre-emption, its prevention. Very different, and on much shakier legal and moral ground.\n \n I'm kinda a hawk I guess, though I'm rarely described as such. I wouldn't really characterize myself as anymore Hawkish than Bill Clinton, who understood that the US, as the global hegemon, had to take a proactive world to prevent human rights abuses and defend democratic ideals across the world. I don't care if that makes me a hawk, dove, interventionist, pre-empter, preventer, idealist, realist, or communist. Its just the moral thing to do.\n \n Now, on the substance (such as it is).\n \n Look to the Albom analysis I give. Bad things happen in war. Its unfortunate that when Israeli and Palestinean forces battle each other, innocents get killed. For the record, when Israeli's shoot into crowds, they do so with rubber bullets and beanbag guns, typical tactics of anti-riot police the world over (including the US). Those are non-lethal dispersal tactics.\n \n But moving back to the larger issue of culpability. The Geneva Conventions require that armies take every possible step to avoid civilian casualties, and require them to avoid targeting civilian population centers. HOWEVER, IF a army (force, guerrilla group, whatever), sets up base in a civilian population center (as Palestinean terror groups do), then legally it is the DEFENDING group that is held responsible for civilian casualties in that area. Once again, it is Palestinean action that is legally culpable for the deaths of innocent persons.\n \n I'm curious as to YOUR opinion as to what grounds the US needs in order to intiate a foreign policy intervention. You said that you would support it if we were attacked (which I doubt anyone disagrees with). But if that's the ONLY grounds for US intervention abroad, then you're as extreme an isolationist as Siegfriedson is.",

   "Siegfriedson and I differ on what grounds the US should make foreign policy interventions. He's an isolationist, and to the extent that he thinks we should act out he thinks we should do it for the benefit of white, christian nations. I'm an interventionist, I think the US needs to take an active stance throughout the world in favor of the moral principles we uphold: liberty, democracy, et. al. Since there's a paradigm difference here, we might agree on all questions of fact and still disagree on whether the US FP position is correct.\n\n \n That is correct, I am indeed an isolationist. I highly value nations' sovereignty and they should be free to sort out their own affairs, without the \"liberating\" presence of American CIA agents and soldiers.\n \n Regarding my stance on the Jewish/Palestinian issue, as I wrote to you in another thread:\n \n I do believe that the Jews deserve the land of Palestine that they call Israel. They fought multiple wars and defeated their enemies in combat, therefore the Jews earned the title to that land. However, this fact does not change two things:\n \n 1) The Palestinians have the right to try to take it back\n 2) If the Jews want an ethnocentric Zionist state in the Middle East, that is their perogative, but they should not be utilizing billions of Gentile dollars to accomplish this task.",

   "Oddly enough though, you say NEOCONS shouldn't support Israel when your opposition to it predominantly isolationist (Neocons of course are big on intervention).\n \n All your comparative reasons on why Israel is as bad as Iraq are based on how the UN treats it, but the problem is that neocons don't really take the UN seriously (nor do I, and if you're a true isolationist nor do you). Sure, they'll pay it lip service at times, and they'll use it if the facts fall in there favor, but its merely a means to an end, and if the UN stands in the way of the neocons end they'll simply ignore (as they did in Iraq). UN opposition to Israel is a weak arg. for Neocons to oppose Israel. Those facts (in threads 1 and 3) aren't \"horrifying,\" they just show that we spend alot of money on Israel and that the UN doesn't like them. Shocking.\n \n The last thread you power-tagged. \"Foreign Agent on our soil\"? I'm definitely pro-Israel (and Jewish), but I'm not an Israeli citizen and I'm most certainly an American. Being pro-Israel doesn't make me any more \"foreign\" than being pro-german makes you German. Its an expression of Foreign Policy sentiment. Furthermore, all it shows is that politicians are trying to get votes. Again, who here is stunned?\n \n The second thread, in addition to being a biased source (mainstream media anyone?), is also contextually false. Look to the point I made about the Geneva conventions. If a armed group bases itself in a city (which palestinean terror groups are doing, and Israeli forces are invading to root out), then THEY are the legally responsible party for any civilian casualties caused by the offensive parties attack. Hence all the \"crimes\" you cite are legally the fault of the Palestineans.",
