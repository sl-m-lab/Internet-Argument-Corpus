While Canada's long time interest advantage was investor friendly, the forthcoming agreement to sell China Alberta oil offers offset to any future reduction in net US trade due to the US dollar. Future rate increases to remain competitive, not for cash flow demands, is a a nice position to be in and in line with China's enormous trade potential. Canada's successful effort to reduce deficit spending has produced very positive results. \n \n Canada's current trade mission visiting a receptive China at the prime minister level speaks volumes about Canada's intent, ability and expertise. \n Bush's political tariffs against Canada are becoming meaningless.",

Without sufficient capacity to slaughter, you are stuck being a cattle salesman, with slaughter capablitly, you can sell beef. IF you are simply selling cattle, you are stuck selling to the US market, since whole, live cattle are expensive to ship overseas. Beef, on the other hand, is cheap to ship and fetches a premium.\n \n I think canada could do a pretty good market just selling to nations that won't buy US beef.

Average weekly manufacturing hours were unchanged.~\n\n \n Just a little translation fo those who don't follow economic indicators.....\n \n index of consumer expectations....A measure of households expectations or beliefs regarding economic health (present or future). This is a survey. Economic professionals (or households with an economic professional residing there) are automatically excluded. \n \n Stock prices.....Stock prices are up. You would be hard pressed to find a decent broker or financial planner who does not call the market overvalued and warn that it is important here lately to hedge carefully, but prices ARE up.\n \n Real money supply.....This is cash in hand, and real money supply is also up. I am not entirely sure why this is a positive indicator, since real money supply being up usualy indicates a low demand for expansion capitol. Also, when real money supply shifts to the right (more on hand), interest rates fall. Currently real money is relatively high (mostly due to corporations bringing profits in from off shore branches, since currently they can do so and pay a 5% tax instead of the regular 35%), but interest rates are going UP. While an increased real money supply is certainly a good thing, I have trouble envisioning a worse long term indicator than interest rates rising in the face of relatively high real money availability.\n \n average weekly first-time claims for unemployment benefits....this one is self explanatory,\n \n The declining indicators are pretty self explanatory as well. With the possible exception of the stock prices being up, which could be due to increased US industrial performance (though it is not and we all know it), it seems that what this is really saying is that despite the fact that there is no demand for expansion capitol, interest rates are going up, manufaturers who are not in the defense industry are SOL, and new construction is down, your average American is still optomistic about our economy. brilliant.\n \n \nFew Americans will be concerned with anything other than lead paragraph so-called good news, based on transactions that drive GDP but offer little true economic value. The declining indicators, 60% by category, offer a far better indicator of economic growth by value, negative in this instance.\n \n From what I can determine, America's primary fear is reality.\n\n \n I would say you are correct here. ICE is WAY up. The good side to this, I suppose, is that for every dollar somebody makes, somebody, somewhere looses one, and there seems to be plenty of folks lined up around the block to loose their hard earned bucks.",
