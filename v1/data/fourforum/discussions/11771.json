   "The practice of nuclear genocide (I mean the using of bomb with depleted uranium) realized by USA in former Yugoslavia and then in Iraq and Afghanistan could be added to Saakashvili's arsenal! Look, it's clear that he is going to use those bombs (which came from USA by US Navy) as revenge against South Ossetia and Abkhazia! I think that before American military crimes will not get punished their followers in some counties like Georgia where they will feel safely! Moreover Saakashvili is supported by the White House and Pentagon (who went too far in encouraging of his madness) will be able to unleash the nuclear war in the world. He will do it rather than Iran or North Korea!",
