   "Is it not writen, that 'Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall'.\n Matthew 12:24-15, Luke 11:16-18, Mark 3:24-26\n \n If the Word of God as manifest in the holy Christian Bible is true, then is not true that the Church, the body of self professed Christians, in ruins?\n \n Even on these forums, there are cries of being a 'True Christian' vs pretenders. There is conflict over correct doctrine (and if you don't know what or how important it is to a Christian, then you might want to take some time to learn) and dogma (really not that important save when it conflicts with doctrine and causes strife in the Church or detracts from worship of God) that has divided the House since it's inception, Paul even wrote about it. Each passing year sees further division and conflict.\n \n This is abundantly evident.\n \n If the Word of the Christ is true, stated in 3 seperate gospels, when he was talking about how the followers of perdition would not heal as that goes against their nature and doing so would cause the kingdom of Satan to collapse, how much more so would this apply to the Kingdom of God whose followers quibble and murder one another? After all...he did say ANY kingdom.\n \n Of course, I could also toss out many other passages stating avoidance of strife and extolling one to follow correct doctrine and I could do the same warning you of false prophets and wolves who come to devour. Truely, it stands to reason that if the great deceiver can appear as an angle of light as stated in scripture and cause harm to the 'body' then most 'Christians' follow the creed of Satan, even if unknowingly. And if it is writen that many will seek yet few will find and it is writen that some will have done works in the name of Chirst yet he Knew them not and cast them away...heck, a lot of thing are writen but the general gist is most all 'Christians' are going to hell and the kingdom of God is ruin due to the rampant divisions. So, really, why bother?\n \n Might as well be honest with yourself and take up your own banner. You can at least be sure that your kingdom isn't divided. Well...not unless you have a self destructive nature. Then there really is no hope for you. But, if you're smart enough, you can blame someone else for the problems you cause!\n \n I'm sure someone will think that 'Even Satan can quote scripture'.\n But, I'd say to that, only a weasly god would write scripture that could be turned to any design, both heavenly and diabolical.",

   "There will always be irreconcilable differences between the Holy Spirit and the spirit of this world. Christ has, is, and will continue to divide people, pulling them away from this world and into his Kingdom. Even though we still fight against this flesh, it will inevitably come down to our spirits that will fight against the spirit of this world.\n \n I know what you're getting at, and it's something that should concern some religions, including Christianity, but that is not the gist of what Christ was talking about. He was talking about the baptism of the Holy Spirit and how He longed for it to happen. And He knew that in order for us accept Him that we would have a fight on our hands from ourselves, our egos, our way of life. Folks don't want to let go of things that have comforted them, even though those comforts have a tendency to make them miserable.\n \n So, just looking at those scriptures, or any scripture, and not linking them together in context, you would think He is talking about any house, kingdom, religion, or establishment.",

   "They are in context and about the same issue and echoed thrice over.\n \n I do understand what you're getting at and just recently was in a discussion on being lead by the Holy Spirit. IMO, most people who claim to follow the Holy Spirit...aren't. You could argue that it's either their own egos and subconscious desires or whisperings of the deceiver...\n \n Scripture does state you should know one by the fruit he bears. But to me, the teachings on subjects of good/evil are primitive and childish. Most who think they bear good fruit would, to me, be a barren fig tree. \n Also, a truely evil entity could work at times against his nature so as to gain the trust of his mark. I'd also believe through reason that a supposedly truely Spirit lead person should do no wrong if they are following 100% of what Spirit leads...and if they are getting a message that either isn't beneficial or is garbled and hard to understand, then it would seem to not be the Spirit (as why would God, an omnipotent entity do so...it's against His nature to confuse).\n \n So, if you desire to be Spirit Led and open yourself up through prayer and faith to be so, how you you be lead to a false prophet? \n Today, countless well meaning people are milked and bleed by liars because they place too much on the nebulous Spirit thing and ignore established scripture, they read only certain parts of their bible it seems.\n \n From my learning and experience, while the Holy Spirit is talked about for centuries in most sects, it is 'dry' and would be called lifeless by some. As a Cultural Catholic, the Spirit is mentioned in services but it appear as words to most with no real substance. \n It seems that the counterfeit movements like Pentecostalism took something little talked and known about and 'jazzed' it up. Then used it as the foundations for heresy and apostacy and led many to embrace contra biblical beliefs, practices and ideas. Pushing counterfeit after counterfeit. \n Today, more people often seem to place all their faith in and easily counterfeited Spirit than in sound doctrine and scriptural knowledge. I guess it's easier to listen to your own heart than to crack a book and think...which is what it seems to boil down to.\n \n The Jehovahs Witnesses, Mormons and a host of others are 'Spirit lead' to their beliefs.\n \n I've even been in discussions with ernest Christians who try to do both yet seem to express the idea that they can't even find a church let along sect capable of doing it.\n If such is the state of the House of the Lord, why really bother? For all you know you could be one of most who's simply getting it wrong and will be punished for your mistake.\n \n I can understand your insight on how Christ is dividing but isn't the only division in scripture along the lines of the Wheat from the Tares? If the 'true believer' who is getting it right is the good wheat and the non believer the tare, then what are those who try sincearly to get it right yet unknowingly fail in their zealous drive for rightiousness, the blemished grain. Does the Lord take the damaged grain or is it too cast into the flames?\n \n What of those who are lead away from the fold because they can't tell a real shephard from a gluttonous wolf? \n Is it ones desire and faith that is pleasing to the Lord as stated in scripture or is it following the truth, the path and the light that is needed?\n If the former, then wouldn't non Christians possibly make it to heaven?\n \n I'd like to think I have some ability to see a portion of th Byzantine weave here above others who really aren't even interested, but as an outsider looking in, why would I bother? If I bothered, which sect to follow? Especially when each is damning the other and claiming to be the only way to get it right...and if they don't believe they are the only way, why follow them?",

   "I thik I see where both of you are coming from. One must remember that the body of christ, are people, not denominations. I have seen remarkable unity across denominations. There are certainly divisions within organizations. However, the christian doctrine is that the body of christ is not formed by those boundaries. It is strictly those whom christ has chosen is it not. There may be seeming divisions especially, Zardoz, when one goes by \"professing\" christians.\n \n I am thinking that in all reality if there is a God and this was indeed important to him then only HE would really know who is a part of the unified body and who is not. In fact, their unity is one of the ways you can tell that they are a part of the \"body of christ\". Didn't jesus say, \"By this all men will know that you are my disciples, your love for one another.\" It seems like that is the telltale sign. So when you see those that sow violence, discord, disunity, you could probably make a guess about what Jesus would think.\n \n Huck",

   "As a cultural Catholic myself, I'd have to say there is division in the 'church' history. The Universal church has iteself changed and adapted over the ages to being nearly unidentifiable from it's original form. The whole protestant movement is a division to the 'Church' (Catholicism). How can one truely say that what remains, Catholicism was what God truely wanted when it was apparent that many practices were new dogma that lead away from correct following of scripture. The whole selling of indulgences comes to mind. Or portions of the Church who came to venerate the blessed Mary to the point of Idolotry. Even the whole heirarchy is questionable (no matter what sect) as I no longer need a intermediary between myself and the Lord due to the new covenant and sacrifice made by the Christ. This isn't just Catholics, most Protestors have a 'Man of God' who 'covers them'. Failing to see that they only covering they need is the Christ.\n \n Of course, I would say that the protestor reformation, while needed, was a horrible failure and if the Church was truely of Gods desire, the legitimate complaints of the time would not have existed.\n \n As to human divisions, it is these division that lead to continued confusion and grief for successive generations of potentially new Christians.\n Why would a God allow for such divisions within His Church?\n If the archetect of confusion has reign over the House (after coming in and tying up the strong man as scripture states of course) then one could even argue as to the power of this God to begin with and at the least whether some of the goals of the Christ were even accomplished when He said 'It is Finished'.\n \n As for interdenominational unity, oft times, it comes at a sacrifice to doctrine. Is it not writen to flee from those who teach a different gosple? Is it not writen to not be yoked to the unbeliever?\n If I work with those who disageree with the triune nature of God, who take salvation from the cross and place it elsewhere, who profess to be Spirit lead whilst abusing their flocks for filthy lucre to a common goal such as humanitarian good, does that not mean I compromise my faith and seek to operate in the flesh rather in the Spirit?\n \n As for the desires of the Christ, he did state in scripture that he came to bring a sword, that his followers would be loathed, and that they could not love Him unless they also hated their family.\n \n It seems to me that from it's inception that the bible was doomed to forment division, conflict and ruin. More useful for jack booted thugs than for the Prince of Peace...but, I guess enforced conformity could be construed as a form of 'peace.' \n \n As for those who sow discord. How could one properly discern whether it is due to design of hell or simply because those who the hear truth refuse to listen and cling to thir carnal ways?\n I recall once sitting in Catholic Mass once and a visiting Bishop having the audacity to teach a little fire and brimstone on how many will stand around at a funeral and cling to the good a person did and say that they were destined for heaven whilst overlooking the unrepentant sins of the deceased that in truth, doomed them to hell. People actually got up and left.\n \n But, I gues we go where our ears are tickled. We'd rather sit in a barren field under a promissing rain cloud that refuses to pour than to take the meat and milk.",

The allowing of even a man who doesn't have his own household in order to occupy a position of authority in a congregation?\n \n \n \nI'm afraid you've lost me. Are you saying that plurality itself is heresy, regardless of what that plurality entails? If so, I don't agree. Heresy is departure from the tenets of the faith as laid down in the orthodox creeds. When one group prefers singing \"low-church\" hymns as opposed to \"high-church\", that's not heresy. When one group sprinkles instead of immerses, that's not heresy.\n\n I follow you but, yeah, for some sects, sprinkling doesn't count. You're as good and unbaptized and thus doomed to the lake of evah lastin' hellfire. Furthermore, some even call for a baptismal of the Holy Spirit or you're doomed. EZ's own AoG faith chases after a sign like an adulterous nation in the form of counterfeit tongues as proof that you're saved and those who don't have this initial proof aren't saved. Totally ignoring contradictorary scripture and reinterpreting what it even means to suit their own desires.\n \n It's the difference between doctrine and dogma that most can't even seem to understand exists.\n Do you take communion at every service or just once a month or when you feel like it?\n Do you allow women to wear pants or must they dress immodestly?\n If you believe in a rapture, do you believe it'll come pre, mid or post tribulation?\n Those are dogmatic issues but, often such isn't noticed and thus many think it's a fundamental doctrinal issue.\n \n \nBut you were talking about division within the Church (denominations). Now you've shifted to an example clearly outside of the Church and Christianity altogether. This isn't a discussion on different religions, or at least it hasn't been up to this point. If that's where you want to go, then of course I agree with you.\n\n \n I can understand that it seems to be apples and oranges but, one who follows a different gospel of Jesus the Christ IS no better than one of the heathens and thus is also doomed. \n If you say plurality is a good thing, what proofs do you have other than brainwashing by an unsaved mass that panders to the 'flesh' and knows not the true path to salvation? If these pluralties are good, why haven't you adapted them? If you've done so, how much doctrine have you compromized?\n \n The old arguement in homosexuality is one. To be honest, scripture, even the bits in Red, preach out against sexual immorality of all kinds. Sodom and Gomorrah are used as examples along with others to illustrait Gods displeasure...and if you don't think they are talking about oral/anal sex, then where did we get the term Sodomy to mean those practices from?\n \n It's very Orwellian to watch many sects squirm to try to make Scripture comply with what their current desires are rather than the other way around and do as scripture states and make ones life conform to Gods will as expressed in the bible. 30 years ago, this really wouldn't be an issue. It hasn't been until recent years that gayness has been acceptable on the level it is.\n \n \n The only think I think of at the moment for plurality is the strife it brings and the quote, \"I find comfort from those I agree with and growth from those I don't.\"",

   "There is no such a thing as the Anglican Church. What you mean is the Church Of England. How can a Church wich began life as a poor excuse for a and adulterous king to obtain annulment from a legitimate marriage be called catholic? \n The Pope only has authority over those who accept it. It is not a temporal but a spiritual one.\n\n \n Well, after Henry the Church definitely wasn't protestant, it was simply returning to the same status national churches had up until the strengthening of the papacy over the previous couples of centuries. For me, Anglicanism dates from Elizabeth I, not from Henry.",

   "ok I forgot about this thread a lot has been said since I last posted, i will address issues I am more familiar with and in reverse order.\n \n \n\"Well, after Henry the Church definitely wasn't protestant\"\n\n \n Actually Elizabeth I was very a devout protestant, Henry 8th was reletively Catholic in his faith the pope giving him the title \"defender of the faith\" for his stedfastness against protestantism prior to his temptation to sin.\n Life for the Catholic under henry was not the best but it was paradise compared to life under his daughter.\n \n \"one who follows a different gospel of Jesus the Christ IS no better than one of the heathens and thus is also doomed.\"\n \n you speak sense ALBEIT misguided\n \n \n\"It's very Orwellian to watch many sects squirm to try to make Scripture comply with what their current desires are rather than the other way around and do as scripture states and make ones life conform to Gods will as expressed in the bible. 30 years ago, this really wouldn't be an issue.

Communion being a big issue.\"\n\n \n Doctrinly the Orthodox share the same faith as the Catholic Church except for a very few and very minor objections.\n \n \n\"You have missed the distinction between Roman Catholicism, and actual Catholicism\"\n\n \n There is no such thing as \"roman\" catholicism. Roman was added to the title of the Church after the reformation in order to hijack the term \"catholic\" so as to refer to all christian denominations. Actually the Church never has refered to itself as \"Roman Catholic Church\" and only sometimes refrers to itself as \"Catholic Church\" the church perfers to call herself just that \"The Church\" although she does use the term \"catholic\" in regards to her universality. to say that the Church and the pope are the governing body solely of Roman (latin rite) Catholics is to do an injustice to our Bretheren such as \"Dominican Catholics, bizatine Catholics, Coptic Catholics, Hebrew Catholics, ambrosian Catholics, antiochian catholics, armenian catholics, melkite catholics ethiopian catholics and so on, the Pope and the Holy see is the governing body of these Catholics too.... The Pope and the Holy See is the Catholic (universal) authority of the faith. Within these Rites there are many different liturgical rites of worship that incorperate cultural differences but we are all of one doctrine, one leadership, one body, one spirit in Christ.\n \n It is rather insulting to Call the Catholic Church - the Roman Catholic Church although many wear it proudly as a medal of their persecution.\n \n \n\"The Bible does not call for uniformity. \"\n\n \n Yes it does and very very often in regards belief, not so much in cultural difference. \n \n For example I as a Roman (latin rite, Gentile) Catholic do not abstain from eating bacon, i do not live as a Jew but I have a duty to respect Hebrew Catholics who are entered into the mosaic covenant. \n \n \n\"The Universal church has iteself changed and adapted over the ages to being nearly unidentifiable from it's original form.\"\n\n \n A man is born and over time he changes, does he not remain the same man?\n \n the things that make him the same man remain but his apperance has changed. The Mass, the Eucharist, the Sacraments, those things that make us who we are remain the same....so we have fancy clothing and big buildings, we have grown in size and our outward appearnece maybe changed but inwardly all those things which make us Catholic remains the same.\n \n \n\"How can one truely say that what remains, Catholicism was what God truely wanted when it was apparent that many practices were new dogma that lead away from correct following of scripture.\"\n\n \n like what?\n \n \n\"The whole selling of indulgences comes to mind.\"\n\n \n Never a practice or a doctrine or a dogma of the Church - it was a abuse by a few priests.\n \n The offering of Indulgences were around before the abuse and are still offered today, its not/was not the indulgences but the selling of that was the problem.\n \n \n\"portions of the Church who came to venerate the blessed Mary to the point of Idolotry.\"\n\n \n The worship of our lady is clearly condemned by the governing body of the Catholic faith, anyone who practices marian worship commits idolotary which is a sin that means they are excommunicated from the eucharist and the believer must repent of this wickedness and go to confession. \n \n \n\"Even the whole heirarchy is questionable\"\n\n \n There is no question that pope benedict is the predercesor of Pope Peter I, as for the hirarchy, not so much a hiarachy than a lowarchy, that is \"the greatest amongst you must be your servant\" the pope is a servent sent by god to the layity.\n \n \n\"As to human divisions, it is these division that lead to continued confusion and grief for successive generations of potentially new Christians.\"\n\n \n Amen to that!\n \n \"Do not argue amongst yourselves for it profits you not and only brings destruction to those who are listening\"\n \n \n \n\"Why would a God allow for such divisions within His Church?\"\n\n \n the protestant faith is not his Church, the members are lost sheep in the clutches of wolves in sheeps clothing. \n \n The catholic Faith is his Church, the Shepherds he sends after his own heart, \"we are from god whoever listens to us, is of God, whoever does not listen to us is not of God, this is how we know the spirit of Truth from the spirit of Falsehood.\"\n \n \n\"If the archetect of confusion has reign over the House \"\n\n \n over who's house - christs house or martin luthers house?\n \n The one built on the Rock (St Peter) or the one built on the sand (Luther)\n \n \n\"it comes at a sacrifice to doctrine. Is it not writen to flee from those who teach a different gosple? Is it not writen to not be yoked to the unbeliever?\n If I work with those who disageree with the triune nature of God, who take salvation from the cross and place it elsewhere, who profess to be Spirit lead whilst abusing their flocks for filthy lucre to a common goal such as humanitarian good, does that not mean I compromise my faith and seek to operate in the flesh rather in the Spirit?\"\n\n \n your words are spirit and they are truth!",
