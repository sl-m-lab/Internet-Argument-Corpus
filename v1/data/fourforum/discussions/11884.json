   "Continued from A long-term view on abortion, 'cos it was getting mixed in with the actual on-topic stuff.\n \n There could well be a lot of opportunity for semantic mix-ups in this post/thread, so I'm going to define what I'm going to use now. This could be part of where our problem stems from, in fact.\n \n Morals - these deal with whether something is 'good' or 'bad'. \n Facts - these deal with whether something is 'true' or 'false'. \n Subjective knowledge - moral/fact value depends on the observer\n Objective knowledge - moral/fact value is independent of the observer.\n \n For the purposes of the argument so far, scientific knowledge is objective fact. That is: a piece of scientific knowledge is either 'true' or 'false', regardless of the observer. (No, this isn't the case in all situations (quantum/relativity), but just to clarify/give an example).\n \n Strong moral relativists (such as myself) hold that moral action is subjective. That is - a moral action (for example - murder) is either 'good' or 'bad' depending on the observer. Another way of putting it is that I deny that there is a moral 'truth' by which to judge someone's opinion.\n Moral absolutists (such as Phyllis - I don't know if (s)he is strong or weak) hold that moral action is objective. That is (for example) murder is always bad, regardless of the observer - an observer may have a different moral opinion, but they would be factually incorrect in that opinion.\n \n My grounds for believing that morals are relative stems, quite simply, from the fact that morals are a human construct. Before humanity, there were no morals, and there shaln't be any after we are gone. As such, why should each human being believe in an identical set of morals? If 'good' and 'evil' do not exist, then it is nonsensical to say that a specific action is 'ultimately evil', because you are comparing that action to something non-existant.\n \n \nIf it is true that there are no objective moral truths, then a moral relativist must logically deny the truth of any claim of moral objectivity. That is the only conclusion that can follow from the premise. So, if a moral objectivest says, \"X is objectively immoral,\" the relativist logically must deny that as being a true statement. The relativist must say, \"It is false that X is objectively immoral.\" Notice that that reply is not saying that X is moral. It is simply negating the objectivist's claim. But that negation is itself a moral claim which, to be effective, must be objectively true. But were it to be so, then the conclusion contradicts the premise.\n\n I would disagree that the phrase \"It is false that X is objectively immoral\" is a moral statement. Let's say 'X' is 'murder', for the sake of example.\n The statement \"Murder is objectively immoral\" can be further split into two parts. \"Murder is objective\" and \"Murder is immoral\". Thus when the phrase is countered, only the first part (the 'murder is objective') is countered.\n To contradict your starting phrase, all I need say is \"Murder is subjective\". While I may have my own opinions on the morality of murder, I need not include them in the contradiction. To say 'murder is subjective' is not a moral statement.",

   "Interesting argument. I would suggest editing your definitions of subjective/objective knowledge by replacing \"morals/fact\" with \"truth\", since you follow by saying facts are already objective. \n \n I don't think its as simple as saying morals are a human construct, therefore it cannot be factual. Its not that we can say that arithmetic is not factual because humans constructed it. The principles of arithmetic would persist well beyond the existence of mankind, and morality, for the discussion's sake, could well be the same way. \n \n My personal take on morality is not really that morality cannot be objective, but rather that the sources/authority that define what action is absolutely moral or immoral doesn't seem to exist. For example, perhaps murder could well be an action that is absolutely immoral. Simple enough. But who's to say exactly what qualifies as murder? If my car ran over your dog, is that murder? Second degree? Dogslaughter? Doesn't count because its a dog? Now things get a lot more complicated. We have to determine first if objective morality exists, and if it does how and to what degree can it be applied on a case by case basis.",

   "Interesting argument. I would suggest editing your definitions of subjective/objective knowledge by replacing \"morals/fact\" with \"truth\", since you follow by saying facts are already objective.\nNot 'all facts', only 'scientific knowledge' - and only as we had used it so far in the previous thread. There are many people who use the term 'moral fact', which I want to avoid if possible because it makes the water murky. Facts can be 'true' or 'untrue', morals can be 'good' or 'bad'. Yes, people's opinion of the moral can be 'true/untrue', but that is the opinion, not the moral itself.\n \n This is the important distinction for me. There are the four combinations - subjective morals (moral relativist stance), objective morals (absolutist stance), subjective facts (a ball I throw is moving 'away'/'towards' an observer) and objective facts (the velocity of the speed of light in a vacuum is 3e8 m/s). \n Thus - you cannot have moral facts, and you cannot have factual morals. You can have people considering a fact to be (im)moral ('evolution is evil!'), or people considering a moral to be factual ('I agree that murder is evil'), but this deals with what people believe about the moral/fact, not the thing itself. If this is not the case, then Phyllis' paradox from the initial post becomes harder to solve.\n \n \nI don't think its as simple as saying morals are a human construct, therefore it cannot be factual. Its not that we can say that arithmetic is not factual because humans constructed it. The principles of arithmetic would persist well beyond the existence of mankind, and morality, for the discussion's sake, could well be the same way.\n\n Not so. The principles of mathematics were listed by humans, not constructed by them. Agreed, humans constructed the way we portray numbers, the symbols, decimal system, etc, but the pure numbers themselves were there long before we were, and will continue to be so.\n \n If human life ceased to exist, would any action be moral, given that there is no possible way by which someone could choose to prevent that action? If a rock falls and crushes a bird, do we call the rock evil?",

Just my 2 cents.\n \n \nMorals - these deal with whether something is 'good' or 'bad'.\n \n Not sure if this changes much, but the way I understand and use moral propositions is in terms of \"right\" and \"wrong.\" Additionally, the nature of morality is such that it confers an obligation--it gives us \"oughts\" and \"ought nots.\" Thus, morality as I understand and use the term, governs whether I ought to do something, or whether I ought not to do something.\n \n \nMoral absolutists (such as Phyllis - I don't know if (s)he is strong or weak) hold that moral action is objective.\n\n I hold that moral absolutes do exist.

You certainly could split it first by saying \"Murder is objective.\" But to focus on that would be to altar the proposition.

And in our example, that seems to be the case.\n \n The moral objectivist need not establish that the definition of \"murder\" is objective. Murder is a descriptive term. It is used simply to summarize an action.

I just avoided 'right' and 'wrong' as phrases because they can also imply the 'true' and 'untrue' that you get from facts. You can give the 'wrong' answer - which might not necessarily be the 'evil' answer.\n \n 'Ought' is good, though.\n \n I still don't think I defined the 'moral' terms quite right, however - as a later part of your post exploits. I think the best way is to split it up further. We have a human action - for example (see that later part of your post), murder. We then also have a moral consideration of that action - whether murder is 'good' or 'evil'. Unfortunately, the way to explain this in a phrase is 'my morals are that murder is immoral' - or, more confusingly, 'my moral is that altruism is moral' - and showing which 'moral' is which is, I think, adding to the chaos.

However, I see some fairly major prerequisites in order for this to be the case - and given that I'm an agnostic atheist, I reject them for lack of evidence.\n \n I'm treating the statement \"morality is objectively subjective\" as a scientific fact, in the same way that I can say \"bodies with mass objectively always attract each other\".

And in our example, that seems to be the case.\n\n That doesn't work. Here's why:\n \n Suppose I state that 'Food is Objectively Delicious'. Immediately you can see a problem: 'delicious' is an inherently subjective quality, so slapping 'objectively' in front of it is a non-sequitur. But suppose we fail to spot that and push on regardless. I support my statement by saying that although what the word 'Food' refers to may vary from observer to observer, they will all agree that food is delicious.\n \n Of course, I haven't really proved that food is objectively delicious. I've merely constructed a circular definition that you are unable to disagree with: 'Food' is defined by what people eat, and they eat what they do because it's delicious. So it is with the statement 'Murder is Objectively Immoral'. Because the specific act to which 'murder' refers is ambiguous, it ends up being defined by 'Immoral', creating a circle of logic whose impenetrability gives the illusion of truth. \n \n All that might make you think I'm arguing the case for moral relativism. However, we can approach the problem from a different angle.\n \n If morality is absolute, then it exists outwith any human definition of the concept, yes? It existed before we had a word for it, before we had any conscious grasp of it at all. So let's put ourselves in that position again, and say:\n \n \"Murder is objectively spong.\"\n \n Spong refers to another objective quality, of which we presently have no conscious knowledge or appreciation. Is the statement above true?\n \n The answer depends upon whether we manage to come up with a definition of spong that makes it true. Observe:\n \n \"Apples fall because of blib.\"\n \n If we manage to define 'blib' as 'gravity' with all its attendant properties, then we've constructed an objectively true statement, one with which the universe agrees independent of any observer. Which would appear to offer hope to moral absolutism: if we can come up with a definition of 'moral' that the universe agrees with, surely that counts as an absolute definition?\n \n No; I don't think it does. The universe is an observer. The laws it has determines what works and what does not, what happens and what does not. Those laws are superior to us, but they are not truly absolute. They could be other than they are. If I run a computer simulation, any entities living within it would perceive the laws by which it operates as absolute, but they are not.\n \n So I fall somewhere between relativism and absolutism: I think that in this universe certain things work and certain things don't, and that applies as much to interactions between living creatures as it does to the chemistry of the muscles that move them around or the aerodynamics that hold them aloft. As far as we're concerned, social mores that work constitute 'absolute' morality: they are the intangible truth to which we strive to match our own definition of morality, just as we attempt to match our theories of gravity to the real behaviour of objects under its influence. But that 'absolute' is not truly absolute, it is merely our universe's opinion on the matter :)",

   "Another opinion", 
   "I get the impression that the only two alternatives that are being argued here for morality are (1) there is an absolute set of moral rules, or (2) morality is purely relative. My personal view is that there is no absolute morality but also that morality is not purely relative but does follow various trends that are partly dictated by logic and partly by average human nature itself. \n \n To address these trends, one has to ask oneself what morality is. Is morality simply an organized statement of our emotional reaction to situations - ex. murder makes us feel bad so it must be bad? I suspect that, for many people, this is the bottom line. However, if we look at the \"big picture\", then morality is essentially a set of rules of conduct for societies that let people interact with each other in a way that makes the society work. Wouldn't you agree?\n \n What a particular society aims for may vary from group to group since different groups (as well as different individuals within the group) might have different priorities and values - most of these tending to be conditioned by upbringing within a particular society. For example, many Eastern cultures stress community involvement and subjugating one's own will for the sake of the good of the community - to the extent that people are brought up with cultural expectations of themselves and others that such a balance will be made between their own needs and the needs of the community. In the US, on the other hand, there is a pioneer tradition of rugged individualism that is often at odds with requirements of community living. Within both communities, there are also wide varieties of opinions on how this balance of individual vs community should be made.\n \n Nevertheless, despite differences among people's, there are also trends that are part of human nature itself. For example, people the world over suffer pain when murdered or harmed, they regret the loss of cherished possessions - leading to major trends in moral rules against un-necessary violence or against theft. Cultural differences may dictate the details of when one can kill or steal and when one cannot, but these two general rules seem prevalent the world over. So, trends are important when speaking of moral rules.\n \n Logic comes into play when one considers that moral rules are essentially a moral consensus among individuals in how they will treat each other. It is illogical for someone to expect that they should be excluded from a moral rule (that they would themselves impose on others) simply because they don't feel like adhering to it. It is only logical that, if someone expects others to follow a moral rule, they themselves should be ready to apply it to themselves as well. Otherwise they are being hypocrites - a type of illogic. This is expressed in many cultures in various ways - from the golden rule of \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\" to Kant's categorical imperative \"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\" to simple statements by so many mothers to their children \"How would you like it if that happened to you\"... If one wants to keep a moral consensus to organize societies, then it has to be reciprocal. Otherwise, why would anyone agree to a lopsided rule (unless compelled to by force). \n \n So, I hope I have made my point that trends in human nature and logic of moral consensus both present constraints on the relativism of morality, even if one discards the notion of moral absolutes.\n \n ---on edit---\n \n One other point that should be added is that moral rules can vary from group to group based on their perceptions of reality. There are wide arrays of religion that dictate a reality that shows now evidence of itself yet which, nonetheless, present absolute moral rules based on the assumption of a reality dictated by their religion - an assumed reality of a benevolent God that dictates certain moral rules. Adherents to these religions often feel absolute confidence in the validity of their moral rules and often don't feel the need to support those rules with reasons or evidence. This has led to anything from religiously inspired self-sacrifice to save the lives of others, to religiously inspired self-sacrifice to kill others for a cause. The trouble with such thinking is that it can be quite arbitrary and independent of observed reality. If one claims that it is a virtue to blindly follow the rules of one's religion, then how can one make the arguement that Militant Islamic Suicide bombers who also blindly follow the rules of their religion are wrong? I would much prefer to have moral rules that are based on reality that is demonstratable to others through science, etc., than moral rules that are blindly followed.",

   "Moral clarity, as derived from belief in an absolute code of morality, has its pros and cons.\n\n \n I'd have to agree with this thesis but on different grounds, it is the purely philosophical perspective that employs relativity as a codec of behavioral governance that would have a problem with an absolute and universal truth in this instance.\n \n \n \nI would agree that the confidence that such moral clarity brings can make for a more effective self-policing of ones actions than would a more relative approach to morality.\n\n \n \n It is funny that you cite that specifically... as during lunch to go run errands I had a chance to listen to one of my favorite theologians RC Sproul, he was mentioning the fundamental differences in cultural philosophies from blowing across the Atlantic to those natively forged here, and pragmatism [as it were] has its roots here stateside, yet relativism is so strong in Europe. They too forge behavior and is an adoptive birthright of sorts, and I can attest to that having lived in Europe for while. They view us as brazen and bold... aggressive.

For example, just because people have sex before marriage does not mean that they are jumping from partner to partner. Just because someone is gay doesn't mean that he will be a \"flaming\" homosexual, showing it off to everyone, or that he will be learing at heterosexual men or that he is in any way evil or automatically sexually promiscuous. Just because someone is of another religion (ex. Budhist, Muslim, etc.) does not mean that the person lacks morals or \"goodness\". Just because someone is an atheist does not mean that they are automatically selfish and immoral. There are a lot of assumptions made by people who follow absolute rules that are simply not based on reality. \n \nWell this is where your argument turns more into talking points and I am sure you understand why, for one... theology is the world process for parsing our individual world views, not science. We look inward before we look outward... If I am to use your analogy, Allah is not known to be the universal god of reward based on their quid-pro-quo social activity. So that is not gonna fly...

Even though these so-called historical accounts were more greed that anything to do with religion... however the mind than needs to have an issue there will not resolve this but use it as a crutch to support all manner of antipathy and indifference particularly with regard to moral absolutes.\n\n I am not really following your arguement here, could you elaborate? Why do you think that extremists are not driven by their religion? There are certainly enough quotes in the Koran that could be interpreted to support their view, just as there are quotes in the Bible (stoning of adulterers, killing every man, woman and child in hostile states, etc - mostly in the Old Testament) that could be interpreted to justify very nasty behavior. \n \nThis I can agree with... but I think we can all say with certainty that there is overwhelming emprical evidence that moral good based on absolute truth hasn't hurt anyone... it has made choices harder, but it has created an excellent chraracter in those who submit to it. But has made lifestyle choices more challenging, it is for the greater good.\n\n Moral good based on absolute truth lie behind the motivation of Islamic terrorists, drive the hatred of homosexuals that have led to many a hate crime, has led to the persecution of the Jews throughout most of history, etc. As long as the \"absolute truth\" is not analyzed and judged but blindly assumed to be right, many problems can arise. That is not to say that much good has come from it as well. Since most people do not go through the trouble of analyzing their own actions, the prevalence of absolute morality might have, on average, done more good than harm. However, what I am mainly arguing against is the blind following of absolute rules. If moral rules are reasoned out, I do not care if they were inspired by religion or by secular philosophy since thoroughly reasoning out moral rules (and hearing out and not ignoring all oposing views) is far less likely to lead to the bad results that have been brought up by absolute moral stances.\n \nI agree in part with your comments here, but I must be clear... if left to only what could be proved socially, secularism has had more randomness to it... more blind idological servatude and has produce the most social discord. Moral clarity is and has only been a problem for those who are self indulgent - history will bear this out. Well argued points... from a persepctive different than mine. But you can see where I am coming from as well you wise in pointing out.\n\n Yes, secularism has had more randomness to it and has allowed the self indulgent to often act irresponsibly. I think that a large cause of this is that the very term and discussion of morality has, in recent years / decades, been hijacked by the Religious Right. Nowadays, when one starts talking of morality, a lot of people will just roll their eyes in annoyance since the term \"morality\" is often automatically associated with the strict, blind, arbitrary and intolerant morality of the religious right. The term \"ethics\" has partly taken its place, but not enough. I think discussions on morality have to be taken back from absolutists so that both sides can discuss it. Then, those who don't espouse absolutist moral stances can also hear community discussion on moral issues that are not nearly common enough nowadays outside of the Religious Right.",

   "Continued from A long-term view on abortion, 'cos it was getting mixed in with the actual on-topic stuff.\n \n There could well be a lot of opportunity for semantic mix-ups in this post/thread, so I'm going to define what I'm going to use now. This could be part of where our problem stems from, in fact.\n \n Morals - these deal with whether something is 'good' or 'bad'. \n Facts - these deal with whether something is 'true' or 'false'. \n Subjective knowledge - moral/fact value depends on the observer\n Objective knowledge - moral/fact value is independent of the observer.\n \n For the purposes of the argument so far, scientific knowledge is objective fact. That is: a piece of scientific knowledge is either 'true' or 'false', regardless of the observer. (No, this isn't the case in all situations (quantum/relativity), but just to clarify/give an example).\n \n Strong moral relativists (such as myself) hold that moral action is subjective. That is - a moral action (for example - murder) is either 'good' or 'bad' depending on the observer. Another way of putting it is that I deny that there is a moral 'truth' by which to judge someone's opinion.\n Moral absolutists (such as Phyllis - I don't know if (s)he is strong or weak) hold that moral action is objective. That is (for example) murder is always bad, regardless of the observer - an observer may have a different moral opinion, but they would be factually incorrect in that opinion.\n \n My grounds for believing that morals are relative stems, quite simply, from the fact that morals are a human construct. Before humanity, there were no morals, and there shaln't be any after we are gone. As such, why should each human being believe in an identical set of morals? If 'good' and 'evil' do not exist, then it is nonsensical to say that a specific action is 'ultimately evil', because you are comparing that action to something non-existant.\n \n \n I would disagree that the phrase \"It is false that X is objectively immoral\" is a moral statement. Let's say 'X' is 'murder', for the sake of example.\n The statement \"Murder is objectively immoral\" can be further split into two parts. \"Murder is objective\" and \"Murder is immoral\". Thus when the phrase is countered, only the first part (the 'murder is objective') is countered.\n To contradict your starting phrase, all I need say is \"Murder is subjective\". While I may have my own opinions on the morality of murder, I need not include them in the contradiction. To say 'murder is subjective' is not a moral statement.\n\n \n No moral absolutes leads to chaos and every man doing 'what is right in his own eyes'. \n Morally wrong to rape my 5 year old granddaughter? Morally wrong for me to tie the purp onto a rock in winter snow where he will be naked until he is found in the spring? Morally wrong for the gov't to pervert justice and let the perv purp go free because the 5 yr old didn't have a coherent story?\n \n A moral code that is Just may help bring peace to the world, but man's desire to pervert justice for cash or security will never allow it to happen. :)\n \n That is because too many people can not tolerate human trash hurting the innocent. I realize that is changing and that hurting the innocent is now sport for many more people, but I do not worry about that so much.\n \n Absolute morality and absolute justice will prevail. Meanwhile I just do what I can. :)",

   "I like these definitions, may I add \"Moral Fact - A evaluation of good or bad which is true or false\"\n \n And clarify your \"of observer\" to \"of observers perspective\".\n\n Absolutely. Our argument, then, would be whether a 'moral fact' is subjective (varies between observers) or objective (is the same regardless of observer).\n \n I'd say that 'of observer' and 'of observers perspective' are more or less synonymous, but given that different people can have similar perspectives it's a good clarification.\n \nInteresting, I don't believe there are any subjective facts in science, simply misunderstood concepts.\n \n For instance relativity speaks of the appearance of motion from different perspectives, and the equations that describe the truth independent of them\nIt depends on what you want to describe as 'the (scientific) truth'. It's certainly true that things which are universally seen as objective are revealed to be subjective. An excellent example is (the simplified version of) the Twins paradox - take twins Alice and Bob, put Bob on a spaceship and send him out on a there-and-back journey at relativistic speeds. For Bob, the whole trip may have only taken three days (depending on how fast/far he is going), but Alice might now be 50 years older. The passage of time is subjective - it depends on the relative speeds of the observer and traveller (technically acceleration is also involved, but that's the more complex version of the paradox).\n As for quantum, we get the notion that observation changes whatever is observed - so it's impossible for two people to make identical observations of the same thing. While it's not quite subjectivity, there's certainly plenty of evidence (google wave/particle duality of buckyballs for some mind-blowage, or watch a program called 'how long is a piece of string' for Alan Davies trying to explain it) that our philosophical view of 'reality' requires something of a rethink.\n \n \nWhich negates the concept of morality, what if it was my perspective that I could kill you right now and it wouldn't be wrong?\nIt wouldn't be immoral from your point of view - though it probably would from mine! It would still be illegal, but legality and morality are far from synonymous. See below)\n \n \nYou must then admit that you can't form a law (which is supposed to detail what is allowed and implicitly what is good or evil) except by the most commonly held opinion?\nI agree with all of this apart from the italicised. Many people have the moral opinion that it is 'good' to follow the law, but that is a moral opinion, and thus (from my POV) subjective. Furthermore, it should be obvious that there is a disconnect between the law and morality - pick a contentious law and you will see that many disagree with it on moral grounds (as examples: the foxhunting ban in the UK, abortion laws, gay marriage laws)\n \n As far as I can see, this isn't so much an admission as a statement of how things work. Laws are made based on the (sometimes moral, sometimes not) opinions of the majority of lawmakers, whoever they may be. Personally, I'd say that laws should be made with the intent to improve the quality of life of the population as a whole - sometimes that inherently requires a moral opinion, but often it does not.\n \n \nSo is thought, and therefore all forms of thought including science. \nI'm not sure that thought is a human construction so much as it is the thing which enables us to make constructions. You can have thought without humanity - but it may lead to different constructions.\n As for the products of thought - using science as an example - there's certainly often some subjectivity there, simply because no scientific theory is ever proclaimed to be an absolute fact (or if it is, whoever does the proclaiming is wrong!). Observations can be objective, but our inferences drawn from observations are subjective.\n Because this appears to conflict with my opening statements, let me clarify: in that situation, I was talking about scientific observations (to contrast with moral observations). It's an objective fact that I see a ball 'fall' when it is dropped - but it can certainly be argued that the conclusions I draw from that observation are subjective, even if I use the scientific method - for example, do I use Newtonian theories of gravitation or Einsteins? The philosophy of science is a fascinating field.\n \n \nBecause morals should be based only on something all human beings have in common.\nSurely the fact that people currently have different morals implies that this isn't the case? Alternatively, it suggests that all human beings have nothing in common, but that's a different line of thought. Morals are what we make them.\n \n \nThe standard of good and evil is the integrated non-contradictory freedom of all humanity, that is an axiom I rest my philosophy on it has no support, let it be noted at this time that a non-contradictory philosophy can be constructed that says morality doesn't exist and you may do anything you want : xkill:\n \n I believe my standard is the only one that allows for society to exist.\nAgain, the fact that society exists and does not have a absolute morality system contradicts this.\n \n \nMurder is objective, I define it as the killing of an innocent human being. That is also how it is used in common speech\n\n It's worth having a look at the rephrasing of my logic that I talked about in later posts, because my use of the phrase 'murder is subjective' was woefully inadequate. To rephrase:\n \n The sentence \"Murder is objectively immoral\" can be split up into two parts - \"murder is immoral\" and (newly improved!) \"the morality of murder is objective\". All I have to do to contradict it, then, is to say that the morality of murder is subjective.\n \n That was my meaning in my original text, but I can see how it was accidentally misinterpreted.",

Current scientific thinking, starting a long time ago and made most famous by Einstein, is that no reference frame is any more 'correct' than any other - just as my moral reference frame is no more 'correct' than yours, despite the fact that they probably differ.\n \n \nboth, the mistake in this case would to believe that was contradictory. \nSo it is possible for you and I to have different, but equally valid, moral views without contradicting the idea of absolute morality?\n \n Just to show my reasoning on that phrase, make it relevant to the current analogy by changing a few words - \"it is possible for Alice and Bob to have different, but equally valid, measurements of time without contradicting the idea of absolute time?\"\n \n \nIf I was in a strong electrical field and someone else was a little farther away it would not be incorrect to say I am subject to a stronger field than him.\n \n You apply subjectivism to the nature of thought, that is where it does not belong.\n \n Subjectivism in this case would be to say \"since we disagree on the strength of the field, the field's shape cannot be known, it's nature cannot be identified objectivly\".\n \n Yet:\n <IMG<http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/c/7/5c71b321b5010e4728587dbe8bd53d86.png</IMG<\n \n You bring up many examples of dynamic situations, yet I claim morality is not dynamic that it is in reference to a constant and I have plenty of examples of that in science as well.\nI'm not sure your understanding of electric fields is quite up to scratch, but I think I get the general point of your argument. However, it's worth bearing in mind that the rules are not always correct - at immense temperatures and tiny distances, such simple rules as Coulomb's (which, incidentally, is the one you should have linked to) break down and stop working - the forces start to unite and spontaneously form odd little pockets - you get magnetic monopoles and all sorts of really odd stuff.\n \n With regards to the bolded - if you have an argument why this should be the case, now would be the time to use it. You could take it as axiomatic, but that doesn't much stand up in a debate.\n \n As for 'dynamic situations', I think you're trying to push the scientific/moral metaphor a bit too far.\n \n \nYou are using subjective in two different senses, one was for thought the other for location.\n \n Time is not subjective as a concept.\nAs a concept? That's also untrue - different people have different concepts of time.\n \n \nNo that it must be wrong if it contradicts itself.\nHence my comment about 'misunderstood concepts'. Schrodingers Cat does not contradict quantum physics.\n \n \nMy point remains cogent, why would someone seek truth if it did not exist?\nFor the pleasure of the hunt? Your point is the strawman - people have their own reasons for doing their own things, and your opinion that their purpose is pointless does not change this.\n \n \nYour subjectivity, not mine \n\n If I claim we are being subjective and you claim we are being objective, my position supports itself, where as yours is self-contradictory.\n \n \nThat morality is not synonymous with legality and that I didn't say it was.\n ...\n That is the purpose of law, to reflect morality.\nI can't help but feel some small contradiction here.\n \n With regards to the latter statement, I would disagree. The purpose of law is to maximise the quality of life of the populace. Sometimes people use morals as the methods by which they choose law, but this is not always the case.\n \n \nReason does not operate of perspectives but knowledge. Your inability to conceptualize knowledge is not my responsibility.\n\n If your claim is that I cannot conceptualise knowledge, then it your absolute responsibility to prove that this is the case. Yours is the burden of proof.\n \n \nI am arguing you should discover objective morality, I already have.\nWhat form does your objective morality take? On what basis do you know that it is objective? Every time I have asked you this you have so far evaded the question.",

   "An axiom you accept. By pretending as if it is not just a fact but the standard of all facts you have proved that your mystical approach to knowledge is impervious to all reason.\nA fact is something that is provable within the realm of though that it involves. You have scientific facts which are proven by the scientific method (induction), mathematical facts which are proven by the rules of logic and philosophical facts which are proven by the various rules of philosophy (more hand-wavy here because there are so many different philosophical schools of thought).\n \n Pragmatically, you have to accept the axiomatic rules that underlie these realms of thought as true - for example, it does not matter in the slightest whether reality 'actually' exists as I perceive it or not, because my perception is all I know*. However, that doesn't mean that you can justify them as being 'absolute' - they're unproven/unprovable axioms, and to call them 'absolute' based on the fact that I accept them is nothing more than an appeal to authority.\n \n ...all this, by the way, is something for another thread, as it's really interesting but quite irrelevant to the point at hand. I'm quite content to sit within/accept the 'pragmatic' argument for absolute morality, if you can provide one (and I cannot argue against it!) - but so far, all you have done is say that AM is axiomatic, which doesn't fit within those boundaries.\n \n *Yes, current scientific breakthroughs might require a reshuffle. Excepting those, however (I'd love to discuss this in another thread!)",
