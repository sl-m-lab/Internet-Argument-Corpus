   "And the meaning of it is movements of some states (USA and Israel) which direct at undermining some processes in the world (Summit G-8). Moreover the movements of those states doesn't limit by diplomacy.\n The fact is that those states are carrying out their policy for getting max profit. And the methods of their influence at the global world's processes are rather terroristic, than political or diplomatic. We could check the line between USA and Israel in their ties with international terrorism (Chechen rebels first of all) which they are using as instrument of pressure at the world community. According to the opinion of the US and Israel, officials of some intractable states will get some 'tests' by organizing at their territories mass disorders (like students' protest actions in Paris last year) and acts of terrorism (the explosions in Madrid and Moscow). By means of provocations, USA and Israel will draw troops (to Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan) under the guise of war against terrorism or democracy establishment on the territories of 'unreliable' countries.\n Unfortunately the epoch of information wars ended and the epoch of dirty provocation and disinformation is beginning. Americans understood that technology of information war is exhausting all its resources and 21 century is the century of civil war and conflicts organizing.",
