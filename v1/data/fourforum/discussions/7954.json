   "Are you being serious? It's hard to tell.\n \n There's a lot of flaws in your argument that I could point out, but your main point seems to be that you want schools to teach Christian views. Schools already do that, except in religous studies classes, not science classes. Evolution is a scientific theory and is taught in science classes. Christianity is a religous belief and is therefore taught in Religous classes.\n \n There's no problem with these views being taught the way they are, students are presented with both options and are told to choose whichever one you believe in. The whole \"ID vs Evolution\" debate comes about because some schools start to teach ID in science classes, and Evolution supporters say it's not a science.",

   "A send-up it may be, but wouldn't it be nice if some scientifically literate member would write a locked sticky for this forum explaining that this sort of thing is simply an abuse of the word \"theory\".\n\n How about if a scientifically literate reader provides some good links?\n \n \"Evolution is a Fact and a Theory\" by Laurence Moran\n \n \"Five Major Misconceptions about Evolution\"\n snippet:\n \nCalling the theory of evolution \"only a theory\" is, strictly speaking, true, but the idea it tries to convey is completely wrong. The argument rests on a confusion between what \"theory\" means in informal usage and in a scientific context. A theory, in the scientific sense, is \"a coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena\" [Random House American College Dictionary]. The term does not imply tentativeness or lack of certainty. Generally speaking, scientific theories differ from scientific laws only in that laws can be expressed more tersely. Being a theory implies self-consistency, agreement with observations, and usefulness. (Creationism fails to be a theory mainly because of the last point; it makes few or no specific claims about what we would expect to find, so it can't be used for anything. When it does make falsifiable predictions, they prove to be false.)\n\n \n Common Creationist Claim CA201: Evolution is only a theory. It is not a fact.\n snippet:\n \nIf \"only a theory\" were a real objection, creationists would also be issuing disclaimers complaining about the theory of gravity, atomic theory, the germ theory of disease, and the theory of limits (on which calculus is based). The theory of evolution is no less valid than any of these. Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges (Milgrom 2002). Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact.\n",
