   "http://www.simetrikkitap.com/images/simetrik_kitap_en.jpg\n \n The study named as \"Binary Symmetric Book I\" comprises a series of mathematical analysis investigating whether the Holy Qur'an has a specific numerical order in terms of both the order of surahs and the number of verses. The purpose is to depict the structure of this current Holy Qur'an, namely, to determine the event. It should not be forgotten that, this research is an examination which was performed from the end, therefore, the results which it sets forth, in a way contain data having feedback nature. \n Determinations set forth in this study, composed of consequences which respects the integrity of the Holy Qur'an, and do not ascribe to any subjective references, and which may be achieved as is when handled by any researchers regardless of his/her being a believer or not. In our point of view, the objectivity and accuracy of the results are important rather than they are being liked or disliked. If we return to the foregoing example, the tables provided in the study are as accurate as the indisputable statement of, \"The Holy Qur'an comprises of 114 surahs\". \n \n This study brings the numerical structure of the Holy Qur'an which can not be possibly explained by random generation into public's attention. Its purpose is to state the existence of this extremely sensible regular structure. Apart from this is beyond the scope of this book. The tables set forth in the book reflect concrete realities. Consequently, whether arrangement of Holy Qur'an is to be based on revelation or not, would make any influence in the existence of this numerical order, but only causes a differentiation in its interpretation. Whereas the ones who consider this arrangement is based on revelation ascribe such exceptional order of Holy Qur'an to the Deity God directly, the others are in a position to attribute such exceptionality again to the God indirectly, forwhy it is a fact that such numerical order can not be human made is apparent in all its nakedness. \n \n Binary Symmetric Book 1, is the first volume of the series of 4 books covering the studies in this respect. The following section titles are contained in this current book:\n \n \u0095 Odd and Even Numbers\n \u0095 Surahs of which the number of ayats are greater than sequence number\n \u0095 Surahs of which the number of ayats are smaller than sequence number\n \u0095 Prime Numbers\n \u0095 Sequence Numbers Set and Number of Ayats Set\n \u0095 The numbers which are divided by two and not divided by three\n \u0095 The numbers which are divided by three and not divided by two\n \u0095 The numbers which are neither divisible by two nor by three\n \u0095 The numbers which are divisible by two and three\n \u0095 The numbers which are divisible by two\n \u0095 The numbers which are divisible by three\n \u0095 Sum of the Prime Factors\n \u0095 Perfect Numbers\n \u0095 Abundant Numbers\n \u0095 Deficient Numbers\n \n The consequences arise as a result of every survey is submitted to the attention of the audience as tables covering the entire Holly Qur'an. \n \n When the tables are observed, \"binary symmetric\" structure is immediately encountered. The concept which we give as the title of our study, is the consequence of the mathematical analysis on the Holy Qur'an, whereas, it is also a definition used by Allah, for the book He sent down: \n \n \"Allah has sent down the best Statement as a binary symmetric book. The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver from it. Then their skin and their heart soften to the remembrance of Allah. That is the guidance of Allah. He Guides therewith whom He wills; and whomever Allah sends astray, for him there is no guide.\" \n \n This verse has a substantial purport for the ones who assess the tables as the consequence of the divine decree which are set forth in the \"binary symmetric book I\". Forwhy, the mathematical structure on which the entire arrangement of the Holy Qur'an is based on was presented clearly again in the Holy Qur'an 14 centuries ago. \n \n Binray Symmetric Book",

   "This study brings the numerical structure of the Holy Qur'an which can not be possibly explained by random generation into public's attention.\n\n \n 1. Even and Odd numbers.\n \n The first thing to notice is that the number of surahs with even ayat numbers is not the same as the number with odd ayat numbers. It's very telling that, in a piece of work dedicated to exposing the 'symmetry' of the Quran, nothing is made of this discrepancy.\n \n So, we have 54 with odd ayat numbers and 60 with even ayat numbers.\n \n The next observation is that, of the 54, half have even sequence numbers and half have odd sequence numbers - and amazingly, of the other sixty, half and half also have even/odd sequence numbers!\n \n Well, not all that amazingly. If the 54 are equally distributed between even and odd sequence numbers, then there are an equal number of odd and even sequence numbers remaining, making it inevitable that the 60 would also occupy them equally. So the odds of that pattern occurring by chance can be calculated just by considering the 54 odd-ayat surahs. \n \n It is extremely revealing that, far from recognising this simple mathematical inevitability, the authors claimed the 30/30 distribution of the 60 as 'strengthening their previous evaluation by two times'.\n \n So, imagine there had been just two odd-ayat surahs. What are the possible odd/even sequence number configurations?\n \n Odd/Odd\n Odd/Even <\n Even/Odd <\n Even/Even\n \n As you can see, there is a 50/50 chance of them being equally spread across odd/even sequence numbers purely by accident.\n \n But there are 54 of them - surely that makes it very unlikely?\n \n Actually, no. The most statistically unlikely configurations are there being all odd or all even; there is only a one in eighteen thousand million million chance of either of those two configurations arising randomly. The odds of them being exactly evenly distributed? A little under 11%, or 1 in 9.23\n \n Even more interesting is that the paper contains a quote apparently from within the Quran saying that the book is binary symmetric. Think about that for a moment. All the writer of those words would have to do is ensure that his surah had an either even or odd number of ayats (thus making it 54/60 rather than 55/59 or 53/61), and then swap the order of a couple of surahs (probably no more than two or three; the odds of it being within 2 of equal distribution by chance is an amazing 50%).\n \n Next up, the wonderfully mathematical-sounding homogeneous and non-homogeneous surahs. Here the authors demonstrate their ability to add 27 and 30 twice, and get the same answer both times. Uncanny!\n \n Remember, we've already accounted, statistically, for there being the same number of odd-ayat/even-sequence surahs and odd-ayat/odd-sequence surahs, and noted that this makes it inevitable for the even-ayat surahs to also be equally distributed. Adding the odd/odds and even/evens together will inevitably yield the same result as adding the even/odds and odd/evens. It doesn't matter if there are 27 odd/odds and 27 odd/evens, or 2 odd/odds and 2 odd/evens; so long as there's an equal number of both, there will always be 57 homogeneous and 57 non-homogeneous surahs.\n \n But wait: there's more!\n \n I found this next bit hilarious. They divide the 114 surahs into a 'first half' and 'second half' of the Quran, and observe that there are 28 'homogeneous' surahs in the first half and 29 in the second half - again, without commenting on this lack of symmetry.\n \n Here's the magic, though. Watch carefully:\n \n They point out that not only are there 28 homogeneous surahs in the first 57 and 29 in the second, there are 28 non-homogeneous surahs in the second 57 and 29 in the first! It's like looking in a mirror!\n \n This is outrageously silly. Here's a little experiment for those of you with too much time on your hands: take an equal number of red and blue balls (doesn't matter how many so long as there's the same number of each), mix them up, and divide them into two equal bags. Now, keep repeating that experiment until the number of red balls in one bag doesn't equal the number of blue balls in the other. Call me when you're done, and I'll give you a billion pounds.\n \n Finally, we come to the coup-de-grace. We define two new sets: the set of surahs for which the total of sequence and ayat number is odd, and the set for which the total is even. \n \n The more astute reader will immediately realise this is just another way of defining our 'homogeneous' and 'non-homogeneous' sets.\n \n An even number plus an even number is an even number, and an odd number plus an odd number is also an even number. This is our 'homogeneous' set from before. Likewise, an odd plus an even is odd, and an even plus an odd is also odd: our 'non-homogeneous' set.\n \n So, armed with exactly the same sets as before, what do they do next?\n \n They add up the ayat/sequence totals in the non-homogeneous set, and arrive at 6555. They observe that this is the same as adding up all the sequence numbers, 1-114, which seems like an astounding coincidence.\n \n They then add up the ayat/sequence totals in the homogeonous set, and arrive at 6236 - which by a staggering coincidence is the same as adding up all the ayat numbers.\n \n However, we shouldn't get too excited just yet.\n \n The set of 57 non-homogeneous surahs contains half the sequence numbers and half the ayat numbers. The homogeneous set contains the other halves. Adding all the ayat numbers and all the sequence numbers together (for a total of 12791) is therefore exactly the same as adding the total values of the two sets together; we're adding up all the same numbers, just in different ways.\n \n So if the non-homogeneous set total is the same as the sum of the sequence numbers, by simple subtraction the homogeneous set total must be the same as the sum of the ayat numbers. As before, what they claim as double-evidence is nothing of the sort; we need only consider the odds of finding (or difficulty of contriving) the non-homogeneous set total to be equal to the total of the sequence numbers.\n \n So, would it be a godly task to contrive such congruence?\n \n Well, let's see: The sum of the non-homogeneous set numbers (which are odd ayat/even sequence and even ayat/odd sequence pairs) needs to equal the sum of the numbers 1-114, or 6555.\n \n If we take all the sequence numbers in the set away from both sides, we get:\n \n The sum of odd ayat numbers of even-sequenced surahs, plus even ayat numbers of odd-sequenced surahs, must equal the total of all the other sequence numbers.\n \n Is this particularly difficult to achieve? No.\n \n Imagine an abridged version of the Quran, with eight surahs and an equal number of homogeneous/non-homogeneous surahs:\n \n 1 O\n 2 E\n 3 E < NH\n 4 O < NH\n 5 E < NH\n 6 E \n 7 E < NH\n 8 E\n \n The ayat numbers of surahs 3,4,5 and 7 need to add up to 1+2+6+8 = 17, and we need to do that with one odd number and three even ones. 5, 4, 6 and 2 will do nicely:\n \n 1 O\n 2 E\n 3 4 <\n 4 5 <\n 5 6 <\n 6 E\n 7 2 <\n 8 E\n \n (Incidentally, it is possible to find such a solution for any number of surahs given equal numbers of homogeneous and non-homogeneous surahs. However the proof by induction is quite laborious and I will not reproduce it here unless it is requested. It's important to realise that the creators of the quran would not need such a proof before attempting to find a solution; they simply couldn't fail, even if they didn't know that.) \n \n The other odd and even numbers can be anything we like; anything at all.\n Of course, in the case of the quran, we already have the text, so we can't arbitrarily choose numbers of ayats to fit our pattern. \n \n Or can we?\n \n First, notice that the total number of ayats (6236) is quite close to the sum of the sequence numbers (6555). That makes our job easier: if the lengths of the surahs are initially random to start with, we're likely to end up with about 50% of the total ayats and roughly half the total sequence numbers in our non-homogeneous set: (roughly half of)6236 plus (roughly half of)6555 will, right off the bat, probably equal something quite close to 6555.\n \n If we're really close, all we need to do is add or subtract a few ayats (two at a time, to preserve our homogeneity). Glance through the quran and you'll see ayats of many different lengths; sometimes there are several sentences in one ayat, other times sentences span ayats. It's not proof, but it's not evidence to the contrary either (as well-structured ayat/sentence relationships would be).\n \n If we're too far away to reach our magic total through ayat-juggling, or we want to minimise our interference, we have a better option: reorder the surahs, swapping a non-homogeneous surah at a low sequence number with a homogeneous surah at a high sequence number (or vice versa). This retains the same non-homogeneous ayat total, but increases or decreases the accompanying sequence total, so we can easily fine-tune the grand total to get as close as possible to 6555. We might not even need to modify the number of ayats at all, if we're lucky.\n \n Once we've hit our 6555 target, we're done. We don't have to mess with the other surahs at all.\n \n So is there any evidence of that sort of thing going on?\n \n Gloriously and marvellously, yes:\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surah\n \n \nThe term is often taken to mean a chapter of the Qur'an, which are traditionally ordered in roughly reverse chronological order, with Madinan suras coming first and Makkan ones last for the most part.\n\n \n Roughly reverse chronological order. Madinan first and Makkan last for the most part. Making the chronological order correct would entirely break the 'symmetry' described. It beggars belief that these aberrations in chronological order are not the fingerprints of someone contriving just that symmetry.\n \n I'll look into the rest of the papers later.",

   "Ok, let's look at the second and third papers:\n \n Instead of adding ayat and sequence numbers, here we start to subtract them from one another instead, exposing 'more' symmetry.\n \n There are 48 surahs with ayat < sequence, and 66 with ayat < sequence - and for the third time, no significance is attached to this lack of symmetry.\n \n Of the 48 with A<S, 23 have A-S = odd and 25 have A-S = even. Again, no symmetry. Ah, but, 25 have S = odd, and 23 have S = even. Symmetry! \n \n Of the 66 with A<S, 34 have S-A = odd and 32 have S-A = even. Yet again, no symmetry. Ah, but, 34 have S = even, and 32 have S = odd. Symmetry!\n \n You'll notice that the (A-S = odd) and (S-A = odd) total 57 (23+34), and that the (A-S = even) and (S-A = even) also total 57 (25+32). \n \n We should not be surprised to see those numbers again, because although we are now subtracting rather than adding ayat and sequence numbers, the odd/even result of doing so is unchanged. Odd + odd = even, odd - odd = even, etc etc. All we're looking at here are the same homogeneous/non-homogeneous sets as in the previous section, further split according to whether A<S or A<S.\n \n So, we know (trivially) that there are a total of 57 odd sequence numbers and 57 even sequence numbers. We also know (and have accounted for) there being 57 homogeneous and 57 non-homogeneous surahs. \n \n This means that if, of the surahs with (A<S), 23 have (A-S odd) and 23 have (S even), it is inevitable that, of those with (A<S), 57-23 = 34 will have (S-A odd) and 57-23 = 34 will have (S even).Once again, the authors claim double significance when the result is in fact inevitable.\n \n Also, the number of surahs with A<S could be anything. If there are 'X' of them, and 23 have (A-S odd) and 23 have (S even), then there must be X-23 with (A-S even) and X-23 with (S odd) - those being the only other possibilities.\n \n Once again, the problem of contriving this symmetry is reduced to making just two numbers the same, with the rest arising as a matter of mathematical inevitability.\n \n So, how hard is it to make the number of (A<S, A-S odd) equal to the number of (A < S, S even)?\n \n I'll leave you to think about that while I go get some sleep.

   "Back again!\n \n One perfectly reasonable explanation for this most recent occurrence of symmetry is coincidence; after all, the authors are actively seeking symmetry, and will undoubtedly be able to find it in some form or other; it would be incredible if they could not. This possibility is admitted by the almost 50/50 distribution of (A-S = odd) and (A-S = even), and (S = odd) and (S = even), which are among the most likely configurations to arise by chance.\n \n However, assuming we have to do a little work to achieve our ends, how should we go about it?\n \n Well, recall earlier that we played around with the non-homogeneous surahs to achieve our 6555 total, and that the remaining homogeneous surahs could have any ayat values at all without disrupting our symmetry.\n \n All we need to do is ensure there are as many homogeneous surahs with A<S as there are odd-sequenced surahs with A<S. We don't even need to preserve any particular total number of surahs with A<S: there happen to be 48 but there's no symmetric significance attached to that particular value. All we need to do is swap (probably no more than) a couple of homgeneous surahs around to bring one total or the other in line.\n \n Is there any evidence of this? Well, the supposedly 'later' Makkan surah 'Al-Fatiha', with 7 ayats, is placed first in the Quran (according to Wiki anyway). It is a homogeneous surah with A<S; just the sort of thing we might need to bring the total up to - oh, say, 25. \n \n Again, I should reinforce the point that we can easily accomplish this particular symmetry without ever disturbing the slightly more delicate 6555 total we contrived earlier.\n \n Nor at any point do we actually need the term 'homogeneous', or any modern mathematical formulae, in order to formulate these symmetries. Odd numbers, even numbers, and addition are our tools.\n \n I haven't yet found a transcript of the other pages of this book/article, but based on what I've read so far, the author's agenda is clear: present perfectly straightforward and easily contrived mathematical congruences (making a couple of numbers the same) in as elaborate a fashion as possible in order to impress the mathematically illiterate. The brazen representation of mathematical inevitabilities as additional evidence is unforgivable.\n \n I am not impressed.",

   "Just to prove a point, I set myself a similar task. I generated 114 random numbers, each between 1 and 200, and then manually contrived all the same symmetries as are listed in that publication, simply by modifying the number of ayats in a few of the surah (by no more than 1 or 2 up or down) to create the 57 homogeneous and 57 non-homogeneous surahs and make the sum of the non-homogeneous surahs' ayat and sequence numbers equal 6555, and then by swapping a total of four even sequence/even ayat surahs to make the number of homogeneous surah with A<S the same as the number of odd-sequence surah with A<S.\n \n Sequence No / Ayat Number\n 1 20\n 2 57\n 3 46\n 4 190\n 5 140\n 6 35\n 7 12\n 8 118\n 9 6\n 10 5\n 11 137\n 12 25\n 13 20\n 14 35\n 15 76\n 16 198\n 17 199\n 18 179\n 19 24\n 20 73\n 21 103\n 22 141\n 23 12\n 24 195\n 25 133\n 26 105\n 27 121\n 28 26\n 29 69\n 30 15\n 31 49\n 32 47\n 33 154\n 34 21\n 35 54\n 36 15\n 37 187\n 38 137\n 39 14\n 40 76\n 41 28\n 42 148\n 43 76\n 44 1\n 45 84\n 46 178\n 47 181\n 48 121\n 49 100\n 50 23\n 51 187\n 52 60\n 53 161\n 54 51\n 55 120\n 56 168\n 57 42\n 58 28\n 59 175\n 60 72\n 61 188\n 62 196\n 63 187\n 64 122\n 65 191\n 66 11\n 67 116\n 68 13\n 69 35\n 70 139\n 71 125\n 72 31\n 73 14\n 74 110\n 75 182\n 76 107\n 77 85\n 78 72\n 79 169\n 80 58\n 81 165\n 82 40\n 83 83\n 84 140\n 85 131\n 86 94\n 87 130\n 88 79\n 89 7\n 90 63\n 91 93\n 92 51\n 93 39\n 94 59\n 95 107\n 96 5\n 97 162\n 98 122\n 99 54\n 100 21\n 101 129\n 102 150\n 103 23\n 104 150\n 105 84\n 106 70\n 107 189\n 108 2\n 109 123\n 110 168\n 111 38\n 112 96\n 113 3\n 114 76\n \n The whole process took about an hour, modified the original random numbers by less than 20 of the original 10,000 ayat total (less than 0.2%), and reordered only four of the 114 surahs (less than 4%).",

   "Division of Inheritance\n \n ACCORD&#304;NG TO QUR'AN\n \n assoc. prof. dr. eng. halis aydemir\n \n \n No matter in which language you write the words of 'Qu'ran' and 'error'; when you search in the internet, first examples you see in the sites will be about the ones concerning the claim of error related with the inheritance verses in Qur'an. You will see the explanations with these verses in detail and the criticism of how these verses cannot be applied mathematically with some practical examples as well!\n \n Whether such approach directed to Qu'ran is evil-minded or querier is not related with the essence of the issue; in conclusion there is a challenge pointed out mathematically in such critiques and this condition cannot be ignored.\n \n It is out of question that the inheritance division by God is not appropriate mathematically. God is the creator of humankind and the science of mathematics. Now then, it is impossible that God proposes an imperfect division mathematically. It is possible to find similar expressions in corresponding sites.\n \n Therefore, each so-called error to be found in Qu'ran has been transformed into an argument directing to weaken or confute the truth of its being apocalyptic. The claim concerning the inheritance divisions is one of the the most discussed examples and comes to minds first.\n \n While we're discussing about inheritance divisions during Qu'ran Courses that we carried out in the public meetings in Qu'ran Research Foundation (KURAV) auditoriums, we also evaluated this subject mathematically with contributions of my dear friends. Visual and audial records of this activity is available on the website: kurandersleri.net. Thanks to inspirations from some of our friends saying that the results we acquired are a little bit different, remarkable and original, we find it acceptable to broadcast by publishing a book.\n \n This study has been prepared as a result of such collective approach. Contrary to popular belief, it is not established on the base of interpretation. It has been carried out on the platform where source text has been considered literally and the differences encountered in formal plan have not been ignored.\n \n I believe that the ones considering the inheritance divisions verses subjected to several speculations until now, one more time from the perspective of this book will realize in a little while that they face with a real mathematical miracle rather than a problematic challenge in number.\n \n Download this book from this site:\n \n quraanicstudies com",
