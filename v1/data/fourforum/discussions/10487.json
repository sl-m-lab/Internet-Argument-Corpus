   "This piece doesn't represent Christianity, in general. It represents fundamentalism, at it's worst. Most Christians don't think that homosexuals should be punished. At least pretty much every one I've ever been around.\n\n \n Hm. Let me introduce you to some of Eastern Europe's finest examples of Christianity in action, now spreading itself to the West Coast of the US:\n \n \n From Novosibirsk To Lynnwood\n \n This is a story about an international Christian group calling itself Watchmen on the Walls, which is going to have a conference in Washington state this coming week-end -- they are responsible for anti-gay hate crimes -- including lynching and murder -- in Eastern Europe and the US. Here's extracts from a speech by one of their US spokesmen, Scott Lively:\n \n \n\"There is a war that is going on in the world. There is a war that is waging across the entire face of the globe. It's been waging in the United States for decades, and it's been waging in Europe for decades. It's a war between Christians and homosexuals.\n \n \"This is a war you haven't seen yet. You've only seen a little bit of it, because Russia had been protected against the homosexual movement by the Communists. One of the few good things that the Soviet Union did is that it stopped the sexual revolution from infecting the Russian people. But all across the West, the sexual revolution changed the culture of the nations. The sexual revolution embraces the idea that there should be no limits on sexual conduct.\n \n \"And this is the design of the Devil to destroy civilization, because civilization is based on the natural family. One man and one woman united in marriage bringing children into the world and training them to replace them in the next generation. That's the foundation of civilization and the heart of Christian living.\n \n \"And in the United States where the sexual revolution began, it was the homosexual political movement that designed this strategy to attack Christianity. The homosexual movement teaches sexual freedom, and its first target is the heterosexual people. The homosexual activists stayed hidden but they taught this philosophy through their activists. And out of the philosophy came the principalities and powers that is destroying the West: The pornography industry, the abortion industry, and the destruction of marriage through divorce.\n \n \"These things are the product of a way of thinking. They deny the Truth of God. They deny the design of God for human beings. And their purpose is the change the cultures of the world.\n \n \"Now, the homosexual movement has been winning this war in the United States, and it has been winning this war in Europe. And we're looking at the future collapse of Western civilization. And Watchmen on the Walls is an organization to fight against this collapse. Watchmen On the Walls is an organization of men and women with courage, who will stand on the Truth of God and without compromise demand that the culture will follow the guidance of God. That marriage and family must be held at the highest level.\"\n\n \n Oh, that Christian hatred... violent, malevolent, evil. Makes Phred Phelps look almost benign in comparison. At least he's a Christian who hasn't actually killed anyone for Jesus personally, yet. This motley crew of Bigots for Jesus think nothing of waging Holy War, a jihad of their very own, against gay human beings.",

However, they don't exactly go out of their way to condemn those who exact such penalties in the name of Jesus. What they do is blame homos for bringing vengeance on themselves by flaunting their \"sin\".\n \n Frankly, this is what Christianity has come to represent to me and many other gay people: a war of the righteous against the infidel, the infidel being any homo. Sorry, but I just cannot treat any such religion with any respect. I don't care whether it is Islam or any form of Christianity, including the one I was brought up in. It's offensive.",

   "Survey: conservative evangelicals turning young people away from Christianity\n \n A case in point...\n \n \nA new study by The Barna Group conducted among 16- to 29-year-olds shows that a new generation is more skeptical of and resistant to Christianity than were people of the same age just a decade ago.\n \n ...Half of young churchgoers said they perceive Christianity to be judgmental, hypocritical, and too political. One-third said it was old-fashioned and out of touch with reality.\n \n Interestingly, the study discovered a new image that has steadily grown in prominence over the last decade. Today, the most common perception is that present-day Christianity is \"anti-homosexual.\" Overall, 91% of young non-Christians and 80% of young churchgoers say this phrase describes Christianity. As the research probed this perception, non-Christians and Christians explained that beyond their recognition that Christians oppose homosexuality, they believe that Christians show excessive contempt and unloving attitudes towards gays and lesbians. One of the most frequent criticisms of young Christians was that they believe the church has made homosexuality a \"bigger sin\" than anything else. Moreover, they claim that the church has not helped them apply the biblical teaching on homosexuality to their friendships with gays and lesbians.\n\n \n Well, the Barna Group is not exactly a pro-homosexual lobby -- they are a group of conservative, Christian evangelicals. Yet the notion that Christianity is defined by its homophobia is what they are coming up with. This is how Christians are seen to define themselves, and it can only be because many prominent Christians define themselves this way. Homos are the drum they love to beat on for fundraising.\n \n So let's not hear any more nonsense about how the anti-gay lobby isn't \"real\" Christianity: it is.",

Yes, many of us are angry at Christian fascism and its prejudice against gays, but we don't take violence to the streets the way Christianists do.\n\n \n Meek and mild?\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS_Coalition_to_Unleash_Power\n \n \n......led to the first Stop the Church protest on December 10, 1989 at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York,[17] in which it's estimated 4500 ACT-UP and WHAM! members gathered outside St. Patrick's Cathedral to protest the Church's perceived homophobia, and their opposition to safe sex education and abortion. 111 activists were arrested. [18] Some activists entered the Cathedral, and interrupted Mass (a sin in Catholicism), threw used condoms at the altar (an excommunicable religious sacrilige), chained themselves to the pews, chanted slogans during the mass or lay down in the aisles. As a result of the St. Patrick's Cathedral action, ACT-UP was publicly condemned by Mayor Edward Koch and some media for what they viewed as militancy and disrespect. \n\n \n In spite todays anti-Christian news reporting, it's still clear to any rational thinking person that Christianity has a larger percentage of \"meek-and-mild\" than does the gay community.",

What we can prove is what I have stated. \n\n \n That may be the case as far as your statement concerning mercantalism. But that does not disprove the Christian principles guiding the Crown's behavior. Both can be operative. For example, see this selection regarding the appointed right hand of the Christian God Himself. Just a sliver away from Christ incarnate. A position possessed by the other George, irreverantly burned in effigy by the colonists for his impunity. The following establishes the British monarchy as acting on Christian principles:\n \n ---------\n \n The Supreme Governor of the Church of England is a title held by the British Monarch that signifies her titular leadership over the Church of England.[1] Even though the monarch's authority over the Church of England is not strong, her position is still very relevant to the church and is mostly observed in a symbolic capacity. The Supreme Governor's prerogative to appoint high-ranking members of the church remains in the hands of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom who makes the appointments based on church leaders' advice. The monarch still performs the formal ratification.[2]\n \n History\n \n The title was created for Elizabeth I. Her father, Henry VIII, was responsible for the English church breaking away from the authority of the Roman Catholic Church after the Pope excommunicated Henry in 1533 over his annulment from Catherine of Aragon. By 1536, Henry had broken with Rome, seized the church's assets in England and declared the Church of England as the established church with himself as its head. The Act of Supremacy of 1534 confirmed the King's status as having supremacy over the church and required the nobility to swear an oath recognising Henry's supremacy.[3] Henry's daughter, Queen Mary I, attempted to restore the English Church's allegiance to the Pope and repealed the Act of Supremacy in 1555.[4] Elizabeth took the throne in 1558 and, the next year, Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy of 1559 that restored the original act.[5] However, to placate critics, the Oath of Supremacy nobles were required to swear gave the monarch's title as Supreme Governor of the church rather than Supreme Head. This wording avoided the charge that the monarchy was claiming divinity or usurping Jesus Christ, whom the Bible identifies as head of the church.[6]\n Defender of the Faith has been part of the British monarch's title since Henry VIII was originally granted it by Pope Leo X in 1521 in recognition, ironically enough, of Henry's role in opposing the Protestant Reformation.[7] The pope withdrew the title, but it was later reconferred by Parliament in the reign of Edward VI.\n [edit]Thirty-Nine Articles\n This royal role is acknowledged in the Preface to the Thirty-Nine Articles of 1562. It states that:\n \"Being by God's Ordinance, according to Our just Title, Defender of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church, within these Our Dominions, We hold it most agreeable to this Our Kingly Office, and Our own religious zeal, to conserve and maintain the Church committed to Our Charge, in Unity of true Religion, and in the Bond of Peace ... We have therefore, upon mature Deliberation, and with the Advice of so many of Our Bishops as might conveniently be called together, thought fit to make this Declaration following ... That We are Supreme Governor of the Church of England ... \"\n \n Article 37 makes this claim to royal supremacy more explicit:\n \"The King's majesty hath the chief power in this Realm of England, and other of his Dominions, unto whom the chief Government of all Estates of this Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil, in all causes doth appertain, and is not, nor ought to be, subject to any foreign jurisdiction ... We give not to our Princes the ministering either of God's Word, or of the Sacraments ... but that only prerogative, which we see to have been given always to all Godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God himself; that is, that they should rule all estates and degrees committed to their change by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evildoer ... The Bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this Realm of England.\" [8]\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Governor_of_the_Church_of_England\n \n -----------\n \n \n [QUOTE=obvious_child;288125]\n There is no definitive separation of Church and state in the constitution. And the bill of rights wasn't even going to be included in the first place![QUOTE]\n \n Well, amendments by definition are afterthoughts, are they not? But the separation is, indeed, definitive. Just as the religious basis for the Crown's behavior was plainly declared, even if the original common law preceded Christianity, that more secular body of rules deemed fit enough for adoption by our founders.\n \n But government as right hand of God, or based on Christian principles, was not.",

Your argument doesn't even have anything remotely similar. I cited the 200 years because that's all you gave. You are assuming that in 200 years without any evidence that it still applied and was used as a foundation for legitimate policy. If you had supplied a document showing that the Crown specifically or even casually said that the colonial policies were religion inspired or related you'd have a argument. You didn't do. Mere existence does not make you right. I could argue against this by citing European religious treaties without citing how they were actually applied.\n \n You don't have evidence of this. Again, I'm not saying you're wrong, you just need better evidence. \n \n \nRead the passages again. It has nothing to do with what I say it did; it has to do with what the Crown said it did.\n\n \n Read above. You need contemporary evidence that it was even in force or considered to be relevant. I already gave you examples of what this would look like. \n \n \nYour proof was provided.\n\n \n No it wasn't. You are arguing that a 200+ year old creed still applied and was the basis for their policy on the colonies. You did not provide any evidence that it actually WAS relevant or used.\n \n Again, I'm not saying you're wrong, but you need better evidence. \n \n \nIf you read the passages, they state that the Crown was the head of the Church, and, that the Crown cites the Christian God for whatever they do.\n\n \n Under that logic, the Communists in China are legitimate because of the Mandate of Heaven emoticon_xbye . Explain to me how a document that is over two centuries prior to the acts of a state are as you said, proof of your claim. \n \n \nThis was the bottom line, OC. The Crown therefore acted on Christian principles.\n\n \n If you want to argue that a document written 200 years ago is a indicator of actual policy without providing any evidence that it was still considered relevant in that society sure. \n \n To provide a example of how absurd your claims are, the US had on its laws that only white land owners could get married. Under your argument, which relies upon assuming that older documents are still relevant without providing evidence that they actually are, the true meaning of our marriage laws in the US are actually based on a serious form of racism and all non-white land owning marriages are just shams. Anyone could easily tear that argument apart by simply asking for evidence that such a law is still relevant or applicable. As I have no evidence for this, I would have to admit it was wrong. Thus this examples leaves you with two choices: Either admit your argument is invalid based on lack of evidence or GO FIND SOME CONTEMPORARY EVIDENCE THAT PROVES YOUR CLAIM!\n \n \n You could believe that your argument is sound...\n \n But you'd be a idiot and laughed out of all credible and respectable historical societies. \n \n I'm not asking much. Just for you to provide a document showing that such a creed was still relevant or that it was cited in Crown Colonial policy.\n \n Well, there is a third option. But it is far harder then finding just simple documented evidence. You'd have to compare the policies and their justifications on Christian principles or at least what was Christanity's principles back then.

I don't allow myself to simply toss out anything I don't like, as many theistic evolutionists seem to do, but I apply it to myself, or to the political process, without advocation of breaking any U.S. laws. So there's really no need for you innocent lil atheists to be terrified of myself or EZ.\n\n \n If Jesus used a wide range of literary techniques to convey his message, how are you certain that other parts of the Bible are not God using the same techniques to impart his message within a whole picture or context? \n \n I don't think anyone here fears you Marc. I can't say as I care to associate with or have those who choose to ignore reality in favour of fantasy, or who act irrationally, illogically, and paranoid, in control of aspects of my life that require the opposite of such attributes, but other than that, you're free to do whatever it is that you do, I could really care less. \n \n \nBy the way, could you tell me which U.S. states still allow slavery? :p\n\n \n I thought you understood literary techniques such as analogy? I might have to question your ability to read the Bible if you continue to show such lacking reading and comprehension skills as you've demonstrated in this response.\n \n Waxy",

   "Here you go, OC, \"evidence that it was relevant or used\":\n \n From John Adams, The Meaning of the American Revolution, [A letter to H. Niles, 13 February 1818]\n \n and nation of Great Britain as determined to new-model the colonies from the foundation, to annul all their charters, to constitute them all royal governments, toraise a revenue in America by parliamentary taxation, to apply that revenue to pay the salaries of governors, judges, and all other crown officers; and, after all this, to raise as large a revenue as they pleased, to be applied to national purposes at the exchequer in England; and further, to establish bishops and the whole system of the Church of England, tithes and all, throughout all British America. This system, he said, if it was suffered to prevail, would extinguish the flame of liberty all over the world; that America would be employed as an engine to batter down all the miserable remains of liberty in Great Britain and Ireland, where only any semblance of it was left in the world. \n \n http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/adams_john_american_revolution.html\n\n \n Better but not up to par. The problem with this source (aside not being a Crown source actually citing religion) is that it prioritizes non-religious issues as the key reasons. It states after all this meaning once the policies that the Colonies revolted under were in place and consolidated that the Anglican Church would be established. You'd have a decent argument if the entire point of the colonial mercantilist policy was to enact the Anglican Church. That is clearly not the point of the article you provided. The establishment of the Church is almost after thought and that the primary and key reasons for the Colonial Polices were not religious based. the major reasons your article provides are for governmental control, not because Jesus -told-me-so.\n \n You're still at the three way intersection. The surest way you can prove that Colonial Policy was religious based is to find a Crown document on these policies stating so directly or even indirectly. \n \n You need a primary source document from the UK archives.\n \n Again, I'm not saying you're right or you are wrong as I understand just how hard it would be to prove either.",

   "That bolded segment doesn't bother you at all? You don't see any problems with that? \n\n \n Not in the slightest, as long as the interpreter is applying it to his/her own behavior, or applying it to politics in lawful ways. The application is equal with atheism - it can be interpreted in an unlimited number of ways. The three atheist regimes of Stalin, Hitler and Mao were responsible for over 100 million murders. Like you, those people paid little attention to the Bible. That doesn't bother you at all?\n \n \nI didn't imply anything of the sort in my post (as O_C pointed out). You're making XXXumptions, as per usual. \n\n \n And exactly like obvious child, you completely missed my reference to post #35. It was a previous post where you used my name, remember? You said this;\n \n \nI'm pretty sure that EZ, Marc9000, and others don't consider any part of the Bible to be obsolete. \n\n \n That is where you implied it, in post #35. T-H-I-R-T-Y F-I-V-E. Do you see it now? \n \n \n \nPlease explain to me how this statement was construed to mean that one must be either -\n \n A - 100% Literalist\n \n B - A theistic evolutionist that \"hates\" literalists, or more simply an \"atheist\" \n \n \n In was in post THIRTY FIVE. You implied that because I don't agree with everything science tells me, or everything liberal politicians tell me, that I must not believe anything in the Bible is obsolete, including things like stoning people for their sins, plucking out eyes, etc. What you said in post THIRTY FIVE harmonizes with most all of your drive by posts here, that if one is not a crazed, 100% literalist, then one automatically lets nothing but godless science determine all political decisions. \n \n \n \nThat statement is as open ended as is possible regarding the issue. \n\n \n Not when it's combined with what you said in post #THIRTY FIVE. \n \n \n\"Blending your beliefs with reality\" has no specific meaning and covers any and all manners in which one chooses to interpret the Bible and incorporate it into the reality of the world around them. \n\n \n I know - it's your style of posting. If it has \"no specific meaning\" then why did you say it? The reason is simple, it has an IMPLIED meaning, and that's why you used it. The more reality a person realizes is directly proportional to how much science he/she has studied. If he/she has studied enough science, complete reality would finally set in - THERE IS NO GOD!! Some young people who read here are fooled by your cleverness, and some are not. \n \n \nQuite simple Marc, the world is not the black and white microcosm that you chose to project onto my statement, and seemingly onto everything and everyone else around you that doesn't fit into your definition of Christianity (despite your own assertion in this very post which I highlighted for you). \n\n \n The world might not be, but politics in the U.S. often is. \n \n \nFurthermore the use of the word \"hate\" is assinine. I don't hate you, and I don't hate literalists. I certainly don't do anything as far as you or any other literalist is concerned \"with a passion\". \n\n \n Except post, harmonize, and have love fests with those who do show pretty much hate in their posts? Re-read the ringside forum posts from last March if you need your memory freshened. Seems like the several civilized discussions I've had with non believers who obviously don't hate me don't find you around as much. \n \n \nI know you, Marc9000, would never use your personal beliefs to justify a public action. emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_rolleyes \n\n \n Not if that public action broke the law, no. \n \n \nIf Jesus used a wide range of literary techniques to convey his message, how are you certain that other parts of the Bible are not God using the same techniques to impart his message within a whole picture or context? \n\n \n It has to be sorted out through Bible study, and observation of the world. Not just scientific observation, but human behavioral observations, and others. Different Christians have different views of it, and don't condemn each other for it. But they can recognize when someone strays too far from the basics - the nature of God / the personality of God, as Christ taught it. When they agree politically with atheists in every way, a red flag can go up. \n \n \n \nI don't think anyone here fears you Marc. I can't say as I care to associate with or have those who choose to ignore reality in favour of fantasy, or who act irrationally, illogically, and paranoid, in control of aspects of my life that require the opposite of such attributes, but other than that, you're free to do whatever it is that you do, I could really care less. \n\n \n \n \"Fear\" has been expressed in this thread, not towards me personally, but to Christianity in general. I know that you don't consider that \"paranoia\",you consider any written Christian response to it \"paranoia\". Many atheists claim that religion is destroying America, as they attempt to get rid of 10 Commandments displays, and remove a reference to God off our money. That's not paranoia!! Yet when many Christians wonder why twenty different magazines lined up on the rack at the local food store have front pages splashed with the drinking binges of the latest popular Hollywood slut - they're paranoid!! \n \n I think the best example of paranoia at these forums is how so many posters here answer for each other. You'll notice obvious child responded to my post to you, long before you did. I noticed you sometimes respond to my posts to others. I've had as many as 10 people jump into a one on one discussion I was having at least once. Archangel has had twenty. What do you think the chances are that obvious child will respond to this post to you, before you have a chance to, complete with plenty of bold type, caps and italics? \n \n How about last March in the ringside forum, when you were clammoring for the judges to hurry up, when you and several of your friends were personally insulting me as I was involved in a structured debate? Can you link me to any time when agitatied Christians have said one word about the opinions of atheist posters in formal debates?\n \n You've referred to EZ a couple of times in this thread. As far as I know, he hasn't posted to speak of in several months! Are you paranoid? \n \n You and I could probably have a formal debate about paranoia. But as you've said, as a drive-by coffee break poster, you don't have the time. You can make any claim you want, and don't have to worry about backing it up. Obvious child and several others have all the time in the world to back you up while you're busy. \n \n \n \nI thought you understood literary techniques such as analogy? \n\n \n Not in this case, everything was true in jyoshu's analogy, and something was not true in yours. Looked like one of your usual attempts to frustrate, as you did to me in the ABOR thread. \n \n \n I might have to question your ability to read the Bible if you continue to show such lacking reading and comprehension skills as you've demonstrated in this response.\n \n Waxy\n\n \n You shouldn't be so paranoid of my ability to read the Bible.

Instead of just minding their own business they have to try and impose their views upon the rest of us. An example are these new abominal health and human services ads. The ads depict children asking their parents to ask them to wait to get married to have sex. I find these ads very offensive, for they assumes all preteens and young teens are hetero.

Look, it says what it says. It may be that the amendment has been applied in cases farther than what it clearly specifies, but that doesn't mean it's a correct interpretation. I think the amendment has, over time, come to be distorted in terms of interpretation. It's my opinion that we've become rather 'religiophobic' in terms of church and state, probably a lot more so than things were at the time the constitution was written. (Or for that matter, even 50 or 60 years ago.) These cases of religion being stripped from govt. buildings and prayer from schools are a relatively recent phenomenon in the scope of U.S. history. It clearly says that \"congress shall pass no law\", and it's just not rational to assume it was intended to say anything more than that, given that it was so specific. There's no ambiguity there. To take what it says and claim that it means much more and applies to all areas and actions of govt. is to make it say something it does not. IMO it's a case of a quite specific amendment being used to justify doing things considerably more restrictive than it specifies.\n \n Those who liberally interpret the constitution should be consistent and take the same tact with this amendment they do so often with the 2nd amendment: that we should simply go by what it says. It's interesting that many of the same people who would say the 2nd amendment as freedom to own and carry guns really only applies to the case of \"a well-regulated militia\" (after all, that's what it says), don't seem to be nearly as interested in following the constitution more specifically in terms of what it clearly says when it comes to the 1st amendment.",

I am happy to plead guilty to such hostility for a number of reasons, not least being religious homophobia, though that is not the only one.

   "Not in the slightest, as long as the interpreter is applying it to his/her own behavior, or applying it to politics in lawful ways. The application is equal with atheism - it can be interpreted in an unlimited number of ways. The three atheist regimes of Stalin, Hitler and Mao were responsible for over 100 million murders. Like you, those people paid little attention to the Bible. That doesn't bother you at all?\n\n \n Whether or not Hitler's regime was \"atheist\" by the actual definition of the word is readily debateable. At any rate, it's rather irrelevent. None of these regimes acted in the \"name of atheism\". I don't like or condone the actions of any of them, regardless of purported justifications.\n \n Furthermore, atheism makes no claims beyond simply that God doesn't exist. That really isn't open to interpretation.\n \n \nAnd exactly like obvious child, you completely missed my reference to post #35. It was a previous post where you used my name, remember? You said this;\n \n That is where you implied it, in post #35. T-H-I-R-T-Y F-I-V-E. Do you see it now? \n \n In was in post THIRTY FIVE. You implied that because I don't agree with everything science tells me, or everything liberal politicians tell me, that I must not believe anything in the Bible is obsolete, including things like stoning people for their sins, plucking out eyes, etc. What you said in post THIRTY FIVE harmonizes with most all of your drive by posts here, that if one is not a crazed, 100% literalist, then one automatically lets nothing but godless science determine all political decisions. \n \n Not when it's combined with what you said in post #THIRTY FIVE. \n\n \n LOL. This is downright comical Marc. You're basing assumptions on inferences. :p\n \n Actually read what I said in POST 35 -\n \n \nI'm pretty sure that EZ, Marc9000, and others don't consider any part of the Bible to be obsolete. \n\n \n Your rantings on the subject simply are not supported by this statement. Nor are your further assumptions.\n \n It's very straight forward, and doesn't \"imply\" anything beyond what's stated. It simply states that to the best of my knowledge, you don't consider any part of the Bible obsolete. As it turns out, and only now have you stated so, you do consider a few specific portions obsolete, based on your own choosing.\n \n It certainly doesn't imply \"that if one is not a crazed, 100% literalist, then one automatically lets nothing but godless science determine all political decisions\". That's your own martyr complex and personal bias shining through.\n \n \nI know - it's your style of posting. If it has \"no specific meaning\" then why did you say it? The reason is simple, it has an IMPLIED meaning, and that's why you used it. The more reality a person realizes is directly proportional to how much science he/she has studied. If he/she has studied enough science, complete reality would finally set in - THERE IS NO GOD!! Some young people who read here are fooled by your cleverness, and some are not. \n\n \n LOL. Nice try.\n \n The phrase \"Blending your beliefs with reality\" has no specific meaning as in defining how and to what extent those personal religious beliefs are blended with the reality of the world around you. It was intentionally left open ended, as the extent to which personal religious beliefs and reality are incorporated is very broad - from the 100% literalist to the casual Catholic, and I deliberately wanted to avoid being specific on such a non-specific topic. \n \n That's plain as day for any and all to see, and needs no further defense from me.\n \n \nThe world might not be, but politics in the U.S. often is. \n\n \n Only to those who choose to see it that way.\n \n \nExcept post, harmonize, and have love fests with those who do show pretty much hate in their posts? Re-read the ringside forum posts from last March if you need your memory freshened. Seems like the several civilized discussions I've had with non believers who obviously don't hate me don't find you around as much. \n\n \n Guilt by association?\n \n Being critical of you, disagreeing with you, or even thinking you're a fool, doesn't mean that I hate you, or that anyone here hates you.\n \n Me not being around in your formal debates, or involved in every subject you post on, could not be more irrelevent.\n \n \nNot if that public action broke the law, no. \n\n \n Nice wiggle Marc, but no dice.\n \n Here is what you originally posted, and what I responed to -\n \n \nThe problem always starts when a particular belief (or no belief) is used to justify a public action. \n\n \n Where does breaking the law enter into that statement of yours?\n \n Ohhh, that's right, it doesn't. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nIt has to be sorted out through Bible study, and observation of the world. Not just scientific observation, but human behavioral observations, and others.\n \n \n Fair enough, but how does one know when they've got it right?\n \n Different Christians have different views of it, and don't condemn each other for it. But they can recognize when someone strays too far from the basics - the nature of God / the personality of God, as Christ taught it. When they agree politically with atheists in every way, a red flag can go up. [/QUOTE]\n \n REALLY? I know I could go through the religion forum here and come up with a multitude of examples of Christians condemning other Christians for their beliefs. You yourself have condemned all other Christians who don't share your beliefs on evolution.\n \n This whole paragraph reeks of you judging/condemning other Christians. Talk about hypocrisy.\n \n \n\"Fear\" has been expressed in this thread, not towards me personally, but to Christianity in general. I know that you don't consider that \"paranoia\",you consider any written Christian response to it \"paranoia\". Many atheists claim that religion is destroying America, as they attempt to get rid of 10 Commandments displays, and remove a reference to God off our money. That's not paranoia!! Yet when many Christians wonder why twenty different magazines lined up on the rack at the local food store have front pages splashed with the drinking binges of the latest popular Hollywood slut - they're paranoid!! \n\n \n The 10 Commandments stuff is not paranoia, that's people having too much time on their hands and too little common sense. Unfortunately, the world has too many extremists.\n \n As for the tabloids, that's straight outta left field, I'm not sure what kinda response to give that, other than, I would bet, dollars to donuts, that the primary demographic of those magazines is Christian women - women being the primary demographic, the majority of women in the USA being Christian.\n \n \nI think the best example of paranoia at these forums is how so many posters here answer for each other. You'll notice obvious child responded to my post to you, long before you did. I noticed you sometimes respond to my posts to others. I've had as many as 10 people jump into a one on one discussion I was having at least once. Archangel has had twenty. What do you think the chances are that obvious child will respond to this post to you, before you have a chance to, complete with plenty of bold type, caps and italics? \n\n \n Unreal.\n \n It's a public debate forum. People post and respond to topics that interest them. If you desire to debate with only a single other poster, then take it to the PMs or another medium, it's that simple.\n \n The number of posters responding to one side of a topic is simply a reflection of the number of people that hold those beliefs. The fact that you often find yourself alone is not a reflection of the other's paranoia, it's a reflection of the fact that you hold singular or unique beliefs. \n \n To construe it to mean anything beyond that truly is paranoia.\n \n \nHow about last March in the ringside forum, when you were clammoring for the judges to hurry up, when you and several of your friends were personally insulting me as I was involved in a structured debate? Can you link me to any time when agitatied Christians have said one word about the opinions of atheist posters in formal debates?\n\n \n Nope.\n \n \nYou've referred to EZ a couple of times in this thread. As far as I know, he hasn't posted to speak of in several months! Are you paranoid? \n\n \n LOL. Not in the least. EZ just happens to be the perfect example of an extremist.\n \n Would it be paranoid to continually reference Tom Brady when speaking of superb quarterbacks?\n \n Your assertion is rather foolish. If it was an attempt to attack me personally, it failed miserably.\n \n \nYou and I could probably have a formal debate about paranoia. But as you've said, as a drive-by coffee break poster, you don't have the time. You can make any claim you want, and don't have to worry about backing it up. Obvious child and several others have all the time in the world to back you up while you're busy. \n\n \n A formal debate about paranoia?\n \n I do back it up. Simply because I don't have the time to engage in a formal debate with you on every topic we cross paths on is rather irrelevent.\n \n I don't control what O_C and others do. Has it ever occurred to you that they post to back up their own beliefs, and that those beliefs simply conincide with the my general beliefs?\n \n \nNot in this case, everything was true in jyoshu's analogy, and something was not true in yours. Looked like one of your usual attempts to frustrate, as you did to me in the ABOR thread. \n\n \n I'm not even sure why I'm responding to this, perhaps it's a compulsive need, perhaps it's because the objection is so childish.\n \n \"Slavery\" is completely irrelevent to the analogy. We could have been talking about \"nose picking\" for all that it matters. Simply plug \"nose picking\" in to the place of slavery, and the point remains.\n \n Jyoshu understood the analogy, why are you unable? \n \n \nYou shouldn't be so paranoid of my ability to read the Bible. Don't take yourself so seriously, you'll live longer.\n\n \n Paranoia or pity?\n \n At any rate, I take it you were trying for a little shot at me or some humour here at the end.

   "I do not think this is remotely true.\n\n \n Then you don't have a very good handle on history as a whole. The reason early documents had references to God was that there wasn't the religiophobia back then that there is now. You only need to ask yourself if \"endowed by the Creator\" would have been included nowadays, or if \"in God we trust\" would have been etched in our currency now, as opposed to earlier in the 20th century. I think it's clear it would not be, because we've become much more religiophobic. Which is sad, really. The founders like Jefferson and Franklin, who weren't Christian, respected their Christian colleagues. That Christians, deists, and even agnostics were able to come together out of respect and form the Union is indicative of how much things have changed. People who are hostile toward religion sometimes invoke people like Jefferson, but Jefferson was not hostile toward religion. He was respectful of those around him who were religious, and that is contrast to those who invoke him today who ARE hostile toward religion. \n \n And before you assume I'm only talking about respect toward Christians, I think it goes both ways. I think we can also assume that Christians were probably more respectful then too, than they are today. Religious people back then, IMO, were more libertarian in the way they viewed public policy. They had more of a 'it's-not-my-business' approach to morals in society. I would like to see Christianity return to this way of thinking more, and consider morality more of a personal matter.\n \n \nBut state neutrality towards religion should never be interpreted, as you do here, as hostility, nor should it ever turn into hostility. Just a hands-off approach.\n\n \n No, the way it should be interpreted is whether or not it's constitutional. And going any farther than preventing Congress making laws respecting religion clearly isn't.",

I understand why you can't figure this out. In a nutshell, the Church exists to support the Crown. To give legitimate reason to taxation and tithe that support the secular endevours of the Crown. You're under the false impression that the two are different and that the Crown is sub servant to the Church. The Crown uses the Church to increase its own power, it uses religion as a tool for consolidation of power. Your argument that the Crown's polices come from religion is just ignorant of Anglican Church - Crown Relations.

   "DUDE. Read your articles before posting them. \n\n \n Oh, are you now claiming that the John Adams letter wasn't written to Hezekiah Niles?\n \n \n Find me a document from the Crown. You're encountering another problem here. All your evidence is from one side, the side being attacked. You're trying to prove that the Crown was acting on Christian Principles. Therefore it would be far more useful to find a Crown document showing this instead of one that is from the opposing side. \n\n \n You were provided a document from the Crown earlier, claiming their dominion over the Church of England, and asserting that ALL their actions were condoned by the Christian God. I think, what you're really saying, is that you only accept the word of any dictatorial regime as to what they were REALLY doing. C'mon. That's not rational, unless you're a Tory.\n \n My sense is that main problem, for you, if you'd only be more honest, is the defining of Christian principles. \n \n Well, sure, you can argue that Christian principles are defined in terms of any number of given sets of ethical conduct (or not). And you can throw that around forever. But the plain fact is that, acting on the basis of a Christian Church, like the Church of England, trying to impose that church on others, IS acting on the basis of those Christian principles, particularly when one (like, the Crown) is the HEAD of that church. Those principles are not divorced from their administration. Maybe they're not someone's else Christian church or someone else's Christian principles, but they sure as heck were the Crown's -- not matter how loudly you stamp your foot and say, \"But where do they say, and at the time of the Revolution itself, that's what they meant?\" Well, dear, you show me where they threw out that document that was still effective during George's reign. (or said: \"AMENDMENT __ CHRISTIAN GOD ALWAYS ON OUR SIDE WITH CROWN AS RIGHT HAND -- EXCEPT IN PRESENT WAR WITH BLOODY COLONISTS -- DATED etc) Now the onus is on you. Run and do your homework. Get some proof. Or show me that there's only one set of Christian principles owned by YOUR god, and the Crown was not acting in accordance thereof.\n \n \n You're taking one paragraph from a document that covers a very large number of reasons why the revolution occurred and saying it was the basis for policy at the same time ignoring how all of the reasons tie back to one: Parliament dominating authority over the Colonies, largely related to economics. \n\n \n Don't you get it? Parliment moving in meant the Church of England was coming, and THAT was what was critically important to the colonists in creating an American Revolution.\n \n Deal. Economics and Christian Principles can walk hand in hand.\n The world is not all about your neat little formulae.",

   "Oh, are you now claiming that the John Adams letter wasn't written to Hezekiah Niles?\n\n \n Do you have a learning disability that causes you to improperly read everything given to you? \n \n That is not what I said. \n \n \nYou were provided a document from the Crown earlier, claiming their dominion over the Church of England, and asserting that ALL their actions were condoned by the Christian God\n\n \n No you didn't. All you have provided is colonist views of it. Not Crown. What you gave before is the history, over 200 years prior. I haven't seen a contemporary document showing that Crown Colonial policy was indeed religious based. You first asserted that a document 200 years prior to the revolution was relevant. You then completely failed to do this. You then moved on to providing colonist documents which gave a large number of reasons that were secular, power and economic based with only marginal hints at religion and much of it as a afterthought once the Crown had established control of the Colonial government. \n \n \nI think, what you're really saying, is that you only accept the word of any dictatorial regime as to what they were REALLY doing. C'mon. That's not rational, unless you're a Tory.\n\n \n Where Crown I meant British. And to think that All of the British were for the war is kind of insane. And you haven't even provided a single document from the Crown from that time period. \n \n \nMy sense is that main problem, for you, if you'd only be more honest, is the defining of Christian principles.\n\n \n I already gave you that option a while back, to compare Christian Principles to Crown policy. Saying I'm not honest when I said \"Well, there is a third option. But it is far harder then finding just simple documented evidence. You'd have to compare the policies and their justifications on Christian principles or at least what was Christanity's principles back then.\"\n \n That was post #64. How can I be more honest when I did exactly what you said I should be doing? \n \n \nWell, sure, you can argue that Christian principles are defined in terms of any number of given sets of ethical conduct (or not). And you can throw that around forever.\n\n \n No, you define them by scripture. I do believe that is how most of the pro-Christians here do that to defend or prove their Christian claims. \n \n \nBut the plain fact is that, acting on the basis of a Christian Church, like the Church of England, trying to impose that church on others, IS acting on the basis of those Christian principles, particularly when one (like, the Crown) is the HEAD of that church\n\n \n So Christian principles are anything that the head of the Church does? So the British Kings hacking off the heads of their wives is a Christian principle? Are you actually going to defend that? Furthermore, of the areas that were taken by the British in the war, the Anglican Church wasn't enacted in the captured territories. The only suggestion of that comes from the letters, which present the argument as a after thought after the Crown had seized legislative control. So all you actually have is speculation if they'd impose the Church. \n \n \nThose principles are not divorced from their administration. Maybe they're not someone's else Christian church or someone else's Christian principles, but they sure as heck were the Crown's\n\n \n This argument is now pointless as Christian principles meant whatever anyone wants them to me. Sure you win, but you win a meritless argument based on a completely subjective view of what is in contention. When one is free to define words and phrases to whatever they so wish, there is absolutely no use for actual language. But you still have a problem proving that they were indeed the Crown's. \n \n \nnot matter how loudly you stamp your foot and say, \"But where do they say, and at the time of the Revolution itself, that's what they meant?\" Well, dear, you show me where they threw out that document that was still effective during George's reign.\n\n \n I'm not the one trying to prove that they did or did not. I'm just pointing out that your argument has several holes the size of the sun. Granted, not as large as Arcturus, which Arch's arguments tend to have many the size of, but you still have problems. \n \n I'm still sticking to my original statement that \"I don't know\" if they were or were not as proving either side is likely to require access to British Archives and a whole lot of time spent looking. I don't care that much (or frankly at all). I'm just saying that you need better evidence, and evidence that is from that country.\n \n \nNow the onus is on you. Run and do your homework. Get some proof. Or show me that there's only one set of Christian principles owned by YOUR god, and the Crown was not acting in accordance thereof.\n\n \n Well that might be hard as I'm not taking a position that they did or didn't. And having a religion that doesn't hold Christian principles also puts a wrench in your proposal. I'm not a Christian.\n \n \nDon't you get it? Parliment moving in meant the Church of England was coming, and THAT was what was critically important to the colonists in creating an American Revolution.\n\n \n No, it was a secondary threat. The big threat, the primary threat was loss of autonomy in government. Plus both the colonists and the Crown were Christians. It's not like they were another religion going to force everyone to believe something else. And much of the threat of the Anglican Church stems more from its ability to take land and wealth from the colonists (as it had done in England to the people living there) and transfer it to the Crown. It's not about whether or not the principles of the religion were a threat, it was the economic one.\n \n \nDeal. Economics and Christian Principles can walk hand in hand.\n The world is not all about your neat little formulae.\n\n \n I take it you have spent more time in weak forums that don't question your line of reasoning eh?\n \n You're going to have to prove that economics and christian principles walk hand in hand and that they did it there. i seem to remember that Christ said something about a needle and a rich man.",

   " Yes, atheists using the word \"reality\" when discussing religion certainly is open ended. emoticon_rolleyes \n\n \n It most certainly is.\n \n Religion and spirituality is a blend of the natural world (reality) and the supernatural world.\n \n It really is impossible not to blend the two in some way, regardless of the particular religion.\n \n \nMost people see it that way, if they're familiar with voting of Republicans vs. Democrats. \n\n \n I disagree. IMHO, for most, it's a matter of the lesser of two evils when it comes to voitng. \n \n From what I've seen, other than on peripheral issues meant to inflame and divide, there is no difference between between Republicans and Democrats, when it comes down to the issues that truly affect Americans - the economy being #1.\n \n \nLanguage has been known to get stronger than what we are having here. Check out this post, just a few down from the above referenced one. You remember T.Q. - you were harmonizing with him perfectly in ringside back in March. (make sure to read all that, especially about 2/3 of the way down.)\n\n \n I read it all, plenty of personal attacks, no mention of hating you though. Much of it was in response to your own personal attacks and disparaging comments.\n \n Guilty as charged for sharing the same opinions as T.Q. when it comes to your posts on the subject.\n \n This seems to be a real sore spot for you - either you've had your feelings hurt or you feel that this gives you some real moral high ground on which to preach from. Either way, it's getting really old.\n \n \nI thought it was understood, since the subject a post or two above was about stoning gay people, but apparently not. \" ......to justify a public action that breaks the law.\" I'll try to be more thorough next time. \n\n \n Please do. Otherwise one is left to assume and imply your meaning...\n \n \nWell you may be confusing \"condemning\" with \"discussing\". But in many, possibly most cases, it's because one believed the other strayed too far from the basics. \n\n \n Nope. No confusion. It's condeming. It's VERY straightforward, especially regarding issues of homosexuality and \"evolution\".\n \n \nSo atheists taking a liberal, godless stance is \"having too much time on their hands\", and Christians taking a traditional conservative stance is paranoia? I see. \n\n \n It's paranoia on both sides. I think one has to be somewhat paranoid to be an extremist and act so illogically. \n \n Apparently you too have too much time on your hands too. :p\n \n \nMy point is that there is a market for it today, and there was practically no market for it only 40 or 50 years ago. As for them being Christian women, well I guess it's that different planet thing again. \"Unreal\" is your word - may I use it too? :)\n\n \n Wrong. The market was there, it just hadn't been tapped yet.\n \n There's been a market for gossip and sensationalism since the dawn of man.\n \n Sure, but you'd be using it incorrectly. The logic I presented to support my assertion is pretty solid.\n \n \nI don't desire it - it's one of the things I like, (but I do like to eliminate it with a formal debate once in a while.) It's often an attempt to stifle debate, to bombard one person with several responses to one question, to bleed them out on time. I could go through a long list of people who generally agree with me who have left these forums, probably for that reason.\n \n \n Let's see the list...\n \n Any current posters?\n \n \nThose who answer posts for another, as if they're afraid the one they are answering for isn't capable of answering, and then accuse others of paranoia, is the ultimate irony. \n\n \n Unreal. (proper usage)\n \n Answering a post has absolutely nothing to do with being \"afraid the one they are answering for isn't capable of answering\" and everything to do with the desire to express one's own thoughts\n \n Not once have I responded for the reason you seem to believe that people respond. I respond because I see something in the exchange that I have an opinion on. Again, it really is that simple. No paranoia, no conspiracy.\n \n \nIt could also be a reflection that these are very liberal forums, largely because conservative posters have been driven away by the gang style of posting. \n \n If you think these forums come anywhere close to representing mainstream America, well, it's that different planet thing again. Unreal. \n\n \n I don't suspect they do on many subjects, on some others, I think they're fairly accurate.\n \n What I do believe, is that you don't represent mainstream America. Your lack of back up on the forum on the issues of religion, and evolution in particular, are very representative IMHO, as even the die hard conservatives here don't support you on most aspects of these issues.\n \n Given the polarized nature of politics in the USA, I suspect many of your positions are far more mainstream in that arena.\n \n \nUh, no because you would be praising him, and his not being here to defend himself would be a non issue. There is a difference between praising someone behind their back, as opposed to putting them down behind their back. You wouldn't understand, it's a Christian thing. \n\n \n Ohh I see, you're going to get high and mighty on me. LOL :p\n \n So praising equals OK, criticizing is bad, especially if that person is not present to defend themselves. I'll remember that one.\n \n I think Chad Pennington should hit the pine ASAP. If the Jets are going to have a chance and evaluate for next year, Clemens needs to play. I guess that's not OK to say, seeing as how Pennington isn't here to defend himself. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nYou're the king of \"little shots\", it was just a little humor, for you and anyone else who happened to read the end of the ABOR debate, since you said the exact same thing to me. (last sentence only) Doesn't surprise me that you have a double standard. I didn't feel a compulsive need to address it there.\n\n \n No double standard. I welcome them, you just need to get better at it.\n \n The difference is mine are original at least, and generally somewhat humourous. :p\n \n Waxy",

I think it's clear it would not be, because we've become much more religiophobic. Which is sad, really. The founders like Jefferson and Franklin, who weren't Christian, respected their Christian colleagues. That Christians, deists, and even agnostics were able to come together out of respect and form the Union is indicative of how much things have changed. People who are hostile toward religion sometimes invoke people like Jefferson, but Jefferson was not hostile toward religion. He was respectful of those around him who were religious, and that is contrast to those who invoke him today who ARE hostile toward religion. \n \n And before you assume I'm only talking about respect toward Christians, I think it goes both ways. I think we can also assume that Christians were probably more respectful then too, than they are today. Religious people back then, IMO, were more libertarian in the way they viewed public policy. They had more of a 'it's-not-my-business' approach to morals in society. I would like to see Christianity return to this way of thinking more, and consider morality more of a personal matter.\n \n\n \n Classic jyoshu comment - there is no argument like a straw man argument - \"religiophobia\" indeed. You love to revel in fantasies of your own marginalization and persecution. There is only recently a small backlash against the outrageous excesses of politicized religion in the past 3 decades and you shout \"unfair\". Any disagreement with purported Christian ideas is interpreted as hostility to all religious persons. Holding the opinion that belief in the supernatural is personally non-sensical is bigotry in your eyes. The excesses of Christians in recent years certainly warrants criticism, especially given the entrenchment in the highest government offices and this should be perceived as a threat to religion and vigorously opposed. Yet you paint such criticism as bigotry and intolerance. \n \n There is no religious persecution in the US today, at least not of Christians. The country is more church-going than ever in its history and many times more than it was in the days of its founding. Jefferson and Madison and Franklin and Washington were openly contemptuous of organized religion - not of spirituality, but the political power of the fat little pastor. \n \n There is the occasional objection to the public Creche (which I don't personally see what the fuss is about), but no Christian has his ability to practice his religion inhibited in any possible way. There is objection to the outrageous vocality and politicization, however. If you act like an XXX and someone objects, you claim victimhood. In addition, you religionists are explicitly called on your cr@p only in forums such as these, as any criticism of religion in public is still considered impolite and intolerant and \"disrespectful\" no matter how justified.",

There was MORE religion in govt. in the past, not less, so it's odd that only suddenly, in the last 30 years there would be a \"backlash\" when there was no less religion in government all along. For instance religious statements were added to the pledge and currency long before 30 years ago. It's the not the level of religion in government that has changed, but rather the attitude towards it. And yet, the sky never fell before that backlash. The country didn't fall apart with \"under God\" in the pledge.\n \n \nAny disagreement with purported Christian ideas is interpreted as hostility to all religious persons. \n\n \n No it isn't.\n \n \nHolding the opinion that belief in the supernatural is personally non-sensical is bigotry in your eyes. \n\n \n Nope. Haven't said that either. My, you are fantasizing today.\n \n \nThere is no religious persecution in the US today, at least not of Christians.\n\n \n Wow, you're 3 for 3! :) That's yet the 3rd strawman argument you've thrown out there.

You don't seem to have any respect whatsoever of religious spirituality, and instead contempt.\n \n \nIf you act like an XXX and someone objects, you claim victimhood.

   "Are you by any chance, if not a Tory, an Anglican? Is this what's really upsetting you? So sorry we wouldn't let you pull your Christian Principles over on us:\n\n \n I'm not even white or from England and it wouldn't matter. your argument is still fundamentally weak. \n \n \n\n Like wow, did John Adams really say that? And to Hezekiah Niles? I don't believe you, Dude. emoticon_cry\n\n \n And that proves what? That Adams believed they were doing it. How does that actually prove that the polices were indeed based on Religion?\n \n People say that Bush lied for his this or that. According to your logic here, he did that despite any actual evidence that he indeed did what they said. All Adams is presenting is his view of how and why. He like you, does not present actual evidence that the Crown made policy on religion. Hence why I said from the very beginning you need a crown document showing that policy was indeed crafted from religion. I also mentioned how hard this would be. \n \n This is the grand thing about objectivity. Just because someone accuses someone of something it does not make them guilty on a evidence less accusation. Do you know why Nixon resigned? Because we had proof that he did what people said he did. If the tapes did not come out, much or all of his involvement would have been secret. In this case, Nixon is the policy and the tapes are religion. You need to prove that the policy was indeed objectively from religion instead of just accusations. Hence you need a crown document. This isn't difficult. \n \n \nWould you like to now argue that the Crown was really an atheist?\n \n Perhaps a Moslem?\n\n \n You seem to have a problem with people picking out the flaws in your argument. I don't care or know what the Crown was outside of mercantilist. You are the one making the claim that they were. You need to prove it. I'm not saying you're wrong. You could be right, but you need a better argument.\n \n \nYou were provided a document directly from the Crown\n\n \n One that was over 200 years prior to the implementation of crown policy. I already explained to you why your argument is absurd. Again I will provide a example why it is absurd. During the early times of the colonies, only white land owning males could get legally married. Since that was over 200 years ago, the essence of marriage is actually only for white land owning males. I have no proof that such a law is indeed valid or contemporary. How is your argument any different in a principle way?\n \n \nand the onus is on you to show that (1) it was no longer relevant at the time of Revolution\n\n \n How so? You are the one trying to prove that the Crown's policy was Christian principle based. Therefore you have to prove it was relevant. I asked you if it was relevant. I did not say it was not relevant. You haven't been able to prove it is relevant. Thus your argument fails.\n \n \n(2) that the colonists were delusional in their uprising (which seems to be your unAmerican implication -- sure you're from heah, fella? oh ha ha just kiddin')\n\n \n How is that even relevant? Delusional in what? \n \n \n\n Unless you think that one must prove that Constitution is still relevant two hundred years later? Rather than demand falsification of its relevance from its attackers?\n \n\n \n Do you simply ignore how you are wrong and repeat the same refuted arguments time and time again? I already cited how the Constitution is relevant as it is the test for laws to see if they are valid. You provided no such similar piece of evidence for your document.\n \n \nBe rational, and go get your proof, or admit defeat.\n \n Don't disgrace yourself by lying anymore.\n\n \n Defeat in what? I have no position other then your argument needs better evidence.\n \n 1) You failed to prove your crown document was relevant or valid\n 2) You failed to prove that religion was the primary motive for policy\n \n As those are the key points for proving that the Crown was acting on Christian principles, you haven't proved your point. \n \n Show me where I lied.\n \n \nIf there were mercantalist and church interests in action, you have both.\n\n \n IF. Now prove that. \n \n \nIf you drop a dollar in the plate on Sunday, you have both.\n\n \n That's far from your point that mercantalism was religion based. We live in a economy that is the antithesis of mercantalism and Churches still have those plates. Care you address that hole? \n \n \n\n If you have (as a result of Parliment TAXING) the Church of England coming, \"with all its creeds, articles, tests, ceremonies, and tithes,\" and prohibiting \"all other churches, as conventicles and schism shops,\" YOU HAVE BOTH.\n\n \n And that represents Christian Principles how? Or have you just used whatever you wish it to mean? There's no point talking about this if you are going to pull a Marc9000, where you can define words to mean whatever you want whenever you want. \n \n There is a thing call scripture. I suggest you start using it. \n \n \n\n You have a major (NOT minor or secondary) issue about CHRISTIANITY and ITS PRINCIPLES being imposed.\n \n\n \n If you didn't read the article you'd think that. Notice how the vast majority of that article is dominated by legislative authority. Have you even read the declaration of independence? Tell me, how often does religion as the REASON for breaking away come up opposed to legislative authority/autonomy? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nBut now, you are making the \"MY god is the REAL Christian God\" argument (therefore, the bad mercantalist king wasn't acting on REAL Christian principles). And which can't be proven or falsified.\n\n \n You're finally getting it. I stated in the very beginning that I don't know and added why I don't know. \n \n And again, I'm not a Christian.",

It is a ridiculous argument for gun control to espouse that deaths from gunshot would not have occurred if there were no guns. People would simply find other ways to kill people. Are you going to outlaw scissors, knives, baseball bats, lead pipes...? Weapons are not responsible for killing people. There is no co-responsibility attached to a gun.\n \n I'm not agreeing that Christianity performs no evil. While it is true that Christianity does not actually enable the hatred as a gun enables killing by actually performing the tasks necessary to send the bullet toward the victim, Christianity enables the Christian to hate someone else (homosexuals, for example) by instilling a sense of condemnation upon that somone else. Christianity is not an active go-between that causes the hater to hurt the victim. It is however, a large part of what shapes the minds of Christians into thinking their's is the only way.\n \n IOW, I can kill you with a gun. I cannot kill you with Christianity.",

People would simply find other ways to kill people. Are you going to outlaw scissors, knives, baseball bats, lead pipes...? Weapons are not responsible for killing people. There is no co-responsibility attached to a gun.\n\n \n Oh, this is an old and outworn argument -- I've been on too many gun boards to fall for this one. Of course there is. It's a weapon that allows you to kill more people, faster and at a safer distance. Fewer people would die were it not for the existence of guns, simply because committing mass murder would be more difficult. Also, knives and scissors etc. have other practical purposes -- most guns, with the exception of hunting rifles and shotguns, manifestly do not. Their sole purpose is as a weapon to be used against other people. That doesn't absolve people from personal responsibility in using them, nor is it an argument for an outright ban, but they do make it easier to commit murder, and pretending they don't carries zero credibility.\n \n Same with religion, because it provides justification for murder. Do I really have to quote Leviticus? Or are Christians going to repudiate the entire book as nonsense?\n \n \nI'm not agreeing that Christianity performs no evil. While it is true that Christianity does not actually enable the hatred as a gun enables killing by actually performing the tasks necessary to send the bullet toward the victim, Christianity enables the Christian to hate someone else (homosexuals, for example) by instilling a sense of condemnation upon that somone else. Christianity is not an active go-between that causes the hater to hurt the victim. It is however, a large part of what shapes the minds of Christians into thinking their's is the only way.\n\n \n Well, I rather disagree that Christianity isn't a direct cause here, but even if it were not one, but only an enabler and condoner, it would still be open to criticism and accusations of responsibility. Christian theologians do have a choice: they could choose to welcome gays with open arms as part of the human race, and not accuse them of sin whenever they express love for one another. Instead, a lot of them focus on everything that distinguishes gays from the rest of straight humanity. Now I think that's pretty sick, and the only motive I see for doing it is belief in this religion.\n \n \nIOW, I can kill you with a gun. I cannot kill you with Christianity.\n\n \n That's only the difference between means and motive. A good detective takes everything into account. A gay-basher can kill a homo, but he usually needs a gun, baseball bat or can of gas to accomplish this, together with a reason.",

   "Obvious_child,\n \n In the case of the John Adams letter, you have a description of principles in operation. Whereupon, with the actions of Parliament putting aspects of the system into gear, the Church of England was coming to America (with all its tithes, ceremonies, religious leaders, etc. etc.), and, that insight on the part of the colonists (spurred on in part by Oxenbridge Thatcher's relentless efforts to the point of illness), a major aspect of the American Revolution.\n \n In the case of the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion, you have a legal declaration from the Crown that (1) they are the Supreme Head of the Church of England -- a declaration of basic \"Christian\" principle -- and (2) EVERY time they act, they act in accordance with the Christian God Himself -- yet ANOTHER declaration of basic \"Christian\" principle. IOW, when the Crown acts, Christianity acts! \n \n How much more Christian principle do you want? This is a foundational document to Anglicanism and the nature of the Crown.\n \n Indeed, we do not declare the principle at the outset of every action. Remember this for mathematics. Now remember it for church and state. Ask yourself: does the Pope, for example, declare himself head of the Catholic Church each time he acts or speaks? Yes, it's a little different, but no, it's not. Does Bush say, \"I am a President and, therefore, in this case I have the right to do such and such.\" No, not quite. But it's clear.\n \n And indeed, as we see in John Adam's description, this was the case in more than more than one respect. Not only what the Crown asserted they believed about themselves, and declared as LAW, but what happened in terms of the Church's efforts, whenever the State made effort. Or visa versa. Who based what on whom is virtually irrelevant. It's like the old question about the chicken and the egg. And the mercantalism feature has no negating influence either. Economics and religion easily can go hand in hand, for any number of reasons. \n \n Furthermore, in the case of the John Adams letter, you have the reinforcement of this view presented by the Crown. IOW, he describes the VIEW the colonists had of the Crown - exactly in line with the presentation of its royal Self, declared by the Crown in the Thirty Nine Articles; then, he asserts that it was the fact that this view CHANGED among the colonists that was the real American Revolution.\n \n The real revolution was in the hearts and minds of the colonists. That makes sense to you, does it not? Do you think they were just a group of mindless fools? (If so, take a seat with George and the Loyalists. Or the Anglicans hoping the Church of England WOULD get in.)\n \n Because those stupid fools had MENTALLY shot the King of England down from the heavens. He was human, and challengeable, no longer sitting next to Jesus Christ Himself. No longer entitled to dictate as he pleased. No longer even entitled to their prayers. Hell, they were going to pray for their damn selves!\n \n It was a remarkable shift in perception, and, for so many people.\n \n Now, that's my perspective. I fall in with John Adams. Though it certainly wasn't the perspective of those loyal to the King. So, if you have another argument, more line in with George's (i.e. of their delusion and delinquency), and besides the blanket assertion that this was only what John Adams \"believed,\" and, I suppose, the colonists, then go ahead and PRESENT IT. Only what John Adams believed, is pretty weak. For, by golly, anything reported is only what we believe at any given point in time, is it not?\n \n Learn how to discuss, for a change. It's much more interesting than watching you try to defeat a pov simply for the sake of winning.\n \n Note, too, that if your position is simply that Christian principles can only be argued on the basis of scripture, this conversation is over nothing more than semantic issues.\n \n In which case, if you value intellectual honesty, and discussion, rather than bull-headedly dumb \"debating,,\" own up to that, and be finished.

   "Obvious_child,\n \n I think we'll just have to agree to disagree on this one. My points have been made, but I see you repeatedly missing them.\n\n \n Oddly you are doing the exact same thing. But your argument is based on a term you cannot define and by usage and context means anything anyone wishes it to mean. Sure you can prove that they were acting in such principles, but when your obvious definition of those principles means anything you want it to mean, why even bother arguing it? \n \n \nAll I know is that one is a conservative Christian, often arguing on the basis of their faith, which they are certainly entitled to as a viewpoint, but is not my position here at all.\n\n \n I'd hardly call that person a Christian. Well, not a good one at least. Okay, a bad Christian. I can accept that. No wait, he's not a Christian, he's a biblist, a worshiper of a book.\n \n \nI certainly don't think the English Crown chopping off heads is an example of Christian principles in action.\n\n \n Then you disagree with your argument. Either you accept that anything the Crown does is Christian principles or you do not, or you accept that the term has no static meaning. In that case there's no point in discussing something on the basis of a term that has essentially no meaning. \n \n \nBut as I've said more than once, I am not using \"Christian principles\" in that more \"pure,\" abstract sense\n\n \n Abstract? How is scripture abstract? \n \n \nFor, returning briefly to the original board thread, if a power structure like a Church asserts that brutal biblical \"truths\" from Leviticus are, indeed, Christian principles -- even if another Christian church says they are not -- you still have an example of \"Christian principles\" from the brutes.\n\n \n Hence why you need to go sola scriptura. Catholicism is notorious for non biblical beliefs. And then there is the issue of why certain books are canonical and certain are not.....so this entire thing may be completely futile. \n \n \nOr are you arguing that there are only certain Christian churches that have the \"real\" Christianity?\n\n \n Nope. Frankly, I have no real idea what constitutes Christanity aside from believing in Christ.\n \n \nYou seem to divorce abstract principles from organizational structure. Which is odd, since many Christians assert that religious belief or identity as \"a Christian\" is inseparable from membership and attendance in a Christian church.\n\n \n For the Anglican Church you have to. For other denominations no. The Anglican Church is special because it was a tool of the English Crown. Instead of secular power being subservient to religious power, religious power was a tool for the secular power to do what it wanted. Hence in that case you need to separate principles from structure. The Vatican is different. There are few denominations which were created solely to support the secular power who created them. \n \n \nThe fact that you refuse to acknowledge where I'm coming from, and on so many matters, doesn't mean that I haven't said it enough times already.\n\n \n You did the same thing at least five different times repeating the same arguments and ignoring how they were refuted. \n \n Still, your argument resides upon a term that has no meaning. I see no value at all in any aspect in arguing upon that. \n \n \n\"Christanity is not synonymous with Religion.\"\n \n Says you.\n\n \n To disagree with me is to believe that all other religions are in fact not religions.

That the hundreds of millions of Shintos, Hindus, Toaism, Buddhists and every other believer aren't following a religion?

   "Some vignettes from the recent \"Values\" Voter Summit organised by the Colorado-based Christian right mega-ministry, Focus on the Family, and its Washington lobbying arm, the Family Research Council last month, as captured in a series of interviews by Max Blumenthal:\n \n \"We Want Sodomites Quarantined\"\n \n That was from featured Christian speaker Star Parker. Lou Sheldon opined that anyone could become gay. And then there was this knee-slapper from Christian activist Brandon Vallorini of Vision America, one of the fascist organisations on the Christian far right:\n \n \nMax Blumenthal: But under a Biblical order, I mean, ... would the death penalty be imposed for blaspheming, homosexuality...\n \n Brandon Vallorini: I guess in that time it was.\n \n MB: But what about...\n \n BV: What about it today? That's a great question. Again, and I, I would want to be careful to say that we want to do what God says we should do.\n\n \n But please don't quote me as saying we should stone gays to death, though that is what \"God\" tells us to do.\n \n The whole video can be watched at Blumenthal's blog.\n \n It's not pretty, but this is what Christianity has come to mean to millions of people.",
