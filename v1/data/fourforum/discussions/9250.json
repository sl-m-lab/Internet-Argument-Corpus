   "Exactly as I have been saying. So much for the \"Chicken Littles\" who are predicting doom and gloom at every opportunity.\n ==================================\n November 30, 2006 \n Thinking About the Trade Deficit\n By Steven M. Warshawsky\n \n George Mason University economics professor Russell Roberts, who runs the CafeHayek blog along with his colleague Don Boudreaux, has put together a short but sophisticated presentation about the trade deficit and its effect on domestic employment. Roberts seeks to rebut the common claim that the trade deficit leads to a loss of American jobs (recall Ross Perot's \"gaint sucking sound\" comment). Roberts' analysis is convincing. I won't repeat his analysis here, but I would like to make a few related comments.\n \n As any reader of CafeHayek knows, the \"trade deficit\" does not represent a draining of wealth from the United States economy. On the contrary, our purchases of goods, services, and raw materials from overseas suppliers adds to our overall level of prosperity. Indeed, if they didn't, we wouldn't make the purchases. After all, no one forces millions of Americans to buy Toyotas, for example. They do so because they prefer the price-quality mix of Toyota automobiles to those offered by other manufacturers.\n \n The evidence shows that, despite the persistence of large trade deficits since 1976 (see Russell's report for the data), American society has become much, much richer in the past thirty years....\n \n (snip)\n \n In fact, our \"trade deficits\" are one of the sources of our prosperity.  Not only do they reflect the availability of cheaper and/or more desirable foreign products, which increases the quantity and quality of American consumption, but the competition from foreign firms (again, think Japanese auto makers) has spurred developments and improvements in our own firms beneficial to consumers. \n \n Furthermore, the term \"trade deficit\" itself is misleading, because it usually refers to the merchandise trade deficit (i.e., trade in such things as autos, steel, and textiles). As Roberts points out, when capital accounts and services are added to the mix, our imports and our exports are almost perfectly in balance, as economic theory postulates.\n \n So much for the notion that trade deficits undermine domestic prosperity...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.americanthinker.com/2006/11/thinking_about_the_trade_defic.html",

Spend some time looking at the CIA facts and figures for each country. I ignore what is patent nonsense. I can do the math and anyone else can. A $250 budget deficit is less than 2% of our annual GDP. Our total national debt is 64.7% of our GDP. Here is what the CIA says about the U.S. economy. You can look up every nation in the world to make necessary comparisons.\n \n \"The US has the largest and most technologically powerful economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $42,000. In this market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms make most of the decisions, and the federal and state governments buy needed goods and services predominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms enjoy greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, to lay off surplus workers, and to develop new products. At the same time, they face higher barriers to enter their rivals' home markets than foreign firms face entering US markets. US firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances, especially in computers and in medical, aerospace, and military equipment; their advantage has narrowed since the end of World War II. The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual development of a \"two-tier labor market\" in which those at the bottom lack the education and the professional/technical skills of those at the top and, more and more, fail to get comparable pay raises, health insurance coverage, and other benefits. Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20% of households. The response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 showed the remarkable resilience of the economy. The war in March-April 2003 between a US-led coalition and Iraq, and the subsequent occupation of Iraq, required major shifts in national resources to the military. The rise in GDP in 2004 and 2005 was undergirded by substantial gains in labor productivity. Hurricane Katrina caused extensive damage in the Gulf Coast region in August 2005, but had a small impact on overall GDP growth for the year. Soaring oil prices in 2005 and 2006 threatened inflation and unemployment, yet the economy continued to grow through mid-2006. Imported oil accounts for about two-thirds of US consumption. Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, sizable trade and budget deficits, and stagnation of family income in the lower economic groups.\"...\n \n (Snip)\n \n https://cia.gov/cia//publications/factbook/geos/us.html#Econ\n \n By comparison, Canada's debt to GDP is 69.6% of GDP (2005 est.)\n \n Here is what is said about Germany, with a large trade SURPLUS.\n \n \"Germany's affluent and technologically powerful economy - the fifth largest in the world - has become one of the slowest growing economies in the euro zone. A quick turnaround is not in the offing in the foreseeable future. Growth in 2001-03 fell short of 1%, rising to 1.7% in 2004 before falling back to 0.9% in 2005. The modernization and integration of the eastern German economy continues to be a costly long-term process, with annual transfers from west to east amounting to roughly $70 billion. Germany's aging population, combined with high unemployment, has pushed social security outlays to a level exceeding contributions from workers. Structural rigidities in the labor market - including strict regulations on laying off workers and the setting of wages on a national basis - have made unemployment a chronic problem. Corporate restructuring and growing capital markets are setting the foundations that could allow Germany to meet the long-term challenges of European economic integration and globalization, particularly if labor market rigidities are further addressed. In the short run, however, the fall in government revenues and the rise in expenditures have raised the deficit above the EU's 3% debt limit.\"\n \n https://cia.gov/cia//publications/factbook/geos/gm.html#Econ\n \n Germany's Public Debt: 67.3% of GDP (2005 est.)",

The receipts of current SSA withholdings actually exceed what is currently being paid out.  The danger is down the road. Not now. There is no \"deficit\" in SSA receipts and expenditures. \n \n Several decades ago this was changed to just put them into one pot instead of seperate entries. It just all goes into general revenue. It is like one bank account instead of two separate bank accounts instead of but with the same income. Don't you remember all of that bulloney that Al Gore was dishing up in 2000 about the \"lock box?\" He was trying to make the case that SSA was being \"raided\" to fund other federal programs. It might have had some validity if it were true but it wasn't. SSA is safe until about 2035. Medicare is a different matter.\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \"It's a remarkable thing. Out of all the possible problems to address in America, Social Security is probably not even in the top ten. It's solvent for at least the next 40 years, and possibly the next 50, even if we do absolutely nothing. Some very minor adjustments on either the tax or benefit side would keep it solvent forever. (For example, the Social Security Advisory Board says that even if you addressed the problem solely by tax increases, you'd only have to raise the current payroll tax from 6.2% to 7.1%. That's not exactly Armageddon, but of course you don't learn that until page 21 of this report, which on page 3 talks about Social Security's \"looming financial shortfall.\")...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_10/004944.php\n \n Having said what I have said, I would much prefer individual control over one's retirement and do favor partial privitization of social security. But it's not a big issue one way or another with me. It's a non-problem; even less a problem than the dreaded trade deficit and \"inflation.\"",

   "Employers boosted payrolls by 132,000 By JEANNINE AVERSA, AP Economics Writer \n 1 hour, 56 minutes ago\n \n WASHINGTON - Employers boosted payrolls by a respectable 132,000 in November, but the unemployment rate edged up to 4.5 percent as jobseekers streamed into the labor market by the thousands with the onrushing holidays. \n \n The tally of new jobs added to the economy last month marked an improvement from the 79,000 new positions generated in October and was the most since September, the Labor Department reported Friday. It was mostly a cheerful economic message at a time of year when shopping peaks.\n \n Although the unemployment rate crept up from a five-year low of 4.4 percent in October, the politically sensitive number also pointed, nevertheless, to a labor market that is in good shape despite a slumping housing market and a struggling auto sector that are weighing on overall economic activity.\n \n \"The job market remains sturdy,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. \"It is creating a good number of jobs, unemployment is low and wage gains are strong. That is providing a lot of financial cheer as people make their ways to the malls for the holiday.\"\n \n By historical standards, a jobless rate in the range of 4.5 percent is relatively low. More than two decades ago, for example, civilian unemployment went over 10 percent during the President Reagan's first term in the early 1980s.\n \n Thousands of people - encouraged by brightening job prospects - poured into the labor market looking for work last month, a factor that played a role in pushing the overall civilian unemployment up.\n \n The increase in payrolls was stronger than the 105,000 jobs that economists were expecting. Analysts were anticipating a rise in the jobless rate, however...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061208/ap_on_bi_go_ec_fi/economy_10",

   "One more report and the sky hasn't fallen yet.\n ========================================\n Unemployment claims drop to lowest level in 2 months \n Posted 12/14/2006 8:56 AM ET \n \n By Martin Crutsinger, Associated Press\n \n WASHINGTON - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped sharply for a second week, pushing claims down to the lowest level in two months.\n \n The Labor Department said 304,000 newly laid off workers filed claims for unemployment benefits last week, a drop of 20,000 from the previous week, when claims had fallen by 34,000.\n \n The two straight weeks of big declines pushed claims to the lowest level since they were at 300,000 the week of Oct. 14. The recent decreases bolstered the view that even though economic growth has slowed sharply this year, employers are holding on to their workers in anticipation of an economic rebound.\n \n Labor Department analysts cautioned that it is difficult to get a clear reading on layoff activity in the period between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day because the holidays disrupt the normal pattern for filing claims.\n \n Still, the big decline of 20,000 applications was far better than the drop of 4,000 that economists had been expecting. The claims report was just the most recent indication that the labor market is holding up well in the face of the current economic slowdown.\n \n The government reported last week that employers added 132,000 jobs to payrolls in November after adding just 79,000 jobs in October. The gain occurred in spite of the fact that construction companies slashed 29,000 jobs last month, reflecting the big downturn in housing this year, while manufacturing lost jobs for a fifth consecutive month as the nation's automakers continued to struggle...\n \n (snip)\n \n http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/employment/2006-12-14-jobless_x.htm?csp=34\n \n Stock market up 60 points as of this writing.

The analogy given to me the other day goes like this:\n Imagine a child with a yo-yo. The child is playing with the yo-yo and it is going up and down. The child is also walking up a set of stairs while playing with this yo-yo. That is the trend of the market. \n While the short-term ups and downs can not thoroughly prove the health of the American economy, the upward trend line, I believe, can. We are at an all time high for the DJIA today which is nice, but we have also had (at least for the company I work for) double digit returns every years since 2003.\n (The S&P has not been quite that successful and that last line was a promo statement for my company emoticon_xangel ). \n I have to agree with MM in saying that we are going to be alright in the long run but who knows for the nearer term, we may have a correction soon with buyer exhaustion starting to be exhibited, we may not. As far as inflation goes, I don't know if there is a really great way to truly measure it. It varies from sector to sector. For instance, the tech sector is experiencing deflation. We all know that the PS3 is going to come down in price eventually. Many people will wait a while for it to drop a hundred dollars then buy one. Same with the games. Same with the current high power PCs. Once a better one comes out, and they come out faster than ever now, the prices will drop. My dad bought a 20Mb harddrive PC back in the 70's for $5,000. Today, he wouldn't be better off melting down the copper in it and selling that. Now if we look at another sector like automobiles, that sector doesn't exhibit too much inflationary pricing either but it does some. But there are sectors that exhibit very high inflation. The reason I find it hard to swallow that inflation is at 8%+ is because that would mean that the US money supply would be doubling every 9 years (rule of 72). I know people's annual incomes are not doubling every 9 years on average (they'd have to be unless our standard of living is dropping and I am not aware of it). \n Well, these are my thoughts on this topic.

In example, using US debt as a portion of GDP is only external debt as published by the CIA.

They had no choice. \n \n Equity markets are every bit as deceptive as the US government in their published reporting, they like US Government numbers, which is why any serious equity investor who doesn't maintain working models pays big money for private subscriptions. \n \n Rule of 78s is more important when considering consumer debt in an economic equation as the front end interest contributes to GDP distortion due to being entirely transactional in nature while postponing equity transfer. Use NPV and NFV with appropriate discount factors when looking at debt and money supply.",
