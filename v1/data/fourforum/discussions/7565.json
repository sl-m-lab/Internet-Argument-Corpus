   "Philo-Xenia\n \n In regard to Philo-Xenia, I cannot offer a precise definition, I can only tell an old family tale.\n \n My grandparents on my mother's side migrated to what was South Dakota in the very early 20th century.\n \n My grandmother was largely unschooled, literate, but keen and intelligent and diligent in exposing her children to the love of reading and good literature, as she in her poorly educated state could determine.\n \n Another aspect of my grandmother's personality was the old custom of extended kindness and hospitality to strangers. This was exemplified in her extension of her household's hospitality to a traveling Arab pedlar. This fellow was feared by our neighbors, the inherent xenophobia of the exclusively white population of that time. He was dark. He had a strange accent and strange ways that did not resonate with what they recognized as human company, he very likely WAS NOT A CHRISTIAN.\n \n My grandmother welcomed this man when he passed through the region and she was probably the only Dakotan of that time who was brave enough and principled to extend this welcoming to him.\n \n Some years later, after her death, the pedlar again passed through that region again. When he learned of her death he was profoundly silent and wept bitterly at her death. The death of a very fine and principled person.",

   "Well! Here's an interesting thought.\n \n In modern times we tend to think of erotic love as that which occurs between a woman and a man and has a high sexual content.\n \n But, it would seem, Plato, Socrates, those who expounded on the various sorts of love, yes, it would seem that these chaps were not thinking of sexual love between a woman and a man, inasmuch as in the eyes of the foregoing, a woman simply was not worthy of having love bestowed upon her, an inferior being useful merely for breeding.\n \n They desired beautiful young boys, these fellows, but it would seem that they sublimated their desires by having a devoted gang of young boys following one around, lapping up one's every word of wisdom, and this sort of thing was deemed to be \"Platonic\" love.\n \n I suppose, in light of the views espoused by these ancients, that the more true expression of erotic love to be shown on Valentine's day should be that felt by an older lover to his young catamite.\n \n Truly, what a damping thought to have on Valentine's day!",

   "Fun post. Yes, the greeks had a lot of words for love, makes love less mysterious...maybe that's why in English we lump them all into one which always leaves us guessing :)\n \n Philo-Xenia\n \n I've got one of those too (well, almost), but this time from the perspective of \"NOT A CHRISTIAN\".\n \n ================\n There was an atheist living next door to an old woman who was a Christian.\n \n Everyday he could hear her praying and praising God for all of the things He had done for her. One day the old woman fell on hard times and had no food in her house.\n \n The atheist overheard her praying to God to please send her some food. So, off the atheist goes to the grocery store [determined not to let the old lady starve, since he's certain prayers by definition cannot be \"answered\"].\n He bought two bags of groceries and, after placing them on her porch, he rang her bell and then hid in some nearby bushes.\n \n When the old woman came out of her house, she saw the bags of groceries and started giving thanks to the Lord for sending her the food.\n \n At that point, the happy atheist JUMPED from the bushes and shouted, \"AH-HA! The Lord didn't send you those groceries! It was I who put them there!!!!\"\n \n Without a pause, the old woman shot back, \"PRAISE YOU DEAR LORD. NOT ONLY DID YOU SEND THE GROCERIES, YOU MADE THE DEVIL PAY FOR THEM!\"\n (http://www.llerrah.com/atheistpays.htm)\n ===================\n No act of kindness goes unpunished?\n \n ;)",

They don't see a truck coming up behind them.\n \n Do you let the fool continue enjoying their activity, or to you interevene out of a sense of moral obligation, ethics, or just plain old fashioned compassion?
