   "I figured someone would post this by now...but I guess not.\n \n I just finished reading the CBO's estimate of the Baucus healthcare plan. \n \n For those of you that don't want to read it the basics are as follows:\n [*]Cost = $829 Billion[*]Reductions to deficit over b 2020 is $81 billion\n It is paid for by the following:[*]$201 billion in a new excise tax on \"high-premium\" healthcare plans (those at $8,000 for single person). [*]$404 billion net savings by reducing payments in various Medicare-caid programs[*]$110 billion in other net savings[*]$196 billion in other revenues (ie taxes)\n This plan would insure 29 million more people and leave 25 million others without insurance raising the percent insured to 94%. \n \n I didn't read anything about reducing the cost of healthcare overall for everyone.\n \n There are some other details but these are the basics. Any thoughts?\n \n Since you asked...my thoughts are this.\n \n I wanted to see a few things. 1)Decrease the cost of healthcare 2) increase the number of people insured. Both of these should be done without increasing the deficit. \n \n I'd say mission accomplished for number 2 on that list and without increasing the deficit (assuming it passes as is). This bill doesn't seem to address decreasing health care costs and I'm wondering what the effect would be on health care costs. The CBO just assumed it would go up the same rate as it has been. It would be nice to see this addressed in the \"bill\" though. \n \n Finally, it should be noted that a bill is not yet written but is rather a plan that is laid out.",
