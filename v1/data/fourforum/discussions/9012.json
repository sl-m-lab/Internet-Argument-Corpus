It's not their fault that the RCC has these rules; yet these gays have religious convictions as well. it's not just being part of a club. You are considering them hypocrites because they aren't leaving the church or openly opposing the church, but in doing that you're only leaving them very polarized all-or-nothing options. They are dealing with their religious convictions and personal beliefs that are wholly separate from their sexuality. That's why they often stay in the church. Again, for some their convictions on religious matters outweigh the issue of sexuality.
