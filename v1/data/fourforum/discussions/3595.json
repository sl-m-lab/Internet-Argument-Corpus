I'm pretty sure he said that we'll find you, hunt you down wherever you are, and bring you to justice.\n \n \n2. lies about reasons for war (WMD's, terrorism, liberate Iraq)\n\n \n First of all, I wouldn't say he lied. Lying would mean the CIA, Britain, Egypt, and Russia told him there were no WMDs, but instead he told us there were. However, EVERY SINGLE ONE of those sources told him that either Saddam had WMDs, was seeking to buy WMDs, or was planning to restart his WMD program. Now, I consider that more along the lines of being given bad information rather than flat-out lying. That's a pretty serious charge to make when you have no clue about the situation.\n \n \n3.

He has been the first president to lose jobs\n\n \n That, in and of itself, is true. But failing to point out that we lost 1,000,000 jobs in 30 days after 9/11, which caused tens of billions of dollars in damage to our economy, is rather selective on your part. And in the last year, we have created more than 1.9 million new jobs. The unemployment rate is lower than the average rate in the 70s, 80s, and 90s.

And you still expect him to respond to the terrorist action, the loss of lives and jobs, and yet not go over budget? I doubt the budget had planned for 9/11 to occur.\n \n \n6. Wants to put an amendment to block a freedom (all other amendments give rights, not take some away)\n\n \n If this is your biggest concern, you need to check your priorities.\n \n \n7. Took the most vacation time as any president\n\n \n This is absolutely incorrect. This obviously came from Michael Moore's movie. According to an August 2003 article in the Washington Post, President Bush has spent all or part of 166 days during his presidency at his Crawford, Texas, ranch or en route. Add the time spent at or en route to the presidential retreat of Camp David and at the Bush family estate in Kennebunkport, Maine, and Bush has taken 250 days off as of August 2003. That's 27% of his presidency spent on vacation. Although to be fair, much of this time is classified as a \"working vacation.\" Ronald Reagan spent 335 days and Bush Sr. spent 543 days. \n \n This tops any vacationing done by Bush, which has mainly been traveling back to Texas. During the Clinton years, Hillary, Chelsea, and a dozen of their friends took a trip to North Africa in 1999 during spring break, at the expense of our tax dollars. The airfare alone cost us $2.3 million, and the remaining cost us at least $5 million. At least Bush's travels are relevant, and not some bogus trip at the price tag of $10 million.\n \n \n8. thought reading for 7 minutes was more important than protecting this country (it would take 45 minutes for a missile to come from Iraq, he killed 7 minutes)\n\n \n So you would prefer that Bush jump up, scare the hell out of the kids, and run out? Wait...Iraq? I thought we were talking about 9/11? Why would a missile be coming from Iraq?\n \n \n9. He can't talk (OK so maybe not a reason to hate him, but it's true)\n\n \n And Kerry can't think. \n \"I actually did vote for the 87 billion, before I voted against it.\" \n \"It is against the law to hire people illegally.\" \n He told supporters in Wisconsin that the Packers played at \"Lambert Field\".\n He said that Eddie Yost played for his hometown Red Sox, which he never ever did.\n He said he watched the ball go through Bill Buckner's legs in the 1986 World Series, when in fact he was in Boston that night and the game was in New York.\n What is wrong with this guy?\n \n \n10. Drove away almost all of our allies in the world\n\n \n Who? We have almost the same number of allies as we did in the 1st Gulf War, which Kerry voted against. France, Germany, and Russia all said they wouldn't join us in Iraq even if Kerry is elected. How did he drive away allies? I think Kerry drove away any possibility of bringing more allies to the table by saying it's the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time, and calling our allies members of the \"coalition of the bribed and coerced\". Tell me, how exactly does that bring allies to the table? Why will they put their citizens' lives in danger to fight in a \"wrong war\", only to be called \"bribed and coerced\"?\n \n \n11. has worsened our image on the world stage and protrayed us as a bully\n\n \n Because we seek to kill terrorists? I could really care less what Jacques Chirac thinks about us. Our national security comes before any opinion of some foreign leader or citizen. \n \n \n12. Uses the excuse \"it's hard work\" (if it's so hard, we'll relieve you of all this HARD work tommorrow)\n\n \n John Kerry used some derivative of \"I have a plan\" at least 30 times in the debates, yet nobody knows what exactly his plans are.\n \n \n13. accuses Kerry of flip-flopping but he's done his share too (not saying it's bad)\n\n \n He has not flip-flopped on the major issues that threaten the security of this country...ie Iraq, Patriot Act, death penalty for terrorists, or funding our troops. A candidate should have a concrete stance on those issues.\n \n \n14. Still won't admit he has made one single mistake with all these bad things that have happened.\n\n \n What mistakes has he made? Other than going to war on the presumption that we would find WMDs, which he gathered from every intelligence community, and taking over Iraq so quickly, what mistakes has he made that he has ignored commanders on?\n \n It's pretty easy to see that you got most of these from Michael Moore. Get a clue and get your own facts rather than relying on some scumbag like Moore to provide you with his \"view\" on facts.",

Bush had a plan to go into Iraq before 9/11 happened.\n\n \n How did he lie? He was given this information by British intelligence, Russian intelligence, Egypt, and our own CIA. I would consider saying those agencies were wrong or didn't conduct themselves properly, or maybe were even tricked by Saddam, but how can you accuse Bush of lying? He simply took the information given to him to be credible. Most people would do the same when the CIA, MI-6, Russia, and Egypt are all telling you the same. Bush never implicated connections between Saddam and 9/11. He implicated connections between Saddam and terrorists, which there is a connection. He harbored several terrorist groups, he was a terrorists himself, and he paid families of terrorists $25,000. The UN had 12 years and 17 or 18 resolutions to take care of Saddam. Saddam continually refused to allow inspectors to inspect all sites, he hid most of his scientists, and threatened to kill anyone who gave out their secrets. And you think one more resolution would have solved it all? Saddam had a track record of defying the UN and bribing them with his oil. The UN is about as corrupt as Saddam's regime. How could we trust the UN, who had a stake in seeing Saddam remain in Iraq?\n \n \nLets say that he was honestly mistaken. It was his decision to go to war. The reasons turned out to be wrong, and it cost us many American lives. Why won't he admit that he was mistaken? His administration has done it's damnest to have no accountability. It's disgusting. In fact, him or Cheney, I forget, have said that they would not change a thing if they had to do it again. How blind do you have to be?\n\n \n Looking back on it now, it's easy to be a Monday morning quaterback and say \"Hey, there were no WMDs and therefore we shouldn't have gone in.\" Don't you think if we knew that in 2003 we wouldn't have gone in so quickly? We gave Saddam 17 or 18 chances throughout 12 years to prove he had no weapons and he would not comply.\n \n \n \nWhen the President is hearing God telling him to go to war with a sovereign nation, we have problems. Using your faith to guide you is one thing. Hearing voices is another. Congress authorized it based on the mistakes and outright lies that Bush told them.\n\n \n So blame him for being religious? \n \n \nRegardless of jobs, Bush's policy of spend spend spend and tax cuts and expensive war will turn our currency into confetti.\n \n \n And Kerry will change this by proposing programs that will cost $2 trillion, yet he will only be able to bring in $800 billion by raising taxes on the rich. How is that being fiscally responsible? How can you cut the deficit when you spend more than you bring in?\n \n \n \nhaha, you ask what is wrong with Kerry?! Bush has many many more verbal snafus. Why aren't you asking what is wrong with Bush?\n\n \n Like I said, Bush isn't the best speaker, but you know what he stands for. Kerry can speak, but nobody knows where he stands. When did we judge a candidate's ability based on his grammar?\n \n \n \nKerry has a much better chance than Bush. He might not be able to do it, but with Bush in office there is no chance.\n\n \n With his health care plan, Kerry has no chance.\n \n \nBecause of the way we went about this entire affair. It was divisive, it was imperial, it was immoral, it was wrong. You might care less what he thinks, but we better care real quick what the world thinks of us. We need them, and it's getting to the point where it is more than they need us.\n \n Our national security depends somewhat on the opinions of foreign leaders.\n\n \n It was divisive to go after those who attacked us, and those who posed a threat to us?\n \n \n \n \nYou would if you went to his website and listened to him in the debates.\n\n \n I did, numerous time. All he said was \"I have a plan\" or \"I would have done it differently\". That's called Monday morning quarterbacking.

I doubt the budget had planned for 9/11 to occur.\n \n\n $6 billion is a LOT of money. Giving tax cuts doesn't help anything.\n \n \n\n If this is your biggest concern, you need to check your priorities.\n \n\n Read the rest of this, there are other concerns.\n \n \n\n This is absolutely incorrect. This obviously came from Michael Moore's movie. According to an August 2003 article in the Washington Post, President Bush has spent all or part of 166 days during his presidency at his Crawford, Texas, ranch or en route. Add the time spent at or en route to the presidential retreat of Camp David and at the Bush family estate in Kennebunkport, Maine, and Bush has taken 250 days off as of August 2003. That's 27% of his presidency spent on vacation. Although to be fair, much of this time is classified as a \"working vacation.\" Ronald Reagan spent 335 days and Bush Sr. spent 543 days. \n \n This tops any vacationing done by Bush, which has mainly been traveling back to Texas. During the Clinton years, Hillary, Chelsea, and a dozen of their friends took a trip to North Africa in 1999 during spring break, at the expense of our tax dollars. The airfare alone cost us $2.3 million, and the remaining cost us at least $5 million. At least Bush's travels are relevant, and not some bogus trip at the price tag of $10 million.\n \n \n\n So travel time doesn't count?\n \n \n\n So you would prefer that Bush jump up, scare the hell out of the kids, and run out? Wait...Iraq? I thought we were talking about 9/11? Why would a missile be coming from Iraq?\n \n\n Well since they saw the guy tell Bush something they knew something was wrong. And a missle could have come from much closer. Also he could get up quietly, tell them there is an important matter to attend to, and leave. He wasn't doing anything but listen anyway.\n \n \n\n And Kerry can't think. \n \"I actually did vote for the 87 billion, before I voted against it.\" \n \"It is against the law to hire people illegally.\" \n He told supporters in Wisconsin that the Packers played at \"Lambert Field\".\n He said that Eddie Yost played for his hometown Red Sox, which he never ever did.\n He said he watched the ball go through Bill Buckner's legs in the 1986 World Series, when in fact he was in Boston that night and the game was in New York.\n What is wrong with this guy?\n \n\n The first one makes since. He changed his mind, it's allowed. Bush has made way more mistakes. \"We will not have an all-volunteer army\" one of his recent ones.\n \n \n\n Who? We have almost the same number of allies as we did in the 1st Gulf War, which Kerry voted against. France, Germany, and Russia all said they wouldn't join us in Iraq even if Kerry is elected. How did he drive away allies? I think Kerry drove away any possibility of bringing more allies to the table by saying it's the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time, and calling our allies members of the \"coalition of the bribed and coerced\". Tell me, how exactly does that bring allies to the table? Why will they put their citizens' lives in danger to fight in a \"wrong war\", only to be called \"bribed and coerced\"?\n \n\n He acted stubborn and unwilling to listen to anyone else, that drives away others.\n \n \n\n John Kerry used some derivative of \"I have a plan\" at least 30 times in the debates, yet nobody knows what exactly his plans are.\n \n\n Phrases are different from excuses. This is an excuse. Having a plan isn't an excuse.\n \n \n\n He has not flip-flopped on the major issues that threaten the security of this country...ie Iraq, Patriot Act, death penalty for terrorists, or funding our troops. A candidate should have a concrete stance on those issues.\n \n\n Flip-flopping is not a bad thing. You can change your mind as circumstances change. Basically I already decided this and nothing will make me change my mind. It's called stuborness.\n \n \n\n It's pretty easy to see that you got most of these from Michael Moore. Get a clue and get your own facts rather than relying on some scumbag like Moore to provide you with his \"view\" on facts.\n\n \n It's the job of the media to report the facts. Other than the debates and speeches, how else am I supposed to get information. The only fact I used from Michael Moore was the part about vacation time. And even if this were the case the points are still valid.\n \n \n Close race tonight, won't know until tommorrow at least who the winner is.",

   "already answered with a link later.\n \n \n He lied about reasons for it.

   "zach, i disagree with point 8. it would take an iraqi nuclear missile at least 3 months to get to america, because they would first have to be built (well, first the materials would need to be purchased), and that would take a while\n \n if you're counting the balistic missiles, it would take at least 6 hours to get to america, because they would need to be flown in by plane, then set up and launched within 800 km of its target\n \n i think bush was safe sitting around for 7 minutes",
