Another point (made by deathlord52) is that not everyone owned slaves and so why should their living descendants be made to pay for those that did ? There are also millions of Americans who don't have roots going as far back as the time when slavery was tolerated, so why should they pay compensation ?\n \n As individuals of course we tend to view the past as \"what has been has been\" and we can't be expected to solve every problem that our history happens to have left unresolved. But, there is another view - which amounts to a claim for the collective responsibility of a society. Black people living right now will argue that they continue to be disadvantaged because of their history, so why shouldn't we (i.e. white society) be prepared to accept some disadvantage resulting from our history. \n \n There is a legal precedent for an entire society paying reparations - it was contained in the Versailles Treaty 1919, when Germany was expected to pay compensation for the material ruin it had caused (mainly in France) by waging the First World War.

Whatever happens after that is up to those given this 'reparation'. If squandered, they have only themselves to blame, and they can remain in squalor.\n\n \n I think the whole question of reparations to the decendants of black slaves probably boils down to something like this:\n \n Can a historic \"collective responsibility\" be inherited - thus making contemporary American society liable for a \"debt\" (to black people) that is a consequence of a human condition or institution that, in any case, was abolished about 140 years ago ? Are modern black people justified in their claim to the effect that they still suffer social, financial, and perhaps cultural disadvantage as a direct consequence of their ancestors' plight, and they ought to be compensated for these evils ? Any compensation, if granted, has to come from somewhere and where else other than the modern American taxpayer ?\n \n But, it has been generally argued, why should we be punished for a crime we did not commit; we cannot be expected to put right the wrongs bequeathed to us by history. On these grounds, or something similar, it's argued that the claim for reparation should be resisted. \n \n Well, I agree, it should be resisted - if only on the rather weak ground that to admit such a claim would set an unmanageable precedent, and there would be no end to similar claims from people citing an historical wickedness for their present disadvantage. I'm also not convinced that a \"collective responsibility\" can be inherited; but I believe this is arguable.\n \n The suggestion that the poor (meaning black people specifically here ?) could be given a free higher education as some \"compensation\" for their grievance seems reasonable; they get a chance that way to \"make it\" in economic terms, but whether that would be a satisfying cultural concession is another matter.",

Will some 'leaders' rail against it? Sure, because it is not 'free' money. There are conditions to its use, and lazy people cannot accept that.

If push ever did come to shove, I think it would only be fair to start at the beginning and take a hard look at whose colonies the original North American slaves were transported from against their will. Indeed, we would have to take a close look-see at the nationalities of those that originally transported these stolen peoples to fairly divey up the blame. It could get a bit ugly for Europe as well.\"\n \n \n \n \n Well said, there were a lot of countries involved in Slavery, not just in the US but in South America as well (Brazil).\n \n What about the people in Africa who sold their countrymen into slavery to earn a few bucks. If the descendents of \"slave owing\" countries have to pay reparations , it is only fair that the descendents of those Africans who sold the slaves to europeans in Africa should also pay reparations. Why just pick on one group (US)... go for everybody who was involved in this sordid affair.\n\n \n You are spreading guilt like butter on bread but you ought to know that two wrongs don't make a right and shifting the spotlight across the Atlantic won't help either. You are missing the point of this debate.",

The word can be used either as a pejorative or as a matter of pride, depending on context.\n Modern usage\n The redneck stereotype\n A redneck is a stereotypical southern United States socially conservative, rural, working class white person with sunburned skin and northern European ancestry. The stereotypical redneck is a male, has a beer belly, consumes cheap American beer such as Budweiser by the case, and holds deeply conservative political views. Stereotypically they are homophobic, racist. The stereotypical redneck also lives in a trailer, drives a large pickup truck with a Confederate Navy Jack flag decal and a gun rack in the rear window, has a stained sleeveless t-shirt, a trucker hat or baseball cap and a mullet haircut with long sideburns. Their favorite activities include hunting, professional wrestling, NASCAR, monster truck rallies, and car engine repair.

They are most often barefoot, pregnant and wear Daisy Duke shorts.\n The popular etymology says that the term derives from such individuals having a red neck caused by working outdoors in the sunlight over the course of their lifetime. The effect of decades of direct sunlight on the exposed skin of the back of the neck not only reddens fair skin, but renders it leathery and tough, and typically very wrinkled by late middle age. Another popular theory steams from the use of red bandanas tied around the neck to signify union affiliation during the violent clashes between United Mine Workers and owners between 1910 and 1920.\n Some historians claim that the term redneck originated in 17th century Virginia, when indentured servants were sunburnt while tending plantation crops.",
