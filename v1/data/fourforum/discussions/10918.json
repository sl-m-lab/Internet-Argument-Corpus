   "You may have heard the latest news out of Iraq concerning the use of Down's Syndrome afflicted women to carryout suicide attacks. Apparently, they are dressed in a false belly to make them appear pregnant and a bomb and remote detonator were placed inside. The young women were then told to walk into a crowd and the bombs were remotely detonated.\n \n DHS warns of 'Pregnancy Prosthetics'\n http://deepbackground.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/02/11/656670.aspx\n \n Report on Al-Qaeda's use of Down's Syndrome 'Suicide' Bombers\n http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=511678&in_page_id=1811\n \n My contention that this sort of escalation may actually lead to a rift within the ranks of the different sects of Muslims. I would think that the use of this kind of attack will harm the cause of not only the insurgents of Iraq, but also of Islamic militants everywhere. Each escalation, to new depths of depravity, will cause the more moderate and even some hard line Islamists to question the validity of Militant Radicalized Islam, sapping their support and possibly causing a backlash against radicals in general and the insurgents of Iraq in particular. What do you think?",

   "The reality is that last year the radicals in Iraq tied explosives to the wheel chairs of crippled children and sent them into mosques on the moslem sabbath when they were full of worshipers. One of the mosques was built in the 14th or 15th century if memory serves and was an historical landmark to the whole Islamic World. And neither CAIR or any Mullah's, Sheiks or Imam's spoke out in protest against such attacks on not only killing cripples, or worshiping moslems, or even mosque's. Why? because they fear the retribution of these Radicals who will kill any moslem who speaks against their religious War.\n \n The western mind is incapable of understanding that to these radicals life has no value what so ever. And to the masses of moslems who are slaves to this oppressive belief system, They only dare to speak up in protest when ordered by the local mullah to riot in the streets about cartoons that mock Mohammed. But never will they protest the beheading of civilians by those godless animals or any of the other terrorist attacks against innocent civilians that take place all over the Globe.",

I almost choked on my donut. How soon you forget\n \n Abu ghraib\n Guantanamo\n Maher arar\n Omar Khadr\n Khaled Masri\n Murat Kurnaz\n \n Unfortunately, I can't find the case of another man who was abducted by the CIA, tortured, found to be innocent (by the CIA) after just 2 months, but not told and still tortured for several more months after that. I'll keep looking.\n \n All I can say is, look outside the confines of what your frightened media have been telling you. I feel sorry for you that you cannot see beyond the propaganda of your criminal rulers. The US is torturing hundreds of innocent people (some to death). If you think this is acceptable just because a few are true terrorists who might have some secrets, then all I can say is, you are truly sick.\n \n Smiley",

When your argument is bad you make **** up.\n\n \n \n First of all, most of the post (about belittling the US involvement in the wars) was aimed at Smiley since he was the one who claimed the US was unimportant in the wars. Also, the US involvement in the WW's was more example of the selfless nature of the USA. Even if we came in 'late' we were essentially fighting a war (esp WWI) for the mistakes made by European powers. Yes, more Russians died in the wars. I never said they didn't. I was telling smiley that without the big bad USA Russia would have probably collapsed. We fought two wars for other nations and their colonies and didn't take anything of our own, so I don't see where smiley gets off saying that the US hasn't been looking out for the interests of the rest of the world, even at our own peril. I'm sorry if I offended you OC, but I think you mistook some of what I aimed at smiley, who thinks that he and the rest of the English will agree that the US's help to save their butts was little, late, and unimportant. \n \n Now we fight nearly alone, this time against powers who have declared war on the entire western world.",

   "Also, the US involvement in the WW's was more example of the selfless nature of the USA.\n\n \n That depends on which Historian's view point you take. Some would argue the US did it for its own future, some argue that the US did it for the free world, some argue this or that. \n \n \nEven if we came in 'late' we were essentially fighting a war (esp WWI) for the mistakes made by European powers.\n\n \n Not really. In fact, the US suffered far more causalities then it should have if it followed the lessons learned by the European powers. The ironic thing is that the French and British forced TOLD the US what not to do, aka packing infantry in the front trenches, not in the back and we ignored it causing unnecessary deaths from artillery. The Germans learned that mistake and changed their tactics, too late to win the war but enough to slaughter thousands of English troops. A fool learns from their own mistakes. A wise man learns from the mistakes of others. WWI was essentially everyone acting as a fool. What we SHOULD have done is look at the British tactic of using tanks to break lines and keeping most of the infantry in the reserve trenches. We did neither. And it cost thousands of doughboys their lives.\n \n \nNow we fight nearly alone, this time against powers who have declared war on the entire western world.\n\n \n Perhaps, but these forces, aside from using stolen Russian nukes, can cause relatively little damage. What we should be doing is curtailing their ability to gain access to such weapons. Bush was correct in his statement that the war on terror cannot be won, only suppressed.",

I wasn't trying to say (at first anyway) that the US is the only good thing on the planet, just responding to criticism that I've been hearing a lot that implies that the US is some evil force which lives to rape the planet and never doing anything for the good of humanity. Maybe we misunderstood each other. I've studied the WW's extensively and know the terrible suffering on all sides.

I can tell you that this is just not true. Your arrogance and overinflated sense of self importance is showing.\n\n \n No, of course not everyone. But come on, the US has been the beacon for 150 years. Because the people here have freedom and transparency, and there's been opportunity here for a long time. Not that this is the only place, I'm sure they'd jump at the chance to go to the UK or Denmark or anywhere in the western world but its true that a huge % of the world would love it here and there has been a dream of 'coming to America' throughout the world for a long time.

We didn't do it so we could sell people TV's later, that's all I'm saying.\n\n I agree that the US has done some great things throughout the world, but you cannot ignore that many other countries are doing likewise. And I was not trying to imply that the US were of no consequence at all, just that Great Britain and France had been fighting that particular war for many years with some success. The US joined the team and were obviously the extra man-power that tipped the balance. It certainly appears to Europe that the US only bothered to join in when they had actually been attacked on their own soil.\n \n This is mirrored somewhat by the attack on 9/11. The US suddenly becomes the white knight against terrorism, whereas I'm afraid to say that the US has been financing terrorist groups and oppressive regimes for decades in many parts of the world (for example - Mujahideen against the Russians, Shah of Iran who was oppressing his own, Iran-Contra Affair)\n \n In fact, it appears that the US is even now funding terrorists with links to Al-Qaeda in an effort to destabalise Iran.\n \n \nI wasn't implying that the USA is the ONLY place that does good things. However, it seems that many people are ganging up, shouting 'down with the US' thinking we're out there killing and torturing just for the fun of it.

The US would like nothing less than to concentrate on making movies and software, not war. The US has always tried to be a force for good. For freedom and opportunity.\n\n You may not have meant to say that the US was the only nation doing any good, but you did specifically say that the US was responsible for most of the good that has been done in the last 100 years. I would have been quite happily accepted contributed to or involved in.\n And don't think that the US has always tried to be a force for good. There are many links to terrorist organisations that are conveniently forgotten, as I have mentioned above.\n \nAsk them and they'll repeat the propaganda that they are brainwashed with. The US has always 'tried' to be a force for good. Much more than most. We have more respect for most people in other countries than their own govts.\n\n Are you saying that the rest of the world is subject to propaganda, but Americans are not? And I would like to see some evidence of this respect the US shows for the rest of the world when they are happy to invade sovereign nations, kidnap and torture innocent foreigners, covertly fund terrorist organisations to overthrow democratically elected leaders, carpet bomb heavily populated areas . . . the list goes on and on.\n \nNo, of course not everyone. But come on, the US has been the beacon for 150 years. Because the people here have freedom and transparency, and there's been opportunity here for a long time.

My point was that while if you as someone standing in the street in Africa or Indonesia or whereever they might burn the flag, but many would get on a plane if it was offered.\n\n There goes that propaganda again. I'm afraid you are just plain wrong on this one. The vast vast majority of the world's population really does not want to live in America. It may be because they have fallen victim to their own propagandda, but the fact remains that they really don't want to live in the US.\n \n And recent events show just how free you really are, with your phone calls being monitored, the books you check out of the library under scrutiny, not being aloud to where certain T-shirt within sight of Dubya etc.\n \nAgain, I've never disagreed with you on what they would SAY. It's easy to hate the big target. I see them burning the flags and whatnot. But then we see some of the same people wearing donated 'old navy' sweat shirts or eating relief food donated by the US.

Mostly you'll find charity, hope, and assistance.\n\n I'm sure you see people from 3rd-world countries wearing clothes and eating food donated by people throughout the world.\n \n I very much doubt that 'sour grapes' is a very popular reason for hating the US. The rest of the world really isn't jealous. I'm sure American propaganda is constantly saying that everyone else is jealous, and Americans will fall for that every day, but it's just not true. It may, of course be because the rest of the world has fallen for another line of propaganda, or it may be because they have seen the real America and just don't like it. Either way works.\n \n Smiley",
