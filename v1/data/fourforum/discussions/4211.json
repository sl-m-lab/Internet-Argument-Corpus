   "Sorry, I've been away.\n \n Ok, so these elections are a sham.\n \n Does that detract from the \"courage\" of the millions of Iraqis who showed up to vote in the areas that were safe enough? No.\n \n These people risked their lives, and some lost it, for a sham equivalent to a US election. \n \n The ballots are so easily corrupted and there are so many people with huge motives to corrupt them, that it's guaranteed that the election was all for show.\n \n It's amazing that Iraqis felt that they had no other choice but to show up and put a piece of paper into a Rubbermaid bin and risk death. I even think they realize that the National Assembly was already chosen.\n \n International observers were allowed to observe election in Ukraine, Afghanistan (like it mattered if they were watching it was so sloppy), but they were shooed away in the US and not present in Iraq. \n \n There's no way to know if ballot boxes were stuffed, if ballots that people risked their lives to cast were tossed, or whatever other forms of corruption were performed on them.\n \n So, the Iraqi people are very courageous and probably just as dumb as Americans when it comes to trusting \"the election process,\" especially when it's run by Americans and their puppets.\n \n What the election DID show is that Iraqis want democracy.\n While there were some nay-sayers that said they didn't, I wasn't one of them.\n I'm the kind of nay-sayer that realizes this is just American colonialism and that this election is the next step to having a fully functioning colony.",
