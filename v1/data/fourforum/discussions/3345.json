   "Fanatics Don't Talk to Other Fanatics - They Kill Them\n \n by Bradley Smith\n \n Fanatics do not talk to fanatics, unless those they talk to are fanatic about the same matter(s). Otherwise, fanatics shoot fanatics, bomb them, starve them, isolate them, cut off their heads, and act generally in a way that is tacky almost beyond belief. \"Almost,\" because human culture is soaked through with poor taste and fanaticism, so with a modicum of reflection we are able to observe what goes on.\n \n Cutting off the heads of innocent, unarmed civilians for a greater good is, if not normal, certainly human. What's that? Beheading innocent folk for a \"greater good\" is what small-timers do who do not have the funding to burn alive or blast into oblivion hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of innocent, unarmed civilians for a greater good.\n \n Well, terrorists are evil when they try to kill you, and swell fellows when they're killing the families and neighbors of those who are trying to kill you. So far Americans have killed somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000 innocent, unarmed Iraqi civilians for what the administration believes is a greater good. This suggests that Americans have wounded and maimed at least 50,000 innocent, unarmed Iraqi civilians. Probably more. Probably a lot more.\n \n The difference between the Arab terrorists who killed us, and the American soldiers who are killing the Arabs, is that the Americans can morally justify killing Arabs for a greater good, while the Arabs cannot morally justify killing Americans in any way whatever. Moral justification is always the ground upon which the terrorists stand.\n \n Americans morally justify intentionally killing Arab civilians for a greater good because Arab terrorists intentionally killed American civilians first. It has nothing to do with the individuals who are being killed. This is group think. If you're in the wrong group, and you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, your XXX is mud. Is this how we all are-or what?\n \n Arabs morally justify killing Americans because Americans fund the colonization of Arab land by Israeli Jews, and fund the Israeli military in a way that makes it is a foregone conclusion that Israeli Jews are going to have better numbers than Palestinians, or any other Arabs who get careless.

   "You are absolutely right. The majority of the reported news says the opposite but there are hundreds more stories that never make the news because they aren't connected with death, destruction or hatred.\n \n I have a friend who worked in Iraq recently and the overall picture is quite different from what the doomsday news media will tell you.\n \n When one admits that the majority of owners and operators of the news machines support the liberal agenda, one knows why the reporting is extremely biased and selective.\n\n \n \n I know that lots of newspapers try sooo hard to give the public an accurate\n emoticon_rolleyes description....... of what they think will make it bigger in the news!",

   "You couldn't have brutalized those stats any worse. Estimates show that Iraqi deaths may range from 10,000 to 30,000, and these deaths also include the deaths caused by suicide bombers, insurgents, and kidnappers who directly killed Iraqis. Saddam killed 75-125 innocent Iraqis each month for 8000 days. I think we have inadvertently killed around 38 a day. Check my post under the Afghan Elections where I cited this information because you fail to realize that those deaths are not the deaths caused by US troops; it encompasses all Iraqi deaths, whether by the hands of US or anyone else.\n\n \n Show me where you get your stats.\n \n I am going by http://www.iraqbodycount.net/ where they report 13-15K CIVILIANS killed by the US (which is 4-5 times as many killed on 9/11, which Iraq had nothing to do with).\n \n I can't find a good source for iraqi miltary and militant casualties because no one really counted that. All I can get are things that say:\n http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/aug2004/civi-a05_prn.shtml\n \nAccording to the statements of the organization, the figure of 37,000 does not include the casualties suffered by Iraqi military and paramilitary forces. The estimates of Iraqi military deaths during the invasion range from approximately 10,000 to as many as 45,000. As the study concluded last October, it also does not include the large numbers of civilian casualties inflicted by the US military in April and May, during its operations to crush the Iraqi uprising in Fallujah and Baghdad and across southern Iraq.\n\n \n Everyone flies numbers around, but they are all in the tens on thousands when it comes to civilians, even the conservative estimates.\n \n \n .",
