   "Presumably because you can crack the carbon off, and not have it heading off as CO2 in the atmosphere.\n\n \n Well hydrogen can be made from natural gas and it is my understanding most of it is; about 95% in fact. But the CO2 is still produced and unless it is sequestered underground it will be released into the atmosphere. The only three ways to produce hydrogen with no CO2 is through nuclear, wind/water and solar power generation to pry hydrogen loose. The space shuttles are powered by liquid hydrogen but that is from the production through conventional means. \n \n This sounds like a pipedream to me, although I firmly believe that hydrogen is indeed the fuel of the future but I believe it will come through conversion of seawater and solar or nuclear power generation. 10.8% of seawater is made of hydrogen. Getting it is another matter. Nuclear could work but the environmentalist wackos have given nuclear a bad name although it is proven technology. But it produces no CO2. So I guess they would rather burn carbon based fuels which do. They can't have it both ways.",

Only solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear do not produce CO2. If nuclear, a proven technology, were used to produce all of our energy, and if we had electric vehicles, we could dramatically reduce the production of CO2 which is the prime cause of global warming as I understand it. Merely using electricity to power our vehicles won't presently accomplish much because of the source of the energy production is produced from CO2 sources. And then there is pesky problem to be solved in extended trips. Short trips around town would likely be feasible, but how do we power our over the road vehicles, our large vehicles such as pick-up trucks? That can't be done with just electricity. At the very least a hybrid vehicle would be necessary or as in most cases, diesel power but again we get back to the CO2 problem.\n \n Nevertheless improved electric powered vehicles will become more common in the coming years even as improved batteries in power tools have become almost universal. Milwaukee Tools has a new 28 volt power hand drill that increased by a factor of three before the battery runs out. It will drill 300 holes in a 2x4 before exhausting the lithium-ion battery. It lists for $460 but you can get a sale price of $420. That's a lot more than the cheap drills you can buy down at the local Walmart. \n \n What would one do if they wanted to drive coast-to-coast in a motor vehicle? Current battery technology wouldn't accomplish that. That's why hydrogen still has to be considered. A fuel cell would work but we have to figure out how to obtain that hydrogen. Merely getting it from natural gas, where 95% of it currently comes from, still has the problem of the CO2 problem. Some of it could be sequestered underground but there is no guarantee that it would remain there. I suppose it might be possible to have a regular vehicle where we could simply swap out batteries at intervals under our hypothetical cross country trip. But even if that were possible with passenger vehicles, it would do nothing for over-the-road vehicles which need plenty of power to pull those heavy payloads. Generally they require a powerful turbo or even twin turbo diesel engine to get the job done. Electricity would never accomplish that. \n \n We could power our homes and personal vehicles with nuclear powered electric energy. But some applications will still require the burning of fossil fuels well into the future. What we need is dramatic breakthroughs and that's a while off. But at the current time, nuclear is the technology that will work. In this the environmentalists really shot themselves in the foot when they opposed the development of nuclear powered plants. Moral of this story. Be careful of what you wish for, you just may get it. So far as I know not a single nuclear power plant has been brought on line in decades.

The problem, however, is that 95% of the hydrogen is produced from natural gas and that releases CO2 unless it is sequestered underground. So in that respect it is essentially a zero-sum gain. This is why we need to extract the hydrogen using one of the four possible sources of energy that do not produce CO2; solar, water, wind or nuclear. Ultimately this will be solved when technology allows us to extract the hydrogen from ocean seawater. That will happen and there are 0% emissions from the burning of hydrogen. It may take decades but it will happen.\n \n Lithium-ion batteries are a quantum leap in technology but they are not without their issues. My Escape Hybrid uses the older nickel metal hydride technology. But they won't hold a charge that would allow a vehicle to be driven much more than about 20 miles before being exhausted; hence the need for the hybrid technology. A pure electric vehicle with advanced electric batteries such as the lithium-ion batteries might last 300 miles before being exhausted. Unlike the older technology they do not need to become completely exhausted before being recharged. However, they are age limited. They decline as they get older and are typically found in cell phones and laptops. This explains it rather well.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_ion_battery",

I use them virtually all the time around the home. When the battery runs dry I stick in a new one and continue with my business. The depleted battery can be charged in about one hour. I keep about six batteries ready to go in my various tools and lamps, etc. But for heavy duty drilling I still get out the corded power drill. And I wish we had battery powered full fledged vacuum cleaners to get rid of the cord that is always getting in the way.\n \n Milwaukee Tools has a new 28 volt professional drill that will drill 300 holes in a 2x4 before it is depleted. This is costly at about $460. A typical Craftsman (made by Ryobi) 19.2 drill can be bought for $40 and the battery pack about $30. Big difference but perfectly suitable for the home user which I am. The professional who has to be in construction needs a tool that he doesn't have to worry about running down quickly and has gobs of power. He may be standing on a steel girder up in the sky hanging steel and wants a tool up to the job. That's where the new batteries come into play.",

Surely it's always going to be better to make a more aerodynamic, slipperier car?\n\n \n It didn't make much sense to me, either, and for the same reason. \n \n Essentially what they found was that they could efficiently harness the wind turbulence generated by the vehicle by essentially redirecting it and putting it to use rather than just having to fight it. They found that the turbines would produce at maximum capacity at 90 MPH, but they went with the dual 1 KW units because they were more efficient than smaller sizes. \n \n If you just stuck fans to the top of the car, you would never see any benfiit because the additional drag of the fans would neagte any electrical generation. What they did in their experiment was basically figured out how to use the fans WITHOUT creating excess drag for their application. Essentially what they were doing was ducting the air form the bumper and the engine compartment (or motor compartment as the case may be). CArs are always going to have to have bumpers and air flow through the engine compartment (even an electric motor has to have air flow to stay cool). Rather than the air slamming into the bumper and flowing into the engine compartment then slamming into the firewall, they have it slamming into a pair of turbines. \n \n What I am most skeptical about is the amount of energy you would be able to capture in that manner. I would imagine that with careful design, you could probaly get the full 1.6 KW out of the system on a large truck (semi) at highway speeds. For cars what they were essentially proposing was an air duct down the middle of the car so they could harness the turbluence formt he bumper and grille area. They also proposed air scoops in the front fenders with doors that opened to admit air when you brake...similar to flaps on airplane, which would boost the system while helping you accomplish your goal (to slow donw or stop). I personally think that with the advances in regenrative braking, the flap thing is probably out the window since the mechanical linkage between the ground and your tires is a lot more efficient as a way to convey power than using the wind. Currently a lot of the power from regenerative braking is wasted/bled off, but reverse charging systems are advancing quickly, so there is little doubt in my mind that this will be overcome whihc would make flaps on a car unnecessary and wasteful.",

   "There is no shortage of solar or wind energy. Solar and wind power is something else. Energy is what they have that we use to PRODUCE power. If there was no shortage of solar and wind power, this conversation would not be taking place.\n \n Face it, mule. You have been shot down again. We can all add \"alternative energy\" to the list of things you like to rant about even though you have NO CLUE about it. \n \n Even if solar WAS a viable option, it would never happen. You know why? Because solar pretty much ahs to be decentralized due to transmission and conversion losses. We have to use low step transformers with it because high step transformers would have too high a loss to be acceptable. \n \n Solar heating has been a reality since the 70's. It is simple, cheap, reliable, cost effective (I know that the solar wall at my house paid for itself in less than a year) and relatively convenient (low, low maintenance). We could cut 25% of the worlds CO2 emissions JUST by switching to solar heat and solar hot water. \n \n So, Mule, why don't you tell us about your solar heating and solar hot water setup. \n \n The truth of the matter is that Americans are so lazy, and so used to being pampered, that even when you go \"look...FREE HEAT\" they don't bite. They don't want to be inconvenienced, they don't want to have to have something ugly on their house, they don't want to mess with it. They want to turn the thermostat and burn fossil fuels to generate their heat and hot water because it is EASY.\n\n \n I'm glad we can agree that there is no shortage of solar power. That being the case as technology advances we will achieve the means to convert ocean seawater's hydrogen component. We obviously cannot \"burn\" solar power although solar panels might power ultra light weight vehicles. But hydrogen fuel cells can be used, in all kinds of weather and is already a viable fuel for short distances. It could be burned using high pressure tanks (a less desirable option) or through fuel cells with electric motors. That has already been accomplished. But it would not work in heavy duty equipment with present engine technology. The power demands would be too great.\n \n If it were currently technologically possible, we could extract hydrogen and store it to be used as an inexhaustible energy source. \n \n To show the advance of technology, the first transister was in 1947. Today's run of the mill P4 chip has around 55 million transisters on a small square wafer. Had someone in 1947 suggested such a thing was possible they would have been taken away in a strait jacket to the funny farm.\n \n I reject your view that nuclear is hamstrung by lack of raw materials. \n \n You need to move away from negative thinking into the daylight of modernity.",

   "An inexhaustible supply is not the same as an infinite supply. Forgive me, but if you have spent money and energy building a solar panel, isn't it better to use 100% of the electricity it produces, rather than wasting 99% of it and powering your car with the other 1%? There may be an inexhaustible amount of solar power, but we are only able to capture a finite amount of it at any one time.\n\n \n Certainly it would be preferable to have 100% efficiency but we don't even have that with current run of the mill automobile engines which are perhaps 30% or so and that doesn't take into account the energy expended to getting the fuel to distribution centers for sale to the general public. \n \n What I am merely saying and it was a bit of hyperbole is that even if we used 100% of the harnessed solar power produced only 1% in return we don't have to give up anything because there will never be a shortage of solar power. Obviously it would be wonderful if we could simply strap a solar panel to the tops of our vehicles and drive on-board electric motors but that isn't currently technologically possible at the present time. \n \n This problem is going to be looked at many different ways. Ultimately what works best at the lowest possible price will win out in the long run. And it's a moving target. Who remembers eight track tapes, or even casette tapes?And now VCRs are moving into the antique category. And CDs after that. That's the advance of civilization and it is moving faster exponentially. I don't have a crystal ball on my desk but for anyone to say that something can't be done because the laws of physics prevent it would have been well at home during the middle ages when it was deemed a pipedream for man to have flown like the birds. \n \n There are two things that I am reasonably sure of. \n \n 1) We are not in danger of running out of carbon based fuels.\n \n 2) The use of that carbon based fuels leads to the increase in CO2 which affects our environment. \n \n Although we may have virtually unlimited carbon based fuels the reality is that they will ultimately be better utilized for other things such as plastic and other consumer and industrial goods but not fuels to power our personal conveyances. Other means will be found and most likely in solar or hydrogen alternatives; neither of which produce any CO2 that is released into the atmosphere. While hydrogen can readily be produced from natural gas that is a zero-sum gain as that produces CO2. That's why we need to get the hydrogen from solar, wind, water or nuclear, all of which produce 0% CO2.",

I'm waiting for you to inform us that the sun really will come up in the west tomorrow.\n\n \n I never argued that the price of oil is not subject to the laws of supply and demand. I argued that th primary force behind the increase in the cost of oil has been the decline of the dollar, which leads producers to demand higher prices for their oil. Big difference. \n \n \nThe reason, I believe, you make your statements has more to do with your gambling on the futures market and if you allow yourself to think outside of the confines of your ideology you will see that you are quite likely to go down in economic flames. That's clear enough to me. You just haven't realized that yet. I would suggest \"Gambler's Anonymous\" for your affliction.\n\n \n When I start loosin gmoney I may take your word for it. Currently (and in the past) I make money in the commodity markets because I understand that whole \"fundamentals\" thing that seems to completely and totaly elude you.\n \n As far as \"going down in economic flames\"...not possible. I have put enough away to live comfortably for the rest of my life and ensure that my children can do the same. The money I invest is just my play money. I can afford to loose it, though I won't because I am not an idiot who invests in things they don't understand.",

You have been beating the drums here constantly that the real cost of the increase in crude was the declining value of the dollar. If that were true, the price of crude wouldn't have gone from nearly $78 a barrel down to $55 a barrel for we certainly haven't had 30% dollar deflation, have we?\n \n Look, I can tell from your post that you are getting nervous about the commodity market. You can make all the money in the world and lose it just as fast. You are gambling with your future and your children's future with this nonsense. If you are ahead of the game, get out and put your money is a safe place like the U.S. stock market, or you don't like that, in the European stock market, or to be completely safe in bonds or CD's. You are trying to time the market and that is like bottom fishing in the stock market. You will likely lose. I used to think that investing in stocks was a license to print money. I learned my lesson the hard way after March 2000. Take your money and run and be glad you made the money you did and do something else with your time. You'll be happier in the long run.",

That is also why OPEC kept changin their target price and announcing that they were doing so due to dollar devaluation. The 60-78 range was based on geopolitical concerns and potential supply shortage. So, which would be the \"primary\" driver...the one that resulted in a $45 increase, or the bit at the end that resulted in an 18% increase??\n \n \n \nLook, I can tell from your post that you are getting nervous about the commodity market.

You'll be happier in the long run.\n\n \n As usual, you are dead wrong. Currently I only have one position open in commodities, and that is on copper, and thus far I am making out just fine on that. It does not matter which way the commodity market goes, you can make money either way. The last position on oil I had was wneh it hit $55 last time I opened a no delivery spot position (long) and then sold at $64. I told you that is what I was going to do oevr at whistlestopper. 2 other people who read that thread later send me mesages thanking me for the tip, they had done the same (bought spot positions at 55) and done very well with them.\n \n The only other position I have open with my \"play\" money right now is 60,000 shares of GM. I bought that way back when we were arguing about it. I am sure you remeber. You claimed that based on your test drvie of the Ford 500 (which later flopped) that ford was a good buy and thet GM was destined for failure, while I argued that only one company was likely to survive as a major player and the economic fundametals indicated that it HAD to be GM, there was simply no other way it could go, and I said GM stock was the better bet.\n \n I bought the GM, and as of right now am up roughly 52%. I plan to dump it soon as I think GMs numbers are going to be shite this next year. In fact, I owuld have dumped it a little earlier but I needed to hold it until after the first of the year for tax purposes. \n \n How did that ford stock work for you, Mule? We all know, so you don't have to humiliate yourself with an answer. \n \n Timing the market is not that difficult if you understand how the market works and how the underlyign fundamentals are likely to reflect on the market. Sometimes you win, sometimes you loose, but if you know what you are doing and pay attention to the fundamentals, you shoud be OK (that is a general statement...I think that you as an individual would crash and burn since you have exactly ZERO economic knowledge). \n \n I don't know if you caught the latest 1% survey (top 1% of american earners) but the share of their investments in US equity (stock) markets has fallen form roughly 33% last year, to 9 percent this year. What do they know that you don't mule? These are people who understand money far better than you ever will, and they are bailing on the stock market. I wonder why? \n \n I am a little confused as to why you think that ANYBODY would take economic advice from you. You are ALWAYS wrong. I have never, ever seen you make an economic prediction that was correct. Not once, not ever. You liek to harp on the fact that I said I didn't think we woudl ever see oil under $60 again. Do I really need to remind you that in that SAME conversation, you predicted that oil would back below $20 by now? I was off by $5. You were off by $25, and at least I have the warmest winter inrecorded history to fall back on as a pseudo excuse.\n \n You are never right about anything related to economics. If you said \"George Washington is on the dollar bill\" I would pull one out to see if they had changed it, and be surprised if they had not.

Now they are in financial trouble and have a poor cash position and no decent lines of credit left. \n \n GM, on the other hand, has enough cash reserves and gauranteed lines of credit that they do not have to make any money for the next decade and they will still be viable.
