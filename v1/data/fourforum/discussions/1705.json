   "Mass. High Court Rules for Gay Marriage\n \n \nBOSTON - The Massachusetts high court ruled Wednesday that only full, equal marriage rights for gay couples - rather than civil unions - would be constitutional, erasing any doubts that the nation's first same-sex marriages could take place in the state beginning in mid-May. \n \n The court issued the opinion in response to a request from the state Senate about whether Vermont-style civil unions, which convey the state benefits of marriage - but not the title - would meet constitutional muster. \n \n \"The history of our nation has demonstrated that separate is seldom, if ever, equal,\" the four justices who ruled in favor of gay marriage wrote in the advisory opinion. A bill that would allow for civil unions, but falls short of marriage, makes for \"unconstitutional, inferior, and discriminatory status for same-sex couples.\" \n \n The much-anticipated opinion sets the stage for next Wednesday's constitutional convention, where the Legislature will consider an amendment that would legally define marriage as a union between one man and one woman. Without the opinion, Senate President Robert Travaglini had said the vote would be delayed. \n \n The soonest a constitutional amendment could end up on the ballot would be 2006, meaning that until then, the high court's decision will be Massachusetts law no matter what is decided at the constitutional convention. \n \n [...]\n \n Massachusetts has one of the highest concentrations of gay households in the country with at 1.3 percent of the total number of coupled households, according to the 2000 census. In California, 1.4 percent of the coupled households are occupied by same-sex partners. Vermont and New York also registered at 1.3 percent, while in Washington, D.C., the rate is 5.1 percent\n\n \n That's it, boys and girls... only full-fledged marriage will suffice. Thank Heavens for the level-headedness of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.\n \n \n ADDED:\n \n Raw Data: Mass. Supreme Judicial Court Opinion (from Fox News)",

Therefore, the equal protection argument does not apply in unions of more than two people.\"\n \n As long as the number of people involved stays the same in the law, there is no argument for \"equal protection\" for polygamy. This is because EVERYBODY, would have the right to marry ONE other person, for a total of TWO people in the relationship. \n \n Courts interpet the law. A law that says \"Marriages do not have to be traditional\" would require the courts to look at what is traditional. A law that says \"Marriages are between two people\" only requires that the judge performs a simple mathematic equation. Everybody has \"equal protection under the law\" because everybody is allowed to marry ONE other person (see above paragraph for explanation). \n \n Why would same sex marriages have to be ratified into the constitution? I don't think the founders intended this. The constitution is not supposed to be changed for every law that comes along. There is no right specifically stated in the constitution for ANYBODY to be married. Why would we need to add one just for certain people to be married? If we added an amendment to the constitution allowing gays to be married, would that mean that heterosexual marriages would become illegal since they would not specifically be constitutionally protected?\n \n Again, where are you guys getting this?

The denyal of same sex marriage does not discriminate against anyone. \n \n Oh... and you asked were I got my info. Here is a quote from Chief Justice Margaret H. Marshall reagurding the majoraties decision in legalizing same sex mariages:\n \n In writing for the majority of the court, Chief Justice Margaret H. Marshall points out: \"The question before us is whether, consistent with the Massachusetts Constitution, the Commonwealth may deny the protections, benefits, and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry. We conclude that it may not. The Massachusetts Constitution affirms the dignity and equality of all individuals. It forbids the creation of second-class citizens.\" \n (this was from the boston globe nov 18 2003....you can find the quote in numorous places if you search google)\n \n So Cheif Justice, and her three followers in their infinite wisdom have decided to do some fuzzy interprating of first amendement b/c THEY believe protection should apply to sexual orientation under equal rights in civil marriages, and THEY dont care what the common wealth wants. So they impose their agenda, and the people of Mass have to just take it up the butt (No pun intended).\n \n But there is light at the end of this tunnel.

   "There is one correlation between Jim Crow laws, and the legalization of same-sex-marriages. And that correlation is self-serving interpreting of the constitution. \n \n The judges who made interracial marriages illegal did so on the basis of their own belief that they were \"protecting racial integrity\", and \"keeping blood pure\" (Loving v Virginia (1961)). (Just an FYI..It was mentioned earlier in the thread that most states made interracial marriages illegal. Only 16 states made it illegal).\n \n Could this be a case of judges pushing their agenda? I find it hard to believe even by a loose interpretation they actually thought dividing the common wealth based on race was somehow allowed by the 14th. Now I don't find it hard to believe they disliked black people and exploited their power to push their agenda. So in retrospect the judges deliberately ignored the constitution, and enacted a law, which completely undermined the rights given to citizens by the constitution, therefore deeming the law unconstitutional.\n \n The judges deemed no-same-sex-marriages discriminatory based on something that isn't even written in the constitution (right of marriage based on sexual preference). Civil unions were created number one to promote procreation, and incentives were given so that couples would remain married so the state would not have to \"take care\" of their children. Couples in same-sex-marriages cannot procreate together. Though they can take care of children, it says nowhere in the constitution that marriage is necessary to do so. So no-same-sex-marriages are constitutional.\n \n I have no problem with same-sex-marriages being legal. I have a problem with judges imposing their beliefs/agendas by finding loop holes.",

However, you seem to be saying that this means we are free to ruin it more. Why not fix it rather than making it worse?\n \n The question of whether homosexuality is a choice or a born-with tendency seems to have been decided in this debate. I don't agree....\n \n Why are there any homosexuals at all, if this is clearly a genetic thing? What about people who think they have changed? \n \n Those who have said that allowing polygamy is unlikely have a decent point. But, just consider the fact that we may be on the verge of giving fully equal privileges to homosexuals for the first time in history. Fifty, or two hundred years ago, the average person would have justly thought you were insane if you asked them whether they thought homosexual marriage should be allowed. That proves that the unthinkable can quickly become a big issue with enough pressure. \n \n Polygamists are consenting adults (so are some incestuous people). Why should we push our morality on them? According to the separation of church and state (which I think is a misinterpretation, or at least is becoming ridiculous with people suing the Boy Scouts for choosing 'selectively' because they recieve government funds) we should not! Its unconstitutional.\n \n So why do we? Well, for one thing, the constituition actually talks about equal protection under the law, not equal privilege. Monogamous marriage was considered to be the best thing for society, therefore it was encouraged and strengthened. I think I am very safe in saying that the majority of Canadians and Americans continue to beleive that the monogamous marriage is the best way to both create and raise a family. That's the real reason marriage is 'discrimanatory'. It actually isn't about morals or religion. It's about society.",

   "Excellent point. Marriage isn't in good shape these days. However, you seem to be saying that this means we are free to ruin it more. Why not fix it rather than making it worse? \n\n \n Marriage is a private thing with legal ties. It is not mine or your duty to fix everyone else's marriage, nor is it our business to define it for anyone else.\n \n \nThe question of whether homosexuality is a choice or a born-with tendency seems to have been decided in this debate. I don't agree....\n\n \n You don't agree with what? That homosexuals are born that way? If the answer is yes to this, have you ever questioned the gay person? Have you ever questioned your choice of orientation? \n \n \nWhy are there any homosexuals at all, if this is clearly a genetic thing? \n\n \n You might want to ask your Creator that question. S/he is the one that created them.\n \n \nWhat about people who think they have changed?\n\n \n Everyones path is different. \n \n \nThose who have said that allowing polygamy is unlikely have a decent point. But, just consider the fact that we may be on the verge of giving fully equal privileges to homosexuals for the first time in history. Fifty, or two hundred years ago, the average person would have justly thought you were insane if you asked them whether they thought homosexual marriage should be allowed. That proves that the unthinkable can quickly become a big issue with enough pressure.\n\n \n 200 years ago, the average person thought the same about black people. Thank God that we have evolved a bit.\n \n \nPolygamists are consenting adults (so are some incestuous people). Why should we push our morality on them? According to the separation of church and state (which I think is a misinterpretation, or at least is becoming ridiculous with people suing the Boy Scouts for choosing 'selectively' because they recieve government funds) we should not! Its unconstitutional.\n\n \n We should not push morality on anyone. Morality is subjective. It is in the eyes of the beholder. We cannot legislate morality. It does not work. The way I see life...to each their own, as long as they are not hurting anyone else.\n \n \nSo why do we? Well, for one thing, the constituition actually talks about equal protection under the law, not equal privilege. Monogamous marriage was considered to be the best thing for society, therefore it was encouraged and strengthened. I think I am very safe in saying that the majority of Canadians and Americans continue to beleive that the monogamous marriage is the best way to both create and raise a family. That's the real reason marriage is 'discrimanatory'. It actually isn't about morals or religion. It's about society.\n\n \n Encouraging monogamous marriage is a good thing...to teach your kids. Parents can teach simply by monogamous actions and good communications. As far as someone else's marriage...again, it is no one else's business but the people in the union. Here's an Abe Lincoln quote that you may want to try and understand...\n \n \"No man is good enough to govern another man without his concent.\"\n \n My biggest reason for believing in gay marriage is in my thread... \"Understanding Unalienable Rights\" in this forum. If you don't believe in gay marriage, do yourself a favor and understand them. Know this...if you believe you have the right to govern another man without his concent, man may decide to govern you next. What goes around comes around and it may be a piece of your freedom that is the next to go.\n \n Lilac",

Its highly contentions as to whether or not homosexuality is purely genetic while I've never heard anyone debate that black people chose to be black. (and I don't know why that would make a real difference) Also, we weren't changing the definition of marriage.\n \n The point is, no society has ever accepted homosexuality as equal to hetero. None. (whereas, there have been many societies who didn't discriminate based on color) We'd better be more than 100% sure before we do. Instead, it has been done by unelected judges while the majority of the citizens don't support it. This is no longer a real democracy.

What goes around comes around and it may be a piece of your freedom that is the next to go.\n \n Lilac\n\n \n Marriage is not a right. It is a priveledge granted to a man and woman because they are the future of society. If marriage were a right, somebody out there has an obligation to marry me! I demand my rights!! :) Rights and obligations go hand in hand. Thats why a person who fails to keep their obligation to respect other's liberty loses their right to liberty.\n \n The U.S. constitution granted equal protection to all its citizens - not equal priviledge. And you may notice that murderers have those protections taken away. That's not equality. But it is just. People may argue that a homosexual couple could benefit society by adopting unwanted children. Maybe that should be looked into. I am highly suspicious of the benefit - and legalizing homosexual marriage means we are about to put children in that situation without really having a clue how it will affect them. The last thing we should do is have homosexual marriage foisted onto a dissenting majority by an unelected few.\n \n I thank you for your reply - it has encouraged me to think - and I think that it is heartfelt - which is very valuable. That is an excellent quote, you don't know how much that means to me because that's exactly how so many people feel when unelected judges are making laws that effect the whole society. You're exactly right - what goes around comes around - and it probably will be my freedoms that are impinged apon next. Many consider the Bible hate speech. Elected legislators will never outlaw it (I think) but who's going to stop an unelected judge? But you never know whether it will reach you or not. An interesting component of \"Brave New World\" by Aldous Huxley and \"1984\" by George Orwell is that the loyal members of the Party often found the people they supported turning on them. (this also happened to many in communist regiems) The definition of an authoritarian government is the rule of many by an unelected few. We aren't there yet. We are only a psuedo-autocracy.

This happens all the time. \n \n b) It isn't true that most Canadians oppose gay marriage, two surveys done in 1999 and 2003 show that most Canadians are in support of gay marriages-\n \n 8/7/2003 9:13:29 AM\n Most Canadians Support Gay Marriage\n Support higher among catholics than among\n protestants\n A new national poll by Environics Research indicates that a slim\n majority of Canadians support allowing gay and lesbian couples to\n marry.\n A total of 2,018 Canadians were surveyed between June 12 and\n July 6, 2003. A survey of this magnitude yields results that can be\n considered accurate to within plus or minus 2.2 percent, nineteen\n times out of twenty.\n Currently just over half of Canadians (53%) strongly (28%) or\n somewhat (25%) support allowing gay and lesbian couples to\n marry. Over four in ten (43%) are strongly (31%) or somewhat\n (12%) opposed. Three percent are undecided.\n Support or opposition to allowing same-sex marriage fluctuates\n considerably by gender, age, level of education, religious\n affiliation, province and federal political preference.\n Support for same-sex marriage tends to be strongest among\n women, those under the age of 45, those with no religious\n affiliation, union members, those with university educations and\n those with higher incomes. Support is also significantly higher\n among residents of Quebec, British Columbia and the Atlantic\n Provinces and among supporters of the NDP, the Bloc Quebecois\n and the federal Liberals.\n Opposition tends to be strongest among men, those over the age of\n 60, Protestants, those with low incomes and those with a high\n school education or less. Opposition is also strong among\n Albertans, supporters of the Canadian Alliance and to a lesser\n extent the federal Progressive Conservatives.\n \n It is notable that, support for allowing gay and lesbian couples to\n marry is actually slightly higher than the Canadian average among\n those who consider themselves Catholic (57%). Although the\n strong support for same-sex marriage in Quebec tends to influence\n the overall numbers among Catholics, even comparing Catholics\n and Protestants in English Canada only, we find that there is\n significantly higher support for same sex marriage among\n Catholics.\n For more information please contact:\n Derek Leebosh\n Senior Associate\n Environics Research\n 416-969-2817\n derek.leebosh@environics.ca\n Question wording was as follows:\n ?Currently, gay and lesbian couples have the same treatment\n under Canadian federal law as common-law heterosexual couples.\n Would you strongly support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose\n or strongly oppose allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry??\n \n Canadian Majority Supports Gay Marriage\n Friday, June 11th 1999\n \n OTTAWA, Canada -- A majority of Canadians support the rights of lesbians and gays to marry according to a survey released today by the Toronto Globe & Mail.\n \n 53 percent of the 1500 adults surveyed said \"should\" when asked whether \"homosexual couples who wish to marry should or should not qualify for legal recognition of the marriage.\"\n \n The results were released one day after the Canadian House of Commons voted overwhelmingly for a law that stipulates that \"marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.\" The Commons' vote was in reaction to a landmark Canadian Supreme Court ruling that effectively gave same sex couples the same legal rights as common-law couples.\n \n The survey was conducted by Angus Reid Group for The Globe and Mail and CTV from May 25 to May 30 - after the Supreme Court ruling. The survey also showed majority support for other gay marriage issues, including the supreme court decision. 56 percent said they supported the Supreme Court decision, and 63 percent said \"gays and lesbians should ... be entitled to spousal benefits.\"\n \n Majority of Canadians ahead of their House of Commons.\n \n The results of the survey showed a very different public opinion than claimed by the conservative forces behind the Commons ban. \"There is a concern today that [marriage] is being eroded by some of the initiatives of the Liberal government, deferring to the courts and hiding behind the robes of judges,\" said Eric Lowther, a prominent Reform party conservative, justifying the passage of the bill.\n \n The 1500 Canadians surveyed by The Globe and Mail didn't seem to agree.",

Do some research before spouting off, next time. \n\n \n I knew when I said that homosexuality had never been accepted in a society, that the Romans had even encouraged homosexual relations in the army when they were on duty far away from female contact. \n \n However, I didn't know of any society that actually promoted homosexuality as equal to heterosexuality. I see that the Greeks did see homosexual love as a good thing in some forms. (http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/greekeros.html)\n \n It seems that the elevation of homosexual relations in Greek culture was because men were considered superior to women. Since homosexual love was love between equals, it was considered greater. (above link)\n \n Some people argue that it was partly due to class and power differences between men - something like pedophelia:\n \n \nYet, we should be extremely careful when we point to historical records. We must be aware of the social context of those periods. \n \n For example, it is often pointed out that there have been societies in the past when homosexuality was common and widely accepted, namely Ancient Greece and Rome. It might not have been the majority practice, but it was certainly much more open and much less marginalised than in later centuries in Europe.\n \n But we forget that almost all societies of any size before the modern time, were strongly stratified by class, and powerful men could do what they wanted with the less powerful. History alas, tends to be written by the powerful, so what has come down to us must be read with great care. Were homosexual relationships, whether loving or recreational, all that widely accepted? Or was it that such societies were simply more tolerant of class-exploitation?\n \n How many of the same-sex liaisons in Ancient Greece and Rome would be what we now call egalitarian homosexuality, i.e. a relationship of equals, which is how we expect love and relationships to be today? \n\n \n (http://www.vjc.moe.edu.sg/academics/dept/english/globalpositioning/nowplaying03_3.php - a pro-homosexuality site)\n \n The Berdache/Two-Spirit thing is interesting....\n \n \nIn this view, all human beings are dual in nature as well -- male and female. Humans are seen as minor relatives of the Goddesses and Gods, while animals and plants do not live on this plane of duality. When a human person is born, only one or the other twin usually comes into substance, into life on Earth -- the other half remains in the spirit world as a \"higher self.\" A woman on Earth has a male higher self, while a man on Earth has his female higher self....\n \n In pre-contact times, native American people had a great reverence for these Two-Spirit people. Quite naturally they viewed Two-Spirits as extraordinary sources of information about human nature. Two-Spirits were healers, artists, prophets -- whatever their personal vision impelled them to be. The native world had great respect for personal vision. If you were born a male, but came back from your first vision quest at 13 years and said your vision told you to live as a woman, your choice was honored. You even got a new name celebrating your choice! Likewise the woman who said she wanted to live as a man, love as a man, even fight as a man, was able to do that freely. \n\n \n (http://www.whosoever.org/v3i3/berdaches.html)\n \n I think that this is not homosexuality in the way we see it. We see it as a sexual relationship between people of the same sex. It seems to me that a Berdache was not considered to be their origional sex anymore. \n \n That really represents two cultures. Are there more? If not, then I re-assert what I said, slightly modifyed: The vast majority of cultures have not given homosexuality equal status to heterosexuality.\n \n I'm out of time right now, I'll reply to the rest of your post later.",

The last major poll on the issue, by Environics in September and October, found that 56 percent supported same-sex marriage and 42 percent opposed it. An Ipsos-Reid survey in August found respondents were evenly divided, 49-49, on the question.\n \n After courts in British Columbia and Ontario ruled earlier this year same-sex couples have a legal right to marriage, the Canadian government pledged to pass a measure legalizing the practice across Canada.\n \n But survey respondents show support for such legislation is lacking. In response to a direct question, 46 percent said the judges went beyond what laws and the constitution intended, while 34 percent said they followed the law.\n \n The Post reports the survey of 1,000 people indicates a shift in views with a new line of thinking developing on the issue: Leave marriage alone, but come up with another solution for homosexuals. Specifically, 37 percent said the definition of marriage should stay intact but a new category that includes same-sex unions should be created. \n\n (http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=35957) \n \n \n In the U.S, a poll indicated that a 2-1 majority support the traditional view of marriage.\n (http://www.family.org/cforum/fnif/news/a0030529.cfm)",

This is a living law meant to evolve with society, it leaves a lot open to judicial interpretation. The one man and one woman definition of marriage was written by a judge. Also, Canada has a Charter of Rights and Freedoms, created by the courts that Parliament agreed to support. The courts in Canada have found that the heterosexual definition of marriage violates the equality guarantees of the Charter. Parliament could pass a law tomorrow that said women do not have the right to work outside the home, whether such a thing stands up to Charter rights is another matter.

   " Here's an Abe Lincoln quote that you may want to try and understand...\n \n \"No man is good enough to govern another man without his concent.\"\n \n \n\n \n Yes. I believe he was talking about whether the Congress should have the right to decide whether slavery should exist in a territory, or whether the white settlers themselves should decide the issue. The point became moot in 1857 when the Dred Scott decision of the Supreme Court decided that Congress did not have the right to decide whether slavery should exist in a territory. Times was it was very unusual for the Supreme Court to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional. By effectively declaring the Missouri Compromise void (among other wretched things), the Dred Scott decision was only the second time that the Supreme Court declared an act of Congress void (the other case being Marbury vs. Madison). For crying out loud, Abraham Lincoln was nominated on the strength of his arguments against judicial innovation, which most northerners at any rate justly viewed with abhorrence. Go read his Cooper Union Address.\n \n The analogy with 1857 is startling. There are a people (the sodomized) enslaved by their abusers. Judicial innovation has decided that the states (much less the Congress) has no power to keep or enact laws to free these enslaved individuals. The Lawrence vs. Texas case is the Dred Scott of today. The Massachusetts Supreme Court imitates the tyranny of the Supreme Court of the United States. I believe the early penalty imposed by the Massachusetts colony against homosexuality was death. The Massachusetts judiciary I guess you could say has changed from one extreme to the other; see An Abstract of the Laws of New England (1641)",

Unless you have bi-sexual tendencies, there is no choice....\n \n Another way to find this answer is to ASK gay people if they had a choice. I am willing to bet most of them would say...\"are you crazy? What makes you think I would have chosen to be gay in a world of homophobes?\"\n \n\n \n I partially agee, Lilac. I think that it is likely that there a person can be genetically predisposed towards homosexuality, and when that is combined with environmental factors, a person may find that they are attracted towards people of the same sex and don't remember being otherwise.\n \n However, I beleive that a person can choose to change. There are people who have. I think it is also possible that some may not be able to change. The bible doesn't say that it is wrong to be gay.\n \n Is bisexuality considered a third \"orientation\"? Why isn't it an intermediate between the other two? In my opinion, that is a really slick way to avoid questions of why some people do seem to be able to choose and change.\n \n And, going back to the general topic of this thread; even if homosexuality is completely genetic and unchangable it doesn't follow that we should recognize a homosexual marriage as deserving of equal priviledge as a heterosexual one. The question is the benefit to society.",

The bible doesn't say that it is wrong to be gay.\n\n \n I agree that the bible does not say it is wrong to BE gay. \n \n If you look at hetero and homosexual on a scale, both on oposite ends of the scale, you have bi-sexuality in the middle of the two. Some people lean more towards gay and others towards straight. It's as simple as black and white on the same scale...with different shades of gray in-between. I believe this covers your next paragraph also.\n \n \n Is bisexuality considered a third \"orientation\"? Why isn't it an intermediate between the other two?

The question is the benefit to society.\n\n \n Considering both the bible and the Declaration of Independence, two very important documents in American history, both state that all men are created equal and are to be treated as such, I would say it is self evident that gay people deserve equal priviledges under the laws of man and of God. \n \n As far as gay marriage not being a benefit to society, you would have to tell me why gay marriage would not benefit society before I can dispute you. I do not see in any way how it could possibly harm society. Quite the contrary, in my opinion. Marriage encourages a commitment to monogomy...which benefits society in any situation.\n \n Lilac",
