However, before you get all high and mighty, answer me a few questions:\n \n 1 - If your wife (Or similar loved one) and a known serial killer/rapist are both drowning, and you can only save one, who will it be?\n \n 2 - Did you ever have a loved pet (A puppy or a kitten, or something)?

If you would rather save your wife or loved one than a rapist or serial killer, then you obviously believe that your wife is more important. Or at least more important to you. Which means to a certain extent you have made a value judgement on the other person, and determined that their value is less than your wifes.\n \n The second question is similar. I cried when my pets had to be put down, I surely did. I loved them dearly, and it was hard to see them go. However, when the Iranian earthquake hit, I was slightly despondent for a few minutes, then I changed the channel and watched the simpsons. Those people meant nothing to me, and apart from a breif pang of empathic sympathy, I did not care for their loss. In fact, very few people did. If you honestly value each life equally, then you must mourn each passing life equally also. Each murder, each accident victim, all across the globe. Would you mourn if your parents died? What about if four people in China were killed by a falling tree and you heard it on the news? Would you feel twice as bad?

I value people for other reasons also.\n\n \n Really, you stated a bit earlier, \"I am saying I get to decide how valuable I think people are. \" and then , \"I am saying that I see no reason to believe that an objective value for humans exists.\" and again, \"the only value that people have is that set by their peers. It is subjective, not objective.\"\n \n If you get to decide, and there is no \"objective\" value then you would have to decide based on what they can do for you. If, for you, people only have what value YOU put on them, then YOU are the center of your universe, and people would necessarily have a utilitarian purpose.\n \n Do you see my point?",

   "\"If it does not have a tangible, measurable and comparable substance, then it exists solely in the realm of thought and opinion, which is purely subjective.\" -Adept\n \n That is a self-refuting statement. You cannot create your own absolute truth in order to argue that there are none. If everything (non-physical) is subjective, then why are you arguing? Why do you speak at all if everything you say is subjective?\n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Very well.\n \n If it does not have a tangible, measurable and comparable substance, then  all the evidence curently available to us indicates that it exists solely in the realm of thought and opinion, which is purely subjective. There is currently no evidence to the contrary.\n \n Bits in bold added for technical correctness. Happy now?\n \n With regards to motivation in terms of subjectivity: Why not? I am arguing because it pleases me to do so. I speak because it pleases me to do so. Or the alternatives are less pleasing, whatever. I do this, because of all the available options, this one is the one I am best pleased with.",
