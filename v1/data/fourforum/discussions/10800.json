   "I put little faith in a book written by the hands of man claiming to be spoken to by god, but I have studied historical facts of the bible peope lseem to ignore.\n \n THe bible is a collection of boos and stories, not a single word. COlelcted over a very long period of time.\n \n BOoks reflecting Homosecuality were added durign a time when it waqs beign persucuted. Seems when ther is an issue, its then the holy word.\n \n orginal tablets did not contain this info. As a matter of fact 2 men were blessed ofr their love for each other, . Bible readers, cna you find the scripture form the old testiment and read the new kings james and see how all the owrds were changed?\n \n There is no one bible. THe name of god was removed in modern bibles. THat is a disrepect to god (yawe, Jehova, allye, allah, what ever language you choose to say it in).\n \n We can pick up 5 differnt bibles with 5 differnt wordings, altered scripts, cahnged meanings, yet this is ok? Evidence how the WORD OF GOD, has been and continues to be changed.\n \n Yes I'm gay, yes I believe in god, but I don't believe in the altered lies I was fed.\n \n So for soem of the christians here. That stand against somone that is gay searchign for equal rights in a gov that sperates church and state................\n \n \n You msut now follow the bible word ofr word....\n \n YOU MUST ACCEPT SLAVERY!\n \n THat is correct. THE bible and god allows and cadones slaves. DOn't give me yoru equal rights speach, you follow the bible, gays are wrong. SLavery and slaves are right. ( I find this disgusting).\n \n Women!!! YOu msut server yoru husband! Be submissive to him adn his word!!!! YOu are below yoru husband!!! YOu are not equal to him in his household! ( DO you accept this?) THe bible tells you what he may do to you.\n \n Devorce is wrong. Unless she comits adultry and is to be stoned t0 death, and by the word of god, STONE HER! You may nto devorce her unless this be!\n \n THink of all the stuff in the bible. THink hard about it, and tell me that a god of love, a god of mercy put these words to scripture.\n \n SO don't dare state Gay Marirage is wrong, nor gay addopton, unless you start livign by the above examples. Otherwise you are not a christian followign the word of god. Or is it the decided word of god by the hand of man?",

   "Amazing how the anti-gay/christian fanatics avoid these facts.\n \n I was in a round table debate in NYC. Presented 46 pages of cross referenced information. I actaully asked anti-gay religiosu leaders simpel queestions, none of them could argue. Two of them were so fustrated and lost for words they had to leave. Some eyes were opened that day, and a few questioned their religion themselves.\n \n I think it is simply to much for them when someone is extremly educated in biblical studies, even more then themselves. WHen you can provide evidence on changes to the bibile, orginal texts found, and when boosk were written from hystorical data and digs. They loose faith themselves.\n \n Each tiem they fabricated lies, I caught it, proved it wrong. As they dig their hole deeper, tehy becoem lost for words. THen liek most religious fanatics, they avoid it.",
