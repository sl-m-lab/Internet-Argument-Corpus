   "On the face of it, enlarging the taxpaying base by allowing an increase in immigration looks like a bit of a solution to the problem. It might be, if we could suppose that the extra population would find jobs that, on average, paid enough to leave a surplus (after taxes and living expenses) to invest in a pension scheme. Even without the social/cultural problems of absorbing a lot more immigrants, is there an economic justification for a big boost in the number of people who want to settle in Britain ? If an increase in population eventually led to an increase in the number of people on social security benefits, the pensions problem would be made worse.\n\n \n Oh, I 100% agree Alan, I kind of touched on it when I said --\n \n \"or we start bringing in measures to increase the (tax paying) population.\"\n \n But yes if the jobs aren't there,or the skills aren't there (or both) then immigration could add to the problem.\n \n \nThe only thing I can think of that would actually begin solving the problem and be politically possible would be for medical advances that reduce the problems of old age so that you can take a large section of retirees out of retirement thus reducing the need for pensions whilst providing more tax to take care of the rest (especially since older people will be among the higher earners).\n\n \n Or a country/world spanning catastrophic event which causes a dramatic population decrease (old & young), and a regression of 'life styles'.\n \n \nCourse if this will probably fall down as pretty soon you'll just end up with an older retired population living to an even greater age but you might get to a point where the percentage of the population working is large enough to support the retired one, course on the other, other hand, a much older population and workforce is going to put even more strain on the NHS.\n\n \n Not only that if the dependents (e.g. pensioners) become the majority (and are mobilised to vote together) they could democratically 'enslave' (sorry for being provocative) the minority tax paying workforce.\n \n Indeed, I wonder what life increasing drugs could be brought onto the NHS if the proposed above majority desired to push for it...?\n \n \nCurrently in the UK we are lacking a massive amount of skilled labour such as plumbers and electricians that could easily be taught over a few weeks/months whilst they are being processed.\n\n \n You can become a certified plumber/electrician in a matter of months? emoticon_wow \n \n I dunno, I know you're just throwing ideas 'out there' so to speak but this sort of thing worries me.\n \n You don't want IMHO to start generating a 'underclass' of jobs where by you have say 'electricians' and you have 'immigrant-electricians'.\n \n This kind of just links in with my feeling about this country where by people already scorn 'manual labour' jobs skilled or otherwise -- I think our 'culture' has a lot to blame for our skill shortages both in the way we view said people and the way we encourage others to learn the skills required (i.e. lack of vocational education in schools).\n \n Personally, I've heard there are so many people training to become said plumbers and electricians that eventually there will be 'too many' (yeah, \"we'll see\" ;) ) -- it's just we're in the gap before they become fully qualified and 'set up'.\n \n \nso you are saying that this is unlikely to happen in Brittain?\n\n \n It's amusing for me to witness someone say (write) that without being sarcastic.",

   "@ BB Scot\n \n Hopefully, that debt has been used to increase the individual productivity of the worker participating in higher education. While this is far from certain, at first glance this appears to be true.\n \n If we do assume that higher education generally leads to higher productivity, and this higher productivity outweighs the monetary and opportunity costs for the investment (tuition fees, school books, lost years of employment etc, etc), the increased prevalence of higher education is not a problem at all.\n \n It is also important to note that jobs requiring academic skills are much less physicly straining and makes it possible to work longer than the jobs that \"only\" require manual skills.\n \n \n \n You assume that all those who go to University will get a job that will pay over the national average, this will then allow that person to contribute more to their future pension.\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3554468.stm \n \n Its also the sheer scale of the debt that students end up with some reports say on average about \u00a313,000.

I`m asuming that on average, those who go to university will get a job that will pay significantly more than the national average ;).\n \n In Sweden, the premium for higher education is about 4% (that is; on average, an individual with a higher education will earn 4% more throughout his/her lifetime than the average for non-academic workers (opportunity cost for education and student loans included in the premium)). The problem is though that the premium does not necessarily mean that the higher education will make workers with academic skills 4% more productive. Just that they will earn 4% more.\n \n \nIts also the sheer scale of the debt that students end up with some reports say on average about \u00a313,000.

But if they earn more, they can save more throughout their lifetime (as well as consume more, which will create more jobs, pay more taxes which can be used for public consumtion or investment, etc).",
