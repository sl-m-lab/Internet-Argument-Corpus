Though promises of switching Iraq folly costs for domestic health care would certainly get the attention of most voters.\n\n \n \n I don't know. I think that it depends on how such things are sold to the US public. As far as whether or not the auto industry is big enough to cause a perceptual change, I would say certainly so. We were just sold bankruptcy law modifications based on the image of millionaires hiding millions in assets, and a poor, broke medical system being preyed upon by affluent people who are just looking for a way to cheat them out of p[aying their bill.\n \n In the real world, we know that both things do sometimes happen. We also know that 99.97% of the time, bankruptcies are not diabolical tools of millionaires, but rather the last desperate option of people who are overrun with debt. \n \n BUT, now, the 99.5% of people who use it as it was meant to be used are screwed, because the US public actually bought the image of the .5% that was being sold.\n \n I do think that national health care is a pie in the sky kind of thing now simply becuase we cannot afford it. Other debts are coming due, and we are still having trouble moving our bonds, even at a rate higher than that of canadian bonds. \n \n I got my weekly financial update from my briokerage on friday, and it shows consumer confidence numbers down another 2 points. IF that is the trend, the drop in price for commodities that are essentially based on consumer confidence (i.e housing, equity markets, etc...) will almost certainly be dramatic. \n \n When you consider the tax income that such things provide, it quickly becomes apparent that losses in these areas would be crippling to our government, especially when you consider the already outstanding national debt we have.",
