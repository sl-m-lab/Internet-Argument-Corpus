   "Meldinoor over at EvC had a good thread about if there was no bible, could we find evidence for YEC? \n \n I'm interested in what you guys think. Without Genesis to guide Creationists in hunting for evidence, what evidence with no knowledge of Genesis could be used to argue for a young earth? What geological evidence, by itself, without anything else suggests the Earth is young?",

   "I thought this was fairly accepted?\n \n See: the reasoning behind the first part of my argument here\n\n \n Given Arch's reply, it does appear they have absolutely nothing. That without the Bible, they cannot provide evidence. That does also appear to be the same conclusion that Meldinoor's thread lead to.\n \n \nSee also the implications of this article. To summarise it: 'any empirical interpretations of reality = fallable, whereas Ken Ham's Bilblical Literalism = infallable. Which would you bet on?'\n[/quote]\n \n I always found it interesting how creationists can deny radioactive dating and yet still use nuclear power when both are founded on the same principles. \n \n How are tangible products fallible derived from empirical interpretations of reality? That doesn't make sense. But neither does Creationism",
