   "From Salon (The Broad Sheet):\n \n Honor killings in the liberated Iraq\n On Wednesday's \"All Things Considered,\" NPR correspondent Anne Garrels had a heart-rending and infuriating story out of Baghdad on the Iraqi tribal practice of \"honor killing.\" In this medieval tradition, families who suspect that a woman among them has had sex outside of marriage -- even if she was raped -- feel honor-bound to murder her in order to save the family from disgrace. Killing a rape victim in order to preserve one's honor may sound backward to you -- as backward, say, as invading a country where there are no terrorists and then claiming you've got to stay and keep fighting because the terrorists now see the place as a central front in their war with you. Welcome to Iraq! \n \n Garrels tells the story of Fatima, a 16-year-old who was kidnapped by unidentified assailants in West Baghdad. The kidnappers threatened to rape and kill Fatima unless her brother quit the Iraqi police force. He did, and Fatima was released, but not, Garrels says, into safety. The mere possibility that she might have been raped was enough to seal her fate. Her family couldn't live with that kind of disgrace, and in order to preserve their honor, her cousin Sarhan shot her. \n \n Sarhan, who speaks freely and with seemingly no remorse to Garrels, is a piece of work. Listen to her report just to hear his chilling quotes: \"She knew the customs, but I don't think she expected we would kill her,\" he tells Garrels. \"She was crying. I saw in her eyes that she thought we would take her in our arms and say, 'Thank god you are safe.' But she got bullets instead.\" \n \n Sarhan, a law school graduate who works as a traffic cop in the newly liberated Iraq, concedes that his actions weren't sanctioned by religion. But tribal customs require such killings, he says. \"The traditions of the tribe are even stronger than religion,\" he says. \"Islam forbids this, but our culture runs deep.\" To let Fatima live would have been a \"catastrophe,\" he says. \"Her life would have been hell... Her father could not raise his head in front of people. Our entire family would be destroyed.\" \n \n Violence against women is just a part of life in Iraq, Sarhan says. He even admits to beating his wife with a rubber hose. \"It's part of the tradition and the tribes.\" \n \n NPR received many letters in response to its Garrels' report, and the ones it aired on Thursday evening go far toward describing the barbarity of the situation. The brutality, one listener wrote, \"seems to reach deep beyond the heart and into the soul, where it remains like a persistent aching sorrow.\" Another said, \"I found the story so chilling that I felt physically ill. It is hard to imagine a culture where men have such a twisted, cruel sense of power over women that they can murder without any worry of consequences. There is no honor in any country that would allow this treatment of its women.\" \n \n And then there was this letter, which expressed something like hope. \"How do we reconcile the fact that we are delivering aid, security and infrastructure to that part of the world, to those who to those who unabashedly kill and brutalize their girls, women and wives as a matter of traditional culture?\" the listener asked. \"The fact that these Iraqi values are utterly irreconcilable and absolutely contrary to American values should be the primary reason for why we are there. And we should fight to change and destroy the traditions of repulsive tribal morality.\" \n \n But as Garrels' report pointed out, the large and costly American presence in Iraq is not actually doing anything to save the women there. Women's rights groups say that the new Iraqi constitution allows more repression over women than the old, Saddam government did. And do we hear American officials -- the president and his wife, who so frequently invoke women's suffering in Iraq and Afghanistan before we invaded those nations -- call on Iraqis to crack down on barbaric practices now? Not at all. \n \n As Sarhan sees it, nothing will change these Iraqi customs. \"It's a matter of generations,\" he says. \"It's in our blood, custom and traditions.\" \n \n Farhad Manjoo",

Some Arabs regard it as their right under both tradition and sharia (by the process of al-urf), though this contradicts the views of the vast majority of Islamic scholars (fuqaha). Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of Iran has condemned the practice as \"un-Islamic\", though the punishment under Iranian law remains lenient. In Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country, honor killings are unknown, as also in Muslim parts of West Africa.

   "From Salon:\n \n Sharia law means more suffering for female tsunami victims\n With the one-year anniversary of the South Asian tsunami fast approaching, we'd like to thank Feministing for pointing out this troubling story from today's Times of London. Nick Meo reports that some of Indonesia's Islamic extremists are calling the tsunami not an act of nature but, rather, a divine act of revenge for women's \"wicked ways\" -- and are taking advantage of survivors' fears in order to further humiliate and abuse local women under sharia law. \n \n Fatimah Syam, of Indonesian Women for Legal Justice, tells Meo that a \"control team\" of sharia enforcers \"seeks out women without headscarves or unmarried girls meeting boys in private and parades them through the streets in an open car.\" \"I've seen the police laughing and boasting, and the girls in tears,\" she explains. \"[They] say the tsunami happened because women ignored religion. We never heard of this parading before the tsunami.\" \n \n Other women have been violently arrested, had their hair chopped off and been dragged through the streets while their alleged sins were shouted from a megaphone. According to the Times, \"more than 100 gamblers and drinkers -- men and women -- have been caned in public and some clerics are calling for thieves' hands to be amputated.\" \n \n Meo also relays the story of 12-year-old Sheila Mentari, who won her country's version of \"American Idol\" by singing a song about \"how God sent the wave as punishment for sin.\" Mentari believes that her father, who was killed in the tsunami, would have approved of her performance. \n \n Marzuki Lidan, whose wife and children died in the disaster, tells Meo he thinks the sharia \"police are good Muslims doing an excellent job.\" \"We must listen to them and follow God's rules,\" he explains. \"Otherwise the tsunami will happen again.\" \n \n From the relative comfort of our mostly Judeo-Christian country, it might be tempting to shake our heads in condescension and chalk it all up to Muslim fanaticism, but it's worth remembering that these attitudes -- no matter how repugnant and shocking we find them -- are as old as Eve. \n \n -- Sarah Karnasiewicz",

Bibi looked helplessly on from the corner of the room as he then killed the three girls - Bano, 8, Sumaira, 7, and Humaira, 4 - pausing between the slayings to brandish the bloodstained knife at his wife, warning her not to intervene or raise alarm.\n \n \"I was shivering with fear. I did not know how to save my daughters,\" Bibi, sobbing, told AP by phone from the village. \"I begged my husband to spare my daughters but he said, 'If you make a noise, I will kill you.'\"\n \n \"The whole night the bodies of my daughters lay in front of me,\" she said.\n \n The next morning, Ahmed was arrested.\n \n Speaking to AP in the back of police pickup truck late Tuesday as he was shifted to a prison in the city of Multan, Ahmed showed no contrition. Appearing disheveled but composed, he said he killed Muqadas because she had committed adultery, and his daughters because he didn't want them to do the same when they grew up.\n \n He said he bought a butcher's knife and a machete after midday prayers on Friday and hid them in the house where he carried out the killings.\n \n \"I thought the younger girls would do what their eldest sister had done, so they should be eliminated,\" he said, his hands cuffed, his face unshaven. \"We are poor people and we have nothing else to protect but our honor.\"\n \n Despite Ahmed's contention that Muqadas had committed adultery - a claim made by her husband - the rights commission reported that according to local people, Muqadas had fled her husband because he had abused her and forced her to work in a brick-making factory.\n \n Police have said they do not know the identity or whereabouts of Muqadas' alleged lover.\n \n Muqadas was Bibi's daughter by her first marriage to Ahmed's brother, who died 14 years ago.

   "In truth, they do, from Salon:\n \n Prostitute patrons fight sex trafficking in Turkey\n The Independent has an interesting story today about the latest front in fighting sex trafficking in Turkey: brothel customers. \n \n In May, the UN Organization for Migration set up a hotline, staffed by multilingual operators, for women who have been forced into sexual slavery to call for help. But rather than hearing from desperate women, the operators are hearing from men -- Turkish men, who want to pay for willing prostitutes rather than reluctant ones. In fact, 74% of calls to the hotline have been from men; and in the past six months, more than 100 women have been rescued, and Turkish police have broken up 10 sex trafficking rings. \n \n \"I've been very surprised,\" Marielle Lindstrom, head of the IOM in Turkey, told the Independent. \"We haven't noticed this anywhere in Europe. Turkish men seem to have an old-fashioned view of women. They don't mind using prostitutes, but they want the woman to be doing this willingly. If she's found not to be doing it willingly...it affects their pride.\" -- Hillary Frey",

   "In truth, they do, from Salon:\n \n Prostitute patrons fight sex trafficking in Turkey\n The Independent has an interesting story today about the latest front in fighting sex trafficking in Turkey: brothel customers. \n \n In May, the UN Organization for Migration set up a hotline, staffed by multilingual operators, for women who have been forced into sexual slavery to call for help. But rather than hearing from desperate women, the operators are hearing from men -- Turkish men, who want to pay for willing prostitutes rather than reluctant ones. In fact, 74% of calls to the hotline have been from men; and in the past six months, more than 100 women have been rescued, and Turkish police have broken up 10 sex trafficking rings. \n \n \"I've been very surprised,\" Marielle Lindstrom, head of the IOM in Turkey, told the Independent. \"We haven't noticed this anywhere in Europe. Turkish men seem to have an old-fashioned view of women. They don't mind using prostitutes, but they want the woman to be doing this willingly. If she's found not to be doing it willingly...it affects their pride.\" -- Hillary Frey\n\n \n \n Here is an article about it that isn't from a subscription site.\n \n http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article335345.ece",
