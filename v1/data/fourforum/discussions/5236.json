   "I can see the church's point - it's an organization with membership requirements and if you're not willing to follow those requirements, then you're in the wrong organization.\n\n I think you are right.\n \n The requirements for Communion:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Who_Can_Receive_Communion.asp\n \n\n The Church sets out specific guidelines regarding how we should prepare ourselves to receive the Lord's body and blood in Communion. To receive Communion worthily, you must be in a state of grace, have made a good confession since your last mortal sin, believe in transubstantiation, observe the Eucharistic fast, and, finally, not be under an ecclesiastical censure such as excommunication.\n \n First, you must be in a state of grace. \"Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup\" (1 Cor. 11:27-28). This is an absolute requirement which can never be dispensed. To receive the Eucharist without sanctifying grace in your soul profanes the Eucharist in the most grievous manner.\n \n A mortal sin is any sin whose matter is grave and which has been committed willfully and with knowledge of its seriousness. Grave matter includes, but is not limited to, murder, receiving or participating in an abortion, homosexual acts, having sexual intercourse outside of marriage or in an invalid marriage, and deliberately engaging in impure thoughts (Matt. 5:28-29). Scripture contains lists of mortal sins (for example, 1 Cor. 6:9-10 and Gal. 5:19-21). For further information on what constitutes a mortal sin, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church.\n \n Out of habit and out of fear of what those around them will think if they do not receive Communion, some Catholics, in a state of mortal sin, choose to go forward and offend God rather than stay in the pew while others receive the Eucharist. The Church's ancient teaching on this particular matter is expressed in the Didache, an early Christian document written around A.D. 70, which states: \"Whosoever is holy [i.e., in a state of sanctifying grace], let him approach. Whosoever is not, let him repent\" (Didache 10).\n \n Second, you must have been to confession since your last mortal sin. The Didache witnesses to this practice of the early Church. \"But first make confession of your faults, so that your sacrifice may be a pure one\" (Didache 14).\n \n The 1983 Code of Canon Law indicates that the same requirement applies today. \"A person who is conscious of a grave sin is not to . . . receive the body of the Lord without prior sacramental confession unless a grave reason is present and there is no opportunity of confessing; in this case the person is to be mindful of the obligation to make an act of perfect contrition, including the intention of confessing as soon as possible\" (CIC 916).\n \n The requirement for sacramental confession can be dispensed if four conditions are fulfilled: (1) there must be a grave reason to receive Communion (for example, danger of death), (2) it must be physically or morally impossible to go to confession first, (3) the person must already be in a state of grace through perfect contrition, and (4) he must resolve to go to confession as soon as possible.\n \n Third, you must believe in the doctrine of transubstantiation. \"For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself\" (1 Cor. 11:29). Transubstantiation means more than the Real Presence. According to transubstantiation, the bread and wine are actually transformed into the actual body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ, with only the appearances of bread and wine remaining. This is why, at the Last Supper, Jesus held what appeared to be bread and wine, yet said: \"This is my body. . . . This is my blood\" (Mark 14:22-24, cf. Luke 22:14-20). If Christ were merely present along side bread and wine, he would have said \"This contains my body. . . . This contains my blood,\" which he did not say.\n \n Fourth, you must observe the Eucharistic fast. Canon law states, \"One who is to receive the most Holy Eucharist is to abstain from any food or drink, with the exception only of water and medicine, for at least the period of one hour before Holy Communion\" (CIC 919 \u00a71). Elderly people, those who are ill, and their caretakers are excused from the Eucharistic fast (CIC 191 \u00a73). Priests and deacons may not dispense one obligated by the Eucharistic fast unless the bishop has expressly granted such power to them (cf. CIC 89).\n \n Finally, one must not be under an ecclesiastical censure. Canon law mandates, \"Those who are excommunicated or interdicted after the imposition or declaration of the penalty and others who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to Holy Communion\" (CIC 915).\n \n Provided they are in a state of grace and have met the above requirements, Catholics should receive the Eucharist frequently (cic 898).\n",

The Catholic Church, according to what I understand of it, draws a distinction between a person and their behaviour such that there homosexual people and homosexual acts. \n \n According to my understanding the Church officially regards homosexual people as poor defective wretches who deserve our support and compassion. \n \n Homosexual acts, apparently, are the evil things that defile whoever practices them, the sins which distance someone from God. \n \n Unless forgiveness is sought for these mortal sins, the person is held to be responsible for the commission of those sins. \n \n Given that from the official Catholic perspective the unrepented sinners were getting what they deserved at the hands of traditional secular bigotry, it's no wonder that it seemed like it was condoning the violence - especially if people read condemnation of the violence as support for whomever person was assaulted and whatever sins they might be known for. \n \n It's hard to defend those that you consider wicked and unrepentant, and given the difficulties in transmitting complex theological concerns to the laity, it's no wonder that the Catholic Church failed to defend homosexuals. \n \n \nAn organization like the one you describe would be a dead fossil.\n No, not necessarily. The Catholic (the Universal) Church is still very much alive and kicking. In order for it to be necessarily dead, the Church would have to resist all attack and change, rather than the mere perception of it.

Whether those reforms were an attack on the Church is debatable, but it's reasonably sure that it was not regarded as an attack when it was permitted.",

The Catholic Church, according to what I understand of it, draws a distinction between a person and their behaviour such that there homosexual people and homosexual acts. \n \n According to my understanding the Church officially regards homosexual people as poor defective wretches who deserve our support and compassion. \n \n Homosexual acts, apparently, are the evil things that defile whoever practices them, the sins which distance someone from God. \n \n Unless forgiveness is sought for these mortal sins, the person is held to be responsible for the commission of those sins. \n \n Given that from the official Catholic perspective the unrepented sinners were getting what they deserved at the hands of traditional secular bigotry, it's no wonder that it seemed like it was condoning the violence - especially if people read condemnation of the violence as support for whomever person was assaulted and whatever sins they might be known for. \n \n It's hard to defend those that you consider wicked and unrepentant, and given the difficulties in transmitting complex theological concerns to the laity, it's no wonder that the Catholic Church failed to defend homosexuals. \n\n \n I probably agree with much of what you're saying, though I would point out two things. \n \n For a long, long time the Church determined law. It's not that they failed to defend homosexuals... they actively, consciously persecuted us.\n \n Today, despite only \"hating the sin\", the Church calls for opposition to gay-rights laws, even those covering discrimination in the workplace. Now, I can understand why, since they want nothing to encourage gay people to live as gay people, but I have trouble seeing efforts like those as not \"hating the sinner\".\n \n \nNo, not necessarily. The Catholic (the Universal) Church is still very much alive and kicking. In order for it to be necessarily dead, the Church would have to resist all attack and change, rather than the mere perception of it. The reforms made in the Church in response to the Protestant Reformation amount to a Catholic reformation, and stand as an example of change within the Catholic Church. Whether those reforms were an attack on the Church is debatable, but it's reasonably sure that it was not regarded as an attack when it was permitted.\n\n \n I guess I'm confused. I thought you were suggesting that excluding dissent was something the Church should do. As for regarding something as \"an attack\"... in the cases you mention, I'm sure the side that eventually lost saw the reforms as \"an attack\".",

As I haven't done so in nearly 2 decades, I have no problems personally abstaining from communion. I believe the common saying before communion is 'Lord, although I am unworthy to receive you, just say the word and I shall be healed.' Which recognises that you haven't made proper confession and are 'unworthy'.\n \n And in the case we're discussing, the frickin priest DID bless them. There was no smuggness like some protestors desire to see and portray. It's simply following current church doctrine that if you engage in a sin (according to the church) or support those who engage in sin, then you really don't have your religious head screwed on straight.\n I think the church is fairly lax in it's 'persecutions.' Not too long ago, they'd have excommunicated you. And a little further back, organized some people to harrase you. And further back...kill you and take your stuff.\n Some church officials even had issue with Kerry in his abortion supporting stance IIRC.\n \n \n I support equality for gays.\n And, while they can marry the same people a heterosexual does, the fact that heterosexuals are free to chose someone they're attracted to plays a role in my siding with marriage and legal rights that are shared by all americans being afforded to them.",

Thanks for the \"out of context sermon.\"\n \n Matt 18: 15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. 16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. 17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.  18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\n \n The word \"repent\" is missing (among many other things) from your out of context sermon since that is what is needed to obtain forgiveness.\n \n Acts 2: 37 And hearing, they were stabbed in the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Men, brothers, What shall we do? 38 And Peter said to them, Repent and be baptized, each of you on the name of Jesus Christ to remission of sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all those afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call. 40 And with many other words he earnestly testified and exhorted, saying, Be saved from this perverse generation.",

   "At least until another gay rights person throws the thread off topic again.\n Maybe if we agreed on what topic this was about, and what related topics are relevant?\n \nIt's interesting that inevitably when there are certain gay rights supporters here weighing in, it seems these threads tend to degrade into crude discussions about sexual acts with all the unneccessary details. I wonder how well the moderators of this forum are aware that some here keep trying to drag the forum down to the level of porn.\n Yeah, I'm rather uncomfortably with the way that Voice of Reason obsesses over Justine's sex life, sexually harrasses her, and continually reduces gay sexuality to sex acts. \n \n The discussion of sexual acts seem to be straightforward, as that seems to be the root of the religious objection to homosexuality - relevant in this case in how the Catholic Church treats behaviour it considers sinful. If you're going to make moral claims about sex acts, it seems reasonable to analyse those acts in order to try and figure out what it is that makes them sinful. \n \n \nThere is a small sect of militant gays that are pushing the gay marriage issue.\n Really? I've never been described as 'militant' before. What is it that qualifies someone as militant? \n \nActually the gay marriage issue is just a red herring..The real gay agenda is to stuff the gay lifestyle down our throats and try and force us to accept it as a suitable alternate lifestyle.\n I'm confused.

I always thought that gay-identified sexualities constituted less than 10% of the population. That certainly sounds like a minority. Mind you, if you guys didn't have such a problem with it, the minority status would disappear as gays get absorbed back into the mainstream. \n \nTo teach our children in schools that the sex acts they engage in are the norm.\n I'm confused.

Are gays are minority? What numbers justify such claims?\n \n 4. When you refer to \"norms\", do you mean \"norm\" as in \"social norm for homosexuals\" or do you mean \"social norm for heterosexuals\" or do you mean \"social norm for homosexuals and heterosexuals altogether\"?\n \n 5.

Don't worry - this is just your brain functioning normally. \n \n2. The gay lifestyle make up people who are gay and how they practice sex...\n So the gay lifestyle is just about being gay?

I don't pray to the FALSE GOD OF WAR, nor is the military a GOD to be thanked in any way, shape or form. \n \n 5. You haven't got a clue as to my religious or spiritual beliefs, do not even try to assume you do. You'll be wrong....as usual.\n \n 6. Do not judge me nor tell me how or what to pray to, that is NOT your business.",
