Some laws are created to protect certain interest groups, and some laws are a compromise as a result of negotiations between different power sources. Some laws are good for some, yet bad for others. For example, there was a time when the law allowed the tobacco companies to advertise their products. Those laws have since changed to protect the victims of tobacco instead.

   "Thank you, though I'm not sure congratulations are in order. It wasn't anything particularly insightful or intellectual. Very basic logic really.\n \n Read your statement carefully and break it down. It was not out of context, you even defended it, as is, in a subsequent post. The premise cannot be proven, the inverse - \"there is no proof otherwise\" does not work as proof. Further to that, no matter how you analyze it, A therefore B does not follow logically.\n \n At any rate, I likely won't even get onto the board again for a couple weeks. I'll be interested to see where the thread has gone in the mean time.\n \n Waxy\n\n \n I see your point. You are quite correct that no proof otherwise does not mean proof. However, there is an abundance of evidence pointing to it. I may not prove it conclusively, but I certainly prove the likelihood. The evidence supports that man has always known some concept of good and evil. \n \n EF",
