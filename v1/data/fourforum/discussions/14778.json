   "In what could be the first step towards same-sex couples having their own genetic children, reproductive scientists have produced male and female mice from two fathers using stem cell technology. The achievement of two-father offspring in a species of mammal could also be a step toward preserving endangered species, improving livestock breeds, and advancing human assisted reproductive technology (ART).\n\n \n Breakthrough raises possibility of genetic children for same-sex couples",

   "Sounds like a way for medical research companies to get wealthy. Parenting has little to do with biology. Biology only creates a child, parenting takes a great deal more.\n \n My son's biological father walked when he was three. My son's adopted father has been there for loving, disciplining, homework, teacher conferences, ball games, doctors appointments, sleepless nights, etc.\n \n If anyone asks who my son's REAL father is - guess what my answer is.\n \n Children are usually fairly easily created and there are plenty of them who need love. When they all have homes, maybe I will find efforts like this anything but wasteful. I feel the same way about infertile couples. \n \n There is a high risk kid accross the street who is practically mine. I WILL make sure he makes it to college. I have two neices, but only one is actually my neice technically, I love them both.\n \n This is stupid. People are dieing of cancer. We do not need to find new ways to make babies. The current method works just fine.\n \n And just for anyone who does not know. I fully support gay rights, gay marriage and my son's REAL dad is gay.",
