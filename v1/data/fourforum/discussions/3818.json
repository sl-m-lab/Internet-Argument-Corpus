   "God&#8217;s Self-Disclosure\n \n Think for a moment about someone in your life that you&#8217;re very close to, someone that you know well and that in turn knows you well. Now what is it that makes your relationship a close one? I would suggest that what makes our best relationships so good is self-disclosure; that is, we have willingly offered something of ourselves, whether it be our struggles or our passions, that helps another person to know who we are. We have revealed, if you like, a part of who and what we are.\n \n Without self-disclosure, a relationship can only go so far. If a person doesn&#8217;t disclose who he is, you&#8217;ll never truly know him. And it works the other way around also. If you don&#8217;t disclose who you are, then others can&#8217;t really know you. \n \n When it comes to knowing and relating to God, does the element of self-disclosure have a role, even with us today? You can be sure it does. Think about this with me for a moment.\n \n First, God discloses Himself in the universe around us. We see that mentioned in Psalm 19 and Romans 1. Just think about the beauty you see in a sunset, or the wonder of the stars, or the smile on the face of someone you love. Better still, think of the complexity God has built into the universe: everything from DNA exhibiting the precise design of living creatures, to the exact tilt and orbit of the earth such that life might exist here. The very environment that we live in every day is an element of God&#8217;s self-disclosure. It speaks loudly of His intelligence and power. As Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote, \"The earth is charged with the grandeur of God.&#8221;\n \n God also discloses more of Himself through the sacred writings of the Bible. In the Bible, we find a clear disclosure of God, what He&#8217;s like, and at least part of His own personal story. We find there a God who loves human beings so much that He sent his Son Jesus&#8212;the exact representation of God&#8212;to experience life as a human being, even to the point of dying a cruel death. In the Bible we can read clearly about God and His ways, as He works to win the hearts of people again and again.\n \n God is also willing to disclose Himself to each of us individually. He offers a personal relationship to us through Jesus; a relationship that involves us as individuals with our distinct personalities. This would be the most intimate disclosure of God to us. God says in the book of Jeremiah, &#8220;You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.&#8221; So God has promised us: If we seek Him honestly, we will find Him; He will disclose Himself to us.\n \n In His world, in His Word, and in our individual lives, God is constantly disclosing Himself. An invitation can be accepted or rejected. The Psalmist enjoins us, &#8220;Taste and see that the LORD is good.&#8221;\n \n Source: By Stuart McAllister",

   "I can't decide where this post is suited best, so I will duplicate this over here as well. :-)\n \n Cosmic Humanists talk about god, so they must practice a religion. \n \n But how can the &#8220;religious&#8221; label apply to atheists like the Marxists or Secular Humanists?\n \n It applies because all worldviews contain a theology&#8212;that is, all begin with a religious declaration. Christianity begins with &#8220;In the beginning God.&#8221; Marxism/Leninism and Secular Humanism begin with &#8220;In the beginning no God.&#8221; Cosmic Humanism begins with the declaration &#8220;Everything is God.&#8221;\n \n The Marxist view demonstrates itself to be religious in a number of other ways, as well. Marxism&#8217;s philosophy of dialectical materialism grants matter god-like attributes, as Gustav A. Wetter acknowledges in Dialectical Materialism:\n [T]he atheism of dialectical materialism is concerned with very much more than a mere denial of God. . . [I]n dialectical materialism . . . the higher is not, as such, denied; the world is interpreted as a process of continual ascent, which fundamentally extends into infinity. But it is supposed to be matter itself which continually attains to higher perfection under its own power, thanks to its indwelling dialectic. As Nikolai Berdyaev very rightly remarks, the dialectical materialist attribution of &#8220;dialectic&#8221; to matter confers on it, not mental attributes only, but even divine ones.\n We will discuss this further in the Marxist philosophy chapter. For now, it is enough to understand that Wetter perceives communism as religious in character.\n \n Even Secular Humanists such as Bertrand Russell recognize the religiosity of Marxism: \n &#8220;The greatest danger in our day comes from new religions, communism and Nazism. To call these religions may perhaps be objectionable both to their friends and to their enemies, but in fact they have all the characteristics of religions. They advocate a way of life on the basis of irrational dogmas; they have a sacred history, a Messiah, and a priesthood. I do not see what more could be demanded to qualify a doctrine as a religion.&#8221;\n \n Source:: Click HERE",

   "Sigmund Freud divided all people into \"believers\" and \"unbelievers.&#8221;\n \n Unbelievers include all those who consider themselves cynics, skeptics, scoffers, agnostics, or atheists. Believers include the rest, whose belief ranges from merely an intellectual assent that someone or something is out there to those like Lewis, Augustine, Tolstoy, and Pascal who have had a life-transforming experience after which their faith becomes the primary motivating and organizing principle of their lives. \n \n Freud came down clearly and strongly against the notion that there is \"Anyone\" out there. He described his worldview as secular and called it \"scientific,\" and he claimed that no source of knowledge of the universe exists other than \"carefully scrutinized observation what we call research.\" Therefore no knowledge, he said, can be derived from revelation or from intuition. He stated that the notion of the universe created by a being \"resembling a man but magnified in every respect, an idealized superman, reflects the gross ignorance of primitive peoples.\" He stated that no intelligent person could accept the absurdities of the religious worldview. \n \n Freud described the concept of God as merely a projection of the childish wish for the protection of an all-powerful father. He added that \"religion is an attempt to master the sensory world in which we are situated by means of the wishful world which we have developed within us as a result of biological and psychological abnormality.\" \n \n He concluded that the religious view is \"so pathetically absurd and . . . infantile that it is humiliating and embarrassing to think that the majority of people will never rise above it.\" \n \n Except for the brief time as a college student under the influence of a brilliant philosopher named Franz Bratano, a devout believer, when Freud wavered in his atheism, he stated that he remained an unbeliever all of his life. A year before he died, Freud wrote to Charles Sanger, \"Neither in my private life nor in my writing have I ever made a secret of being an out-and-out unbeliever.\" \n \n When we carefully assess the record, however, we find that Freud may not have been quite as adamant in his atheism as he proclaimed. Certainly he did refer to himself often as, \"an infidel Jew,\" and he rejected outright the religious view of the universe, especially the Judeo-Christian view. He certainly attacked this view with all his intellectual might and from every possible perspective. Yet, for some reason he remained preoccupied with these issues; he just could not leave them alone. He spent the last thirty years of his life writing about them. \n \n In an autobiographical study he said that these philosophical and religious issues interested him throughout his life from early youth. A great deal of evidence exists that Freud's worldview proved less than comfortable for him. Faith was by no means a closed issue for him, and he was extremely ambivalent about God's existence. \n \n Anna Freud, Sigmund's daughter who died a few years ago, explained to me the only way to know her father: \"Don't read his biographies;\" she instructed, \"read his letters.\" Throughout Freud's letters are statements such as, \"If someday we meet above,\" \"[my] one, quite secret prayer,\" and statements about God's grace. \n \n During the last thirty years of Freud's life, he carried out a continuous exchange of hundreds of letters with a Swiss theologian, Oskar Phister.\n \n It's interesting to note that his longest correspondence was with this theologian. He admired Phister and wrote, \n \n \"You are a true servant of God . . . [who] feels the need to do spiritual good to everyone he meets. You did good this way even to me.\" He later said that Phister was, \"In the fortunate position of being able to lead men to God.\"\n \n Source:: Click Here\n \n Armand M.

He left no writings, but his teachings have been preserved (with some embellishment) by Plato and others.\n \n In one of his Dialogues, Plato records a conversation between Socrates and Alcibiades. The great philosopher informs Alcibiades that there is a risk in approaching his god in prayer, lest he should be refused and even penalized. He counsels Alcibiades therefore to keep silence and &#8220;wait until we find out how we should behave toward the gods and towards men.&#8221;\n \n When Alcibiades inquired as to how long he must wait, Socrates replied that he must wait until &#8220;he [comes] who takes a special interest in you&#8221; and removes the &#8220;darkness. . . in which your soul is now enveloped. . . Afterwards the means may be given to you whereby you may distinguish between good and evil&#8221;. This passage is remarkable from several vantage points.\n \n First, it confesses there is a manner in which we should behave. Human beings are not free to act merely as they will. They have an intrinsic sense of responsibility.\n \n Second, the philosopher confesses that we wander in a state of darkness in terms of knowing how to behave. Through all the centuries of human history, the moral confusion and ethical depravity of the human family have been painfully obvious.\n \n Third, it acknowledges then the need for instruction as to how men ought to behave. There is the implication that this instruction will be external to man, i.e., an objective body of truth that lies beyond the mere inclinations of his own conscience.\n \n Fourth, Socrates suggests that human beings have a dual obligation - that which is directed towards deity, and that which is obligatory toward one&#8217;s fellow man. The former we would call religious responsibility; the latter we would designate as moral or ethical obligation. It is amazing that so many labor under the illusion that simply being &#8220;good&#8221; to others represents the totality of their spiritual duty.\n \n Fifth, it is clear that this admonition from the famous philosopher is illustrative of the void that was resident in the ancient pagan heart - a longing for release from the heaviness that burdens the soul, and seeks relief from the guilt of wrongdoing.\n \n Finally, the sage of Greece suggested that man&#8217;s ignorance would be remedied only when &#8220;he who takes a special interest in you&#8221; comes. There is the implication that a personal interest in mankind must be evidenced by a higher source.\n \n Perhaps God?",

   "The Bible Provides the Answers to Socrates Questions\n \n In the Bible, the prophets of God repeatedly stressed that without divine revelation, humanity is in a state of &#8220;darkness.&#8221; At the commencement of his preaching ministry Jesus himself emphasized that through his message those who &#8220;sat in darkness&#8221; would be granted the illumination of a &#8220;great light&#8221; (Mt. 4:16). From the Jewish/Hebrew origin: Kitvei ha-Qodesh, in the books of prophetic witness, teaches us that God elected Israel as his covenanted community (keneset yisrael) to be \"a light unto the nations.\" \n \n Because of the Creator&#8217;s deep &#8220;care&#8221; (compassion) for fallen man (cf. Mt. 18:27), he lovingly sent his own Son to teach us how to behave (Jn. 3:2; 14:6).\n \n The Savior&#8217;s instruction was complete, tutoring us as to how we might fulfill our obligation to both God and man. He masterfully summed up the matter with the word &#8220;love&#8221; (agape), which entails the idea of obedience toward God, and service to our fellows (Mt. 22:35-40).\n \n The divine instruction was embodied in a library of sacred literature which found its culmination in the New Testament. When Paul penned his first letter to Timothy, he suggested there is a manner in which &#8220;men ought to behave themselves&#8221; (3:15). The word &#8220;behave&#8221; translates the Greek anastrepho, which literally means &#8220;to turn back.&#8221; Associated with the word, therefore, is the idea of &#8220;return&#8221; (cf. Acts 5:22).\n \n In the larger context of the Scriptures, it has to do with returning to a divine standard of conduct, and a &#8220;manner of life&#8221; consistent therewith (cf. 2 Cor. 1:12; 1 Tim. 4:12).\n \n All of these scriptures would been like a cool drink of water and refreshing to Socrates soul!!!",

   "When you hear the word God, what comes to your mind?\n \n Warm feelings? Theological terms? Confusion? Nothing? No doubt, our reactions are very diverse to this simple word. This diversity of reaction issues, at least partially, from the diversity of definitions of the term. In our pluralistic age there is no generally accepted definition of this incredibly important word. So when someone asks, \"Does God exist?\" it is right to reply, \"What do you mean by God?\" This question is of utmost importance, and so deserves our careful attention. Blithely accepting dogma or anti-dogma on this question serves no one. So allow me to ask this all-important question of you: what does God mean to you? \n \n To Aristotle, the ancient philosopher, God meant the Unmoved mover who is the starting point of the universe. God, for him, was an impersonal force, the eternal hinge about which the universe swings. God then is a postulate and not a person. Is that what God means to you? Is He merely a principle you posit to make your world make more sense?\n \n In stark contrast to Aristotle is the polytheist who believes God to be immanently human, maybe even overly so. Here, God, or the gods, means somebody like you or me except with a lot of power, who also happens to be immortal. I have always felt that this turns the transcendent into either a wish-receptacle or a big-bully in the sky to appease. Is this what God means to you? Is God just a source of power that you worship when you want to get some of his power? Do your sacrifices only aim at currying the favor of God?\n \n Many anthropologists explain away such notions of the divine as mere anthropomorphic projections &#8211; a making of God in human image. \n \n The Bible radically reverses this equation. It states that we, humans, are made in God&#8217;s image. God is not a really big man in the sky. More accurately, we are like little gods here on earth. We are fashioned in his image. We are creative, relational, spiritual, moral, love-seeking, free. In a word, we are persons. This is the fingerprint of the divine in our nature. Yes, the Bible also tells of our Fall, which we see evidence for everyday, but the image of God in us is not completely defaced. \n \n So when you think of God, realize He is not an impersonal force, nor is He just a big guy in the sky. God is a person, the ultimate Person. Open yourself to Him, and He will open Himself to you.\n \n Source:: Click Here",
