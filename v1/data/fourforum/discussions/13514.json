   "Demonstrations for Medicare For All continued across the nation yesterday, with the Kentucky sit-in continuing into its second day, as of the last press report today:\n \n \nIn 11 cities across the country, hundreds of everyday Americans who want Medicare for All confronted the insurance companies and demanded that they redirect the money they&#8217;re spending to control our democracy to pay for the care they deny to their members. Almost every company refused to even talk to us, and 37 people were arrested including doctor Matt Hendrickson at a Cigna office in Glendale, California. Dozens more &#8211; like the 30 people who blockaded the Blue Cross office in San Francisco for hours &#8211; sat in but weren&#8217;t arrested. In Rhode Island, however, the protestors who joined cancer patient Robert Darling in occupying the UnitedHealthcare office won the first concessions of our campaign &#8211; a company representative agreed to give an answer to Robert about paying for his previous bone marrow transplant within 24 hours and to arrange a meeting for the group with the UnitedHealthcare CEO within a week! After 115 arrests in 18 cities, these companies are starting to feel the heat of our movement. And with more than 900 people now signed up to sit-in, this battle is just beginning.\n \n Today, the Mobilization continued in Louisville, Kentucky and Baltimore, Maryland. The brave folks in Louisville are in the 9th hour of their sit-in inside the Humana headquarters as we send out this email. Humana is trying to wait them out, but may are prepared to stay overnight if they have to.\n \n In Baltimore, four people were arrested at a CareFirst (Blue Cross) office including two doctors. One of those doctors, Margaret Flowers of the &#8220;Baucus 8,&#8221; has withheld her name and is planning to stay in jail until the CEO of CareFirst, Chet Burrell, agrees to a public meeting with her. \n \n The Mobilization Spreads &#8211; Doctor Stays In Jail | Mobilization for Health Care for All | Patients not profit!\n\n \n More press coverage @\n \n San Francisco Chronicle:\n Chron Rx Health Blog : Sitting in for health\n \n South Florida Sun-Sentinel\n Two arrested at health insurance protest outside Cigna offices -- South Florida Sun-Sentinel.com\n \n NJ.com (Star-Ledger / Trenton Times / Jersey Journal blog)\n Single-payer health-care advocates are arrested in Newark protesting insurance companies | Bob Braun - NJ.com\n \n projo.com\n (Providence Journal blog):\n Update: Protesters occupy lobby at UnitedHealthcare - Projo 7 to 7 News Blog | Rhode Island news | The Providence Journal\n \n Glendale News-Press:\n Glendale News Press < Archives < News < Glendale protest leads to arrests\n \n National Public Radio, Topics\n Photo from Getty Images - Protesters march outside the entrance to News, photos, topics, and quotes\n \n Democracy Now:\n Democracy Now! | Headlines for October 28, 2009\n \n Free Speech Radio News:\n Activists push to keep public option in health care reform | FSRN\n \n Huffington Post:\n Nine Arrested At WellPoint Insurance Sit-In (PHOTOS)\n \n Institute for Public Accuracy:\n Protests at Insurance Company Offices -- Institute for Public Accuracy (IPA)\n \n Atlas Press Photo:\n ATLASPRESS\n \n La Jornada (Mexico)\n La Jornada: Rebeli\u00f3n ciudadana en EU contra banqueros\n \n OpEdNews (featured story about doctors, by Kevin Gosztola):\n OpEdNews - Article: Doctors Risking Arrest for Healthcare for All, Challenging a System That Makes Doctors Complicit\n \n OpEdNews (about Philadelphia rally):\n OpEdNews - Diary: Remember Mischief Night?

It isn't that government is not involved enough, it is that they are too involved as it is. A health insurance company has no incentive to compete but every incentive to spend millions on lobbying efforts.

How many companies could you have chosen with your employer by the way? How often can you switch? If you car insurance tells you they won't pay a claim how likely are you to continue with them? Think of the two options here. You have car insurance which is as close to free enterprise as we can now get in the US where rates are low, you can switch on a dime, you see lots of companies OR you can get something like Medicare that denies people at a rate equal to or higher than other insurance companies and offers doctors 80% or less on the bills meaning you get worse care. \n \n You are probably right that the health insurance companies are a bunch of a-holes but don't fall for the idea that Obama will save the day.

Look, the health insurance companies, hospitals, and doctors are going to be \"greedy\" like any company would. When the government makes it easier for them to do this than what you get is a health insurance industry that finds it more profitable to convince 400+ people in congress to follow their idea than trying to convince 300 million Americans to buy their BS. If the federal government stayed out of it and just said \"deal with the customer\" than all of a sudden you end up with something like auto insurance. Employer based health care is just a limiting of choice and an indirect pay. It doesn't work and getting the federal government MORE involved will only make things worse for everyone.",
