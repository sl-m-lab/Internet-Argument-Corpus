But at no point in my life have I ever felt compelled to carry or own a gun.\n Since Barack Obama has taken office, gun sales across America have surged. Firearm purchases under a Democratic president appear absolutely recession proof.\n What is this American fixation with firearms? Is it similar to the macho car fanaticism that's so prevalent here but rather absent elsewhere in the world?\n It's a question I've been asked countless times, and one that is nearly impossible to answer. Is it the lasting bloodline of a nation of frontiersmen, born from armed struggle against an empire? Is it the legacy of personal determinacy, of a bootstrap nation that's obsessed with self-sufficiency?\n FBI background checks required to purchase firearms numbered 7 million from November to February, up 1.2 million from a year before. The surge may be in part be fueled by the collapse of the economy and fears of more prevalent crime, but many are tracing the increase to expectations of tighter regulation emerging from the White House.\n The anxiety, many on the left contend, is being unjustly fueled by the National Rifle Association.

That's a crucial first step. But it only has consequences if it's coupled with exceedingly thorough crackdowns on possession of unregistered firearms.\n In theory, criminals are the only ones who should have such unlicensed goods. Why not raise the marginal cost of gun crimes substantially? Why not make possession of an unregistered firearm, whether one brandishes it or not, a sentence punishable by life in prison?\n .......... \n \n Somehow, the Second Amendment, to my ear, rings of the needs of an agrarian society that knew it would likely find itself under empirical siege once more in the years to come: \"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n The framers, I imagine, weren't likely thinking of a nation armed with B-2 bombers and assault rifles that fire 50 rounds per second when they drafted the amendment.

The truth is out there, the facts are in, and it turns out we were right all along.\n \n \nWhat is this American fixation with firearms?\n\n \n What's our fixation with being able to have our own individual thoughts?

If there's a known terrorist with the alias of Bob Hugo, and there's 50,000 Bob Hugos in America, these jokers want all 50,000 of them to be stripped of their guns even if they committed no crimes.\n \n \nWhy not raise the marginal cost of gun crimes substantially? Why not make possession of an unregistered firearm, whether one brandishes it or not, a sentence punishable by life in prison?\n\n \n Because that would violate the 8th Amendment's provision outlawing excessive fines, and cruel and unusual punishment.\n \n \nSomehow, the Second Amendment, to my ear, rings of the needs of an agrarian society that knew it would likely find itself under empirical siege once more in the years to come:\n\n \n Ask the Japanese why they didn't launch a ground assault against America during World War 2.\n \n \nThe framers, I imagine, weren't likely thinking of a nation armed with B-2 bombers and assault rifles that fire 50 rounds per second when they drafted the amendment.

   "[QUOTE]New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Advises Gov. Paterson to Cut COBIS Program\n \n TROY, NY (10/19/2009)(readMedia)-- In these difficult economic times, Gov. Paterson has called for $3 billion in budget cuts. The New York State Rifle & Pistol Association has a suggestion for saving several million taxpayer dollars each year: abolish the Combined Ballistic Identification System (COBIS).\n \n The COBIS program was introduced by Gov. Pataki in 2000. Its stated purpose is to collect identifying data from the shell casings of all new handguns sold in the state. This information is then entered into a database for use by law enforcement to aid in identifying and prosecuting criminals. Since its inception, over a quarter of a million shell cases have been collected and entered into the database at an estimated cost of $32 million and not a single arrest or conviction has resulted. In fact, COBIS has proven to be such a boondoggle that no other state is even considering implementing their own version of it.\n \n If Gov. Paterson is serious about saving money, then COBIS ought to be at the top of the list of programs to be cut.[/QUOTE",

   "to carry out their unConstitutional mandates by his magnificent decrees of course with no understanding of our Republican Law.\n \n In yet another 5-4 decision, the Court in 1997 held unconstitutional a major part of the Brady Act, which sought to impose on local law enforcement officials the burden of conducting background checks for gun purchasers. The ruling in Printz v. United States held that Congress had no power to require state or local governments to enforce a federal regulatory law.\n \n Only powers delegated to the Federal Government Criminal Enforcement:\n The Constitution specifically authorizes federal enforcement of only three types of laws, all of which involve uniquely federal concerns. The first authorized federal criminal law enforcement is based on the Congressional power \"To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States.\" The counterfeiting enforcement power immediately follows the delegation of Congressional power \"To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin....\" U.S. Const., Art. I, sect. 8.\n The second Congressional criminal power involves the power \"To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations.\" The third is that \"Congress shall have Power to declare Punishment of Treason.\" Although currency, treason, and the high seas clearly involve areas of federal, and not state concern, it is notable that, even in those cases, the authors of the Constitution felt a need specifically to authorize Congressional law enforcement regarding these matters.\n \n In addition to the enumerated federal criminal powers, it is possible to infer some additional power. For example, Congress is given authority to declare uniform rules of bankruptcy; federal law does and should continue to punish bankruptcy fraud, even when perpetrated within a single state. Congressional power over federal property implies the authority to create penalties for destruction of federal property. \n \n While the body of the Constitution grants only narrow criminal law enforcement powers to the federal government, the Bill of Rights, in the Tenth Amendment, specifically reserves to the states all powers not granted to the federal government. - David Kopel",

I trust the odds -- \n\n I bet thats what they said about Virgina Tech to(sooner or later odds tend to catch up).\n as I do when boarding a plane -- more than a nerd&#8217;s marksmanship and tactics.\n I know the most likely situation in which I&#8217;ll be confronted with an armed rogue will be if he&#8217;s robbing a local store or place I&#8217;m staying -- a situation in which all involved are likely best off if he leaves with some cash and all weapons are kept from discharging.\n\n What happens if the armed\"rogue\"doesn't want to play like that?I wouldn't want to bet my life on it. \n \nWith 250 million guns owned in the U.S. today -- it&#8217;s as if we&#8217;re permanently awaiting a siege that will never come -- there&#8217;s simply no hope of eradicating arms from the American equation.\n\n Well if no siege comes, I guess no harm no foul.\n \nTo the chagrin of conservatives, Nancy Pelosi recently said that Obama doesn&#8217;t want people&#8217;s guns, only that their guns be registered. That&#8217;s a crucial first step. But it only has consequences if it&#8217;s coupled with exceedingly thorough crackdowns on possession of unregistered firearms.\n\n I'm not sure but I think I should say HEIL HITLER or something on those lines.\n \nIn theory, criminals are the only ones who should have such unlicensed goods. Why not raise the marginal cost of gun crimes substantially? Why not make possession of an unregistered firearm, whether one brandishes it or not, a sentence punishable by life in prison?\n\n Life in prison?why not execution?\n .......... \n Somehow, the Second Amendment, to my ear, rings of the needs of an agrarian society that knew it would likely find itself under empirical siege once more in the years to come: &#8220;A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.&#8221;\n \nThe framers, I imagine, weren&#8217;t likely thinking of a nation armed with B-2 bombers and assault rifles that fire 50 rounds per second when they drafted the amendment. But if they had the foresight to imagine such weapons, wouldn&#8217;t they have perhaps written the Second in a deft manner that would lead us to question its applicability? Perhaps putting the clause in reference to a broader context?[quote\n\n I suppose if they could imagine a B-2 and an assault rifle that had the rate of fire similar to a mini-gun.:pemoticon_hb",

I have watched quite a bit of childishness but this to me is the new low by which other examples of crass indifference to the suffering of others can now be measured. Four officers are murdered, and the only thought is what a wonderful opportunity this provides to demonstrate such a poor talent for sarcastic wit? Come on, Winston. This is not even a pretense at an intelligent discussion of this event. (\"That's not what it was meant to be\" you'll no doubt scream at your monitor. Rest assured-I know that was not your purpose) You may argue \"it's just humor.\" But it doesn't even qualify as \"gallows humor.\" That form of humor is at least an attempt to lighten the mood made by those who understand just how serious the situation is. \n \n Your posts are different entirely, Winston. They are nothing more than opportunistic expressions of spite poorly disguised as sarcastic humor. And it's done in such bad taste that no one here believes this was unintentional. Rather, it just exposes the single minded thought process of your posts-which are motivated solely by a desire to irritate people who do not share your views. \n \n What is the source of this anger which focuses all your creative energy and drives you so, Winston? What is it about your nature that makes you weigh every event, be it triumph or tragedy, in the opportunistic scale of how best could you use it to hurl sarcasm at people whom you have never met but you have nevertheless chosen to hate?  \n \n I know others act this way too, but I would be ashamed to be thought of as one of them. It is no excuse to claim others are rolling in it with you. I already know Brady acts the same way. Every post he makes is nothing more than a juvenile attempt to get a rise out of people he has learned to fear and hate-as his last post in this thread demonstrated. But even he has enough sense to at least make a pretense of respecting the innocent dead. And yet you really just don't care, do you? This whole blog experience here for you is nothing more than an exercise in trying to find easy targets for your simmering hatred, and then attempting to assuage that anger by saying whatever comes to mind to try and XXXX them off in the vain hope that making others miserable somehow eases the burden of dealing with your own misery. \n \n I'm not sure we have ever had a run in until now, and frankly I could care less. You want to have an honest discussion about this event or any other gun control topic-then ask and ye shall receive. But don't post things like this and expect anyone here to take you seriously. Pretend if you will that you possess an enlightened mind, but if these posts are to be considered evidence of this trait then know that I (and I suspect others here) have examined it and found it wanting. \n \n If, on the other hand, its attention you want, then you've got it. If you want respect, well you can have that too. I'll give you all the respect I feel you deserve.",

Poor boys who need a gun to face the world, prisoners of their fears, paranoia and cowardice.\n \n Grow up, real men don't need guns to face life or 1000 HP cars.\n\n \n No, by all means post in an open forum and pretend that you did not ask for the attention of all who might read it. You got it, whether you intended to or not. But if you were applying for the job of earning my respect then I have to tell you the interview is not going so well for you. \n \n If you didn&#8217;t like the fact that I took the moral high ground from you then you have only yourself to blame. You chose the field, and you chose where to plant your feet. If you really were interested in arguing &#8220;In Australia no one guns down 4 police officers&#8221; then you could have said that. There was no need to sarcastically trample over the fallen other than to satisfy your true intention of using a tragedy as an excuse to hurl barbs at those you hate. \n \n Listen now. I get it&#8212;I understand that you have convinced yourself you are the smartest man you have ever met, and I understand that you fear to test this opinion of yourself. I understand this is why you would rather create phantom stereotypes of gun &#8220;nuts&#8221; whom you want to believe cannot be reasoned with. You tell yourself that it is this&#8212;and not fear&#8212;which is the reason for your timidity. All this is perfectly fine. This is an open forum. You say what you will, and I will do the same. This is how we gauge the measure of each other. I can only say that I am truly disappointed you thought I would remain silent while you engaged in this exercise of frivolous self-conceit. I simply cannot ignore the temptation of calling out such a blatantly fraudulent explanation. \n \n Now you may of course tell yourself you don&#8217;t really care what others think of you, but we both know that your attempt to justify yourself after I called you out proves otherwise. How can you expect others to treat you with respect when you cannot be honest even with yourself?\n \n So go on, get your hate on and stay on the sidelines. Galileo, Sinjin, and others are unafraid to enter the arena. We argue and sometimes we just have to agree to disagree. But respect them for this&#8212;if there are &#8220;gun nuts here who are beyond reason&#8221; then at least they have the courage to try and demonstrate it. \n \n Finally Winston&#8212;I don&#8217;t hate you. I pity you&#8212;prisoner that you are of your fears, paranoia and cowardice. It restricts you to sarcastic sniping when I think you could offer so much more, which in turn leads me to choose between either ignoring you or making fun of you, and I guess today the latter is my choice. Just remember the beauty of this forum is you have the freedom to say far more than 2+2=4&#8212;and you don&#8217;t owe me anything in return. You don&#8217;t even have to reply to this post if you don&#8217;t want to. But if I can I would like to ask one favor. If you find Brady standing around with you on the sidelines would you please tell him I&#8217;m still looking for him and ask him to stop running away from me.\n \n ---\n \n &#8220;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. Shame on the man of cultivated taste who permits refinement to develop into fastidiousness that unfits him for doing the rough work of a workaday world. Among the free peoples who govern themselves there is but a small field of usefulness open for the men of cloistered life who shrink from contact with their fellows. Still less room is there for those who deride of slight what is done by those who actually bear the brunt of the day; nor yet for those others who always profess that they would like to take action, if only the conditions of life were not exactly what they actually are. The man who does nothing cuts the same sordid figure in the pages of history, whether he be a cynic, or fop, or voluptuary. There is little use for the being whose tepid soul knows nothing of great and generous emotion, of the high pride, the stern belief, the lofty enthusiasm, of the men who quell the storm and ride the thunder. Well for these men if they succeed; well also, though not so well, if they fail, given only that they have nobly ventured, and have put forth all their heart and strength. It is war-worn Hotspur, spent with hard fighting, he of the many errors and valiant end, over whose memory we love to linger, not over the memory of the young lord who \"but for the vile guns would have been a valiant soldier.\"&#8221; Theodore Roosevelt \"Citizenship in a Republic,\" Speech at the Sorbonne, Paris, France April 23, 1910.",
