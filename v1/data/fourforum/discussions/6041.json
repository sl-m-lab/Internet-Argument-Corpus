   "You cannot have a shooting policy other than \"shoot to kill.\" There is no such thing as a \"shoot to wound\" doctrine in law enforcement. The kind of scenes where the hero shoots from the hip and deliberately shoots the gun out of the bad guy's hand or intentionally \"wings\" him in the leg so he can be caught and arrested only happen in movies. I have never heard of a police force being taught anything other than \"if you must shoot, then shoot to kill.\" \n \n I would also be surprised if the \"shoot to kill policy\" that is being talked about here is new. You simply cannot change a firearms training doctrine overnight. LE officers go through several days if not weeks (depending on where you are) of firearm training, and I would bet that in London when new recruits went through their firearms training course they were taught from the beginning that if you must shoot then shoot to kill. And like every other police agency when the new recruits fired their weapons in training they would have been practicing to do just that. I seriously doubt that the rules and training procedures for officer involved shootings have changed much in three weeks.\n \n What you have in London is a tragic accident that deserves a thorough and fair inquiry. I have investigated officer involved shootings before, and I can tell you it is very rare that the number or placement of shots fired is an issue. The more critical question involves whether the officers legitimately felt they were justified in using their firearms. If the inquiry into the London shooting is to be a proper one, then my bet is it will focus on why the officers felt the need to fire their weapons at all and not on where their shots landed. This is a difficult question to answer, because it requires you to try and place yourself in their shoes, in the heat of the moment, relying on what they knew then and not what you know now, while factoring in what their training and experience would have been telling them when they decided to draw and fire. First and foremost, a thorough inquiry needs the cooperation of the officers involved. It needs them to be honest about what they heard, saw, and felt that led to their decision to shoot. I trust that they will be honest about it, because they should know that their explanation of what happened will be compared to the physical evidence the inquiry uncovers. \n \n ------\n \"We're going to have to take one step at a time, and the first step is necessarily, given political realities, going to be very modest.

   "That is an interesting point about the lack of familiarity of firearms in other nations.\n \n Many of us U.S. citizens literally grew up with guns in our hands, especially those of us outside of the congested inner city areas. I know I did and appreciate my right to own firearms to this day.\n \n Seeing a police officer NOT carrying a sidearm in the U.S. would be shocking. Eight-dollar-an-hour security guards often carry pistols in the U.S. Many states have concealed carry laws so a qualifying private citizen can carry a handgun inside his/her waistband or elsewhere.\n \n As shocking as it may be to some, I don't see how the hands of time can be turned back. Islamic terrorists have proven over and over again they can attack the free world anywhere at anytime. Police everywhere need to carry handguns. They are likely to be the first responders to terrorist threats. Will armed police save the day everytime? No, of course not, but unarmed police have no chance at all.\n \n The teaching of \"center mass\" shooting becomes an interesting debate when applied to a possible suicide bomber wearing a vest of explosives. From what I've read the London officer who shot the Brazilian placed his shots into the base of the back of his head, destroying the spinal cord connection rather than \"center mass\" where the possible explosives were.

   "I've never see or heard of a shoot to wound policy, and I believe it's so because it's just too hard to do anything other than shoot at the biggest target presented when under pressure. I've never shot at anything that was actively trying to kill me before, so I can't imagine the pressure that factor creates. I've done some training shooting with LE before, however, and I'd like to pretend that I'm a good shot. Yet I will confess that the hits aren't always exactly where I thought they were aimed, particularly if I and/or the target is in motion. The center mass theory was explained to me once as \"any bullet which strikes the target is far better than one which flies off into oblivion,\" and knowing that shooting under pressure is extremely difficult even for those trained to do it you must shoot for the largest target you have.\n \n If anything changed in London since July 7, it would likely be a change in who will now carry firearms regularly and/or a policy change over the rules of engagement for when a firearm may be used to end a perceived threat.\n \n In any event, all LE training I am familiar with treats any shooting incident as an application of deadly force, not wounding force. Most LE shootings involve a belief that the officer needed to apply deadly force in self defense, and the inevitable post-shooting inquiry is designed to test the legitimacy of that belief. I don't know enough of the facts from the London incident, but it appears that the justification here will be defense of others, and the inquiry will likely focus on whether the officers were justified in believing that the unfortunate victim was presenting an imminent threat of deadly force to others which justified the use of their firearms to end that perceived threat. \n \n No matter how the facts bear out, however, I think the ultimate responsibility lies at the feet of those who chose to create the tension which led to this shooting by waging their secretive and malicious brand of warfare against the heart of an otherwise civil society. Those responsible for the London attacks deserve to reap what they have sown. So long as it's done in a measured way against clearly identified and responsible enemies, then I will have no problem applauding any attempt by Mr. Blair to do his own remake of \"The Empire Strikes Back.\"",

Our insurance agent essentially cuts the premium up and each deaprtmetn pays its portion. I was shocked to see thatt he fire deaprtments porion was nearly 40% more than the sheriffs deaprtment in workmans comp and personal injury. I spent an entire day in a room with an analyst from the insurance company explaining that police officer is one of the safer jobs out there, and that their liability portion of the insurace is 80% higher than ours because most of them are XXXXXX. Can't argue with that. I grew up around cops and firefighters, WAY too many nerds whoa re looking for revenge for all the high school beatings they got on police departments, and way too many macho types who spend most of their time wshing trucks while regaling their bravery in the ranks of fire departments.\n \n \n \nIn regards to being assaulted, the 2003 rates show 12 assaults per 100 officers to be the national average, that is considerably higher than the national average for citizens, as it is 295 assaults per 100000 citizens. So I don't think you even know ahat you are talking about. A link to the UCR crime rates if you are interested in facts.\n \n http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm#cius\n \n\n \n Those are the same numbers I tried to use to make my case to the insurance twit. Then he pointed out the definition of the word \"assault\" used for the report:\n \n An unlawful threat or attempt to do bodily injury to another.\n Use of loud, offensive, or insulting language\n \n \n While that is certianly the legal definition of assault, I don't think it is the practical definition most people consider when they hear the word \"assault\", especially since it only covers an attempt to do bodily harm to somebody. If you are sucessful in your attempt, that becomes battery. Oddly enough, they have included battery in the assault numbers, but not seperated the times when people have been arrested and charged with assault for being rude to a cop (in several states, saying f you to a cop gets you arrested for assault).\n \n This does explain the wide diparity between the numbers when viewed from an insuracne standpoint. After all, who besides a cop would be enough of a XXXXX to press charges against somebody for speaking in a loud, insulting manner, or taking a swing that misses?\n \n So, we at the fire department pay our inflated personal injury and workmans comp insurance, and the sheriffs deaprtment picks up the lions share of the liability portion of the insurance. Realistically, neither job is especially dangerous, nto nearly as dangerous as being a construction worker, or auto mechanic, or factory worker, but pointing out such things does nto do much for the shildish ego needs of those who work in such positions.",

   "You obviously have a personal axe to grind with the lovely language about your local emergency services. You're the CFO? I wish I knew who you were, too bad your local fire service has such a low life person working for them with a lousy opinion of what they do they deserve better than you.\n \n \n\n \n \n Sorry, I prefer to base my assesments in reality as opposed to blind hero worship of LE officers and fire fighters. Seen too much of the reality to fall for the emotional rhetoric. I grew up with a father who was the fire chief of a mid sized midwestern town. While bravado and BS are fine for the grunts, it takes a keen business mind to keep such money pit enterprises funded, and a pretty good eye on public relations to keep the public believing that the services provided are worth the cost of those services.\n \n Axe to grind with my local emergency services? Not at all. My statements encompass pretty much the entire nation, they are not limited to our local situation at all, which is actually pretty good since we keep an eye on the bottom line, and we are still small enough that when one of our cops gets out of line, the sheriff can be counted on to act on the situation else risk having to get a real job. I don't have an axe to grind at all. \n \n \nAnyway this has strayed way too far off topic and way overdue to add you to the ignore list as you have nothing to say worth reading.\n\n \n Wow, little snippy, aren't we? Do you have a family member who is a cop or something? I realise your tastes run to logic free emotional rhetoric, excluding all relevant fact or history. You are more than welcome to that approach to things. Personally, I have always found you get a much better read on things if you can completlely isolate your thought processes from emotion and try to absorb a little reality before forming opinions or any issue.",
