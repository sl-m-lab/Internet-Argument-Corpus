I will say that the study did say this...\n \n http://www.smh.com.au/news/health/abortion-linked-to-mental-problems/2006/01/02/1136050394322.html\n \n Lucky for me I have a copy of the study...It is illegal for me to reproduce it in full but I can quote parts of it with proper citations. The person debating has the opition to debate without the study or can buy it from the website that sells it. If you work or attend a university you will should have access. The same rules apply to the judges regarding the study.",
