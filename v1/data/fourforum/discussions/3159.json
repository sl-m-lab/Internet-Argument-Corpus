He's being caught in lie after lie after lie, and he can switch positions more often than a pingpong ball in a lotto machine.\n \n What is disturbing to you about the fact that Americans want to know the truth?\n\n \n I'm not happy with Kerry for making Vietnam and Purple Hearts the centerpiece of his campaign. If you were going to tell me, \"I'm not going to vote for John Kerry just because he went to Vietnam,\" not only would I support you, I'd say you're absolutely right. Vietnam service is NOT enough reason to vote for (or against for that matter) any candidate, and Sen. Kerry's weakness in articulating a platform beyond that is seriously uncool. However, the intelligent part of us should be able to look beyond the Vietnam facade and find legitimate political reasons to vote for or against a candidate. You'll note that while I'm at least as anti-bush as you are anti-kerry, I have not said a word about Bush's guard service, possible cocaine use, harken energy, SEC investigation, or all of that other quasi-conspiracy **** that has nothing to do with politics. I think I've been pretty good at focusing myself on the issues. You're not doing that.\n \n Casting aside all the SBVT allegations for the moment (which have discussed ad naueseum), none of the allegations made by Winter Soldier (and lets be clear, Sen. Kerry was just reporting what Winter Soldier had alleged, he was not making these allegations himself in the senate testimony) have been disproven, in fact, most Vietnam scholars believe they are mostly accurate (though certain MEMBERS of Winter Soldier have been discredited, the theme of their story appears to be true)\n TNR 8/26/04\n \n Some of the organizers of the Winter Soldier Investigation have been discredited, but most of the testimonies themselves have not. Miami University Professor Jeffrey Kimball, one of the most respected Vietnam historians, says, \"On the whole, the Winter Soldier Investigations established that some Americans committed atrocities in Vietnam. Claims that their testimony has been discredited are unwarranted.\" Another prominent historian of the war, Wayne State University's Mel Small, says, \"Most of the evidence of atrocities presented by the [Winter Soldier] vets remains unchallenged to this day.\" \n \n On the question of atrocities more broadly, Kerry's claims also find widespread academic support. The University of Kentucky's George Herring, author of America's Longest War, says, \"The atrocities that took place are pretty much those described by Kerry in 1971.\" In a recent interview with The Boston Globe, Stanley Karnow, author of Vietnam: A History, also said Kerry got it right. Even Robert McNamara himself has stated that \"there were atrocities, without any question. ... I don't think enough attention was paid to it by the chain of command.\"\n\n \n Saying that Kerry met with Fonda is the same (if not slightly less incriminatory) as pointing out that Rummy met with Hussein. We can agree that wasn't a good thing to do, but ultimately Fonda and Hussein are responsible for their actions, not ever person who's ever been in contact with them (of course, Rumsfeld gave Hussein the material support and implicit green light to commit atrocities, while Kerry didn't do the same for Fonda. But again, different story).\n \n I find it interesting that you keep alleging Kerry is \"the most liberal senator.\" First you claimed it was based off his voting record. So I walked you through his voting record for the past year or so and we found that while Kerry is most certainly a \"liberal\" in the sense that all Democrats are, he was pretty reasonable and sensible on most of his votes. That failing, you shifted tacts and said its true because \"Washington Pundits\" say its true. Leaving aside the laughable credibility of most \"Washington Pundits,\" and the humor of deciding you're going to believe unsubstantiated rhetoric when it flies in the face of an empirical analysis I just placed right in front of you, I'M a Washington Pundit and I say he isn't the most liberal senator. So Washington Pundits are divided on the matter :) . But it still would be stupid to believe this washington pundit or any washington pundit if the rhetoric doesn't match the facts, and we reviewed the facts. Facts are stubborn things, and the fact is John Kerry is not unreasonably liberal.\n \n Next, again, casting aside Vietnam for a moment (can you do that? It appears to be a fetish for everyone (and yes that includes Kerry)). Where exactly has Kerry \"flipflopped?\" Give me the political issues. I've already dealt with the two big ones (Iraq and Yucca Mt., the latter wasn't really a flipflop considering what the votes said and the time lapse between them (and we've already agreed that if a reasonable amount of time passes people can change their mind in light of new evidence), and the former was not only not a flipflop, but probably the most intellectual tenable and coherent position out there right now). Throw some more at me. I'm sure he has flipflopped on occassion (as has Bush). But I have not seen any compelling evidence to show its a trend or that its a higher degree than any other politician (indeed, at the moment I know of more Bush flipflops than Kerry flipflops).\n \n Someone else asked for positive reasons to vote for Kerry (as opposed to just \"Bush Sucks.\") This is a fair request (though even if the dem. candidate was a politician to be determined later, I'd say \"freak chance is better than no chance.\" :)). Here are my positive reasons to vote for Kerry.\n 1) I like his education policy (Funding NCLB and giving raises to teachers whose students outperform on tests)\n 2) While I'm skeptical that Kerry will actually close the budget deficit entirely, clearly repealing the upper bracket tax cuts is the first step on the way to fiscal sanity. At the point where the CATO institute thinks that a democrat will act more fiscally responsible than a Republican, I'm willing to buy it. Bush appears to have no plan for the deficit, and his blaming of 9/11 and the war on terror for it is factually inaccurate (the CBO started projecting deficits in August of 2001).\n 3) Believe it or not, I feel I can trust Kerry more than Bush. At worst (and I don't believe this), Kerry lied about events 30 years ago. Bush lies about events that happend 2 WEEKS ago and appears to have no shame doing it. This goes back to my whole politics<personal schtick, which I thought should be a self-evident criteria for all voters but apparently is a novelity that places me in the extreme minority.\n 4) On THE most important issue for me, Homeland Security, Kerry has a FAR FAR FAR better plan than Bush does. Bush has been the single largest barrier to making our nation's internal defenses safer from September 2001 on, and that is inexcusable. Kerry, by contrast, appears to be serious about beefing up port security, securing our biological and nuclear facilities, and expanding Nunn/Lugar so that terrorists can't obtain loose nuclear material.\n 5) I supported the war in Iraq, and I think that Kerry will do a better job executing it than Bush did (though he's hampered by the mess he was left with). I agree with Kerry's (extremely consistent) Iraq policy 100%: The war was right, the execution wasn't, and this is too important an issue to f*** up.\n 6) I prefer Kerry's solid, hawkish, position on North Korea to Bush's schizophrenic and entirely inconsistent give a cookie take a cookie policy. God knows what Bush thinks about NK. Its impossible to tell from his policies.\n \n My positive reasons to be pro-kerry. There y'all have it!",

   "Repetition rules? Is that why you posted 7 links to the same document issue.\n \n More than one of them excludes the US and GB as sources because of the amateur appearance of the documents. More than one also says that GB had other evidence of the attempted purchased. More than one said that British Intelligence still stands behind their claim.\n \n ...\n\n \n Same document issue?? What the Funk&Wagnalls are you talking about?\n \n Anyway:\n http://psychoanalystsopposewar.org/resources_files/Ministers_knew_war_papers_were_forged,_says_diplomat.htm\n \n\n Mr Straw not only denied that the forged documents came from British sources, but said Britain's allegations about Iraq's quest for uranium in Africa came from \"quite separate sources\". He said he would give further details of these sources for the uranium allegation in a closed session on Friday, during which he was fiercely cross-questioned by Sir John Stanley, the committee's chief sceptic. After hearing what the Foreign Secretary had to say, the Tory MP is reported to have told Mr Straw he did not believe him.\n \n The testimony of the former US diplomat further undermines the claims of both the British and US governments that Saddam had developed, or was developing, weapons of mass destruction.\n \n The Niger connection became one of the most important and most controversial elements in the build-up to war, and both Britain and the US used it to claim that Iraq was \"reconstituting\" its nuclear programme. It later emerged that the report was based on forged letters obtained by Italian intelligence from an African diplomat. The Italians were said to have passed the letters to their British counterparts, from where they reached the CIA.\n \n When the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) finally had the opportunity to inspect the documents, nearly a year later, they were dismissed as fakes in less than a day. Neither the US nor Britain ever gave the IAEA any other information to back up their allegations on Iraq's uranium-buying activities, despite the \"separate sources\" cited by Mr Straw.\n\n \n http://globalresearch.ca/articles/CHO307C.html\n \nReleasing the 'Big Lie'\n \n When the unofficial 'release date' was reached in early June, the 'Big Lie' was revealed. Time magazine, which had relentlessly applauded the coalition's invasion plan, started accusing the Bush Administration of \"cooking the books\". How convenient! Now that Iraq is occupied, looted and pillaged by American and British troops, the lie has now belatedly surfaced on the front pages of America's newspapers.\n \n Leading Democrats in the US Congress were fully aware that the Administration's casus belli was a brazen lie. They had agreed, however, with their Republican cronies, to remain silent on the issue of cooked intelligence until after the Blitzkrieg and the conquest of Iraq. The US Senate and British House of Commons inquiries do not purport to \"undo a war\" waged on a fabricated pretext, nor demand the eventual withdrawal of coalition troops from Iraq. Quite the contrary - more troops have been sent into Iraq to quell armed resistance against occupation forces. (See p.3, Global Outlook, Issue 5.)\n \n As a result, the US has vastly increased its military presence in the broader Middle East Central Asian region. In the immediate wake of the war, even France, Germany and Russia, which had earlier opposed the invasion, granted (in the name of multilateralism) their unbending support to the US-UK led 'Authority' in Iraq. In so doing, they have not only violated the UN charter, they are also complicit in the crimes committed against the Iraqi people, including the killing of over 3,000 civilians and the maiming of countless others in the latest Gulf War.\n \n Visibly, a token deal had been struck, behind closed doors, between the victors and 'Old Europe' on sharing a portion of Iraq's sizeable oil wealth.\n \n The Project for a New American Century (PNAC)\n \n The 'public outcry' on cooked intelligence - carefully orchestrated by the corporate media - creates the illusion of an unbiased press and a functioning democracy. Yet this ritual, in which political leaders are said to be held accountable, also contributes to upholding the democratic fa\u00e7ade and its evolving police state apparatus. The war has been carried out. The political puppets have performed according to plan: how to let their heads roll, while the real powers behind the invasion - including the Anglo-American oil giants and weapons producers - divide up the spoils of war. (See p. 24.)\n \n Under the New World Order, discredited political leaders, who are the lackeys of powerful business interests are replaced by new political puppets. Republicans or Democrats - it makes no difference; this 'regular regime rotation' in a 'two party' system, plagued by corruption and conflict-of-interest, ensures continuity in America's Road-Map to Empire, while providing the illusion that Jeffersonian democracy continues to prevail.\n \n None of the current 'public outcries' for accountability will reverse the tide of US military expansion as outlined by the Project for a New American Century (PNAC). (See p.13.) The PNAC is a neo-conservative think tank linked to the Defense-Intelligence establishment, the Republican Party and the powerful Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) which plays a behind-the-scenes role in the formulation of US foreign policy.\n \n The PNAC's declared objective is quite simple - to \"Fight and decisively win in multiple, simultaneous theater wars\". In fact, barely after the so-called \"Liberation of Iraq\", the Bush Administration announced that Iran would be next in line. (See p.14.) More recently, the Administration has initiated, with the support of the UN, a similar WMD inspection drill, including the spreading of false information, directed at Iran.\n\n \n http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/CRG307A.html\n This is a whole list of articles.

It's quite a stance to attack Kerry for doing what your own candidate probably did himself.\n \n \n\n The Democrats are going to single handedly defeat themselves with lies.\n\n \n I don't buy predictions from known double standard holders. \n \n \n\n Actually, he's claiming that Bush is unfit to command because of his alledged AWOL incident, yet if he voted for Clinton, he thinks being a draft dodger is okay. That's a double standard. But, I forgot...Clinton and Kerry or Democrats...anything they do is okay.\n\n \n That's quite a big jump. So anyone who has done something that someone else says is wrong, yet if they vote for them automatically applies the same logic? yet all of this assumes he actually voted, which, according to his senate record, casts in a dubious light, therefore possibly derailing your entire argument. Let's assume Kerry DID vote for Clinton. That doesn't necessarily mean he thinks being a draft dodger is okay. The alternative may justify voting for what he does not necessarily like. Has every politican you voted had all the qualities and policies you like? Many people say that Bush is terrible and doesn't deserve another chance because of his role in Iraq, but they are still voting for him. Does that mean they are holding a double standard? No. Many are voting for him because he's the lesser of the two evils in their opinions. It doesn't mean they condone his actions, like you implied. Oversimplication is often a disease that runs rampant in both parties, something you clearly show.",

It wasn't around either. \n \n \n \n\n No, the issue is how this completely ignores the actual revelant parts of the election: the issues, which many of you here have shown little care for. When one disregards what candidates will enact in America and focus of silly events like these, it shows what they care about. \nThis is a non-sensical statement.
