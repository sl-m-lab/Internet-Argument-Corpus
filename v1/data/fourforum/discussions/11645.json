   "Brady, are you really that ignorant. Illegal drugs, unlike guns, have been proven only to destroy lives just by their use. Illegal drugs destroy brain cells, they destroy almost all family life when used, and they negatively affect the users judgement. This cant be said about guns, yes in some instances guns are used to destroy lives, but guns, unlike illegal drugs, are also credited with accomplishing good things in peoples lives. Guns are used in friendly and legal competitions, guns put food on peoples table through means of hunting, guns save lives through defensive uses. Guns also teach young people responsibility,maturity,laws, and the truth about gun ownership. Illegal drug use and possesion accomplishes none of these positives. So next time you post, try to use some common sense first.\n\n Wow, is there any good in this world that guns can't accomplish? Okay let's try some common sense.... Most of the benefits of gun ownership that you mention could probably be attained in other and better ways. For example, cars do more to put food on the table than guns because people need cars to drive to the grocery store. Teaching someone to fill out a job application and balance a checkbook does much more to teach someone responsiblity and maturity in today's world than gun ownership.",

Most of the benefits of gun ownership that you mention could probably be attained in other and better ways.\n\n \n I thought you said you wanted to try common sense, and then you go ahead and make a stupid statement like that?\n \n \nFor example, cars do more to put food on the table than guns because people need cars to drive to the grocery store.\n\n \n Hunting is cheaper than going to the grocery store if your goal is bulk meats. Take a couple of deer for about $1 each in terms of bullet cost, you've got several hundred pounds of meat that can feed your family for months. Not having to drive that home over who knows how many miles will save a bundle in gas money.\n \n \nTeaching someone to fill out a job application and balance a checkbook does much more to teach someone responsiblity and maturity in today's world than gun ownership.\n\n \n No it won't, the government is currently sending the message \"Go ahead, spend money you don't have, if you get in trouble we'll cover your debt, you don't have to worry because we'll look out for you\". That's not responsibility!\n \n You claimed that the benefits of gun ownership could be achieved by other means. How about personal defense and being able to stop a criminal in their tracks so the police can get them? Are you gonna try and claim that dialing 911 will have the same intimidatory effect as having a gun in your face and stop a criminal dead in their tracks until the police get there? If somebody's stabbing a woman in the parking lot of a grocery store in broad daylight, is yelling \"I'm calling the police!\" seriously going to make him cease and desist his actions?",
