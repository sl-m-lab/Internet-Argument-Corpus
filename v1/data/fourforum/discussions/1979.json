   "Actually, there is a fairly interesting paper at http://www.catb.org/~esr/guns/gun-control.html that I think is fairly telling. IT is 56 pages long, so make sure you have some time beofre digging in. \n \n In a nutshell, the guy examines some common myths from both sides of the gun control argument. One of them is that gun owners are more afraid than non-gun owners. HE cites a few different sources which show that in reality, gun owners tend to be less afraid of crime and criminals and more confident in their ability to take care of themselves, even in the absence of a firearm. THere was also an interesting study done a while back at the university of colorado that showed that gun owners showed more self confidence than non gun owners in 97% of those surveyed.\n \n This explains, to me at least, why the liberals and the gun grabbers want to ban gus in the name of \"Safety\". They are not confident in their ability to handle such an instrument, therefore they don't feel that others are able to handle them either. \n \n I think this also speaks volumes in regards to why responsible gun owners have difficulty understanding the rhetoric of gun banners. We hear about accidental shootings, kids getting ahold of their parents guns, or peoples guns being used aginst them in a robbery.\n \n Now, I am a responsible gun owner, and I am assumeng that you are, also. Neither you nor I is going to leave a loded .45 where a little kid can get it. We know that we are intelligent enough that we are NOT going to forget about the uzi we left on the coffee table. I would NEVER shoot at somebody in my home unless I had identified that they were not friendly, and there is not one chance in the burning pits of hell that somebody is going to get my gun away from me and use it against me. \n \n The first scenario (failure to stroe a gun correctly/teah your kids to respect them) is indicitive of somebody with low self confidence, they are afraid they lack the ability. THe second scenario (accidentaly shooting/misidentifyign target) I think speaks more of one of hte core differences between liberals and conservatives, namely that conservatives tend to be more analytical while liberals are more prone to knee jerk emotional reactions \n \n I saw a guy the other day who was explaining why more liberal types tend to become lawyers and media personalities. Conservatives want to do your taxes and run your company. Liberals want to feel your pain.\n \n I can understand how somebody who is motivated by emotional responses, and more fearful (due to lack of conficdence) in general could potentially shoot somebody in the dark out of fear only to turn on the light and find that they had just murdered their spouse. This may indeed be a realistic fear. Perhapse liberals should not be allowed to own guns.\n \n As far as te third (an attacker using your gun against you), this is obviously related to the self confidence issue. These are people that doubt their ability even when armed to provide for their own safety.",

(there is much to read here about these 2 subjects, perhaps you might want to go read a little of those posts...they are very interesting.) I think laws stating that you should not be allowed to carry guns onto airplanes or into schools are examples of common sense gun control laws meant to protect people. Of course we all know that only when properly enforced will these laws actually keep the guns out...as criminals do not obey laws, so proper enforcement is required. Not all gun control laws make sense. Many are frivolous laws designed to harrass the general gun owning population simply because someone else is not comfortable around guns.",

With a gun you can threat and potentially harm your victim from a distance and everyone could do so. With a knife you have to get into close contact and then you also have to hit your victim quite hard and it is a dirty thing.\n Criminals use the easiest option.",

I agree that the majority of gun control laws are ****. Some make sense.

My main argument is that the common sense laws that we have in place need to be enforced.  Without enforcement, any law is pointless. There are some on this forum that state that any law restricting the right to own or use a gun is unconstitutional, and I feel that this is a dangerous theory. The courts over the last 30 years have never been able to agree on a firm and binding interpretation of the constitution on the 2nd amendment, it has been taken on a case by case basis it seems.

   "I don't think we are likely to see a determination by the supreme court on this issue in our life time. The reason for this is simple: I don;t think either side really wants to see it. ON the one side, you have the liberals whose best defense to the second amendment seems to be the collective rights theory. While this is an interesting theory, it is unlikely to hold up to supreme court scrutiny which traditionally has relied heavily on original intent in deciding constitutional issues. There have even been rulings by the supreme court that original intent is the only valid criteria when deciding constitutional cases. Given the vast amount of literature we have from the original framers of the constitution that clearly lay out their intent in the second amendment, the collective rights argument is not likely to prevail.\n \n Then you have a situation where it is confirmed that the Second Amendment does in fact convey an individual right, which SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED. This leads to a rather sticky situation. Background checks would, of course, be illegal since you cannot attach a prerequesit to the practice of a right. You also end up with some rather delicate issues insofar as exactly what types of limits you COULD impose before infringement begins. Concealed acrry laws would most certainly be an infringement, as would the NFA, which requires a $200 conditional tax stamp in order to own a machine gun. \n \n This also brings another interesting question. At exactly what point does your individual right to bear arms end? Since the original intent of the founding fathers was without question to ensure that people be armed with the latest military style weapons, the posession of rocket launchers, hand grenades, gatling guns and anti tank rockets would obviously be covered by this individual right. OF coursem nuclear weapons (despite the rediculous ascertations of liberal who use it for shock value) would NOT be covered by your individual right, since it would not realistically be connected to the maintenance of a well regulated militia (you do not use nukes in domestic wars), which is one condition already laid down by the supreme court in the Miller case to the practice of your right to bear arms.\n \n Realistically, it is unlkely that the posession of rocket launchers heavy wepaons would be a problem as far as crime is concerned since these items are already available on the black market, as well as being incredibly easy to construct (a gun generally has upwards of a dozen functional parts, at least 4 of which are precision machined, a bazooka only has 5 moving parts, none of which require precision machining). Heavy weapons are simply a poor choice for commiting a crime. \n \n So, why do the conservatives in government not want the second amendment to hit the supreme court? WE live in a country where there is an ever widening gap between the rich and the poor. The economy is either good for the rich (including corporate interests), or good for the poor. Seldom is the economy good for all Americans at the same time. WE also live in a society where freedoms are slowly being eroded and liberties which we have always taken for granted are starting to disapear (such as burden of proof shifting in some cases from prosecutor to defendant ). IF you were a memeber of he US government, would YOU want your citizens to be armed in such circumstances?\n \n I would agree that common sense gun control laws are a good idea. I disagree as to what can be considered \"common sense gun control\". IMO, in order to constitute \"common sense gun control\", a law needs to meet the following criteria:\n \n 1. It should address a recognised problem\n 2. It should be enforcable\n 3. It should not infringe on constitutional rights\n 3. The costs associated with administration/enforcement should not outweigh the benifits \n \n To the best of my knowledge, we have not in the history of this country had any problems associated with guns being legally used either in schools or on airplanes. An airplane is private property, thus the decision to allow or deny the carrying of weapons should lie with the owner of the airplane, not with the federal government. WHen guns were commonly carried on airplanes, there was never an incident of hijacking. The first hijacking was commited more than 10 years after guns were banned on aircraft. Realistically speaking, most airlines would be likely to continue banning weapons ont heir planes, so this is really a non issue.\n \n IT is also not within my knowledge that a shooting has ever taken place at a school where the individual involved was legally able to posess a gun. The law requires that you be over 18 in order to posess a rifle or shotgun, over 21 to posess a handgun. You further can not be a felon, can not be under a restraining order, can not have been convicted in a domestic violence case, and can not be mentaly defective. I don't think that any school shooting has ever occured where the individual has met all of those criteria. It seems foolish to me to ban posession of wepaons to people who meet all of those criteria, even if it is at a school. When that occasional deranged individual does come along who wants to shoot up a school, you have effectively removed one of the few tools that would be useful to stopping them. \n \n As far as background checks go, we have had them for quite a while, and they do not seem to do a bit of good. There has been no decrease in violent crime that can be linked to background checks. They cost millions of dollars per year to administer, yet provide no real benifit. THe number of people that are turned down for gun purchase and are actually prevented from eventually purchasing a gun through a dealer are pretty low. Prosecutions for those who actually DO apply and attempt to purchase a weapon even though they are prohibited are incredibly rare. There is actaully a reason for this. In order for such a prosecution to be effective, the prosecutor would have to prove that the person attempted to purchase a weapon KNOWING that they were prohibited by law from doing so. \n \n Do you see the problem here? A prosecutor would be stuck having to convince a jury that this individual walked into a gun store and filled out an application, with full knowledge that a background check would be performed, KNOWING that they were ineligeble to purchase a weapon. IT absolutly flies in the face of logic that anybody is going to walk into a gun store and incriminate themselves by filling out forms that they KNOW are going to be sent to the federal government wehn they are inelegible to purchase a firearm. IF you were a prosecutor, would you really want to take this in front of a jury? THere are also constitutional issues here. The supreme court has already ruled that you CANNOT charge a convicted felon with failing to register a weapon, as registering the wepon would be an act of self incrimination. IT would seem logical that basing prosecution on a form that an ineligeble person is required to fill out would fall under the same guidelines.\n \n I would agree that stricter penaltie for gun related crimes is a common sense gun control measure. Here in kansas, a burglar caught armed is automatically subject to a 5 year extension on their prison sentence. For years, we enjoyed a much lower rate of armed burglary than other states that do not have such laws. Recently, our rate of armed buglary is up (though stll much lower than many other states). I believe this is due to a change in recent judicial practice. While it used to be that the 5 year sentence for posession of the weapon generally ran consecutive to the sentece for breaking and entering (which was generally 5 years, for a total of 10 years), it has recently become common judicial practice to set the sentence to run concurrent to the sentence for breaking and entering, so the person only serves 5 years in total. \n \n A similar situation exists in regards to our law that requires a stricter sentence for drug related crimes that involve the use or posession of a firearm. Prosecutors routinely plea bargain these cases down, and judges routinely reduce sentences in response to overfilled jails and overloaded court dockets. \n \n While these types of programs are unquestionably effective in curbing criminal gun usage, the big question is are we willing to pay the price? Keeping people in jail for years is not a cheap proposition. I know that our local county jail rents beds to johnson county (the most populated county in KS, and the one with the highest crime rates). 95% of the prisoners are from johnson county. The next county over has a 315 bed jail which is full all the time, and 99% of their prisoners are farm outs from other counties (that county only has 3100 people in the whole county, and very low crime rates). They are getting ready to d an expansion and add ANOTHER 300 beds, and their research shows that they can expect them to be full all the time. One of the jails charges $35 per day per prisoner, the other charges $45 per day per prisoner. WE will average the two ad say it costs $0 per day, per prisoner to keep somebody in jail in kansas. This means that to tack 5 years onto a single persons sentence costs 73,000 dollars. \n \n That money has to come from somewhere. Currently, KAnsas is (I think along with several other states) in a major budget crunch. They have resorted to collecting property taxes early and giving out income tax returns late to make up for this. Where are we going to come up with an extra $73,000 per prisoner over a 5 year period to pay for enforcement of these gun control laws?\n \n I am not saying thes types of laws are a bad idea, I think they are an excellent idea and I think they are much more likely to be effective than a lot of the other gun control laws that are currently in effect or have been proposed, but I think that we need to seriously look at such questions as how much it is going to cost and how to fund such things.",

   "To which proposed law are you reffering to? I agree that the majority of gun control laws are ****. Some make sense. I only support common sense gun control measures, thing such as no guns in schools, no guns on airplanes, background checks for the sale of all firearms, tougher sentences for crimes in which guns are used, etc. I don't know which proposed gun control measure you are speaking of. My main argument is that the common sense laws that we have in place need to be enforced.  Without enforcement, any law is pointless. There are some on this forum that state that any law restricting the right to own or use a gun is unconstitutional, and I feel that this is a dangerous theory. The courts over the last 30 years have never been able to agree on a firm and binding interpretation of the constitution on the 2nd amendment, it has been taken on a case by case basis it seems. I think if we really want to make progress on the issue, we first need to interpret the constitution to apply to modern America.\n\n \n \n If this is your belief on the gun control issue,then we are on the same page.\n All the things you mentioned such as ,no guns in schools,airplanes,background checks are all enforced as we speak.\n I also agree with you on the enforcement issue.A majority of gun owners are pressing this very issue.We ask the question.\"Why make new laws when the old ones are not enforced?",

   "Why would gun control measures like keeping a register of all the guns sold and who to permantly, or vetting people who buy guns beforehand be a threat to a law abiding citizen, all it will do is make investigations of crimes easier and make it that much harder to get guns for a criminal. I think that something similar to a driving test for firearms seems reasonable, make sure that people know how to safely store and use guns as well as making them feel safer using them.\n \n I am curious how this makes me a communist though;)\n\n \n \n For starters, contrary to what some news sources say, for every gun sold by a dealer, the dealer keeps a record of the gun's make, model, caliber, and serial number, as well as who the gun was sold to, their driver's license number, address, height, weight, race, etc. These records are kept by the dealer, and any information on the form must be provided to the BATFE anytime it is requested. These are not the records gun rights activists demand are destroyed within 24 hours. Secondly, I would love the opportunity to ensure that everone who purchases or comes into contact with a weapon knows how to properly and safely handle it. However, I would not trust the government to come up with the requirements for such regulation. I look at the TSA and the armed-pilots program, it is my understanding that the government is making this process very difficult for those that want to enroll. Many have said that the process is intrusive and insulting. It's not so hard for me to believe that if a process like this was necessary to purchase a firearm, then it would amount to the government intimidating people not to exercise their second amendment. I would love it if firearm safety were taught in schools, and at a relatively young age. It amazes me that those who advocate \"gun safety\" in lieu of gun control spend so little time promoting education, and so much time promoting storage methods that a) make the gun unavailable in an emergency, and b) likely just make the gun seem more mysterious and appealing to the same children we are keeping them away from. I think that the \"do not touch\" approach does have it's merits, but that should not be the only avenue taken. To me it's just like sex ed. Teaching abstinence is great, but when you only do that, people who don't choose abstinence should know that there are safe and unsafe ways to do things.",

The supreme court has said, and rightly so, that there can be no prequalification for the exercise of a right. A right is something you exercise without ant kind of permission. Permit is actually a word derived from the word permission. RIGHT and PERMIT are absolutly mutually exclusive. This is what the GG's don't seem to understand when they say \"you can still have your guns, you just need a permit\". There is NO SUCH THING as a RIGHT that requires a PERMIT. One of the direct causes of the American Revolution was that british were trying to confiscate guns from those who did not heve PERMITS signed by the governer.

It is the power of the vote that ensures us there will be an America tommorow, it is the second amendment that ensures it will be free.\n \n Our forefathers knew that political systems could be corrupted, they knew about special interests, and political parties, and foreign intervention in election.

The Second Amendment has nothing to do with self defense, though it is intended to gaurantee a free democracy. The idea is not, nor was it ever, for a single citizen to be able to take on the government. The idea was for the citizenry as a collective to be able to resist a tyrannical government. Don't think you can do so with small arms such as RPG's and machine guns? Tune in to MSNBC tonight and wait for a story about Iraq, and you will see a bunch of guys with small arms resistng the most powerful military the world has ever known. \n \n The two puroses of the Second Amendment were to protect against foreign invasion and as a check against a tyrannical government. This is EXACTLY why we should be allowed to have an RPG, a rocket launcher, a bazooka, a .50 anti aircraft gun, a stinger missile or a hellfire missile if we so desire. The idea was for every American to be armed with \"weapons which are of common military use\". While it is definatly possible to resist government forces using only rifles, pistols and shotguns, it would be much easier with heavier weapons. These are weapons used in self defens, but not hte kind you are thinking. Thee weapons are the kind of thing that would be used to protect yourself against a tyrannical government, or a foreign invader. The right to prtect you self from other individuals is not really gauranteed by the second ammendment at all. IT is not expressly mentioned ANYWHERE in the bill of rights.

YOu do not really need a penis for urination. Sometimes, using that penis to have sex is illegal. THe purpose of an RPG is to kill. In some cases, they killing would be illegal. IT is the same thing. \n \n THe analogy of the lion is a poor one. First of all, a lion is a dumb animal driven soley by instinct. People are not. Second, a lion will instinctively kill, people do not kill by instinct. I doubt we would just kill the lion, most likely efforts would first be made to relocate it, as we know that lions are generally fearful of people and will not attack a person. Thre are actually mountain lions seen in the suburbs of Denver and Boulder. It is illegal to kill them unless they are attacking a person or livestock. Interestingly enough, in kansas (where I live) it is illegal to shoot a dog unless it is atacking a person or alivestock. Don't people deserve the same consideration given to a dog?",
