   "I have read several threads and many, many posts devoted to indicting whites. Well when people are always pointing fingers at you, one is justified in pointing back. So what I intend to do in this post is to document the failings of blacks as a group. The list is a very long one, but let me start with what disturbs people most: crime.\n \n According to the National Crime Victimization Survey the following percent of face-to-face crimes were committed by black offenders even though blacks are only 12.3% of the country (the latest year available--all these date are available at www.albany.edu/sourcebook):\n \n Lone Offenders \n rape 22.5%\n robbery with injury 38.6%\n robbery without injury 54.8%\n aggravated assault 26.8%\n simple assault 21.5%\n \n Multiple Offenders \n rape 40.3%\n robbery with injury 66.2%\n robbery without injury 67.4%\n aggravated assault 31.9%\n simple assault 24.1%\n \n Look how these numbers parallel the arrest statistics, showing that blacks are getting arrested in the numbers testified to by witnesses (from the survey--this is evidence of very little bias)\n rape 34.8%\n total robbery 53.8%\n aggravated assault 33.7%\n simple assault 32.2%\n murder 48.7%\n burglary 28.5%\n larceny 31.2%\n autotheft 39.8%\n arson 20.7%\n forgery/counterfeiting 30.1%\n fraud 31%\n embezzlement 32%\n selling/buying stolen property 38.7%\n vandalism 23%\n weapons 37.2%\n prostitution 40.3%\n sex offenses 24.2% \n drug abuse violations 34.5%\n gambling 68.1%\n offenses against family and children 29.5%\n DUI 10.2%\n liquor laws 10%\n drunkeness 13.3%\n disorderly conduct 33.4%\n vagrancy 35.7%\n suspicion 36.9%\n curfew and loitering 27.1%\n runaways 19.1%\n \n Notice that except for alcohol-related offenses, blacks rates are somewhere between 2 and 5 times what they should be based on their population size. Also notice that blacks are even overrepresented in white-collar crimes which have been stereotyped as white crimes. Most cases of embezzlement, for example, are skimming cash from the till, not the high profile cases you hear about in the news. Finally, notice that the percentages are highest for the most serious, violent crimes, and the number are much lower for minor crimes. If there were rampant discrimination in the system, you would expect the numbers to be highest in the minor crimes where cops have the most wiggle room in the decision whether to arrest. \n \n The criminal justice system (cjs) costs taxpayers upwards of 200 billion dollars a year, not counting private security costs. To put the price in context, to rebuild one of the twin towers would cost 2 billion--that's like 1 percent of the cjs costs. Blacks are only 12 percent of the population but almost half of the cost of cjs is processing black criminals. There are roughly 3 million crimes committed by blacks each year (and that's only counting the ones that get reported to police), so it's very difficult to get your mind around the total social costs inflicted on a society by that many crimes from a comparatively small group of people. \n \n One other quick point for now is that there are possibly 1 million gang members now across the country (easily 100,000 here in CA alone) and almost half of them are African American. (By the way, the other half is almost all Hispanic).",

So what I intend to do in this post is to document the failings of blacks as a group. The list is a very long one, but let me start with what disturbs people most: crime.\n \n According to the National Crime Victimization Survey the following percent of face-to-face crimes were committed by black offenders even though blacks are only 12.3% of the country (the latest year available--all these date are available at www.albany.edu/sourcebook):\n \n Lone Offenders \n rape 22.5%\n robbery with injury 38.6%\n robbery without injury 54.8%\n aggravated assault 26.8%\n simple assault 21.5%\n \n Multiple Offenders \n rape 40.3%\n robbery with injury 66.2%\n robbery without injury 67.4%\n aggravated assault 31.9%\n simple assault 24.1%\n \n Look how these numbers parallel the arrest statistics, showing that blacks are getting arrested in the numbers testified to by witnesses (from the survey--this is evidence of very little bias)\n rape 34.8%\n total robbery 53.8%\n aggravated assault 33.7%\n simple assault 32.2%\n murder 48.7%\n burglary 28.5%\n larceny 31.2%\n autotheft 39.8%\n arson 20.7%\n forgery/counterfeiting 30.1%\n fraud 31%\n embezzlement 32%\n selling/buying stolen property 38.7%\n vandalism 23%\n weapons 37.2%\n prostitution 40.3%\n sex offenses 24.2% \n drug abuse violations 34.5%\n gambling 68.1%\n offenses against family and children 29.5%\n DUI 10.2%\n liquor laws 10%\n drunkeness 13.3%\n disorderly conduct 33.4%\n vagrancy 35.7%\n suspicion 36.9%\n curfew and loitering 27.1%\n runaways 19.1%\n \n Notice that except for alcohol-related offenses, blacks rates are somewhere between 2 and 5 times what they should be based on their population size. Also notice that blacks are even overrepresented in white-collar crimes which have been stereotyped as white crimes. Most cases of embezzlement, for example, are skimming cash from the till, not the high profile cases you hear about in the news. Finally, notice that the percentages are highest for the most serious, violent crimes, and the number are much lower for minor crimes. If there were rampant discrimination in the system, you would expect the numbers to be highest in the minor crimes where cops have the most wiggle room in the decision whether to arrest. \n \n The criminal justice system (cjs) costs taxpayers upwards of 200 billion dollars a year, not counting private security costs. To put the price in context, to rebuild one of the twin towers would cost 2 billion--that's like 1 percent of the cjs costs. Blacks are only 12 percent of the population but almost half of the cost of cjs is processing black criminals. There are roughly 3 million crimes committed by blacks each year (and that's only counting the ones that get reported to police), so it's very difficult to get your mind around the total social costs inflicted on a society by that many crimes from a comparatively small group of people. \n \n One other quick point for now is that there are possibly 1 million gang members now across the country (easily 100,000 here in CA alone) and almost half of them are African American. (By the way, the other half is almost all Hispanic).\n\n \n Just to llet you know how manipulated those statistics are I'll explain what we learned in criminal sentencing.\n \n Minorities under the same circumstances and record receive more sever penaltis than whites. The variable that determines the sentence is more dependent on the victim than the perpetrator. Blacks victimize blacks receive lesser sentences than Blacks that victimize whites. Also Whites that vitimize Blacks receive lesser sentences than whites that victimize whites.\n \n Also there is documnetation of how juveniles that are arrested are more likely to be dealt with by their parents and not prosecuted if they're white. If they're black then they are more likely to be prosecuted.\n \n Mr. Boyd summarized three general themes of the Task Force report submitted to the Supreme Court in February 1993. These are: 1) women and minorities are not well represented in the justice system; 2) women and minorities have less confidence in the justice system than white men; and 3) gender and race may at times negatively impact certain classes of litigants. Regarding racial issues, the criminal case study, coordinated by Dr. Keith Crew of the University of Northern Iowa, analyzed charging, pretrial release, and sentencing data from Polk, Scott, Woodbury, and Blackhawk counties over a two-year period. The study concluded that minority defendants are likely to be charged more severely, receive higher bond amounts, released less often on pretrial release, and sentenced to prison more often than white defendants. Though the effect of race on these decisions was not large compared to other factors, the study found it be statistically significant. \n \n http://www.legis.state.ia.us/GA/78GA/Interim/1999/comminfo/sent/mn990913.htm\n \n \n * A 1990 report released by the federal government's General Accounting\n Office found a \"pattern of evidence indicating racial disparities in the\n charging, sentencing and imposition of the death penalty after the Furman\n decision.\"\n \n * Professor David Baldus examined sentencing patterns in Georgia in the\n 1970's. After reviewing over 2,500 homicide cases in that state,\n controlling for 230 non-racial factors, he concluded that a person accused\n of killing a white was 4.3 times more likely to be sentenced to death than\n a person accused of killing a black.\n \n * The Stanford Law Review published a study that found similar patterns of\n racial disparity, based on the race of the victim, in Arkansas, Florida,\n Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Virginia (see\n enclosed bibliography). For example, in Arkansas findings showed that\n defendants in a case involving a white victim are three-and-a-half times\n more likely to be sentenced to death; in Illinois, four times; in North\n Carolina, 4.4 times, and in Mississippi five times more likely to be\n sentenced to death than defendants convicted of murdering blacks.\n \n * The Florida Law Review published a study that examined all homicides\n committed and death sentences rendered in Florida between 1976 and 1987.\n The study found that, in that state, the odds of receiving a death\n sentence are 3.4 times higher for defendants convicted of killing whites\n than for those convicted of killing blacks.\n \n \n Additional facts linking race with the death penalty:\n \n * Since the resumption of executions in the early 1980's, 40 percent of\n those executed have been black.\n \n * In the Oomulgee Judicial Circuit, which encompasses eight counties in\n Georgia, the district attorney sought the death penalty in 28 cases\n between 1974 and 1991. The defendant was black in 22 of the cases.\n \n * In several jurisdictions, and for specific types of cases, black\n defendants are more likely than white defendants to be sentenced to death\n for comparable crimes.\n \n * Of the 232 executions carried out in the U.S. since 1977, only one white\n person has been put to death for the murder of a black person.\n \n http://sun.soci.niu.edu/~critcrim/dp/dppapers/dpfact.txt\n \n A 1998 Alabama report found that African-Americans were more likely to be incarcerated and sentenced longer than White offenders. The Birmingham Post-Herald's analysis of drug convictions from 1990 through 1997 found that \"African-Americans convicted of drug crimes in Alabama are twice as likely to receive jail time as Whites, and nearly 2.5 times as likely to receive prison terms of one year or more\" (1998). They also found that 64% of African-Americans received prison terms compared to 48% of Whites for cocaine possession charges. This analysis suggests that reasons for the disparity are \"low numbers of Black judges and prosecutors in state courts, the inability of Blacks to afford top lawyers, and sentencing enhancements, which add years to the sentences of convicted drug dealers\" (1998).\n \n http://www.msccsp.org/publications/issues_disparity.html\n \n Act of 1984 and concludes the following. First, after controlling for extensive criminological,demographic, and socioeconomic variables, I found that blacks, males, and offenderswith low levels of education and income receive substantially longer sentences.Second, disparities are primarily generated by departures from the guidelines, rather than differential sentencing within the guidelines. Departures produce about 55 percent of the black-white difference and 70 percent of the male-female difference. Third, although\n black-white disparities occur across offenses, the largest differences are for drug traf-ficking. The Hispanic-white disparity is generated primarily by those convicted of drug trafficking and firearm possession/trafficking. Last, blacks and males are also less likely to get no prison term when that option is available; less likely to receive downward departures; and more likely to receive upward adjustments and, conditioned on having a downward departure, receive smaller reductions than whites and females.\n \n http://www.terry.uga.edu/~dmustard/sentencing.pdf\n \n \n Overall Galton this shows your lack of understanding of the subject. I have pointed out how you show a lack of understanding of information. Your use of statistics and references to bias material IMHO shows that you have no intention of learning the truth. That you have an agenda of proving whites are superior. This is evident in many of your posts.

   "I'm just as safe in the Houston Ghettos as I would be in the Woodlands?\n\n You've hit the nail on the head there. No, you would probably be decidedly unsafe in any area where there are a large number of people of color. Especially if you opened your mouth. If one of the kids from the Houston Ghetto were to mozy on over to your neighborhood, he'd be in a cop car before his foot crossed the fancy stone entranceway. Safe is a relative feeling, is my point. \n \n Most of the people who live in ghettos are families, with small children. There's no reason for such people to bug anybody who doesn't disturb them. There are violent people everywhere. No area is \"safe\".\n \n \nMizmaxx, why the loss of faith in facts all the sudden? \n\n For one, first you accuse me of not having \"common sense\" and basing my views on numbers \"instead of reality\", and now that I've shared my personal experience you want numbers. How very contradictory.\n \n Also, it seems obvious to me that your point is baseless. Knowledgeable as you claim to be in criminology, you must know that so-called \"white-collar\" crime does much more damage to society in lives and in dollars than petty crime. It may be more politically convenient to fill the papers and news with \"young black male\" perpetrators, but people are much more likely to be killed by cigarettes, unsafe vehicles, and workplace accidents etc than by the young black man on the street. So, even if your numbers were true (which I doubt), it would prove nothing.\n \n Besides which, your \"source\" was a website with numerous links to numerous studies. Since you didn't specify which ones you used, I've looked at several seemingly relevant ones to try to discern the same thing that Haulingboat and Whistler pointed out. Again, no one source or study is empirical, so I prefer to see more than one study. \n \n \nBlacks by far face the highest risks of being victims of street crime.\n\n That's because the only people given the social, political and physical power to protect them- the cops- do the opposite.",

I would have to look them up in my notes to ref.\n \n \nWhite collar crime can be devastating, but you can have all my money WAY before you can have my life - or my wife.\n\n White-collar crime costs not only more money, but also more lives yearly than petty crime, as I said. When a businessman decides to ignore safety regulations and a person is maimed or killed, how is that different than someone walking up to you and stabbing you? You're just as dead.\n \n The fact is that many people do what they can within their power to make money, even if it means breaking the law, and equally across racial and economic groups. It is simply that white people have more money in general, and therefore their crimes are more likely to be in the realm of business, etc. Why walk up to someone and mug them (risking personal injury and arrest) when you can rob hundreds through low wages? Why shoot people in a bank robbery when you are making tons of cash ignoring safety rules or environmental laws? The effect is not only equivalent, but in fact more dire. The degree to which one has power is equal to the degree to which they can do harm. Since money is power in our world, rich people can do much more harm than poor people.",

Their low rates are a reflection of a lack of opportunity to commit these crimes because they occupy positions of trust at low levels.

Well let me say to you, when it comes to black crime, don't excuse that kind of awful behavior.\n \n As a side note (the intention of this thread is NOT to talk about causes), in Marvin Wolfgang's (one of the top criminologists in the world a generation ago) famous study of all youths in Philadelphia, he found that middle-income blacks had higher crime rates than lower-class whites. Research in general shows a greater correlation between race and street crime than social class and street crime, especially violent crime.\n\n Exactly!!! It only goes one way. Just like the liberal media. When it works in there favor \"READ ALL ABOUT IT.\" When it goes against their beliefs it goes to page nine and becomes a 150 word blurp.",

The reason may be that a black urban underclass is being left behind. \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Is crime caused by a lack of other avenues to success? Will programs designed to support stable nuclear families, increase education, and alleviate poverty also reduce the crime rate? In a 1992 issue of Criminology, sociologists Gary LaFree, Kriss Drass, and Patrick O'Day shed new light on an old debate. \n \n The authors find that for whites, poverty, lack of education, and family disruption cause higher crime rates. But for blacks, the relationship is just the opposite: Black crime rates rise as education, income, and employment rise; and crime decreases as the percentage of families headed by females increases. This flies in the face of conventional wisdom both in academic and policy circles, they say. \n \n The researchers performed two statistical analyses, a correlation and a regression model. Both show that the factors that correlate with higher rates of crime are different for blacks and whites:\n \n What the Raw Numbers Show\n The authors' correlation analysis shows that:\n \n For whites, robbery and burglary increase as income falls and unemployment rises. Falling education levels increase white robbery rates, and burglary rates go up as the percentage of households headed by females goes up. For homicide, the homicide rate goes up as the median level of education falls.\n For blacks, income and employment rates have no effect on robbery or burglary rates. Rising levels of education means higher robbery rates for blacks.\n \n For blacks, robbery and burglary rates decrease as the percentage of female-headed households increases. Rising income and employment increase black homicide rates.\n Taking Other Factors into Account\n The authors' regression analysis shows similar results. Black and white crime rates are affected differently by levels of economic well-being, education, and family stability:\n \n White Crime\n For whites, the robbery rate increases when:\n \n income falls \n inflation goes up \n there are more women working outside the home and more non-traditional households.\n The burglary rate increases when:\n \n income falls \n education levels fall \n the percentage of female-headed households rises \n inflation goes up \n there are more women working outside the home and more non-traditional households.\n The homicide rate increases when:\n \n education levels fall \n inflation goes up.\n Black Crime\n For blacks, the robbery rate increases when:\n \n income rises \n education levels rise \n the percentage of female-headed households falls \n the prison rate (percentage of the population in prison) goes up.\n The burglary rate increases when:\n \n education rises \n the percentage of female-headed household falls \n inflation rises.\n The homicide rate increases when:\n \n income rises.\n The authors call for more research to analyze why increasing opportunity leads to more, not less, crime for African-Americans. They tentatively conclude that their results may support the findings of scholars like William Julius Wilson (1987, The Truly Disadvantaged). If the African-American community is becoming increasingly divided into a well-off middle-class and a poor urban underclass, rising overall rates of education and economic opportunity for blacks may have little impact on the poorest, crime-ridden urban neighborhoods. \n \n \n \n Research Design: \n LaFree, Drass and O'Day use time-series data from 1957 to 1988 to assess how educational attainment, economic well-being, and family structure affect the rates of black and white crime. \n \n Their data on crime come from the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) system and consist of race-specific arrest rates for robbery, burglary, and homicide. They conclude that UCR data gives a good reflection of the actual number of crimes, since they compare well with available information from surveys of crime victims, and since rates of arrest are higher for more serious crimes.\n \n They use two measures of economic well-being: median family income and male unemployment. Their measure of educational attainment is median years of education for males age 25 and over. They concentrate on male unemployment and education because men predominate in committing the crimes of robbery, burglary, and homicide. Their measure of family stability is the percentage of families headed by women. All of their data on economic well-being, education and family stability come from the U.S. Bureau of the Census, and all are categorized by race (white/black).\n \n In addition, they include several control variables in their statistical models: the prison rate or the number of prisoners in federal and state prisons per 100,000 population; the Consumer Price Index as a measure of inflation; the percentage of males aged 14 to 29, included because young men commit more crimes than older men; and the Criminal Opportunity measure, an index of the proportion of households in a community with a working woman (husband present) or that are nonhusband-wife households.\n \n http://www.crime.smartlibrary.org/NewInterface/segment.cfm?segment=1661&table_of_contents=1326\n \n \n \nSo the most common factors are education and income, eh.

It Also shows that almost half never got out of high school.\n \n http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cpus97.pdf\n \n 1998 shows the same\n \n http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cpus9807.pdf\n \n \n Highlights include the following:\n \n \n 68% of State prison inmates did not receive a high school diploma\n \n About 26% of State prison inmates said they had completed the GED while serving time in a correctional facility.\n \n Although the percentage of State prison inmates who reported taking education courses while confined fell from 57% in 1991 to 52% in 1997, the number who participated in an educational program since admission increased from 402,500 inmates in 1991 to 550,000 in 1997.\n \n http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/ecp.htm\n \n \n Minority State inmates were generally less educated than\n their white peers. About 44% of black State prison inmates\n and 53% of Hispanic inmates had not graduated from high\n school or received a GED compared to 27% of whites in\n State prisons (table 7).\n \n http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/ecp.pdf\n \n There are a number of good reasons to suspect that anti-black attitudes may bolster white support for the death penalty. Over the past several decades, crime in the U.S. has become an increasingly racialized issue. The symbolic link between race and crime partly reflects the high rate of violence in poor black neighborhoods, but it also stems from the race-coded rhetoric public officials use to talk about crime and from media coverage that exaggerates black violence (Entman and Rojecki 2000, 78-93; Mendelberg 2001; Peffley, Shields, and Williams 1996). Media stories routinely convey threatening images of black crime suspects and disproportionately portray black prisoners as \"irrational, incorrigible, predatory, and dangerous\" (Sloop 1996, 116). Not surprisingly, white Americans tend to associate criminality with people of color and believe that most criminals come from racial minorities (Roberts and Stalans 1997).\n \n In this context, it seems likely that when white Americans think about questions of crime and punishment, they frame the issues partly in racial terms. Indeed, some observers have argued that white preferences for harsh sentencing should be viewed as a response to racially tinged perceptions of threat (Cohn, Barkan, and Haltman 1991). Stiff punishments may provide white Americans with a means to control or subordinate black people, or they may simply offer a way to vent anti-black resentments (Sidanius and Pratto 1999). Previous research offers some evidence for this view. Among white Americans, individuals who hold more negative beliefs about black people generally endorse more punitive responses to crime (Cohn, Barkan, and Haltman 1991). When confronted with images of black perpetrators, whites who hold anti-black stereotypes become more likely to believe in a suspect's guilt, more likely to expect recidivism, and more likely to favor harsh criminal punishments (Gilliam and Iyengar 2000; Hurwitz and Peffley 1997).\n \n In light of these findings, as well as research showing that race is highly correlated with the availability and use of capital punishment in the U.S. states (Jacobs and Carmichael 2002), it is surprising how little attention students of death penalty support have devoted to racial prejudice. There is a small amount of survey evidence indicating that anti-black attitudes may enhance white support (Barkan and Cohn 1994; Gross and Kinder 2000; Kinder and Sanders 1996). In addition, mock jury studies have found that white jurors are more likely to impose the death penalty when defendants are black rather than white and that these jurors tend to supply \"stereotype-consistent\" justifications for their sentences (Lynch and Haney 2000).\n \n Such previous findings, however, are limited in important respects. Mock jury studies offer many insights, but their nonprobability samples cannot be used to draw valid statistical inferences about the national population. Survey research typically overcomes this difficulty. But the survey-based studies to date have controlled for only a handful of demographic and attitudinal variables, and none so far have investigated the ways race-based effects may be abridged or mediated by contextual factors. As a result, there remain good reasons for skepticism about the claim that racial attitudes underpin white support for the death penalty. Supportive evidence comes from a slender base of studies that have tested for racial effects without controlling for plausible rival explanations.\n \n Why Do White Americans Support the Death Penalty?

   "On the issue of white-collar crime, I showed in the original post that blacks have higher rates of common white-collar crime than other groups. As I said most of these kinds of crimes are things like skimming money or stealing things from work. As for elite crimes, it is not a compliment to blacks to say their rates are low. Their low rates are a reflection of a lack of opportunity to commit these crimes because they occupy positions of trust at low levels. Their low rates are more a reflection of their underachievement as a group than their disinclination to commit crimes.

   "When folks like yourself whine about white racism, do you hear me saying, \"But the racists are not to be blamed: their parents raised them that way, their racists friends influenced their beliefs, they were exposed to racist literature, they are just ignorant and poor and lacking a good education.\" If I did argue that, you'd retort that I shouldn't excuse that kind of awful behavior. Well let me say to you, when it comes to black crime, don't excuse that kind of awful behavior.\n \n As a side note (the intention of this thread is NOT to talk about causes), in Marvin Wolfgang's (one of the top criminologists in the world a generation ago) famous study of all youths in Philadelphia, he found that middle-income blacks had higher crime rates than lower-class whites. Research in general shows a greater correlation between race and street crime than social class and street crime, especially violent crime.\n\n Why do all racist allegations depend on studies before pre-1969 civil rights movement? Could it be that the world was extremely racist until the 1980's? Here are some things to think about Galton. As a professor you knwo how there is no consensus and usually more current research is more credible than past.\n \n \n \n CONTEMPORARY CRITICISMS OF THE BLACK SUBCULTURE OF VIOLENCE THEORY\n \n Erlanger (1974)\n \n Until recently, Erlanger (1974) was the only investigator to directly test Wolfgang and Ferracuti's black subculture of violence model (Cao, Adams, & Jensen, 1997:368). Erlanger found that there is no major difference among blacks with regard to personal approval of interpersonal violence. In fact, he found that poor white males aged 21 to 64 are more likely to fight than poor blacks in the same age group (Erlanger, 1974: 285). \n \n Cao, Adams, & Jensen (1997)\n \n The black subculture of violence theory was more recently challenged by Liqun Cao, Anthony Adams, and Vickie J. Jensen (1997). This study examines beliefs in violence among African-Americans and tests Wolfgang and Ferracuti's hypothesis that violent values are widespread among African-Americans (Cao, Adams, & Jensen, 1997:369).\n \n According to the authors, \"[t]he subculture of violence thesis is perhaps one of the most cited, but one of the least tested, propositions in the sociological and criminological literature\"(Cao, Adams, & Jensen, 1997:367). \n \n This study was different from the ones which have been conducted since Wolfgang first developed the subculture of violence theory in that it: (1) examines blacks, instead of nonwhites; (2) uses direct measures (i.e., surveys) of subcultural values; (3) uses a nationwide representative sample to test the thesis, and (4) includes the key variables identified by Wolfgang and Ferracuti (Cao, Adams, & Jensen, 1997:369).\n \n To test the black subculture of violence theory, the authors used indexes of violent offensive and defensive values from the General Social Survey (1983-1991). A total of 3,218 people were asked whether or not they would approve of violence in response to certain hypothetical scenarios, some involving offensive situations, others involving defensive ones (Cao, Adams, & Jensen, 1997:370).\n \n They found no difference between black and white approval of violence in response to offensive situations, which is contrary to Wolfgang's theory. However, they also found that whites are significantly more likely than blacks to express their support for the use of violence in defensive situations, which is also contrary to the subculture of violence theory (Cao, Adams, & Jensen, 1997:373). \n \n In sum, the authors found that being black does not imply a greater probability of embracing a subculture of violence as measured by individuals' beliefs and attitudes. Therefore, they rejected the subculture of violence theory, insofar as it applied to African-Americans in the United States (Cao, Adams, & Jensen, 1997:376).\n \n The authors of the following final two studies argue that Wolfgang and Ferracuti erred in trying to explain the disproportionately higher rates of violence among blacks through the subculture of violence theory. They instead suggest that the true cause of the violence is the structurally disadvantaged role occupied by blacks in the U.S. \n \n Parker (1989)\n \n Parker disagrees that there is a subculture of violence that leads to increased homicide rates among blacks. Rather, he found that poverty is the most important predictor of homicide, and therefore argues that socioeconomic theoretical models of the causes of homicide are preferred to subcultural ones (Parker, 1989: 1000). \n \n [T]he structurally disadvantaged position of blacks in U.S. society can be seen as the root cause of black violence, and . . . the same causal chain results in violence among whites as well. Conceptually and empirically, the time has come to reject the use of demographic categories as adequate measures of a concept such as the subculture of violence (Parker, 1989: 1002). \n \n \n His criticisms of the black subculture of violence model are many:\n \n First, the use of global indicators describing an entire class of people, southerners or blacks, assumes that these communities are homogeneous in values and lifestyle, an assumption that is clearly false for any group as large as these groups. Second, particularly in the case of blacks, it entails an implicit pejorative indictment of urban minority residents and communities, which is unfair and racist in nature. Finally this approach ignores the role of institutionalized racism itself in producing a link between violence and racial composition (Parker, 1989: 985).\n \n \n Shihadeh & Steffensmeier (1994)\n \n The authors of this study used race-dissaggregated rates of violent crimes in 158 U.S. cities to examine the structural conditions they believe is at the root of urban black violence, specifically family structure and the effects of income inequality (Shihadeh & Steffensmeier, 1994: 735).\n \n They found that \"inequality in U.S. cities is considerably greater among blacks than in the overall city population\". Blacks not only experience higher rates of violent crime, they also suffer greater economic hardship and family disruption (Shihadeh & Steffensmeier, 1994: 737).\n \n These findings led them to argue that the black urban violence problem is best explained, not through the \"kinds of people\" analysis employed by Wolfgang and Ferracuti, but rather, by the use of a community-level perspective (i.e., one that focuses on the \"mediating dimensions of community social organization (e.g., family structure)\") (Shihadeh & Steffensmeier, 1994: 746).\n \n http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/wolfgang.htm",

And if you combine the populations of several cities neighboring Detroit, you'd see a much higher urban population with dramatically lower crime rates.\n\n \n Chapter II\n Race and Prosecutorial Discretion\n \n \n Racial profiling and other enforcement strategies begin the insidious process by which minorities are disproportionately caught up in the criminal justice system. But such disparities do not end at the point a suspect is arrested. At every subsequent stage of the criminal process -- from the first plea negotiations with a prosecutor, to the imposition of a prison sentence by a judge -- the subtle biases and stereotypes that cause police officers to rely on racial profiling are compounded by the racially skewed decisions of other key actors. This chapter examines the role of the prosecutor in perpetuating racial inequality in our criminal justice system.\n \n Prosecutors occupy a central role in American criminal justice. They represent the public in the solemn process of holding accountable those who violate society's rules. That task carries with it substantial unchecked discretion. The threshold decision of whether to bring charges against a suspect, and, if so, which charges are appropriate, is almost never subject to review by a court. The subsequent decision to enter into a plea agreement is reviewable at the margins because courts may reject plea agreements under certain circumstances. But in practice, prosecutors decide who will be granted the leniency that a plea bargain represents.\n \n Prosecutorial discretion is most dramatically exercised in the area of sentencing. Traditionally, sentencing has been a judicial prerogative, but, as will be explained, the advent of mandatory minimum sentencing laws and sentencing guideline systems has shifted in large measure the power to determine punishment from judge to prosecutor. Even where judges retain ultimate authority to impose sentence, a prosecutor's sentencing recommendation will carry great weight. Prosecutors today enjoy more power over the fate of criminal defendants than at any time in our history.\n \n Regrettably, the evidence is clear that prosecutorial discretion is systematically exercised to the disadvantage of black and Hispanic Americans. Prosecutors are not, by and large, bigoted. But as with police activity, prosecutorial judgment is shaped by a set of self-perpetuating racial assumptions.\n \n A. The Decision to Prosecute\n \n The first and most basic prosecutorial decision is whether to pursue a particular criminal case at all. Prosecutors have the authority to decline prosecution altogether, or to authorize diversion, under which completion of drug treatment or community service results in the dismissal of the charges. But such displays of prosecutorial mercy appear to be exercised in a manner that disproportionately benefits whites.\n \n In 1991 the San Jose Mercury News reviewed almost 700,000 criminal cases from California between 1981 and 1990 and uncovered statistically significant disparities at several different stages of the criminal justice process. Among the study's findings was that six percent of whites, as compared to only four percent of minorities, won \"interest of justice\" dismissals, in which prosecutors dropped a criminal case entirely. Moreover, the study found, 20 percent of white defendants charged with crimes providing for the option of diversion received that benefit, while only 14 percent of similarly situated blacks and 11 percent of similarly situated Hispanics were placed in such programs.\n \n Related to the decision to decline prosecution is the decision to charge the defendant in state or federal court. This choice is presented when jurisdiction over the crime resides concurrently in state and federal court, as in many drug cases. The police may make an initial decision of whether to bring the evidence to state or federal prosecutors (a discretionary call that may itself be influenced by racial considerations), but the authority to determine that a defendant will be federally prosecuted rests with federal prosecutors. Typically they will decline to prosecute the defendant in federal court if the case does not seem \"serious\" enough or if the defendant does not seem to pose a significant threat to public safety. Obviously these are not scientific judgments - rather they are exercises of discretion informed by predictions, hunches and preconceptions, some of which are racially tinged.\n \n The decision of whether to prosecute a drug case in federal court has important consequences for the defendant because federal sentences are notoriously harsher than state sentences. Federal parole was abolished in 1987, and federal drug convictions frequently result in lengthy, mandatory sentences. Moreover, if the prosecutor includes in the indictment charges carrying mandatory penalties and then refuses to permit a plea to other charges, the defendant has no opportunity to undergo drug treatment as an alternative to imprisonment, since federal law does not offer judges that option.\n \n According to the United States Sentencing Commission, federal courts in 1990 sentenced drug traffickers to an average of 84 months in prison, without possibility of parole. By contrast, state courts in 1988 sentenced drug traffickers to an average maximum sentence of 66 months, resulting in an average time served of only 20 months. Thus, the decision of a prosecutor to bring federal charges, rather than letting the case proceed in state court, can result in a prison term that is years longer than the sentence that would likely result from state prosecution.\n \n That the prosecutorial decision to bring charges in federal, rather than state, court is often exercised to the detriment of minorities is best demonstrated by statistics on crack cocaine prosecutions. In 1986 Congress enacted especially harsh mandatory minimum penalties for these offenses. From 1988-1994, hundreds of blacks and Hispanics - but no whites - were prosecuted by the United States Attorney's office with jurisdiction over Los Angeles County and six surrounding counties. The absence of white crack defendants in federal court could not be ascribed to a lack of whites engaged in such conduct; during the 1986-1994 period, several hundred whites were prosecuted in California state court for crack offenses.\n \n National statistics tell the same story: From 1992-1994, approximately 96.5 percent of all federal crack prosecutions were of non-whites. A 1992 U.S. Sentencing Commission Report determined that only minorities were prosecuted for crack offenses in over half of the federal judicial districts that handled crack cases. And during that period, in New York, Texas, California, and Pennsylvania combined, eight whites were convicted of crack offenses; the number of white crack defendants convicted in Denver, Boston, Chicago, Miami, Dallas and Los Angeles combined was zero, compared to thousands of convictions of black and Hispanic crack offenders.\n \n These discrepancies are remarkable because the crack epidemic knew no racial bounds. Despite stereotypes perpetuated by the media and popular culture, government statistics show that more whites overall used crack than blacks. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, between 1991 and 1993 whites were twice as likely to have used crack nationwide than blacks and Hispanics combined. Crack use was somewhat more concentrated in minority communities, but in Los Angeles, for example, whites comprised more than 50 percent of those who had ever used crack, and about one-third of those who could be termed \"frequent users.\"\n \n The exercise of prosecutorial discretion in favor of white crack defendants and against black crack defendants is illustrated by the parallel cases of two men - one white, the other black - charged with cocaine trafficking in Los Angeles. Stephen Green, a black man, was arrested with 70 grams of crack and sentenced in federal court to 10 years in prison - the mandatory minimum federal sentence for selling more than 50 grams of crack. Daniel Siemanowski, a white man, was arrested with 67 grams of crack, and was also therefore eligible for the 10-year mandatory sentence. But he was tried and convicted in state court, and received a jail sentence of less than a year.\n \n Federal law enforcement authorities have disputed that the wide discrepancy in federal crack prosecutions reflects differential treatment based on race, arguing that authorities target high-volume traffickers of whatever race. But since it is empirically true that more whites than non-whites used crack during this period, this argument presumes that whites largely bought their crack from non-whites. Studies, however, suggest the contrary - that drug users tend to purchase their drugs from individuals of the same race as the user, and that drug seller racial breakdowns are similar to drug user racial breakdowns. Of course some suburban residents drive into the inner city to buy drugs on the street, and of course those open-air street markets present an easy enforcement target for the police. But most drug deals occur behind closed doors, in offices and in private homes that the police don't patrol. Just because most of the dealers hawking crack vials on the street corner were not white in the late 1980's does not mean whites did not participate aggressively in the crack distribution network.\n \n In any event, the reality is that many black defendants prosecuted in federal court are not high-volume traffickers. According to Los Angeles federal district judge J. Spencer Letts, \"those high in the chain of drug distribution are seldom caught and seldom prosecuted.\" Instead, federal prosecutorial efforts have focused predominantly on low-volume dealers and low-level couriers who happen to be black and Hispanic. U.S. District Court Judge Consuelo B. Marshall has observed: \"We do see a lot of these [crack] cases and one does ask why some are in state court and some are being prosecuted in federal court . . . and if it's not based on race, what's it based on?\"\n \n B. Charging Decisions and Plea Bargaining\n \n Once a prosecutor decides to bring charges against an individual, plea negotiations present the next opportunity for a prosecutor to grant some degree of leniency to a defendant, or to insist on maximum punishment. Prosecutors have virtually unlimited discretion to enter into an agreement by which the defendant will plead guilty in exchange for the dismissal of certain charges or a reduced sentence, and once again the exercise of discretion is characterized by racially disparate results.\n \n  The San Jose Mercury News report discussed above revealed consistent discrepancies in the treatment of white and non-white criminal defendants at the pretrial negotiation stage of the criminal process. During 1989-1990, a white felony defendant with no criminal record stood a 33 percent chance of having the charge reduced to a misdemeanor or infraction, compared to 25 percent for a similarly situated black or Hispanic. Between 1981 and 1990, 50 percent of all whites who were arrested for burglary and had one prior offense had at least one other count dismissed, as compared to only 33 percent of similarly situated blacks and Hispanics. Blacks charged with a single offense received sentencing enhancements in 19 percent of the cases, whereas similarly situated whites received such enhancements in only 15 percent of the cases.\n Over the course of 700,000 cases, these discrepancies establish a clear pattern of unfair treatment for thousands of black and Hispanic criminal defendants. The extent of disparate treatment in individual cases can be stark indeed. Consider the fates of two individuals - one black, one white (unnamed in the Mercury News report) - each charged with four criminal counts: three counts of burglary, and one count of receiving stolen property. Neither man had been to jail before. Neither had used a weapon in the offense. Drugs were involved in neither crime. Both men entered into plea bargains. But the black man was required to plead guilty to all four criminal charges and received an eight-year sentence. The white man was permitted to plead guilty to a single burglary charge and received a sentence of 16 months.\n \n Statistics from other jurisdictions confirm that prosecutorial discretion may result in disparate treatment of minorities and whites. The State of Georgia has a \"two strikes, you're out\" law, under which a life sentence may be imposed for a second drug offense. Under the Georgia scheme, the State's district attorneys have unfettered discretion to seek this penalty. As of 1995, life imprisonment under the \"two strikes\" law had been imposed on 16 percent of eligible black defendants, while the same sentence had been imposed on only one percent of eligible white defendants. Consequently, 98.4 percent of those serving life sentences under Georgia's \"two strikes, you're out\" law are black. \n \n Statistics in federal court mirror the experiences in these states. A United States Sentencing Commission report found that, for comparable behavior, prosecutors offered white defendants plea bargains that permitted the imposition of sentences below what would otherwise be the statutory minimum more often than they offered such deals to blacks or Hispanic defendants. Moreover, federal prosecutors have sole authority to grant a departure below the mandatory minimum level based on substantial assistance to authorities, another means by which leniency may be offered to some defendants and not others.\n \n C. Bail\n \n Another turning point in the criminal justice process, one that can mean the difference between freedom and incarceration for criminal defendants, is the bail determination. While the decision to set bail is ultimately a judicial function, prosecutors play an important role in determining whether a criminal defendant will be released on bail or detained in jail prior to trial by recommending detention or release.\n \n A New York State study examined the extent to which black and Hispanic criminal defendants were treated differently from similarly situated white criminal defendants with respect to pretrial detention, and concluded that statewide, minorities charged with felonies were detained more often than white defendants charged with felonies. Indeed, the study found that 10 percent of all minorities held in jail at felony indictment in New York City, and 33 percent of all minorities held in jail at felony indictment in the rest of New York State, would be released before arraignment if minorities were detained as often as comparably situated whites.\n \n Another study reviewed bail determinations for criminal defendants in New Haven, Connecticut, and concluded that the bail rates set for black defendants exceeded those set for similarly situated white defendants. In short, the study concluded, lower bail rates could have been set for black defendants without incurring the risk of flight that bail rates are designed to avoid. And federal statistics indicate that while non-Hispanics are likely to be released prior to trial in 66 percent of cases, Hispanics are likely to be released only 26 percent of the time.\n \n Bail status not only determines whether the defendant is to be incarcerated before trial, it also bears on the likelihood of conviction. Although jurors are not supposed to know whether the defendant has been jailed before trial, they can often discern the defendant's bail status and are more likely to convict a defendant who has already been incarcerated. Here again, one racial disparity begets disparity further along in the justice system.\n \n D. The Death Penalty\n \n Thirty-eight states and the federal government authorize capital punishment. In each of those jurisdictions it is the prosecutor who makes the critical decision of whether or not to seek death. That decision is guided somewhat by statutory aggravating and mitigating factors, but many of these factors, such as the heinousness of the crime, are subjective. Judges and juries may eventually reject a prosecutor's request that the death penalty be imposed, but prosecutors alone decide whether death is an option.\n \n The importance of race as a factor in the imposition of capital punishment is well documented. First, the evidence reveals disparity in the application of the death penalty depending on the race of the victim. Individuals charged with killing white victims are significantly more likely to receive the death penalty than individuals charged with killing non-white victims. Of numerous studies of death penalty outcomes reviewed by the congressional General Accounting Office (GAO), 82 percent found that imposition of the death penalty was more likely in the case of a white victim than in the case of a black victim. One of the most thorough death penalty studies, conducted by Professors David Baldus, Charles Pulaski, and George Woodworth, found that defendants charged in Georgia with killing white victims were 4.3 times more likely to receive the death penalty than defendants charged with killing black victims. The Baldus study also found that more than 50 percent of those sentenced to death for killing a white person would not have received the death penalty had they killed a black person. According to the GAO, the effect of the victim's race on the sentencing outcome appears to be particularly pronounced at the earlier stages of the judicial process, such as the prosecutor's decision to charge the defendant with a capital offense and then whether or not to accept a guilty plea to lesser charges.\n \n Second, while some of the evidence concerning the death penalty reveals that the race of the defendant alone does not result in unwarranted disparity, other evidence is to the contrary. It is at least true that the race of the defendant, when combined with the race of the victim, yields significant disparities in the application of the death penalty. The Baldus study concluded that blacks who killed whites were sentenced to death 22 times more frequently than blacks who killed blacks, and seven times more frequently than whites who killed blacks. Again, this discrepancy appears to hinge on the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Georgia prosecutors sought the death penalty in 70 percent of the cases involving black defendants and white victims, while seeking the death penalty in only 19 percent of the cases involving white defendants and black victims, and only 15 percent of the cases involving black defendants and black victims.\n \n In short, black defendants charged with killing white victims were the group most likely to receive the death penalty. Until 1991, when Donald Gaskins, a white man, was executed in South Carolina for the murder of a black victim, no white person had been executed for the murder of a black person since the Supreme Court's 1976 decision in Furman v. Georgia holding that capital punishment is not necessarily unconstitutional. In all, since 1976, only 11 whites have been executed for the murder of a black victim, while 145 blacks have been executed for the murder of a white victim, and 80 percent of those currently on death row are there for killing a white person. And the Baldus Study revealed that of the seven individuals executed in Georgia between 1976 and 1986, all were convicted of killing whites, and six of them were black, despite the fact that of all homicides in Georgia during that period, only 9.2 percent involved black defendants and white victims, and 60.7 percent involved black victims.\n \n Still other studies indicate that capital punishment is disproportionately applied on the basis of the race of the criminal defendant, irrespective of the race of the victim. Professors Baldus and Woodsworth, co-authors of the groundbreaking Georgia study, conducted a statistical analysis of the death sentence in Philadelphia between 1983 and 1993, and concluded that for similar crimes, black defendants were almost four times more likely to receive the death penalty as white defendants, and that 38 percent of black defendants sentenced to death would not have been so sentenced had they been white.\n \n Statistics on the imposition of the federal death penalty are similarly disturbing. In 1988, Congress enacted the first federal death penalty provision in the aftermath of Furman. The 1988 law authorized the death penalty for murders committed by those involved in certain drug trafficking activities under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7848. From 1988 to 1994, 75 percent of those convicted under 21 U.S.C.\u00a7848 were white. However, of those who were the subject of death penalty prosecutions under that law in the same period, 89 percent were Hispanic or black (33 out of 37) and only 11 percent (four out of 37) were white. And, indeed, the first defendant scheduled to be executed under the 1988 law is Hispanic.\n \n A congressional subcommittee studied the application of the 1988 law and concluded that \"some of the death penalty prosecutions under [21 U.S.C. \u00a7848] have been against defendants who do not seem to fit the expected 'drug kingpin' profile,\" including, in several cases, \"young inner-city drug gang members and relatively small-time traffickers,\" or individuals who committed murder at the behest of a higher-up who received a lesser sentence.\n \n Under federal procedures, the personal written authorization of the Attorney General is required before a capital prosecution may proceed. Thus, the application of the federal death penalty involves the exercise of prosecutorial discretion at the highest levels of the United States Government. Nobody suggests that the current Attorney General or her predecessors who authorized federal death penalty prosecutions are or were motivated by impermissible racial factors. But this act of prosecutorial decision-making, like others at all levels of government, is subject to institutional and community pressures that may have racial overtones.\n \n As an empirical matter, it is undeniable that prosecutors exercise their discretion in ways that have racially disproportionate impacts, even if their intent is race-neutral. Such unfairness may ultimately be more dangerous than explicitly racist behavior, since it is harder to detect (both by victim and perpetrator) and harder to eradicate than the blatant racism most Americans have learned to reject as immoral. In any event, prosecutorial decision-making, in tandem with police tactics, contribute to the criminalization of race and the racialization of crime, a vicious cycle that is having a devastating effect on minority communities throughout the nation.\n \n \n http://www.civilrights.org/publications/reports/cj/prosecutorial.html",

Since blacks suffer the most due to those factors it's expected that they have a larger crime problem.\n\n \n You've already tried to ride that horse and the statistics don't bear it out. There are MORE poor whites and MORE uneducated whites in the US than poor, uneducated blacks.\n \n\n Also blacks are convicted more frequetly than whites as my previous psots indicated. Prosecutors choose to proseute more blacks and there is more racial profiling leading to more arrests of blacks. \n\n That's a chicken and egg scenario IMO. If you're looking for criminals, you target those most likely to be criminals. Do you search for Al Qaeda terrorists amongst old white women or do you concentrate on young Middle Eastern males? To me \"profiling\" is just playing the odds.\n \n\n Also the innocence project has freed mostly blacks. About 75% of vindicated inmates are black. There also is more evidenc of coercion of black suspects.\n\n And how many blacks out ofd the whole prison population does that 75% represent? 0.1%? 1%? It's a fact that obfuscates the truth, not enlightens it unless you also give its total impact. 75% of 4 people is only 3 and hardly significant, for example; 75% of 100,000 is 75,000 and THAT would be significant.\n \n\n All these are factors that show contribute to the crime problem. It's alright though if you keep thinking it's racial. There is nothing to support that.\n\n I think that the problem is very complex and at the root is the high rate of illgetimate births in the urban black community. We created a culture in which single women were rewarded for NOT getting married through welfare, subsidized housing, food stamps, etc., so it was more economically practical to NOT have a male in the house. As a result, we wound up with a \"Lord of the Flies\" situation that continues today; single, poor black mothers raising violent kids unchecked.\n And, to be fair, the same occurs, but to a lesser degree with PWT.",

   "How do I explain this matter without you calling me a stereo typer?\n\n \n I will admit that I see myself unwittingly using stereotypes. I don't propose to be an arrogant jerk about this matter in the least. I merely am pointing out that on the one hand you decry the cops for using racial profiling based on their supposed stereotypes but on the other hand you claim all of the cops in your area behave a certain way. Unless you have the objective facts to back that up, that is stereotyping no matter how you cut it. \n \n So if you can provide me with details regarding the ratio of out-of-state cars driven by African-Americans stopped for no either no reason or a trivial reason (e.g. a broken headlight), to out-of-state cars driven by African-Americans stopped for a good reason, to out-of-state cars driven by African-Americans not stopped that would be a good start. Also, could you have that information broken down by officer so we can evaluate each as an individual? \n \n If after looking at all this information, it turns out that every out-of-state African American is stopped for no reason or a trivial reason and that every cop in the local force does this I will personally apologize. I will fly to New Hampshire, take you out to dinner at the best restaurant in town, wash, wax and detail your vehicle of choice (except for an 18-wheeler), and stand in your town square shouting my remorse over publically slurring your good name.\n \n However, if you cannot provide this information you need to admit your subjective experience has been that out-of-state African-Americans are unfairly stopped by the local police force. You must also admit that this subjective experience may not, in fact, reflect the reality of the situation (you could add that it might, but you have no evidence to support that contention) and by characterizing all members of the police force as engaging in racial profiling you were, in fact, relying on a stereotype of their work. \n \n The worst situation for you would be to find that information and realize it doesn't back up your proposition. In that case, I would suggest finding the officers and apologize for publically slandering them by insinuating they are racial bigots. \n \n \n Whistler\n \n \n \nSo the first step for you in life is under stand were someone is coming from before you start your arrogant talk.\n Thanks for the advice, my friend.

   " You've already tried to ride that horse and the statistics don't bear it out. There are MORE poor whites and MORE uneducated whites in the US than poor, uneducated blacks.\n\n Though the rates are higher among blacks. Also taht blacks are convicted more frequently and for longer snetences than whites. Also I showed that the poor is overrpesented in prison. Does that mean poor are failing America?\n \n \n \n\n That's a chicken and egg scenario IMO. If you're looking for criminals, you target those most likely to be criminals. Do you search for Al Qaeda terrorists amongst old white women or do you concentrate on young Middle Eastern males? To me \"profiling\" is just playing the odds.\n\n No it's not. It becomse self fulfillign prophecies. The problem with law enforcement is that they are usually oen color and their only interaction with the other is negative hence they beleive the whole race or the race in general is bad because of their experience. They don't ever think that their interaction is because of their job. If you don't believe it then research it out. Remember I haven't been wrong yet on my research.\n \n \n \n\n And how many blacks out ofd the whole prison population does that 75% represent? 0.1%? 1%? It's a fact that obfuscates the truth, not enlightens it unless you also give its total impact. 75% of 4 people is only 3 and hardly significant, for example; 75% of 100,000 is 75,000 and THAT would be significant.\n\n Up to date there have been over 1,000 for NY. I don't know nationwide but it's higher than you think. Also I already show you the inequality in prosecution.\n \n \n \n\n I think that the problem is very complex and at the root is the high rate of illgetimate births in the urban black community. We created a culture in which single women were rewarded for NOT getting married through welfare, subsidized housing, food stamps, etc., so it was more economically practical to NOT have a male in the house. As a result, we wound up with a \"Lord of the Flies\" situation that continues today; single, poor black mothers raising violent kids unchecked.\n And, to be fair, the same occurs, but to a lesser degree with PWT. \n\n I believe there are problems in the black community. I believe that there are problems that are economic more than cultural. I believe trying to say blacks are losers or have more porblems than the rest goes to show your prejudice and bias.
