   "Would we have achieved better results in bringing Al-Qaeda to justice if we had not reacted militarily but rather treated 9/11 as a criminal act and gone after Bin Laden & Co with a smaller force of special forces acting on information from intelligence agencies and extant police investigations from around the world?\n \n Al-Qaeda has been a global phenomenon interms of its ideology and especially in terms of its funding since its inception. Rather than concentrating on bombing the XXXX out of one already devastated country, then another, we could have gone after the networks of terrorist cells across the world with a fraction of the manpower, and we would not be embroiled in a conflict claiming the lives of thousands of young men and women.\n \n Regardless of the fact that they refused to hand him over, declaring war on the Taliban did not achieve much in the way of justice for 9/11. Justice for 9/11, in my view, would involve punishing purely those involved in the organisation and funding of the attacks (and previous ones such as 1993 WTC bombings, USS Cole, various embassies), and not punishing (intentionally or not) the ordinary people of Afghanistan and Iraq who had nothing to do with it.\n \n As the 9/11 terrorists and AQ in general are a disparate mass of extremists from many different countries, why does it make sense to attack a single nation using an overwhelming military force? \n \n I don't want to hear the usual guff about liberating these people from tyrants, I am purely talking about the effectiveness of our strategy against the Al-Qaeda organisation/ideology, and nothing more.",

   "IMO our strategy against Al Qaeda, and I'm referring to the Bin Laden headed group, not resistance in Iraq or other affiliates, is sadly conventional and doomed to failure for quite some time. \n \n While conventional data processing funding transfers and traditional telephone/Internet communication have been curtailed by a massive concentration of resources (including a loss of US civil liberties), those measures have had little effect on Al Qaeda's operational funding or communications. For centuries Asia and the ME have used money changers as a means of wealth transfer between geographically separated exchanges, building reputations of confidentiality strengthened by not only tribal cultures, but in the case of Pakistan (a traditional center for money exchange) what Westerners would call the underworld. Death to extended families for default is difficult to pacify with a witness protection plan. Communications from Bin Laden to the next level of are also handled on a personal courier basis (thanks to the publicity of satellite tracking), with one-time scrambled sat telephones taking over from there, cell phones from there. \n \n Then there's the issue of cell structure within the organization itself. With two levels being the absolute depth of communication, money and information, penetration faces an almost impossible barrier. This isn't a situation of money determining loyalty as was common during cold war spy games and current disclosure of state secrets, we're back to extended families and cultural retaliation against those families for ratting someone out. How does one place an agent in such an organization where there's nowhere to go and certain, unpleasant death to dozens if not hundreds of family members for disloyalty? \n \n Al Qaeda has stated its mission as financially breaking the US to eliminate US ME presence and foreign policy (support of Israel and the Sauds). There is no defined time frame. There is displayed patience. The US is now spending 25%+ of annual budget on military expenses, on a deficit basis. In an internal transaction, credit driven consumer economy with abnormal payment imbalance, even the optimist has to realize that can't endlessly continue. We're playing their game.\n \n I've not included US conventional or quick strike specialty military as I don't see the ability to escalate use of those resources to eliminate Al Qaeda without risking full war in the ME. Iraq is keeping us well occupied with bad global PR. \n \n In deference to your request, I won't comment on US leadership.",

   "IMO our strategy against Al Qaeda, and I'm referring to the Bin Laden headed group, not resistance in Iraq or other affiliates, is sadly conventional and doomed to failure for quite some time...\n\n \n And another, further problematic aspect is the ideological one. According to the book simply titled \"Al-Qaeda\" by prize-winning ME reporter Jason Burke, there is very little communication at all, with the martyrdom anti-infidel ideology being the main factor. Burke has spent a decade travelling through the ME, and while I can't give quotes (I've lent the book to a friend!) one of the most striking passages is where he sums up all he's learnt about Al-Qaeda in the era after their \"headquarters\" in Afghanistan has been essentially put out of operation by military action there. It runs along these lines:\n \n The Al-Qaeda network now is almost similar to the way the film industry works in Hollywood; a scriptwriter contacts a producer with his latest creation, and if the producer thinks the film will make money, he hires a director and the film is made, or the scriptwriter is dismissed. Similarly, in this \"new\" Al-Qaeda, through an endless variety of underground communication channels, which differ with every operation, a group of hitherto unknown extremists will be put in contact with a rich patron who shares the ideology, who will consider the plan that the group has come up with, and will decide whether or not to help them financially. \n \n Like the London bombers, most of these groups are young Muslim men who have become \"radicalised\" by a combination of disgust at injustice and the increasing popularity of radical Islam, with no ties, even vaguely, to the men who went to Afghanistan in the 80s to fight off the Russians, and became the original Al-Qaeda. We do not yet know if their operation even required much funding, but a recent news story has revealed that one of the bombers left behind over \u00a3100,000 which none of his friends or relatives knew about.\n \n Additionally, the second group of London bombers who failed, failed because their bombs simply did not work. It is not hard to realise that these men had had something like that in mind for a while, had made their own explosives with no outside help, and were spurred on by the first bombers and just decided to go for it with no external encouragement or coercion.\n \n How can we possibly fight this ideology unilaterally or militarily?\n \n \n \nAl Qaeda has stated its mission as financially breaking the US to eliminate US ME presence and foreign policy (support of Israel and the Sauds). There is no defined time frame...\n\n \n And this central, vitally important fact is continually ignored by politicians and the media alike.\n \n \nIn deference to your request, I won't comment on US leadership.\n\n \n I am not sure, given their history, that we can say with certainty that the American people want democracy, or would be able to cope with it. Their allegiances are essentially tribal, and they respect a strong militaristic leader who can hold the country together.",

If what you want is more of the same, Bush is doing a GREAT job.
