Language's primary goal is for communication. We also don't tend to write everything in legal terms, you know...hundred page documents just to say one simple thing. Why? Efficiency. While your strict definitions of the words in the phrase are an interesting exercise in logic, it doesn't take into account that language isn't an absolutely perfect form of communication. \n \n Here is one definition:\n Law: A term normally used in technology for an extreme form of theory that claims absolute predictability of cause and effect, as presented in formal scientific statements such as Newton's Laws of Gravitation. Practical experience indicates that the only true law is that there are no absolute laws, since all events are infinitely interlinked in the total field, and all cause/effect chains are subject to infinite regress. In practice, 'laws' are best understood as useful guidelines, describing probable performance to a high, but never absolute, degree of certainty. \n \n Best understood as useful guidelines and not for semantic word abuse.\n \n \n Re-stated: \"There are no absolutes\"\n \n Are you suggesting that everyone saying this is denying that 2+2=4? Do you think that's what's being communicated? No, I don't think they are. I think they are saying \"aside from these things over here, things like evil and good, don't seem to be absolutes.\" It's a phrase, it is efficient to say it with the understanding that someone won't make a tiresome interperetation of it.\n \n Absolute is too strong a word using your strict definition (That doesn't seem to be an absolute definition), but good luck changing the phrase. \"Most things are imprecise\". Great, but sorry, language requires understanding culture, especially in the case of one sentence describing a very complex idea.\n \n Here's another one:\n \"In the study of logic, something observed similarly by most observers, or something agreed upon, or which has the same value each time measured. \"\n \n \"The only absolute is that there are no other absolutes\".\n \n It's just semantic games. I think I understand the meaning, and I don't need a 20 page thread to describe it.\n \n I do like your style (in general not this thread), I just disagree with this particular line of reasoning, and it's being directed towards \"science\".\n \n I would like to meet these scientists that forgo the typical use of the word \"theory\", and use \"fact\", or \"absolute\" instead. \n \n -Mach",

I have argued this point logically for a while now. \n \n The two statements are contradictory and therefore apply the fallacy of inconsistency. Therefore, illogical. No absolutes is disproven by proving the existence of even one absolute. If you state there is only one absolute and that is that there are no absolutes, the first half disproves the second.\n \n Similarly, if there are absolutes then there must be at least two. 1) There are absolutes. 2) Anything else that is not #1 but is still absolute. \n \n The question of whether or not we can know what the absolutes are.....NOW that is a different situation all together and quite arguable.",
