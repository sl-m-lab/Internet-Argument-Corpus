   "Yes, capitalism is greed.\n \n It's also lust, not to mention envy, pride, lust, sloth, gluttony and wrath.\n \n Greed is wanting more than we have or need, the thing that drives capitalists.\n \n Envy is a form of greed, wanting what others have even if we don't need what they have.\n \n Lust is desire for what we don't have, another form of greed.\n \n Pride is being proud just because we have more than others or we have something they wish they had, another driving force of capitalists.\n \n Sloth is getting something without having to work for it. Capitalists especially love being slothful. They dream of having enough money to never have to work.\n \n Gluttony. Hah! Just take a look at most of the top capitalists! Big, fat, gluttonous pigs!\n \n Wrath. Always being angry because you think you aren't getting what you want and deserve. Just look at how angry capitalists are if workers want to get a decent wage for their work.\n \n Nevertheless, all of these forms of greed are a driving force for the human race. Properly governed, it's what drives an economy and I think that regulated capitalism is an excellent idea.\n \n And, I'm a leftist Democrat. And, I'm sold on the concept of capitalism.

   "Theoretically, \"managed\" or regulated capitalism will allow everyone to enjoy a bit of greed.\nTheoretically capitalism would do the same as well. The odd thing is, the more \"managed\" our system gets the more greedy we have seen people. Why? Because the person(s) doing the managing are not noble and will do things to benefit themselves and their friends. \"Theoretically\" a strength in numbers would self manage capitalism. This doesn't exactly work all the time (thus child labor laws) but the other opposite does the same thing as we are seeing now. Do you know how much regulation we had on the banks prior to their collapse? What on earth makes you think that adding more will solve the problem? It never has. \n \n Being in accounting I see changes in accounting rules every year. People work around the rules to achieve their desire. It is a sad fact of humanity that we are inherently selfish. \n \n So how do you solve the problem without changing humanity? Basically you can't but you can run a limited regulation government. Pick very minimal ideas that you want to protect and restrict business that way. These ideas should only be picked so they benefit the business and population.

   "That there wasn't a rational, cogent or viable element to any of that rhetorical tirade you just laid out. I don't even know where to start with you - your thoughts are a dime short of a nickle... looking for a dollars worth of common sense here, meaning your train of thoughts are fundamentally at a deficit to start. I know one way we could save tax dollars is to end public funding of the school system, if this is all we are going to get out of it. There is no constitutional proviso for it... so down with the gavel I say if we cannot get more than coffeehouse socialism out of it.\n \n The word capitalism... means productivity as it relates to what type of economic engine we have here. Secondly you cannot call capitalism greed, greed is a behavior, capitalism is an economic methodology. Our system requires people to be free to use their God given gifts to participate in one of two ways... as an entrepreneur or employee. We reward entrepreneurialism for its many benefits to society at large as well as the jobs it provides and should be vigorously defended against the onslaught of idealogical misinterpretation going on. Minds of your ilk look at employers as the second great satan... you guys got get that straight. What we have here is brilliant but not perfect. But taking all things into consideration it is the most effective system ever devised to a self governing people... and it has made a living mockery out of the leftist intelligentsia opposing it for no sound or rational reason.",

   "Of course it's greed! It's not fair that somebody's rich just because he didn't act like a jackass in high school! It's not fair that he's rich just because he did his homework and made good grades! It's not fair that he's rich just because he put some effort in to life! What the hell is wrong with these people?! Who do they think they are to reach their true potential?!",
