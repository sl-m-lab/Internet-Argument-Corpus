Analyses that controlled for several measures of resource deprivation, urbanization, aggravated assault, robbery, unemployment, and alcohol consumption found that states with higher rates of household firearm ownership had significantly higher homicide victimization rates for children, and for women and men. In these analyses, states within the highest quartile of firearm prevalence had firearm homicide rates 114% higher than states within the lowest quartile of firearm prevalence. Overall homicide rates were 60% higher. The association between firearm prevalence and homicide was driven by gun-related homicide rates; non-gun-related homicide rates were not significantly associated with rates of firearm ownership. \n \n These results suggest that it is easier for potential homicide perpetrators to obtain a gun in states where guns are more prevalent. \"Our findings suggest that in the United States, household firearms may be an important source of guns used to kill children, women and men, both on the street and in their homes,\" said Miller. .... \" \n \n States With Higher Levels of Gun Ownership Have Higher Homicide Rates - January 11, 2007 -2007 Releases - Press Releases - Harvard School of Public Health\n \n Keep a gun in your house, kill your wife or child...or your neighbours'!",

People like NATO think that if you favor any kinds of controls or have an opinion that differs in any way, then you are for mass gun control. I pointed out earlier that accidents do lead to injuries from firearms, and that if one didn't have that firearm, they couldn't have gotten injured from it.
