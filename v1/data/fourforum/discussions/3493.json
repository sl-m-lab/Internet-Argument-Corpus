   "Well the Liberal Party doesn't seem to mesh with the Canadian definition. A lot of the policies seem more socialistic than liberal. I've heard that they are considered the \"government\" party of Canada because except for a few brief Conservative stints they've been in power the entire time. Now that they are a Minority, they are having to give in to demands from the Conservatives, Bloc Quebecois, and NDP or risk a vote of Non-Confidence. Things are a bit weird right now.",

   "Your absolutely correct. Not all people fit into a select few molds as Waxy would have you believe. You can't beat a square peg into a round hole.\n \n .......... Thank you. Can I take it then that you agree that labels are generally fuzzy and difficult to apply with accuracy? \n \n Do I believe democrats think they are evil or \"summon Satan,\" of coarse not. I won't even crack a joke as previously predicted. Although Marilyn Mason, a stunch liberial,wouldmake it easy to defy your claim.\n \n ............ I reread my post and could find no joke predictions. In fact, no predictions at all. What claim did I make that would be \"easy to defy\"?\n \n \n I do think that some of the ideas liberials support lead to evil and decete though. You want specifics, OK, how about encouraging teens to get abortions without notifying their parents. This is encouraging teens to lie and not face the reality dealing with their parents response. Is this the reality we wish to encourage in our future workforce. If you encourage kids to hide the truth about something as serious as an abortion, how will they handle later situations in life? Hide the truth as they were taught before or face the consiquenses of their actions?\n \n ............ I recall something about requiring physicians to notify parents before performing an abortion on a minor. Sounds reasonable to me, did this pass?\n \n How about wealth redistribution? That is evil to the core. It legalizes robbery. Robin Hood made it sound honorable and valient, but that does not take away the fact that you take money from someone and give it to another. If it happens onthe street it is illegal but, if the government does it, then its OK? BS! There is a thread going on right now concerning estate taxes that tackles this very issue. Keep your hands out of my pockets.\n \n ............. Are you implying that wealth redistribution by the government is solely a Liberal enterprise? In the recent debates, the \"Compassionate Conservative\" made a point of noting the increases that he has made to programs. I submit that politicians of every stripe are feeding at the trough of borrowed money and no party has a corner on ethics. Please be assured that your pockets will never feel my hand.\n \n \n Liberials are notoriously week on crime which directly results in evil on our streets. Mental instituions for murders proofs my point. They may very well be sick, but how does that excuse them from murder? \n \n ............. This notority has escaped me. Mental defect provisions are on the books in all the states, are all states liberal? \n \n \n Again I don't believe Demoncrats, excuse me, Democrats are intentionally practicing evil. I do believe their ideas lead good honest folks to deal with evil. If that makes me \"stupid\" then sobeit. At least I'm not a theif,murderer, or liar.\n\n \n ............. \"Demoncrats\", that's cute, sounds like you have been listening to talk radio. I have never implied that you are stupid, that would not be my judgement. I have no idea why \"theif, murderer or liar\" came into this exchange.\n \n ........... It appears to me that Liberal to you is anyone that does not share your beliefs and opinions. It is probable that many who would consider themselves Liberal actually share many of the same beliefs and values as you do. That is why painting the \"L\" word with such a broad brush is not a good thing in my opinion.\n Dono",

You must not be looking very hard :) - would you like a few examples of those who are? If the \"middle class\" thinks only the rich will pay for a tax increase, they're usually all for it.
