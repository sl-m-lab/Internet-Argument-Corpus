   "Evolution needs not only random mutations but a mechanism of selection that can either propogate a mutation to the entire species or condemn it to oblivion. I wonder then how our modern life, with its ease of survival and medical advancements, has changed the course of evolution. Are there still factors that determine whether one has a greater chance of having surviving offspring than another? If so, how do you think our species might change in, say, 10000 years (assuming we don't destroy ourselves before then)?\n \n Note:\n I realize that this may not be the perfect forum in which to pose this question since this is a forum discussing ID vs Evolution, but I thought that I would find many people knowledgable or at least interested in Evolution in this thread and it seems to be far more visited than the Science and Math forum.",
