I'm not a big fan of deficit spending but as a percentate of the national GDP it has been static at about 65%; maybe have even declined a bit. Japan's is at 170% and they seem to be surviving.

We found that was illusory. Even Bill Clinton believed that and sat on his hands throughout his presidency although he had 10 chances to kill bin Laden.

   "I tried explaining my view on the war in Iraq to a friend the other day and it didn't really get anywhere but I'll try here as it relates to some comments made.\n \n First off, I think it is pretty widely accepted that the current state of our plan in Iraq is just not working. That is step 1. Step 2 is what to do about it and you have three choices: 1)Get out 2)Stay the course 3)Change the Plan. Option 2 is not exactly a smart one as we already accepted this to be not working. This leaves us with 1 and 3. Personally, I don't think the US has the balls to handle option 3 even if it would be better for the country. Changing the plan would have to be going to a strategy of doing what it takes to win. This obviously has to involve such tactics that are considered inhumane. These tactics were used in every war until just after Vietnam. You could probably claim the mass media gained better access to the war in Vietnam and reported things such as torture and other inhumane tactics which make people sick and disgusted with our military. This is irrelevant though because those tactics work. Wars are nasty and sometimes you gotta do bad things if you want to win. In WWII we would bomb a school if there were an AA gun next to it. You'd kill instead of taking a prisoner. You'd take out homes if you thought the enemy MIGHT be in there. It was nasty...many civilians died. However, we won. In Iraq it might mean that if someone blew up a Humvee then we take out the entire town. This is what it may take to win. Am I saying we should do this? No, I'm just saying thats what its gonna have to take. \n \n In conclusion, the US is either going to have to grow a pair or get out, but when the time comes for a real war I'd hope that we have a leader is not a wimp like the US public is now.",

   "200 killed yesterday, Baghdad under curfew with airport closed and more violence promised by his supporters if Maliki meets with Bush in Jordan. Chaos is an apt description by this article:\n \n http://www.time.com/time/world/artic...562867,00.html\n \n I don't think anyone with a shred of intelligence can deny US actions have created anything but a nightmare for all involved that will eventually involve Iran, Turkey and Syria. what do other posters think the US should do with our example of nation building?\n \n 1. Leave\n 2. Stay the course\n 3. Add more troops\n \n My opinion is write the check for infrastructure damage we created, a big one, immediately pulling all troops and contractors. At $9-billion/mo direct costs and $40-billion/mo or so hidden and flow-through that would create an economic impact making it the least desirable to current administration, but I say it's time to bite that bullet and put the US first.\n\n \n OK, first, purely in response to the original post;\n \n 1) If we just leave the consequences will be complex:\n * To start with, Iraq will enter a truly horrifying, likely genocidal, sectarian civil war and we will likely see, ten/twenty years from now a similar situation to Afghanistan.\n \n * What do I mean by this? Over a decade after the soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, after a decade of billions of dollars in military aid from both the USSR and the USA during the 80s, an entire generation of Afghans had grown up knowing either very little or literally nothing but conflict and Islam. This led directly to the development of the violent, Islamist Taliban as a powerful force and indirectly (although this is controversial and difficult to substantiate) the growth of Al-Qaeda.\n \n *Afghanistan's basic national infrastructure was destroyed in the first few years of conflict; the same has happened in Iraq, with the same consequences, as minority extremists fill the dissolute power vacuum: There is no guarantee of personal security, no local government tied to the national government, no political or religious freedom without threat of death, no measurable improvement of basic utiltities.\n \n *If we just up and leave, the Shi'a/Sunni sectarian war will only intensify and will likely spread to include the Kurds, whose territories include the majority of Iraqi oil fields {link rquires Adobe Acrobat}; this being the reason that their region has seen the least violence. Our soldiers may not be able to keep the peace but 'at least' they provide a non-domestic target for the various groups. Without our presence the civil war can only escalate.\n \n *However, option number\n 2) Stay the course(without adding more troops) , is equally destructive in my opinion. The Iraqis on all sides have demonstrated their hatred of us time and time again. At the time of writing there are on average 180 \n attacks on coalition troops daily. 180 daily attacks is not a sporadic terrorist campaign, it is a genuine war of attrition. The same article claims that the insurgents have become self-sufficient through kidnap ransom and oil smuggling. \n \n *Ensconced within miltary bases and Persian Gulf Aircraft Carriers, our forces are able to annihilate any major incursion, but we are unable to deal with small-scale bombings without resorting to totally disproportionate retaliation; this possibly being the primary cause for the Iraqis' hatred of our armed forces.\n \n *Option number\n 3) in my opinion, will just add fuel to the fire, unless we gain a genuine UN mandate, which must include Syria and Iran as proponents and ratifiers for it to have any credence among the Iraqi people as, like it or not, these nations clearly have more credibiliy with Iraqis (or any arabs) than the western nations do. However this is unlikely as neither of these countries posess the infrastructure to support and develop the failed state that Iraq has become over the past few years. Such a mandate would additionally necessitate a specific,fair and binding Israel/Palestine peace accord which is as unlikely today as it was 10, 20 or 60 years ago. \n \n * In short, and this is particularly addressed to Missouri Mule: No, I don't have a solution. The administration you so obviously support has led the US/UK alliance into a lose/lose situation. We have created a failed state which is on the brink of civil war and I can see no way for us to extricate ourselves without fostering yet more hatred. If we stay, we will be blamed for Iraq's degeneration; if we leave, we will be similarly blamed.\n \n *Given these two options, my response would be to get all our troops out, concentrate on border defense (both Iraqi and domestic) and therefore limit the loss of life to those within our own countries. We cannot reverse the legacy of the terrible errors we have made in invading Iraq, we can only try to make the best of the consequences.\n \n \n\n Even if it could be persuasively argued that we fell into a trap in Iraq, what was the purpose of 9/11? According to bin Laden it is to bring about the downfall of western civilization. And if we don't submit then we will have our heads lopped off.\n \n I think the idea that we are being financially broken is preposterous. We have no higher national debt to GDP than when we entered the war.\n\n \n *As Georged points out, if you subtract defecit spending from your internal economy you have negative GDP, a shrinking economy. Virtually all your spending on defense (which has, as I am sure you know, massively increased since 9/11) is based on defecit spending. \n \n *Bin Laden has repeatedly stated that his goal is the economic, not the military ruination of the Western world.\n \n \nIt is simply not the case that there was no connection between al Queda and Iraq. That has been well documented. What is not clear is whether Saddam played any part in 9/11.\n\n \n *No, what has been well documented by the 9/11 commission is that 'bin Laden \"explored possible cooperation with Iraq\" while in Sudan through 1996, but that \"Iraq apparently never responded\" to a bin Laden request for help in 1994. The commission cited reports of contacts between Iraq and al Qaeda after bin Laden went to Afghanistan in 1996, adding, \"but they do not appear to have resulted in a collaborative relationship. Two senior bin Laden associates have adamantly denied that any ties existed between al Qaeda and Iraq. We have no credible evidence that Iraq and al Qaeda cooperated on attacks against the United States.\" '\n Al Qaeda-Hussein Link Is Dismissed \n \n \nWith Iran continually pushing the envelope, what is going to happen if they shoot one of their rockets at Israel and Israel dumps their 200-400 nukes on top of Iran?\n\n \n *What's going to happen? Lots of Arabs and Jews will die. While I'm not exactly happy about that, I also tend to think 'so what?'. It's not worth innocent people from MY country travelling over there to sort out a war that started 60 years ago for genuinely (no matter the reasons today) imperialistic reasons. \n \n *There are people dying by the million all over the world, but why are we so concerned about the ME as opposed to central Africa? Could it be the oil upon which our economy rests? Surely not...\n \n \n\n But you are dodging the ultimate question. What are we to do if we pull out and THEN we get hit with a nuke? Do we go back in or do we actually nuke Iraq as you suggested earlier?\n \n I've never heard a reputable expert on the ME who believes and has said we can just abandon Iraq to the terrorists. Have you?\n\n \n OK there are several major points to be made here:\n \n * \"Al-Qaeda\" as such has no headquarters. It never did, unless you count Afghanistan in the very brief period of time in which the Taliban had total control (ie 1996-2001). Al-Qaeda is an ideology, not an army or an organisation. Its roots lie in opposition to partisan Western support of Israel's oppressive foreign policy, and in part in grievances from colonial times. \n If we are hit with a nuke in the future it will make no difference whether we control Baghdad or not. There are plenrty of other failed states where hatred of the West exists, and government is weak enough to allow independent terrorist ideologies to garner massive support; eg Somalia, Sudan, Afghanistan being the most obvious with small terrorist cells funded by foreign, anonymous benefactors being viable in almost any country.\n \n *Look at the London 7/7 bombers; they had all lived here for years, none of their friends or family suspected a thing, yet they did what they did and after the fact they left behind over \u00a3100,000 in bank accounts. No-one they knew had any idea that they had this much money. Where did they get it? Jason Burke, prize-winning ME journalist wrote a fascinating book published in 2003 simply called \"Al-Qaeda\". I cannot go into too much detail, but this book should be number 1 on anyone's list who genuinely wants to know the risks of terrorism today. \n \n *This book does not make comfortable reading, but it does, through interviews with ME intelligence officers, militants, mujahideen commanders and Bin Laden's associates explain how we cannot possibly even begin to win a foothold against the terrorists by invading nations. Find this book, buy it, read it. Al-Qaeda does not work how our politicians would have us believe. It is not an organisation, it has become a religion; it is a major facet of the new, radicalised Islam sweeping the globe.\n \n *To try and answer your question: If we are hit with a nuke, and we can prove that nuke came from Baghdad, we will gain NOTHING by re-invading Baghdad. The terrorists are always a minority and if we attack them with our conventional armies we will ALWAYS kill civilians, the upshot of which is that WE create hatred of ourselves amongst the ME peoples; WE create more terrorists.\n \n *My ME \"road-map\" would involve the following:\n \n 1) Withdraw ALL military support for Israel immediately.\n \n 2) Condemn the Israel/Palestine barrier, declare the region a state of emergency via the UN and send in troops to facilitate the integration of the two nations. This will take decades. (I do not believe a two-state solution is viable at this point, especially considering the separation of the West Bank and Gza.)\n \n 3) Immediately cease pressuring ME states to abandon their nuclear program and work with them and the UN to establish safe reactors which cannot supply weapons-grade materials for centuries.\n \n 4) Work with ME countries to secure the borders of Iraq and to rebuild Iraq quickly and efficiently. There are plenty of ME companies that could do these jobs, that were not even allowed to bid for the original contracts; the contracts were all given to US firms. \n \n 5) Work with ME countries to promote democracy in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan (to name just two of our \"allies\" in the War on Terror) and to promote freedom of the press by establishing more organisations similar to Al-Jazeera which is the only non-state controlled news provider in the region.\n \n *These measures and many more could be taken to gradually cement our relationship with the Arabic people. Anything else will only lead to the death of our countrymen and the stagnation of our economies.",

   "Let me say that I am very impressed with your analysis of the situation in Iraq. I have read it one time and it is late and I have to be gone most of tomorrow so I can't begin to fully reply until possibly the next day. But at least you took the time to give great thought to this situation and I commend you for it.\n \n I will leave you with this thought and you can ponder it. The state of Israel is not what caused 9/11. And the state of Israel would not now exist if not for the fact that European Jews (the ones who survived) had no home to return to after the war. And they had no easy time to form the state of Israel as you well know. Had it been up to me, I would have argued against it. And if it were up to me and I had a magic wand I would relocate the entire population of Israel to Wyoming and eastern Montana where they could have a life in peace, but that is not going to happen. That leaves the more likely possibility that at some point, assuming everything continues as it has been, that a nuclear war will erupt in the ME. This possibility (probability?) is not to be taken lightly. The power of the Hiroshima bomb was about 15 kt. The power of an \"average\" nuke is somewhere between 1 megaton to 5 megatons. An actual strategic nuclear bomb has been tested with 100 megatons of yield. We know for a virtual certainty that Israel has at a minimum of 200 nuclear bombs. We know that Iran has sworn to destroy Israel \"wipe it off the map.\" If Iran sends any kind of missile in the direction of Israel, Israel will of necessity have to assume it carries with it a nuclear warhead. At that point Israel will dump a number of those 200 nuclear bombs on their own missiles on Iran. Assuming such a nightmare scenario takes place, how much radiation do you believe will surround the world taking into account the known results of Chernobyl over a decade ago?\n \n I'll leave it here for now as I really have to hit the sack. But anyone who believes this problem is solved easily is deluding themselves. Bush may have errored greatly but history cannot be rewritten. We have to move forward. Let us hope it is in the right direction and not just a quick out of Iraq for political reasons that will yield worst results than staying put in Iraq. \n \n Later.\n \n I have to say one more thing. The idea that we have a \"shrinking economy\" is pure bunk. On this point we are diametrically opposed. Our national debt to GDP is about 65%. Japan's is 170%. We are about average; our inflation is quite low. We are at full employment. Mortgage rates are at 39 year lows. People are beating down our doors to get INTO the United States. People don't come to where a nation has a \"shrinking economy.\"",

   "\n The state of Israel is not what caused 9/11.\n\n \n This is a fairly vague statement. Assuming that either 1)Bin Laden or 2)those allied or sympathetic to him planned and/or carried out the 9/11 attacks, we know what their major grievances were:\n 1) Israeli policy in terms of settlement in, and control of, the West Bank\n 2) US military bases in Saudi Arabia\n \n \nAnd the state of Israel would not now exist if not for the fact that European Jews (the ones who survived) had no home to return to after the war. And they had no easy time to form the state of Israel as you well know.\n Irrelevant. \n \n \n[There is] the more likely possibility that at some point, assuming everything continues as it has been, that a nuclear war will erupt in the ME.\n\n \n Israel is the only country in the ME with nuclear weapons. Given this fact, there is absolutely ZERO chance that any arab nation will attack Israel. What is however likely, is that attacks against Israel will increase over the coming years for two main reasons:\n \n 1) With the seemingly inevitable fragmentation and radicalisation of Iraq, it is likely that radical Islamist groups will form non-state cross-border alliances between (for example) Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Eqypt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Working with groups such as Hizbollah and Hamas they will be able to deliver a higher quantity and quality of attacks against Israel.\n \n 2) Regardless of the current ceasefire, the historical record shows that Israel has always retaliated disproportionately against the Palestinian population in general whenever it is attacked by small groups of exremists, and prior to the ceasefire we have had two major events in recent years:\n 1: The building of the Israel/Palestine barrier which has been condemned by the UN and violates the 1967 'green line' demarcating the borders of the West Bank, and which has disenfranchised thousands of civilians, preventing them from accessing their places of employment, the fields that they own, and in some cases cutting off villages or portions of villages from the rest of the West Bank.\n 2: The politically motivated withdrawal from Gaza which left the 1.5m palestinians living in the most densely populated place on earth even more disenfranchised than they were before; the comparison is horribly distasteful but the only parallel I can think of is the Warsaw ghetto: the Israelis withdrew but made the border controls vastly more restrictive leading to mass unemployment and starvation which resulted in uprisings, resulting in the usual disproportionate Israeli retaliations condemned by Amnesty International as war crimes. \n \n \nThe power of the Hiroshima bomb was about 15 kt. The power of an \"average\" nuke is somewhere between 1 megaton to 5 megatons. An actual strategic nuclear bomb has been tested with 100 megatons of yield. We know for a virtual certainty that Israel has at a minimum of 200 nuclear bombs. We know that Iran has sworn to destroy Israel \"wipe it off the map.\" If Iran sends any kind of missile in the direction of Israel, Israel will of necessity have to assume it carries with it a nuclear warhead.\n\n \n 1) The largest nuclear bomb ever to have been tested was the Tsar Bomba, detonated by the Soviet Union in 1961 with an estimated yield of 50 megatons. This is way above the most pwerful US nuke in sevice, the B53 which weighs in at a 'puny' 1.2 megaton.\n \n 2) Israel would not assume a missile from Iran 'carries with it a nuclear warhead'. Try to imagine you are a strategic analyst. Let's say that Iran actually has developed a nuke and has managed to weaponise it (two distinct technological boundaries to cross, while Iran has not crossed even the preceeding boundary, that of devloping weapons-grade uranium/plutonium). Conversely, Iran knows that Israel definitely has the nuclear capability to utterly annihilate the entire Iranian nation.\n So, not only would a missile from Iran undoubtedly not be nuclear, it is in fact totally improbable that Iran would ever attack Israel in the first place. The whole region exists in a classic balance of terror. Israel has nukes, therefore cannot be attacked by a non-nuclear state, therefore is immune to invasion or any other state-on-state conflict. Conversely, if Israel did not have nukes it would long ago have been 'wiped off the map'.\n \n \nI have to say one more thing. The idea that we have a \"shrinking economy\" is pure bunk. On this point we are diametrically opposed. Our national debt to GDP is about 65%. Japan's is 170%. We are about average; our inflation is quite low. We are at full employment. Mortgage rates are at 39 year lows. People are beating down our doors to get INTO the United States. People don't come to where a nation has a \"shrinking economy.\"\n\n \n I have seen this argument thrashed out on these forums a hundred times, and I only have a little more than what I have read here to go on, but all the evidence and the more convincing arguments point to you being wrong. \n \n I will leave this to others more experienced in economic matters to try to explain, but the idea is (and it makes perfect sense to me, and is supported by economic heavyweights such as Joseph Steiglitz and Paul Volcker) that the US economy is one huge bubble economy, based far more on borrowing, simply printing money, and the dollar's reserve currency status than on any inherent value.\n \n I wrote a lot more on this but decide to delete it as I can say what I know to be simple economic fact concisely without getting out of my depth in speculation (help me out Daewoo!):\n \n At this point the US is only staying solvent because it can print as much money as it likes to pay the interest on its debts because everyone accepts dollars because of the dollar's reserve currency status. If the dollar loses this status, which could happen for a number of reasons, central banks around the world will begin to dump their dollar reserves en masse and the US will inevitably experience masive inflation or huge interest rate rises as the false economy crumbles and the real one rears its ugly head.\n \n ON EDIT: I appreciate that you did not have time to fully respond to my first post, I just thought I'd try to clear up some percieved misconceptions in your post about a possible nuclear scenario.",

He knows the information, he just refuses to accept it. \n \n As far as the debt figures he is using, they are GREAT, if you think for some reason that unfunded federal liabilities should not be included as \"debt\". The numbers he likes to toss around also do not include debt service on that debt. Thats right, folks, they assume that we will not be paying interest on that debt (since those interest payments are counted as \"unfunded federal liabilities\").\n \n As far as the absolutly idiotic comparison with Japan...I once went almost 5 pages expalining this to him, and I know damn well he understands it, he is just not willing to accept it becuase it blows his idiotic comparison that makes him feel better and keeps up the delusion of a healthy, strong US economy going.\n \n The yield on the JGBs (Japanese Government Bonds) is MUCH lower than the yield on US bonds. The yield on the 10 yr JGB is 1.66. The yield on the 10 yr US bond is 4.51%. The japanese sell their 10 yr bonds at a 1.66% yield, buy ours at 4.51% yield, and MAKE 2.85% by issuing debt instead of paying government operating costs out of pocket. They literally match issued bonds with US bond purchases dollar for dollar. \n \n You are 100% correct when it comes to the dollar and the strength given it by its status as a reserve currency. This has basically allowed us to print dollars without consequences because we knew that many of them woudl essentially be taken immediatly off the market and locked up in somebodies currency reserves. \n \n Now we have world bankers openly discussing dollar capitulation and multiple central banks working to unload dollar reserves. I have heard several people refer to it as \"Central Banks playing chicken with the dollar\". It is, IMO, an apt description. Every central bank on the planet that has spoken on the issue has stated they want to diversify their reserves away from the dollar. The problem is, with dollar heavy banks, diversifying means selling dollars, which results in a devaluation of their remaining dollars. So the goal is to either try to support the dollar until you can get enough of yours sold off on the sly to take the hit, or just try to slip yours out of the system (the chinese have been doing so by purchasing gold).\n \n For you brits out there...you guys have lost roughly $40 billion in reserves this year due to dollar depreciation and the fact that your governemnt has fought like crazy to keep the dollar supported. Every time the dollar fell, your central bank bought them like crazy in an attempt to avoid a massive failure. Way to go. We appreciate the assist. The extra 2 or 3 months that bought us before the dollar headed back into freefall was nice. \n \n Mule, and those like him, must secretly be in collusion with Al Queda. That is the only explanation that makes sense. They would have Americans continue with our debt ridden lifestyles and investing what little we do manage to save in our equity markets, despite repeated warnings that our stock market is overvalued by as much as 50-65%, because they want to see America fail completely. Mohommad Mule will not be happy with just a major economic correction in the US. Like his lover Osama, he wants a complete and total economic collapse, so he spreads his propoganda, trying to keep americans from preparing or attmepting to mitigate the effects of our economic decline.",

   "Not that I have access to Bin Laden's speech writer or anything, but I think he's being honest here, you're just misunderstanding him. He's simply saying that he has no intention of dressing his people up in uniform and marching them into the US in any sort of traditional stand up fight. He knows he can't do that. So instead he's using terror tactics to try to bleed us economically. If he wan'ts to take down the US, and I think that's safe to assume, then that's his best tactic. He's by no means claiming that he doesn't intend to use violence and terror, and I don't think anyone is claiming he is. His intent is to use violence to cause economic harm, because that's the only real shot he has at causing the US to collapse.\n\n \n That's the essence of Bin Laden's demands, threats and actions. Due to US government deception and consumer advertising demands supporting US media, most Americans believe the US has a strong, resilient economy. That belief creates a focus on extremist violence with normally not a public clue as to the strategy driving that violence. That ignorance enhances government ability to incur additional debt under the guise of protecting Americans (in Iraq of course) to maintain cooked GDP numbers that provide public economic reassurance.",

   "You are asking me to beat my head against a wall here, because we have been over this hundreds of times with MM. He knows the information, he just refuses to accept it. \n \n As far as the debt figures he is using, they are GREAT, if you think for some reason that unfunded federal liabilities should not be included as \"debt\". The numbers he likes to toss around also do not include debt service on that debt. Thats right, folks, they assume that we will not be paying interest on that debt (since those interest payments are counted as \"unfunded federal liabilities\").\n \n As far as the absolutly idiotic comparison with Japan...I once went almost 5 pages expalining this to him, and I know damn well he understands it, he is just not willing to accept it becuase it blows his idiotic comparison that makes him feel better and keeps up the delusion of a healthy, strong US economy going.\n \n The yield on the JGBs (Japanese Government Bonds) is MUCH lower than the yield on US bonds. The yield on the 10 yr JGB is 1.66. The yield on the 10 yr US bond is 4.51%. The japanese sell their 10 yr bonds at a 1.66% yield, buy ours at 4.51% yield, and MAKE 2.85% by issuing debt instead of paying government operating costs out of pocket. They literally match issued bonds with US bond purchases dollar for dollar. \n \n You are 100% correct when it comes to the dollar and the strength given it by its status as a reserve currency. This has basically allowed us to print dollars without consequences because we knew that many of them woudl essentially be taken immediatly off the market and locked up in somebodies currency reserves. \n \n Now we have world bankers openly discussing dollar capitulation and multiple central banks working to unload dollar reserves. I have heard several people refer to it as \"Central Banks playing chicken with the dollar\". It is, IMO, an apt description. Every central bank on the planet that has spoken on the issue has stated they want to diversify their reserves away from the dollar. The problem is, with dollar heavy banks, diversifying means selling dollars, which results in a devaluation of their remaining dollars. So the goal is to either try to support the dollar until you can get enough of yours sold off on the sly to take the hit, or just try to slip yours out of the system (the chinese have been doing so by purchasing gold).\n \n For you brits out there...you guys have lost roughly $40 billion in reserves this year due to dollar depreciation and the fact that your governemnt has fought like crazy to keep the dollar supported. Every time the dollar fell, your central bank bought them like crazy in an attempt to avoid a massive failure. Way to go. We appreciate the assist. The extra 2 or 3 months that bought us before the dollar headed back into freefall was nice. \n \n Mule, and those like him, must secretly be in collusion with Al Queda. That is the only explanation that makes sense. They would have Americans continue with our debt ridden lifestyles and investing what little we do manage to save in our equity markets, despite repeated warnings that our stock market is overvalued by as much as 50-65%, because they want to see America fail completely. Mohommad Mule will not be happy with just a major economic correction in the US. Like his lover Osama, he wants a complete and total economic collapse, so he spreads his propoganda, trying to keep americans from preparing or attmepting to mitigate the effects of our economic decline.\n\n \n You expect me to be overwhelmed by verbosity. Sorry, that won't fly. This isn't complicated at all. If our economy increases 4% a year and our core inflation is 2.3%, our economy has expanded by 1.7% and has not \"shrunk\" as has been stated. I may not have majored in mathematics, but I do know how to add 1 and 1 and know it's 2.\n \n You have argued that the cost of oil is due to \"inflation\" which as anyone with a modicum of knowledge about supply and demand knows this is patent nonsense.\n \n The fiscal deficit is merely the result of the federal government spending more than it takes in. This could be solved simply by spending less.\n \n The trade deficit is large because of two main factors. The Chinese Yuan is about 40% undervalued which increases its exports to the United States. The second factor is that Americans buy a lot of \"stuff\" and most of that \"stuff\" is imported. A trade deficit is the result of a dynamic and robust economy. A lousy economy such as exists in Germany today, has a large trade surplus. That's because the people don't have the money to spend on \"stuff.\" We do. And Japan's economy is or was in a decade long recession. Their interest rate went to 0% and was in danger of dropping into deflation which is far more dangerous than inflation. And no one has a gun to anyone or any country to export to us or to accept our dollars. They can stop anytime they want to. However, I won't be holding my breath waiting for that to happen.\n \n See. I didn't take up several pages explaining what any first semester economic students would already know.",

   "You expect me to be overwhelmed by verbosity. Sorry, that won't fly. This isn't complicated at all. If our economy increases 4% a year and our core inflation is 2.3%, our economy has expanded by 1.7% and has not \"shrunk\" as has been stated. I may not have majored in mathematics, but I do know how to add 1 and 1 and know it's 2.\n\n \n This is what I mean about beating my head against the wall. We have had the discussion regarding inflation at least a dozen times. You have been provided with links and explanation, including from government sources for the fact that our inflation is understated by at least 80%. There is absolutly no debate about this and it is indisputable, and that has been conclusively proven to you on several occasions. You, though, are not honest enough to include that fact in your ignorant rant.\n \n You also need to factor in how much of that \"growth\" is purely the result of non value added, debt based, government spending. \n \n Your problem is that you are too ignorant to realise that trying to simplify the economy to a \"1+1\" equation is dumb.\n \n \nYou have argued that the cost of oil is due to \"inflation\" which as anyone with a modicum of knowledge about supply and demand knows this is patent nonsense.\n\n \n And yet after hundreds of posts on multiple forums...thousands of views...you have never had anybody agree with you on this. This is because anybody with the intelligence that god gave a little green apple can look at the overwhelming evidence and see that the lions share of oil price increases in the past decade have been the result of inflation. Mule, you unquestionably lost this argument when OPEC came out and announced that they were raising their price target due to DOLLAR DEVALUATION. \n \n \nThe fiscal deficit is merely the result of the federal government spending more than it takes in. This could be solved simply by spending less.\n\n \n Actually, no, it couldn't at this point. We have reached the point where we are forced to issue debt just to cover service costs on our existing debt. We are floatng our credit cards. Even if the federal government cut yearly expenditures by 60%, we would still run a deficit. The other massive whole in this theory is that at this point, those debt driven government spending and associated flow through is such a large portion of our economy now that if they stop, our economy crashes. Use anybodys numbers. Evne with your cooked inflation and GDP numbers, without JUST Iraq war expenditures and associated flow through, we would literally be in a depression this year. Not debatale...simple math.\n \n \nThe trade deficit is large because of two main factors. The Chinese Yuan is about 40% undervalued which increases its exports to the United States. The second factor is that Americans buy a lot of \"stuff\" and most of that \"stuff\" is imported. A trade deficit is the result of a dynamic and robust economy. A lousy economy such as exists in Germany today, has a large trade surplus. That's because the people don't have the money to spend on \"stuff.\" We do. And Japan's economy is or was in a decade long recession. Their interest rate went to 0% and was in danger of dropping into deflation which is far more dangerous than inflation. And no one has a gun to anyone or any country to export to us or to accept our dollars. They can stop anytime they want to. However, I won't be holding my breath waiting for that to happen.\n\n \n This is one of the stupidest things I have ever seen you put out there for comment. So, back in the good ol days, when the personal savings rate in the US was 20%, we were literally producing more industrial output than the rest of the world combined, we were the worlds largest creditor nation, and personal income was rising in the double digits nearly every year with FLAT inflation, our economy was sick....but now, when we have a negative savings rate, more debt than the rest of the world combined, tens of billions of dollars and tens of thousands fo good manufacturing jobs are fleeing the country every month, the economy is in great shape. \n \n Your thought process here boggles the mind and makes a good case for forced sterilization.\n \n \nSee. I didn't take up several pages explaining what any first semester economic students would already know.\n\n \n How would you know what a first semester economics student woudl no?

   "That's even funnier. Using debt to achieve a 'robust' economy.\n\n \n Our fiscal debt as a part of the overall GDP is quite low. Certainly lower than in Europe. Our national debt is about 65% which is about in the middle of most similar western nations. You should look it up during WWII when it was well over 100% of national GDP and we had a booming economy. \n \n I've never argued that \"debt\" was a good thing. What I have argued is that it must put in the proper context. When that is done, it is essentially a non-issue.\n \n \"The US has the largest and most technologically powerful economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $42,000. In this market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms make most of the decisions, and the federal and state governments buy needed goods and services predominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms enjoy greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, to lay off surplus workers, and to develop new products. At the same time, they face higher barriers to enter their rivals' home markets than foreign firms face entering US markets. US firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances, especially in computers and in medical, aerospace, and military equipment; their advantage has narrowed since the end of World War II. The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual development of a \"two-tier labor market\" in which those at the bottom lack the education and the professional/technical skills of those at the top and, more and more, fail to get comparable pay raises, health insurance coverage, and other benefits. Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20% of households. The response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 showed the remarkable resilience of the economy. The war in March-April 2003 between a US-led coalition and Iraq, and the subsequent occupation of Iraq, required major shifts in national resources to the military. The rise in GDP in 2004 and 2005 was undergirded by substantial gains in labor productivity. Hurricane Katrina caused extensive damage in the Gulf Coast region in August 2005, but had a small impact on overall GDP growth for the year. Soaring oil prices in 2005 and 2006 threatened inflation and unemployment, yet the economy continued to grow through mid-2006. Imported oil accounts for about two-thirds of US consumption. Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, sizable trade and budget deficits, and stagnation of family income in the lower economic groups.\"\n \n \n GDP (purchasing power parity): \n $12.31 trillion (2005 est.) \n \n GDP (official exchange rate): \n $12.49 trillion (2005 est.) \n \n GDP - real growth rate: \n 3.2% (2005 est.) \n \n GDP - per capita (PPP): \n $41,600 (2005 est.) \n \n Public debt: \n 64.7% of GDP (2005 est.)\n \n \n https://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html#Econ\n \n Economy - overview:\n \n Germany's affluent and technologically powerful economy - the fifth largest in the world - has become one of the slowest growing economies in the euro zone. A quick turnaround is not in the offing in the foreseeable future. Growth in 2001-03 fell short of 1%, rising to 1.7% in 2004 before falling back to 0.9% in 2005. The modernization and integration of the eastern German economy continues to be a costly long-term process, with annual transfers from west to east amounting to roughly $70 billion. Germany's aging population, combined with high unemployment, has pushed social security outlays to a level exceeding contributions from workers. Structural rigidities in the labor market - including strict regulations on laying off workers and the setting of wages on a national basis - have made unemployment a chronic problem. Corporate restructuring and growing capital markets are setting the foundations that could allow Germany to meet the long-term challenges of European economic integration and globalization, particularly if labor market rigidities are further addressed.

   "This debt based government boogie man you have concocted is totally absurd. All that one has to do is to look up at our spending during WWII when our economy was on fire. Our biggest deficit spending occured during the war when fully 90% of the budget was for the military. We are spending a pittance today and the sky is falling. Look out below!\n\n \n This is what you seem to be missing. During WWII, we saw a temporary boom brought abotu by massive government spending. The beauty of this was that the lions share fo that government spending was going to increase of our industial infrastructure for wartime goods. Our national production capability was increasing by 70% annually. Following the war, we retooled those factories and essentially ended up with massively improved produciton capability....which worked out well because we basically had the worlds only INTACT industrial infrastructure. The years after WWII allowed us to build our national wealth at an astonishing rate. We were the only game in town.\n \n Now, by your standards, since we were running a massive trade surplus (bringing money into the country), that was actually a sick economy. \n \n \nYou'll be saying the same things when oil is priced below $30 a barrel. I've already proven you are wrong simply because the highest oil prices were in 1981 adjusted for inflation. The price of oil today is not due to inflation or we would be paying a much higher price. I don't give a damn what OPEC says about the price of oil. They say a lot of things. If they were subject to our laws they would all be serving long sentences at Leavenworth for price fixing. They can say anything they want to. And BTW, the DOW was up another 90 points today.\n\n \n I can't remember if it was 5 or 6 people who tried to explain to you last time you made that worthless, moronic comparison that comparing oil to the spike in the early 80's is flawed. You are comparing an abnormal market with a normal one, and claiming that prices are low. \n \n Granted if I was trying to argue your idiotic position I would be forced to resot to dishonesty as well since it is simply so far out of the realm of intelligent thought that there is simply no way to debate it using anythign approaching fact or logic.\n \n Whether you like opec or not, as I have shown dozens of times, they set their target price and have generally been effective at defending that price. \n \n OPEC nations take payments in dollars and are then forced to convert those dollars to Euros to purchase their goods. At one time, they just purchased those good from the US and it worked out OK for them. Now, with the US no longer producing many goods, and what we DO produce largely being considered overpriced junk by the rest of the world, OPEC nations are forced to buy their goods elsewhere.\n \n They have two choices...stop accepting dollars for payment, which would crash the dollar and relegate the US to third world nation status overnight, or charge more dollars to make up for the difference.",

   "That 25% has actually very little valued added to it during the time it is in China. Final assembly of components manufactured in Taiwan, SK or Japan. That is where the bulk of the value added is created. For China ( taking a guess), the $200-300 billion dollars of goods exported to the US from China will account for only 10% or so of China's GDP ( as the value added in China is the final assembly and shipping, not the entire value of the export )\n\n \n The numbers I have seen suggest closer to 8% of total GDP. This was an issue lately with the threats of tarriffs on chinese goods. Basically what it ends up boiling down to is that Taiwan, SK, and Japan woudl have been crippled by those tarriffs, and china MIGHT have had a mild recession. They were basically set (government plan in place...including contracts) to switch the industrial capacity they are using for the production of US bound good to production of goods for the asian, european, russian, and african markets. Wit the threat of sanctions, the chinese government literally went through on a factory by factory basis and found alternative uses for the facilities should it be required.

Would you say that China's economy is sick?\n \n Growth based on debt is not really growth at all, unless the growth is large enough to pay off the debt and the interest.\n \n Let me use an analogy. If I were to borrow a million dollars (plus interest), then technically speaking I would be a millionaire and on top of the world. But unless I use the money I borrowed to make more money so I can pay off the debt and the interest, I would be in deep financial doo-doo.\n\n \n No, I don't believe that. But I do believe their banking system is broke. \n \n You need to differentiate between the fiscal debt and trade deficit. They are not the same. On the fiscal side, we are just fine. The trade deficit is naturally self correcting. As to the national debt there is no need to pay it off. All that needs to be done is to service the debt just as we pay for our homes and automobiles. If our incomes are adequate we have no difficulty. Nor will the government if it is run properly. We are NOT a third world country that just prints fiat money. \n \n Stop being so pessimistic. As one grows wealthier they are better able to handle debt. It is just a matter of percentages and simple arithmetic. You can look up our national debt dating back decades and see this clearly. We're in great shape and all that we need to do is to cut back on spending which is not necessary such as \"the bridge to nowwhere\" which was one of the most egregious example of pork barrel spending (now known as \"earmarks.) That's purely a political problem; not an economic problem.",

E = MC2. \n \n Bearing in mind that the Manhatten Project produced the atomic bomb that ended WWII, why are we now so incapable of solving the energy problem? NO ONE on the planet has any idea of how much oil reserves exist in ANWR because it hasn't been explored. You can say a few million barrels. I can say 200 billion barrels. One opinion is just as good as the other. When I said that they were shooting gas wells in the backyards of Fort Worth I was being entirely factual. It was even covered on ABC news the other night. Just about anywhere will do. I see them all the time where I live. God only knows how much is out in the Gulf. Colorado has plenty of oil shale to exploit. Wyoming has 600 years of coal. Alberta has the tar sands that are said to be far larger than Saudi Arabia and are much less likely to be targeted by terrorists. And it's next door. The batteries in your electrical appliances, etc. I have a hybrid vehicle. This is technology right now. There is an unlimited amount of solar power and an unlimited amount of hydrogen in the ocean. And we can do so much more with nuclear. The ethanol business is all political. It is largely bulloney and a net minus by the politicians make hay of it. Diesels can be run on virtually anything. Conservation is only now beginning to make a dent. Air up our tires and save a million gallons a day. We got by on three gallons of gasoline a week during WWII. I'm tired of us hearing that we are on the path of ruinination. It us patent nonsense. These doomsters and gloomsters have been around forever and they are always wrong. But they continue to come out of the woodwork and under their rocks because there is like the sun an inexhaustible number of gullible fools. All we have to do is to get up on our two hind legs and get to work. It's the American way. And stop feeling sorry for ourselves. For Pete's sake.",

   "China: The Big Bank\n Global players are paying billions for stakes in a chaotic Chinese banking system. Are they getting a deal, or fool's gold?\n \n By George Wehrfritz\n \n Newsweek International\n \n July 18 issue - Hardly a week goes by without news of a banking deal in China with lots of zeroes attached. On July 5 Singapore's official investment arm, Temasek, made headlines by confirming that it would invest $1 billion in the China Construction Bank when the latter lists in Hong Kong later this year. Two weeks earlier, Bank of America had agreed to pay $3 billion for a 9.1 percent stake in China Construction with the option to buy more down the road. Sandwiched between those two announcements, the Shanghai-based Bank of Communications raised $1.9 billion in a watershed initial public offering in Hong Kong. By the opening day's close, its share price had shot up 13 percent....\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8525725/site/newsweek/\n \n And this:\n \n \"Here's what I learned in Tokyo: If you're the leader of Japan, America, Australia, Taiwan, Malaysia, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines or the European Union and you're not going to bed each night saying the following prayer for China, then you're not paying attention:\n \n \"Dear Heavenly Father, please keep the leader of China, President Hu Jintao, healthy and on an even keel. Please see to it that he moves steadily and carefully toward restructuring the Chinese banking system and ridding it of its huge overhang of bad loans and corruption, before there is a real meltdown that would be felt around the world. Give him the wisdom to cool the overheated Chinese economy without creating a recession that would prompt China to stop importing like crazy and start just exporting like crazy. And Father, forgive us for all the bad words we used in recent years to describe China's leaders - terms like `Butchers of Beijing.' We did not mean it. We meant to say `Bankers of Beijing,' because their economy is now fueling growth all over Asia, bolstering Japan and sucking up imports from everywhere. May China's leaders live to 120, and may they enjoy 9 percent G.D.P. growth every year of their lives. Thank you, Father. Amen.\"\n \n ....If the China bubble bursts, it will be the mother of all burst bubbles. Which is why we need to pray that China's leaders will have the skill to cool things down, just enough but not too much, without some wheels falling off\"...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.pekingduck.org/archives/001207.php",

E = MC2.\n\n \n I've got a MSc. in geology and 10 yrs in the oil business backing up my statements, you have an unsupported opinion.\n \n It's my job to know the stats and facts behind the numbers you throw around on a whim.\n \n If you want to start a thread in which we can ponder E=MC2, go right ahead, as for now, it's you on the hot seat, and you have real pertinent questions that you've chosen to ignore. Perhaps you should stick to watching TV, and nothing beyond sitcoms.\n \n \nBearing in mind that the Manhatten Project produced the atomic bomb that ended WWII, why are we now so incapable of solving the energy problem? \n \n \n What a ridiculous comparison. The Manhattan project was quite a feat, but compared to solving the the world's energy problems, it's like finally mastering simple addition in a quantum physics class.\n \n \nNO ONE on the planet has any idea of how much oil reserves exist in ANWR because it hasn't been explored. You can say a few million barrels. I can say 200 billion barrels. One opinion is just as good as the other. \n \n \n This is total B.S. Do you even really believe your own B.S. here?\n \n Do you have any knowledge of ANWR whatsoever? Do you have any knowledge of the neighboring Mackenzie delta and North Slope oil pools?\n \n I'm not a work right now and don't have the links and data handy. I'll post the info for you on Monday. You can peruse what your own gov't and industry experts have stated on the reserves in ANWR by simply going to the link I provided you, www.usgs.com and navigating from there.\n \n Maybe you can arrange a meeting with the CEO's Chevron-Texaco, Conoco-Phillips, BP, etc... and convince them that they're fools, their numbers are all wrong, you're right, and they should drill the hell out of ANWR. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nWhen I said that they were shooting gas wells in the backyards of Fort Worth I was being entirely factual. It was even covered on ABC news the other night. Just about anywhere will do. I see them all the time where I live.\n\n \n I don't doubt they are drilling them. I do doubt they'll have the type of impact on NA oil reserves that you're claiming. Drilling lots of wells and drilling GOOD wells are two very different things.\n \n \nGod only knows how much is out in the Gulf.\n \n \n No need for God, just check the USGS or other published reserve reports.\n \n \nColorado has plenty of oil shale to exploit. Wyoming has 600 years of coal.\n \n \n You've stated this before, but have done nothing to back it up when asked, so I'll assume you've simply got no support.\n \n \nAlberta has the tar sands that are said to be far larger than Saudi Arabia and are much less likely to be targeted by terrorists. And it's next door.\n \n \n The oil sands are impressive, I've been there and done that. They'll be an enormous source of wealth for Alberta and Canada, but they sure aren't going to solve the world's energy problems.\n \n \nThe batteries in your electrical appliances, etc. I have a hybrid vehicle. This is technology right now. There is an unlimited amount of solar power and an unlimited amount of hydrogen in the ocean. And we can do so much more with nuclear. The ethanol business is all political. It is largely bulloney and a net minus by the politicians make hay of it. Diesels can be run on virtually anything. Conservation is only now beginning to make a dent. Air up our tires and save a million gallons a day. We got by on three gallons of gasoline a week during WWII. I'm tired of us hearing that we are on the path of ruinination. It us patent nonsense. These doomsters and gloomsters have been around forever and they are always wrong. But they continue to come out of the woodwork and under their rocks because there is like the sun an inexhaustible number of gullible fools. All we have to do is to get up on our two hind legs and get to work. It's the American way. And stop feeling sorry for ourselves.

I find that absurd on its face. All it really establishes is prima facia stupidity.\n \n Here is some readily information about the tar sands in Alberta. No one doubts these numbers any more.\n \n Estimated oil reserves\n \n The Alberta Government calculates that about 28 billion cubic metres (174 billion barrels) of crude bitumen are economically recoverable from the three Alberta oil sands areas at current prices using current technology. This is equivalent to about 10% of the estimated 1,700 and 2,500 billion barrels of bitumen in place. [1]. Alberta estimates that the Athabasca deposits alone contain 5.6 billion cubic metres (35 billion barrels) of surface mineable bitumen and 15.6 billion cubic metres (98 billion barrels) of bitumen recoverable by in-situ methods. These estimates of Canada's oil reserves caused some astonishment when they were first published but are now largely accepted by the international community. This volume places Canadian proven oil reserves second in the world behind those of Saudi Arabia...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athabasca_Tar_Sands#Estimated_oil_reserves\n \n And this:\n \n The Trillion-Barrel Tar Pit \n Who needs \"oil independence\" - our friendly neighbor to the north is sitting on a black gold mine!\n By Brendan I. KoernerPage 1 of 3 next >>\n \n \n Feature: \n The Trillion-Barrel Tar Pit \n Plus: \n Tapping the Oil Sands of Alberta\n \n Fort McMurray, Alberta, is an unlikely destination for a congressional boondoggle, especially when cold snaps of 40 below make it dangerous to leave any patch of skin uncovered. But here I am in midwinter, 250 miles north of Edmonton, watching a flock of Washington politicians in subzero parkas cling to tour guides like a trail of oversize ducklings. With gas prices approaching $3 a gallon in some states, the US representatives are braving the frigid air not for adventure but to learn about a filthy sort of alchemy, one that turns sludgy, sticky earth into sweet crude oil. \n \n Alberta sits atop the biggest petroleum deposit outside the Arabian peninsula - as many as 300 billion recoverable barrels and another trillion-plus barrels that could one day be within reach using new retrieval methods. (By contrast, the entire Middle East holds an estimated 685 billion barrels that are recoverable.)...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/oil.html",

Ask a question and I'll answer it as best I can.\n \n I'm originally from Saskatchewan, where the bulk of the oil production is from the Williston Basin, much of it sourced from the Mississippian Bakken Formation that is the topic of the paper you linked to, so I'm quite familiar with it.\n \n The most basic thing you need to understand is that while the Bakken may indeed have generated those enourmous volumes of hydrocarbons, (and that is debatable in and of itself), that does NOT mean that they are lying in the ground waiting to be produced. An oil pool requires 3 key ingredients - source of oil (the Bakken is world class), a reservoir, and a seal or trap. The problem with Bakken sources oils is that the reservoir, and more importantly, the seal/trap is largely absent. The oil migrated to surface or was broken down. It has been postulated that the Bakken is one of the sources of the oil in the tar sands and heavy oil belt of NW Sask, NE Alberta, but organic petrological and geochemical data is not conclusive.\n \n I know your goal here is to test my \"expertise\" but seeing as have you have zero expertise, how will know one way or another?\n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. I know what I know by going to school for 7 years, and spending the rest of my time actively exploring for oil.

Waxy is not as concerned about this, but then, he lives in canda where the entire agricultural industry is not wholly dependant on cheap oil. In the Us, even if you discount the energy problems that are likely to come with an oil peak, just the loss of cheap hydrocarbons for things like fertilizer, pesticides, herbicides, packaging, etc... will likely result in starvation in a peak oil scenario.\n\n \n I guess those long coal trains I used to see coming out of Wyoming were fictions of my imagination. And those big piles of coal at the local power plant where I lived; well that didn't exist either. \n \n The second coming of Christ will occur before we EVER run out of coal.",

And those big piles of coal at the local power plant where I lived; well that didn't exist either. \n \n The second coming of Christ will occur before we EVER run out of coal.\n\n \n Like I said...we fire some power plants with coal and use it in a few (very few) inductrial processes. \n \n The fact that there is a big pile of coal at your local power plant isn't especially surprising. It is probably a coal fired plant. The long coal trains are going to those power plants to provide them with coal to burn. Coal provides about 25% of our total current energy.\n \n If we replace 40% of the oil we use with coal, our current usage would increase byu 700%. Do the math on that one. You have either accepted the fact that switching to coal from oil is impractical, or you expect christ to return fairly soon.\n \n Is there any topic that youa re knowledgable about, or is your entire life just one uninformed rant after another?",

   "I believe with about 99% certainty that there will come a day that my children look at me with an awe struck look on their faces and say \"You guys BURNED oil?\"\n \n You say \"oil\" and people think \"gas\". In the real world, slightly less than half of our oil ends up as fuel. The rest is used to make....everything. You suggest oil shortages and people start thinking of ways to produce electricy. We don't use oil to produce electricity now, nor is there a shortage of electricity in most places. electricity makes for a poor transportation fuel and no mater how much you generate, it will not replace the oil used in making platics, fertilizers, medicines, etc...\n\n \n I'm far from an expert when it comes to this type of pontificating, but here's my opinion.\n \n CHEAP oil will end. As a result, we won't be able to simply burn it. The other products that come from oil - plastics, chemicals, even textiles will continue to be available, as they will be the most valuable to society, but they will come at a cost. There MUST be an alternative source of energy. During the transition, transportation will become the domain of the rich. Airline travel for a vacation will be reserved purely for the Bill Gate's of the world, and the thought of loading up a V10 truck and towing a trailer with 4 gas guzzling snowmobiles four hours to the mountains to burn gas all day and return will seem like science fiction. \n \n IMHO, the world in which each individual lives will get much smaller. I think we'll see a pretty major hit in the amount of leisure time and leisure spending that we currently enjoy. Food prices will rise dramatically (food is WAY undervalued in our world), and the basics in life won't be as cheap and easy to attain.\n \n The whole thing hinges not only on conserving what we have, but finding a truly viable alternative - and I for one have not heard of that alternative as yet.
