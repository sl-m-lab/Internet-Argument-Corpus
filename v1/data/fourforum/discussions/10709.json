Some nich businesses that cater to custermer desires are also not the best.\n And that's even respecting the businesses (and peoples) right to seek profit and success. \n Must be the economy bringing me down. I hate covering the business news at work and I'd love to sell the house, but not in this market...\n \n And while I see a gov't as needed at times to ensure people are protected from predatory practices and harm as well as ensuring the free flow of traffic, goods and services to it's people, I think most people should be left alone to their own pursuits.\n \n *shrug*\n \n I see some of the posters here are communo-anarchists intent on tearing the 'stablishment down with their bare paws.\n Roar!",
