According to their forecasts, extreme changes in climate could produce a future in which erratic and chaotic weather, melting ice caps and rising sea levels usher in an era of drought, crop failure, famine, flood and mass extinctions.\"\n \n On June 13, USA Today declared, \"The debate's over: Globe is Warming.\" In support of its claim, the newspaper cited the positions of some left-leaning religious groups, some corporations who will reap a financial windfall from a switch to alternative fuel sources, and some politicians.\n \n \n Scientists Disagree\n \n While each of the above claims from non-scientists received significant media coverage, leading climatologists spent the month of June rebutting such proclamations.\n \n Atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer, professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and former director of the U.S. Weather Satellite Service, sent a letter to the editor of USA Today directly refuting its claim. \"Your editorial ... claim[s] the global warming debate is over. Not so,\" wrote Singer.\n \n Singer wrote, \"Sea level will continue to rise by only seven inches per century as it has for thousands of years no matter what we do or what the EPA [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] says. And temperatures in the next 100 years will likely rise by less than one degree F--not exactly a catastrophe.\"\n \n Added Singer in a subsequent letter to the Canadian media, \"Thousands of scientists from many countries now fully understand that Kyoto and other efforts to control human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are ineffective and entirely unfounded scientifically.\n \n \"Even if you ignore the enormous cost of Kyoto (estimated recently by Prof. George Taylor of Oregon State University--see http://www.sitewave.net/news/s49p628.htm--at one trillion U.S. dollars a year for full implementation in OECD countries), climate science research is rapidly moving AWAY from the hypothesis that the human release of greenhouse gases, specifically CO2, is in any way significantly contributing to global climate change.\"\n \n \n Sun Called Primary Cause\n \n \"If we just look at the historical data, there is a scientific consensus that the global mean temperature has risen modestly during the twentieth century,\" said Myron Ebell, director of global warming and environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. \"The impacts have been small and probably beneficial in aggregate.

This latest defector from the global warming camp caps a year in which numerous scientific studies have bolstered the claims of climate skeptics. Scientific studies that debunk the dire predictions of human-caused global warming have continued to accumulate and many believe the new science is shattering the media-promoted scientific \"consensus\" on climate alarmism.\n \n Claude Allegre, a former government official and an active member of France's Socialist Party, wrote an editorial on September 21, 2006 in the French newspaper L'Express titled \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\" (For English Translation, click here: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works ) detailing his newfound skepticism about manmade global warming. See: http://www.lexpress.fr/idees/tribunes/dossier/allegre/dossier.asp?ida=451670 Allegre wrote that the \"cause of climate change remains unknown\" and pointed out that Kilimanjaro is not losing snow due to global warming, but to local land use and precipitation changes. Allegre also pointed out that studies show that Antarctic snowfall rate has been stable over the past 30 years and the continent is actually gaining ice.\n \n \"Following the month of August experienced by the northern half of France, the prophets of doom of global warming will have a lot on their plate in order to make our fellow countrymen swallow their certitudes,\" Allegre wrote. He also accused proponents of manmade catastrophic global warming of being motivated by money, noting that \"the ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people!\"\n \n Allegre, a member of both the French and U.S. Academy of Sciences, had previously expressed concern about manmade global warming. \"By burning fossil fuels, man enhanced the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century,\" Allegre wrote 20 years ago. In addition, Allegre was one of 1500 scientists who signed a November 18, 1992 letter titled \"World Scientists' Warning to Humanity\" in which the scientists warned that global warming's \"potential risks are very great.\" See: Warning to Humanity\n \n Allegre has authored more than 100 scientific articles, written 11 books and received numerous scientific awards including the Goldschmidt Medal from the Geochemical Society of the United States.\n \n Allegre's conversion to a climate skeptic comes at a time when global warming alarmists have insisted that there is a \"consensus\" about manmade global warming. Proponents of global warming have ratcheted up the level of rhetoric on climate skeptics recently. An environmental magazine in September called for Nuremberg-style trials for global warming skeptics and CBS News \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Scott Pelley compared skeptics to \"Holocaust deniers.\" See: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works & Scott Pelley And Catherine Herrick On Global Warming Coverage - Public Eye In addition, former Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly referred to skeptics as \"global warming deniers.\"\n \n This increase in rhetorical flourish comes at a time when new climate science research continues to unravel the global warming alarmists' computer model predictions of future climatic doom and vindicate skeptics.\n \n 60 Scientists Debunk Global Warming Fears\n \n Earlier this year, a group of prominent scientists came forward to question the so-called \"consensus\" that the Earth faces a \"climate emergency.\" On April 6, 2006, 60 scientists wrote a letter to the Canadian Prime Minister asserting that the science is deteriorating from underneath global warming alarmists.\n \n \"Observational evidence does not support today's computer climate models, so there is little reason to trust model predictions of the future...Significant [scientific] advances have been made since the [Kyoto] protocol was created, many of which are taking us away from a concern about increasing greenhouse gases. If, back in the mid-1990s, we knew what we know today about climate, Kyoto would almost certainly not exist, because we would have concluded it was not necessary,\" the 60 scientists wrote. See: Open Kyoto to debate\n \n \"It was only 30 years ago that many of today's global-warming alarmists were telling us that the world was in the midst of a global-cooling catastrophe.

I doubt there is much scripture on GW, the Flood notwithstanding.\n\n \n You are so gullible and naive as to rely on a bought and paid for government mouth piece since you like its anagram and it sounds official. But the IPCC is promoting an agenda, not science. And you obviously aren't smart enough to tell the difference. Here's an excerpt from the link. \n Offering a serious counter balance to the IPCC-UNnonsenseand itsnefarious black-ops at IPCC the reader should consider the links to the right on this page especially the peer review articles rapidly compiling atthe Science & Public Policy Institute (SPPI). Especially take note of Professor Bob Carter's series of five videos which offer an excellent introduction to the areas of controversy. These five videos are posted on the SPPI site here.\n \n Atmospheric Climate Reporters bent on selling front page stories with hysteria driven headlines have been frustrated as they run into a wall of resolute, determined climate skeptics that want to learn the supportable truth on climate issues regardless of where it leads. The Reporters sense a change in climate politics as skeptics focus on peer reviewing the deluge of papers written by the IPCC cabal of diverse international governmental and grant supported agencies. Over $1-billion per year grants and subsidies support nearly any PhD research project as long as it contains man-caused global warming conclusions.\n \n Skeptics' dissent is filtered out of climate conclaves as well by black listing all identified skeptics from communications. No nonbelievers allowed. \n \n In response to all this nonsense, the skeptics have disciplined their peer reviews to be written in plain English understandable without advanced degrees, and are poking holes in all the IPCC climate-alarmist science status reports. \n \n The tide is changing. As a result of resolute skeptics, some Climate Reporters are beginning to hedge their article headlines from \"Global Warming Disaster is Imminent & Man is the Cause\" over to a simple \"Climate Change\" headlines. The term \"Climate Change\" finds no disagreement among scientists and of course avoids the presumptive political and sociologic implications of man-caused climate change so rabidly foisted upon the ignorant public by climate alarmists and their fellow-traveler worshipers.\n \n This shift in headliner catch phrasing by climate reporters is an obvious hedge against a persistent scientific climate truth that is not cooperating with the \"man-caused\" mantra. Induced climate hysteria apparently isn't selling too well as it runs into a wall of skeptics doing their homework and reporting to the public, all without government funding. What ever happened to the great sound-bites the alarmists fired from the hip? \"The skeptics are all oil industry stooges bought and paid for by big oil.\"\n \n The climate reporters' purposeful shift is that years (or months) from now, when climate science is no longer front page, their relabeling will conceal their past editorials pushing mass climate hysteria and repainttheir Paparazzi-like reporting as though climatereporters represented the thread of unyieldingscientific truth all along and were, afterall, operating with high ethical standards.GlobalWarmingIndex - Global Warming Index, #Directory and Science Forum#by P&CR.Org - A#Skeptic's Corner #",

   "The SSPI is a Republican organisation part funded by Exxon Mobil.\n \n Bob Carter meanwhile is a paleontologist with no published work in the field of climatology.\n\n \n I realize that all you can do is attack the source rather than the content of their evidence, but that doesn't change the facts of their evidence in any way. I challenge you to disprove their evidence which exposes the faulty math which IPCCs results are derived from.\n \n Proved: There is No Climate Crisis \n Written by Robert Ferguson \n Tuesday, 15 July 2008\n WASHINGTON (7-15-08) - Mathematical proof that there is no \"climate crisis\" appears today in a major, peer-reviewed paper in Physics and Society, a learned journal of the 4,600-strong American Physical Society, SPPI reports. \n Christopher Monckton, who once advised Margaret Thatcher, demonstrates via 30 equations that computer models used by the UN's climate panel (IPCC) were pre-programmed with overstated values for the three variables whose product is \"climate sensitivity\" (temperature increase in response to greenhouse-gas increase), resulting in a 500-2000% overstatement of CO2's effect on temperature in the IPCC's latest climate assessment report, published in 2007. \n \n Climate Sensitivity Reconsidered [http://www.aps.org/units/fps/newsletters/200807/index.cfm] demonstrates that later this century a doubling of the concentration of CO2 compared with pre-industrial levels will increase global mean surface temperature not by the 6 \u00b0F predicted by the IPCC but, harmlessly, by little more than 1 \u00b0F. Lord Monckton concludes -\"... Perhaps real-world climate sensitivity is very much below the IPCC's estimates. Perhaps, therefore, there is no 'climate crisis' at all. ... The correct policy approach to a non-problem is to have the courage to do nothing.\"Larry Gould, Professor of Physics at the University of Hartford and Chair (2004) of the New England Section of the American Physical Society (APS), has been studying climate-change science for four years. He said: \n \"I was impressed by an hour-long academic lecture which criticized claims about 'global warming' and explained the implications of the physics of radiative transfer for climate change. I was pleased that the audience responded to the informative presentation with a prolonged, standing ovation. That is what happened when, at the invitation of the President of our University, Christopher Monckton lectured here in Hartford this spring. I am delighted that Physics and Society, an APS journal, has published his detailed paper refining and reporting his important and revealing results.'\n \"To me the value of this paper lies in its dispassionate but ruthlessly clear exposition - or, rather, expos\u00e9 - of the IPCC's method of evaluating climate sensitivity. The detailed arguments in this paper, and, indeed, in a large number of other scientific papers, point up extensive errors, including numerous projection errors of climate models, as well as misleading statements by the IPCC. Consequently, there are no rational grounds for believing either the IPCC or any other claims of dangerous anthropogenic 'global warming'.\"\n Lord Monckton's paper reveals that -\n The IPCC's 2007 climate summary overstated CO2's impact on temperature by 500-2000%;\n CO2 enrichment will add little more than 1 \u00b0F (0.6 \u00b0C) to global mean surface temperature by 2100;\n Not one of the three key variables whose product is climate sensitivity can be measured directly;\n The IPCC's values for these key variables are taken from only four published papers, not 2,500;\n The IPCC's values for each of the three variables, and hence for climate sensitivity, are overstated;\n \"Global warming\" halted ten years ago, and surface temperature has been falling for seven years;\n Not one of the computer models relied upon by the IPCC predicted so long and rapid a cooling;\n The IPCC inserted a table into the scientists' draft, overstating the effect of ice-melt by 1000%;\n It was proved 50 years ago that predicting climate more than two weeks ahead is impossible;\n Mars, Jupiter, Neptune's largest moon, and Pluto warmed at the same time as Earth warmed;\n In the past 70 years the Sun was more active than at almost any other time in the past 11,400 years.\n Global Warming Science and Public Policy - Proved: There is No Climate Crisis",

   "Hi Art, welcome to the forum. It's interesting that you consider Monckton's math funny, since that is exactly the point he is making about IPCC's math. He say's this: Christopher Monckton, who once advised Margaret Thatcher, demonstrates via 30 equations that computer models used by the UN&#8217;s climate panel (IPCC) were pre-programmed with overstated values for the three variables whose product is &#8220;climate sensitivity&#8221; (temperature increase in response to greenhouse-gas increase), resulting in a 500-2000% overstatement of CO2&#8217;s effect on temperature in the IPCC&#8217;s latest climate assessment report, published in 2007.\n\n \n Difference is, the Monckton article actually does contain serious errors, which i'll detail later tonight when I have time. The IPCC AR4 does not.\n \n This probably ought to be expected, seeing as how the man is a journalist, not a scientist.\n \n \nAnd my link doesn't say it was published in a peer reviewed outlet at all. It clearly say's that the \"major peer reviewed paper\" was published in \"Physics and Society;\" Here's the quote: Mathematical proof that there is no &#8220;climate crisis&#8221; appears today in a major, peer-reviewed paper in Physics and Society, a learned journal of the 4,600-strong American Physical Society, SPPI reports.  So it isn't saying the journal is a peer reviewed journal, only that the paper in it is. I just state this for the sake of accuracy.\n\n \n But that's still not accurate. Preceeding the paper:\n \n \nThe following article has not undergone any scientific peer review, since that is not normal procedure for American Physical Society newsletters. The American Physical Society reaffirms the following position on climate change, adopted by its governing body, the APS Council, on November 18, 2007: \"Emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere in ways that affect the Earth's climate.\"\n\n \n The paper was not peer-reviewed. Why? Because FPS does not peer-review. \n \n Have you actually read the paper?\n \n \nAgain, there is evidence which belies their claims regarding the Suns impact on climate in recent decades. Here are some fallacies about Global Warming [snip]\n\n \n Instead of this scattershot of links tactic you seem to be fond of, hows about addressing my criticism? It is true that there has been no trend in TSI for as long as we've had direct measurements, right? And it is also true that there has been, in the same period, an upward trend in global mean temperature, right? So how can the sun explain the warming trend?\n \n Please be specific and cite scholarly sources.",

   "One quick observation about Monckton's math. He writes:\n \n \nSince the great majority of the incoming solar radiation incident upon the Earth strikes the tropics, any reduction in tropical radiative forcing has a disproportionate effect on mean global forcings. On the basis of Lindzen (2007), the anthropogenic-ear radiative forcing as established in Eqn. (3) are divided by 3 to take account of the observed failure of the tropical mid-troposphere to warm as projected by the models -\n \n &#916;F2x&#8776; 3.405 / 3 &#8776; 1.135 W m^-2. (17)\n\n \n Now this is odd. He divides the forcing by 3 on the basis of Lindzen (2007)? But Lindzen writes that (pg. 945-6):\n \n \nFor reference purposes, the radiative forcing associated with a doubling of CO2 is about 3.5 watts per square meter (as noted in the last 3 IPCC Scientific Assessments).\n\n \n So clearly Lindzen disagrees that the forcing ought to be a third of the standard estimate. Could he have used this (pg. 948)?\n \n \nUsing basic theory, modeling results and observations, we can reasonably bound the anthropogenic contributions to surface warming since 1979 to a third of the observed warming, leading to a climate sensitivity too small to offer any significant measure of alarm-assuming current observed surface and tropospheric trends and model depictions of greenhouse warming are correct.\n\n \n But this is not talking about sensitivity, not forcing.\n \n Archangel, since you approvingly cite Monckton, perhaps you could empirically justify this rather baffling move for me?",

These measurements show that atmospheric CO2 has increased globally by about 100 ppm over the past 250 years.\n \n 2) There are dozens of projects taking CO2 measurements all over the globe(from land-based stations, ships and aircraft) and these data sets are maintained by the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (all of which are available on their website). However, not all of these projects have been under continuous operation, or under continuous operation for as long as the stations already mentioned. In addition, they tend to lack the remoteness to sources and sinks which prevents short run variability, a benefit of those found at Mauna Loa and Bearing Head.\n \n There is no debate about this.

Bias your transmitters positively. You produce atmospheric heating in the air in the IZ, so that the air expands and you have produced a \"low\" pressure zone. Now use a second interferometer biased negatively, and place it at a distant IZ desired. In that IZ, you cool the air so that it shrinks and becomes denser, and you have created a \"high\" pressure area. Now place several such IZs, with the desired highs and lows, near a jet stream. The jet stream will be deviated toward a low and away from a high. By varying the transmitted energy and the iz location (just move it gradually along), you can entrain and steer the jet streams, and therefore effectively \"steer\" the resulting weather. \n Want to spawn tornadoes? Just make several sharp bends in the jet streams, and also speed them up a bit. The additional angular momentum imparted to the air masses will spawn off littler rotations (tornadoes). By focusing the IZ underneath the ocean, one can heat or cool the water in a selected area, over a period of time. So you can aggravate or ease El Nino, e.g. By proper steering and coordination around the earth, the KGB is able to create a great deal of rain in an area, a drought in an area, storms and tornadoes, a powerful El Nino, etc.",

It's highly ingnorant to think that we can change the constitution of the atmosphere and not cause an effect.\n\n Another aspect to your positive feedback loop is that there is a heap load of CO2 locked up in the ice caps that are melting, so ice melting means less heat reflected and more CO2 in the atmosphere, which means higher temperatures, which means more ice melting, which means less heat reflected and more CO2 in the atmos . . . etc etc etc.",

   "This CO2 distribution discussion needs to be applied in relation to the 'increase' of CO2 above the baseline of 3%. The amounts of CO2 in the upper atmosphere have not been independantly measured, that I am aware of, and CO2 close to the ground, i.e. smog, along with asphalt and buildings - create heat islands. We should all be in agreement that New York city is definately a warmer place than it was 50 years ago and I am willing to bet that that the CO2 levels are higher in most of the East coast than it was 50 years ago.\n \n However, the cycle is not overwhelmed. There is no evidence of it being overwhelmed. The CO2 is recycled into the oceans to grow algae. Recycled in to trees that grow more rapidly. Test the levels above the oceans and prove that it is higher there as well. That's the point.\n \n I understand the idea of convection currents and that heavier elements will stay aloft in a breeze for a length of time. But to say that your measurements in Hawaii atop a volcano is going to be the same concentration as the jet stream over the Pacific just doesn't make sense.\n \n Personally I am more concerned about the deteriorating Magnet Field and the subsequant weakening of the Ionosphere's abilty to protect us from the sun. If all the money and energy that went into Global Warming - went into finding practical ways to protect us from the increasing harmful rays, we would be better off.\n\n \n I'm forced to discontinue any discussion with you until you take the time to remedy your ignorance of basic facts. It is just wrong that \"CO2 in the upper atmosphere have not been independantly measured.\" It is just wrong that CO2 concentrations above the oceans have not been measured. Smallax, i've shown you were you can see the data on this, and yet, you continue on as if nothing had been said.\n \n It is also wrong that sinks are sufficent to absorb the quantity of CO2 humans are releasing. Smallax, the data on this is readily available, and is summarized in the IPCC AR4 Group 1 report, chapter 7.3.\n \n It is wrong that the urban heat island effect can account for any significant portion of the observed global mean warming trend. Check the rural station temperature data against the full set (also in the AR4; and also see Peterson 2003 and Parker 2004).\n \n Seriously dude, what's your problem?",

How would those CO2 measurements in the ice, compare to the previous 5000 feet?\n \n They did have measurement of heat in the stratosphere and troposphere - one warmer and one colder, so was glad to see they made that step. :) However there wasn't any charting of CO2 measurements.",

   "Agreed on all counts. Either way regarding the details of Co2 in the atmosphere, it is carried around the upper atmosphere by way of the jet stream and is dissipated and dispersed around the globe. And let's face it, all we have to do is watch todays weather to see that the asphalt jungles we have built aren't large enough to stop the cold from coming. If Mand made Global Warming was real, rather than see natural weather cycles as we do, we would see Arctic melt offs taking place in the winters and New York being warm when other rural areas are cold.\n \n \n \n You have effectively shown that there are Co2 hot spots around the globe.

I think he was implying they are responsible for contributing to melting the Ice shelfs above them as they warm the water below. Here's an excerpt and the photo:\n \n http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/mt-erebus.jpgIt seems that we still don't know everything there is to know about our earth-climate system. Take this for example. Scientists have just now discovered an active volcano under the Antarctic ice that \"creates melt-water that lubricates the base of the ice sheet and increases the flow towards the sea\".\n \n Yet many claim the CO2 is the driver for any melting of the Antarctic ice sheet. I wonder how this will figure into that argument?\n \n Larsen Ice Shelves A and B, by the way, sit astride a chain of volcanic vent islands known as the Seal Nunataks, which may figure into melting and breakups like this and this. (h/t Alan)\n \n In fact, there are a LOT of volcanoes in Antarctica as you can see in this image. Notice that many are near the edge of the ice, and there are none in the interior, which may be a lack of discovery of ancient ice buried volcanoes. Most scientific bases are near the sea, rather than inland, for supply and weather tolerance purposes and there are many places in the interior that have yet to be fully explored.\n \n These images showing known Antarctic volcanoes and satellite measured temperature trends from 1992-2004 below tends to back up the idea that where there is volcanic activity, temperatures have been rising.\n \n The first evidence of a volcanic eruption from beneath Antarctica's ice sheet has been discovered by members of the British Antarctic Survey.\n \n The volcano on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet began erupting some 2,000 years ago and remains active to this day. Using airborne ice-sounding radar, scientists discovered a layer of ash produced by a 'subglacial' volcano. It extends across an area larger than Wales. The volcano is located beneath the West Antarctic ice sheet in the Hudson Mountains at latitude 74.6\u00b0South, longitude 97\u00b0West.Surprise!

The problem is not so much learning about the technology, but who is controlling it and the purposes they will use it for. \n \n Here's a link that speaks to the dangers of HAARP.\n \n Exotic Research Report | Vol 1 No 1 | HAARP: Environmental Warfare\n The US Government has a new ground-based \u00ecStar Wars\u00ee weapon which is being tested in the remote bush country of Alaska. This new system manipulates the environment in a way which can:\n \n Disrupt human mental processes.\n Jam all global communications systems.\n Change weather patterns over large areas.\n Interfere with wildlife migration patterns.\n Negatively affect your health.\n Unnaturally impact the Earth\u00eds upper atmosphere.\n \n The US military calls its zapper HAARP (High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program). But this skybuster is not about the northern lights. The device will turn on lights never intended to be artificially manipulated.\n \n The Dangers of HAARP\n Independent scientists have stated that the result of deliberately altering the ionosphere could be global vandalism, and that such experiments could affect people\u00eds moods and mental functions; the radiation which the HAARP transmitters bounce off of the ionosphere and into the ground are at the same frequencies as predominate human brain waves.\n \n This month the U.S. military continues its experimentation in the first phase of the HAARP program. Extremely powerful beams of radio- frequency energy will pulse into the upper atmosphere and return to spray the surface of the planet with electromagnetic radiation. The military insists that all of this is safe.\n \n However, the risks of HAARP have been exposed through careful research involving hundreds of source documents. Questions have arisen in the research...Could these manmade disturbances trigger destructive weather? And as the radiation bounces back to Earth, what will it do to our health? To salmon or other species which rely on the naturally occurring geomagnetic fields for direction? ",

Yet with the evidence they claim exists, they don't ask why it isn't interrupting how cold it gets in the winter. But every single summer when we have even a blip of a heat wave now adays, the IPCC claims it is due to Man made Global warming. Why's that I ask. \n \n If heat waves which are historically normal in the summer are blamed on man made GW, why don't they also expect warmer winters? It's called Global Warming after all. It should affect weather all year round. I mean, I'm sorry for confusing you with common sense questions, but it seems rather obvious to me that something in the GW claim is seriously missing if it isn't at least causing warmer winters, if not warm winters. \n \n Don't get me wrong, if these alleged experts weren't crying about this man made curse on our environment every summer causing warmer weather when it's supposed to be hot anyway, then I wouldn't be asking these questions. But as long as they are making these claims, then how about we take it to the next logical level and ask why it isn't affecting our winters? Here's an example of what I'm talking about.\n 2008 was the year man-made global warming was disproved\n Looking back over my columns of the past 12 months, one of their major themes was neatly encapsulated by two recent items from The Daily Telegraph.\n \n By Christopher Booker \n \n Polar bears will be fine after all Photo: AP\n \n The first, on May 21, headed \"Climate change threat to Alpine ski resorts\" , reported that the entire Alpine \"winter sports industry\" could soon \"grind to a halt for lack of snow\". The second, on December 19, headed \"The Alps have best snow conditions in a generation\" , reported that this winter's Alpine snowfalls \"look set to beat all records by New Year's Day\".\n Easily one of the most important stories of 2008 has been all the evidence suggesting that this may be looked back on as the year when there was a turning point in the great worldwide panic over man-made global warming. Just when politicians in Europe and America have been adopting the most costly and damaging measures politicians have ever proposed, to combat this supposed menace, the tide has turned in three significant respects.\n First, all over the world, temperatures have been dropping in a way wholly unpredicted by all those computer models which have been used as the main drivers of the scare. Last winter, as temperatures plummeted, many parts of the world had snowfalls on a scale not seen for decades. This winter, with the whole of Canada and half the US under snow, looks likely to be even worse. After several years flatlining, global temperatures have dropped sharply enough to cancel out much of their net rise in the 20th century.\n Ever shriller and more frantic has become the insistence of the warmists, cheered on by their army of media groupies such as the BBC, that the last 10 years have been the \"hottest in history\" and that the North Pole would soon be ice-free - as the poles remain defiantly icebound and those polar bears fail to drown. All those hysterical predictions that we are seeing more droughts and hurricanes than ever before have infuriatingly failed to materialise.\n Even the more cautious scientific acolytes of the official orthodoxy now admit that, thanks to \"natural factors\" such as ocean currents, temperatures have failed to rise as predicted (although they plaintively assure us that this cooling effect is merely \"masking the underlying warming trend\", and that the temperature rise will resume worse than ever by the middle of the next decade).\n Secondly, 2008 was the year when any pretence that there was a \"scientific consensus\" in favour of man-made global warming collapsed. At long last, as in the Manhattan Declaration last March, hundreds of proper scientists, including many of the world's most eminent climate experts, have been rallying to pour scorn on that \"consensus\" which was only a politically engineered artefact, based on ever more blatantly manipulated data and computer models programmed to produce no more than convenient fictions.\n Thirdly, as banks collapsed and the global economy plunged into its worst recession for decades, harsh reality at last began to break in on those self-deluding dreams which have for so long possessed almost every politician in the western world. As we saw in this month's Poznan conference, when 10,000 politicians, officials and \"environmentalists\" gathered to plan next year's \"son of Kyoto\" treaty in Copenhagen, panicking politicians are waking up to the fact that the world can no longer afford all those quixotic schemes for \"combating climate change\" with which they were so happy to indulge themselves in more comfortable times.\n Suddenly it has become rather less appealing that we should divert trillions of dollars, pounds and euros into the fantasy that we could reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by 80 per cent. All those grandiose projects for \"emissions trading\", \"carbon capture\", building tens of thousands more useless wind turbines, switching vast areas of farmland from producing food to \"biofuels\", are being exposed as no more than enormously damaging and futile gestures, costing astronomic sums we no longer possess.2008 was the year man-made global warming was disproved - Telegraph\n \n Here's another link which asks similar questions to mine, and admits that many scientists are now admitting that there are too many variables that can affect the weather to say that an increase in Co2 is the culprit. An interesting read. \n \n Is Winter 2008 Making Climate Alarmists Question Global Warming? | NewsBusters.org\n \n Here's another link that says the founder of the Weather Channel is so miffed at Algore that he wants to sue him for fraud.

Your graph shows very natural reasons for the temperature rise which occurred from 1980-2005. Which was just a blip in time from the worlds perspective. No where did that chart show that an increase in man made pollution affect the temperature though. And all it did show for a temp change was a -0.2% in 1980 to a +0.3% increase in 2005, 25 years later, this represents only a 0.5% increase. Not a reason for panic in my humble opinion. And since your graph attributed it to natural cycles which Man can't control, does that evidence justify the institution of Carbon Credits and all of the other expensive solutions being created for what is potentially a non existent problem?\n Anthropogenic Global Warming is Nonsense\n \n Here is what my second link above points out: http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2008/03/02/winter-2008-making-climate-alarmists-question-global-warming\n According to a host of climate experts, including some who question the extent and risks of global warming, it is mostly good old-fashioned weather, along with a cold kick from the tropical Pacific Ocean, which is in its La Ni\u00f1a phase for a few more months, a year after it was in the opposite warm El Ni\u00f1o pattern.\n \n If anything else is afoot &#8212; like some cooling related to sunspot cycles or slow shifts in ocean and atmospheric patterns that can influence temperatures &#8212; an array of scientists who have staked out differing positions on the overall threat from global warming agree that there is no way to pinpoint whether such a new force is at work.\n \n Interesting, wouldn't you agree? Sounds almost like the position of the realists.\n \n After all, Revkin claimed \"there is no way to pinpoint whether such a new force is at work\" in driving down temperatures that have been observed in the past few months. Well, realists believe there's no way to \"pinpoint\" what forces are responsible for the global warming trend in the past 150 years.\n \n Sounds like common ground, doesn't it?\n \n To better define the realist view, such scientists, meteorologists, and climatologists feel that there are many factors impacting the weather, and that, despite claims by alarmists, there is absolutely no definitive proof that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is the primary culprit behind a slight rise in average global temperatures since 1850.\n Especially since there were no Industrial contributers going back to 1850, so to attempt to make an anthropogenic link over that length of time just doesn't make logical sense. So I'm not denying that there are temperature fluctuations on Earth at all, both highs and lows over time. I'm arguing that to say categorically that MAN MADE POLLUTION is having a serious impact at this time or has been a serious contributing factor to variables in temperatures which happen very naturally on Earth no matter what Man does is questionable in the very least, and completely unproven at best. Even your graph showed that after all by not indicting man made pollution directly for the very slight changes it reflects. \n \n It should also be pointed out that during those same 25 year, Cosmologists know and have documented an increase in Solar Flare activity.",

Your graph shows very natural reasons for the temperature rise which occurred from 1980-2005.\n\n \n Haha!\n \n Did you read a word I wrote, Archangel? The graph does not show \"natural reasons for the temperature rise which occured from 1980-2005.\" The authors of the graph understand that the trend over that period is the result of anthropogenic CO2. What they also understand is that short term variability--the blue lines--is often attributable to natural variation, something you say global warming does not allow for. They also understand that short term cooling is no sign that \"global warming has stopped\".\n \n Short term cooling relative to years earlier in the early 1980s due to a volcano eruption =/= the upward trend in temperature since the 1970s is due to natural causes.\n \n \nWhich was just a blip in time from the worlds perspective. No where did that chart show that an increase in man made pollution affect the temperature though. And all it did show for a temp change was a -0.2% in 1980 to a +0.3% increase in 2005, 25 years later, this represents only a 0.5% increase. Not a reason for panic in my humble opinion.\n\n \n The units on that axis are degrees C, not percentages, there chief.\n \n \nAnd since your graph attributed it to natural cycles which Man can't control, does that evidence justify the institution of Carbon Credits and all of the other expensive solutions being created for what is potentially a non existent problem?\n\n \n But that isn't true, as I've said.\n \n \n[snip]\n\n \n I have no interest in reading or responding to every conseverative website you're able to google. If you want to present me with some data that is actually relevant, as opposed to unevidenced assertions, i'll be happy to listen.\n \n \nEspecially since there were no Industrial contributers going back to 1850, so to attempt to make an anthropogenic link over that length of time just doesn't make logical sense. So I'm not denying that there are temperature fluctuations on Earth at all, both highs and lows over time. I'm arguing that to say categorically that MAN MADE POLLUTION is having a serious impact at this time or has been a serious contributing factor to variables in temperatures which happen very naturally on Earth no matter what Man does is questionable in the very least, and completely unproven at best. Even your graph showed that after all by not indicting man made pollution directly for the very slight changes it reflects.\n\n \n This is the funniest bit of them all. Archangel, who is saying global temperature has been driven primarily by anthropogenic forcings from 1850 onward? Archangel, are you really telling me that because the graph I showed you did not contain the words \"CO2\" next to a trend line, it \"shows\" that CO2 is not responsible for driving the upward movement in global mean temperature?\n \n Archangel, are you being this obtuse on purpose? \n \n \nIt should also be pointed out that during those same 25 year, Cosmologists know and have documented an increase in Solar Flare activity.\n\n \n This is wrong, as I pointed out in post 34. Please reread it.\n \n If you find any factual errors, feel free to correct them with reference to the data. If not, you should admit and retract your error.

[not got to this stage entirely but already people are starting to talk about \"mitigation\" rather than prevention]\n\n \n I don't see our attitude as conservative so much as realistic Jo. And none of us deny that Manmade industry contributes to Co2 based air pollution. What we do disagree on is that #1) We in the West who are using the most advanced scrubber and anti-pollution technologies can cut emissions much more without breaking the bank, and 2) the true culprits which are China, India, Pakistan, Russia and every single other Third World Country with an ever expanding Industrial complex who currently make minimum investment in anti-pollution technologies, and who's daily contributions to this problem will overwhelm and nullify anything more that we do should be ignored in favor of spending the billions we must invest in order to accomplish an additional 2 or 3% cut in our own emissions.\n \n Our limited resources would be much better spent buying the antipollution technology which exists and installing it for free in these other Countries factories in exchange for even a small discount in return for the goods we normally buy from them. The effect of that type of investment would immediately translate into tens of thousands of tons of heavy metals being spewed into the atmosphere in the first year alone, and would allow us to get a real and verifiable handle on this problem in a set amount of time of within 10 to 20 years. \n \n Imagine a world where every industrial smokestack was equipped with scrubber technology which emitted clean white steam rather than the thick black CFCs, Co2 and Heavy Metals which are reminiscent of our stacks back in the 70s? That is a real and viable solution which could actually fix the problem of worldwide Industrial air pollution in an established amount of time. \n \n Of course as new technologies grew, we would naturally adopt them making less polluting cars and energy sources which would naturally increase year by year, but at the same time, the major contributors of Industrial pollution would be steadily decreasing because we would be putting our limited resources into focussing on the crux of the problem. To summarize, we aren't in denial that any problem exists at all. We are in disagreement of where the very limited available resources should go to accomplish the most in getting to where we want to get to in actually fixing the problem of worldwide, third world Industrial air pollution. \n \n And at the same time, we could deal with third world toxic waste water technology and reclamation, which is in place here already but only a distant dream to the industrial planners and engineers who work in these third world countries.\n \n It also needs to be noted that in spite of the out of control emission releases from third world polluters, the Earth itself isn't overwhelmed to the point that we have passed the point of no return by any means at all. In spite of the number of polluting countries currently offending, unchecked; this is why we respond to the scare tactics being used by the militant environmentalists so vehemently. I truly believe that if they were a part of the solution rather than a part of the problem, they would be pushing the international powers that be, like the IPCC to place their resources into this type of remedy i've outlined rather than continuing to focus on the agenda they are currently promoting which will return minimal actual benefits for the cost of the investment.",

You just rejected my responses out of hand, but that doesn't mean they weren't honest and sincere answers based on my interpretation of the facts. So don't bother answering my question. I doubt you could justify your devotion to tax credits anyway since it's crazy to think that we could tax our way out of an environmental problem. Only in the mind of a liberal would that tact make sense.\n \n Also, go through your posts and count up the direct questions you have asked me. From what I can see, all you did is preach your anthropogenic psycho-babble and expect me to take your word for it as you rejected every supporting link I posted. But like a typical pseudo intellectual, you demand data from me while expecting me to consider what you say is fact.\n \n \n \n \n \nWhat on earth? Where are you getting these ridiculous notions, Archangel?\n \n Start with the first one. Why is it that you think anthropogenic global warming predicts that absense of \"natural weather cycles\"? Please be specific and cite primary sources.\n\n \n \nHi Art, I am the primary source for what I said. Why must you people always rely on others to tell you how and what you must think? Just think about it independently for once. The alleged problem is called MANMADE GLOBAL WARMING. They are implying that all of the pollutants we have spewed into the atmosphere are greater than the world is capable of cleansing. They are also saying that we are changing the weather patterns when it fits their agenda, usually in August when it's the hottest time of the year.\n \n Notice they get awfully quiet when uncommon cold snaps hit like we're experiencing now though. Algore is no where to be seen all of a sudden. But it just stands to reason and is common sense that if humans made pollution was really overwhelming the worldwide climate systems, then we would see arctic melting in the winter time which would surely be solid evidence of GLOBAL WARMING. We would also see that large cities like New York which produce the greater levels of Co2 in a confined area would be environmental hot spots if you will. After all, the GW claim is that the atmosphere is already overloaded with Co2 with no place to go. So we should be seeing the impact of this affecting the temps in large, highly polluted cities first which would generate their own microsytems. But strangely enough, we're not. \n \n Remember Gores dire warnings with the polar bear with no place to go? That's at 4:02 into this video. \n YouTube - Scare Tactics in Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth\n\n \n \nYikes. Yikes yikes yikes.\n \n Archangel, science deals with facts, see. Evidence. Data. Falsified predictions of a theory (which is what you ascribed to the consensus theory) are only falsified predictions if they are actually predictions, and if the data actually runs counter to them. This is why primary sources are important, friend. Something you dream up doesn't become a problem merely you imagine it to be so.\n \n So i'll ask you again. What facts (that is, data, which can be found in the primary scientific literature) suggest to you that anthropogenic global warming predicts the absense of \"natural weather cycles\"? What outside of your imagination would lead you, or anyone else, to believe this?\n \n What facts would lead you or anyone else to believe that arctic ice would \"surely\" be melting during the winter if the observing warming trend in recent decades were driven by anthropogenic CO2? Maybe you just pulled this idea out of a hat?\n\n \n \nScience is also supposed to ask questions Art. Questions which are based on the alleged available evidence. Yet with the evidence they claim exists, they don't ask why it isn't interrupting how cold it gets in the winter. But every single summer when we have even a blip of a heat wave now adays, the IPCC claims it is due to Man made Global warming. Why's that I ask. \n \n If heat waves which are historically normal in the summer are blamed on man made GW, why don't they also expect warmer winters? It's called Global Warming after all. It should affect weather all year round. I mean, I'm sorry for confusing you with common sense questions, but it seems rather obvious to me that something in the GW claim is seriously missing if it isn't at least causing warmer winters, if not warm winters. \n \n Don't get me wrong, if these alleged experts weren't crying about this man made curse on our environment every summer causing warmer weather when it's supposed to be hot anyway, then I wouldn't be asking these questions. But as long as they are making these claims, then how about we take it to the next logical level and ask why it isn't affecting our winters? Here's an example of what I'm talking about.\n 2008 was the year man-made global warming was disproved\n Looking back over my columns of the past 12 months, one of their major themes was neatly encapsulated by two recent items from The Daily Telegraph.\n \n By Christopher Booker \n \n Polar bears will be fine after all Photo: AP\n \n The first, on May 21, headed \"Climate change threat to Alpine ski resorts\" , reported that the entire Alpine \"winter sports industry\" could soon \"grind to a halt for lack of snow\". The second, on December 19, headed \"The Alps have best snow conditions in a generation\" , reported that this winter's Alpine snowfalls \"look set to beat all records by New Year's Day\".\n Easily one of the most important stories of 2008 has been all the evidence suggesting that this may be looked back on as the year when there was a turning point in the great worldwide panic over man-made global warming. Just when politicians in Europe and America have been adopting the most costly and damaging measures politicians have ever proposed, to combat this supposed menace, the tide has turned in three significant respects.\n First, all over the world, temperatures have been dropping in a way wholly unpredicted by all those computer models which have been used as the main drivers of the scare. Last winter, as temperatures plummeted, many parts of the world had snowfalls on a scale not seen for decades. This winter, with the whole of Canada and half the US under snow, looks likely to be even worse. After several years flatlining, global temperatures have dropped sharply enough to cancel out much of their net rise in the 20th century.\n Ever shriller and more frantic has become the insistence of the warmists, cheered on by their army of media groupies such as the BBC, that the last 10 years have been the \"hottest in history\" and that the North Pole would soon be ice-free - as the poles remain defiantly icebound and those polar bears fail to drown. All those hysterical predictions that we are seeing more droughts and hurricanes than ever before have infuriatingly failed to materialise.\n Even the more cautious scientific acolytes of the official orthodoxy now admit that, thanks to \"natural factors\" such as ocean currents, temperatures have failed to rise as predicted (although they plaintively assure us that this cooling effect is merely \"masking the underlying warming trend\", and that the temperature rise will resume worse than ever by the middle of the next decade).\n Secondly, 2008 was the year when any pretence that there was a \"scientific consensus\" in favour of man-made global warming collapsed. At long last, as in the Manhattan Declaration last March, hundreds of proper scientists, including many of the world's most eminent climate experts, have been rallying to pour scorn on that \"consensus\" which was only a politically engineered artefact, based on ever more blatantly manipulated data and computer models programmed to produce no more than convenient fictions.\n Thirdly, as banks collapsed and the global economy plunged into its worst recession for decades, harsh reality at last began to break in on those self-deluding dreams which have for so long possessed almost every politician in the western world. As we saw in this month's Poznan conference, when 10,000 politicians, officials and \"environmentalists\" gathered to plan next year's \"son of Kyoto\" treaty in Copenhagen, panicking politicians are waking up to the fact that the world can no longer afford all those quixotic schemes for \"combating climate change\" with which they were so happy to indulge themselves in more comfortable times.\n Suddenly it has become rather less appealing that we should divert trillions of dollars, pounds and euros into the fantasy that we could reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by 80 per cent. All those grandiose projects for \"emissions trading\", \"carbon capture\", building tens of thousands more useless wind turbines, switching vast areas of farmland from producing food to \"biofuels\", are being exposed as no more than enormously damaging and futile gestures, costing astronomic sums we no longer possess.2008 was the year man-made global warming was disproved - Telegraph\n \n Here's another link which asks similar questions to mine, and admits that many scientists are now admitting that there are too many variables that can affect the weather to say that an increase in Co2 is the culprit. An interesting read. \n \n Is Winter 2008 Making Climate Alarmists Question Global Warming? | NewsBusters.org\n \n Here's another link that says the founder of the Weather Channel is so miffed at Algore that he wants to sue him for fraud. If you scroll down the page, you'll also see other links regarding the GW issue.\n \n Global Warming? NOAA: Coolest Winter for US & World Since 2001 ... Weather Channel Founder Wants to Sue Al Gore for Fraud | Scared Monkeys\n\n \n \nIn fact, i'll do it right now. GISTEMP global mean temperature data is here. Blue lines represent eight year averages. Some are positive, some are negative, but the overall long term trend is positive. \n \n Climatologists accept and predict these things will happen. What sorts factors are responsible? Labeled on the graph are the eruptions of Pinatubo and El Chichon, which pumped the atmosphere full of sulfate aerosols. There is internal variability from El Nino. There are external forcings like the sun's 11 year cycle (of which we're currently at the minimum). Archangel, every climate scientist understands this. Anthropogenic global warming accounts for the upward trend in global mean temperature over the past several decades; it does not, and never has, predicted that every year will be hotter than the next.\n \n That you find this strawman so obvious says nothing about the actual science and quite a bit about your ignorance of it.\n\n \n \nI find it interesting that you're claiming I'm ignorant of the subject when you have just confirmed what I have been pointing out. Your graph shows very natural reasons for the temperature rise which occurred from 1980-2005. Which was just a blip in time from the worlds perspective. No where did that chart show that an increase in man made pollution affect the temperature though. And all it did show for a temp change was a -0.2% in 1980 to a +0.3% increase in 2005, 25 years later, this represents only a 0.5% increase. Not a reason for panic in my humble opinion. And since your graph attributed it to natural cycles which Man can't control, does that evidence justify the institution of Carbon Credits and all of the other expensive solutions being created for what is potentially a non existent problem?\n Anthropogenic Global Warming is Nonsense\n \n Here is what my second link above points out: Is Winter 2008 Making Climate Alarmists Question Global Warming? | NewsBusters.org\n According to a host of climate experts, including some who question the extent and risks of global warming, it is mostly good old-fashioned weather, along with a cold kick from the tropical Pacific Ocean, which is in its La Ni\u00f1a phase for a few more months, a year after it was in the opposite warm El Ni\u00f1o pattern.\n \n If anything else is afoot - like some cooling related to sunspot cycles or slow shifts in ocean and atmospheric patterns that can influence temperatures - an array of scientists who have staked out differing positions on the overall threat from global warming agree that there is no way to pinpoint whether such a new force is at work.\n \n Interesting, wouldn't you agree? Sounds almost like the position of the realists.\n \n After all, Revkin claimed \"there is no way to pinpoint whether such a new force is at work\" in driving down temperatures that have been observed in the past few months. Well, realists believe there's no way to \"pinpoint\" what forces are responsible for the global warming trend in the past 150 years.\n \n Sounds like common ground, doesn't it?\n \n To better define the realist view, such scientists, meteorologists, and climatologists feel that there are many factors impacting the weather, and that, despite claims by alarmists, there is absolutely no definitive proof that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is the primary culprit behind a slight rise in average global temperatures since 1850.\n Especially since there were no Industrial contributers going back to 1850, so to attempt to make an anthropogenic link over that length of time just doesn't make logical sense. So I'm not denying that there are temperature fluctuations on Earth at all, both highs and lows over time. I'm arguing that to say categorically that MAN MADE POLLUTION is having a serious impact at this time or has been a serious contributing factor to variables in temperatures which happen very naturally on Earth no matter what Man does is questionable in the very least, and completely unproven at best. Even your graph showed that after all by not indicting man made pollution directly for the very slight changes it reflects. \n \n It should also be pointed out that during those same 25 year, Cosmologists know and have documented an increase in Solar Flare activity.\n\n \n \nHaha!\n \n Did you read a word I wrote, Archangel? The graph does not show \"natural reasons for the temperature rise which occured from 1980-2005.\" The authors of the graph understand that the trend over that period is the result of anthropogenic CO2. What they also understand is that short term variability--the blue lines--is often attributable to natural variation, something you say global warming does not allow for. They also understand that short term cooling is no sign that \"global warming has stopped\".\n \n Short term cooling relative to years earlier in the early 1980s due to a volcano eruption =/= the upward trend in temperature since the 1970s is due to natural causes.\n \n I have no interest in reading or responding to every conseverative website you're able to google. If you want to present me with some data that is actually relevant, as opposed to unevidenced assertions, i'll be happy to listen.\n \n This is the funniest bit of them all. Archangel, who is saying global temperature has been driven primarily by anthropogenic forcings from 1850 onward? Archangel, are you really telling me that because the graph I showed you did not contain the words \"CO2\" next to a trend line, it \"shows\" that CO2 is not responsible for driving the upward movement in global mean temperature?\n \n Archangel, are you being this obtuse on purpose? \n \n This is wrong, as I pointed out in post 34. Please reread it.\n \n If you find any factual errors, feel free to correct them with reference to the data. If not, you should admit and retract your error. In addition, you've still failed to address the questions I asked of you earlier.\n\n \n \nSo you say. Why did you just post the graph and not the article which accompanied it? It seems you're being evasive here. \n \n Do you know how many volcanic eruptions occur each year? And how high into the atmosphere their columns reach? Here's a graph that breaks down the numbers and their strength. Here's an example of the weakest types which occur every day and every week on average, respectively. Their columns reach from 0.1 to 5 km in height on average, and these are smaller events. It also say's About 50-60 volcanoes erupt every year. 20-30 are effusive (lava flows), 20-30 are explosive. \n \n The volcanic explosivity index was developed by Newhall CG, and Self S in 1982 (J Geophys Res). The index is a scale from 1-8.\n \n VEI\n Description\n 1\n Gentle\n 2\n Explosive\n 3\n Severe\n 4\n Cataclysmic\n 5\n Paroxysmal\n 6\n Colossal\n 7\n Super-colossal\n 8\n Mega-colossal\n \n Volcanic Explosivity Index - John Seach\n \n If you're going to just dismiss my evidence out of hand because you deem it beneath you, while expecting me to accept your opinion as factual, since you haven't actually posted anything more than a graph you lifted from a source, then we have nothing more to discuss now, do we. emoticon_xdonno\n",

   "A reading disability it is. Because i'm such a nice guy, Archangel, i'm going to lay it out so plainly that even you could understand.\n \n You wrote that \"If Mand [sic] made Global Warming was real, rather than see natural weather cycles as we do, we would see Arctic melt offs taking place in the winters and New York being warm when other rural areas are cold.\" I then asked you why it is you believed any of these things, and to cite sources in support. Your response was \"I am the primary source for what I said.\" \n \n Archangel, do you have any evidence that would lead you to think that if the observed warming trend in global mean temperature was the result of anthropogenic carbon, we would not see \"natural weather cycles\"?  Does \"I am the primary source\" mean \"I have no evidence to back this up and simply plucked it out of the aether\"?\n \n Archangel, do you have any evidence that would lead you to think that if the observed warming trend in global mean temperature was the result of anthropogenic carbon, we would expect to see \"arctic melt off taking place in the winters\"? Does \"I am the primary source\" mean \"rather than being an empirically based reality, this is something I made up\"?\n \n Archangel, do you have any evidence that would lead you to think that if the observed warming trend in global mean temperature was the result of anthropogenic carbon, we would expect to see \"New York being warm when other rural areas are cold\"? Indeed, is this not what we actually see (but for completely different reasons)? Does \"I am the primary source\" mean \"this is not something I said based on any data, but rather something I dreamed up\"?\n \n You also wrote that: \"It should also be pointed out that during those same 25 year, Cosmologists know and have documented an increase in Solar Flare activity.\" The apparent implication being that solar forcings can account for the observed warming trend.\n \n Archangel, I already noted that we have direct measurements of solar radiative output from satellites. Over the observed period, there has been no trend in any of the multiple measures (total solar irradiance, UV, etc; see Frohlich & Lean 2004) while there has been an upward trend in global mean temperature. How do you account for this?\n \n In response to my mentioning that volcanism is a natural forcing responsible for short term variability in global mean temperature, you posted a series of random facts about volcanoes. In response, I asked you why you posted what you did and what you thought the implication was because, honestly, I haven't the foggiest idea. Archangel, what was the purpose of what you posted about volcanoes? Do you think volcanoes are driving the warming trend? If so, why? Is there another reason for posting it?\n \n Let me also say that I find this:\n \n \nI doubt you could justify your devotion to tax credits anyway since it's crazy to think that we could tax our way out of an environmental problem. Only in the mind of a liberal would that tact make sense.\n\n \n comical in the extreme. First of all, I am not a liberal in the modern American sense, which is what I assume you mean. Second, that a Pigovian environmental tax (not a \"tax credit\") is \"crazy\" would come as a real surprise to economists (my formal education is in economics, for the record) who overwhelmingly support it over command-and-control regulations and/or cap-and-trade schemes (see, e.g. Fuller & Geide-Stevenson 2003 for the survey data). This includes economists from all sides of the political spectrum. It's all very easy and relatively straight-foward.

Any literate person following this thread can see that. You, however, seem to have some difficultly with it, so for your benefit, I have laid them out in a single post, in a row, complete with bolding.\n\n \n And I answered your questions very honestly. You just didn't like my answers. Here's what I did and what you rejected out of hand. Because I don't require others to tell me what is ok to think based on data which in many cases is misinterpreted, I have taken the discussion to the next obvious level and asked questions based on obvious deductions which are extrapolated from the claims made by GW proponents.\n \n For example, It is asserted that HUMAN CAUSED GLOBAL WARMING is raising the temperature around the world due to the insertion of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, right? Now, ask yourself what that implies. To do that we can look at any tropical rain forest and see natural examples of what this man made problem is leading to on a world wide scale. \n \n The great fear of GW scientists, and in fact their warnings are rife with predictions that the polar ice caps will eventually melt off and raise the Sea levels around the world by whatever level, since they rarely agree on how much land would be reclaimed by rising Sea levels. They all agree though that it will be devastating and would reclaim millions of acres of coastal land, worldwide. \n \n In any event, this scenario perfectly describes what GW proponents fear is not only coming, but to some degree is already here. They have, and in fact algores \"An Inconvenient Truth\" lays out this very scenario which won him the Nobel Prize. So for you to claim I'm the ignorant one regarding my question about why we aren't seeing warmer winters flies in the face of having a consistent view of what GW claims will be the result of green house gasses overwhelming the worlds atmosphere and changing our weather by raising the world wide temperatures. The Earth will become one big tropical world when GW has completed its transformation of the planet at that time according to the proponents of GW.\n \n Here's a link which you will no doubt agree with which lays out a doomsday scenario. Global warming: a timeline | COSMOS magazine\n \n Notice how these studies and conclusions come to from 2000-2007 are completely misinterpreting what is reality today. \n 2000\n \n \u0095 1990s are named as the hottest decade on record.\n \n 2001\n \n \u0095 IPCC's third report declares the evidence for man-made global warming to be incontrovertible although the effects on the climate are hard to pin down.\n \n \u0095 The United States, the biggest single greenhouse-gas polluter, abandons the Kyoto Protocol.

Bush questions scientific consensus on global warming, says the treaty is too expensive for the U.S. economy and unfair as big developing countries escape binding emissions pledges.\n \n \u0095 Kyoto signatories minus the U.S. agree on the treaty's rulebook, opening the way to ratification process.\n \n 2004\n \n \u0095 The International Energy Agency (IEA) says China is now the world's second biggest carbon emitter, due to rising use of fossil fuels.\n \n 2005\n \n \u0095 Kyoto Protocol takes effect on February 16.\n \n \u0095 Global warming takes centre stage at G8 summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, where leaders acknowledge climate change to be \"a serious and long-term challenge.\"\n \n \u0095 Awareness, and concern, of global warming surges in U.S. after an exceptional season for tropical storms, punctuated by Hurricane Katrina.\n \n 2006\n \n \u0095 Former U.S. vice president Al Gore's docu-movie \"An Inconvenient Truth\" drives global warming up the U.S. political agenda.\n \n \u0095 California unveils plans for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and files lawsuits against six vehicle manufacturers for their contribution to global warming.\n \n \u0095 Report by former World Bank economist Sir Nicholas Stern says global warming will cost up to 20 per cent of worldwide gross domestic product if nothing is done.\n \n 2007\n \n \u0095 The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moves the hand of the Doomsday clock forward by two minutes, making it five minutes to midnight, citing global warming and nuclear proliferation.\n \n \u0095 IPCC's fourth assessment says glacial shrinkage, ice loss and permafrost retreat are signs that climate change is already underway. Predicts higher risk of drought, floods and more powerful storms this century, increasing the probability of hunger, homelessness and water-borne disease. Forecasts likely warming of 1.8 to 4.0\u00b0C and raised sea levels of 18 to 59 cm by 2100.\n \n \u0095 September: Meetings are held at the UN in New York and among major emitters in Washington, ahead of talks in December on the issue of deepening cuts after 2012, when the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol expires.\n Here's a hundred year graph: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9e/Risks_and_Impacts_of_Global_Warming.png\n \n And the description:\n Description\n \n \n \n Predicted changes in average surface temperature according to a range of global climate models assuming no significant action is taken to combat global warming.\n This figure, adapted from the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [1], presents a conceptual assessment of the relative impact and risks associated with global warming across five categories of concern.\n The left part of the figure shows the range of mean global temperature change that may occur during the 21st century after accounting for both a wide range of greenhouse gas emission scenarios and the uncertainty associated with global climate models.\n The bars on the figure are colored to suggest the relative impact or concern that should be attributed to each factor as a function of temperature increase. According to the IPCC: \"White indicates neutral or small negative or positive impacts or risks, yellow indicates negative impacts for some systems or low risks, and red means negative impacts or risks that are more widespread and/or greater in magnitude.\" As assessed by the IPCC, the temperature increase of 0.6 \u00b0C between 1900 and 1990 has already produced threats to vulnerable physical, ecological and human systems as well as producing an increase in the extreme weather events. By contrast, the net economic and ecological impact of global warming thus far has been modest/neutral, but threatens to become significantly negative during the first part of this century. Lastly, radical and irreversible large-scale changes, such as the disintegration of major ice sheets, breakdown of thermohaline circulation or the collapse of rain forest ecosystems, is not expected to occur before a several degree increase in temperature. Such an increase may occur by the end of the century.Effects of global warming - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Now Art, are you actually claiming that the GW proponents aren't suggesting that one of the effects of worldwide, manmade Global Warming from increased green house gasses isn't expected to, and even now is impacting world wide weather? And if you accept that info from them, why do you call my questions about why it isn't effecting winter coldness ignorant and that I'm just pulling these ideas out of the air? Forgive me for not using your word, \"aether\", but I find that only pompous pseudo intellectuals who want to sound smarter than they are use such terms to impress. \n \n But I'm not impressed by your selective reasoning at all. It stands to reason in my mind that if Global Warming is real, it should be real all year long, no matter how slight the difference in temps may be. Yet we aren't seeing that at all. So rather than continuing to ask me questions, why don't you start answering them and justify the vast misinterpretations which have been arrived at from the available observations GW proponents have arrived at their conclusions from.",

Barrow and T.M.L. Wigley, all recognized climatologists and self-described climate \"alarmists\" (in Climate and Sea Level Change: Observations, Projections and Implications, from which the hypothesis is taken, they note \"the alarming rate of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide\").

These concerns include the following:\n \n first, that humankind may now be a potent factor in causing unidirectional global changes which could dominate over natural changes on the decade-to-century time scale;\n secondly, that, in terms of recent human experience, changes in climate and sea level could accelerate to unprecedented rates;\n thirdly, that human tinkering with the global climate system could have unforeseen catastrophic consequences (e.g., 'runaway' warming or sea level rise from strong positive feedbacks); and\n finally, that the quickened rates of change could exceed the capacity of natural and human systems to adapt without undue disruption or cost.(1)\n In other words, it's the classic consensus position that the build-up of human carbon emissions rather than natural factors is driving climate change and that we may be heading for disaster. What's right about this hypothesis?\n \n What's right is that both carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and the global temperature have increased since the mid-1800's. Also right is that human emissions have been contributing to this increase in carbon dioxide. Finally, it is true that rapid climate changes could have \"catastrophic consequences\" for humanity.\n \n So, consensus climate science has it right on a number of basic facts. If we go beyond these basic facts, however, the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) hypothesis breaks down rather badly.\n Higher carbon dioxide levels are not a danger to life\n Carbon dioxide levels have risen in the atmosphere from roughly 280 parts per million in the late 19th century to 380 ppm today, a 30 per cent increase in just over a century. In that time, the global temperature has risen about .8 degrees Celsius.(2) Both represent a fairly rapid increase and human beings are responsible for a small portion of that increase.\n \n But is a CO2 level of 380 ppm dangerous in and of itself, for the planet or for us? Would twice this level be dangerous? Three times? The answer is: not at all, as the consensus climate scientists must be fully aware. CO2 levels have been much higher in the geological past - often five to 10 times higher (see Figure 1) - and both plants and animals evolved and thrived.(3)\n \n \n Figure 1. Temperature and CO2 levels over 600 million years\n A warmer planet is not a danger to life\n Is a warmer planet, in and of itself, a danger to life? Again, the answer is no.\n \n For 80 to 90 per cent of its 4.5-billion-year history earth has been warmer, and sometimes up to 15 degrees Celsius warmer, than today.(4) Both the \"golden age\" of dinosaurs and of mammals occurred when CO2 levels and temperatures were much higher than today's.\n \n However, our planet is currently in an ice age, and has been for the past two million years. As Figure 1 shows, carbon dioxide levels and temperatures are the lowest in 250 million years, and among the lowest in 600 million years. We are within five degrees Celsius of entering another period of glaciation, which would be very bad news - far worse than an equivalent amount of warming.(5)\n \n So, the consensus position is correct in stating that temperature levels are increasing (until recently - see \"Is the planet still warming\" on this site) and that CO2 levels are increasing. It is not correct that these increases are, in themselves, a potential \"catastrophe.\"FALSE ALARM: Why Almost Everything We've Been Told About Global Warming is Misleading, Exaggerated, or Plain Wrong What has 'consensus' climate science got right? (Hint: not much)\n \n This link doesn't work.\n \nhttp://http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/\n\n \n \nThe problem being, what stands to reason in your mind is not what actual scientists with scientific educations and scientific instruments to actually make scientific measurements have come up with. If it suits you believe what you want, but I would rather take the word of a professional when it involves something as important as this. Again, global warming is real...it's the cause of that warming that is in question here. Denying that global warming is real is ignorant to the point of being willful.\n\n \n No sn, the problem is that you have forgotten how to think independently, or to ask questions rather than just swallowing what these alleged experts say hook, line and sinker. I am trying to tell you that I don't deny the reality that we have a problem. I just don't buy into the alarmists view of it as the opinion I posted expresses.\n \n And all I'm asking which you all are avoiding even discussing is why aren't we seeing the actual impact on the worlds temperature in the winter when we're allegedly dealing with a world wide global warming event? Unless Global Warming only means increased temps in the summer; if that's the case, someone should clarify that fact. But you know what sp? No one is doing that. \n \n The implication by the alarmists is that this is something that's affecting temps everywhere and that we're in a crisis. Yet here we have all of the Arctic Ice which was disappearing, has come back to record levels. This fact nullifies these points, Polar ice is melting at an alarming rate, Glaciers are retreating at an alarming rate, Sea level is rising at an alarming rate which as we speak aren't happening at all anywhere in the world. Of course come summer time we will be seeing ice melt again. And the alarmists will once again cry that the sky is falling and you will ring your hands as you hate America for daring to live with 21st century comforts as we destroy the planet around us. And Art will be calling for a carbon tax as if we can tax our way out of this non existent problem which man has no power to control anyway.",

   "Just for my education..I doesn't water vapour have a higher greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide?\n\n \n You're absolutely right gansao, but they will just say that the higher temps will cause increased evaporation which means that it's the result of humans anyway. But the facts belie that claim. Here's an interesting read for more info.\n Water Vapor Rules\n the Greenhouse System\n \n \n \n Just how much of the \"Greenhouse Effect\" is caused by human activity?\n \n It is about 0.28%, if water vapor is taken into account-- about 5.53%, if not.\n \n This point is so crucial to the debate over global warming that how water vapor is or isn't factored into an analysis of Earth's greenhouse gases makes the difference between describing a significant human contribution to the greenhouse effect, or a negligible one.\n \n Water vapor constitutes Earth's most significant greenhouse gas, accounting for about 95% of Earth's greenhouse effect (4). Interestingly, many \"facts and figures' regarding global warming completely ignore the powerful effects of water vapor in the greenhouse system, carelessly (perhaps, deliberately) overstating human impacts as much as 20-fold.\n \n Water vapor is 99.999% of natural origin. Other atmospheric greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and miscellaneous other gases (CFC's, etc.), are also mostly of natural origin (except for the latter, which is mostly anthropogenic).\n \n Human activites contribute slightly to greenhouse gas concentrations through farming, manufacturing, power generation, and transportation. However, these emissions are so dwarfed in comparison to emissions from natural sources we can do nothing about, that even the most costly efforts to limit human emissions would have a very small-- perhaps undetectable-- effect on global climate.

   "Yes, it is. And unbeknownst to tq, I actually have a life and respond to posts when I have time.\n\n \n That isn't the issue. The issue is, when you do respond to posts, you don't address the questions asked of you.\n \n \nAnd I answered your questions very honestly. You just didn't like my answers. Here's what I did and what you rejected out of hand. Because I don't require others to tell me what is ok to think based on data which in many cases is misinterpreted, I have taken the discussion to the next obvious level and asked questions based on obvious deductions which are extrapolated from the claims made by GW proponents.\n\n \n I'm in a charitable mood, so i'm going to read this as saying \"I have not based my assertions on any facts whatsoever\" (which would qualify as a direct response to the first three questions above). Given that these assertions are not based on any facts or derived from scientific literature, and given that you have not even attempted to explain why it you think that the things you said follow from anthropogenic global warming, I'm at a real loss to understand why I, or anyone else, ought to seriously consider them. I have no idea why, if the observed warming trend were the result of anthropogenic carbon, there would no natural sources of variation in climate. I can see absolutely no reason why any of the other assertions would follow either, and as they say, what is gratuitously asserted can be gratuitously denied.\n \n Now, answer the questions about the sun and volcanoes.\n \n \nFor example, It is asserted that HUMAN CAUSED GLOBAL WARMING is raising the temperature around the world due to the insertion of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, right? Now, ask yourself what that implies. To do that we can look at any tropical rain forest and see natural examples of what this man made problem is leading to on a world wide scale. \n \n The great fear of GW scientists, and in fact their warnings are rife with predictions that the polar ice caps will eventually melt off and raise the Sea levels around the world by whatever level, since they rarely agree on how much land would be reclaimed by rising Sea levels. They all agree though that it will be devastating and would reclaim millions of acres of coastal land, worldwide.\n\n \n As has already been pointed out, this is exactly what we are seeing; decreases in ice and higher sea levels. \n \n \nIn any event, this scenario perfectly describes what GW proponents fear is not only coming, but to some degree is already here. They have, and in fact algores \"An Inconvenient Truth\" lays out this very scenario which won him the Nobel Prize. So for you to claim I'm the ignorant one regarding my question about why we aren't seeing warmer winters flies in the face of having a consistent view of what GW claims will be the result of green house gasses overwhelming the worlds atmosphere and changing our weather by raising the world wide temperatures. The Earth will become one big tropical world when GW has completed its transformation of the planet at that time according to the proponents of GW.\n\n \n First of all, Archangel, what you said was not that winters will be warmer, but that we'd expect to see arctic ice melting off in the winter. Second, it is absolutely not that case that \"we aren't seeing warmer winters.\" Take a peak at the seasonal GISS data here.\n \n \n[snip of another long, off-topic copypasta job]\n\n \n \nNow Art, are you actually claiming that the GW proponents aren't suggesting that one of the effects of worldwide, manmade Global Warming from increased green house gasses isn't expected to, and even now is impacting world wide weather? And if you accept that info from them, why do you call my questions about why it isn't effecting winter coldness ignorant and that I'm just pulling these ideas out of the air?\n\n \n Because, 1) that was not what you said, and 2) it is wrong.\n \n \nForgive me for not using your word, \"aether\", but I find that only pompous pseudo intellectuals who want to sound smarter than they are use such terms to impress.\n\n \n In the future, i'll remember to dumb it down for you.\n \n \nBut I'm not impressed by your selective reasoning at all. It stands to reason in my mind that if Global Warming is real, it should be real all year long, no matter how slight the difference in temps may be. Yet we aren't seeing that at all. So rather than continuing to ask me questions, why don't you start answering them and justify the vast misinterpretations which have been arrived at from the available observations GW proponents have arrived at their conclusions from.\n\n \n But winters are warmer. The examples of deductive \"reasoning\" you posited prior to this post, i.e. the ones I actually questioned, apparently have no basis in reality.\n \n Finally, I have no idea what \"vast misinterpretations\" you have in mind. The only ones I see here are from you.",

In March 2008, the ice cap rebounded to a near normal winter level. But much of this ice was thin, single year ice and after a record rate of melting in the month of August the ice shrank to its second smallest extent on record. \n \n Comiso: If it keeps on going, then the potential is that you lose the perenial ice altogether. Then we'll have a blue ocean in the Arctic. Now if the ocean becomes blue, there'll be a lot of environmental impacts. There are a lot of ecological impacts. \n \n Narrator: Comiso says the 30 years of satellite data we have on the Arctic sea ice suggest that it's not likely to recover. As a scientist, he is intrigued by the trends, but personally he worries about the planet's future.\n\n \n http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/SeaIce2008.html\n \n \n \nArctic sea ice reached its yearly maximum extent during the second week of March, 2008. Maximum extent was slightly greater compared to recent years, but was still well below average. \n \n Despite strong growth of new ice over the winter, sea ice is still in a general state of decline. The ice that grew over the past winter is relatively thin, first-year ice that is susceptible to melting away during the summer. Although natural variability in the atmospheric circulation could prevent the ice pack from breaking last year's summer record, a closer look at sea ice conditions indicates that the September 2008 minimum extent will almost certainly be well below average. \n\n http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2008/040708.html\n \n \n Now what are you having trouble understanding Archie?",

This is what it say's:\n Though the ice may be melting around the edges of the Greenland Icecap in recent years during the warm mode of the AMO much as it did during the last warm phase in the 1930s to 1950s,\n\n \n Archangel, you set up \"Greenland's glaciers losing ice\" and \"the ice in Greenland's interior is growing\" as \"diametrically opposed\" (your words). But as I explained, these two notions are not, in fact, diametrically opposed. Greenland can be (and is) losing ice mass on the net while gaining a bit in the interior as the result of increased precipitation.\n \n You were wrong. Own it.\n \n \nThere have been warm periods through out the history of the world, and there will be many more if Man doesn't destroy itself through war. But to insist that this most recent one is caused primarily by Man made pollution is assuming evidence which hasn't been proven according to not just me, but a whole independent scientific school of thought.\n\n \n That there have obviously been instances of global warming/cooling in the past unrelated to human activities tells us nothing about the cause of the current upward trend.\n \n There is no \"assuming\" that the observed warming trend in recent decades is primarily the result of anthropogenic CO2. It's based on hard empirical data. See the IPCC AR4 for a review. \n \n \nSo attempt to marginalize my arguments as you will, I'm in no way alone in opposing your alarmist claims.\n\n \n In effect, you are. There are a handful of working climate scientists that are as confused as you are, and even then, they never bother to publish their ideas in peer-reviewed outlets (well, with the exception of social science journals with denialist editors and substandard peer-review processes). But hey, you seem used to that sort of thing.\n \n In any event, the strength of an argument depends on balance of evidence, not on the number of folks who makes similar claims. The consensus theory has the evidence. You make stuff up.\n \n \nIf we had evidence that the atmospheric C02 levels today are higher than they have ever been in the history of the planet, you would not only have a proven and sustainable case, but I would agree with you. But we have ice core samples that show the C02 levels have been much much higher in the past than they are today, yet the evidence we retrieved comes from ICE CORE SAMPLES which proves that even in those periods, ice survived to collect the evidence which proves my point.\n\n \n First of all, as Snakespit has already said, the ice core record shows CO2 levels are currently higher than at any point in the last several hundred thousand years (now back to 650K). Additionally, they show that the rate of increase is significantly higher (Ferretti et al. 2005). So, you're wrong.\n \n Secondly, why does it matter if CO2 levels have been higher in the distant past? Let's suppose the ice core record did show that CO2 levels were higher a hundred thousand years ago. Would it follow that all ice would be expected to melt? Of course not. CO2 increases temperature, but higher than current atmospheric CO2 concentrations do not have to melt all ice everywhere. They could, of course, if they were high enough, but that's a rather different thing, isn't it? \n \n \nFor some reason you ignore the truly long range observations in favor of what we've seen over decades while rejecting my evidence which shows inconsistencies in your reading of what has occurred over those same decades. Go figure, huh.\n\n \n What long range observations am I ignoring, Archangel? What evidence have you presented which \"shows inconsistencies\" in my reading of what has happened over recent decades?

   "I'm bored, so i'm going to go back on my word and respond to this.\n \n \nCould you expound on how this tax is applied and what type of usage it's based on? For example, would the Government allow a certain amount of usage which is expected in order to sustain modern living standards, and then charge a tax for using over that expected limit?\n\n \n The problem with CO2 is one of negative externalities. The basic concept, explained in any introductory microecon textbook, is that the price of goods and services that result in the emission of atmospheric carbon fail to reflect its social cost (that is, the costs it imposes on third parties). As a result, the equilibrium is inefficent; resources are overallocated toward those behaviors, making us poorer overall.\n \n The solution, discovered by my namesake, is to \"internalize the externality\" by taxing it at its (marginal) social cost. The price rises, quantity demanded falls, and we arrive at a new, efficent equilibrium.\n \n Research indicates that today, in current dollars, the marginal social cost of a ton of carbon is about $30 (US). This translates, for example, into a nine cent gas tax and a tax of one cent per kwh on coal-generated power (about 10% of current retail price). Over time, the cost increases as a result of warming-related damages, and the tax would track that. Nordhaus' DICE model, for example, sets the optimum at about $90 in 2050, and $200 in 2100. This would ideally apply to all sources of atmospheric carbon.\n \n In just terms of CO2 concentrations and global mean temperature, this optimal policy would reduce the former relative to a baseline of no action from 1,182.6 ppm in 2200 to 658.5, and the latter from 5.3 degrees C to 3.45 (as in Nordhaus 2008). In terms of present value, it's on the order of several trillion dollars.\n \n \nAnd how do they prevent this tax from just being another economic anchor on the back of the consumers/end users of manufactured products since we know that the Corporations will just pass this expense along to us.\n\n \n Of course the costs will be passed on to consumers. That is, after all, the idea. The thing is though, the resulting decrease in production is also welfare improving. \n \n Additionally, a carbon tax gives us opportunity to reduce or eliminate other taxes that are distorting by rebating its revenue. We can use the money to cut into the payroll tax, for example, leaving the whole thing revenue and distribution neutral while improving work incentives at the same time. It's win-win.",

Sold out to irrational conclusions? LOL. I'm not the one that claimed we have ice core samples showing CO2 levels higher than present day. Speaking of ignorance and irrational conclusions. Strangely, you got very quiet after we pointed out what a load of bunk that was. You were correct in the fact that global CO2 levels have been much higher than present day, but that was ~20 million years ago...and no, we don't have any ice that old. Nor does it tell us anything about the effect of a high CO2 level except that some life can survive these high levels. I think our interest should be more about can we as humans survive such high levels. Personally I think we will be gone or on the verge of extinction long before CO2 and global warming makes this planet uninhabitable for us. \n \n The ignorance is yours. The irrational conclusion is that we can pump mass amounts of CO2, heavy metals, and numerous other products high into the atmosphere and not have an effect on earth. \n \n So I will not agree to disagree with you.

And I'm speaking to snakespit and art too.\n It's time to pray for global warming, says Flint Journal columnist John Tomlinson\n by John Foren | Flint Journal Editor\n Monday January 19, 2009, 4:20 AM\n \n \n \n Flint Journal's\n John Tomlinson\n Read more by him\n \n If you're wondering why North America is starting to resemble nuclear winter, then you missed the news.\n \n At December's U.N. Global Warming conference in Poznan, Poland, 650 of the world's top climatologists stood up and said man-made global warming is a media generated myth without basis. Said climatologist Dr. David Gee, Chairman of the International Geological Congress, \"For how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand that the planet is not warming?\"\n \n I asked myself, why would such obviously smart guy say such a ridiculous thing? But it turns out he's right. \n The earth's temperature peaked in 1998. It's been falling ever since; it dropped dramatically in 2007 and got worse in 2008, when temperatures touched 1980 levels.\n \n Meanwhile, the University of Illinois' Arctic Climate Research Center released conclusive satellite photos showing that Arctic ice is back to 1979 levels. What's more, measurements of Antarctic ice now show that its accumulation is up 5 percent since 1980.\n \n In other words, during what was supposed to be massive global warming, the biggest chunks of ice on earth grew larger. Just as an aside, do you remember when the hole in the ozone layer was going to melt Antarctica? But don't worry, we're safe now, that was the nineties.\n \n Dr. Kunihiko, Chancellor of Japan's Institute of Science and Technology said this: \"CO2 emissions make absolutely no difference one way or the other ... every scientist knows this, but it doesn't pay to say so.\" Now why would a learned man say such a crazy thing?\n \n This is where the looney left gets lost. Their mantra is atmospheric CO2 levels are escalating and this is unquestionably causing earth's temperature rise. But ask yourself -- if global temperatures are experiencing the biggest sustained drop in decades, while CO2 levels continue to rise -- how can it be true?\n \n Ironically, in spite of being shown false, we must now pray for it. Because a massive study, just released by the Russian Government, contains overwhelming evidence that earth is on the verge of another Ice Age.\n \n Based on core samples from Russia's Vostok Station in Antarctica, we now know earth's atmosphere and temperature for the last 420,000 years. This evidence suggests that the 12,000 years of warmth we call the Holocene period is over.\n \n Apparently, we're headed into an ice age of about 100,000 years -- give or take. As for CO2 levels, core samples show conclusively they follow the earth's temperature rise, not lead it.\n \n It turns out CO2 fluctuations follow the change in sea temperature. As water temperatures rise, oceans release additional dissolved CO2 -- like opening a warm brewsky.\n \n To think, early last year, liberals suggested we spend 45 trillion dollars and give up five million jobs to fix global warming. But there is good news: now that we don't have to spend any of that money, we can give it all to the banks.It's time to pray for global warming, says Flint Journal columnist John Tomlinson - Flint, Michigan Columns, Letters & Opinion - The Flint Journal - MLive.com",

   "The Flint columnist, like you, inhabits a different reality to the rest of us. He believes the lies because they fit his comfort zone.\n\n \n So, you believe his comfort zone prefers a Global Ice Age over Global Warming? Then why does the title say we should pray for Global Warming? Thanks again for proving you're unable to form a rational thought penfold as you all deny overwhelming evidence that GW is a fraud and that the trend of all available evidence is pointing toward just the opposite of the GW alarmists fears. Here's what I mean about how the media distorts the facts in order to promote the flawed science. An excerpt from the article:\n O'Brien also included some discussion of how environmentalists claim to predict the weather for the next 100 years. After describing predictive climate modeling in a highly positive fashion, he spoke with MIT climatologist Richard Lindzen, who reminded him that people \"understand that forecasting weather is inaccurate beyond two or three days.\"\n \n The story found little time to go into the criticisms of the analysis of temperature readings that have appeared in The Wall Street Journal recently. One graph, nicknamed the \"hockey stick\" because of its shape, has been used for years to claim that temperatures rose suddenly in the 20th century. However, some of that data was analyzed and found faulty. The statistical technique was biased and tended to draw hockey-stick forms. Even its creator, Dr. Michael Mann from the University of Virginia, admitted this according to the Journal. He's also corrected the other problems, but claims they didn't impact the overall result and won't release all of the data so his work can be checked.\n \n CNN's \"Melting Point\" repeated several other ongoing flaws in media coverage of this environmental debate that were detailed in a November 2004 Business & Media Institute (BMI) study. That analysis, \"Destroying America to Save the World,\" explained how the media skew the debate by claiming the \"science\" of Kyoto is settled when it isn't. \n \n O'Brien's story relied overwhelmingly on \"experts\" who believe in global warming and didn't include an opposing view until nearly a half-hour into the program. This followed the media trend. According to the study, \"Broadcast news programs presented the claims of liberal environmentalists that global warming is a given, that mankind is to blame for it, or both, 55 percent of the time (77 stories).\" O'Brien only had one program, so he said it as often as he could. \n \n In addition, he made several other typical errors covered in the BMI study, including:\n \n Blaming President Bush - O'Brien said: \"President Bush opposes Kyoto\" and implied Bush is to blame for the U.S. not being part of the treaty. He never mentioned that the Senate voted 95-0 against Kyoto. While O'Brien interviewed Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), he didn't mention McCain voted for the resolution that opposed Kyoto along with liberal Sens. John Kerry (D-Mass.) and Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.).\n The Cost of Kyoto: The story gave the projected U.S. cost of signing Kyoto as more than $400 billion each year with a possible loss of 4.9 million jobs. However, it relied on a quote from President Bush that gave the impression it was his opinion. It's actually the result of a U.S. Energy Information Administration analysis. O'Brien did fail to compare the numbers he cited for costs of Kyoto with the costs from a global warming scenario. His numbers for warming over the next 100 years: \"UN estimates somewhere between $20 and $150 billion in property damage in the U.S. alone.\" Using his highest estimate and comparing it to the lowest figure from the Energy Department, the cost of signing the treaty would still be about 133 times more.\n Polar Bears Threatened: \"But the bears are in trouble, big trouble,\" said O'Brien, claiming they could be wiped out. \"For them, it's a matter of survival.\" The networks trot out polar bears any time they want to tug at the heartstrings for global warming and Sunday night's broadcast was no different. In Pat Michaels' book \"Meltdown,\" he explained how the left-wing environmental movement takes advantage of \"cute and furry\" creatures to win the warming debate. \"NGOs [Non-governmental organizations] know the value of a marquee species. Algae won't do. Polar bears will,\" he stated.\n At the end of the program, the voiceover described \"CNN Presents\" as \"separating fact from fiction.\" It didn't.\n CNN's Global Warming Special Typifies Liberal Bias of Climate Coverage",

Only those invited could participate and computer IP addresses of participants were recorded and used to prevent repeat voting. Questions used were reviewed by a polling expert who checked for bias in phrasing, such as suggesting an answer by the way a question was worded. The nine-question survey was short, taking just a few minutes to complete. \n \n Two questions were key: have mean global temperatures risen compared to pre-1800s levels, and has human activity been a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures. \n \n About 90 percent of the scientists agreed with the first question and 82 percent the second. \n \n In analyzing responses by sub-groups, Doran found that climatologists who are active in research showed the strongest consensus on the causes of global warming, with 97 percent agreeing humans play a role. Petroleum geologists and meteorologists were among the biggest doubters, with only 47 and 64 percent respectively believing in human involvement. Doran compared their responses to a recent poll showing only 58 percent of the public thinks human activity contributes to global warming. \n \n \"The petroleum geologist response is not too surprising, but the meteorologists' is very interesting,\" he said. \"Most members of the public think meteorologists know climate, but most of them actually study very short-term phenomena.\" \n \n He was not surprised, however, by the near-unanimous agreement by climatologists. \n \n \"They're the ones who study and publish on climate science. So I guess the take-home message is, the more you know about the field of climate science, the more you're likely to believe in global warming and humankind's contribution to it.\" \n \n Doran and Kendall Zimmerman conclude that \"the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes.\" The challenge now, they write, is how to effectively communicate this to policy makers and to a public that continues to mistakenly perceive debate among scientists. \n\n \n Can you actually find links to the actual research and scientific studies to back up your claims, or will you simply continue to post anti-GW blogs and pretend that they are fact?",

The disrupted ocean currents in turn disrupt climate patterns in coastal regions, which in turn disrupt climate in adjacent regions. The result is an unpredictable mix of warmer weather here, colder weather there, increased intensity of storms over there, more rain over there, etc. It's worrisome to some people because (I assume) so much of our world food-stock is dependent on predictable weather patterns (the cold snap in FL is a good example of this theory).

If excessive monsoon rains like in Pakistan recently start happening every 2-3 years then it begins to move from being an outlier (bound to happen in a chaotic system like the weather) to be something more (an indicator of alteration in the climate). It's probably going to be at least another decade before we can say with any certainty that particular weather patterns are a result of climate change.",
