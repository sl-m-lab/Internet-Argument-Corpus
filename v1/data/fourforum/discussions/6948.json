Two words: Willy Horton\n \n\n The campaign of 1988 marked the political dominance of \"law and order\" over the counter-culture. It found expression in Willy Horton and the election of George Bush. Michael Dukakis, Bush's opponent and the governor of Massachusetts, signed a routine weekend furlough for a convict named Willy Horton, a convicted murderer, who raped a woman and savagely beat her boyfriend while out on a prison release program. The incident became the subject of an intense campaign of political advertising. The lesson of that election was not lost on either Democrats or Republicans. \n http://www.gatelessgate.org/archive/kc/too_many_prisons/\n \n\n \n History of Willy Horton\n \n\n William R. Horton Jr. (born August 12, 1951 in Chesterfield, South Carolina) is a convicted felon who was the subject of a Massachusetts weekend furlough program that released him while serving a life sentence for murder, providing him the opportunity to commit a rape and armed robbery. A political advertisement during the 1988 U.S. Presidential race was critical of the Democratic nominee and Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis for his support of the program.\n \n \n Willie HortonOn October 26, 1974, in Lawrence, Massachusetts, Horton and two accomplices robbed Joseph Fournier, a 17 year old gas station attendant, stabbed him 19 times, and left him in a trash can. Fournier died from blood loss. Horton was convicted of murder, sentenced to life imprisonment, and incarcerated at the Concord Correctional Facility in Massachusetts. On June 6, 1986, he was released as part of a weekend furlough program but did not return.\n \n On April 3, 1987 in Oxon Hill, Maryland, Horton assaulted local resident Clifford Barnes and raped his fianc\u00e9e. He then stole Barnes' car, but was later captured by police after a chase. On October 20, Horton was sentenced in Maryland to two consecutive life terms plus 85 years. The sentencing judge refused to return Horton to Massachusetts, saying, \"I'm not prepared to take the chance that Mr. Horton might again be furloughed or otherwise released. This man should never draw a breath of free air again.\"\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Horton \n\n Keep serving up softballs and I'll hit them out of the park. :) \n Note the highlighted comment by the judge.",

Bad news, the argument there is flawed from the start. In a perfect world, nobody would have been murdered in the first place.\n\n So if we can assume that innocent people are convicted in capital punishment cases, shouldn't we be free to assume that innocent people are being convicted in non-capital punishment cases as well? So should we be able to impose the sentence of life without parole, all the while understanding that we may have put an innocent man in prison for life? All I ask is a little consistency in the argument. And please note, I did not mention the \"perfect world\" argument that you brought up. I understand that the system is flawed, I think everyone knows that the system is flawed. Capital punishment is just that, a punishment. The judicial system is where the flaws lie. I am all for making our judicial system as efficient and accurate as possible, however eliminating capital punishment is not going to keep innocent people from being convicted of crimes. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. \n \n \nThe question comes up becuase arguing for the deterrent effect is really the only way to justify the death penalty. Either killing people is wrong or it is not. In our society, we tend to frown on it. We have decided that it is wrong.

This leads to a rather uncomfortable double standard with them essentailly saying \"they have done something terrible, and now we are going to do it, too\". Generally only young children, or extremely ignorant people, insist that the playground rule of tit-for-tat is a justifiable policy.\n\n I don't really see why I have to justify the death penalty to anyone in the first place. I believe that there are crimes and criminals deserving of the death penalty, and I support it. Nuff said. You may think of it as an arbitrary tit-for-tat policy, but I see it as a legal, court ordered punishment handed down by our judicial system for a crime to which the death penalty is applicable. It's really simple. If you don't want to face the death penalty, do not commit a crime for which you might be sentenced to death. While I have no scientific proof to back this up, I can say from personal experience that I have never commited a capital offense, and therefore have never been sentenced to death. Works for me. \n \n \nIf the person in question is in prison, they are removed from society. They can do no more to harm society. Unless some solid benifit can be shown for killing them, it is simply a childish act of revenge. Most people prefer to believe that we are above childish acts of revenge.\n\n No letting the family or friends of the victim kill the convicted person might be childish revenge. The death penalty is simply a legally imposed punishment given to felons who commited crimes for which the death penalty is applicable. And correct me if I am wrong, but aren't most death sentences recommended by a jury after deliberation of the case facts? Isn't that how our judicial system is supposed to work? It seems to me that if Americans are leaning towards the anti-capital punishment side, then we should see fewer and fewer juries handing down death sentences. \n \n And you say that most people prefer to believe that we are above childish acts of revenge. So by most you must mean the majority of Americans, right? So since the majority of Americans still support the use of capital punishment, I guess this would mean that mostAmericans do not feel that capital punishment is a childish act. \n \n Some poll numbers showing most Americans opinions about captial punishment: \n \n http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=23&did=210#FoxNews0001",

The youngest member, Randy Halprin, 23, was serving a 30-year sentence for injury to a child. \n ......\n Christmas Eve \n \n Three days after arriving in the Dallas area, the seven allegedly robbed Oshman's Super Sports USA Store in Irving, Texas. The convicts allegedly struck around closing time and, holding several employees hostage, stole $70,000 in cash and checks, at least 40 firearms, ammunition and clothing. On their way out, while they were loading their vehicle with the stolen goods, Officer Aubrey Hawkins arrived at the scene. \n \n Hawkins was shot 13 times - including six bullets in his head - and was run over by the escapees' car as they fled the scene. \n Crime scene evidence also shows that there was in excess of 20 shots and that at least five .357 magnum pistols were used. Autopsy results were able to link the wounds to at least two pistols, but the others could not be matched to weapons specifically. When the guns were later found, many were dissembled and it is unknown which convict used which pistol. \n \n Rivas later said he initially fired two warning shots at Hawkins when he wouldn't follow orders to raise his arms. \n \n He said he fired one shot to each side of Hawkins' chest, knowing that Hawkins would be wearing a bulletproof vest. Rivas said he himself was then shot at twice, and when he saw \"white\" with pain, he fired three shots at Hawkins, which he concedes could have been fatal. \n \n http://www.courttv.com/trials/texas7/background.html [/quote]\n \n\n (If a murderer is released and murders again, that has nothing to do with the death penalty, rather the sentencing laws, so doesn't contribute to the number of lives saved by the death penalty).\n \n -Wez\n\n \n Excuse me, but isn't \"the death penalty\" a sentencing law? emoticon_wow Your circular logic has gotten me dizzy. emoticon_frazzled",

   "So far, no pro death penalty posts here have given good reasons to use it. There is no proof that it scares off potential murderers in society, and no other argument even makes sense.\n \n People always talk about how \"We need to think of John (the murdered), and have them put to death for John's sake.\" The dead don't seek revenge, and revenge can be nothing but meaningless to a person who is dead. Unless, of course, you can prove that revenge does have meaning for the dead, in which case our justice system might have reason to consider it. What these people are really doing is using the dead's name in order to get their own personal revenge. Anyone who uses the dead's name like this is defaming them, and this is absolutely wrong. If you want revenge, ask for it in your own name; don't be a coward. But, if you weren't the one murdered, what right do you have to ask for revenge in your own name? You don't. The only reason you have a right to ask for punishment at all is in the name of protecting society. We punish to ensure future safety by staving off future wrongdoings (again, the death penalty is no more effective than eternity in prison).\n \n From the American people's perspective, what is just about spending more of their money putting a man to death than they would by simply removing him from society for the rest of his life? Both accomplish the same goal of total removal. If it has ever happened that a man convicted of murder was legally released, and killed yet again, one (or even a few) incident is laughable in the face of the number of innocent people put on death row. \n \n The argument that convicted murderers might break free is also a joke. Justice is not put to use by acting under the assumption that its dictates will not be followed through. Similarly, we could assume anything about anyone we ever punished at all. Were I a teacher, I could assume that the child I sent to the corner was going to leave early, and thus escort him straight to the principle's office, just to be prudent. Such reasoning allows virtually any punishment to be extended ad infinitum because the punished might fall out of line with their punishment at any time.\n \n Then there is the argument that flaws in the death penalty lay with the judiciary system, not with the actual penalty itself. While anyone can accept that a \"perfect\" judiciary system would only send real murderers to death row, even if this were the case, it does not negate the problems mentioned before. The death penalty costs the tax payers more and benefits neither the dead, nor society, in any way, and society doesn't punish in order to \"get revenge.\" (In addition, this argument can be flipped and used against the argument that prisoners might escape. \"But that's a problem with prison security!\" Or against the inmate release argument: \"But that's a problem with releasing life-in-prison muderers, not with the punishment itself if it were properly used!\")\n \n But the worst part of it all is this \"machismo\" aura that many pro-death penalty citizens try to emulate. \"They killed so and so, therefore stick it to 'em and let 'em burn! I hope he dies slow, and wets himself, too!!\" You think this is manly? The biggest laugh of the whole death penalty argument is that the whole thing is upheld by sniveling, quivering cowards who don't appear to know what it is to be a real man (or woman) in the least.",

   "So far, no pro death penalty posts here have given good reasons to use it. There is no proof that it scares off potential murderers in society, and no other argument even makes sense.\n \n People always talk about how \"We need to think of John (the murdered), and have them put to death for John's sake.\" The dead don't seek revenge, and revenge can be nothing but meaningless to a person who is dead. Unless, of course, you can prove that revenge does have meaning for the dead, in which case our justice system might have reason to consider it. What these people are really doing is using the dead's name in order to get their own personal revenge. Anyone who uses the dead's name like this is defaming them, and this is absolutely wrong. If you want revenge, ask for it in your own name; don't be a coward. But, if you weren't the one murdered, what right do you have to ask for revenge in your own name? You don't. The only reason you have a right to ask for punishment at all is in the name of protecting society. We punish to ensure future safety by staving off future wrongdoings (again, the death penalty is no more effective than eternity in prison).\n \n From the American people's perspective, what is just about spending more of their money putting a man to death than they would by simply removing him from society for the rest of his life? Both accomplish the same goal of total removal. If it has ever happened that a man convicted of murder was legally released, and killed yet again, one (or even a few) incident is laughable in the face of the number of innocent people put on death row. \n \n The argument that convicted murderers might break free is also a joke. Justice is not put to use by acting under the assumption that its dictates will not be followed through. Similarly, we could assume anything about anyone we ever punished at all. Were I a teacher, I could assume that the child I sent to the corner was going to leave early, and thus escort him straight to the principle's office, just to be prudent. Such reasoning allows virtually any punishment to be extended ad infinitum because the punished might fall out of line with their punishment at any time.\n \n Then there is the argument that flaws in the death penalty lay with the judiciary system, not with the actual penalty itself. While anyone can accept that a \"perfect\" judiciary system would only send real murderers to death row, even if this were the case, it does not negate the problems mentioned before. The death penalty costs the tax payers more and benefits neither the dead, nor society, in any way, and society doesn't punish in order to \"get revenge.\"\n \n But the worst part of it all is this \"machismo\" aura that many pro-death penalty citizens try to emulate. \"They killed so and so, therefore stick it to 'em and let 'em burn! I hope he dies slow, and wets himself, too!!\" You think this is manly? The biggest laugh of the whole death penalty argument is that the whole thing is upheld by sniveling, quivering cowards who don't appear to know what it is to be a real man (or woman) in the least.\nI doubt there will ever be any hard evidence that executions deter future criminals from committing similar crimes. I'd have as hard a time proving that as I do proving that my Elephant Repellent works. Even though I've never had elephant problems while using it, I've never had elephant problems while not using it.\n \n I suppose proof would require that we do away with the death penalty for a generation or so, then reinstate it and watch the capital crimes rates go down. I'm believing that's exactly what would happen.\n \n Knowledge of possible penalties for certain acts is likely a deterrent only for those who remain conscience of it immediately prior to the commitment to complete the act. I doubt a man who chokes his wife to death in a fit of rage stops to think that he might be executed for it, but if we categorically prohibit all executions, he will know all along that his worst prescribed punishment will include room and board. \n \n BTW, if you really think I'm a sniveling, quivering coward, let me invite you to a real duel. We'll find out whether you're afraid of death.",

   "No, we have no idea what they were doing or why they were accused, though it seems that mistaken identity is a majopr player in many of the cases, and in only a handful of cases are there any other charges ever mentioned which would imply fairly strongly that there was nothign else to charge them with (especially when considering the excellent chance of these guys coming back and suing the government for millions).\n\n \n Sueing the government - you're kidding right? It's not surprising that other charges wouldn't be mentioned since they would most likely not be close to capital offenses, (robbery/drug offenses) and if the person doing the reporting was anti-death penalty. \n \n \nWould Jim put himself in a situation where he may someday face the death penalty, wrongfully accused? That depends. Does he ever exchange angry words with anybody? Is there anybody he does not like? Anybody who does not like him? Is Jim distinctive looking enough that nobody would ever mistake him for somebody else?\n \n \n When and where he exchanges words with somebody would be important. It would benefit him greatly not to do it on a popular drug dealing corner at 2:00 AM. \n \n \nJim ha a fight with the guy next door. The lady across the street sees it. The next day, the guys shows up dead. Another guy on the block says he saw Jim leaving the guys house after hearing a shot. We are going to assume for the purpose of this that the person the guy saw was NOT Jim. Like so many others, he mis-identified somebody. After all, it was dark. \n \n Auddenyl the police have motive and an eyewitness. Jim is on his way to becoming collateral damage.\n\n \n That's a possible scenario, but if Jim's life was in perfect order in every other way, the chances of him getting the death penalty would be slim. \n \n HOW one is put to death is an important consideration. While an innocent, rap sheet or not, being put to death by government is a terrible thing, there are worse ways to die than a government lethal injection. Victims do all the time, whether slowly over a period of weeks like Terry Schivo, or a few days like a 5 year old girl that gets raped, tortured over a period of days, then slowly killed. I don't know what the ratio is for murder victims on the streets or in their own houses as opposed to mistaken government executions, but I suspect it's quite a contrast.",

So we save money, prevent executing innocents, and we prevent all future crimes by that person. Unless you really think that the death penalty is a deterrant (stats prove otherwise), than there is no case to have the death penalty rather than solitary confinement ($75,000 is a lot of money, but it's better than over $2 million). How about we just start randomly killing people? We could get the person who may kill in the future. We could save millions of lives. But we could also kill many innocent people.

That's what we need to address.\n \n\n \n\n Then there is the argument that flaws in the death penalty lay with the judiciary system, not with the actual penalty itself. While anyone can accept that a \"perfect\" judiciary system would only send real murderers to death row, even if this were the case, it does not negate the problems mentioned before. The death penalty costs the tax payers more and benefits neither the dead, nor society, in any way, and society doesn't punish in order to \"get revenge.\" (In addition, this argument can be flipped and used against the argument that prisoners might escape. \"But that's a problem with prison security!\" Or against the inmate release argument: \"But that's a problem with releasing life-in-prison muderers, not with the punishment itself if it were properly used!\")\n \n\n As one can see, the argument against the death penalty does not even require the deaths of innocent people, or a flawed judicial system, in order to be valid.",

   "What a cheap and uneducated shot. Hitler was hellbent on wiping out an entire race of people along with homosexuals and gypsies. He did not want to kill only the worthless criminal bastards that I would like to see die.\n \n\n ok, that was a little far, but try to understand what I was saying. You said we should fry these people and that oh well if we get a few innocents, it's worth it. At least we try to make sure they are guilty. Hitler killed a whole race, you are basically saying you don't mind if we kill a bunch of innocent people as long as we get guilty people as well.\n \n \n \n\n If there's any doubt about the innocence or guilt, the person should have been acquitted. I know you'll likely say \"What if they didn't actually commit the crime but were found guilty?\" Convince yourself that those found guilty are by definition GUILTY. It makes no difference that they didn't actually do the crime. They are still guilty because the jury said so. That's a mistake on the jury's part and may result in the death of someone other than the one who really did it, but the execution would still be of the party found guilty by rule of law. Collateral damage.\n \n\n Unfortunately currently in our system lawyers can make a huge difference, and 2 different jurries could find the same person in the same trial guilty and not guilty. Also, our technology increases and we are able to discover things about what has happened in the past that we couldn't when it happened.\n \n If we put them in jail, it is reversable. Yes we have taken away years off their life, and that's bad enough. But when you have the choice of killing innocents or putting them in jail for 20 years (or however long until we find out they were really innocent), I'll put them in jail. You are willing to spend more money to kill the people and have innocent people dead. That is irreversible.\n \n \n\n No more real than the victims were.\n \n\n The death penalty doesn't reverse the death of the victim. That is unfortunate but over. It can't be reversed. Solitary confinement for life is not much better of a punishment than death, sometimes even worse. It's been shown that the death penalty won't prevent any future deaths such as this and solitary confinement will keep the world safe from them.\n \n \n\n You'd rather I would trivialize the lives of the victims? ...and if you don't thinik the deaths of our soldiers was \"worth it\", you are a sick puppy.\n \n\n I never said the deaths of our soldiers wasn't worth it. But that's all well and good when you're sitting on your couch. I've never been in war, and I'm not talking about our current situation. I'm talking about any politician or non-military person saying that the deaths are worth it. Only the death penalty is even worse. Hopefully a war is helping our country, the death penalty costs our country money and doesn't help anything.\n \n \n\n I'd likely feel the same as I would had my child died needlessly as a result of a drunk driver running him down.\n \n\n right. I doubt it. I've had an aunt die because of a drunk driver. My first thoughts? I would have wanted to kill that :xcensored. But now that it's done, I know that killing another person wouldn't have helped anything and that it would be an insult to her to kill another human on top of her just in the name of vengance.\n \n \n \n\n Only if you factor in the cost of the trial and appeals. I've made a standing offer regarding batch executions. I work cheap.\n \n\n Well when we have many innocents being killed you want to cut the appeals? Interesting approach. I thought you said you valued innocent lives.\n \n \n\n Show me the stats that \"prove\" this. \n \n\n http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=12&did=167\n \n Note it has the stats on countries (we are at the top for murder rate) and it has a graph of death penalty states and non-death penalty states. There are only 2 non-death penalty states over the national average (Alaska and Michigan). There are 17 death penalty states over the national average. \"The average of murder rates per 100,000 population in 1999 among death penalty states was 5.5, whereas the average of murder rates among non-death penalty states was 3.6\".\n \n Shouldn't it be the other way around if the death penalty was really a deterrant?\n \n \n\n For one proven guilty (of the capital crimes) a fifty cent bullet will do the trick.\n \n\n I'm fine with this but as mentioned earlier most of the costs lie in the appeals, which have been shown to be necessary.\n \n \n\n Don't be completely silly here.\n \n\n If I didn't realize you were serious I would say the same to you when you call killing innocents \"collateral damage\". That's just sick.\n \n \n\n Who said it was unnecessary killing that I advocate.

   "I understood exactly what you said. What you're saying now is what you said is not what you meant. Another weasle trick used often by numerous people.\n \n\n \n OK, let me explain again. You said to fry them and oh well if we get some innocent people. Hitler was like that too. He killed the people he thought were bad, but at least he only took out the \"bad people\" and didn't accidentally get people who weren't jews, gays, gypsies, disabled, etc.\n \n I understand that what he did was horrible, and that the reasoning and feriocity is different from yours, but it is the same line of thinking, those lives don't mean anything as long as we acheive a goal (\"purifying\" Germany in his case, revenge on killers in your case). That's what I meant. I was a little upset at seeing what you wrote, so maybe that was a bit far, but that's exactly what I meant.\n \n \n\n Those are all arguments for fixing the system, not adjusting the punishment.\n \n\n I agree we need to fix the system, but ALSO at this time we need to realize the system is imperfect and that we cannot put people to death with an imperfect system. If we were 100% sure of guilt I may be more inclined to support the death penalty, although it still costs more.\n \n \n\n If the confinement did not include all the comforts of home, I might agree. But with our compassionate ACLU and bleeding hearts constantly fighting for the rights of these \"poor\" criminals, life in prison is a piece of cake, not a punishment. They need to be deprived of an enjoyable life, not pampered like innocent wayward children who were simply reacting to a bad environment.\n \n\n I completely agree with you. The minimum requirements of life should be met (shelter, food) and that's it. ESPECIALLY murderers such as this should only have the bare minimum. The only reason we're keeping them alive is it's not worth it to kill them. Just as I don't want to pay money to kill them, we shouldn't be paying money for them to receive cable TV, couches, etc. Give them a room, an old bed, and 3 cheap meals a day. We're putting them there because they can't be trusted in the outside world, and as a deterrant, it should not be fun.\n \n \n \n\n You didn't?\n \n I have a lot of respect for you but I'm sorry, when you trivialize human lives like that (it's worth these lives) it reminds me of those who talk about the deaths in our military being \"worth it\". \n \n Those are your words from a previous post. Had you not been obviously implicated I would not have concluded same.\n \n\n Please re-read that. Do I ever say that it isn't worth it? I say that those sitting back on their couches (note this includes me too) have no room to talk about how other peoples' lives are worth it. They may be worth it to me, but until it is worth risking your life for other peoples' freedoms, until you will lose a loved one for the cause you are fighting, your words don't have much weight. It's like the scene in Shrek where the king says \"many of you may die [while trying to rescue the princess from the castle who will marry me], but that's a sacrifice I am willing to make\". I think you would be of the opinion that he has no room to talk, but he could be right. It could be worth it.\n \n \n\n It's not required that you participate in a war to know that the deaths of those who fought to defend your freedom was worth it.\n \n\n I understand that but until you have experienced the loss of a loved one for our country, or risked your own life in war, your words don't have quite the weight when talking about OTHER peoples' lives being worth it.\n \n \n\n You missed my point. Death of an innocent person is no less unfortunate due to its cause.\n \n\n That is the case? Then why do you spend so much time talking about the death penalty? How many people die in murders each year? How many died on 9/11?\n \n How many die in car crashes every day. I think I heard that more people died in car crashes than in the 9/11 attacks on that day. Why aren't you fighting for car safety? Those lives are no less unfortunate. Why aren't you pushing to ban cars?\n \n \n\n I do. Collateral damage is unfortunate.\n \n\n I doubt you believe that. You have a choice. Pay more money, risk collateral damage, and not acheive anything other than raw vengence, or save the innocent people who are killed and save money. Why must you kill innocent people just to give the victim's family the satisfaction of vengance which they most likely will regret later anyway?\n \n \n\n ICBM, but I think the additional cost is concentrated in the first trial. A lot more effort is required of the defense team and the prosecutor. I'm not sure this is not a slam on the non-capital accused. It's saying that \"since you're not accused of a capital crime, we won't try as hard.\"\n \n\n I don't know what ICBM means but do you have any stats on this?\n \n \n\n As I said, collateral damage is unfortunate. Each death of innocents is unfortunate. I do not want innocents killed...at all. However, a person convicted of a capital crime is BY OUR OWN DEFINITION NOT INNOCENT.\n \n\n Then we need to work on our definitions. Innocent means they did not commit the crime. Many people are judged guilty and as more evidence shows up their status is changed to not guilty, and under the eyes of our justice system they are innocent.\n I don't know why money is such a concern.\n \n \n\n The irreversability of death is obvious. That's what makes collateral damage unfortunate.\n\n \n Yet you have the opportunity to reduce collateral damage, and you choose not to. It becomes more than collateral damage at that point, it becomes preventable damage.",

I simply is not worth it to even try. It is like trying to argue gun control. There is no logical basis for gun control and all studies on the subject have showed the same thing, that gun control does not help lower crime. The pro death penalty argument is one born of fear and ignorance and pseudo macho bravado. For god sakes, one of the death penatly supporters here challenged somebody to a DUEL right here in the thread. How much more backwards can you possibly be? Is there a better example of BS bravdo anywhere on the net? I doubt it. \n \n \n \nI completely agree with you. The minimum requirements of life should be met (shelter, food) and that's it.

We're putting them there because they can't be trusted in the outside world, and as a deterrant, it should not be fun.\n\n \n Ok, then can we assume that you are going to pay for the extra security needed to keep those people in line personally? As long as your prisoners are sitting on a couch watching TV, they are not rioting or escaping. It also offers a layer of dicipline within the prison by giving them something they can take away for misbehaving convicts. Prisoners do not get those things beacue we want to give them to them, or becuase the dirty liberals want them to have them. They get those things becuase it is cheaper to provide cable TV than it is to assign 10-15 extra guards per shift. It is cheaper to build a game room than to build every prison out of blast proof reinforced concrete walls. It is cheaper to give them a library and some games to play than it is to pay death ebnifits to gurads families when the guards are killed during riots,.\n \n Unfortunatly, prison work programs are largely a thing of the past. When they DID have those programs, they were very popular since the main problem with prison seems to be boredom. The main problem with the prison work programs tende3d to be corruption. When you are talking a federal prison, you are generally talking 1000 or more cirminals being controlled by 20-50 gurads at any one time. There is no possible way that those few guards could control that many convicts if the convicts decided in mass that they were leaving. The television, games, etc... keeps them occupied.",

   "Here's the truth about your 119 figure.\n \n http://www.prodeathpenalty.com/Innocence.htm\n \n Read this entire link. It's quite interesting and revealing of the dubious methods anti-death penalty activists will use to get their way.\n\n I've skim read parts of it. Some interesting fact twisting going on here:\n \n \" Of those 102 DPIC \"innocent\" cases, 24 have been identified by the DPIC as being from the state of Florida. The Florida Commission on Capital Cases conducted a thorough review of those 24 cases. The Commission found that 4 of those might have a credible claim of actual innocence. (15).\n \n That reveals an 83% error by the DPIC in their Florida case descriptions. If the DPIC has a consistent error rate, nationwide, that would indicate that there is evidence for claiming 17 actual innocents within their 102 innocents claim -- or 0.2% of the 7400 sentenced to death since 1973.\"\n Trusting one survey that agrees, while simply ignoring the other study.\n \n \" At least 11 of the cases were not even on death row at the time of their \"innocence\" discovery. 6 of the DPIC listed cases were not on death row when released and were prosecuted prior to 1973, in the pre Furman v Georgia (1972) era and, therefore, have no place in a modern era discussion of \"innocents\" released from death row (19).\"\n So they don't count because at the time of their proven 'innocence' they weren't oon death row? That doesn't stop them being 'innocent' while on death row.\n \n \" As Dieter and other death penalty opponents make no distinction between the actually innocent and the legally innocent, why don't they claim that over 2500 innocents have been \"exonerated\" from death row? That is the number of legally and actually innocent released from death row since 1973 (6). The answer is obvious. \"\n Why were they on death row in the first place?\n \n \" \"A defendant whose conviction is overturned by a judge must be further exonerated in one of three ways: he must be acquitted at a new trial, or the prosecutor must drop the charges against him, or a governor must grant an absolute pardon.\" (7)\n \n Dieter is consistent.\n \n None of those exoneration categories establishes, or even suggests, actual innocence.\"\n \"Acquitted\" doesn't count as \"actual innocence\"?\n \n \" Acquittal, which is a \"not guilty\" verdict, means that the state was unable to meet the necessary burden of proof, in establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It has nothing to do with establishing actual innocence. \"\n What the hell? Acquitted means \"To free or clear from a charge or accusation.\" Their definition of \"acquitted\" is \"the state was unable to meet the necessary burden of proof,\" which is of course true, but seems to forget that that not meeting the burden of proof includes not having proof.\n \n \" Furthermore, any assertion that the death penalty is not a deterrent is false. Those studies not finding for deterrence do not say it doesn't exist. Those studies finding for deterrence state that is does. A statutory challenge caused a temporary halt to executions in Texas, in 1996. The result? \"The [Texas] execution hiatus, therefore, appears to have spared few, if any, condemned prisoners while the citizens of Texas experienced a net 90 [up to 150) additional innocent lives lost to homicide. Politicians contemplating moratoriums may wish to consider the possibility that a seemingly innocuous moratorium on executions could very well come at a heavy cost.\" (22)\"\n \n The first sentence is written as a fact. This fact is based on one quoted survey. If I produce a survey that says the death penalty isn't a deterrent what ahppens then?\n \n \n \nThere's a link not to far back in this thread that lists many repeat killings by people who got out after serving time for murder. Several were murders of kind people who befriended the murderer and gave him a place to stay.\n \n http://www.prodeathpenalty.com/repeat_murder.htm\n\n Now how many of those occurred while the prisoner was either in prison or after he escaped? Those are the only relevant ones, seeing as my argument is that the death penalty should be changed to life imprisonment.\n \n \n \nThere are also instances of murderers killing other prisoners and prison guards while in prison. Do these count in your tabulation of repeat murderers?\n\n Yep.\n \n -Wez",

Third, he was sentenced to death because a jury found his crimes especially heinous, and prior to \"tookie\" becoming a dime store book shelf sensation. His \"good\" actions since his conviction should not change the sentence the jury handed down.",
