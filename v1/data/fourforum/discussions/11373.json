   "I've finished reading certain chapters from \"The Global Benefits of Eating Less Meat\" by Mark Gold and the \"2020 Global Food Outlook\" Both demonstrate how a reduction in ones meat consumption not only helps to relieve starvation in developing countries, but it is also less wasteful, and better for the environment.\n \n The 2020 Global Food Outlook notes that a decrease in demand in meat in developed countries in Europe and North America will not only create cheaper meat prices for developing countries, but it will also make the feed intended for farm animals cheaper for people in developing countries, especially Africa and Asia.\n \n In the study authored by Mark Gold, he claims that producing more farm animals for more meat is not only wasteful, but will not solve many problems because: even more land that is used or could be used for agricultural farming for people will instead be used for growing GM foods such as soybeans and maize to feed animals; most starving people today cannot even afford grains, let alone the much more expensive prices of meat; and it could possibly create stress on any health care systems due to pathogens that could contaminate meat products because they are at higher risk of fecal contamination. He proposes the best way for a developing country to establish greater overall health in its' populations is to become better self-sufficient at growing plant foods.\n \n Here are excerpts from The Global Benefits of Eating Less Meat:\n www.ciwf.org/publications/reports/The_Global_Benefits_of_Eating_Less_Meat.pdf\n \n \"...livestock farming actually wastes resources. This is because grain-fattened animals take more energy and protein from their feed than they return in the form of food for humans.\"\n \n This is something I learned in basic biology in my freshman year. A primary consumer like a cow will get 10% energy from the producer, plants, but the when the secondary consumer eats the cow, less than 1% of energy is transfered. So clearly eating lower on the food chain is significantly less wasteful.\n http://www.arcytech.org/java/population/facts_foodchain.html\n \n More:\n \"Perhaps even more crucial than the inefficient feed conversion ratios for animals products is their drain on the world's water resources. This is in a world where more than 1 billion people 'lack enough safe water to meet minimum levels of health and income'. Since livestock take a far heavier toll on water than plant foods, limiting their numbers is an obvious effective measure towards conservation of resources.\"\n \n ...And so we come to a question of most importance we must ask ourselves:\n \n \"If we in the developed world reduce our meat consumption on grounds that it might help to alleviate world hunger, would it actually make any difference to those without enough food?\n \n 'The number of malnourished children in developing countries would decline by 3.6 million children in 2020 and by 1.2 million in Sub-Sahara Africa.'\n \n 1. Even though 3.6 million lives out of a projected 129 million undernourished children is only 2.8 percent of the total, it is in itself a good enough reason to justify the reduction. \n \n 2. Why restrict the calculation only to children? Roughly 1.2 billion people live in absolute poverty, so the same 2.8 percent would relieve 33.6 million people in total.\n \n 3. Decreases in meat eating in excess of 50% would save even more lives.\"\n \n There is much more. I ask that you read the entire document if you have the time. \n \n \n The second issue is that of farming affect on the environment. I am completely new to this topic and I have not examined it with a microscope, yet, but I plan on finishing the chapters 3,4, and 5 in Mark Gold's article and also reading \"Livestock's Long Shadow\" this weekend:\n http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf\n Hopefully others more educated than I will be able to discuss this.\n \n \nThe livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution, and loss of biodiversity.\n \n In the report, senior U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization official Henning Steinfeld reports that the meat industry is \"one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems\"[3] and that \"urgent action is required to remedy the situation.\"[4]\n \n Other points the report makes are that the world's livestock industry \"generates 65 per cent of human-related nitrous oxide, which has 296 times the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of CO2\"[5] and \"that livestock are responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, a bigger share than that of transport.\"[6]\n\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock's_Long_Shadow",

   "This assumes that land is equally suited to arable and pastoral farming.\n In reality that isn't the case, upland areas are generally unsuitable for crops, whilst lowland areas are usually used for arable.\n\n This isn't assumed in the studies. Nearly 35% of all arable land used worldwide is used to feed livestock.\n \n \n\n \n Firstly, complete this sentence:\n \n If decreasing demand for meat in the western world decreases the price of meat in the developing world, increasing demand for vegetables in the western world _________ the price of vegetables in the developing world.\n \n Malnourished children aren't worried about getting meat. They can't even afford vegetables. Lower meat prices won't help them. In your own words \"most starving people today cannot even afford grains\"\n\n \n The 2020 Global Food Outlook answers this as it says that a greater demand for vegetables will correspond with higher prices of vegetables in developing countries. Many articles acknowledge that starving people cannot afford much of any of the food for sale around them, and a greater demand for meat does not necesarily mean a decrease in demand for vegetables as populations grow globally. Since increasing meat consumption is irrational because it will not feed the poor and it will do even more damage to the environment, again, the solution proposed is to support the initiative for developing nations to become more self-sufficient in growing plant foods for themselves.\n \n\n If you want to pursue this argument further and say that the western world will also purchase less vegetables, by virtue of decreased demand for animal feed, so the price of at least I dunno, maize? \n No, I wouldn't have, but since you bring it up...\nyou may, but firstly, that argument may well not fly - much of the grain going to these animals is essentially the trash left over from other production to begin with, unfit for human consumption.\n\n Nearly all the food humans eat today, even in the Western world is GM including maize, tomatoes, and soy, etc, etc. used as ingredients in products such some soymilk. Essentially everything is with the exception of \"organic\". However, as i noted above, I wouldn't make this argument because I think GM soy esecially is not very healthy for people snd GM foods tend to be more prone to bacterial infection which can make people sick. I haven't read from all sides, however.\n \n\n Secondly, even if the western world were to actually reduce the amount of grains AND meat it consumed, this would leave them with a whole bunch of money left over, which would then be diverted into other consumables, which may be more carbon intensive than the food production process. I'd bet that many american families finding themselves with an extra $10 a week in their pockets would spend it on petrol, air con, plasma tvs, cars, apartments. So the impact on carbon emissions may well be positive instead of negative.\n\n Perhaps, but as studies have noted, contributing the growing of livestock is one of top things one can do to harm the environment.\n \n \"The livestock sector is a major player [in climate change], responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions measured in CO2 equivalent. This is a higher share than transport.\"\n \n I've read that methane and nitrous oxide have greater warming potential than Co2.\n \n Furthermore, IF the government were to become involved and create an objective to reduce meat consumption in a country I'm sure the people would be aware as to why and make their choices. Living green is already a popular topic so many people who are not already aware of efficient energy use would eventually learn if this issue came to a front. \n \n\n Economic analysis of the consequences of an action means looking for what is unseen - the secondary effects that are not the goal of the action. In the end you may be right that the sum total effect would both decrease carbon emissions and and benefit the starving of the world - but that's a big may, and certainly one impossible to prove. You can try modelling it, that's what the investment banks would do, but they're still wrong half the time. The problem faced is that you're working with an interconnected multitude of equilibrium systems, not a perfect command economy where outcomes can be dictated with any degree of accuracy.\n\n I understand wht you are saying; reducing meat consumption will be supporting an initiative to feed the hungry that may not work.... However, I see no evidence that suggest continuing high meat consumption will save hungry people so from a rational view I do my part regardless of whether I'm really helping or not because I support the cause and afterall, it does reduce my negative impact on the environment, it's extremely easy to cut meat back and according to major sources, probably healthier.\n \n What I don't think is disputable is the fact that reducing meat consumption, particularly meat grown intensively, will reduce ones carbon footprint dramatically.\n \n \n POST EDIT--\n \n Adding another point to what was said by Sinjin:\n \n 4) Grass fed cows eat.... Since cows more easily digest grass because it is their natural food, grass fed cattle create less methane than the cattle raised on grains.",

Reduced demand for meat will directly reduce the world price for meat, making meat more affordable for customers in developed countries. This reduced meat demand and drop in meat prices will also cause a direct reduction in meat production in both developed and developing countries, which will reduce the demand for cereals for animal feed. Reduced demand for feedgrains will in turn cause a drop in prices of cereals, including an increase in food demand for cereals.\"\n \n Obviously these studies address if this is actually possible. Both studies acknowledge that a reduction in meat consumption will require modest levels of increased agricultural farming. \n \n Sinjin, this may answer your important question. \n \n \"What will it cost to generate the modest levels of agricultural production growth and human welfare improvement envisioned by the baseline scenario? Investment by developed countries in five key sectors - irrigation, rural roads, agricultural research, clean water provision and education - are projected to total US$579 billion between 1997 and 2020. These investments are certainly feasible.\"\n \n Studies by the FAO, WHO, and SEPA also agree with the many of the conclusions in these studies. \n \n SEPA states that acreage needed to produce food for humans will be lower as well. Your question of environmental cost is backwards. Not only is directly consuming plant based food vastly more efficient than being a secondary consumer, the efficiency of producing crops is much higher and requires less land to feed MORE people. \n \n No where have I quoted or argued to \"feed the US population nearly exclusively on vegetables\".\n \n ps: Symbiote, cows do not emit much co2 nor do they directly emit it, but after being belched out the methane combines with water to form co2 among other gases.",

   "emoticon_confused Cows do not directly emit CO2???\n Are you aware of what an animal breathes out as per normal respiration?\n\n I learned that in biology class, but it slipped by me already. Thanks for correcting me. I do not know; I've neveer thought of respiration as waste, but how much?\n \n\n The product of 35% of arable land may go towards animal feed, however this grossly oversimplifies what is going on. Are you talking exclusively about land used to produce grain for animal feed or are you including other forms of fodder for livestock?\n\n Al ot of it consists of grasses which only cattle can eat. This is also probably why agricultural research, soil cultivation and maintanence is necessary to increase the number and variety of crops which can be consumed by humans. I wonder how much of that 35% of arable land would be necessary to cultivate for plant foods if there were, say a 15% decrease per capita in meat consumption? I'm looking for that answer, let me know if you find it first.\n \n\n Further, meat is not the only product of livestock farming, which include wool, eggs, leather and dairy poducts amongst other things.\n\n That is true, a reduction in livestock populations may affect the industries that make those products as well depending on degree of reduction.\n \n\n You also have the problem of multiple land use, again glossed over.\n The land is not at maximum yeild per unit area currently, by a large percentage. If that were the case we'd be seeing massive overproduction in the EU, US and Canada.

What is promoted in these studies are not government regulated food market, but creating policies that encourage the production of organic farming, agricultural research, soil fertility and maintenece, and education among others.\n \n The SNIPH studied CAP's policy and support for the dairy industry and found that export subsidies, import duties, intervention buying, and quotas make for a surplus production of 20%. SEPA reccomends more production in agriculture and the promotion of plant consumption can result in at 4-5% decrease of chronic disease in men and women. \n \n Tax policies are a good way to influence production and creating an awareness of the health benefits are also important. \n \n I think you may have got the impression that a command economy is necessary to bring reduction in meat consumption because of the \"50%\" number I quoted. That number was used in the simulation program, but SEPA states a 10% reduction in meat as a reasonable and attainable goal by 2020 whereas another study reccomends at least a 15% reduction per capita by 2020.",

Your last post I responded to contained terms and concepts that were completely alien to me, but after doing a bit of research I posted my response anyway because afeter researching I thought I had learned just enough of what you were talking about. However, I now realize I was short-sighted in doing so because I have no roots in understanding economics, specifically I do not know much about subsidising products and I cannot continue this conversation right now. I am not in college and in high school there's no opportunity for an econimics class, but I cna look into an alternative school classes because I am interested. I need to learn the fundamentals first, so I think it will take time for me to understand all the concepts. I cannot agree or disagree any further. I gain nothing from being wrong, so perhaps you will be so kind to set me in the right direction so I can read something in my spare time?\n \n As for what you pointed out, I suppose is a contradiction of sorts. Subsidised exports to provide cheap food stuffs for poor people, yet apparently from what I read in the two studies a initally cited, the undermining of local businesses due to CAP policies is more serious. I don't see why so many high esteemed organizations reccomend reductions in meat consumption (ie:10-20%) if it weren't at all possible and more beneficial to the world's hungry. Not to say your arguments aren't valid, but it's just hard for me to know when I can't understand all the arguments from each side. Argument from authority, seems like something I'd like to appeal to, but won't. :)\n \n Thanks for not throwing condescending remarks or posting emotionally charged messages.

   "Right, EU members pay a fee via taxation to the EU. THe EU then spend this money on various projects etc. the largest of which is the Common Agricultural Policy (44% of the Total budget, 43 billion Euros in 2005). Obviously the greatest beneficiaries of this are the countries with an agriculturally based economy, ie; France, Denmark and Ireland.\n France has a militant Farmers Union which has strong influence of French Government policy, and in turn France has very strong influence in Brussels.\n By contrast the industrialised nations of Europe, Principally Germany and the UK, despite a long running campaign to reform CAP (The current agreement is to reduce it to 36% of the total budget by 2013) simply haven't put the resources needed into lobbying for substantial reform. As such France is the dominant voice on the issue.\n The stated aim of CAP could be seen as analogous to the Fair Tarde Campaign; providing a reasonable standard of living for farmers and rural commiunities. However the effect of subsidies was to allow Supermarkets to demand cheaper produce and Farmers effectively became dependent on on subsidies for survival.\n Under the original terms subsidy was paid for quantity produced, regardless of the rules of supply and demand resulting in vast \"food mountains\" of excess produce. The inherant problems have been apparent almost from the start with calls for reform starting on 21st December 1968. CAP has also been a notorious target for fraud whether that be sheep being moved around to create the impression of larger herds or non-existant olive groves.\n Another aspect of CAP was a drive for self sufficiency in Agricultural Produce, this was copied from the British move to self sufficiency after WWII so as to be proof against the threat of blockade by sea.\n In the UK this had taken the form of factory farming methods and soil improvement, as such on joining the EU British farming was vastly more efficient than continental farming. Under the effects of subsidies however this proved to be unfavourable as British produce was undercut, in particular by Danish Pork. The Danes funded an intensive advertising campaign for Bacon in Britain thoughout the '80s and '90s.\n The EU is strongly protectionist and discourages imports of produce either by imposing tariffs or quotas, infamous examples being South American bananas which were forced out by subsidised bananas from French Carribean colonies.\n The UK had a number of trade agreements with Commonwealth countires including New Zealand. The French via the EU, forced Britain to abandon the treaty, in particular New Zealand butter which the French wanted to displace as the market leader.\n The EU still produces considerable excess which is shipped to developing countries undercutting local produce and putting farmers in developing countries out of business.\n Developing Countries as a result often are not self sufficient in terms of food, though are increasingly reliant on exports of Cash-Crops such as coffee and cocoa. Sugar is another product subject to CAP subsidy, it can be produced from sugar beet in Europe and thus subsidised though this is inefficient compared to sugar cane production in the tropics.\n \n As europe is more than self sufficient for produce it is a NET exporter rather than a NET importer of produce; ie, it ships more out than it ships in.\n \n http://www.openeurope.org.uk/media-centre/article.aspx?newsid=1759\n http://www.civitas.org.uk/eufacts/FSPOL/AG3.htm\n http://www.eu2005.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1079979842403\n http://resurgence.org/magazine/article477-REFORMING-THE-COMMON-AGRICULTURAL-POLICY.html",

   "I understand a bit more of how CAP operates. You said that in the original terms, subsidies were paid regardless of supply and demand, and I have one question: what changed in CAP to have supply and demand have more influence on subsidies paid for product quantity? \n \n Getting back to what you said earlier about government policies set to reduce meat consumption, I gather that the consumer is a very important part of these plans. So, if these policies were made is it also be necessary to have the average consumer also take notice and agree with the benefits?",

   "The driving force behind the reforms is the expansion of the EU into Eastern Europe and the former Communist States. These have agricultural systems that belong in the medieval period and were subsidy to be applied to them as it had been before the fall of the Berlin Wall they would swallow the EU budget whole and the main beneficiaries of CAP would become NET contributers.\n It still isn't entirely based on supply and demand leading to vast wastage in certain areas. However now it contains strong environmental concerns with subsidy paid for \"Set-aside\" ie, harvesting nothing and leaving the fields to grow wild.\n Subsidy rates change on a yearly basis to encourage farmers to cover shortfalls, eg. subsidy was increased for Oil Seed Rape resulting in large numbers of farms switching to that crop.\n \n The consumer is the \"Holy Grail\" of advertisers, I work with vulnerable adults we have people coming in to give them specific demonstrations of government food advice. For about a month after, the clients will mention the advice and take it if you shove the advised diet under their noses and offer it for free.\n Beyond that they don't do anything different. As such I would view the majority of campaigns as an utter waste of money.\n The Organic, Free Range and sustainable fishing campaigns have had far greater effect because they appeal to the consumers more on the \"Cute animal\" side than anything else. \"Five A Day\" certainly doesn't do that.\n http://www.5aday.nhs.uk/topTips/default.html\n There are \"British/Local produce\" campaigns being run, mostly by private companies - Silver Spoon, Morissons etc. which will likely have effect because they essentially give the consumer what they wanted in the first place. Farmers Markets work on roughly the same basis.\n The Fair Trade campaign has also had good success in Britain.\n http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/\n These concentrate on consumers with higher incomes who have more choice in what they can afford. Those on lower incomes tend to be swayed by BOGOF (Buy One Get One Free) style campaigns, essentially relying on the perception that they are getting more than they are paying for, even if that isn't the case.",

   "Bad, bad, bad. :( \n \n 1) Reducing meat consumption will create a change towards more agricultural farming which is more sustainable for humans and the environment.\n \n 1) Some, perhaps all \"Livestock feed\" is actually edible for humans; GM maize is regularly consumed in the US and Mexico.\n \n 2) One does not have to consume those foods as there are thousands of plant foods that can be eaten.\n\n \n \n Yep when about 99.99% of a cows diet is grass...I guess we should be eating that instead. \n \n It is hard to urinate in one corner of the toilet. If all ground that is being used for livestock is \"wonderfully transformed\" into grain production there will be many many wild species that will go extinct due to lack of uncultivated land.",
