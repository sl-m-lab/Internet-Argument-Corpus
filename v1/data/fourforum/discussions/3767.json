   "I used to be a die-hard creationist. When I went to school, I used to roll my eyes at the Evolutionary theory and filter out all that was said about it, denying all the proof science had to back up it's claims that we came about by evolution. I used to be just like all other good Christians, and I thought all of my views were right and infallible, and that science was completly wrong.\n \n Then I started to grow up, and I started to listen to what science had to say about how we came about. As time went on, I started to accept the views of the scientists, and so then I started to mold my own beliefs of a deity around my new-found belief that Evolution is a viable way that humanity could have came about.\n \n Personally, I like to believe that there is a God or a creator of some type, because I still cling in someways to my childhood beliefs. However, over time, my faith in religion dies more and more, and science begins to consume my mind. There's too much in the bible that angers me to really accept it as 100% true, because if it is as the bible has said, then God hates all of us, and he's only holding a grudge against humanity for not being the sheep he wanted us to be. He wanted us to be his 'pets', so to speak.\n \n I cannot bring myself to believe that the words of the bible were divine in origin. When you think about it, the only people who could read back when religions began proliferating the world were royalty and clergymen, so the laws they wrote were made to protect the kingdoms and the churches, and to keep the populace at their mercy. From this perspective, religion starts to look more like a tool of control used to facilitate those who were educated enough to understand it and powerful enough to control it, rather than the liberating words of a benevolent, divine power.\n \n There is so much proof that Evolution is plausable. But then again, who's to say that a creator didn't use Evolution as the means of creating life? Why would a creator spend so much time creating each individual lifeform on the planet? There are so many possiblities for how we came about, so who's to say which ones are correct and which ones aren't?\n \n For those of you who are still clinging to your faith in Religion, keep in mind religion itself has throughout the course of human history been used to commit horrible atrocities, has been responsible for holding back free will, and held back intellecual advancment ever since it was first concieved. Be sure your beliefs coincide with your own logic rather than an emotional attatchment to your original beliefs. \n \n If religion is correct, then every human on the face of the earth is going to Hell...\n \n ... and I'll be first in line.",

(Pay to get sins forgiven, ...)\n \n And just like I read in another post, where it said that the Bible is completely written by HUMANS, not by God... people might have visions where God speaks to them and shows his word, and it might be true that there was a guy called Jesus. But who can prove me that he really IS the son of God? What if he was just a \"crazy\" preacher who had thought about many things in life. Then he finally thinks he is God's son und that stuff... Finally he dies in Martyrum so that his name will be carried on throughout history.\n \n And if God is so allmighty, why doesn't he just give a proof for everyone... Most people who really think can't just live a life in faith and belief...\n \n \n \n\n There is so much proof that Evolution is plausable. But then again, who's to say that a creator didn't use Evolution as the means of creating life? Why would a creator spend so much time creating each individual lifeform on the planet? There are so many possiblities for how we came about, so who's to say which ones are correct and which ones aren't?\n \n\n That is right, too. And I completely agree that there might be a creator, there might be a God who created all there is...\n \n But I can't believe the details in the Bible, that talk of Divine Creation and that stuff... Why can't it be true, that a God created the \"system\"... It is completely possible that a God created the whole stuff with DNA, cells, and change of things (Evolution)...\n \n I just can't believe the Bible because it's been abused for many years and it's still only a book written by Human...\n \n \n \n \n\n If religion is correct, then every human on the face of the earth is going to Hell...\n \n ... and I'll be first in line.\n\n \n And I also agree in that point. If there really is a God and Christianity is completely right and everyone who doesn't believe in it will go to hell, the so be it...\n \n Let's go there, I am not afraid...\n \n AMEN (so be it)",

Scientists and teachers of science prefer to limit what is taught in science classes to science - you know, theories of science. Things like the theory of gravity, the theory of light, or atomic theory in physics. In geology they teach the theory of plate tectonics. In biology sciene teachers teach the theory of evolution. It is a scientific theory. Creationism isn't. Creationism is religious dogma. The courts in the U.S. have agreed with this view in all cases over the past 40 years or so.\n \nthey're both only theories... (and some schools even offer classes that talk about christian religion and Divine Creation)\n\n Perhaps if you devoted enough effort to learning what you were talking about. For example, try to learn the meaning that is assigned to the term theory by scientists. It doesn't mean a wild guess. In science, a theory is as good as it gets. There is no such thing as a theory of creationism. It is religious dogma that is not based on observations, predictions and experimentation. A scientific theory is. A scientific theory has been tested and found to correctly explain the data. A theory is considered correct until such time as it is demonstrated that it is incorrect.\n \n Creationism cannot be tested and is therefore not a theory. In fact, most versions of creationism (flat earth, geocentric, and young earth creationism) have been demonstrated to be incorrect. It doesn't matter how many people believe them, they should not be presented as science in science classes.\n \n Some schools that offer classes to talk about Christian religion and Divine Creation do so as elective classes, usually as part of classes of comparative religion or classes on mythology.",

In fact, it has been shown to be correct over and over again. In fact, even creationists accept evolution because they have difficulty in cramming millions of species on an ark.

That's why biologists actually regard it as fact. Other theories, like the various theories of gravity, aren't as secure and are all pretty shakey, where current work is an effort to resolve the theory of gravity of the very large (general relativity) with the theory of gravity of the very small (quantum mechanics).\n \nOr can you show me the DEFINITE proof that Evolution is wrong...

My intent was to indicate that \"widely accepted\" isn't relevant if you mean accepted by the general population.

I always heard from my mother that I should wear a sweater or a jacket on a cold day or I would catch a cold. This is still \"widely believed\" by much of the general population of this country. It isn't true. Way back in the 1940s the Army did some experiments. First they isolated some soldiers for a period of time to make sure that none had a cold. Then they had them stand in ice water in their skivvies, poured buckets of ice water over them while fans blew on them until their teeth chattered. They were volunteers, by the way. None caught cold. The Army then took another isolated group without colds. They were kept at a comfortable tempature. One individual with a cold was then introduced to the group. Everyone in this control group caught cold.\n \n Should we teach children that if they exposed to cold that they will catch cold because it is widely accepted? Nonsense. A cold is caused by one of several viruses. Should we teach children that the earth is 6,000 years old because it is widely accepted? Utter nonsense. We teach science, not widely accepted mythology.\n \n I think we actually agree and were talking past each other.",

I thought this was a free world.  \n \n You say scientists know evolution isn't 100% absoultute truth like it means something! Nothing in science is 100% absolute truth! Do you question that the earth orbits the sun, after all, it's only a theory! Do you question electricity, after all it's only a theory! Do you question germs cause diseae, after all it's only a theory! \n When theories are considered valid, even though they are not 100% true, practical applications can then be based on them. If the theory was 100% false, these practical applications would not work. But the electromagnetic theory allows us to harness and use electricity, the germ theory allows us to treat and cure diseases, the geologic model of the earth allows us to determine the earth is roughly 4.5 billion years old, so we can locate oil fields and coal deposits. The theory of evolution allows us to successfuly breed new strains of plants and animals and is a major component of modern medicine. If these theories were wrong, we couldn't do these things but since we can, they must have a high degree of validity. \n Now, I have admitted that there could be other possiblities, remote as they may be. But since, according to you, they aren't logical, they have no practical applications, they are essentially useless. If you require no evidence to support your \"possiblities\", then, of course, everything is possible. What your baseless possiblities boil down to is an end to progress, after all, what can we learn from \"Goddidit\". \n \n Everything in life is not logical. \n \n So far, everything in nature has been logical.\n \n There, Heavenbound, someone has admitted that there are other possiblities beside those proposed by science, the problem is when there is no requirement that these possiblities be logical or there is no evidence to support them, they are worthless.
