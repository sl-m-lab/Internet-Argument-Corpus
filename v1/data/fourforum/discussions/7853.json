I have begun to seek more places in the suburbs and those within city limits which do not adhere to the ban. My favorite bar is within city limits and most patrons keep an eye out for anyone approaching the bar with a clipboard or who looks \"official\" and warns everyone. To date, they have been busted thrice, each time with the bartender receiving a fine. The bar also provides Altoid cans as ashtrays which can be conveniantly shut if someone from the health department happens to enter. Other area bars also call around if they spot the health inspector.

   " Well ...I hate to break this to you but the reason this is being fought for is based on health issues,.. You know,.. \"second hand smoke causes cancer \" and all that !! Please don't tell me you think cars don't creat the exact same problems.\nThe issue isn't entirely in the problem they cause - beleive me as soon as you do a biological degree of somekind you realise that practically everything causes cancer to some degree (even bacon!). However the presence of cars is far more important to our way of life and has a net benefit overall (allowing me to travel to find better jobs, benefits from education etc), if we were to address this problem we need to find some way of solving it without just removing cars themselves. \n \n \n \n AHHH .. I understand now .. as long as it doesn't affect me ( I don't smoke ) it's ok to do.\n Welcome to democracy! I don't mind, and think its a good idea overall but then I also lean toward the socialist end of the spectrum so enjoy meddling. Your personal freedoms are there for my own amusement;)\n As long as it has the stats to prove it anyway, which sort of seems to put me more toward the middle again (or so I pretend). \n Despite this, its a lot easier to make anti-smoking legislation than anti-car stuff. If I can take one factor away from lung cancer cases then it will reduce the number of people suffering (and in my case using up NHS funds) by a few percent. I don't think you would argue against it being better for people to not take up smoking than to do so - if no one smoked would the world really be a worse place? \n \n \n \n Well not exactly .. if we revert to the middle ages and give up cars we will have to live with second hand smoke from our fires that keep us from freezing. ( I don't know how our species survived this terrible fate and allowed us to rise to the top of the food chain considering the undisputable effects of second hand smoke ) And we would have animal dung on the streets again. Not pleasent. These would be \" serious issues \" indeed.\nI'm thinking more the lack of communication, a lot of the things we take for granted in the 21st century are based of transport by petrol engines. Just because something is beneficial from a previous state of affairs (i.e inventing cars when people smoke) doesn't mean that they will automatically be best (dman QWERTY keyboards are an example of something like this which we can't really change - hence are stuck with a design that was orignally thought up to make typing inefficient)\n \n \n \n Well then why not support something that would produce a cigarette that doesn't put out \" harmfull exhausts \" ? Probably because you don't smoke, and your opposed to it, and it is more convenient for you to make rules banning it, because you don't do it, and you don't think anyone else should.\n Genius, you want to help raise the captial for it I will join you in a shot. If you can add some nicotene to a smokable product that contains a net amount of antioxidants and vitamins we can continue this debate from the jazusis on our private jets, via satellite phone from our seperate islands. If you could make smoking healthier then you are a multi-billionaire. \n Hmm, I might actually have a serious think about this.\n \n \n \n Can't you just go to another bar or something ?? \n \nAs I said, go to a clothed beach, not to mention its the employees most of this legislation cares about \n \n \n \n \n It seems you are about to succeed!\n \nSet yourself the right standards and you can't fail, even if you end up failing ;)",

While an action may make your life easier, harming another in the process is not an option. It's like that saying: Your right to swing your fist ends at my nose. I don't care if someone wants to smoke in their own house, or when they are outdoors...but I can't stand eating my meal while sitting close to someone who was smoking. Even when I was a smoker I hated it. My wife never smoked, so when I did, I went outside. Obviously not out of concern for my health, but out of concern for her health. \n \n And yes, you may have a point about cars causing cancer, but I usually do not bring my car with me into a restaurant, sit it on top of the table in a confined space, and leave it running so everyone can get a good whiff of my exhaust...do you? \n \n This whole issue is all about respect.
