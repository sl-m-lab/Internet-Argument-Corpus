   "Questions concerning Sotomayor's views on Roe V Wade, and other (details details) regarding women's right to choose:\n \n The New York Times < Log In\n \n On this, pro-choicers and anti-choicers seem to agree on one point. The questions should be answered. The USSC is not the time to play Holy Mysticism -- what will the Great Enlightened Robed Ones do .... ?\n \n I think it's worth adding, as a pro-choicer and former Clinton supporter who voted for Obama in the general, that Nancy Keenan should be on the figurative chopping block for this one. Seeing as she threw NARAL's national leadership so unwaveringly behind him, causing so many women so much angst, and there is NO question what kind of judicial thinkers -- on this matter -- would step in under a Clinton presidency.",

   "Following that Times article raising questions. Now the Washington Post prints an article describing the administration's attempt to quell any pro-choice concerns. \n \n washingtonpost.com\n \n The key point, here, I think, is President Obama's background as a Constitutional scholar, and his conversation with Sotomayor on her interpretation of the Constitution.\n \n Another point, important to me, just the background of various women Senators who supported Hillary Clinton, rather than Nancy Keenan. Who will be speaking with Sotomayor privately.\n \n Though the entire process is much too shrouded in secrecy, with irrational mystical overtones, for my Democratic tastes. Whatever party is getting their point person in.\n \n I thought it was entirely inappropriate when Roberts didn't answer questions on Roe, either.",

   "What do you mean by that (base that on - i.e. Constitution just a suggestion.) Why don't you support her nomination? \n \n I haven't followed that other story you mention enough to form an opinion. \n \n I think the court has too many men, and they should appoint women for at least the next few times around. There are plenty of qualified women to choose from.\n \n I also think it's great if there's a first Latina judge, of Puerto Rican heritage, and from humble roots. Her educational background is, of course, unchallengeable.\n \n I'm not a religious person, and as I believe in bench diversity \"up there\" in the lofty rafters of judicial thought, I am finding the High Court RCC heritage heavy. (I don't think it's a plot or anything -- as anti-Semites would assuredly think if as many justices were Jewish, instead -- but I think there should be a fairer representation of the American public's views in that respect, too.)\n \n That being said and done, there's very little discussion, if any, about her judicial views, though people and organizations whose record on issues I respect seem to be supporting her nomination.\n \n I would like to see more journalism on that subject. One article in a non-descript publication mentioned that she would be the first judge with a background on the internet. Amazing, the reporter read her opinions and described and discussed them.\n \n I would like a more open and informative process.",

It takes a lot before I call someone a racist or query them about it. For example, I once even defended George Bush in that regard, and as I am sure you can infer, I am not a fan of his record. And I have challenged people on both the left and the right with questions as to their biases.\n \n I have not yet seen an argument based on evidence that convinces me Sotomayor is racist. \n \n Your blanket assertion, here, certainly doesn't either.\n \n I actually looked up the lecture, and read it, and linked it here, finding that her remarks were taken out of context. I invited anyone reading here, to discuss with me, after reading the entire lecture, how her views were demonstrated as racist.\n \n No one has been able to meet the challenge.\n \n Unlike yourself, I do not assume people are racists because \"the left\" or \"the right\" (as in your case) has told me they are. \n \n If you cannot show me how she is, then I see no reason to think the worst of her character.\n \n It just reflects on the character of the people who think they can call her a racist without even having to back it up.\n \n \nNotice that the left is the side that plays the race card before the right ever does.

   "How is that NOT racist in any context?\n\n \n I have not taken a position as to either her being racist or not being racist. I simply assert that a case for her \"being racist\" has not been established.\n \n You provide me an isolated statement and assert the case for her being racist. How is it racist? \n \n Here, below, is just some of the context of what she said, from the link I provided in my earlier post (page five). I understand her as speaking about her understanding of discrimination, as a Latina woman, and the related need for Latinas and women on the bench. She is speaking at UC Berkeley School of Law in a Judge Mario G. Olmos Memorial Lecture in 2001; the lecture published in a law journal issue on \"Raising the Bar: Latino and Latina Presence in the Judiciary and the Struggle for Representation.\"\n \n Obviously, as you read, her audience includes young people of all backgrounds whom she wishes to inspire to more sensitivity and understanding of discrimination.\n \n It could perhaps be seen as awkwardly worded, but I think her intent is to communicate a desire for people of all backgrounds to live up to the best of what their experiences have given them -- their ability to be wisely informed and thus guided; their unique experience based insights.\n \n And, she wishes minorities and women to know that they have something very valuable to contribute, based on their experiences as minorities or women.\n \n \n ----------------\n \n In our private conversations, Judge Cedarbaum has pointed out to me that seminal decisions in race and sex discrimination cases have come from Supreme Courts composed exclusively of white males. I agree that this is significant but I also choose to emphasize that the people who argued those cases before the Supreme Court which changed the legal landscape ultimately were largely people of color and women. I recall that Justice Thurgood Marshall, Judge Connie Baker Motley, the first black woman appointed to the federal bench, and others of the NAACP argued Brown v. Board of Education. Similarly, Justice Ginsburg, with other women attorneys, was instrumental in advocating and convincing the Court that equality of work required equality in terms and conditions of employment.\n \n Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences, a possibility I abhor less or discount less than my colleague Judge Cedarbaum, our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging. Justice O'Connor has often been cited as saying that a wise old man and wise old woman will reach the same conclusion in deciding cases. I am not so sure Justice O'Connor is the author of that line since Professor Resnik attributes that line to Supreme Court Justice Coyle. I am also not so sure that I agree with the statement. First, as Professor Martha Minnow has noted, there can never be a universal definition of wise. Second, I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.\n \n Let us not forget that wise men like Oliver Wendell Holmes and Justice Cardozo voted on cases which upheld both sex and race discrimination in our society. Until 1972, no Supreme Court case ever upheld the claim of a woman in a gender discrimination case. I, like Professor Carter, believe that we should not be so myopic as to believe that others of different experiences or backgrounds are incapable of understanding the values and needs of people from a different group. Many are so capable. As Judge Cedarbaum pointed out to me, nine white men on the Supreme Court in the past have done so on many occasions and on many issues including Brown.\n \n However, to understand takes time and effort, something that not all people are willing to give. For others, their experiences limit their ability to understand the experiences of others. Other simply do not care. Hence, one must accept the proposition that a difference there will be by the presence of women and people of color on the bench. Personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see. My hope is that I will take the good from my experiences and extrapolate them further into areas with which I am unfamiliar. I simply do not know exactly what that difference will be in my judging. But I accept there will be some based on my gender and my Latina heritage.\n \n I also hope that by raising the question today of what difference having more Latinos and Latinas on the bench will make will start your own evaluation. For people of color and women lawyers, what does and should being an ethnic minority mean in your lawyering? For men lawyers, what areas in your experiences and attitudes do you need to work on to make you capable of reaching those great moments of enlightenment which other men in different circumstances have been able to reach. For all of us, how do change the facts that in every task force study of gender and race bias in the courts, women and people of color, lawyers and judges alike, report in significantly higher percentages than white men that their gender and race has shaped their careers, from hiring, retention to promotion and that a statistically significant number of women and minority lawyers and judges, both alike, have experienced bias in the courtroom?\n \n The New York Times < Log In\n \n -----------------------\n -----------------------",
