I'm not an expert on the topic of child psychology and so on.\n \n However, I have some familiarty with history and cultural diversity.

   "Talking about child molestation/rape is one thing.\n \n That aside, even with consensual plans, wouldn't it be better to wait until they are ready to become a parent? Teenagers wind up doing this without even being ready for it. Even with all the precautions (like using a condom,) it's not prevented 100% of the time. (I don't think anyone has brought this up yet.) Besides pregnancies, there are other risk factors that could come from it like STD's (is this about multiple people or one person that sleeps with the kid.)

Arguing that some primative cultures allow (or even promote) marriage in the early teens has no bearing on the Western world. It is just an attempt to cloud the issue. In primative societies, the life expectancy is much lower as well, so there are many social, economic and familial factors that aren't present in the West.\n On a personal note, if my 13 year old daughter had sex with an adult, he had better be able to outrun a speeding bullet. emoticon_xkill \n \n\n In this context, I cannot automatically brand the efforts of those groups as inherently objectionable.

Just because someone can physically do something doesn't mean that they should. People are physically able to drive a car at the age of 5 or 6, but they lack the mental discipline to make good choices at that age and would be dangerous drivers. The same can be said for engaging in sex at the onset of puberty. A young mind isn't fully developed; consequences of unsafe behavior isn't known or, if it is, it's overcome by undisciplined, impulsive action. The basic sense of responsibility isn't something that is fully-developed ahead of the body's development. There is often quite a lag time present.",

   "Limiting a minor's capability (I'm not sure of the english legal term, the slovenian term would be translated as business capability) is done in the interest of the minpor to protect the minor from potential harm. However, the minor's decisions are not automatically null and void, but rather can be annuled later or approved by the legal guardian. At least, such is our law. \n \n As seen above, the issue is not as simple as presented. But even that aside, don't you feel that the logic of two immatures being more acceptable than of an immature and a mature?\n \n Or, to ask a more pointed question, can a minor not consciously decide to get a vibrator? Or some magazines to enjoy in the company of miss Palm emoticon_xangel ? Think carefully, it's a good question because it nicely focuses on the issue of pure sex, not the harmful side effect.\n \n \nI don't think that you can make such a broad sweeping statement.\n \n We all know from the context implies it is limited to sexuality. Taking that into account, why do you feel it is too broad?\n \n \nThat said, when an adult has sex with a minor, there's an underlying belief that coersion of some sort was used and we're appalled by it. With kids, we don't usually think that the young male has the same level of experience necessary to act coersively.\n\n Quite an accurate description of the state of things. But underlying beliefs are not rational, are they? Just look at how automatically you switched to man vs. girl mode, forgetting the opposite situation. I remember my youth, and I tell you that there certainly would have been many (theoretical, unfortinately) situations where I would have consented with all my heart, and I doubt it would have harmed me. Benefitted, more likely. And I sure as hell know I was not alone in that sentiment... Now, would you argue the opposite situation is impossible? I'm not quite sure. \n \n While I'm not in that ageframe anymore, reading youth forums... (OK, just interesting bits brought to my attention when a youth who naturally reads such silly forums brings them to a forum of my choosing, like a gaming forum or similar, but I think the picture I get is good enough for this debate), cases of very young girls, the ones just becoming sexually active, showing interest in older men, much older men, are not rare. In such a case, I can hardly see the will of the minor being violated if such a liaison were to be realised and consummated. Experience and maturity are attractive, remember.\n \n \n \n It all boils down to the question of whether the assumption of foul play that has been pointed out so many times actually holds or holds strong enough to warrant security buffer zones. But at least one should think about it rationally and not under pressure of millions thinking with their guts.\n \n And no, I have never protected a woman when being hit on in a bar. However, that's because I don't drink much, which makes bars terminally boring to me, which of course means I don't frequent them (or even rare them...). But I do remember shocking my entire class when, on the 8th year conclusion outing to a spa, I kind of took the wrong side in the traditional \"boys dunking girls\" activities and instead defended the girls, which was a lot of fun, since I could take on several boys at once, would that count? No, I guess not. \n \n But then, don't you recognize that the nature and level of protection is significantly different in the cases? In one, I expect holding people and taking them outside, by a minimum of force, probably, though I'm not quite sure, is what you had in mind. How come the mere thought of the other situation makes your index finger twitch? Don't you think that's a sign of overreaction?",

   "I have just read this on another forum:\n \"A number of modern psychologists have begun scientifically studying pedophilia and a number of them have released papers that say that the assumption that children are harmed from sexuality is false. They argue that many children have positive memories of their childhood sexual incident. They believe that pedophilia should be normalized in society so that sex between an adult and child is like a child getting his or her first injection. It might be confusing and hurt but the childlove advocates claim it is beneficial for them in the future because as humans they are sexual beings and thus need to learn. Pedophile advocates are using the Internet to spread their ideas.\"\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childlove_movement\n Opinions (!?!)\n\n 0) Note the language of the quote...\n \"A number of...\"\n \"They argue...\"\n \"...many children have positive memories ...\"\n Repeatedly, vague references are made but NO actual substantiation of the claims are made. If real, they should be able to specify WHICH psychologists have said this, or what percentage. If real, they should be able to specify HOW MANY children (or what percentage) of children have had these supposedly \"positive\" memories. What studies have supposedly substantiated these claims?\n \n 1) Don't quote anything by \"wikipedia\" for a controversial subject that doesn't include citations.\n The item you quoted here is already gone. Wikipedia is open for public alteration, and thus any NAMBLA member can post anything they like on the subject. Somebody will eventually find and correct it, but until then, the lie stays up.\n \n 2) The whole \"getting his or her first injection\" analogy would be laughable if it weren't being applied to such a serious topic. An injection typically innoculates a child or helps them fight an illness. Makes them stronger medically. And it is proven by research.\n Where is the proof of these claims made here?\n How about a hypothetical scenario for the pedophiles subscribing to this notion? When the child reaches 25 or 30, when this \"benefit\" should have kicked in by then, how about we take the pedophile into a room where the person who was the previously \"injected\" child is waiting with a weapon chosen by that person.\n Give them 15 to 30 minutes alone. I'm sure the child you \"injected\" will just thank you, right?\n \n And maybe we can sell the whole issue to you on the idea that it will be your \"injection\", and in 10 to 20 years you can get back to us on whether or not it was theraputic for you...\n \n 3) \"Pedophile advocates are using the Internet to spread their ideas\"???\n Has ANYBODY here seen this?\n The only thing I can think of along these lines is \"pedophile advocates\" finding pedophile victims in chat rooms so they can later rape them...",

   "The recidivism rate for executed criminals is exactly 0.00000. emoticon_xgood\n\n The recidivism rate for an aborted child is also 0.000000\n \n \nThe recidivism rate for executed criminals is exactly 0.00000. emoticon_xgood\n\n The recidivism rate for an aborted child is also exactly 0.000000 ...\n \n The following is from the book \"Freakonomics\" by Steven Levitt: \n \n \n Perhaps the most dramatic effect of legalized abortion, however, and one that would take years to reveal itself, was its impact on crime. In the early 1990s, just as the first cohort of children born after Roev. Wade was hitting its late teen years-the years during which young men enter their criminal prime-the rate of crime began to fall. What this cohort was missing, of course, were the children who stood the greatest chance of becoming criminals. And the crime rate continued to fall as an entire generation came of age minus the children whose mothers had not wanted to bring a child into the world. Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness; unwantedness leads to high crime; legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime. \n \n This theory is bound to provoke a variety of reactions, ranging from disbelief to revulsion, and a variety of objections, ranging from the quotidian to the moral. The likeliest first objection is the most straightforward one: is the theory true? Perhaps abortion and crime are merely correlated and not causal. \n \n It may be more comforting to believe what the newspapers say, that the drop in crime was due to brilliant policing and clever gun control and a surging economy. We have evolved with a tendency to link causality to things we can touch or feel, not to some distant or difficult phenomenon. We believe especially in near-term causes: a snake bites your friend, he screams with pain, and he dies. The snakebite, you conclude, must have killed him. Most of the time, such a reckoning is correct. But when it comes to cause and effect, there is often a trap in such open-and-shut thinking. We smirk now when we think of ancient cultures that embraced faulty causes-the warriors who believed, for instance, that it was their raping of a virgin that brought them victory on the battlefield. But we too \n embrace faulty causes, usually at the urging of an expert proclaiming a truth in which he has a vested interest. \n \n How, then, can we tell if the abortion-crime link is a case of causality rather than simply correlation? \n \n One way to test the effect of abortion on crime would be to measure crime data in the five states where abortion was made legal before the Supreme Court extended abortion rights to the rest of the country. In New York, California, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii, a woman had been able to obtain a legal abortion for at least two years before Roe v. Wade. And indeed, those early-legalizing states saw crime begin to fall earlier than the other forty-five states and the District of Columbia. Between 1988 and 1994, violent crime in the early-legalizing states fell 13 percent compared to the other states; between 1994 and 1997, their murder rates fell 23 percent more than those of the other states. \n \n But what if those early legalizers simply got lucky? What else might we look for in the data to establish an abortion-crime link? \n \n One factor to look for would be a correlation between each state's abortion rate and its crime rate. Sure enough, the states with the highest abortion rates in the 1970s experienced the greatest crime drops in the 1990s, while states with low abortion rates experienced smaller crime drops. (This correlation exists even when controlling for a variety of factors that influence crime: a state's level of incarceration, number of police, and its economic situation.) Since 1985, states with high abortion rates have experienced a roughly 30 percent drop in crime relative to low-abortion states. (New York City had high abortion rates and lay within an early-legalizing state, a pair of facts that further dampen the claim that innovative policing caused the crime drop.) Moreover, there was no link between a given state's abortion rate and its crime rate before the late 1980s-when the \n first cohort affected by legalized abortion was reaching its criminal prime-which is yet another indication that Roe v. Wade was indeed the event that tipped the crime scale. \n \n There are even more correlations, positive and negative, that shore up the abortion-crime link. In states with high abortion rates, the entire decline in crime was among the post-Roe cohort as opposed to older criminals. Also, studies of Australia and Canada have since established a similar link between legalized abortion and crime. And the post-Roe cohort was not only missing thousands of young male criminals but also thousands of single, teenage mothers-for many of the aborted baby girls would have been the children most likely to replicate their own mothers' tendencies. \n \n To discover that abortion was one of the greatest crime-lowering factors in American history is, needless to say, jarring. It feels less Darwinian than Swiftian; it calls to mind a long ago dart attributed to G. K. Chesterton: when there aren't enough hats to go around, the problem isn't solved by lopping off some heads. The crime drop was, in the language of economists, an \"unintended benefit\" of legalized abortion. But one need not oppose abortion on moral or religious grounds to feel shaken by the notion of a private sadness being converted into a public good.",

   "I think we have strayed far from the original topic. This thread is about paedophilia, or more precisely paedophile activists, as well as psychologists who question whether or not sex between minors and adults is harmful. This eventually led to suggesions about the death sentence, pre-framing, regional statistics, homosexuality, perversions and so forth.\n \n Returning to the topic, the word paedophilia and paedophile activism are two terms with very wide ranges of meanings.\n \n The word \"paedophile\" is used by the common public to define anything from an adult with sexual/erotic fantasies about prepubescent children, to an adult (of any age) who has commited the legal crime of having sexual relations with someone below the age of consent...to a serial child rapist/kidnapper/murderer\n This has led to a number of very dramatic opinions concerning paedophilia\n \n The initial definition of the word paedophile is an adult or late adolescent who has either sexual feelings or erotic fantasies primarilly or exclusively towards prepubescent children (usually 12 or younger). In other words, it is an adult who is sexually aroused by the thoughts of or in the presence of children. \n \n Initially, this doesn't even begin to determine whether or not that individual is going to harm or even attempt to harm a child, and there are many paedophiles who do not act on these urges or break the law in any other way. There is a whole world of difference between desiring and intending, let alone acting. \n Unfortunately, as we all know, there are those who do decide to act on these urges, sometimes in very violent ways. However, is it necessary or even logical to put all these individuals under one name? \n \n This leads to the second term used: paedophile activists. Another term with a wide range of variations...\n \n The \"moderate\" paedophile activists are those who have not broken the law and wish not to be viewed in the same light as those who rape children and adolescents. They wish to have the ability find legal ways of coping with their \"attraction\" in society without being automatically labelled as murderers...\n \n http://puellula.com/Main.html \n \n http://childlove.0catch.com/index.html\n \n There are of course, the more extreme organisations, such as the infamous NAMBLA, which calls for an abolition of age of consent laws. Although the organisation itself has not been charged with illegal activity, many of its members have been arrested for child molestation/rape, production of CP and child prostitution :xcensored emoticon_mad \n \n Neither of these organisations has had much success in its history, however, most of them seem to call for paedophilia to be seen, no longer as a mental disease, but a sexual orientation (even if one that doesn't work)\n \n As for psychologists who question the idea of paedophilia being wrong, there has been a broad range of views and theories as to what causes paedophilia. Unfortunately, none of these theories can be proven beyond the shadow of a doubt.\n \n As to their question as to whether sexual activity between adults and minors is inherently harmful, I have spoken both to people who were molested and coerced into sex, saying it scarred them for life and to those who had sexual relations with adults during childhood (pre-adolescence) and discribe it as a neutral, or even positive experience (sorry, but no factual references to this; no proof or statistics...you'll just have either to take it or leave it. It's up to you whether you think that's ########ing or not). \n This has indeed led me to believe that there is a form of exagerated hysteria concerning paedophilia. It confuses me. To me, anyone who rapes or coerces a child into sex deserves to spend the rest of his life as someone harry inmate's prison bitch (at the very least emoticon_xkill :) ). \n However, I don't see the sense in making barbaric statements about public executions, murder fantasies, and butchering people to death. Let's please try to remain as rational and non-emotional as possible on this (no offense). \n \n I would be interested in hearing more opinions/arguments about this, as long as they're logical and not based on primal impulses. And let's not jump back to homosexuals, the death sentence in Texas and so on. I doubt that Mr. Foundit66 or JPSartre12 or any of the others will have further success in convincing eachother of their views on these subjects. It might help to be a little more diplomatic and less personal, wouldn't it?\n \n Nadogi",

Unfortunately, none of these theories can be proven beyond the shadow of a doubt.\n\n I just wanted to add something on to this comment.\n There has been a variety of research that demonstrates that the victims of child molestation are more inclined to REPEAT those offenses upon others when they grow up. I suspect the mechanism is much like how victims of child abuse often become abusers themselves.\n \n And as for questioning the idea of pedophilia being wrong, a lot of the attempts to move along those lines center around examining how the child RECOVERS from the trauma, and the child's capability AFTER the recovery. Like in the face of any trauma, some people become more resilient. But that doesn't make the trauma a good thing.\n If you break your arm, the healing of the break will make the bone stronger at the point of the break than in other spots. But that doesn't mean we should go around breaking kids arms to make their bones stronger...",

   "I realize that the original poster mentioned pedophilia I believe that he meant the attraction to anyone under 18. The problem with this subject is the inherent wrongness that has been impressed on American society. It's hard to have a conversation without someone being called a pervert of someone commenting about how much they would like to hurt someone, it's sad. I think that sexual feelings or actions of any kind are seen as some kind of inherently taboo subject that is not proper to talk about and, in many ways we people are in denial. Don't believe me? Go talk to a random person about masturbation.:) Everyone has done it and almost all enjoy it, but for some reason people don't want to talk about it or even try to deny that they have done it. Anyway, the real question is weather or not there is a specific age when minors are able to decide if they want to have sexual contact and if it makes a difference who they have contact with. \n \n I personally believe that if an adolescent has sexual feeling of any kind they should feel free to talk about it with an adult, this would be very beneficial to them. Unfortunately this is not the case and many parents try to forget that kids even have these feelings. I do believe that a minor can be mature enough to make a decision about sexual contact. To ask them to repress their feelings is asking for trouble, but the parents should be involved. Parents should be close enough to their children to guide them through this stage and if the minor seems logical and maybe even has a crush, there is no reason to try to stop them from experiencing any sexual experience that is not inherently harmful. \n \n Many minors do have sex and certainly enjoy it. What big leap is there to go from masturbation to sex? The only real difference is the love of another. As long as it's love, who cares where it comes from? Don't kill me!emoticon_wow If you are against this I would like for you to explain why mutual sexual contact between two people who care for each other is harmful. If the argument is that the minor may become attached then no one should ever enter a relationship, especially if they really love someone. Obviously both parties must genuinely love each other for the relationship to be beneficial, but this is the case in all relationships. If the argument is that they may get hurt, then I wonder how the pain of breaking up is any worse than the pain of losing loved one. They seem to get along OK after a loss.\n \n The age at which they can make this decision for themselves is obviously a hot topic. I believe that if they start having sexual feelings they have reached a point where they are going to experiment and ,as long as it is not harmful, this shouldn't be discouraged. There is no set age, it varies and should not be legislated. Again, as long as the minor is TRUELY the initiator I don't personally see a problem with it. Do you think they should, will or do wait until their 18th birthday?\n \n I find it funny that the great majority of guys you ask about attraction to minors start saying how sick and disgusting it is because I guarantee you almost all of those guys would find some minors attractive. That shows you how twisted they really are. Britney Spears was certainly very unattractive in her first video (barely 17) and when she was a year younger surely no one would be attracted to her, /3u||$}{|t! Here, this should lighten things up a bit. Gee, I wonder why \"teen\" porn is so popular? Many of the girls in \"teen\" porn are betrayed as naive school girls or cheerleaders(not college students), certainly adults don't find schoolgirls attractive! When I was 16-17 I started dating a 14 year old girl but when I turned 18 U had to call it off, overnight being attracted to 15-16 year old made me a real sick bastard that deserved to die on TV.emoticon_mad It sucked. Is that right? Was I any different from the time I met her? Nope.\n \n So to sum it up, IMO there is no magical age at which a minor becomes sexually mature enough to have a relationship, it should be their decision. Also, as long as both parties truly love each other and the minor is safe and is the instigator I don't have a problem with any relationship. Again, please don't kill me! I'm not really a bad guy, I promise.emoticon_xangel",

Well no that is simply them saying that they want to engage in sexual contact, if that's they way they fell, that act alone is not \"wrong\". Now, I think what you really meant is will they make the right decision. Certainly they will not always make the right decision, but who does? The bottom line to me is that if they feel that way (I doubt they will at 9) they should be able to say so. Why is \"sexual contact\" with someone who genuinely loves them worse than masturbation? I do not think that they should have the final say, though.\n \n Third question: If the parents consent then I think it is their right to allow their son or daughter to do what they deem acceptable. I don't think that this is a bad choice if made for the right reasons but even if it was we should allow it. Many parents make honorable choices for their kids and we do nothing to intervene. This is all assuming that they are merely allowing the kid to do it and not forcing them. Obviously they should be protective and make sure that the man/woman truly loves their child, I do believe that it is possible for that love to exists.

Look, if anybody doesn't truly want to engage in sex then they should not. No one should be forced, we agree on that. I would like to see a study of true pedofelia with two willing partners in a country where it is accepted. I bet that you would find that healthy relationships are possable. Those who force childer to engage in sexual activities are the same kind of people that would rape adults. When you say \"pedofile\" to most people the person they visualize is a twisted individaul who fantasizes about sneeking up on unsuspecting little girls on the way home from school and raping them before killing them. This is no more logical than thinking that all men that are attracted to adults are serial rapists who also leave their victims physicaly and emotionally scared or dead. I think that most of the people that act on their sexual feelings are the sick ones. Most pedofiles just fantisize and leave it at that, they have no choice other than breaking the law. WAIT! Pedofiles can obey laws and be productive citisens?!:xbanghead Yes, it's illegal so they don't do it. Not to mention they can't have a real relaionship, which true pedofiles will want.

Give me an example of LOVE not being good and I bet that it is not love. You even state that adult/adolescent relationships may be healthy, are you sick? P.C. America thinks you are. True, some adults can manipulate younger people who are inexperienced and the may love someone that isn't good for them. This does not change with age, some adults are manipulated and do love people who hurt them more than they help them. Even if we shelter our kids until they are 21, one day they will have to fend for themselves and will eventually be hurt be someone, sad but true. What about the positive effects of having someone CLOSER than your parents guide you through the most awkward and potentially hurtful times in your life? Some who you can ask ALL of the question that want to but can't really ask your parents? People love to dismiss the thought that any good MAY come from such a \"wrong\" thing. I'm glad that you do agree that parental consent could be a solution. We let them decide on everything else, why not this?\n \n It's funny how Americans look at the mental capabilities of young people. \n \n You can be charged as an adult for 1st degree murder at 11. \n \n You should repress your sexual feelings until someone you've never met decides that you are mature enough to act them out, even if you really love your partner and they love you.\n \n If you have sex while you are a minor, make sure not to love someone who is mature enough to have sex. \n EXCEPTION: They may be as old as 21 if you live in certain states, apparently sex with a person that is 18 or 21 is different than sex with a 19 or 22 year old some how.

   "I disagree, age of concent laws are tied into pedofelia activism, they want them abolished.\n\n Let's try to distinguish something here.\n The original article WAS about the scientific / medical analysis of the effects of pedophilia on victims. That is true.\n Pedophile activists are trying to abolish age of consent laws. That is also true.\n \n \n \nI think that it should be up to the minor and their parents.

Rapes would stay pretty constant and those bastards should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.\n\n I disagree.\n A person who has not reached puberty, and indeed some kids that have, are incapable of knowledgeably consenting to sex. They can be coerced into doing things before they fully understand what it is they are doing. And in the process, they will end up harming themselves, psychologically and/or physically.\n \n \n \nFirst question: Not really, they are not acting on those urges and as long as they aren't hurting anyone I don't care. I will say that it seems a little strange but so do many things.\n\n What about the harm they bring to themselves?\n THAT is what these articles and research studies are about. The fact that it is documentable that pedophile victims experience psychological and physiological damage.\n Shouldn't we protect kids from doing something dumb, when they aren't old enough to be aware of the consequences?\n \n \n \nSecond question: Is it wrong for them to consent? Well no that is simply them saying that they want to engage in sexual contact, if that's they way they fell, that act alone is not \"wrong\". Now, I think what you really meant is will they make the right decision. Certainly they will not always make the right decision, but who does? The bottom line to me is that if they feel that way (I doubt they will at 9) they should be able to say so.\n\n I am having serious difficulty with your approach.\n You want to gloss over the \"9-year old\" because you \"doubt they will\" engage in what we are talking about.\n Let's get over this, and acknowledge that they DO engage in this. Maybe not to the sweeping numbers that our 16-year olds do, but 9-year olds ARE coerced by pedophiles. Enticed with promises of friendship or candy or X-Box 360s.\n If you deny that this takes place, then please state so.\n If you don't, then please ACKNOWLEDGE this reality instead of glossing over the fact that it only happens in fewer cases...\n \n To your question, I would say that they are wrong. Just like a child is wrong when it takes a cookie without permission. Those \"9-year olds\" who are coerced are almost invariably coerced without the parent's knowledge or consent.\n \n And for those even rarer cases that do have the parent's knowledge or consent, it's still wrong. Just because a parent molests his own child doesn't mean he gets a freebie. Just because a parent could sell his own child for sex doesn't mean he gets a freebie.\n \n \n \nWhy is \"sexual contact\" with someone who genuinely loves them worse than masturbation? I do not think that they should have the final say, though.\n\n It's not \"genuine love\" when you do something to a child that has been PROVEN to harm that child.\n And please note. YOU are trying to blur the line between 9-year olds and 16-year olds.\n I will not. I am talking about what the ORIGINAL ARTICLE was talking about. Scientifically classified pedophilia.\n \n \n \nThird question: If the parents consent then I think it is their right to allow their son or daughter to do what they deem acceptable.\n\n As previously mentioned, it has been scientifically proven that the child is harmed from pedophilia.\n Older kids well past puberty, you have a stronger case for.\n But as for pedophilia, that harm would constitute child neglect or abuse.\n You call it love. Science proves a harm.\n Since when does love cause the \"loved\" one to be psychologically or physiologically harmed? That isn't \"love\" that does that...\n \n \n \nWhere? (sorry, I don't have time to look, working long hours) To be honest, I don't think that they are the results of \"pedophilia\". They are mainly the result of sexual abuse and rape. Look, if anybody doesn't truly want to engage in sex then they should not. No one should be forced, we agree on that. I would like to see a study of true pedofelia with two willing partners in a country where it is accepted. I bet that you would find that healthy relationships are possable. \n\n If YOU can produce such a study, I urge you to produce it.\n But whether it be rape or not, it is documentable that the child is damaged by the act.\n \n \n \nWhen you say \"pedofile\" to most people the person they visualize is a twisted individaul who fantasizes about sneeking up on unsuspecting little girls on the way home from school and raping them before killing them. This is no more logical than thinking that all men that are attracted to adults are serial rapists who also leave their victims physicaly and emotionally scared or dead.\n\n \"Logic\" has nothing to do with it.\n Pedophiles act in secret. They don't tell the parents of what they are doing. They persuade the child to keep it secret. They forcibly rape or coerce the child into sexual acts. That is the reality of pedophilia. You will be hard pressed to find a child in a pedophilia relationship that isn't as I describe above. If you can show any documentable cases, I urge you to do so.\n \n Homosexuals are two consenting adults. There is no coercion. Often, the parents do know. I have only one gay friend who isn't out to his family.\n Homosexual rape is as documentable as pedophilia, and if you want to compare statistics, we could. The problem is that homosexual rape is rare, and statistics on pedophilia rape are much easier to come by.\n \n \n \nPedofiles can obey laws and be productive citisens?!:xbanghead Yes, it's illegal so they don't do it. Not to mention they can't have a real relaionship, which true pedofiles will want. The other bastards are lowlifes and rapists. (Pedofile = lowlife rapist) = not true\n\n Actually, statistics show that the majority of pedophiles ARE NOT just attracted to children. They are also attracted to adult women, and/or men.\n \n This discussion is making me wonder. You see, I HAVE researched pedophilia and the studies on it. You admit that you haven't.\n How do you come by the knowledge you claim to have about pedophiles?\n Or is it pure speculation on your part?\n \n \n \nI disagree, ALL love is healthy. Give me an example of LOVE not being good and I bet that it is not love.\n\n If a pedophile \"loves\" the child, he will realize when his sexual overtures towards the child will result in physiological or psychological damage.\n You are right. Love \"not being good\" is not love.\n That is the reality of pedophilia.\n If you can document that which you claim, beyond just claiming, I urge you to do so...\n \n \n \nYou even state that adult/adolescent relationships may be healthy, are you sick? P.C. America thinks you are.\n\n Again, you attempt to blur the lines.\n There is a clear difference between the two situations that we should not blur.\n \n \n \nTrue, some adults can manipulate younger people who are inexperienced and the may love someone that isn't good for them. This does not change with age, some adults are manipulated and do love people who hurt them more than they help them. Even if we shelter our kids until they are 21, one day they will have to fend for themselves and will eventually be hurt be someone, sad but true.\n\n Seriously.\n Do you think the \"hurt\" to a 9-year old being the victim of pedophilia is comparable to a 21-year old being hurt by a break-up?\n The \"hurt\" to the 9-year old is documentable, typically requiring therapy.\n \n A question for you.\n Suppose a 9-year old is a victim of pedophilia.\n Ten years later, he gets to make a decision about the \"sentence\" of the adult who molested him.\n Wouldn't he be the best to decide the \"sentence\", considering his innate knowledge of the situation?\n \n \n \nWhat about the positive effects of having someone CLOSER than your parents guide you through the most awkward and potentially hurtful times in your life?\n\n If an adult wants to do that, then all the more power to them.\n But a pedophile relationship is typically about coercion towards sex. Not about helping the child. The pedophile typically threatens or shames or coerces the child into not telling.\n That isn't \"love\".\n That isn't \"guiding\" through an \"awkward and potentially hurtful time\". That is CREATING one.\n \n \n \nYou can be charged as an adult for 1st degree murder at 11.\n\n I don't agree with that practice of prosecution, and I recognize there are some inconsistencies in the system.\n \n \n \nYou should repress your sexual feelings until someone you've never met decides that you are mature enough to act them out, even if you really love your partner and they love you.\n\n Quite frankly, one of the problems with pedophilia is that it is the ADULT trying to get the CHILD into bed by coercion or threats or shame...\n In addition to the above requested substantiation, I would recommend you show me quantitative cases where it was the CHILD who made these choices.\n \n \n \nBTW: it's dumb to not be able to post links until you post 10 times.\n\n I believe it is part of Spam filtering.\n If you e-mail it to my account, I will post it for you (if it's not spam or sexual in content).

And in the process, they will end up harming themselves, psychologically and/or physically.\n\n \n I understand what you are saying, but remember that I'm saying that parents should have the final say. I think that the reason I feel differently than most of this issue is that I don't put sex on a pedestal. I think that it is simply a natural physical/emotional process. I am NOT saying that sex with younger individuals would occur naturally. I just think that there is a great effort to put an emphases on this simple physical activity. I also do not think they will be psychologically hurt if it is something they want to do, they are already doing it today. As far as the physical harm goes, at the age most minors experience sexual feeling (puberty) I don't think there would be a problem. If intercourse is imposable, the adult should know better than to try.\n \n \n\n What about the harm they bring to themselves?\n THAT is what these articles and research studies are about. The fact that it is documentable that pedophile victims experience psychological and physiological damage.\n Shouldn't we protect kids from doing something dumb, when they aren't old enough to be aware of the consequences?\n\n \n I have not had a chance to look at the studies, are they in a country where it is accepted and both parties are willing and not being coerced? What studies are you referring to? I have not read the whole thread. I doubt all of these conditions are met.\n \n \nI am having serious difficulty with your approach.\n You want to gloss over the \"9-year old\" because you \"doubt they will\" engage in what we are talking about.\n Let's get over this, and acknowledge that they DO engage in this. Maybe not to the sweeping numbers that our 16-year olds do, but 9-year olds ARE coerced by pedophiles. Enticed with promises of friendship or candy or X-Box 360s.\n If you deny that this takes place, then please state so.\n If you don't, then please ACKNOWLEDGE this reality instead of glossing over the fact that it only happens in fewer cases...\n\n \n I did not mean to infer that 9 year olds are not being taken advantage of, and it's sick. What I am trying to say is that in the event that we let the parents decide and sexual contact would only occur if the child showed intrest first, the likelihood of a 9 year old having sexual feelings for the right reasons is nearly zero. It would be up to the parents to ensure this. Also, it is true that they are being coerced be pedophile RAPISTS, there is a HUGE difference.\n \n \nTo your question, I would say that they are wrong. Just like a child is wrong when it takes a cookie without permission. Those \"9-year olds\" who are coerced are almost invariably coerced without the parent's knowledge or consent.\n\n \n I'm not talking about children who are coerced. I'm talking about a child admitting that they are sexually interested, that's it. I doubt a 9 year old will be though. I know, they can be coerced, right? Well, then the coercion is wrong.\n \n \nAnd for those even rarer cases that do have the parent's knowledge or consent, it's still wrong. Just because a parent molests his own child doesn't mean he gets a freebie. Just because a parent could sell his own child for sex doesn't mean he gets a freebie.\n\n \n I'm not talking about incest, again I'm talking about the situation we discussed earlier, parental control and a child that shows interest first. I'm sorry if I was not clear. Molestation and prostitution is not legal so they should be punished.\n \n \nIt's not \"genuine love\" when you do something to a child that has been PROVEN to harm that child.\n And please note. YOU are trying to blur the line between 9-year olds and 16-year olds.\n I will not. I am talking about what the ORIGINAL ARTICLE was talking about. Scientifically classified pedophilia.\n\n \n I agree, that would not be love, but I don't think that the studies that \"prove\" pedophilia is harmful are really looking at pedophilia. I bet they throw in rape cases and cases of sexual abuse and coercion. That's like me throwing adult sex in with rape and prostitution and saying that regular adult sex between a husband and wife is a bad thing by using rape and prostitution cases to prove it. Sure, most PRACTICING pedophiles are the rapists, no one else can be a practicing pedophile. They can not openly have a relationship, so some of them will do whatever it takes, they should be punished severely. I am NOT trying to blur the line and to me there is no line, there is only a person with or without sexual feelings, that is where the line is drawn and age is irrelevant. However, most prepubesent children will not have sexual feelings. Also you are not really talking about pedophilia in most of your post, you are talking about rape and sexual abuse. Remember, you can be a pedophile and never do ANYTHING to a child, it's merely an attraction. \n \n Are you referring to the wiki article? It states the opposite.\n \n \nAs previously mentioned, it has been scientifically proven that the child is harmed from pedophilia.\n Older kids well past puberty, you have a stronger case for.\n But as for pedophilia, that harm would constitute child neglect or abuse.\n You call it love. Science proves a harm.\n Since when does love cause the \"loved\" one to be psychologically or physiologically harmed? That isn't \"love\" that does that.\n\n \n I don't call EVERY case of pedophilia \"love\", just as you don't call all cases of adult attraction \"love\". I'm just saying that the love is possible. Also, I think those studies are biased and mix rape and sexual abuse in with the relationships of an adult and child that are in a good mutual relationship. Honestly, I don't think they even include those relationships in the studies because they don't exist in the countries that they study. Don't forget that being a pedophile does not mean that you act on those feelings, therefor it will hurt no one.\n \n \nIf YOU can produce such a study, I urge you to produce it.\n But whether it be rape or not, it is documentable that the child is damaged by the act.\n\n \n Unfortunately I can't find one, I don't think it is popular to do an honest study on this issue and it is certainly not funded by anyone. Look at what you wrote! Of coarse a child, or anyone, will be damaged by RAPE! That's a totally diferent subject and is exactly why the studies are flawed.\n \n \n\"Logic\" has nothing to do with it.\n Pedophiles act in secret. They don't tell the parents of what they are doing. They persuade the child to keep it secret. They forcibly rape or coerce the child into sexual acts. That is the reality of pedophilia. You will be hard pressed to find a child in a pedophilia relationship that isn't as I describe above. If you can show any documentable cases, I urge you to do so.\n\n \n Most pedophiles don't act, persuade a child, rape or coerce. Once again you are confusing a pedophile ( one that is merely attracted to prepubesent children) with a rapist ( one who force another to engage in sex). This is typical and it is why people who just admit that they are attracted to young children are hated and not pitied. THAT is not the reality, it's how you choose to see it. It will be hard for me to find a relationship like the one you request because they are outlawed almost everywhere. Even if they do exist they are not made public. If good studies existed it would be easy, but they do not and ti makes a discussion difficult.\n \n \nHomosexuals are two consenting adults. There is no coercion. Often, the parents do know. I have only one gay friend who isn't out to his family.\n Homosexual rape is as documentable as pedophilia, and if you want to compare statistics, we could. The problem is that homosexual rape is rare, and statistics on pedophilia rape are much easier to come by.\n\n \n Where did the whole homosexual thing come from? I was merely saying that a pedophile is not necessarily a rapist.\n \n \nActually, statistics show that the majority of pedophiles ARE NOT just attracted to children. They are also attracted to adult women, and/or men.\n\n \n How does this effect the discussion? I never said that all pedophiles are only attracted to children.\n \n \nThis discussion is making me wonder. You see, I HAVE researched pedophilia and the studies on it. You admit that you haven't.\n How do you come by the knowledge you claim to have about pedophiles?\n Or is it pure speculation on your part?\n\n \n I have looked at a \"study\" or two but that is not the only way I have looked into it. I have visited LEGAL sites that pedophiles frequent, many without any pictures at all. I know that they are not unbiased, but the people seemed honest. If you are insinuating that I am a pedophile, I assure you that I am not. A Hebephile or Ephebophile maybe, but not a pedophile.\n \n \nIf a pedophile \"loves\" the child, he will realize when his sexual overtures towards the child will result in physiological or psychological damage.\n You are right. Love \"not being good\" is not love.\n That is the reality of pedophilia.\n If you can document that which you claim, beyond just claiming, I urge you to do so...\n\n \n I haven't seen a study that fairly judges a mutual relationship between a child and an adult. The tend to study rapists and use that to condemn pedophilia. Would you see a study of men who rape adults as a study of adult sexuality? I'm not trying to convince anyone that I am right, but biased studies will not convince me.\n \n \nAgain, you attempt to blur the lines.\n There is a clear difference between the two situations that we should not blur.\n\n \n WTF are you talking about? I was merely stating that most Americans would think you are \"sick\" for thinking that a healthy relationship between an adult and a minor is possible. America is obsessed with being \"PC\".\n \n \nSeriously.\n Do you think the \"hurt\" to a 9-year old being the victim of pedophilia is comparable to a 21-year old being hurt by a break-up?\n The \"hurt\" to the 9-year old is documentable, typically requiring therapy.\n\n \n I think you are confused, no one is a victim of pedophilia, only of rape and sexual abuse. Is an adult that is raped the victim of heterosexuality? NO! I was comparing break-up to break-up.\n \n \nA question for you.\n Suppose a 9-year old is a victim of pedophilia.\n Ten years later, he gets to make a decision about the \"sentence\" of the adult who molested him.\n Wouldn't he be the best to decide the \"sentence\", considering his innate knowledge of the situation?\n\n \n Show me 1 victim of pedophilia. HE WAS A VICTIM OF MOLESTATION, NOT PEDOFELIA. Again, you make the mistake that most people make. If he is the victim of MOLESTATION then, yes, he should be able to decide.\n \n \nIf an adult wants to do that, then all the more power to them.\n But a pedophile relationship is typically about coercion towards sex. Not about helping the child. The pedophile typically threatens or shames or coerces the child into not telling.\n That isn't \"love\".\n That isn't \"guiding\" through an \"awkward and potentially hurtful time\". That is CREATING one\n\n \n Nope, you are describing a sexual abuser and trying to put all pedophiles in that category. I agree, abusers are evil. Again, pedophiles don't necessarily act on their feelings and even if they did IMO many would love, not hurt.\n \n \nQuite frankly, one of the problems with pedophilia is that it is the ADULT trying to get the CHILD into bed by coercion or threats or shame...\n In addition to the above requested substantiation, I would recommend you show me quantitative cases where it was the CHILD who made these choices\n.\n \n Again, you make the same mistake, not all pedophiles rape. IMO 80%+ never act on their feelings. I will admit that I can show you no fair studies, they are nearly non-existent. Have you looked at the studies quoted in the Wiki article? I do agree that very few prepubescent children would truly want to engage in any sexual contact.\n \n \nI believe it is part of Spam filtering.\n If you e-mail it to my account, I will post it for you (if it's not spam or sexual in content). Click on the \"Private Messages\" above...\n\n \n Thank you for the offer, but I don't even remember what I was going to link to.\n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n perverted-justice\n \n Well, I don't like them. Even when they don't get evidence to use in a case they enjoy ruining the lives of people that have not been convicted of anything. I do agree that if these guys are going over to have sex with a person they think is underage then they should be arrested, because it is illegal, weather I think it should be or not.\n \n BTW: here is a link to a perverted-justice critics site just for the hell of it. corrupted-justice dot com",

We are talking about a situation where sex will only be allowed if the child shows interest for the right reasons first and the parents decide that it's OK. I stated that in my last post. This would virtually eliminate all sex between 9 year olds and adults, period. Therefor most of my post is referring to post-pubescent teens.\n \n \n\"doing it\"...... and the world of the 9-year old, where the vast majority of them aren't \"doing it\".\n I'ld be curious as to the statistics on how many 9-year olds are \"doing it\" and how many have been a victim of child rape or coercion at that stage of their life.\n\n The part about being a victim of child RAPE and COERCION is important to remember because later you claim that they are a victim of the attraction an adult has for them(pedophilia) and not the actions of that adult. The truth is that they are no more a victim of pedophilia as an adult rape victim is the victim of heterosexuality. It's the act of raping that hurts them, if someone is attracted to them but never acts there is no harm. That proves that it is not the pedophilia it's self that hurts anyone. Why can't you understand this?\n \n \nThere was a study that I will have to review my files for that demonstrated that at a certain age, there is a shift in teen-age pregnancy cases. Older than X age, a teen-ager who is pregnant is likely to be pregnant by somebody her own age. Younger than X age, a teen-ager who is pregnant is likely to be pregnant by somebody MUCH OLDER than her own age. And as the age grows and shrinks, so does the odds. Much younger than X age shows that the child is EVEN MORE likely to be pregnant by somebody much older. (And by much older, I believe the study demonstrated a significant age gap of at least ten years.)\n \n These issues have NOTHING to do with \"pedastal\".\n \n\n \n Child rape is to pedophilia as adult rape is to heterosexuality. How much easier can it get? I know that it happens and is committed buy the same kind of people who rape adults. Also, when I stated that people put sex on a pedestal, it was not directed at you. It was a general statement.\n \n \nRegarding the \"physical harm\" comments, I am typically commenting on INHERENT physical harm by an adult on a prepubescent child. I'm not trying to say that a 16-year old girl is going to be inherently harmed.\n\n \n Obviously sex between an adult and a really young child will cause physical harm, I said that if it was imposable that the adult should not try it. I should have said if it was not possible without physical harm, but that is nit-picking. I just want to say, again, that prepubescent children would not want to engage in sex at that age for the right reasons and that would eliminate this problem in the situation all of my posts have been about(parental control).\n \n \nThe whole \"country where it is accepted\" thing is irrelevant. It would be more of an issue of your burden of proof to bring up countries where it is accepted, and show any difference between them and countries where it is not.\n You need to prove relevance there.\n\n \n What I am saying is that to fairly judge pedophilia it has to be in a country that it is seen as normal. You couldn't have a good study of homosexuality in a country where it is hated or not allowed, the same it the case with pedophilia. I wish I could find a study like the one I described, I might look for one later.\n \n \nBut as for \"studies\", here are some examples of demonstratable harm...\n \n \"Further, a consistent finding was that women and men whose sexual abuse involved touching were more suicidal, less able to cope, and felt less responsible to their families than nonabused students. Adults whose sexual abuse was exploitative but involved no touch were not significantly different from nonabused adults. The experience of being touched in a sexual way appears to be more damaging than other kinds of unwanted sexual experiences. ...\"\n Debra K. Peters and Lillian M. Range, \"Childhood Sexual Abuse and Current Suicidality in College Women and Men,\"\n Child Abuse & Neglect 19 (1995): 339. \n\n \n Notice that they never mention pedophilia once. They are talking about sexual abuse and rape, at any age it will harm the victim. I'm not saying the children aren't more effected, but this is not pedophilia. Remember the analogy above? Rape is NOT pedophilia. \n \n \n1) The chances being \"nearly zero\" are irrelevant.\n If there was \"nearly zero\" chance that I would want to kill my neighborhood, there should still be a law against it.\n\n \n Yeah, lets equate a person having sexual feelings for the right reasons to the cold-blooded murder of a human being. Way to be objective.\n \n \n2) And regarding the \"parents to ensure this\", are you willing to yield that if the parents DO NOT ensure this, that they should go to jail along with the pedophile?\n\n \n Yes, I agree, they should all go to jail if that's the case. They would be better off without parents like that.\n \n \n3) If you can give information / statistics on the pedophiles who have consent from the parents, and don't coerce the child, that would be useful. Because as matters stand, when an adult pursues these types of illicit relationships with the child, the chances are \"nearly zero\" that there isn't coercion involved. The chances are \"nearly zero\" that the parent knows.\n\n \n Nice use of my quotes, I see what ya did there.:) You are correct, the only people who pursue sex with a child now are the rapists and sexual abusers. I have already said that, go back and read. This does not reflect pedophilia itself. It is impossible, and illegal, for a well meaning pedophile to seek a good relationship. Here is a newsflash for ya, if you make something illegal, the only people who will do it are criminals. If all sex was seen as evil (like sex between an adult and child) and it was a federal crime if you engaged in it (like sex between an adult and child) do you think that all sex would stop? Nope, people would break the law.\n \n \nLet's say a 9-year old expresses interest in driving a car.\n Does that mean it should be legal for him to do so?\n The reasons this is illegal is because of the harm it brings to the child.\n The child's \"interest\" is irrelevant.\n \n\n \n You like hypothetical questions, don't you? If he is physically able, mature enough and skilled enough then I don't have a problem with it. Here, I'll make your argument for you. What makes me think that a 9YO is mature enough to have sex? I never said that they were, I said that it should be up to the parents to decide. It doesn't matter if they are 10,11,12, etc. as long as the parents decide that it is OK. What about a sex test, like a diving test? If they passed the test would you be OK with it? It would ensure that they were ready, right? I bet a lot of adults would fail too.\n \n Then perhaps you should start quantifying what you are talking about.\n Show examples where parents don't have a problem with a 9-year old having sex with a 30-year old man, who has fully informed the parent of his actions and intent and the 9-year old has exclusive control over the situation. \n \n You obviously know that this is imposable to do. Not because such a relationship is imposable, but because it is illegal. The minute a man even tried to befriend a child he would be under suspicion. I will see if I can find any writing about mutual child-adult relationships.\n \n \nPart of the problem with the fairy tale you keep spinning is that the 9-year old is typically in a situation where he has been taught to respect adults and yield to their authority. In such a situation, the 30-year old has an inherent advantage on the playing field.\n\n \n Fairy tale, huh? Yes, right now it is, this kind of thing is not allowed and even if it was very few 9YO would want such a thing. As I have said before, prepubescent kids are not generally sexual and that means that one should not try to sexualize them. So I guess that being with a mature person that your parents know very well is worse thatn being with the immature punk down the street, huh? That's great logic, we all have the capacity to do evil(even the punk down the street), that doesn't mean that we should assume that everyone will do evil.\n \n \nI think you are trying to pretend that this is like any other relationship between adults, but it isn't. Pedophiles typically KNOW their victims, and are typically in positions of authority, whether perceived or actual. School teachers. Parents. Relatives. People who HAVE AUTHORITY over the child, and thus \"coercion\" is inherent.\n \n\n \n Again, there is no such thing as a pedophile victim, only abuse victims. Replace \"pedophiles\" with child rapists and I would agree, for the most part. Power and coercion doesn't necessarily go hand in hand.\n \n \nI hate to break it to you, but that IS pedophilia.\n That is the VAST MAJORITY of what happens when a pedophile sexually acts on his desires.\n So your complaint is moot.\n\n \n I hate to break it to you, but that IS rape. Again, child rape is to pedophilia as adult rape is to heterosexuality. Do you agree?\n \n \nThe vast majority of sex is consensual.\n Not rape.\n Not prostitution.\n\n \n So you see the obserdity of trying to prove a case against adult sex using that method. WOW, it's a breakthrough. That's what I am saying about the \"studies of pedophilia\", they are really \"studies of sexual abuse\". I know that you an almost everyone else think the are one in the same, but they are not. is being attracted to someone the same as raping them? Nope, so being attracted to children (pedophilia) is not the same as raping them. I honestly don't know how you can't see this.\n \n \nI'm curious if you realize that even if laws were changed as you advocate, things wouldn't change.\n The pedophiles hide themselves from BOTH the LAW, AND THE PARENTS.\n So this fantasy whereby parents \"consent\" and pre-pubescent children just think of it all on their own is inane and pointless.\n\n \n Again, pedophiles are not necessarily rapists who \"hide themselves from BOTH the LAW, AND THE PARENTS\". Also, you must not be reading my posts, I have said that pre-pubesent children will almost never think of it on their own.:xbanghead Therefore they should not be allowed to have sex with anyone. This is also not my fantasy, it is a solution to the convoluted laws that exist in my opinion.\n \n \nAnd quite frankly, that isn't illegal. It also isn't a sexual relationship, and as such is moot for our discussion.\n\n \n Damn near, but I realize that it isn't a relationship. The statement I mad is relevant to our conversation because you keep grouping peaceful pedophiles with the rapists, is that relevant. I didn't realise that this thread was about rapist activism. It's not, that's why you nee to realize that you can be a pedophile and not have any victims. What if everytime I heard about a rape on the news I said\"those damned heterosexuals, there should be laws against heterosexuality\"? Doesn't make since, right?\n \n \nThe \"wikipedia\" article previously quoted is like much of pedophilia lore. Full of distortion and half-truths/mostly lies...\n \n I refuted it here.\n -------------------------\n If you want to address that, there it is.\n \n\n \n Well that's the one you were referring to when you were saying \"original article\" I was just pointing out that the article did not say pedophilia harmed anyone. I'm not arguing about the credibility of a wiki article, that's pointless. I will check out your link though.\n \n \n\n Let's just be more truthful and thorough about this.\n The cases of pedophilia that result in child sexual content are virtually UNILATERALLY all involving something that is NOT \"love\". Invariably, coercion or explicit force is involved. Parents are not informed.\n This is the reality of what pedophilia IS\n\n \n That's because any other type of relationship is imposable and also illegal. the only people who try to act on their attractions are people who do not obey the law(bad people) and they limit their risk by force and coercion. If you look up the definition of pedophilia, it is merely an attraction. You can try to insirt you own definition all you want, but I KNOW what pedophilia is. You just like to group pedophilia and rape together, bad logic.\n \n \n\n You \"think\" that?\n Do you have any statistics or studies on actual cases where a pedophilia relationship involved a consenting prepubescent child, free from coercion, where the parent was informed?\n\n \n Of coarse that is what I \"think\", all of the posts made so far are opinions. What you \"think\" is no more profe than my \"thoughts\", I'm not trying to mislead by claiming my opinion as fact and change the meaning of words.\n \n \n\n Pedophiles that don't act on those feelings are irrelevant to this discussion.\n We are talking about pedophiles who DO pursue these interests. Who DO engage in these \"relationships\".\n\n \n Oh really? It's nice that you finally let me know what YOUR definition of pedophile is.:xbanghead I guess all pedophiles abuse children then, run, the sky is falling! The thing you must realise is that you are just saying \"pedophile\" not \"active pedophile\". You can't just use a word and change the meaning, from now on you should be more specific IMO. I also never claimed that rape was a relationship, that is what you are inferring. To be fair, I have talked about pedophiles who might engage in sexual activity IF the parental consent was allowed, maybe you thought I was referring to the current situation.\n \n\n So you conjure up this fairy tale about the pedophile who pursues a sexual relationship, informs the parent of his intent, the parents consent, and the child comes up with the idea of sex all on his own...\n And you have nothing to back it up?\n \n It's not that there aren't \"honest studies\".\n It's the fact that what you describe just plain doesn't exist.\n\n \n I'm trying not to really let you have it here, but you must be losing track somewhere. I never said that these relationships exist, I said that they might if \"parental consent\" was allowed. It's merely an opinion, I can't predict the future. Nice job TRYING to pin me but just showing that you are not paying attention. FYI relationships are allowed between children and adults in some countries and I'm sore the parents know. Just look up the age of consent around the world.\n \n \nStatistics?\n Proof of your claim?\n\n \n I never claimed that that statement was from an unbiased source, I even stated that they WERE biased! Again, not paying attention. I know a few pedophiles who never have and never will act on their feelings.\n \n \n \n\n Bigj480, this is the INFORMATION age.\n Anonymous people post anonymous stuff all the time.\n This whole \"outlawed\" XXXX is just PURE XXXX.\n Sodomy was illegal for decades during which people STILL DID STUDIES on gays.\n Kinsey himself included pedophiles in his studies, which he was criticized for but a house never fell on him.\n The VERY SOURCE of this thread involves scientists who are doing research which is not approved of, but IS STILL PUBLISHED\n\n \n The outlawed thing is XXXX? Pedophiles are pretty secretive and even if they had no chance of being outed they would never take the risk to become part of a study. That's the bottom line, it's so unpopular that if anyone found out that you are attracted to children you might as well get pervert tattooed on your forehead. I will look at the rebuttal that you posted but if you don't tread the whole study you are only getting part of the story.\n \n I have to get off, so I will not be able to respond to all of your post, it's way to much typing for me. I might get around to it later. I will sum up a few thing though. You say that most pedophiles abuse children, where is your proof? You ask me for proof, which IS understandable, but you must realise that with so much general bias it is hard to find scientific studies. You will probably see the following as an excuse, but I don't care. Often, it is possible to prove both sides of an argument with the same statistics if you leave out the inconvenient parts. Look at gun control, people feel strongly both ways and will give you statistics to prove it. In this thread I was merely stating my opinion and I admitted that I had no studies to go by. I will look for some type of study to \"prove\" my point in the future bu I realise that no one would care even if it did support my claims. Well see. So.....",

   "Listen, READ WHAT I AM SAYING. We are talking about a situation where sex will only be allowed if the child shows interest for the right reasons first and the parents decide that it's OK. I stated that in my last post. This would virtually eliminate all sex between 9 year olds and adults, period. Therefor most of my post is referring to post-pubescent teens.\n\n I have read and understood that.\n What you don't seem to understand is that \"virtually eliminate\" is not sufficient for me.\n Just plain illegal. That is the only acceptable standard.\n \n The point is that while you may be satisfied with your scenario, I am not.\n And the MAIN reason I am arguing with it is because of pedophilia. The whole \"age of consent\" thing AFTER puberty has some flexibility in my book. \n \n We've got 50 states with a range of rules on \"age of consent\".\n But every single state is against pedophilia.\n \n Maybe I should phrase this differently, because I am reading what you are saying.\n When I respond to you, I am SPECIFICALLY talking about my issues with pedophilia, unless I state otherwise.\n \n If you want to talk about \"age of consent\" for post-puberty, I am happy to delve into that subject too.\n I am just trying to delineate between the two because confusion can result if we just blindly lump the two together. Confusion as to what I am specifically saying...\n \n \n \nThe part about being a victim of child RAPE and COERCION is important to remember because later you claim that they are a victim of the attraction an adult has for them(pedophilia) and not the actions of that adult.\n\n Hold the phone.\n If I did say that, then I misphrased something. If you quote exactly where I said what you say, that would help resolve the issue.\n Let me make this clear. If a pedophile is just ATTRACTED to children, and he makes no action upon that attraction, then I see no harm to the child.\n \n \n \nThe truth is that they are no more a victim of pedophilia as an adult rape victim is the victim of heterosexuality.\n\n You repeat this over and over again, and it's just plain false.\n A man raping a woman IS AN EXAMPLE of heterosexuality.\n A man raping a child IS AN EXAMPLE of pedophilia.\n \n With that said, we must not BLINDLY generalize issues.\n The vast majority of heterosexual sexual actions ARE NOT rape, and thus we should not categorize them negatively because of rape.\n The vast majority of pedophilia sexual actions DO INVOLVE rape or coercion, along with secrecy from parents and other adult figure. Thus, it is entirely sensible to categorize them negatively.\n \n It's like having a barrel of apples and a barrel of oranges.\n 99% of the apples are worm-free. Ergo, we shouldn't blindly throw out the apple barrel.\n 99.9...% of the oranges are infected with disease. In fact, I'm still waiting to see an orange which doesn't have a disease.\n Ergo, it makes sense to throw out the orange barrel.\n \n \n \nObviously sex between an adult and a really young child will cause physical harm, I said that if it was imposable that the adult should not try it.\n\n Suppose little Johnny is hanging out with 30-year old Chris. And little Johnny, being 8-years old, is really curious about sex. He really wants to have sex with Chris, and it was Johnny's idea. The parents are okay with it.\n All things considered, this WILL end up physically harming Johnny.\n Should this be allowable? What do we do if the adult should \"know better\", but chooses an action that damages the child?\n \n I liken this to a parent who doesn't mind if his kid plays in traffic. As adults, it is negligence to allow children to do any foolish thing that they want to when they want to.\n \n \n \n...that would eliminate this problem in the situation all of my posts have been about(parental control).\n\n See my comments above.\n Parents don't always make the right decisions for their child. What do we do when a parent thinks it's okay for the child to experiment at 8 or 9 years old, with a 35-year old man?\n In this country, we have laws on childhood neglect and child abuse. Parents do neglect their child. \n \n What you propose would not \"eliminate\" anything.\n Do you understand that?\n If all parents were \"good\" parents, it would conceivably eliminate the issue.\n But they aren't.\n \n \n \nWhat I am saying is that to fairly judge pedophilia it has to be in a country that it is seen as normal. You couldn't have a good study of homosexuality in a country where it is hated or not allowed, the same it the case with pedophilia.\n\n I disagree.\n Again, sodomy has been illegal for decades, up until a couple of years ago.\n Yet we STILL had studies done on gays.\n Kinsey studied homosexuals and pedophiles BEFORE homosexuality was removed from the DSM as a mental disorder.\n \n Your requirement is pointless. There is no reason why a study on pedophilia can't be done in this country.\n All your requirement does is give you an excuse to ignore the studies that HAVE BEEN DONE in this country regarding pedophilia.\n \n On another level, could you imagine if that while homosexuality was illegal, the vast majority of homosexual sexual encounters involved rape???\n If that WERE true, I WOULD consider homosexuality to be seriously in question.\n \n \n \nYeah, lets equate a person having sexual feelings for the right reasons to the cold-blooded murder of a human being. Way to be objective.\n\n Way to avoid the point of my analogy.\n Choose whatever example you want. Choose a mosquito biting a child if you like. That would be nowhere near the inherent level of damage I am talking about, but rewrite the analogy WITH THE SAME POINT.\n And this time, address it.\n Near Zero probability is not enough. You are still talking about a probability that something inherently detrimental will happen to the child, and have it be completely legal.\n Something a LOT more serious than a mosquito bite.\n \n \n \nYou are correct, the only people who pursue sex with a child now are the rapists and sexual abusers. I have already said that, go back and read.\n\n The problem here isn't that I'm not \"reading\".\n It's that I don't think you get some CLEARLY FUNDAMENTAL FACTS of life.\n \n I am gay.\n If I were the ONLY gay person on the planet, doomed to a life of being attracted to people who did not want to have sex with me, doomed to a life of being condemned by others for my *secret* desire, I WOULD NEVER RAPE another human being.\n I would not.\n \n People live celibate lives all the time. Straight people go through dry spells. Boys go through puberty, one of the more \"horny\", and maintain their virginity. The stereo-typical nerd at the back of the class can feel attraction that isn't returned and not rape anyone.\n \n But as for pedophiles, they often DO NOT CONTAIN their desires to have sex with kids.\n They coerce. And they rape. And they force. And they make a kid do something against his will, and withhold that info from the parents.\n \n The point you are missing is this.\n Most of us in life go through stages where we are attracted, but are unable to have sex. We cope.\n Can you say the same about most pedophiles?\n \n \n \nThis does not reflect pedophilia itself. It is impossible, and illegal, for a well meaning pedophile to seek a good relationship. Here is a newsflash for ya, if you make something illegal, the only people who will do it are criminals. If all sex was seen as evil (like sex between an adult and child) and it was a federal crime if you engaged in it (like sex between an adult and child) do you think that all sex would stop? Nope, people would break the law.\n\n You are confusing a fundamental morality of having CONSENSUAL sex with a fundamental morality of RAPE.\n If sex was illegal, and all women refused to have sex, and most heterosexual men proceeded to rape women, THEN I would say that heterosexual males are obviously deranged.\n It IS NOT just that sex is illegal.\n It's the fact that they IGNORE the fact that their partner is unwilling, or that he/she was coerced, or ...\n \n You are missing a fundamental importance of CONSENT and what type of person ignores that consent and takes his sex despite a lack of consent.\n \n At one time, it was unheard of to charge a man with raping his wife. It was just not a legal reality.\n EVEN THEN, when it is completely legal for a man to rape his wife, do you think that a man raping his wife is similar to a man having consensual sex with his wife?\n \n The \"legality\" is irrelevant. You are hung up on it. YOU have put it on a pedastal.\n The REASON it is illegal is for all the reasons I have mentioned. Illegality is the CONSEQUENCE of these bad things.\n It DOES NOT cause these bad things...\n \n \n \nWhat makes me think that a 9YO is mature enough to have sex? I never said that they were, I said that it should be up to the parents to decide.\n\n I am identifying a disjoint here.\n A 9 year old IS NOT mature enough to have sex with an adult male.\n And let's not confuse the issue. The VAST majority of pedophiles are males. Not females.\n But getting back to the point, it DOES NOT MATTER if the parents think the kid is mature enough to play in traffic. If a parent thinks his/her kid should play in traffic if they want to, that parent is negligent and needs to be punished.\n \n \n \nIt doesn't matter if they are 10,11,12, etc. as long as the parents decide that it is OK.\n\n See, THIS is part of the reason I have harped on \"puberty\" as a marker/distinguisher.\n THAT is the line I am drawing.\n Before puberty, completely wrong due to the inherent damage to the child.\n After puberty? That issue has more flexibility.\n \n \n \nThen perhaps you should start quantifying what you are talking about.\n Show examples where parents don't have a problem with a 9-year old having sex with a 30-year old man, who has fully informed the parent of his actions and intent and the 9-year old has exclusive control over the situation. \n\n \"show examples\"???\n I am baffled by your challenge.\n If there are NO examples, that is a good thing.\n If there is ONE example, then it should be illegal due to the inherent harm caused to the 9-year old.\n If there are NO examples, and it's illegal, then who cares? Nobody is in jail.\n If there is ONE example of a 9-year old as described above, that is one too many and the situation demands jail time.\n \n I don't mean this derogatorily, but do you comprehend that some things should be illegal even if there is little to no chance it could happen?\n A civilian man blowing a nuclear weapon in the desert should be illegal.\n Even if it doesn't happen, it should still be illegal.\n Now the reason why it is illegal could be diverse. Environmental pollution. Damage to the civilian population who breathe in the air.\n Maybe there is no law that says \"Individuals can't blow up a nuclear weapons in the desert\". But the act should STILL be illegal.\n \n \n \nYou obviously know that this is imposable to do. Not because such a relationship is imposable, but because it is illegal. The minute a man even tried to befriend a child he would be under suspicion. I will see if I can find any writing about mutual child-adult relationships.\n\n I thought you claimed you had been to web-sites which talked about them.\n And as my e-mail is empty, I am taking it that you are not going to take me up on my request to show me these web-sites you previously talked about?",

That is the only acceptable standard.\"\n \n That's fine, I just don't think that there needs to be a specific number. What number would you choose?

The whole \"age of consent\" thing AFTER puberty has some flexibility in mybook.\n\n \n I understand, you don't like pedophilia, it also seems strange to me.

Confusion as to what I am specifically saying...\n\n \n Yeah, the confusion is mainly my fault. However, I do think that they are related, you want an age of consent to stop pedophilia. I just don't like \"extra\" laws and I really think that the AOC laws aren't necessary.\n \n \nHold the phone.\n If I did say that, then I misphrased something. If you quote exactly where I said what you say, that would help resolve the issue.\n Let me make this clear. If a pedophile is just ATTRACTED to children, and he makes no action upon that attraction, then I see no harm to the child.\n\n \n Every time you said \"victim of pedophilia\". Like I said, pedophilia is merely an adults attraction to prepubesent children. So you are saying that they are \"a victim of an adults attraction to prepubesent children\". You see, the attraction itself is not hurting anyone, it's the rape and molestation. I do realise that most of the time you hear about pedophilia it is because of a rape or molestation, but how else would you hear about it? It's not like all of the peaceful pedophiles publicise their attraction or will even admit to it. You, nor I, know ow many peaceful pedophiles there are.\n \n You repeat this over and over again, and it's just plain false.\n A man raping a woman IS AN EXAMPLE of heterosexuality.\n A man raping a child IS AN EXAMPLE of pedophilia.\n \n You really think this? I think that they are both examples of what evil some are capable of and that they do not have any bearing on the way we should think of most heterosexuals or pedophiles.\n \n \nWith that said, we must not BLINDLY generalize issues.\n The vast majority of heterosexual sexual actions ARE NOT rape, and thus we should not categorize them negatively because of rape.\n The vast majority of pedophilia sexual actions DO INVOLVE rape or coercion, along with secrecy from parents and other adult figure. Thus, it is entirely sensible to categorize them negatively.\n \n\n \n If adult sex was made illegal tomorrow and everyone who was even talked to in a sexual manner or suspected that two people might be engaging in sex reported it to the police and the perpetrator would go to jail, basically picture adult sex as hated and illegal as adult-child sex. Do you think their would be any arrests? I bet that rapes would sky rocket and the only time you would hear about adult sex would be in a negative light. So would that make it right to assume that adult sex is bad? After all, you would only hear about adult sex when it involved rape. How would one in a place like this have a meaningful sexual relationship with another adult? \n \n It's like having a barrel of apples and a barrel of oranges.\n 99% of the apples are worm-free. Ergo, we shouldn't blindly throw out the apple barrel.\n 99.9...% of the oranges are infected with disease. In fact, I'm still waiting to see an orange which doesn't have a disease.\n Ergo, it makes sense to throw out the orange barrel.\n \n That is a terrible analogy, that's like comparing apples to oranges.:) It's more like having an examiner (media) that hates oranges(pedophiles) and loves apples(sexually \"normal\" people) go through the apples and oranges and bring back 100 to document for a customer(society) who also hates oranges and wants them destroyed. The examiner arrives to find thousands of apples, all kept chilled, he goes through the apples and eaily finds some great ones. 90 are good! He then moves on to the oranges, but he sees only 100 sitting in the dirt, almost all are bad. Someone(law makers) buried a bunch of creates and there may be good oranges in them but the customer is out to prove that oranges suck and the examiner wants to please the customer, besides, he wants to be hired for the next project and the good ones will be HARD to get to. Even if he could find the person who owns the oranges(pedophiles in general), they would want to keep them buried so that the don't get destroyed. So he comes back with 100 bad oranges. This confirms the customers beliefs and he proceeds to destroy every orange he can find.\n \n \n\n Suppose little Johnny is hanging out with 30-year old Chris. And little Johnny, being 8-years old, is really curious about sex. He really wants to have sex with Chris, and it was Johnny's idea. The parents are okay with it.\n All things considered, this WILL end up physically harming Johnny.\n Should this be allowable? What do we do if the adult should \"know better\", but chooses an action that damages the child?\n\n \n The parents should be smart enough to know that full sex would be harmful and they should make sure that Chris has Johnny's best interest at heart and will no harm him. All three should go to jail for hurting Johnny, this would keep parents from not giving a #### and pedophiles from disregarding the well being of children. I do want to state, again, that this scenario would still be unlikely.\n \n \n\n I liken this to a parent who doesn't mind if his kid plays in traffic. As adults, it is negligence to allow children to do any foolish thing that they want to when they want to.\n\n \n I liken this to a parent who doesn't mind if his kid plays in sports. As adults, it is our right to allow children to do things that they want to if no harm results.\n \n \nSee my comments above.\n Parents don't always make the right decisions for their child. What do we do when a parent thinks it's okay for the child to experiment at 8 or 9 years old, with a 35-year old man?\n In this country, we have laws on childhood neglect and child abuse. Parents do neglect their child.\n\n \n Should we eliminate all of the choices we allow parents to make so that we cant pick the best for the child? What about parents who overfeed their children? What about parents who allow their kids to fail in school? These can have very bad effects on the rest of the child's life! Why do you choose the age of 8 and 39? What's the difference between a 20 YO and a 39 YO?\n \n \nWhat you propose would not \"eliminate\" anything.\n Do you understand that?\n If all parents were \"good\" parents, it would conceivably eliminate the issue.\n But they aren't.\n\n \n It would not lessen child abuse, I'll give you that, I don't think it would increase either. Child abuse will still be illegal and the parents and the child's sexual partner would be punished for their deeds. All parents are not good, but that does not mean we have the right to cut out every decision they can make.\n \n \nI disagree.\n Again, sodomy has been illegal for decades, up until a couple of years ago.\n Yet we STILL had studies done on gays.\n Kinsey studied homosexuals and pedophiles BEFORE homosexuality was removed from the DSM as a mental disorder.\n\n \n Was sodomy a felony? You STILL have studies done on pedophilia, so what? The fact is that more people are protective of children than they are of grown men that they don't know so homosexuality was easier to \"allow\". When a a parent hears about \"legalizing pedophilia\" they immediately thing about their kids being raped, even it the parental consent requirement is there. When the same kind of person heard about \"legalising homosexuality\" I bet they thought of the relatively few homosexuality who can make their own decisions and pose no threat to their children. Do you really think that society EVER saw the two as equally disgusting?\n \n \nYour requirement is pointless. There is no reason why a study on pedophilia can't be done in this country.\n All your requirement does is give you an excuse to ignore the studies that HAVE BEEN DONE in this country regarding pedophilia.\n\n \n I'll give you a reason. Practicing pedophilia is illegal so the outcome of the study will be skewed. Do you know how science works? You most eliminate all outside influences to have an unbiased study. It's like comparing an electric engined car to a combustion engined car and not allowing gas. Would that study be fair?\n \n \nOn another level, could you imagine if that while homosexuality was illegal, the vast majority of homosexual sexual encounters involved rape???\n If that WERE true, I WOULD consider homosexuality to be seriously in question.\n\n \n OK, but since you are gay you KNOW that it is not bad, pedophiles feel the same. Also, even if a minor consented(even if they have went through puberty and did so for the right reasons) it is still called rape. If EVERY homosexual relationship was considered rape, would you still trust the rape reports?\n \n \nWay to avoid the point of my analogy.\n\n \n The analogy is so flawed that it is not pertinent to our conversation.\n \n \nChoose whatever example you want. Choose a mosquito biting a child if you like. That would be nowhere near the inherent level of damage I am talking about, but rewrite the analogy WITH THE SAME POINT.\n And this time, address it.\n\n \n The chances being \"nearly zero\" are irrelevant. If there was \"nearly zero\" chance that I would die from smoking, there should still be a law against it.\n \n See, their is a chance that someone could get hurt, but we still give people a choice. The ultimate responsibility should is the parents and that is who should make the decision.\n \n \nNear Zero probability is not enough. You are still talking about a probability that something inherently detrimental will happen to the child, and have it be completely legal. Something a LOT more serious than a mosquito bite.\n\n \n You are forgetting the requirements, the child should make the choice for the right reasons and it is ultimately the parents responsibility. Many bad things happen as the result of bad parenting, we can not be every kids parents, at some point you have to let the parents PARENT. If they screw up, they pay the price. It's \"completely legal\" for children to die in car crashes, should we make cars illegal?\n \n \nI am gay.\n If I were the ONLY gay person on the planet, doomed to a life of being attracted to people who did not want to have sex with me, doomed to a life of being condemned by others for my *secret* desire, I WOULD NEVER RAPE another human being.\n I would not.\n\n \n Congratulations, you're not a rapist! You set up that question so that you take out all variables. There are rapists of every stripe, even gay, and they rape even if it's illegal. I'm sure you would never rape, but some do, should that reflect of you? If ALL gay sex was considered rape, would that make it bad? The bottom line is that is someone rapes, their sexual orientation does not matter, it don't matter if the like guys gals old women or children. they are rapists and they are a bad group of people, this does not reflect on any non-rapist including pedophiles. \n \n \nPeople live celibate lives all the time. Straight people go through dry spells. Boys go through puberty, one of the more \"horny\", and maintain their virginity. The stereo-typical nerd at the back of the class can feel attraction that isn't returned and not rape anyone.\n \n But as for pedophiles, they often DO NOT CONTAIN their desires to have sex with kids.\n They coerce. And they rape. And they force. And they make a kid do something against his will, and withhold that info from the parents.\n \n The point you are missing is this.\n Most of us in life go through stages where we are attracted, but are unable to have sex. We cope.\n Can you say the same about most pedophiles?\n\n \n Add anther one to your list. Pedophiles typically don't have sex with minors. You're going to say \"How do you know?\", common sense. Do you think that all pedophiles rape? Proof? You remember all of those examples you listed? Some people that fit those description DO rape, should we make a generalization and say that they tend to rape? I bet that most rapists are democrats, man democrats are rapists!\n \n \nYou are confusing a fundamental morality of having CONSENSUAL sex with a fundamental morality of RAPE.\n If sex was illegal, and all women refused to have sex, and most heterosexual men proceeded to rape women, THEN I would say that heterosexual males are obviously deranged.\n It IS NOT just that sex is illegal.\n It's the fact that they IGNORE the fact that their partner is unwilling, or that he/she was coerced, or ...\n \n You are missing a fundamental importance of CONSENT and what type of person ignores that consent and takes his sex despite a lack of consent.\n \n\n \n The law does not allow minors to consent, so who knows how many did? People that are attracted to adults rape even though adult sex IS legal, what does this say about people who are attracted to adults? I still don't understand why you groups them together. The fact is that some people do rape, this does not change with sexual preference.\n \n \nAt one time, it was unheard of to charge a man with raping his wife. It was just not a legal reality.\n EVEN THEN, when it is completely legal for a man to rape his wife, do you think that a man raping his wife is similar to a man having consensual sex with his wife?\n\n \n Do you think that I'm that sick?\n \n \n\n The \"legality\" is irrelevant. You are hung up on it. YOU have put it on a pedastal.\n The REASON it is illegal is for all the reasons I have mentioned. Illegality is the CONSEQUENCE of these bad things.\n It DOES NOT cause these bad things...\n\n \n The part I'm missing is the part that links sexual preference to rape. I bet more people rape adults than rape children, should we ban adult sex? You're going to say \"all pedophile sex is rape, that's why pedophilia is bad\". According to the law it is rape with consent or not, unlike any other sex, next point.\n \n \nI am identifying a disjoint here.\n A 9 year old IS NOT mature enough to have sex with an adult male.\n And let's not confuse the issue. The VAST majority of pedophiles are males. Not females.\n But getting back to the point, it DOES NOT MATTER if the parents think the kid is mature enough to play in traffic. If a parent thinks his/her kid should play in traffic if they want to, that parent is negligent and needs to be punished.\n\n \n Ah yess, the play in traffic analogy again.emoticon_wow What about sports? What if they are 10? 11? What age? See, you can make the choice!! Why not the parents? Also, it is legal for a parent to decide if their kid can play in traffic, THEY ALMOST ALWAYS MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION! If they don't they get punished.\n \n \nSee, THIS is part of the reason I have harped on \"puberty\" as a marker/distinguisher.\n THAT is the line I am drawing.\n Before puberty, completely wrong due to the inherent damage to the child.\n After puberty? That issue has more flexibility.\n \n\n \n OK, so as soon as they go through puberty even if it is 10-11? What inherent damage is there to the child if they are not being coerced and are not physically harmed? I know you will say, \"They have to be coerced, they are not interested at that age\", and your probably right, but answer the question.\n If you can make all of these decisions so easily, why can't the parents? They do in the \"playing in trafic\" sceanario.\n \n \n \nQuote:\n Originally Posted by bigj480\n Then perhaps you should start quantifying what you are talking about.\n Show examples where parents don't have a problem with a 9-year old having sex with a 30-year old man, who has fully informed the parent of his actions and intent and the 9-year old has exclusive control over the situation.\n \"show examples\"???\n I am baffled by your challenge.\n If there are NO examples, that is a good thing.\n If there is ONE example, then it should be illegal due to the inherent harm caused to the 9-year old.\n If there are NO examples, and it's illegal, then who cares? Nobody is in jail.\n If there is ONE example of a 9-year old as described above, that is one too many and the situation demands jail time.\n \n I don't mean this derogatorily, but do you comprehend that some things should be illegal even if there is little to no chance it could happen?\n A civilian man blowing a nuclear weapon in the desert should be illegal.\n Even if it doesn't happen, it should still be illegal.\n Now the reason why it is illegal could be diverse. Environmental pollution. Damage to the civilian population who breathe in the air.\n Maybe there is no law that says \"Individuals can't blow up a nuclear weapons in the desert\". But the act should STILL be illegal.\n\n \n See, I mistakingly copied your quote without quoting you. You would have disreagarded the examples even if I had found them, so why ask? Yeah, I understand your reasoning in that paragraph, I just don't reach the same conclusion. It's not my place to decide for the parents.\n \n \nI thought you claimed you had been to web-sites which talked about them.And as my e-mail is empty, I am taking it that you are not going to take me up on my request to show me these web-sites you previously talked about?\n\n \n I've already told you that they are pretty secretive and I can't blame them. I will NOT send you a link, if you want to find legal pedofilia boards you can, just look. You can start at the \"pro-pedo\" links at the bottom of the wiki article.",

   "\"I have read and understood that.\n What you don't seem to understand is that \"virtually eliminate\" is not sufficient for me. Just plain illegal. That is the only acceptable standard.\"\n That's fine, I just don't think that there needs to be a specific number. What number would you choose? Some girls have reached puberty at 11.\n\n If you don't pick a \"specific number\", then logically a specific number will not exist.\n Ergo, 8 is a legal number.\n 5 is a legal number.\n 3 is a legal number.\n You \"don't think\" there needs to be a specific number, but you can't seem to recognize what happens if that number doesn't exist...\n \n Moreover, I have given reasons why it SHOULD BE illegal.\n You really haven't given any reasons why it should be legal for a man to have sex with a 5-year old.\n \n \n \nI understand, you don't like pedophilia, it also seems strange to me. I don't think it would be a problem if parental consent was required but I know that that's not definitive.\n\n As we have discussed, parental consent IS NOT ENOUGH in cases where the child is too young.\n A parent can consent, the child could \"give consent\" in a manner that a lawyer could persuade a jury is legal, and then what are we left with?\n My question to you is how the heck can you think a parent \"giving consent\" for a five year old to have sex should be legal???\n \n \n \nYeah, the confusion is mainly my fault. However, I do think that they are related, you want an age of consent to stop pedophilia. I just don't like \"extra\" laws and I really think that the AOC laws aren't necessary.\n\n The documented harm caused to pedophilia victims demonstrates your claim is false.\n \n \n \nEvery time you said \"victim of pedophilia\". Like I said, pedophilia is merely an adults attraction to prepubesent children.\n\n Your objection is inane.\n If I talk about \"rape victim\", does that mean I'm talking about a woman who hasn't been raped?\n Or a woman that HAS BEEN raped?\n \n Obviously, a woman who HAS BEEN raped.\n Likewise, a pedophilia victim is somebody who has been subjected to pedophilia. Whether it be pedophilia rape, or pedophilia advances, or pedophilia whatever.\n \n \n \nYou repeat this over and over again, and it's just plain false.\n A man raping a woman IS AN EXAMPLE of heterosexuality.\n A man raping a child IS AN EXAMPLE of pedophilia.\n\n \nYou really think this? I think that they are both examples of what evil some are capable of and that they do not have any bearing on the way we should think of most heterosexuals or pedophiles.\n\n Wow. Ain't that just pretty. And completely desiring to overlook the facts.\n \n A man raping a woman IS an example of heterosexuality. It is an EVIL example of heterosexuality, but it is still an example of heterosexuality.\n The \"bearing\" would be only evaluated intelligently if taken into context of the big picture. HOW OFTEN is heterosexuality demonstrated by rape? How many examples of heterosexuality are not rape? THAT is how you would judge the overall picture.\n \n Pedophilia rape is also an example of pedophilia. It IS an evil example of pedophilia, but it is still an example of pedophilia.\n The \"bearing\" would be only evaluated intelligently if taken into context of the big picture. HOW OFTEN is pedophilia demonstrated by rape? How many examples of pedophilia are not rape? THAT is how you would judge the overall picture.\n \n Your desire to not look at the big picture doesn't make sense. If the poor has a higher infant mortality rate, we shouldn't just overlook that but look to the CAUSE of the situation.\n You, for some bizarre reason, refuse to see the evil aspects of pedophilia. You create excuses to not acknowledge that the evil aspects of pedophilia are significant. You refuse to explore that significance.\n This is not logical, unless you are looking to ignore the facts.\n \n \n \nIf adult sex was made illegal tomorrow and everyone who was even talked to in a sexual manner or suspected that two people might be engaging in sex reported it to the police and the perpetrator would go to jail, basically picture adult sex as hated and illegal as adult-child sex. Do you think their would be any arrests? I bet that rapes would sky rocket and the only time you would hear about adult sex would be in a negative light.\n\n Wow oh Wow oh Wow oh WOW! You have such an active imagination.\n Take homosexuality as an example. The ridicule and scorn and illegal pressure that homosexuals had to endure.\n Did the homosexual \"rape\" rate just \"sky-rocket\"???\n \n Quit with the b.s. Your fantasies are inane. Most heterosexuals can contain themselves if they don't have any opposite gender outlet.\n The same cannot be said of pedophiles.\n \n Your fantasies do not change anything.\n And if you think you are going to convince anybody of the legitimacy of pedophiles, who have frequent rape rates, by claiming that heterosexuals would resort to rape if heterosexual sex is illegal, then you are just plain delusional.\n \n Are you a heterosexual or a homosexual or a bisexual?\n If so, and your sex was illegal, would you rape people as an outlet???\n \n \n \nSo would that make it right to assume that adult sex is bad? \n\n I am not assuming that pedophilia sex is bad.\n I have PROVEN that pedophilia sex is bad. Studies PROVE that it is bad.\n \n \n \nAfter all, you would only hear about adult sex when it involved rape.\n\n Another false assumption.\n Again, take homosexuals as an example.\n How much homosexual rape did you hear about when sodomy was illegal, and a person could easily lose their job for being outed?\n \n \n \nIt's like having a barrel of apples and a barrel of oranges.\n 99% of the apples are worm-free. Ergo, we shouldn't blindly throw out the apple barrel.\n 99.9...% of the oranges are infected with disease. In fact, I'm still waiting to see an orange which doesn't have a disease.\n Ergo, it makes sense to throw out the orange barrel.\n\n \nThat is a terrible analogy, that's like comparing apples to oranges.:) It's more like having an examiner (media) that hates oranges(pedophiles) and loves apples(sexually \"normal\" people) go through the apples and oranges and bring back 100 to document for a customer(society) who also hates oranges and wants them destroyed.\n\n So back up your claim.\n Provide the counter examples.\n SHOW the good examples of pedophilia.\n \n Until then, all this whining about victimization of pedophiles is inane and just plain fallacious.\n \n \n \nThe parents should be smart enough to know that full sex would be harmful and they should make sure that Chris has Johnny's best interest at heart and will no harm him.\n\n \"should be\" is not always the case.\n And what happens if \"should be\" is actually a case of \"wasn't\"?\n What then?\n \n What do we charge a parent with if little Johnny is hurt by Chris's johnson?\n What if the parents argue to the court that Chris's johnson was so small that they reasonably expected it wouldn't hurt little Johnny?\n \n Let me know exactly how the legal scenario would play out in your world?\n \n Because in your world, the laws and their protection of children would be significantly neutered. Pedophiles who could smooth talk their way enough (and from all evidence, they are experts at it) could make little Johnny think it was all his idea, and persuade the parents that it was a good idea. And then the pedophile could move onto a new victim afterwards.\n What would we charge the pedophile with if Johnny is physically hurt?",

   "I liken this to a parent who doesn't mind if his kid plays in sports. As adults, it is our right to allow children to do things that they want to if no harm results.\n\n And what if harm does result?\n What are the parties charged with?\n \n \n \nShould we eliminate all of the choices we allow parents to make so that we cant pick the best for the child? What about parents who overfeed their children? What about parents who allow their kids to fail in school? These can have very bad effects on the rest of the child's life! Why do you choose the age of 8 and 39? What's the difference between a 20 YO and a 39 YO?\n\n 1) No.\n 2) As for the rest of your statements, if you can find ANY study which claims that ANY of these things are anywhere near similar to the effects of pedophilia on kids, THEN we can talk.\n Until then, YOU are the one trying to compare apples to oranges.\n There is a difference between pedophilia and a child over-eating.\n \n \n \nYou STILL have studies done on pedophilia, so what?\n\n Gee. I have studies on pedophilia backing up my statements.\n All the excuses you make about why you can't provide pedophilia studies are frequently shown as false, and others conduct studies despite your excuses.\n The \"so what\" is that your excuses are false, and your hypothetical claims are disproven.\n \n \n \nThe fact is that more people are protective of children than they are of grown men that they don't know so homosexuality was easier to \"allow\".\n\n \"homosexuality\" involved willing and consenting partners.\n \"pedophilia\" involves adult men who rape kids. Of course people \"are protective of children\" against men who rape them when the men don't care about consent.\n \n \"Homosexuality\" typically involves people who will NOT rape if consent doesn't exist.\n So the \"protective of children\" is based on issues that you keep wanting to deny are representative of pedophilia.\n \n \n \nWhen a a parent hears about \"legalizing pedophilia\" they immediately thing about their kids being raped, even it the parental consent requirement is there. When the same kind of person heard about \"legalising homosexuality\" I bet they thought of the relatively few homosexuality who can make their own decisions and pose no threat to their children. Do you really think that society EVER saw the two as equally disgusting?\n\n Raping a kid, and two consenting adults doing their own thing?\n Of course they are not \"equally\" disgusting.\n And for the record, the reason pedophilia is illegal is not based on \"disgusting\".\n In fact, court rulings have expressly forbidden laws based on moral disapproval of a group.\n \n \n \nI'll give you a reason. Practicing pedophilia is illegal so the outcome of the study will be skewed. Do you know how science works? You most eliminate all outside influences to have an unbiased study. It's like comparing an electric engined car to a combustion engined car and not allowing gas. Would that study be fair?\n\n Which brings us back to reality.\n Homosexuality DID PROVIDE examples where it was illegal and frowned upon, but consensual gay sex which didn't harm anybody existed.\n You claim examples of that exist for pedophilia, but you continue to fail to produce any. With homosexuality illegal, we still found examples and case studiesof homosexuality.\n But with pedophilia, you cannot produce a single one.\n \n As I explained earlier, it would be REALLY easy for \"consenting pedophilia\" people to come forward when they were an adult and say \"I was a consenting participant in pedophilia when I was 8. My parents knew about it. It was my idea.\"\n But these people are nowhere to be found. It would be perfectly legal for them to do this. The pedophilia \"child\" has broken no laws.\n And the significance of that just doesn't phase your awareness.\n \n \n \nOK, but since you are gay you KNOW that it is not bad, pedophiles feel the same. Also, even if a minor consented(even if they have went through puberty and did so for the right reasons) it is still called rape. If EVERY homosexual relationship was considered rape, would you still trust the rape reports?\n\n Can you show me any pedophilia cases involving pre-pubescent kids which were not rape?\n No?\n Then stop comparing apples and oranges.\n \n \n \nThe chances being \"nearly zero\" are irrelevant. If there was \"nearly zero\" chance that I would die from smoking, there should still be a law against it.\n\n For an adult, no. Because the adult understands the risks.\n For a cihld, the damage to the child's health is significant. Tobacco has addictive qualities as well, and their incapability to make a mature decision regarding the detriments points to the illegal nature for cihldren.\n \n \n \nSee, their is a chance that someone could get hurt, but we still give people a choice. The ultimate responsibility should is the parents and that is who should make the decision.\n\n So by your logic, if a parent wants to allow their kid to get hurt, then that should be allowable.\n Sounds Great!\n \n \n \nYou are forgetting the requirements, the child should make the choice for the right reasons and it is ultimately the parents responsibility. Many bad things happen as the result of bad parenting, we can not be every kids parents, at some point you have to let the parents PARENT. If they screw up, they pay the price. It's \"completely legal\" for children to die in car crashes, should we make cars illegal?\n\n Apples and oranges.\n If a child is the victim of pedophilia, there is a 100% chance that will damage him psychologically and/or physically.\n In a car, if there is a car wreck, there is not a 100% chance that he will be killed. Moreover, we reduce those chances by requiring car seats.\n \n \n \nI'm sure you would never rape, but some do, should that reflect of you?\n\n If EVERY example of homosexuality was rape, and EVERY example of homosexuality was found to damage the participant, then yes. It would reflect on me.\n \n \n \nIf ALL gay sex was considered rape, would that make it bad?\n\n It's not an issue of \"considered rape\".\n It's an issue of EVERY EXAMPLE WE SEE is rape, and you cannot come up with any example that is not rape.\n \n \n \nAdd anther one to your list. Pedophiles typically don't have sex with minors. You're going to say \"How do you know?\", common sense. Do you think that all pedophiles rape? Proof? You remember all of those examples you listed? Some people that fit those description DO rape, should we make a generalization and say that they tend to rape? I bet that most rapists are democrats, man democrats are rapists!\n\n This is a lot of nonsense.\n If EVERY example we had of a democrat having sex was rape, and NO example could be shown where it wasn't rape, then YES. It WOULD reflect poorly on democrats.\n \n Your \"common sense\" reply is nonsense.\n Do I think that all pedophiles rape? No. Not all.\n But here are the facts I have on hand. EVERY example of pedophile activity I have involves rape. I have NO example of non-pedophile rape.\n So it is logical to see that when a pedophile DOES act on their sexual desires, they DO NOT CARE about consent.\n \n \n \nThe law does not allow minors to consent, so who knows how many did?\n\n Again, this comes down to a refusal to look at the facts.\n WE CAN ASK THE MINORS. \n We can CONDUCT STUDIES on the minors.\n Take the studies involved in this thread. They ASKED THE MINORS QUESTIONS about their experience.\n Gezus! This is just mind-boggling!\n \n \n \nDo you think that I'm that sick?\n\n Care to elaborate?\n \n \n \nThe part I'm missing is the part that links sexual preference to rape. I bet more people rape adults than rape children, should we ban adult sex? You're going to say \"all pedophile sex is rape, that's why pedophilia is bad\". According to the law it is rape with consent or not, unlike any other sex, next point.\n\n How about ADDRESSING the point. \"According to law\" is irrelevant.\n Every example of pedophilia involves that we have involves a child who DID NOT GIVE CONSENT. Your allegation of the \"law\" is irrelevant and conveniently tries to side-step the issue.\n \n \n \nAh yess, the play in traffic analogy again.emoticon_wow What about sports? What if they are 10? 11? What age? See, you can make the choice!! Why not the parents? Also, it is legal for a parent to decide if their kid can play in traffic, THEY ALMOST ALWAYS MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION! If they don't they get punished.\n\n Yes. Let's bring up sports.\n Say an 8-year old wants to play a \"sport\" of having sex with Chris. Kids sometimes get hurt in sports. It's to be expected.\n So what do we charge the parents with? What do we charge the \"coach\" Chris with?\n \n You claim \"they get punished\", but I'm curious precisely how you think they will be punished.\n \n \n \nI've already told you that they are pretty secretive and I can't blame them. I will NOT send you a link, if you want to find legal pedofilia boards you can, just look.

I offer to help, you refuse to follow-up.\n \n The only link you do come forward with to try and respond to an \"perverted-justice.com\".\n Incidentally, the reason I thought you would like that web-site is because you can look at their dialogue, and UNILATERALLY see them talk about wanting to have sex with these kids WITHOUT THE PARENTS KNOWLEDGE.\n I thought you supported preventing that...",

   "If you don't pick a \"specific number\", then logically a specific number will not exist.\n Ergo, 8 is a legal number.\n 5 is a legal number.\n 3 is a legal number.\n You \"don't think\" there needs to be a specific number, but you can't seem to recognize what happens if that number doesn't exist...\n\n \n You do realise that I am still talking about the parental consent law scenario, right? List all of the \"legal numbers\" you want, but numbers have nothing to do with the scenario. The bottom line is that anyone who harms a child or allows them to be harmed would still go to jail. If the child is not harmed no one would be arrested. Most of the ages you just listed would probably land someone in jail. \n \n -Does the child want to have sexual contact for the wrong reasons?\n -Would the child be harmed by the experience?\n \n If any of the answers to the preceding questions were \"yes\" and the child was allowed to proceed anyway the parents and the partner would go to jail. Offenders could be put on a list so people could know if a person is an offender, just like now. If you want to argue against my \"parental consent\" scenario give me an example where the answer to both of the questions above would be no but it would still be a bad idea.\n \n It's humorous that you quote me when I say \"think\", like that makes my arguments less valid. How do you process your thoughts? If you \"think\" that you are always right they must be divinely processed. I know, you will say \"I have facts to back up my argument, that makes your argument inane\". People on both sides of most arguments can \"prove\" the other party wrong with statistics, this often happens in presidential debates, does this mean that both candidates are wrong? The both have FACTS to back them up! Can you at least agree that most of the studies on pedophilia are really studying child rape or sexual abuse?\n \n \n \nMoreover, I have given reasons why it SHOULD BE illegal.\n You really haven't given any reasons why it should be legal for a man to have sex with a 5-year old.\n\n \n Show me were I said that \"it should be legal for a man to have sex with a 5-year old\". I have not. I HAVE said that if a child is harmed the offenders should go to jail. IF you are right and all pedophilia is harmful then nothing would change except some teenagers having sex with the parents consent. Pedophiles would still go to jail, if you are right, and this would eliminate many ridiculous state laws that make it legal for a couple to have sex in one state and not another.\n \n \nAs we have discussed, parental consent IS NOT ENOUGH in cases where the child is too young.\n A parent can consent, the child could \"give consent\" in a manner that a lawyer could persuade a jury is legal, and then what are we left with?\n My question to you is how the heck can you think a parent \"giving consent\" for a five year old to have sex should be legal?\n\n \n Your right, parental consent is not enough, I have never said that it was. The child should also have to visit at least two professionals who are qualified to determine if the child fully comprehends what they are consenting to and if the child is being coerced or making the choice for the wrong reasons. Maybe there could be a list of sexual acts with the age at which a child could safely participate in them. The bottom line is that if you eliminate the risk of physical harm and psychological harm, not harm is done. So why should it be illegal?\n \n \n \n \nThe documented harm caused to pedophilia victims demonstrates your claim is false.\n\n \n OK, I'm not responding to anymore statements about \"pedophilia victims\". It's not because I am pro-pedophilia, it's because I KNOW that no one can be a victim of pedophilia and I can back it up with FACT!\n \n \n \n \nYour objection is inane.\n If I talk about \"rape victim\", does that mean I'm talking about a woman who hasn't been raped?\n Or a woman that HAS BEEN raped?\n\n \n Your logic is inane.\n Of coarse I understand what a rape victim is, I don't know what a homosexuality or heterosexuality victim is though. Could you tell me? I must be ignorant, I always thought that they were rape victims. Could you tell the media and everyone else on the earth while your at it?\n \n \nObviously, a woman who HAS BEEN raped.\n Likewise, a pedophilia victim is somebody who has been subjected to pedophilia. Whether it be pedophilia rape, or pedophilia advances, or pedophilia whatever.\n\n \n Man, I have been the victim of heterosexuality MANY times! I've even been the victim of homosexuality! Should I call the police? :xbanghead \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWow. Ain't that just pretty. And completely desiring to overlook the facts.\n \n A man raping a woman IS an example of heterosexuality. It is an EVIL example of heterosexuality, but it is still an example of heterosexuality.\n The \"bearing\" would be only evaluated intelligently if taken into context of the big picture. HOW OFTEN is heterosexuality demonstrated by rape? How many examples of heterosexuality are not rape? THAT is how you would judge the overall picture.\n \n Pedophilia rape is also an example of pedophilia. It IS an evil example of pedophilia, but it is still an example of pedophilia.\n The \"bearing\" would be only evaluated intelligently if taken into context of the big picture. HOW OFTEN is pedophilia demonstrated by rape? How many examples of pedophilia are not rape? THAT is how you would judge the overall picture.\n\n \n That's a fine way to judge the overall picture! Hey most crime is committed by African-American males even though they are a minority! This must mean the black males are inherently more prone to criminals! Obviously this is not the case, that is how you must look at it though.\n \n \nYour desire to not look at the big picture doesn't make sense. If the poor has a higher infant mortality rate, we shouldn't just overlook that but look to the CAUSE of the situation.\n\n \n So you think that the cause of child rape is pedophilia so that means ALL pedophiles are evil. If we follow that logic hunger, not a lack of self-control, causes people to be overweight. Sexual attraction must cause rape too, everyone is sexually attracted to someone, I wonder why everyone hasn't raped someone. Wow, I'm attracted to lots of people, I wonder why I haven't raped anyone. I'm so glad that you can tell what I desire over the Internet! What do I desire now?........................................Nope, It's cheesecake!:) \n \n \nYou, for some bizarre reason, refuse to see the evil aspects of pedophilia. You create excuses to not acknowledge that the evil aspects of pedophilia are significant. You refuse to explore that significance.\n This is not logical, unless you are looking to ignore the facts.\n\n \n Man, you are seeing right through me, I refuse to see the negative aspects of pedophilia and I LOVE to ignore facts. I love to get on the Internet to prove a point that I know is false, it makes my day! Yepp, that's exactly what I do.emoticon_confused I have stated that some rapists do prefer children, do you remember that? Some also prefer adults, males, females, she-males, fat people, skinny people, tall people, short people, blacks, whites, Asians, Mexicans, Indians, native Americans, disabled people, rich people, poor people........What's your point? I know, people who are attracted to any of those groups are evil! Am I right? That's it! You can not be attracted to any of those groups if you are not evil or at least you are more prone to be evil.\n \n \n \nWow oh Wow oh Wow oh WOW! You have such an active imagination.\n Take homosexuality as an example. The ridicule and scorn and illegal pressure that homosexuals had to endure.\n Did the homosexual \"rape\" rate just \"sky-rocket\"???\n\n \n Honestly, go you think that homosexuality was ever as hated or illegal as adult-child sex? emoticon_xdonno Nope. It's MUCH more accepted and has been for a long time, even when illegal. Did most homosexuals have someone constantly looking for signs of homosexuality with them all the time just waiting to call police if the see the signs? Nope. If homosexuality was illegal do you think it would be just as hard to have a homosexual relationship as it is to ave an adult-minor sexual relationship? Nope. Do you not think that the rape cases would sky-rocket if the scenario above was true? The sad thing is that child rapists have nothing to do with our conversation but you keep adding them. They would go to jail, just as they do today, so your argument is \"inane\".I'm glad you liked my question, I know how you like hypothetical.\n \n \nQuit with the b.s. Your fantasies are inane. Most heterosexuals can contain themselves if they don't have any opposite gender outlet.\n The same cannot be said of pedophiles.\n\n \n Prove it. Find out how many non-acting pedophiles there are. It's just as easy as finding all of the facts you want me to find( which you have already stated that you would dis-regard even if found).\n \n Your fantasies do not change anything.\n And if you think you are going to convince anybody of the legitimacy of pedophiles, who have frequent rape rates, by claiming that heterosexuals would resort to rape if heterosexual sex is illegal, then you are just plain delusional.\n \n Ahh yes, all of my fantasies, this one is my favorite! In this fantasy people use logic and are open-minded! I know, it's far fetched.emoticon_xgood If you eliminate physical and emotional harm, how can one be hurt?\n \n \nAre you a heterosexual or a homosexual or a bisexual?\n If so, and your sex was illegal, would you rape people as an outlet???\n\n \n None of your business! I'm try-sexual.emoticon_xangel \n What an insult! From my posts you could not determine what my answer would be? Of coarse not, I would never rape anyone! What you must realise is that there are some in EVERY group who would. I want to state, again, child rapists are not demonstrative of most pedophiles. Prove me wrong.\n \n \nI am not assuming that pedophilia sex is bad.\n I have PROVEN that pedophilia sex is bad. Studies PROVE that it is bad.\n\n \n Show me.\n \n \nAnother false assumption.\n Again, take homosexuals as an example.\n How much homosexual rape did you hear about when sodomy was illegal, and a person could easily lose their job for being outed?\n\n \n I don't need a history lesson, answer the question as stated. It's a lot easier to hide a homosexual relationship and it is legally possible to consent to the sex. Apples and oranges. If I had a relationship with a minor that was as much like your relationship as possible it would still be rape, even withe the whole family consenting and no one being harmed. It's easy to make something look bad when you have a double standard. Also, what would be the punishment for homosexual sex back then? Was it a felony and were you put on a list and made to tell your whole neighborhood? Reply to this one.\n \n \n \n \n \nSo back up your claim.\n Provide the counter examples.\n SHOW the good examples of pedophilia.\n \n Until then, all this whining about victimization of pedophiles is inane and just plain fallacious.\n\n \n OK, I will, right after you show me how many non-acting pedophiles there are in the US. Until then, all this whining about pedophiles being inherently evil is inane and just plain fallacious.\n \n \n \n \n\"should be\" is not always the case.\n And what happens if \"should be\" is actually a case of \"wasn't\"?\n What then?\n\n \n Jail time.\n \n \nWhat do we charge a parent with if little Johnny is hurt by Chris's johnson?\n What if the parents argue to the court that Chris's johnson was so small that they reasonably expected it wouldn't hurt little Johnny?\n \n Let me know exactly how the legal scenario would play out in your world?\n\n \n Charge the parents with the same crime that we charge Chris with. You could have a list of sexual acts physically possible at different ages and anyone who does anything different would be held responsible if the child is harmed.\n \n \nBecause in your world, the laws and their protection of children would be significantly neutered.\n\n \n Nope, harm = prison, what more do you want?\n \n \nPedophiles who could smooth talk their way enough (and from all evidence, they are experts at it) could make little Johnny think it was all his idea, and persuade the parents that it was a good idea. And then the pedophile could move onto a new victim afterwards.\n What would we charge the pedophile with if Johnny is physically hurt?\n\n \n Do you really think that CHILD RAPISTS have that kind of power over adults? Could they smooth talk you? Of coarse not, but you are smarter that most adults, hence the \"nanny state\" is needed.emoticon_xdonno We could charge the CHILD ABUSER with whatever is deemed reasonable, we could even make a new classification. What would you suggest? \n \n I have noticed that you pick and choose which parts of my posts to reply to, could you start relying to everything(as I do)? I will reply to your other post tomorrow, unless you post another one, then the old one will be disregarded. I hope you give me a chance to reply to it first though. Hopefully my stupid cable company will stop screwing up my intronetzz.emoticon_mad",

   "First, the issue of \"studies\" was brought up, and bigj requested I supply some more. Ergo, the following post.\n \n http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/articles/020422/archive_020643.htm\n The first link is to refute a general presumption that the stigma against pedophilia in this country is so bad, that we cannot do research upon pedophilia. The article discusses people that have done research on the issue of pedophilia, and that those who \"champion\" the pedophilia cause do exist, and they are being given a podium to speak at.\n For example: \"Here's an example of the terrain change. For more than 20 years, pedophile advocate Tom O'Carroll has been a stigmatized outsider. Now he has been invited to address an international sex convention in Paris on the subject of privacy rights of pedophiles and their child partners (or targets). His pro-pedophilia book is on a course list at Cambridge University.\"\n \n So bigj, your excuses for why you cannot come up with research to substantiate your claims are proven false on multiple levels.\n \n http://www.prtc.net/~morality/porno/research.htmReport of the U.S. Congress Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on Child Pornography and Pedophilia (1986) \n \n \"No single characteristic of pedophilia is more pervasive than the obsession with child pornography. The fascination of pedophiles with child pornography and child abuse has been documented in many studies and has been established by hundreds of sexually explicit materials involving children. \n \"Detective William Dworin of the Los Angeles Police Department estimates that of the 700 child molesters in whose arrest he has participated during the last ten years, more than half had child pornography in their possession. About 80 percent owned either child or adult pornography. \n \n Child pornography plays a central role in child molestations by pedophiles, serving to justify their conduct, assist them in seducing their victims, and provide a means to blackmail the children they have molested in order to prevent exposure.\n And out of curiousity, this new-found capability you're granting children at any age to \"consent\" to sex, does that include nude photography as well?\n If a \"child requests\" that he be photographed in the nude, and the parents are willing (or perhaps behind the camera itself), does that mean that it's all perfectly legal?\n \n \n http://radiance.m6.net/myrrh/doc-effect.html\n A study by Debra K. Peters and Lillian M. Range found significant differences between contact and non-contact child sexual abuse (distinctions that for statistical purposes the Rind study ignores): \n Further, a consistent finding was that women and men whose sexual abuse involved touching were more suicidal, less able to cope, and felt less responsible to their families than nonabused students. Adults whose sexual abuse was exploitative but involved no touch were not significantly different from nonabused adults. The experience of being touched in a sexual way appears to be more damaging than other kinds of unwanted sexual experiences. ...15 Steven M. Mirin, M.D., medical director for the American Psychiatric Association, stated that his organization \"strongly disagrees with the conclusion of the Rind study \"that not all sexual contact between adult and child should be considered abusive.\" He explained, \n [F]rom a psychological perspective, sex between adults and child[ren] is always abusive and exploitative because the adult always holds the power in the relationship and the child does not. Such exploitation destroys the child's trust that the adults in his or her life will not harm [him or her].16 \n I could list more, but I really don't see the point, as:\n a) The claim is NOT being refuted by any science, studies, or facts.\n b) The claim is ACCEPTED as truth by the experts involved in these fields. and\n c) You think all the above is inherently flawed anyways by a laundry list of refuted excuses, and you won't even really acknowledge what I do post.",

I have not. I HAVE said that if a child is harmed the offenders should go to jail.\n\n < head scratcher <\n You want to remove all age of consent laws, and allow a \"case-by-case\" type basis for what pedophilia / man/child sexual contact is legal and not legal...\n ... and it is currently ILLEGAL for a man to have sex with a 5-year old under legislation that YOU want to revoke...\n ... and you complain about my statement. emoticon_confused \n \n Under the current situation, it is illegal for a man to have sex with a 5-year old.\n Under YOUR scenario, SOME cases of a man having sex with a 5-year old would be illegal. SOME cases would be legal.\n The line would be debated in a court of law based on concepts of \"was the child harmed\"...\n Concepts of \"did the child consent\"...\n \n My statement was entirely accurate and truthful.\n Your reply pointless.\n \n \n \nIF you are right and all pedophilia is harmful then nothing would change except some teenagers having sex with the parents consent. Pedophiles would still go to jail, if you are right, and this would eliminate many ridiculous state laws that make it legal for a couple to have sex in one state and not another.\n\n 1) I reiterate this because you didn't answer last time.\n I want the SPECIFIC CRIME you claim the pedophile would go to jail under with your scenario. There is no statute on the books of \"Chris harmed little Johnny\". There are multiple cases where \"harming\" a child is completely legal.\n 2) I also want the SPECIFIC CRIME you claim the parents would go to jail under with your scenario. There is no statute on the books of \"Little Johnny got harmed due to something the parents consented to\". There are multiple cases where this would be completely legal. Sports would be one perfect example.\n \n \n \nYour right, parental consent is not enough, I have never said that it was. The child should also have to visit at least two professionals who are qualified to determine if the child fully comprehends what they are consenting to and if the child is being coerced or making the choice for the wrong reasons.\n\n Oh. Well why didn't you say so then.\n Considering the \"professionals\" that are currently out there consistently and virtually universally acknowledge the harm, this moots the whole issue.\n The end effect of the law is virtually the same.\n < end sarcasm <\n \n Wait a tick. You said that the child should have to visit \"at least two professionals\". Ergo, if these two SPECIFIC professionals claim that the child will not be harmed, the fun can commence. And I'm sure that the pedophile in mind will obviously be looking for a main-stream \"professional\" and not resort to picking a SPECIFIC professional who may be renowned for claiming that the child won't be \"harmed\"...\n \n Naw. That would NEVER happen...\n < Okay. REALLY ending sarcasm <\n \n \n \nMaybe there could be a list of sexual acts with the age at which a child could safely participate in them. The bottom line is that if you eliminate the risk of physical harm and psychological harm, not harm is done. So why should it be illegal?\n\n 1) Such a \"list\" already exists. It's called the \"Age of Consent\" laws.\n It incorporates the fact that two professionals (heck, actually a whole phone book of professionals) acknowledge that the child will be harmed. It gives an \"age\" at which a child can safely participate.\n \n 2) I love how you toss off ideals that you cling to BUT HAVE NEVER PROVIDED ANY PROOF for. \"eliminate the risk of physical and psychological harm\"...\n I'm still waiting for you to PROVE that...\n \n \n \nOK, I'm not responding to anymore statements about \"pedophilia victims\". It's not because I am pro-pedophilia, it's because I KNOW that no one can be a victim of pedophilia and I can back it up with FACT!\n\n Oh gee. You not responding to my arguments.\n There's a new twist...\n < end sarcasm <\n \n Just out of curiousity, do you realize that this \"approach\" of yours will allow my statements to go completely unchecked?\n \n \n \nYour logic is inane.\n Of coarse I understand what a rape victim is, I don't know what a homosexuality or heterosexuality victim is though. Could you tell me? I must be ignorant, I always thought that they were rape victims. Could you tell the media and everyone else on the earth while your at it?\n\n This approach of yours is rather mundane.\n Food poisoning.\n Not all food poisons. But some does. Does that mean we don't call it \"food poisoning\", but rather strictly refer to it as \"bad spinach poisoning\"?\n No. We call it \"food poisoning\" because we acknowledge that SOME food poisons.\n Do we insist that the food that DOES poison not be referred to as \"food\"? Of course not. Because we're all intelligent enough to realize that SOME food poisons.\n \n Likewise, your complaints about heterosexual rape and homosexual rape and pedophilia rape are inane. SOME heterosexuals rape. SOME pedophiles rape.\n To refuse to call it \"heterosexual\" rape, or to refuse to acknowledge that it IS an example of \"pedophilia\" is inane.\n \n And to your question, if you can show me any news media which claims that a heterosexual rape isn't an example of \"heterosexuality\" (Again, an ATYPICAL example, but an example nonetheless), I welcome it.",

   "\"would probably\" land someone in jail?\n THAT is the point. The exceptions that you want to create, and the damage that it creates.\n\n \n Yes, there is a chance that an offender would get away, but it's unlikely. I could have easily said that they would go to jail given the \"parental consent\" scenario, but I realise that the courts are not perfect. How do we remove all doubt? Do you think that every offender goes to jail now? Nope. So this whole argument that there is a chance that an offender could avoid jail is useless, it happens now.\n \n \nAnd of course, under your scenario, these questions would be \"answered\" in a court of law, where both sides would get up and debate what are \"wrong reasons\"?\n\n \n What's your point? Do you not trust a jury of your peers? If not you should want to do away with the whole judicial system. Let me guess, you could decide but you don't trust others to do the same. What do you call that high horse of yours? You seem to think that the parents and jurors of this nation are a bunch of XXXXXX when compared to you, I guess I am to.\n \n \nWhat is \"harm\"? How much \"harm\" is necessary before we can convict? \n\n \n You don't know what \"harm\" means or how much harm is necessary for you to convict?!? Of coarse you do, but it's the XXXXXX you are worried about again, right? They wont be able to make the right choice, will they?\n \n \nWhat if the pedophile can mount a \"persuasive\" argument that no reasonable person could have expected the \"harm\" that the prosecution claims exists?\\\n\n \n \n Oh noozzz, WHAT IF! I'm scared! A persuasive argument? That's scary! I don't know if we have the wits to see through the lie! You mean that the pedophile MIGHT be able to convince a jury that the harm to a child was unforeseeable in his case? Most jurors would convict anyway, see \"Jury nullification\". If the defendant proves his case you would still want to convict them? This post is really showing your hate of the judicial system and Due process! Maybe you should be the judge, jury and executioner of the sick pedophiles who prove their cases! That would be perfect, wouldn't it? Are you a republican? You seem like someone from the \"Moral majority\".\n \n \nYou're asking to open the door, and you don't even realize the flies you are letting in....\n\n \n I know, I want to \"allow\" doctors, psychologists and parents to decide what is best for their kids and jurrors to decide what is against the law. MAN, I'm a radical! That would be horrible!emoticon_xdonno \n \n \nAgain I ask, WHAT CRIME would they be guilty of under your situation?\n Under the current law, they would be guilty of \"child molestation\".\n Under your law, please name the EXACT CRIME they would be supposedly charged with. Would you claim they would be guilty of \"assault\"? \"Child endangerment\"?\n \n Please. Name the SPECIFIC crime.\n\n \n OK, I will decide what I think would be justified, that doesn't mean that it is the only way to go. I think that the child abuser should be charged with the same crime they are charged with now. The parents could be charged with being an \"accomplice to XXXX\", XXXX could be anything from \"child molestation\" to \"rape of a minor\", depending on the crime committed. The \"accomplice to XXXX\" charges should carry the same penalties as the crime it's self.\n \n \nThat's a rather bizarre question, as I am saying that the very nature of what you are suggesting is \"wrong\", ergo there would be an inherent \"yes\" to the \"right reasons\" question...\n ... and my stance is that the child is inherently \"harmed\" by being involved with pedophilia, and thus the second question's answer would also be an inherent \"yes\".\n\n \n Then what is there to fear?\n \n \nI have been asking YOU to give REAL LIFE examples where the answer to both questions is \"no\", but that is something you fail to do.\n Did you forget who is on which side?\n\n \n Nope, I did not forget. Could you find the info? Nope. Neither can I, the fact that I can't has no bearing on the argument IMO. No one is going to report a case like that and it would be kept secret, so it's imposable to find. I'll look later though.\n \n \nActually, I believe my point was that you are JUST \"thinking\" these issues...\n ... just HYPOTHESIZING these issues ...\n ... and not even bothering to check if your hypothesis have any real life examples.\n\n \n Yeah, statistics < logical thought, right? \"So all the offenders would be punished and harm would not be allowed?(logic) Oh, but look at all of the evil pedophiles!(statistics)\"\n \n \nI am amused by how you glibbly gloss over the fact that this IS NOT an argument where both sides can \"prove\" the other party wrong with statistics.\n I have proven YOU wrong with facts and statistics.\n You don't have any.\n\n \n Yeah, nice sidestep, but it doesnt matter. If one party comes to the debate without statistics but with a logical argument to the contrary, does this disprove their logical argument? Let me ask you a hypothetical question. IF there were a lot of pedophiles who keep their attraction secret and never act on it, would it be easy to count how many there was? Nope, 'nuff said.\n \n \n< head scratcher <\n You want to remove all age of consent laws, and allow a \"case-by-case\" type basis for what pedophilia / man/child sexual contact is legal and not legal...\n ... and it is currently ILLEGAL for a man to have sex with a 5-year old under legislation that YOU want to revoke...\n ... and you complain about my statement. emoticon_confused\n \n \n You are correct, I would revoke that law and give the power to decide to people who are actually knowledgeable about human sexual relations, psychology, child development and safe sex and to the parents. This does not mean the act would be legal or illegal, it would be up to the people listed above, and rightfully so IMO.\n \n \nUnder the current situation, it is illegal for a man to have sex with a 5-year old.\n Under YOUR scenario, SOME cases of a man having sex with a 5-year old would be illegal. SOME cases would be legal.\n The line would be debated in a court of law based on concepts of \"was the child harmed\"...\n Concepts of \"did the child consent\"...\n \n My statement was entirely accurate and truthful.\n Your reply pointless.\n\n \n Yeah, whatever, under my scenario it wouldn't be legal or illegal. It would be up to the professionals and the parents. If you think it would be legal in some cases then you are saying that profesionals might say that sexual contact between one man and one child would not be harmful. Who are you to argue?\n \n \n1) I reiterate this because you didn't answer last time.\n I want the SPECIFIC CRIME you claim the pedophile would go to jail under with your scenario. There is no statute on the books of \"Chris harmed little Johnny\". There are multiple cases where \"harming\" a child is completely legal.\n \n 2) I also want the SPECIFIC CRIME you claim the parents would go to jail under with your scenario. There is no statute on the books of \"Little Johnny got harmed due to something the parents consented to\". There are multiple cases where this would be completely legal. Sports would be one perfect example.\n\n \n I honored your request above.\n \n \nOh. Well why didn't you say so then.\n Considering the \"professionals\" that are currently out there consistently and virtually universally acknowledge the harm, this moots the whole issue.\n The end effect of the law is virtually the same.\n < end sarcasm <\n\n \n Yep, sarcasm is fun, isn't it?\n \n \nWait a tick. You said that the child should have to visit \"at least two professionals\". Ergo, if these two SPECIFIC professionals claim that the child will not be harmed, the fun can commence. And I'm sure that the pedophile in mind will obviously be looking for a main-stream \"professional\" and not resort to picking a SPECIFIC professional who may be renowned for claiming that the child won't be \"harmed\"...\n \n Naw. That would NEVER happen...\n < Okay. REALLY ending sarcasm <\n\n \n What I meant is two professionals in the same field, if the girl has to visit a psychiatrist and pediatrician that would be four doctors. Why would the parents let the pedophile pick what professionals to go to?\n \n \n1) Such a \"list\" already exists. It's called the \"Age of Consent\" laws.\n It incorporates the fact that two professionals (heck, actually a whole phone book of professionals) acknowledge that the child will be harmed. It gives an \"age\" at which a child can safely participate.\n\n \n Yeah, apparently a child in one state is harmed by an act that a child in another state has no problem with. You can't generalise that much. If you are correct and all pedophilia is harmful, what is there to worry about?\n \n \n2) I love how you toss off ideals that you cling to BUT HAVE NEVER PROVIDED ANY PROOF for. \"eliminate the risk of physical and psychological harm\"...\n I'm still waiting for you to PROVE that...\n\n \n I've stated my opinion about this above. Two professionals in each field would have to agree and this would eliminate bias in favor of pedophilia. If they are \"renowned\" for allowing children to be hurt, they will lose their license.\n \n \nOh gee. You not responding to my arguments.\n There's a new twist...\n < end sarcasm <\n \n Just out of curiousity, do you realize that this \"approach\" of yours will allow my statements to go completely unchecked?\n\n \n Yep, I don't need to \"check\" your illogical arguments. I am not trying to prove anything to anyone. If you refuse to use logic and change the meanings of words then how can I argue? Your in your own little world there. I'm sure you will use that quote.:) At least I can see where you are coming from in the rest of your arguments.\n \n \nThis approach of yours is rather mundane.\n Food poisoning.\n Not all food poisons. But some does. Does that mean we don't call it \"food poisoning\", but rather strictly refer to it as \"bad spinach poisoning\"?\n No. We call it \"food poisoning\" because we acknowledge that SOME food poisons.\n\n \n OK, then lets continue with that logic. Some Heterosexuals rape, so rape victims are really heterosexuality victims. Murder victims are really bullet or knife victims. You just can't draw a logical parallel between food poisoning and rape, they are too different.\n \n \nDo we insist that the food that DOES poison not be referred to as \"food\"? Of course not. Because we're all intelligent enough to realize that SOME food poisons. \"Pedofile rapist\" is fine by me, as long as you also say \"herterosexual rapist\" just as often.\n \n Likewise, your complaints about heterosexual rape and homosexual rape and pedophilia rape are inane. SOME heterosexuals rape. SOME pedophiles rape.\n To refuse to call it \"heterosexual\" rape, or to refuse to acknowledge that it IS an example of \"pedophilia\" is inane.\n\n \n You are saying \"pedofilia victims\" not \"pedofile rape victims\". You also never say \"heterosexuality victims\" or \"heterosexual rape victims\".\n \n \nAnd to your question, if you can show me any news media which claims that a heterosexual rape isn't an example of \"heterosexuality\" (Again, an ATYPICAL example, but an example nonetheless), I welcome it.\n\n \n It is an EXAMPLE, just as pedophile rapes are Examples and not the norm.",

   "Yes, there is a chance that an offender would get away, but it's unlikely. I could have easily said that they would go to jail given the \"parental consent\" scenario, but I realise that the courts are not perfect. How do we remove all doubt? Do you think that every offender goes to jail now? Nope. So this whole argument that there is a chance that an offender could avoid jail is useless, it happens now.\n\n Are you familiar with how logical debate works?\n \n Typically, in discussing something like this, the proponent for change establishes a need for change. A SIGNIFICANCE for the need for change.\n You haven't done that. You have unilaterally refused to demonstrate the significance of what you want to do...\n You can't show me ANY cases of the REAL LIFE scenario where your proposed change would help something.\n \n In addition to significance, we have issues of ADVANTAGES and DISADVANTAGES. You show what the advantages of your plan are, and I show what the disadvantages are. Since you refuse to show any significance, the \"advantages\" are even more nebulous.\n On the flip side, we have a COMPARATIVE disadvantage on this issue.\n Right now, some pedophiles slip through the system because of failure to detect, and lack of evidence.\n Under your scenario, MORE pedophiles would slip through the system under the ADDITIONAL issue that the pedophiles would have more to argue for them. Before, all the state had to do was prove that a pedophile had sex with 8-year old Jimmy. They didn't need to prove \"harm\". They didn't need to broach the issue of whether or not the parents \"knew\" and \"consented\". These were non-issues, whereby you currently allow MORE ways for a pedophile to pretend that the rape never happened. That the coercion never happened.\n \n That would be a comparative DISADVANTAGE to your plan.\n Pointing to the fact that some pedophiles get away with molestation now doesn't negate the fact that your plan would allow MORE TO GET AWAY with molestation than before...\n \n \n \nWhat's your point? Do you not trust a jury of your peers? If not you should want to do away with the whole judicial system. Let me guess, you could decide but you don't trust others to do the same. What do you call that high horse of yours? You seem to think that the parents and jurors of this nation are a bunch of XXXXXX when compared to you, I guess I am to.\n\n Wow. I said SOOooo much of that without actually saying ANY of what you respond to...\n Ignoring your strawman jousting, I'll address your first question...\n \n In August of 1994, a jury awarded a multi-million dollar law-suit to a woman that had been burned by a hot cup of coffee.\n So to answer your question, I don't trust the potential for abuse of the system.\n \n But as far as \"trusting\", why don't we test BOTH of our \"trusts\".\n Let's put it up for a vote.\n \n You've laid out your arguments. So have I.\n How about we let the board \"vote\" on whether or not we should allow the legal scenario you describe...\n Or possibly, the nation...\n \n Would you be comfortable with that?\n \n \n \nOh noozzz, WHAT IF! I'm scared! A persuasive argument? That's scary!\n\n Dude. Seriously.\n Coming from a guy who has yet to show a SINGLE EXAMPLE for why the laws should be changed as you describe, I wouldn't joke.\n ALL your argument has been is a giant \"what if\"...\n \"What if\" our current understanding of pedophilia is wrong?\n \"What if\" the pedophiles didn't behave as our current research demonstrates?\n \"What if\" what we all knew to be true actually wasn't, because pedophiles were just poor trodden upon victims...\n \n \n \nYou mean that the pedophile MIGHT be able to convince a jury that the harm to a child was unforeseeable in his case? Most jurors would convict anyway, see \"Jury nullification\". If the defendant proves his case you would still want to convict them? This post is really showing your hate of the judicial system and Due process! Maybe you should be the judge, jury and executioner of the sick pedophiles who prove their cases! That would be perfect, wouldn't it? Are you a republican? You seem like someone from the \"Moral majority\".\n\n Again, you joust at strawman wind-mills. Trying to distort my position so you have a better founding to respond to is the sign of a weak position.\n \n And the sad part is that you can't even comprehend the depths of which you would open up the system to abuse.\n Rape cases currently put the victim on the stand, and expose rape victims to questions like \"What were you doing in a place like that dressed as you were?\" \"Did you like the sex?\" \"Why didn't you report the alleged rape until a week afterwards?\"\n Your scenario has opened the gateway for ALL of those questions to be introduced to little Johnny sitting on the stand.\n And what's worse? Little Johnny's parents could be told of this before-hand, and choose NOT TO PROSECUTE for fear of traumatizing little Johnny even more by a beligerent defense attorney.\n \n Again, COMPARATIVE disadvantages.\n \n \n \nI know, I want to \"allow\" doctors, psychologists and parents to decide what is best for their kids and jurrors to decide what is against the law. MAN, I'm a radical! That would be horrible!emoticon_xdonno \n\n Okay BigJ.\n Let's do it then.\n Let's allow ALL the doctors and psychologists to vote on the issue and decide. Should pre-pubescent kids be allowed to have sex with adults?\n \n I'm game.\n Are YOU game to \"allow\" them to make that decision?\n \n \n \nOK, I will decide what I think would be justified, that doesn't mean that it is the only way to go. I think that the child abuser should be charged with the same crime they are charged with now. The parents could be charged with being an \"accomplice to XXXX\", XXXX could be anything from \"child molestation\" to \"rape of a minor\", depending on the crime committed. The \"accomplice to XXXX\" charges should carry the same penalties as the crime it's self.\n\n Enough of the dodging the question. ANSWER the question by NAMING the crime they would be charged with under these scenarios.\n \n 1) Little Johnny is persuaded by Chris to have sex. The parents were not informed. Little Johnny was not hurt.\n What law did Chris break? What law would Chris be prosecuted with? NAME it.\n \n 2) Little Johnny decides to have sex with Chris, and asks Chris and his parents. They all say yes.\n Little Johnny is hurt during this sex.\n What law did they break? What law would Chris be prosecuted with? NAME the actual legal charge.\n \n Because if you can't do it, you're proving my point. By doing away with the CURRENT laws, you're setting up situations where there are NO LAWS to cover the situation, or the laws are easily circumventable.\n I know of NO law which exists for #1 under the changes you describe.\n #2 could be circumventable fairly easily. Apply any \"sports\" analogy where Little Johnny decides to engage in SportX, with the consent of his parents, and he is subsequently hurt.\n \n ANSWER the questions. NAME the applicable law.\n \n \n \nNope, I did not forget. Could you find the info? Nope. Neither can I, the fact that I can't has no bearing on the argument IMO. No one is going to report a case like that and it would be kept secret, so it's imposable to find. I'll look later though.\n\n Except, if everything is as benign as you say, and if you are accurate in your \"claim\" that most pedophilia is actually consentual, it SHOULD BE EASY to find.\n Like I explained. If a child has a consentual pedophile relationship at 9, and decided to argue in favor of pedophilia at age 28 by describing the situation, HE COULD. Statute of limitations should be over for the pedophile. He could even refuse to name the pedophile.\n The person who is now an adult is breaking no laws. He could be fighting for a cause that he supposedly believes in because he had a good experience when he was a kid. Because he believes there is nothing wrong with it.\n \n Yet we don't see this. And you want to pretend the absence of such a thing isn't significant, as you pretend that what it exemplifies is typical... emoticon_xdonno \n \n \n \nIf one party comes to the debate without statistics but with a logical argument to the contrary, does this disprove their logical argument? \n\n You haven't actually shown a logical argument.\n What \"argument\" do you think you are presenting that is \"logical\"?\n \n \n \nLet me ask you a hypothetical question. IF there were a lot of pedophiles who keep their attraction secret and never act on it, would it be easy to count how many there was? Nope, 'nuff said.\n\n Kinsey was counting homosexuals back when sodomy was illegal, and a gay man losing his job just for admitting he was gay was an obvious consequence without any legal recourse.\n Again, you try to obfuscate away your lack of ANY facts with lame excuses, ignoring others who have gotten past your feeble excuses before.\n Do you even know what research Kinsey did on pedophiles?\n \n \n \nYou are correct, I would revoke that law ...\n This does not mean the act would be legal or illegal, it would be up to the people listed above, and rightfully so IMO.\n\n Then how is that different from my assessment: \"it should be legal for a man to have sex with a 5-year old\"???\n \n It is currently ILLEGAL for a man to have sex with a 5-year old.\n You want it to be LEGAL for a man to have sex with a 5-year old.\n You want it to ILLEGAL for a man to HURT a 5-year old through sex, but the illegal part is the HURT.\n \n I described it right. Your demur is inane.\n \n \n \nYeah, whatever, under my scenario it wouldn't be legal or illegal. It would be up to the professionals and the parents.\n\n The professionals have spoken. Unilaterally.\n So why don't you listen to them???\n \n I find it interesting that on one hand, you complain that there isn't proper research, but on the other hand you want to trust a child to the analysis of just TWO professionals?\n When the vast majority have stated that it should be illegal, WHY do you ignore THEM but then state that you want to allow it for just 2???\n \n \n \nI honored your request above.\n\n ROFLMAO! No. You didn't. XXXX is not a crime.\n NAME the SPECIFIC crime.\n \n \n \nWhy would the parents let the pedophile pick what professionals to go to?\n\n Why not?\n After all, by your analysis, the pedophile's not a bad guy. He's just misunderstood and he's got the best interest of the kid at heart. He's thinking about what's best for the kid and not his johnson...\n Are you suddenly implying that the pedophile wouldn't pick the best professional?\n \n \n \nYep, I don't need to \"check\" your illogical arguments.\n\n You COMPLETELY FAIL to respond to my argument, but you generically label them as \"illogical\". With no explanation as to your categorization.\n \n \n \nI am not trying to prove anything to anyone. If you refuse to use logic and change the meanings of words then how can I argue? Your in your own little world there. I'm sure you will use that quote.:) At least I can see where you are coming from in the rest of your arguments.\n\n ROFLMAO! This debate started out interesting, but now it's just amusing...\n I am the one \"in my own little world\"?\n The experts UNILATERALLY acknowledge the harm to children via pedophilia. But you want to IGNORE that...\n It's currently illegal, and you want to change that, but you're \"not trying to prove anything to anyone\". Of course, that will leave the situation with the status quo, which I guess is an uncontested result. You want to change the system, but you aren't trying to prove that it should be changed...\n emoticon_xdonno \n \n Ooookkkayyyy... emoticon_xgood \n \n \n \nOK, then lets continue with that logic. Some Heterosexuals rape, so rape victims are really heterosexuality victims. Murder victims are really bullet or knife victims. You just can't draw a logical parallel between food poisoning and rape, they are too different.\n\n ROFLMAO!!!\n Victims of pedophilia are not the exception. They are the RULE.\n You can't show me ANY single case that meets your descriptions.\n \n If the same were true of heterosexuality, I would agree with a similar assessment. But since the VAST MAJORITY of people who engage in heterosexuality ARE NOT victims, you're flailing miserably.\n \"Murder victims\" a.k.a. \"bullet or knife victims\"? YES to all of the above. In fact, you'll find a variety of web-sites that talk about \"gun-shooting victims\", which is a better way to phrase it than awkwardly \"bullet victims\".\n Similarly, you would probably be arguing that \"gun-shot victims\" is inaccurate, because there is the possibility that somebody was HELPED by a gun-shot. Pehaps the bullet destroyed some cancerous area, and thus \"saved\" what I want to call a \"victim\"... \n \n And \"can't draw a logical parallel between food poisoning and rape\"...\n Spoken like somebody who can't logically explain why my analogy isn't workable, yet wants to refute it nonetheless....\n \n \n \nYou are saying \"pedofilia victims\" not \"pedofile rape victims\". You also never say \"heterosexuality victims\" or \"heterosexual rape victims\".\n\n If 99.9... out of a 100 women involved in heterosexuality were \"heterosexual rape victims\", I would refer to them as that...\n But feel free to keep ignoring that...\n \n \n \nIt is an EXAMPLE, just as pedophile rapes are Examples and not the norm.\n\n So you claim, but cannot prove.\n You can't even give ONE CASE where a child who was in a pedophiliac relationship was not \"victimized\" by it.\n \n And yet you make the above claim.\n It's like claiming that unicorns are the average horse, and not just an unseen \"example\"...",

Do you think it is imposable to debate without statistics? Honestly, I have been lazy and havn't even looked for any studies or cases, it just isn't a priority. The reason it hasn't been a priority is that it will not make a difference even if I do find them. On this subject, you can not change most peoples opinions.\n \n \nUnder your scenario, MORE pedophiles would slip through the system under the ADDITIONAL issue that the pedophiles would have more to argue for them.\n\n \n Pedofiles should not be arested unless they rape, then they are rapists. Do you want me to start responding to your post using your definition of pedofile or keep using the one in every dictionary? If pedofile is synonimous with child rapist then heterosexual is synonimous with rapist. The definition given in the dictionary does not equate a pedofile to a child rapist, you do. It doesn't even matter what percentage of pedofiles rape, if there are any that do not then \"pedophile\" does not equal \"child rapist\". Argue with the dictionary all you want, but that's the definition.\n \n \nBefore, all the state had to do was prove that a pedophile had sex with 8-year old Jimmy.

That the coercion never happened.\n\n \n They can pretend all they want, if they can not convince the jury they will still be punished. The bottom line is , if the prosicution proves their case, the rapist will go to jail. If the prosicution has a weak case then no one goes to jail. This is where the current situation and my scenario are exactly the same. If anything the jury would still convict a person who has sex with a child even if no harm is done. They do know, look at the cases with the fmail techers who have sex with their students.\n \n \nThat would be a comparative DISADVANTAGE to your plan.\n\n \n The fact that my \"plan\" would make the state prove their case is a disadvantage? Do you mean the fact that the state would have to prove harm would be a disadvantage? Both seem logical to me. Also most child molestation or child rape prosicuters already do this to play on the emotions of the jury.\n \n \nPointing to the fact that some pedophiles get away with molestation now doesn't negate the fact that your plan would allow MORE TO GET AWAY with molestation than before...\n\n \n How do you know that more would get through? The pedofile would have to meet all of the requirements of the law, if just like now, and prove his case in court. Again, harm = jail.\n \n \nWow. I said SOOooo much of that without actually saying ANY of what you respond to...\n Ignoring your strawman jousting, I'll address your first question...\n \n In August of 1994, a jury awarded a multi-million dollar law-suit to a woman that had been burned by a hot cup of coffee.\n So to answer your question, I don't trust the potential for abuse of the system. \n\n \n You say that you trust the system and then go on to show why they should not be trusted. You do refrase it, you state that you \"don't trust the potential for abuse of the system\". Nice try, the fact that you think that the system is easily abused proves that you don't trust the system. You do'nt trust the potential? Do you mean that abuse is probable?\n \n \nBut as far as \"trusting\", why don't we test BOTH of our \"trusts\".\n Let's put it up for a vote.\n \n You've laid out your arguments. So have I.\n How about we let the board \"vote\" on whether or not we should allow the legal scenario you describe...\n Or possibly, the nation...\n \n Would you be comfortable with that?\n\n \n Sure, why would I be uncomfortable? We should make a final argument before doing so. I know what the outcome would be, but who cares? The majority my rule but that doesn't make them right. Just look at our president.:) \n \n \nDude. Seriously.\n Coming from a guy who has yet to show a SINGLE EXAMPLE for why the laws should be changed as you describe, I wouldn't joke.\n\n \n I will do what I want, that includes joking. I don't get all stiff and stuck-up because I'm having a \"internet debate\".emoticon_xgood I have stated why I believe that the law should be changed. Yous have admitted that not all adult-minor sex is harmful and deserves to be outlawed, I agree. The difference is you want to pick some arbitrary age at which it becomes \"safe\" and I want it to be on a case by case basis. That is the ONLY difference.\n \n \nALL your argument has been is a giant \"what if\"...\n \"What if\" our current understanding of pedophilia is wrong?\n\n \n Most peoples understanding of pedofilia is wrong. They think, as you do, that all pedofiles rape and use the two terms interchangably. Prove to me that this is the case and I will be fine with your use of the word.\n \n \n\"What if\" the pedophiles didn't behave as our current research demonstrates?\n\n \n You already know my thoughts on this \"research\". Why can't you make a logical argument without it?\n \n \n\"What if\" what we all knew to be true actually wasn't, because pedophiles were just poor trodden upon victims...\n\n \n I'm not saying that all pedofiles are inoccent.\n \n \nAgain, you joust at strawman wind-mills. Trying to distort my position so you have a better founding to respond to is the sign of a weak position.\n\n \n LOL! That statement is hilarious. I post a logical conclusion and you portay it as \"distorting your position\". This is spin at it's worst. If I am twisting your words then you should clarify your view of the judicial system. How does \"I don't trust the potential for abuse of the system\" Differ from \"I don't trust the system\"? Be carefull, your proving my point. The differince is that in the first quote you stat why you don't trust the system, in the second (altough not from you) is just stating the obvious. How do you not trust a potential? That doesn't even make sense. Let me get to the point, what is the potintial for abuse of the system? Your answer = too high. In a sense you are throwing all of the rape cases out the window. Unles you think that the courts are only \"abused\" in the defendants favor. If that is your contention, I can easily prove you wrong.\n \n \nAnd the sad part is that you can't even comprehend the depths of which you would open up the system to abuse.\n Rape cases currently put the victim on the stand, and expose rape victims to questions like \"What were you doing in a place like that dressed as you were?\" \"Did you like the sex?\" \"Why didn't you report the alleged rape until a week afterwards?\"\n\n \n How would \"I\" be opening the system to abuse? The only extra part that the state would have to prove is harm. How is this bad again? It wouldn't matter how the minor was dressed or if they enjoyed it at the time or how long it takes them to report. Harm or no harm, that is the question. Should that not be the question? Isn't that what the law is there to prevent? Answer that for me.\n \n \nYour scenario has opened the gateway for ALL of those questions to be introduced to little Johnny sitting on the stand.\n\n \n YOU already said that they are already asked, next point.\n \n \nAnd what's worse? Little Johnny's parents could be told of this before-hand, and choose NOT TO PROSECUTE for fear of traumatizing little Johnny even more by a beligerent defense attorney.\n\n \n This also happens now. Any time you ask a chind who has been the victime of this kind of crime it will hurt them, at least teporarily. Also, you basically admited that the same questions would be asked.\n \n \nAgain, COMPARATIVE disadvantages.\n\n \n Nope, no disadvantage. All of the points you have listed so far are common to the current sytem or they are not disadvantages. I would even say that at least on of them is an ADVANTAGE.\n \n \n \nOkay BigJ.\n Let's do it then.\n Let's allow ALL the doctors and psychologists to vote on the issue and decide. Should pre-pubescent kids be allowed to have sex with adults?\n\n \n How would this differ from the current system? If they all got together and voted on every case seperatly I would have no problem with it. The problem is that they choose an arbitrary age that sexual acts become \"safe\", regardless of ANYTHING. Age is the only consideration, not maturity, frame of mind, motivaton, benifits, physical atributes, etc. NOTHING else matters. Is this really the best way to deal with this issue? If not, then what is? Anwere that.\n \n \nI'm game.\n Are YOU game to \"allow\" them to make that decision?\n\n \n Nope, not a blanket decision that takes nothing but age into consideration. You know that they have alredy done this anyway.\n \n \nEnough of the dodging the question. ANSWER the question by NAMING the crime they would be charged with under these scenarios. \n\n \n Eather you are an idiot or you are trying to make an issue out of a non-issue. YOU KNOW what I meant and I'm sure everone else does to. The child abuser would be charged with the EXACT SAME CRIME as he would be under the current system. The parrents would be charged as an eccesory to that crime and it would carry the same punishments. I will reply to the question again though.\n \n \n1) Little Johnny is persuaded by Chris to have sex. The parents were not informed. Little Johnny was not hurt.\n What law did Chris break? What law would Chris be prosecuted with? NAME it. \n\n \n The SAME thing he would be charged with now. I don't know all of the legal terms. You tell me, what would he be charged with now? Statutory rape?\n \n \n2) Little Johnny decides to have sex with Chris, and asks Chris and his parents. They all say yes.\n Little Johnny is hurt during this sex.\n What law did they break? What law would Chris be prosecuted with? NAME the actual legal charge.\n\n \n You are forgetting the requirments. If all of the profesionals agreed then they are responsable. If the did not then the same it is the same crime as above.\n \n \nBecause if you can't do it, you're proving my point. By doing away with the CURRENT laws, you're setting up situations where there are NO LAWS to cover the situation, or the laws are easily circumventable.\n\n \n How is this? The current charges would still apply, the only change is what is needed to convict and the addition of \"accesory\" to the name of those laws in the case of parents who allow it.\n \n \nI know of NO law which exists for #1 under the changes you describe.\n\n \n I guess it would be impossable to create new ones, right?emoticon_xdonno However, any time child is harmed the ofender would be charge with the same charge the current system uses. The only \"new\" charges would be the \"accesory\" charges.\n \n \n#2 could be circumventable fairly easily. Apply any \"sports\" analogy where Little Johnny decides to engage in SportX, with the consent of his parents, and he is subsequently hurt.\n\n \n The law would differentite between the two. The defendant would still be charged. If the defendant uses that as a deffence in court it's up to the jury, and rightfuly so.\n \n \nANSWER the questions. NAME the applicable law.\n\n \n I don't know the legalname for a charge of child rape or molestation. It really doesn't matter what the technical term is. The bottom lin is they would be the same charges.\n \n \nExcept, if everything is as benign as you say, and if you are accurate in your \"claim\" that most pedophilia is actually consentual, it SHOULD BE EASY to find.\n\n \n You don't seem like a dumb guy, but you're starting to make a case to the contrary. Do you rally think that those people would make their relationship public? They would be arrested instantly. These relationships are rare to begin with, if they even exist. I've never said that they do, if I have then find the quote. The chances of a parent that would allow it and a pedophile wanting it meating up and trusting each other are nearly zero. Do you agree?\n \n \nLike I explained. If a child has a consentual pedophile relationship at 9, and decided to argue in favor of pedophilia at age 28 by describing the situation, HE COULD. Statute of limitations should be over for the pedophile. He could even refuse to name the pedophile.\n The person who is now an adult is breaking no laws. He could be fighting for a cause that he supposedly believes in because he had a good experience when he was a kid. Because he believes there is nothing wrong with it.\n\n \n What makes you think that he would care or not fear being ridiculed or loosing his life? Do you think that all minors hate their sexual experiances with adukts? What about the guy who had a baby with his teacher/ He still wanted to see her and I belive he did after she got out. Why didn't he become a spokesman?\n \n \nYet we don't see this. And you want to pretend the absence of such a thing isn't significant, as you pretend that what it exemplifies is typical... emoticon_xdonno \n\n \n I never said that the typical sexual contact between a child and an adult was mutual. Most sexual relationships between a child and adult is child abuse. What I have said is that I belive there are many pedofiles that never touch a child. Here is something you might find interesting. Most child rapists arn't pedofiles.\n \n \nUse of the term pedophile to describe all child sexual offenders is seen as problematic by some people,[12][13][14] especially when viewed from a medical standpoint, as the majority of sex crimes against children are perpetrated by situational offenders rather than people sexually preferring prepubertal children.[15][16][17] Nevertheless, some researchers, such as Howard E. Barbaree,[18] have endorsed the use of actions as a sole criterion for the diagnosis of pedophilia as a means of taxonomic simplification, rebuking the American Psychiatric Association's standards as \"unsatisfactory\".\n\n \n That's from http://www.cooldictionary.com/words/pedofilia.xlwikipedia\n \n \nYou haven't actually shown a logical argument.\n What \"argument\" do you think you are presenting that is \"logical\"?\n\n \n Every single one of them. Why would I post them otherwise?\n \n If harm = jail then that is the ideal situation.\n A case by case process is the best kind of prosses.\n The current sytem is illogical.\n The current system is contradictory.\n Most child abusers are not pedofiles.\n Not all pedofiles are child abusers.\n It's hard to gather info that supports pedofilia.\n People are biasd on this subject.\n Some child-adult sexual realaionships are good.\n Most of the pedofilia case that are reported are those involving a child rapist.\n Good cases are portraid as bad.\n Even if concetual pedofile relationships are seen as rape.\n I could go on.....\n \n Make a brief logical arument against each one.\n \n \nKinsey was counting homosexuals back when sodomy was illegal, and a gay man losing his job just for admitting he was gay was an obvious consequence without any legal recourse.\n\n \n You sure do like to compare homosexuality to pedofilia alot. I'll ask you this question again, since you decided not to answer it the last time I asked it. What was the punishment for sodomy when it was illegal? Was it federal prison and having to be on a list and tell your neibors that you are an offender for many years? If not then you can't equate the two. Do you think that homosexuals (sodomists) were as secritive when sodomy was illegal as pedofiles are today? Do you think they were ever as hated as pedofiles?\n \n \nAgain, you try to obfuscate away your lack of ANY facts with lame excuses, ignoring others who have gotten past your feeble excuses before.\n Do you even know what research Kinsey did on pedophiles?\n\n \n No, but I bet I know what side the studies took. I don't care if you think I am posting lame excuses. IMO they are logical arguments. You list some \"facts\" from biasd studies but you can't make a logical argument without them, that's a sign of a weak case. Why don't you try that with your next post?\n \n \nThen how is that different from my assessment: \"it should be legal for a man to have sex with a 5-year old\"???\n\n \n Because I don't know if it should be legal so that is not how I feel and that's why I have never said that. It should be legal for a man to have sex with a five year old if several experts have agrread that it would cause no harm and each case is studies seperatly.\n \n \nIt is currently ILLEGAL for a man to have sex with a 5-year old.\n You want it to be LEGAL for a man to have sex with a 5-year old.\n You want it to ILLEGAL for a man to HURT a 5-year old through sex, but the illegal part is the HURT.\n\n \n Should things that hurt no one be illegal? Also note that I said it should be illegal if it hurts the child emotionaly or physicaly or does not meet the requirments.\n \n \nI described it right. Your demur is inane.\n\n \n Nope.\n \n \nThe professionals have spoken. Unilaterally.\n So why don't you listen to them???\n\n \n Because they have not studied every case and they are biased IMO. Why shouldn't it be decided on a case by case basis? Give me a logical arument against that.\n \n \nI find it interesting that on one hand, you complain that there isn't proper research, but on the other hand you want to trust a child to the analysis of just TWO professionals?\n\n \n I find it interesting that you are willing to use only biased studies as profe and cannot make a logical argument againt my senarion without them. I trust two profesionals of two profession, that's four (since you seem to have a problem counting) because I belive that they will err on the side of coution. All four would have to agree.\n \n \nWhen the vast majority have stated that it should be illegal, WHY do you ignore THEM but then state that you want to allow it for just 2???\n\n \n Again, it's 4. Because I belive it should be decided on a case by case basis. Why shouldn't it be?\n \n \nROFLMAO! No. You didn't. XXXX is not a crime.\n NAME the SPECIFIC crime.\n\n \n Man, that case is getting stronger and stronger.emoticon_xdonno They will be charged with THE SAME CRIME, and that charge will also apply to the parents(minor name change).\n \n \nWhy not?\n After all, by your analysis, the pedophile's not a bad guy.\n He's just misunderstood and he's got the best interest of the kid at heart. He's thinking about what's best for the kid and not his johnson...\n Are you suddenly implying that the pedophile wouldn't pick the best professional?\n\n \n He may be bad, I never said that there were no bad pedofiles. My mouth is getting full, quit putting words in there. The parents wouldn't allow it because they are risking jail time. If the do, then they will get what's coming to them.\n \n \nYou COMPLETELY FAIL to respond to my argument, but you generically label them as \"illogical\". With no explanation as to your categorization.\n\n \n That was referencing your \"pedofilia victim\" problem. If you know how to read you can tell my the context it was used in. I have responded to that argument. Can you read? Do you want me to quote all of the time I responded to that argument? You must think dictionaries are illogical because they disagree with you on the definition of \"pedofilia\".\n \n \nROFLMAO! This debate started out interesting, but now it's just amusing...\n\n \n Yep, you're right.\n \n \nI am the one \"in my own little world\"?\n\n \n When talking about \"pedophile victims\" you are. Again, context pwns joo.\n \n \nThe experts UNILATERALLY acknowledge the harm to children via pedophilia. But you want to IGNORE that...\n\n \n Change that to child rape...\n \n \nIt's currently illegal, and you want to change that, but you're \"not trying to prove anything to anyone\".\n\n \n I want it to be decided on a case by case basis by profesionals. Why not? The statments I make are mearly the conclusion I come to, my scenario will never happen anyway.\n \n \n Of course, that will leave the situation with the status quo, which I guess is an uncontested result. You want to change the system, but you aren't trying to prove that it should be changed...\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n I have listed why I think it needs to change but I realise that people are very rigid on this issue. It would be nearly imposable to change anyones mind and I am by no means the guy to do it. \n \n \n \n \nROFLMAO!!!\n Victims of pedophilia are not the exception. They are the RULE.\n You can't show me ANY single case that meets your descriptions.\n\n \n Prove that most pedophiles rape. Do it. How did you like my quote that mentioned that most child rapists aren't pedofiles? I looked for it fo 2 min, maybe I will find more later.\n \n \nIf the same were true of heterosexuality, I would agree with a similar assessment. But since the VAST MAJORITY of people who engage in heterosexuality ARE NOT victims, you're flailing miserably.\n\n \n You are failing miserably to prove that most pedofiles rape. Nice false victory.\n \n \n\"Murder victims\" a.k.a. \"bullet or knife victims\"? YES to all of the above. In fact, you'll find a variety of web-sites that talk about \"gun-shooting victims\", which is a better way to phrase it than awkwardly \"bullet victims\".\n\n \n See, what I'm getting at is that it is not the gun that causes the crime. It's the evil person. I'll make it simpler for you. Does the desire to have money cause bank robberies?\n \n \nSimilarly, you would probably be arguing that \"gun-shot victims\" is inaccurate, because there is the possibility that somebody was HELPED by a gun-shot.\n\n \n Wow! Where did that stupid analogy com from? I would never claim that a bullet wound helps people. Are you equating the benifits of a sexual relationship to a bullet wound? WOW!emoticon_confused \n \n \nPehaps the bullet destroyed some cancerous area, and thus \"saved\" what I want to call a \"victim\"... \n\n \n :xbanghead \n \n \nAnd \"can't draw a logical parallel between food poisoning and rape\"...\n Spoken like somebody who can't logically explain why my analogy isn't workable, yet wants to refute it nonetheless....\n\n \n The fact that you think the two are simular speaks volumes.emoticon_xgood Here we go:\n \n One is a VIOLENT act.\n One is MEANT to hurt someone.\n One is COMMITED by an evil person.\n One is a crime.\n One Happens by accedent.\n One does not scar someone emotionaly.\n \n Can you tell wich one I am speaking about in each statment? Yep. Next point.\n \n \n If 99.9... out of a 100 women involved in heterosexuality were \"heterosexual rape victims\", I would refer to them as that...\n But feel free to keep ignoring that...\n\n \n Look at the quoted article above.\n \n \nSo you claim, but cannot prove.\n You can't even give ONE CASE where a child who was in a pedophiliac relationship was not \"victimized\" by it.\n \n And yet you make the above claim.\n It's like claiming that unicorns are the average horse, and not just an unseen \"example\"...\n\n \n -Every pedofilia case is seen as rape.\n -Every pedofilia case that the child concents to is considerd to involve coersion.\n -Any \"good\" case of pedofilia must be, and is, hidden.\n \n You make the claim that rape is the norm among pedofiles, yet you provide no proof. Show me how many do not rape, unless you believe that the ALL do.\n \n Sorry for the bad spelling, I was in a hurry.",

The second they reach the age at which they are considered adults they become criminals. I had to end a relationship because of this. These laws apply even if the relationship is concentual, but I'm not saying that children can or can't consent.\n \n I should really clarify and simplify what foundit and I have been debating about. I posted about a system that I though would be preferable to the current one. I stated that that there is no age at which everyone magically becomes an adult. Therefor, the ability to consent should be decided on a case by case basis instead of a blanket judgment. We would not require this, but it should be an option for minors with the parents consent. If a minor wants to be free to consent they would have to see several professionals (two from each profession that is relevant) and if the professionals all agree and and the parents consent then I don't see a problem with it.

If the parents allow this to happen the will face the same charges as the partner, the only difference will be the name of the charge (add \"accessory to\" to the beginning). The professionals would lose their licenses and go to jail if they are proven not to be acting in the minors best interest. If any harm is done to the minor someone would be held accountable. That could be the partner only(if he acted alone), the partner and the parents ( if they allowed the offender to do something that the professionals prohibited) or the professionals (if they didn't act in the minors best interest).

That's pretty insignificant. It doesn't affect a relationship between minors, I don't think. Does it stop an older minor (like a 18 year old) from having sex with a younger minor (like a15 year old)? if so, many minors would face charges. All I have talked about in this last paragraph is if these acts are legally allowed, but what about morals?

I assure you there are many on this forum who would have taken a very irrational line given the subject. But anyway, that's irrelevant.\n \n \nbe honest I'm getting tired of going over the same arguments. It's nice to have another point of view.\nWell, I'll do my best. But not having really read through the previous I can't guarantee you won't have to make the same points to me too...\n \n \n \nHere in the states the age of consent varies by state to state and in some states the age of the partner is taken into consideration. Honestly, in all states the age of he partner is taken into consideration. If they are also minors then they are not prosecuted. The second they reach the age at which they are considered adults they become criminals. I had to end a relationship because of this. These laws apply even if the relationship is concentual, but I'm not saying that children can or can't consent.\nI assume however that whilst they are not prosecuted, it's still technically illegal though. The same is true over here, whilst it is illegal for two underage kids to have sex, it's pretty much unheard of for an legal action to be taken. That is, of course, unless the age of consent is straddled.\n \n \n \nI should really clarify and simplify what foundit and I have been debating about. I posted about a system that I though would be preferable to the current one.

The bottom line is that in this system harm would equal consequence. If no harm is proven then no one will go to jail.\nI see. Well I don't object to the logic behind your argument. I agree of course that there is no magical age. Instead the age of consent we have is one of convenience and security. We accept that below a certain age the vast majority of the population are incapable of making informed decisions about various things. Voting, crime, drinking and sex all being examples of such. And despite the obvious fact that some will of course be mature enough to cope with them, I still feel that in the interests of protecting the majority those few will have to wait a few years. As I've said in all practicality they are still able to have sex with others of a similar age without a real threat of legal reaction. And finally, to be honest I do doubt the maturity/ rationality of any child who does willingly want to enter into a sexual relationship with someone significantly their elder anyway. And the adult's too, for that matter. Prejudiced? Maybe...\n \n I also think that it runs the risk of making paedophilia seem more acceptable. I can see it as quite likely that a paedophile may well stop himself from acting on impulses because of the current illegality of the act. However if the act were made technically legal, I'd see it as much easier to justify force/ coercion on a child to oneself and therefore act on such impulses.\n \n \nI can tell that you skimmed through by that statement.:)\nYeah, sorry! I thought it better to see if you would re-state your position than me piece it together by wading through looong posts...\n \n \nI have more requirements than that. The first way that this is prevented is by requiring several doctors to agree. \nI see. Ok, I'm still wary. There are countless occasions of Social Services (who I'd say are probably more qualified to make such a decision than an MD) getting investigations very very wrong. Either ignoring systematic abuse that is pointed out to them, or creating severe trauma to families by over-reacting on flimsy evidence and splitting them up for years or even decades. I don't blame SS, it is an incredibly difficult job. But that is why I am very reluctant to open up another avenue where they could potentially get it wrong and destroy people's lives for what I see as negligible overall benefit.\n \n Out of interest, would you allow incest as part of the proposals? ie would it be acceptable for a parent to apply for a relationship with their own child, or would it have to be someone not related?\n \n \n \nThe second is the threat of jail time, this is the only deterrent that the current system has.\nThat and the stigma imposed by media hysteria of course. Not that for a moment I advocate such a thing as positive.\n \n \n \nWell, I did not mean \"case\" in the criminal since.\nFair enough. I work for the British equivalent of the DA's office. I spose I tend to read everything in a legal related context. Sorry!\n \n \n \nI was merely stating that it is impossible to have ANY sexual relationship with a minor, as an adult, without it being seen as rape. In other words, since a minor can't consent all relationships are rape to the system.\nWell of course that's because legally it is, consent or not! But I do understand what you are saying. I'm not entirely sure this is true, I'm reminded of a case about a year ago in the papers where a teacher had a relationship with a consenting child. The case was very much presented as a breach of the teaching code, but acknowledged the consent of the child. That said, I agree with you, any sexual activity with children is generally portrayed as rape. But I do think that's because in the vast majority of cases it is, or coercion at least...\n \n \n \nI'm glad that you used the word \"assumed\". That is what I am saying, it's a blanket assumption and not all minors are the same. I am not saying that all minors can consent, I don't think they all can, I am saying that it should be decided on a case by case basis and be decided by professionals and parents.\nYes, I realize. And whilst I agree with the logic behind the statement, I don't believe the benefits of such a move would outweigh the risks.\n \n \n \nAny pedophilia that doesn't harm anyone. You may or may not believe that this is possible but that is what I meant. I should have said \"harmless\" instead. \nFair enough, I wouldn't use the term 'good' myself, but yes I am happy with the use of the term 'harmless'.\n \n \n \nWell, that would really make very little difference. The only time that would change anything in America is if a person less than two years over the age of consent is having a relationship with a minor in the last two years of that they are considered a minor. That's pretty insignificant. \nThough it was exactly the problem you highlighted when saying \"The second they reach the age at which they are considered adults they become criminals. I had to end a relationship because of this. These laws apply even if the relationship is concentual\". Such a system would eliminate this, and in a way that I think would open no room for potential abuse.\n \n \nIf all other things are equal, what is the difference between having sex with a 15 year old and a 20 year old? I don't get this part.\nBecause, generally all other things aren't equal! We make an assumption as a society that people under a certain age are not emotionally capable of dealing with the consequences of a sexual relationship. We also make an assumption that anyone who would want to do such a thing is not the most savoury of characters. And I believe that while of course unfair to a tiny minority (and only on a temporary basis at that), these assumptions are justified in order to protect children.\n \n Another point of clarification: do you propose that all people are screened to check for emotional suitability, or just 'minors' as you call them? If the latter, then you are still acknowledging the convenience of an implied 'age at which everyone magically becomes an adult', albeit more flexibly than the current system. If the former, well I just don't see it as practical screening everyone before they have sex...\n \n \nBTW: You should at least go back and read the last four posts.\nOops, just read this after responding to all your points. I've only just got back from work and it's gone midnight, so I'll have to pass tonight. I will though tomorrow...",

   "What point have you made that you think I should reply to?\n \n These posts get very long, and quite frankly at times I have hit \"reply\" with as far into the post as I could wade.\n\n \n \n I don't feel like going back to find them. I understand, the posts have really been too long. How about the post before my last (the one with the link)?\n \n \nAnd on another note, there are a LOT of points which you quite frankly do not \"retern the favor\" on. At least not to any reasonable level of satisfaction.\n\n \n You mean because I don't agree or use statistics? I could say the same but we arn't here to satisfy each other.\n \n \nI've always thought Foundit to be quite fair and rational in debates. I assure you there are many on this forum who would have taken a very irrational line given the subject. But anyway, that's irrelevant.\n\n \n Yeah, I'm sure he's a good guy. I just think he's getting emotional over this topic, and rightfully so. I still don't think he took the most rational line, if so he would agree.emoticon_xgood \n \n \nWell, I'll do my best. But not having really read through the previous I can't guarantee you won't have to make the same points to me too...\n\n \n Even if so, you may put them in a way that will change my mind.\n \n \n I assume however that whilst they are not prosecuted, it's still technically illegal though. The same is true over here, whilst it is illegal for two underage kids to have sex, it's pretty much unheard of for an legal action to be taken. That is, of course, unless the age of consent is straddled.\n\n \n No, it isn't illegal at all. There is no charge that covers that scenario here and I think that's a good thing.\n \n \nI see. Well I don't object to the logic behind your argument. I agree of course that there is no magical age. Instead the age of consent we have is one of convenience and security. We accept that below a certain age the vast majority of the population are incapable of making informed decisions about various things. Voting, crime, drinking and sex all being examples of such. And despite the obvious fact that some will of course be mature enough to cope with them, I still feel that in the interests of protecting the majority those few will have to wait a few years.\n\n \n That's understandable, but I don't think that the scenario we I brought up would hurt anyone. The normal age of consent laws could stay in place and this would merely be an option for those who want to be able to consent before they are allowed to by the current system, as long as they meet all of the requirements.\n \n \n As I've said in all practicality they are still able to have sex with others of a similar age without a real threat of legal reaction. And finally, to be honest I do doubt the maturity/ rationality of any child who does willingly want to enter into a sexual relationship with someone significantly their elder anyway. And the adult's too, for that matter. Prejudiced? Maybe...\n\n \n Yeah, I guess to me, a physical act is a physical act. If a child wants to have sex with an older guy (very doubtful), and meets all of the requirements, then I don't think anyone will be harmed. Why do you doubt the rationality of the child or the adult? Because they are choosing someone so different than themselves? This would not just apply to prepubesent children but also teens who are barely under the legal age. I honestly think that there would be nearly no cases of doctor approved pedophilia anyway.\n \n \nI also think that it runs the risk of making paedophilia seem more acceptable.\n \n \n Although I do think that it's a little strange, I don't hate pedophiles. I don't think society should either. Honestly, as long as no one is hurt, I don't care who (or what emoticon_xdonno) anyone is attracted to. Did you mean child abuse?\n \n \nI can see it as quite likely that a paedophile may well stop himself from acting on impulses because of the current illegality of the act. However if the act were made technically legal, I'd see it as much easier to justify force/ coercion on a child to oneself and therefore act on such impulses.\n\n \n How would one justify force/coercion to you? Could you see through the lies? The bottom line is that if a child is hurt, physically or mentally, the offender would go to jail. Intent wouldn't matter, like it does in murder cases. If the child was hurt, you are guilty. Do you think that \"the state\" is so incompetent that they can't convict a guilty man? If so, your disagreement should be with the people that run the system and not the people who would change laws to what they see as an improvement. If laws aren't enforceable, are there any laws?\n \n \nYeah, sorry! I thought it better to see if you would re-state your position than me piece it together by wading through looong posts... \n\n \n Yeah, no problem, that's why I did.\n \n \nI see. Ok, I'm still wary. There are countless occasions of Social Services (who I'd say are probably more qualified to make such a decision than an MD) getting investigations very very wrong. Either ignoring systematic abuse that is pointed out to them, or creating severe trauma to families by over-reacting on flimsy evidence and splitting them up for years or even decades. I don't blame SS, it is an incredibly difficult job. But that is why I am very reluctant to open up another avenue where they could potentially get it wrong and destroy people's lives for what I see as negligible overall benefit.\n\n \n Well I didn't say that we should use SS, but it doesn't matter. No matter who you use some will make a mistake. Do you think four professionals and two parents would all make a big mistake at once? Do you think that doctors who know that their practice and are already biased is on the line will be eager to overlook the facts to grant permission? Do you think that parents will be careless with their kids if they know that they could go to prison? Both of these things would have to happen at the same time for a child to be hurt.\n \n \nOut of interest, would you allow incest as part of the proposals? ie would it be acceptable for a parent to apply for a relationship with their own child, or would it have to be someone not related?\n\n \n No, it is a conflict of interests. The parents are the first line of defence in this scenario and if one of them wants to be the partner that will do away with one of the levels of protection.\n \n \nThat and the stigma imposed by media hysteria of course. Not that for a moment I advocate such a thing as positive.\n\n \n That's refreshing. I HATE child rapists and molesters as much as the next guy but I don't have an insatiable rage to kill all pedophiles(or even the offenders), just as I don't want to kill all homo/heterosexuals for the rape that a few commit.\n \n \nFair enough. I work for the British equivalent of the DA's office. I spose I tend to read everything in a legal related context. Sorry!\n\n \n Cool, thanks for your service, even though I don't live in your country.emoticon_xgood Is there a great difference in the procedures in the states and Britain?\n \n \nWell of course that's because legally it is, consent or not! But I do understand what you are saying. I'm not entirely sure this is true, I'm reminded of a case about a year ago in the papers where a teacher had a relationship with a consenting child. The case was very much presented as a breach of the teaching code, but acknowledged the consent of the child. That said, I agree with you, any sexual activity with children is generally portrayed as rape. But I do think that's because in the vast majority of cases it is, or coercion at least...\n\n \n I agree, the vast majority of sexual contact between adults and minors involves coercion or rape. This does not mean that all pedophiles rape (as foundit believes), or even that a majority of them do. In the post before my last post I quoted an article that stated that the majority of child abuse cases do not involve pedophiles. Most are committed by opportunistic rapists (who prefer adults) or sadist. It also states that pedophilia MAY be a sexual orientation AND CAN ALSO be a disorder. I do believe it is a sexual orientation, look up the definition. I don't think that pedophilia, itself is a disorder, but I'm obviously less qualified to make such a statement.\n \n Do you HONESTLY see the it differently when a male student is \"raped\" by a female teacher? Tell the truth! I think it's a double standard and it's funny that some of the same people who want to kill all pedophiles(this term is also used to describe hebephiles and child rapists) would want to give the student a \"high-five\". Do you notice that when they report on this case they don't use the \"P-word\"?\n \n \nYes, I realize. And whilst I agree with the logic behind the statement, I don't believe the benefits of such a move would outweigh the risks.\n\n \n The risk that if a person proves their innocence to a jury of their peers, they will be acquitted?\n \n \nFair enough, I wouldn't use the term 'good' myself, but yes I am happy with the use of the term 'harmless'.\n\n \n Yes, it was a bad choice of words. Many things aren't \"good\" or \"harmless\" but are \"acceptable\". Figure that one out.:) \n \n \nThough it was exactly the problem you highlighted when saying \"The second they reach the age at which they are considered adults they become criminals. I had to end a relationship because of this. These laws apply even if the relationship is concentual\". Such a system would eliminate this, and in a way that I think would open no room for potential abuse.\n\n \n Well, my relationship would have still been illegal, she was 14 or 15 when I turned 18. I guarantee you that no harm was caused (except by the forced split) and it was a genuine relationship with no coercion. I guess this is what gives me a different view than most. Would the system you speak of make sex between a 17 YO and a 14 YO illegal?\n \n \nBecause, generally all other things aren't equal! We make an assumption as a society that people under a certain age are not emotionally capable of dealing with the consequences of a sexual relationship. We also make an assumption that anyone who would want to do such a thing is not the most savoury of characters. And I believe that while of course unfair to a tiny minority (and only on a temporary basis at that), these assumptions are justified in order to protect children.\n\n \n You did not answer the question. I did not ask if all things are generally equal. I'm leading to another question with this one. What do you mean by \"only on a temporary basis at that\"? Generalizations are OK if only a minority is wrongly affected? How do you feel about racial profiling? Should we immediately convict all people who are arrested? The majority are guilty!\n \n \nAnother point of clarification: do you propose that all people are screened to check for emotional suitability, or just 'minors' as you call them? If the latter, then you are still acknowledging the convenience of an implied 'age at which everyone magically becomes an adult', albeit more flexibly than the current system. If the former, well I just don't see it as practical screening everyone before they have sex...\n\n \n Just minors who request to be allowed to consent and who's parents agree. the others would have to wait until the turn whatever age the state requires. I don't see any convenience in the current system. Laws are there to preserve rights and prevent harm. If they are doing neither in even one case, then there is room for improvement. Does the ease of enforcement and prosecution take precedent over justification? Should we not care about a minority that is being mistreated or wrongly convicted even if no harm is done?\n \n \nOops, just read this after responding to all your points. I've only just got back from work and it's gone midnight, so I'll have to pass tonight. I will though tomorrow...\n\n \n Well, you obviously don't have to, I'm nacho boss.:) that's still a lot of reading. After looking at this post, maybe it's my fault.emoticon_confused",
