   "barackobama2008.com takes you to Ron Paul -- gee, how clever. \n \n \" I am strongly pro life. Life begins at conception ... but, I do not believe this should be a federal matter. All issues of life and violence and crime and murder are dealt with at the local level. \" \n \n Local level? I guess that's why he's sponsored the FEDERAL \"The Sanctity of Life Act\", which states: (1) human life shall be deemed to exist from conception, without regard to race, sex, age, health, defect, or condition of dependency; and (2) the term \"person\" shall include all such human life.\n \n \"Condition of dependency\" presumably refers to the fact that one \"person\" is growing within the body of another person -- but that won't matter, as they will have equal rights. Imagine if this was made law! Child support retroactive to the moment of conception? Oh, that will be popular with the deadbeat dads. And how will the State determine when this \"person\" comes into being and enforce the protection of the law? Periodic pregnancy tests for women in the child bearing years? \n \n These human life amendments and acts have been cropping up in the 3+ decades since Roe v Wade and have never passed because experienced lawmakers know the repercussions are unmanageable. They're just for show, to demonstrate the \"pro-life\" bona fides of their sponsors.",
