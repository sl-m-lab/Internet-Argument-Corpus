   "Another nauseating display of subservience\n \n Boca Raton,Florida -- Vice President Dick Cheney breezed into south Palm Beach County on Friday and gave a speech to nearly 500 Jews, reiterating the Bush administration's support for Israel.\n \n Cheney pledged to remain a strong ally to Israel and focused on the administration's determination to win the war against terror. One of the biggest ovations came when he talked of Bush's \"unwavering support for Israel as a vibrant Jewish state.\"\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=2878\n \n \n Zionists Kill Children Again\n \n US-taxpayer-financed Israeli forces fired machine guns, artillery shells and a missile into a peaceful Palestinian children's march in the Rafah concentration camp area on May 19, 2004, slaughtering at least ten and wounding around fifty people. The demonstration was in opposition to recent Zionist demolitions of Palestinian homes in Gaza, which is a state terrorist action in violation of international law, and came a day after Israel killed twenty-four Palestinians and wounded scores in the same area.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=2928\n \n \n Israelis Demolish Palestinian Zoo, Killing Animals\n \n Three American supplied [Caterpillar], remote-controlled D-9 bulldozers smashed their way into the grounds of a small zoo in the Gaza Strip yesterday, busting open cages and demolishing walls.\n \n A menagerie of hundreds of exotic birds was detroyed. All but a few dozen birds escaped or were killed. Corpses of cockatiels, yellow-feathered lovebirds, and other animals litter the grounds as dogs pick at the remains. Foxes, wolves and raccoons are also on the loose, but their chances of surviving in the wild are slim.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=2943\n \n and\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=2944\n \n \n Israeli Sniper Picks Off Two Children\n \n Blows their brains out from adjacent rooftop, 100 metres away.\n \n Asma al-Mughair, 16, and her brother Ahmed, 13, died on the roof of their home in the Tel Sultan district of Rafah. Israeli Defence Force soldiers and tanks had just occupied the area.\n \n The children were shot by an Israeli sniper - Asma as she took in laundry, Ahmed as he fed the family pigeons.\n \n Dr Ahmed Abu Nkaria, deputy head of Rafah's tiny hospital, concluded that both children had been killed by single gunshots to the head.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=2948",

   "Cheney pledges alleigance to Israel... emoticon_xbouncer \n emoticon_xgood And I thought he was a bad addition to the Bush ticket. :) \n \n \n Siegfriedson,\n \n These sources are some of the most biased I have ever seen. If you beleive such ****, you are a fool.\n \n And to show it is biased I will give the following quotations from its website\n http://www.nationalvanguard.org\n \n \nMeanwhile, in the United States, stooge George W. Bush, facing a November defeat at the hands of the Jewish John Kerry,\n\n \n First off you can see its dislike of Bush, its presumption that Bush is going to lose the election when the candidates are in a dead heat, and it says John Kerry is Jewish which is the biggest load of propoganda I've ever heard.\n \n \nand that he was sorry he'd lied to the world in touting such lies in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq\n\n \n Colin Powell said no such thing.\n \n \nIt is increasingly clear now to even conservatives that the Iraq invasion was intended to serve the interests of Israel. \n \n \n Since when?\n \n \nIsrael, which is the world's only explicitly racially-organized state and which possesses the region's only ultimate weapons of mass destruction\n\n \n This shows extreme biased twoards the state of Israel as well as provides false information. Pakistan and Iran both either posess or are in the process of aquiring nuclear weapons.\n \n \n \n Your entire post is biased unfounded propoganda.",
