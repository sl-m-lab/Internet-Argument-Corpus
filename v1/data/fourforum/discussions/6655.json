   "An interesting take on the war: Al Qaeda Getting Tagged as Losers\n \n...(snip)...\n \n The successful referendum underscores just how impotent al Qaeda has become since the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001. Four years ago, al Qaeda was able to launch a coordinated attack that killed 3,000 people in the United States. Now, al Qaeda has proven unable to oppose the United States after American troops have liberated two countries in al Qaeda's backyard. These singular failures belie the claims of a quagmire coming from the mainstream media and critics of the Administration.

The fact remains that the United States is achieving its objectives, while al Qaeda is not - al Qaeda is even failing to prevent the American objectives from being met. By any objective standard, al Qaeda is losing the war on terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan.

   "While that is certainly an intersting editorial, it fails to touch on a few major points, such as the fact that in voting, the Iraqis categorically rejected Americna values. Our only \"voctory\" in Iraq is in the fact that we took a secular nation in the ME, and turned it into another fundamentalist nation. \n \n While AQ certainly fought the first elections, claiming that they were being manipulated by the US (which we know they were), the latest round has been supported by AQ. The Iraqis essentially just voted a constitution into place that turns them into another Iran. AQ loves Iran. \n \n Whether the Iraqi mess was an AQ victory or not is still open for debate. While they made very little difference as far as the war itself went (which may have to do with the fact that as far as we know, they only have ONE man there), their enrollment has tripled and the amount of money they have at their disposal has doubled since the thing started.\n \n What I really don't think is open for debate is that the US has lost. Our hopes and promises of essentially building a western nation on the ruin of Iraq has gone exactly the opposite direction. Iraq is now much closer to Iran as far as government and ideaology than it is to the US. \n \n We have halted construciton of our permanent bases there now that the Iraqis have made it very clear (and signed treaties with IRan and Syria stating as much) that they will never allow the US to use Iraqi bases to launch attacks against other ME nations, and that they will use military force to ensure it.\n \n \"Win\" implies that we gained something. I am just not seeing the gain here. \"Loss\" implies that you loose something. What has AQ lost? They have gained Iraq as an ally, gained memebr, gained money, and done it at virtually no cost to themselves.",

For god's sake Denmark the country with the less casualities got 4000 twice as much as weve lost in Iraq. Lets look at WWI the forgotten war. Germany lost 1,600,000, Austria-Hungary lost 922,000, US lost 58,480, Great Britain lost 658,700. Lets look at the american war of Southern Independence shall we? The United States lost 360,222, the Confederate States lost 258,000. I don't understand it when people say Ah man weve lost 2000 people. We should be dancing in joy! We have come such a long way. You know why the casualites are this low? Because our millitary is the Best in the world and a bunch of third world muslim countries arent gonna give us a hard time.

   "I see your point regarding the difference between the hard-core AQ and the militant Islam movement. I think Bush sees it also, since he declared war on terror and terrorism rather than just bin Laden and AQ. The whole point of the war on terror, which every civilized country should join, is to make sure that terrorism is never allowed to become an accepted or viable political tactic.\n \n If you've ever read Barbara Tuchman's The Proud Tower, a history of the 20+ years leading up to WWI, it's hard not to see some similarities between the anarchist movement of the late 19th century and the Islamist movement of today. Anarchists were divided into pseudointellectual theorists and speechmakers on one side, and the other side was the poor fools who listened to them and died in their missions of assassination. Likewise the Islamists have their pseudointellectual theorists in the background, and the poor fools who die in their suicide missions of terror. The biggest difference seems to be that the Islamists have far more powerful weapons available and are less discriminating in who they kill.\n \n In both cases, force is necessary to seek out and kill the useful XXXXXX (Lenin's phrase) before they can do their damage, and the disaffected people from whom the useful XXXXXX are drawn need to be shown that there is another, less violent, way to achieve their goal of being part of a global society.",

We KNOW absolutly that if AQ is using the cell based resistance structure we dveloped, this has not hurt them at all. That was the point fo the structure...you can lop off 65% of it from ANYWHERE without destroying functionality. \n \n In reality, AQ had about 35% of their strength in Afghanistan, and we only managed to neutralize about 25% of that.

We have done this to minimize US troop casaulties. Unfortunatly, these are tactics that net you a high number of civilian casualties (in fact, US troops were prohibited form using these tactics in areas populated by civilians until George Bush issued a standing order as the head of our military allowing it). \n \n For all the bluster and BS that the US public has been fed abotu how great our smart munitions are, it is easy for us to blow up a single office building, but almost impossible to blow up a single house. A cruise misssile strikign a house will tkae out all the houses around it as well. You would have to have one hell of a lot of terrorists stacked in that house for you to end up with more dead terrorists than civilians. \n \n Our \"decapitation\" strikes proved to be one of the biggest follies of the war. These were \"precision\" strikes targeted at individuals. I thikn the most famous of these idiotis moves was when a B1-B dropped 4 JDAMs (2000lbs) on a restaurant in downtown baghdad where Saddam Hussein was supposed to be eating. This strike killed 18 civilians and injured over 100, but Saddam was not anywhere close to the area.\n \n the JDAM is our most popular bomb for single target precision strikes. In a commercial setting, you can use several with minimal damage due to the heavyweight construction of most commercial buildings (concrete and cinderblock, etc...) In a residential neiborghood, a JDAM will take out half a block. We have used over 4000 of them since the start of the war in residential areas in \"precision strikes\" against insurgents.\n \n We have used these tactics in order to decrease the number of flag draped coffins on the evening news. Instead of using dangerous tactics, like ground combat, to take on our enemies, we hide like old women in our fortified positions and rain death on the civilian population from 20,000 ft.\n \n I for one have taken my medals off the wall. I am ashamed to have ever been involved with an organization (the US military) that uses such cowardly tactics. Frankly, as far as I am concerned, any soldier currently serving who is supporting these tactics is a dishonorable coward who should die a cowards death. US civilains who are supporting these cowardly and dishonorable tactics deserve the same.\n \n There will be payback for our chickenshit antics, and people like you, who are allowing our government to get away with this, will once again wine about how we are beign unfairly attacked without cause. It is amazing to me how cowardly and short sighted the American public is. Cowardly becuase they allow the deaths of tens of thousands of civilains half a world away for some small measure of percieved safety, and short sighted because theyf ail to see that these tactics will breed more enemies with even more reason to attack and kill us. I will add \"Stupid\" to that as well, becuase I can only imagine that people somhow feel that there is some way to defeat a cell based resistance network, despite the fatc that it has never, ever been done before, and the fact that there is no analyst I am aware of who has suggested that it will be possible to do so now, OR, that people believe that our billions in homeland security money is actually goignt o prevent attacks. the millions of illegal aliens who wander in and out of this country every years should shed a little light on the odds of keeping terrorists out.",

For god's sake Denmark the country with the less casualities got 4000 twice as much as weve lost in Iraq. Lets look at WWI the forgotten war. Germany lost 1,600,000, Austria-Hungary lost 922,000, US lost 58,480, Great Britain lost 658,700. Lets look at the american war of Southern Independence shall we? The United States lost 360,222, the Confederate States lost 258,000. I don't understand it when people say Ah man weve lost 2000 people. We should be dancing in joy! We have come such a long way. You know why the casualites are this low? Because our millitary is the Best in the world and a bunch of third world muslim countries arent gonna give us a hard time.

If you are the mother or father of one of the men or women who was killed, you might take a different stance. I doubt many of these families who have lost loved ones are jumping up and down in the streets about the low death toll. The only difference is we have a lot fewer families who have lost loved ones in thisw war as compared to other wars in our past. This however does not diminish the pain of those who have lost friends or loved ones. \n \n \"No man is an island, entire of itself;\n every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main;\n if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less,\n as well as if a promontory were,\n as well as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were;\n any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind;\n and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;\n it tolls for thee.\"\n \n -John Donne, 1623\n \n \n \n And making a comparison between the civil war, WWI, or WWII is really stupid.

Our situation since Abu-al-Faraj is good by the grace of God, but many of the lines have been cut off. Because of this, we need a payment while new lines are being opened.

The second stage: Establish an Islamic authority or amirate, then develop it and support it until it achieves the level of a caliphate over as much territory as you can spread its power in Iraq, i.e., in Sunni areas. . . . The third stage: Extend the jihad wave to the secular countries neighboring Iraq . The fourth stage: ...[This is ] the clash with Israel , because Israel was established only to challenge any new Islamic entity. . . .

The link between Iran and Iraq is a simple one. Iran wants the US out of Iraq because they know that they could be next, especially if they continue making noises about their nuclear program.\n\n \n Iran and Iraq have been enemies for a lot of years, their biggest divide essentially beign that IRaq, as a seculr satte, was seen as a threat to the religous rulers of Iran. Now we have removed the secular governmetn of Iraq and an islamic one has been installed in its stead. Chalabi has long been a friend of Iran (if you will remember, he was spying for them), and the Dawa party is funded and controlled by Iran.\n \n \n If we had not invaded Iraq, Iran would be in the same situation it was in before where the majority of their military assets were staged for defense against Iraq. With Iraq as their new ally, and the weapons restrictions against Iraq essentially lifted, Iran is likely to become the most powerful nation in the ME, especially now that they essentially control Iraq. \n \n We supported saddam with weapons and trainign for years because we feared Iran as a regional power. Now we have handed them the ME. Iran wants the Us out of Iraq? Doubtful. After all, with Iraq set to become little mroe than an Iranian sattelite state, and with the US actively backing the (loyal to IRan) shia as the lesser of 2 evils, I think it is pretty unlikely that Iran wants anythign fo the sort. They want a stable Iraq, and a rebuilt Iraq, and most importantly, a well armed IRaq.\n \n As far as AQs ability to set up a cat house withotu it being bombed, who knows? In reality, all we really know about AQ is that they are still out there, have more men, and more money than they ever have before. The bulk of AQ was never staged in Afghanistan. They have always been sread throughout the middle east, northern africa, asia, and Europe. Since our little escapade in Iraq, Britain is the only country besides the US on the planet that is actively huntin AQ members for us. Other countries have essentialyl said \"unless they do something criminal here, they are welcome to plan the demise of the US as much as they like\". \n \n As far as I can tell, the majority of AQs goals are being met. They wanted an islamic state in IRaq, they got it. They wanted to combine power int he ME, they got it. They wanted to bleed the US financially, they got that, too. \n \n Now.....what has the US gotten that we wanted again?",

If not, then shut up and don't talk about things you don't know about. Those two thousand troops (My brother's comrades in arms, for the record) died for a lie, and it's insensitive to an obscene extent for you to marginalize their deaths. And also: As time goes on, warfare evolves. World War I had so many casualties because the people were stuck in trenches, diseases ran rampant, and many soldiers were killed unnecessarily, like in the Dardanelles or at Gallipoli.\n Dancing in joy... From your post I can only deduce that you're an utter fool. Our boys are dying over there for a complete lie, and you want to dance for joy. And what's this load of bollocks about how third world muslim nations won't give us a hard time? Last time I checked, Iraq was giving us a hard time. You're the typical arrogant American that epitomizes what those people hate about this country, do you know that? You exude this aura of \"I'm an American, part of the greatest nation on Earth, and if you don't like it, we'll bomb you into oblivion.\" \n Also, we lost a war to vietnam, didn't we?\n I thought so.\n\n \n I have a good friend that I've known since his kids were knee-high to a grasshopper.

I'd suspect that most servicemen in Iraq don't believe that they're there because of a lie because they see a democracy being created in front of their eyes and they're damned proud to be a part of it. It's statements like yours that attempt to cheapen their sacrifice.

And I know many true conservatives who also feel Iraq was a mistake of gargantuan proportions, Saddam or no Saddam. Their service is a volunteer situation, based on the lie of WMDs being the reason to invade and occupy Iraq backed by a prison sentence if they refuse to perform. Considering their line of work, and it is basically a job, are you actually surprised at their lack of consideration that we made a big, fat mistake?\n \n I'm not a fan of invading any sovereign nation that hasn't attacked us.

I don't think so. \n \n\n glad you brought that up. WE imposed the sanctions on iraq, severely restricting his access to the export and import of goods and effectively crippling iraq's industry. in an act of defiance, saddam decided to let the people starve. the UN did nothing to relieve the tension of the sanctions, but slammed them tighter. and now you say that saddam was a bad man because under the unreasonable sanctinos imposed upon him, even the cries of starving iraqis wouldnt budge the UN. damn he's a bad guy\n\n Where have you been? SH was diverting the OFF revenue for his own personal use. If he hadn't have diverted the OFF revenue, his people would have been able to eat. As for \"WE\", I hope that you meant the UN, not just the US. If that's the case, then I would agree with that statement.\n \n\n unless you mean ben-wah balls i dont know what youre talking about. he attacked a weakened and defenceless country while letting bin laden and the greater part of al qaeda run free because they were too difficult to pursue. bush shrugged off the hunt for bin laden withing 3 months of 9/11, and thats after stalling for 2 months before going into afghanistan. talk about ballsy\n\n Well, far be it from me to defend GW2, but removing SH was the right thing to do. It should have occurred a decade earlier, however, so I'd say that GW2 had the balls that Daddy didn't.",
