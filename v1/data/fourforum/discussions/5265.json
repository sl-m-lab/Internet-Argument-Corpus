The cultural importance of evolution theory is therefore immeasurable, forming as it does the centerpiece, the crowning achievement, of the naturalistic view of the world, the final triumph of the secular thesis which since the end of the middle ages has displaced the old naive cosmology of Genesis from the western mind. The twentieth century would be incomprehensible without the Darwinian revolution. The social and political currents...[that] have swept the world in the past eighty years would have been impossible without its intellectual sanction. It is ironic to recall that it was the increasing secular outlook in the nineteenth century, which initially eased the way for the acceptance of evolution, while today it is perhaps the Darwinian view of nature more than any other that is responsible for the agnostic and skeptical outlook of the twentieth century. What was once a deduction from materialism has today become its foundation. The influence of evolutionary theory on fields far removed from biology is one of the most spectacular examples in history of how a highly speculative idea for which there is no really hard scientific evidence can come to fashion the thinking of a whole society and dominate the outlook of an age. Considering its historic significance and the social and moral transformation it caused in western thought, one might have hoped that Darwinian theory was capable of a complete, comprehensive and entirely plausible explanation for all biological phenomena from the origin of life on through all its diverse manifestations up to, and including, the intellect of man. That it is neither fully plausible, nor comprehensive, is deeply troubling. One might have expected that a theory of such central importance, a theory that literally changed the world, would have been something more than metaphysics, something more than a myth. Ultimately the Darwinian theory of evolution is no more nor less than the great cosmogenic myth of the twentieth century. Like the Genesis based cosmology it replaced, and like the creation myths of ancient man, it satisfies the same deep psychological need for an all embracing explanation for the origin of the world which has motivated all the cosmogenic myth makers of the past, from the shamans of primitive peoples to the ideologues of the medieval church. The truth is that despite the prestige of evolutionary theory and the tremendous intellectual effort directed towards reducing living systems to the confines of Darwinian thought, nature refuses to be imprisoned. In the final analysis we still know very little about how new forms of life arise. The 'mystery of mysteries' - the origin of new beings on earth - is still largely as enigmatic as when Darwin set sail on the Beagle.\"\n Michael Denton - avowed agnostic, anti-Creationist, author, medical doctor, biologist, and scientist\n \n Michael Ruse:Now, for the first time, one could confidently suspend belief in any kind of God. The Natural development of organisms explains everything, most especially adaptation. Even if you did not want to become a full-blown atheist, you could become what Darwin's already mentioned supporter, T.H. Huxley, labeled an 'agnostic', neither believer nor disbeliever (Huxley, 1900). However, excluding or distancing God in this fashion raises with some urgency the major problems of philosophy. If God (perhaps) does not exist, wherein lie the guarantees of knowledge and of truth?  Possibly all is subjective illusion. If God does not exist, wherein lies the force of morality? Why should we not do precisely what we please, cheating and lying and stealing, to serve our own ends? Dry answers by philosophers aiming for purely secular answers tended not to convince.",

I recall that the cliffs are bascailly calcium carbonate. calcium carbonate \"rock\" cannot from under such rapid deposits. It must be laid down layer by layer over millions of years. Not to mention that if all of the species existed at the same time, they all would be represented in every layer. That doesn't occur. As the cliffs rise, new species appear, that's a simple observation. Hence as time goes on, new mutations cause specation. What hydralic system?

Is that some sort of creationists lingo that is meant to attack evolution when ti has no meaning? \n \n \n\n The fact that there are different type of critters that are somewhat seperated by species is evidence , it does not necessarilly prove anything other that they are there and they are dead.\n\n \n But the similar bone structure, DNA makeup, patterns of birth, niches, as well as growth cycles all lend evidence that they are related. Not to mention that the species that are dead share many of the same traits as the species that are alive, with the exception that the living day ones have new physical traits that the old did not. \n \n \n\n Evidence and proof are not the same thing\n\n \n But in this case it is. That's rich comming from a creationist who's believe has no proof or evidence whatsoever. \n \n \nA sign laying on the ground is evidence. It could mean a strong gust of wind blew it down or it just got hit by a car.\n\n \n A sign with a big dent in the shape of a fender? :) \n \n \n\n You say that the extreme purity is not relevant because it raises serious question to your gradualism theory. There is no known senario that would cause this to happen. It seems only reasonable to expect that there would be a tremendous amount of impurities .What would cause this?\n Science is supposed to question everything , you ignore everything that does not support your theory.\n\n \n And you are clearly using selective reading. Evolution has holes, that's a given. You're trying to prove that one hole makes the entire thing wrong. That is fraud in its highest class, which makes you a hypocrite for attacking others on honesty. So what is evolution can't explain that right now, That doesn't mean it's wrong. Evolution is a work in theory. Merely because it lacks the answer now does not mean everything is false. Math cannot currently deal with several quatuman phenomna. Under your logic, all of math is wrong. \n \n \n\n Again you show the basic dishonesty of your education. Getting fat is evolving is that what you mean? emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n And you shown your stupidity. Evolution includes micro and macro. You cannot remove one and then delcare the whole thing is wrong. \n \n \n\n It is patently dishonest that you must accept macroevolution if you accept microevolution.\n\n \n I'm not saying that. I'm saying it's patently dishonest to remove microevolution from evolution and the declare it's all wrong. Micro and macro are key parts. You cannot simply just take out and say what's left is evolution and then say it's all wrong. Evolution is a packaged deal. What you seem to be declaring wrong is your own version of evolution, which makes you dishonest and similar to the flaming fraud of Hovind. \n You will never be able to seperate reality from the fairy tale you live in. \n Anyone who does not even take the time to learn about science is going to declare science and evolution fairy tales. \n \n \n\n Thank you for showing you have no ability to reason for yourself. That your ethics are non existent.\n\n \n Considering I answered no and contricted your idea, as well as proved you to be a fraud on several occasions, that makes you a flaming hypocrite. \n \n \nFor continually spouting the party line-If you don't believe in evolution you must think the world is flat.\n\n \n Where Did I say this? oh yes, never in that context. Which makes you a fabricator,. \n \n \nYou are not allowed to believe in microevolution which is observable unless you believe in macroevolution which is science fiction.\n\n \n lol. You are trying to make your own version of evolution and then declare it wrong. Would you remove the key workings of algebra and then declare the idea to be false? No. it's stupid. \n \n \n\n Guess what -if you believe the world made itself there is an echo when you think. Think about the process of evolution that caused the caterpillars that were \"more fit\" to turn themselves into a liquid. That should be a stimulating exercise for you.\n\n \n Do you even UNDERSTAND EVOLUTION? \n \n \n\n Creation does not need to be defended. It is a self evident truth.\n\n \n Alright, explain why there isn't a single bit of evidence that supports creation.\n \n \n\n Evolution on the other hand defends itself with wild and dishonest extrolations of the evidence, outright frauds and the murder of innocent human beings for museum displays.\n\n \n lol. Murder of innocents? Please, prove this. Wild and dishonest? Oh yes, the \"annimals all fit on the ark.\"",

On a side note, this is generally how science works in general - particularly in mathematics, logic, and the empirical sciences. You assume some things and work from those assumptions. \n \n I would disagree with characterizing the faith required to believe in God as philosophical. Philosophy is, by the nature of the enterprise, critical. Faith in God is, by the nature of faith, uncritical. Faith is a feeling of hope apart from critical investigation. My point is that \"a philosophical sense of faith\" is a contradiction in terms, and misleading because the faith being appealed to is prior to any critical analysis or understanding of that faith. \n \nIt ignores all the empirical evidence backing up evolution.

   "For someone who picks and chooses what evolution is and then changes that as suits his needs, you need to learn what honesty means before making comments about other's. \n\n I pick and choose? I would love to have agreed upom definitions for variation within species and macroevolution. It is you who refuse to seperate them. not me.\n \n\n Then according to you microevolution is not part of evolution at all. Yet obviously you are wrong as microevolution is a key fumdenetal part of evolution. \nYou cannot stop spouting the party line and playing semantics. I will say this one more time and if you bring up this nonsense again I will add you to my growing ignore list.\n  Creationist came up with the idea of natural selection not Darwin \n Please don't spout that BS anymore. Microevolution is a poor choice of words to describe natural selection which is observable , it is scientific.\n Macroevolution is a religious belief , it cannot be observed.\n \n \n\n And when these specific traits, as seen is several cave spider and fly species in hawaii produce a species that does not mate with similar species and fills a new niche, is that not evolution? \nIt is a change so it is evolution. It has nothing to do with flies and spiders evolving into elephants. They are still flies and spiders and allways will be flies and spiders.\n You don't seem to be able to seperate observational science from your religious beliefs.\n \n\n \n Incredibly stupid. Cows did not exist at the time. How can a modern species evolve into another modern species? That is a clear sign you do not understnad evolution. Apparently you don't understand how DNA partengage trees work and how they show a lineage in descent. \n\n Incredibly dishonest, I said pick your mammal. The latest BS was about the Pakecitus. I prefer cows because that is funnier. Wanna tell me the pakecitus is the missing link for mammals to whales or do you have a new one?\n It is you who does not know what you are saying.\n There is no such thing as a DNA parentage tree in science, only in fairy tales. Human beings share 50% of their DNA with bannanas. Are they your ancestor or are you theirs? \n \n\n You are very similar to the fraud known as Hovid. You make your OWN belief about what evolution is and then declare it wrong. You clearly are taking microevolution out of evolution and then declaring the whole thing wrong just to avoid declaring what is factually true to you wrong. Is microevolution part of evolution or not to you? \n\n I think you mean Hovind who is not a fraud and you are not familiar with him at all. I have met met and he is a smart guy. I don't agree with everything he says but to call someone a fraud because you disagree with him shows your lack of character.\n There must be an echo when you think. All Creationist accept natural selection , no creationist accepts macro. Natural selection is observable macro is pure imagination. If you want to agrue that it is true fine but don't be a mental midget and keep saying Creationist take microevolution out of evolution. Thats all there is according to observation. You can believe in feathered dinosaurs if you like but like the tooth fairy it is not science, it is a fairy story.\n \n\n Fallacy, pysgenetic. Actually you were likely indoctrinated, as you take creation to be factually true and show virtually no knowledge of what evolution is. How can i be indoctrinated when I have forced evolution in the lab on several occasions using viruses as vectors for bacterial gene injection causing several new types of bacteria to emerge? Indoctrination is caused by a 2nd party. i did the expirement by myself. Therefore I could NOT have been indoctrinated. \n\n I have no clue where you found the word pysgenetic, did you make it up?\n I know what evolution is . It is whatever you choose it to be at the time.\n You are the one who has no clue what a creationist thinks or believes. You equate disagreement with misunderstanding. I have heard so many definitions of particles to people I am sick of hearing them but I understand them all.\n I just don't believe a word of any of them beyond variation within kinds of animals\n You have forced evolution in the lab? . Did the bacteria emerge as bacteria or tadpoles. If they were tadpoles I will renounce my faith and become an atheist. If they were still bacteria I will yawn and wonder how it is you can live in the fairy story you do.\n You were indoctrinated if you think changes in bacteria that can be observed proves fish turned into amphibians which cannot.\n It is not something I believe would have occurred to you without outside influence.\n\n No, as society has actively kept abnormally large amounts of inferior genes in the pool. We have artifically retarded evolution with a belief in the value of life to the point of standstill. Of course other species which do not have such restrictions are evolving. \n\n So you agree with Hitler and we should get rid of the undesirables?\n Are you a Nazi? You sound like a Nazi and you think like a Nazi .\n Name an animal that is changing it's fundamental form such as a lizard evolving an avian lung. You have to keep your eyes open because that had to take place in less than 4 minutes.\n\n \n *sigh*. The question assumes you are smart enough to realize that evolution is true.\n\n That begs the question how would you know?\n\n Looks like I'm slicker then you think I am and you're not as clever as you make yourself out to be.\nThat may be true but since I consider you as intellectually gifted as an earthworm it dosen't mean that much that you are as intellectually gifted as an earthworm does it? \n \n\n That's silly. I recall that the cliffs are bascailly calcium carbonate. calcium carbonate \"rock\" cannot from under such rapid deposits. It must be laid down layer by layer over millions of years. Not to mention that if all of the species existed at the same time, they all would be represented in every layer. That doesn't occur. As the cliffs rise, new species appear, that's a simple observation. Hence as time goes on, new mutations cause specation. What hydralic system? Oh yes the hydralic compressors of the ancient era? emoticon_rolleyes Creation is a giant lie and you believe it. \n\n As you recall? They are chalk , trillions of tiny sea creatures , diatoms . It is used to polish cars with . Are you really so stupid you don't know what hydraulic sorting means?\n Please read before you reward me with your ignorance.\n Ancient hydraulic compressors ? Your funny, in the head.\n \n \n\n \n Good luck with that one. It's proven to be false. \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hovind/howgood-yea2.html\n True, Hydraulic sorting does occur, it just takes a long time, much longer then 6,000 years. What are you talking about? diamateous isn't even a word. Is that some sort of creationists lingo that is meant to attack evolution when ti has no meaning? \n \n\n Diatomaceous Earth\n http://www.biconet.com/crawlers/DE.html\n Talk origins is an atheistic website their opinion is not proof of anything.\n Hydraulic sorting depending on the amount of material to be sorted can take minutes to months not thousands of years.\n A minute ago you said it required ancient hydraulic compressors. You are a twit and make this up as you go along.\n \n\n But the similar bone structure, DNA makeup, patterns of birth, niches, as well as growth cycles all lend evidence that they are related. Not to mention that the species that are dead share many of the same traits as the species that are alive, with the exception that the living day ones have new physical traits that the old did not. \n \n\n That means nothing. Bananas and humans share 50% of their DNA. This is just mindless babble. The only facts that we can disern from comparing old fossils to present day animals is statis is the overwhelming rule not the exception . And of course that many animals are now extinct.\n [QUOTE]\n . \n \n\n And you are clearly using selective reading. Evolution has holes, that's a given.

Evolution includes micro and macro. You cannot remove one and then delcare the whole thing is wrong. \n\n That is your definition , at least todays . Please be serious.\n \n\n I'm not saying that.

Wanna tell me the pakecitus is the missing link for mammals to whales or do you have a new one?\nWhales are mammals, you incredible doofus. Yes, \"cows\" are funnier because the idea is so stupid or incredibly dishonest. Of course you have no idea why Pakicetus (note spelling, you semiliterate dunce) was recognized as an a transitional to whales. You see, there are certain characteristics in the limbs of artiodactyls that are also found in Pakicetus, Ichthyolestes, Ambulocetus, and Rodhocetus, such as the astragalus, calcaneum, navicular, and cuboid. These characteristics aren't found in other mammals. Additionally, there is another characteristic that links all of these animals together that is still present in the modern whale. If you know what you are talking about, you will be aware of that characteristic and can explain it for us. Other transitionals were Bahlanistes, Rhodocetus, Takracetus, Gaviocetus, Basilosaurus, and Dorudon.\n \n Please don't disappoint again by failing to explain the common characteristic of all of these animals, as well as the Mysticetes and the Odontocetes, a characteristic that only occurs and has occurred in whales, all whales. If you have educated yourself enough to reject Packicetus as a transitional, then you have to be aware of this characteristic and can even point it out on the photos of Packicetus.\n \n I suspect that you will again be embarrassed by your inability to discuss the topic with any intelligence.\n \nI think you mean Hovind who is not a fraud and you are not familiar with him at all. I have met met and he is a smart guy. I don't agree with everything he says but to call someone a fraud because you disagree with him shows your lack of character.\nNope. Hovind is a fraud and you aren't smart enough to realize that he has duped you.\n \n By the way, what does it mean when you say, \"I have [b]met met[/b[ and...?\" Is that just another demonstration of you semi-literacy?",

   "Sorry, that doesn't track. Creationism is based on a organized religious preconception. Those who propose that evolution does not exist in the name of creationism as layed out in the bible are guilty of pseudo-science.\n Sure, I'd agree that 'young-earth' creationists that rely solely on the Bible are XXXXXX because they interpret the Bible literally without reference to other evidence. There are even young earth creationists, however, who do take into account the evidence and find it wanting - the problems with dating fossils, for example, is something that they tend to bring up. \n \nHowever creationists do exactly the opposite. The whole point of creationism is the presuposition that there is a God.\n Indeed. But if we're discussing a metaphysical issue rather than a spiritual issue, then we can proceed with science rather than religion because such metaphysical postulates need not be the subject of proof.\n \nI think we are talking past each other. You keep making my point for me. Mathematical theories are published by theoretical scientists, and then experimental scientists go out to prove or disprove the theory. That is how science has progress forever! Whether you have a religious bias or not, once a theory matches observer data, you must re-assess your old assupmtions.\n I think it's the language. When you say \"mathematical theory\" do you mean a theory about mathematics or do you mean a theory of some natural science using a mathematical model? \n \nFact vs. Fiction\n or rather Fact vs. Speculation\n Again not exactly. You're assuming that facts are only operant in phenomenal science, as though we can't have spiritual facts, moral facts, epistemological facts, etc. Certainly these facts are only facts in virtue of a family resemblance between them, but that goes back to the point that both sides are misinterpreting the other side's facts to be equivalent to their own.\n \nMathematics isn't its own proof, and logic is subject to common rules of experience. A = B = C, vs A=B|C.\n True, but I don't remember claiming otherwise. Mathematics can be proved by quantificational logics supplemented by set theory. Logic itself is not subject to proof, but rather to formal requirements. \n \nI have had many experiences in my physics degree in CU where my previous mathematical proofs needed to conform to the empirical truth of the data, as much as I had vis versa. Mathematics is a underpinning of our universe, however to be a physics it must conform to empirical data. Thats why mathematical system modeller get paid so much.\n I don't think I would go so far as to make the claim that mathematics is an underpinning of our universe, although I might suggest that it is a useful tool for describing that universe. \n \n Once we have laid down the set of objects that we wish to describe the universe as, and the tools with which we will arrange them, then we can proceed with metaphysics. \n \n If we're going to be rigourous about it, we analyze those tools formally so that peer review is possible, and we proceed with the pure sciences. \n \n If we're dealing with phenomenal objects, then we introduce notions of empirical proof to our metaphysical models that can be treated rigourously, and modelled using the pure sciences, and proceed with the natural sciences.\n \n Certainly the natural world is such that we may constantly rejig the formally defined models that we use to map the phenomenal world, but it's also such that we may arrive at situations that we cannot formally represent (such as the problem of the excluded middle in quantum mechanics, which you've probably heard of). \n \n So notice that I'm not just talking about the models that we use to represent natural phenomena, but revising even the formal systems that we use to build those models (a position you may know as 'naturalized epistemology'). \n \n \nOk you are just being arguementative now. You know what I mean.\n I do know what you mean. I think...;) You mean that science is progressive while theology is static. Science, as a project is certainly expansive, but not be virtue of any linear progression. It's basically a process of 'reflective equilibrium' that assumes the phenomenal world to be uniform. Theology is rather the same way in that it expands through a never-ending process of reflective equilibrium. It's why both scientists and theologians can produce new work as horizons get expanded and gaps get filled. \n \n The real difference is the application. Some of us, for whatever reason, seem to think that developing amazing technologies to interface with the natural world is somewhat more useful than developing amazing technologies to interface with the spiritual world. Mind you, the Buddhists have managed to do some amazing things with meditation...\n \n So there is a pragmatic concern in both subjects, but each subject treats a different concern. Some people just aren't concerned with spirituality. Other people just don't care about natural phenomena. C'est la vie. \n \nRecursions are progressive, iterations are circular.\n Yes, that's why I said 'recursive'. \n \nNo, actually it spurs competition. Science thrives on alternative ideas, and experiemental scientists are all too eager to create experiements that disprove an alternate theory. I've seen it!\n I never said it didn't spur competition. The problem is that it tends to over-emphasize the role of proof while obscuring what that proof is in relation to. Take 'critical experiments' for example - supposedly you can directly test two theories with one experiment. But these depend on the theories being commensurate such that they either share all auxiliary assumptions and framing logics or test sets of phenomena. \n \n It's a bit like the phenomena of being separated by a common language in that regard - two people miscommunicating because they're engagin in two different language games with the same components - very busy and interesting, but not terribly constructive.\n \nThe religious hierarchy of any one religion is always well versed in social science and indoctrination techniques. Why else would the invention of hell be necessary? Don't think religion doesn't use technos to produce results. There is a learning curve to controlling populations.\n They're not well versed in social science (not even social scientists are!), but they are well versed in social technologies. Everyone uses technology, and given enough luck anyone can invent a new technology. \n \n But contrary to the agnostic view that organized religion is a form of social control, I'd point out that every way of interacting with other people requires that we play roles and express social power. It's much easier to interact with other people when you can exert power over them. It's not just religion, but politics, culture, languages, sports, sex, whatever. And the abuse of those power relations happens everywhere - the boy who cried wolf being a typical warning against a form of such abuse.\n \n It's not the case that religions are just there to take advantage of the gullible and the needy, much like it is not the case that science is a new religion. Different subjects that need to be treated according to their particular sets of rules. Leave such category mistakes to the \"internet-educated\" - they need something to keep their wooly minds occupied. \n \nI know about philosophy of science. Come on...that is childish. Ask me a question to verify.\nI know you're not just ranting, but the language barrier is still coming down. More to the point the philosophy of science is quite diverse. I'd be interested to know which definition of 'pseudo-science' you subscribe to though.",

   "Not being able to breed does not prove anything .\nYes it does. If two organisms are unable to interbreed, they are separate species. Reproductive isolation is the definitive characteristic of two species.\n \nDarwin thought the Galopagos Finches could not interbreed but they can and do.\nNow you are lying. I have explained this to you before and you ran away from that discussion. To repeat your error now is an intentional lie and demonstrates low moral character. Darwin did not recognize the Galapagos (note spelling - something else that has been pointed out to you) finches were separate species. That was done after Darwin returned to England by the Christian scientist and anti-evolutionist, Richard Owen. Further, of the 14 (maybe 15) species of finch, interbreeding happens between only two sets of two species. In each case then interbreeding pairs are from the same genus. DNA analysis has shown these species to be closely related and therefore only recently separated. The rest of the species are reproductively isolated and do not interbreed with any of the other species.\n \nIt is still cited as proof of evolution. So if they cannot breed it proved macroevolution and if they can breed it proves macroevolution.\n If they survive it proves macro if they go extinct it proves macro.

However, Olson's claim is that birds did not evolve from theropod dinosaurs but rather directly from some archosaurian ancestor, the same as the crocodilians. You aren't helping your argument with this.\n \n\"Paleontologists have tried to turn Archaeopteryx into an earth-bound, feathered dinosaur. But it's not. It is a bird, a perching bird.
