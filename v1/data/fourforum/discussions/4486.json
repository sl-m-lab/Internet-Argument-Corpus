   "So, are we a Christian Nation? Yes? No? Partially? I have my opinion but i'd like to let someone else shout out their stance first.\n\n \n I haven't bothered to research any current numbers because I assume you don't particularly want just statistical contributions ? So here's an outsider's opinion based only on \"general knowledge\".\n \n As a broad generalisation, I would say that America is at least nominally a thoroughly Christian nation. Beyond the large number of Christian activists - a majority of which is supposed to have given Mr Bush his second term - there are, I would guess, a majority who would describe themselves as Christians: but whether this means that their lives are guided by strict Christian principles or that they take much notice of instructions from the clergy, is impossible to say. I suspect not. Christianity in America does not have the implacable character that, say, Islam does in other nations. \n \n With the possible exception of Ireland (and with the above qualifications), I think America is probably the most actively Christian nation in Western civilisation. \n \n On a minor point: the United States Treasury seems to be operating upon the assumption that Americans are Christians - if the \"In God We Trust\" slogan that appears on US currency refers only to the God of Christian people (and I believe it does).",

It must be TROO christianity since I see so many christians who are willing to do so. Isn't it funny how often a remark like \"I'm not one to judge, but...\" is followed by judgement. It must be one of the tenets of TROO christianity.\n \n Actually, the largest single religious demonination in the U.S. is Roman Catholicism. The Protestant sects are so fractured the any single one is almost insignificant. I think that the Southern Baptists are second - the TROO christian sect that was formed after the Civil War so that Catholics, Jews, and blacks could be discriminated against. Of course, the KKK had its roots among the Southern Baptists.\n \n Its funny too, since the Baptists of colonial times were persecuted by other christian sects. The Baptists actually supported the adoption of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights that was officially opposed by most christian sects. For example, Patrick Henry in Virginia led the opposition to both in the Virginia legislature, and in fact had introduced a bill to levy a tax on all citizens in order to pay ministers of the state religion - Episcopaleanism. James Madison was primarily responsible for the defeat of Henry's bill (see Memorial and Remonstrance) and then introduced a bill (originally written by Jefferson) that abolished the state religion and established freedom of religion in Virginia (see The Virginia Act For Establishing Religious Freedom)\n \n And christians hold Henry up as an example as an example of a \"founding father\" to be admired. Funny that Henry had no part in writing the Articles of Confederation, the Constitution, or the Bill of Rights. He did favor a rebellion against the Crown some 20 years earlier, but that actually had nothing to do with the founding of the country. It seems that when a christian claims to be in favor of liberty and freedom it means that they are in favor of having the liberty and freedom to impose their religion on everyone by force of law.",

   "@ Alan\n \n Ah, yes, this is true. One could make an argument that the Vatican is merely a state within the nation of Italy. Allthough I suspect that there are real cultural difference as well between the average vatican citizen and the average italian citizen. First we have the level of faith, which is undoubtedly higher in the Vatican. Secondly, the papal state (or church state) has a long history of an political independancy. Once as large as the entire central italy, it has since shrinked into the tiny territory inside the city of rome (1861 is the exact date of this \"shrinkage\"). Thridly, the papal state has latin as one of their official languages (italian being the second). In addition, the Vatican also produces its own media.\n \n It is indeed a question as to what constitutes as a nation, but I`m inclined to say that the Vatican has their own nation, distict from the italian nation. Allthough not as pronounced as say Mexico and the US. But perhaps close to the distinction between Sweden and Norway.",

   "My first inclination was to ask for clarification. Does the question ask about whether many or most citizens of the U.S. are Christians, or is the question about whether our government is somehow based on or is it motivated by Christian principles.\n \n It seems that the question is more like the latter, only should the United States affirm Christianity or religion in general.\n \n Well, the writers of the Constitution were well aware of the religious wars among Christians in Europe. It was quite evident that when religion became a function of government, that it became more and more imporant which particular sect was considered the \"correct\" true religion. Even the writers of the Constitution held several different faiths, depending on from which state they came. They were very aware of the religious persecutions that were carried out in the American colonies. They realized the problems that would arise in trying to form a strong federal government that recognized a single state religion - which one? So they avoided the issue by forming a government that said nothing about religion and didn't mention God. The authority of the Constitution was derived from \"We the people...,\" and not from divine authority or holy scripture. In fact, the Godlessness of the Constitution was one of the reasons that the Constitution was openly opposed by most Christian churches, with the exception of the Baptists who realized that a government formed without a religious basis would be to their benefit - no federal taxes to finance religions that persecuted them.\n \n In these debates, those who claim that the U.S. was founded on Christian principles always point to the Declaration of Independence. They see their religion in the expressions used there, usually because they are willing to distort the meaning of the text. For example, in the first paragraph, Jefferson used the word \"God.\" However, in context it is clear that he was not refering to the Christian God. Jefferson declares that events have made it necessary for the people to assume a separate and equal station among the powers of earth and that it is the \"Laws of Nature and of Nature's God\" that entitle them to this separation. Such references to nature were common in humanist writing and \"God\" is given second billing, being subject to the same laws that control nature. Also note that it is a respect to the opinions of mankind that motivates the declaration, not a duty to any god.\n \n In the next paragraph, Jefferson stated certain unalienable rights. Beyond the fact that the rights were considered to be self evident (not a matter of revelation by scripture), unalienable rights are not principles of Christianity anywhere. Individual rights have always been considered subject to the needs of the church. And of course, the statement of the equality of all men is intended as a direct response to the Christian idea that someone is, \"by the Grace of God, King.\" And of course, governments derive their powers from the consent of the governed, not from anyone's god, and the governed retain the right to change that government.\n \n But all of the above discussion is actually moot. The Declaration is not a founding document of this country. It is what it says it is, and nothing more - a declaration. Our first government was actually founded the the Articles of Confederation. When this government was recognized to be inadequate to the future needs of the country, the Continental Congress made itself the Constitutional Convention and assigned itself the task of writing a new Constitution.\n \n But even the \"Christian nation\" advocates are aware that God is not mentioned once in the Constitution. Instead it is \"We the People\" who \"ordain and establish\" the Constitution. Including the Bill of Rights, Jesus and God are not mentioned once, and religion is mentioned twice, both times in the form of prohibitions.\n \n So no, the United States is not a Christian nation.\n \n There is also the matter of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the United States and the Bey and Subjects of Tripoli of Barbary (known as the Treaty of Tripoli). This treaty was negotiated and written by Joel Barlow during Washington's 2nd term. Barlow had previously been appointed as Chaplain of the Continental Army by Washington. The treaty was approved by the Senate without a single dissenting vote and signed by President Adams. You may see some discussion that article 11 is not included in the Arabic version of this document and that that fact is somehow telling. However, the version ratified by the Senate and signed by Adams said the following:\n \"As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion;\"\n Keep in mind that the year was 1797 - the country was just over 8 years old. One might think that the Senate would be well aware of the intent of the founding fathers, especially since some of them were the founding fathers.",

   "I remember when I was a child in school learning about the first European settlers to come to this country. The first discussed were always the Pilgrims and the landing at Plymouth Rock. The history books told about the hardships, the help and friendship from the natives, and the first Thanksgiving. We were taught that these devout Christians came to this country in order to establish religious freedom and to escape religious persecution in England and how they founded the Massachusetts Bay Coloney. What a great story, always tied to the lesson of the religious freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution. I think every school child studied these stories in school. In following units we learned about the settlements at Jamestown and eventually other colonies, without so much mention of religious freedom, but with more emphasis on the hardship part - pioneering spirit and all of that. \n \n I was surprised when I grew to adulthood and learned that it was a load of bunk. I was from the western U.S. and it was my wife and friends that taught me that I had been duped by my teachers (who probably didn't know any better) for all those years. You see, I actually lived in Massachusetts where they took the history of their state quite seriously. I found out that the Pilgrims didn't want to establish religious freedom as we understand it today. They sought to impose their religion on everyone in the colony, no exceptions. Those who disagreed and refused to practice Puritinism with the proper piety were either expelled from the colony (if they were lucky), or in some cases put to death. \n \n I also learned that the Pilgrims landed on the Cape first and spent a winter there before crossing Massachusetts Bay and landing at Plymouth Rock. \n \n When I learned this, I also looked into the settlement of other colonies and found that religious freedom was never an issue in most of them. Jamestown was purely a commercial venture from the beginning even though the colonists at Jamestown were required to be members of the Church of England. Georgia was used as a dumping ground for undesirables, but also with a Chruch of England established religion. It was a means of freeing up space in the over crowded prisons and relieving the Crown of the expense of caring for these people in prison. \n \n I was shocked when I learned that the line of idealized nonsense that I had been taught was nothing more than misguided propaganda. So I took the time to learn the true history of the settling of Massachusetts, as well as the origins of the ideals upon which this country was founded. I saw Plymouth Rock, now broken in two major pieces. I stood on the Lexington Green where the first minuteman fell, I walked along the road to Concord followed by the British Army. I stood where the British Army did and looked across the Concord Bridge, across which the second exchange of fire of the Revolution took place. Just to the left of the bridge is the grave of the first British soldier to die, so far from his home, left behind by the retreating British, and buried respectfully by the minutemen where he fell. I walked up the hill where the minutemen formed and walked the grounds of the house where the arms that the British sought were stored. I walked across the road to the house that was behind the British and saw a bullet hole near the front door. I saw the home of Louisa May Alcott, the original vines of the Concord grape entwined in a picket fence, Walden Pond, with a 'reproduction' of Thoreau's cabin, the Old Manse where Ralph Waldo Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne had once lived. I visited the \"House of the Seven Gables,\" and the grave of John Hancock. I found that these experiences, though moving for me, were regarded by Massachusetts natives with a more blas\u00e9 attitude. \n \n I don't doubt that the Puritins were quite sincere in the practice of their religion, although they were quite vicious in imposing it on others. I learned that in the south, religion was forced on others less vigorously and practiced with less fervor, a tradition that continued and had spread throughout the colonies by the time of the Revolution. A French visitor at the time of the Revolution observed that \"religious indifference is imperceptibly disseminated from one end of the continent to the other.\" Church attendance was mostly women, who were, of course, excluded from politics and other areas of secular practice. While the population was certainly not anti-Christian, certainly not Muslim or Buddhist, they were not particularly religious. Given the state religions they were at least nominally Christian. This explains the high percentages of Christians claimed by the \"Christian Nation\" crowd. It is well known among historians that only about 10 to 15 percent of the population were church members. Three of the books that I mentioned cite similar percentages, one as low as 8%, one as high as 16%. \n \n That is not to say that there were no Christians among the founding fathers, there were without a doubt. But they certainly wouldn't recognize the christianity of the modern fundamentalists. And the intellectual elite of the Revolutionary period were, for the most part, deists and humanists. They were also political leaders. As a result, the first 6 Presidents were clearly Deists or Unitarians. \n \n Nor am I saying that these educated men had no interest in the Bible. You can twist the view of Jefferson as you will, but you can't make him into a Protestant Evangelical who believed that Christianity was the only basis for morality. Nevertheless, Jefferson read the Bible and wrote about it. He even put together his own version, known as the Jefferson Bible, from which he cut every hint of magic and miracle, leaving only the teachings of Jesus. And of course, in spite of the claim of the 'Christian nation' crowd, Jefferson's phrase from the Declaration, \"the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God,\" was a clear effort to avoid a Christian reference. It is also clearly a reference to deism. \n \n But still, 'Christian nation' advocates hang their argument on that one mention of God, one of a Creator, and one of divine Providence to claim that there is somehow a Christian foundation to this nation. And yet, nature gets top billing, the Creator endowed unalienable rights (never a tenet of Christianity which was always willing to deny all rights to non-christians), and divine Providence isn't directly a reference to Christianity either. \n \n Moreover, the Declaration is a list of grievances. It is an enumeration of the \"causes of separation.\" It is not a document upon which this country was founded. And not one of the causes has any religious connotation. \n \n One might more rightly claim that the Articles of Confederation was the founding document. Except after only a few years it was realized that they were essentially unworkable. And, of course, 'Christian nation' advocates never cite the Articles of Confederation. So the Continental Congress appointed itself a committee of the whole to write a new constitution. Their right and obligation to do so was stated in the Declaration of Independence. \n...Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.\n And that's what they did. They formed a new government that is ordained and established by we the people. \n \n Nowhere in the Constitution is there any mention of God or Jesus. As I have mentioned before, there is only one mention of religion in the Constitution, and one in all of the Ammendments. Both of those are in the form of prohibitions. And for this reason the Constitution was opposed by the established churches. Sermons were preached in an effort to defeat the \"Godless\" Constitution. \n \n It is interesting to note that at the first session of the Constitutional Convention the Benjamin Franklin (a deist at best) moved that each session should begin with a prayer. Instead of a second to the motion, there was a motion to adjourn, which was duely seconded and passed. Thus, while the houses of Congress may vote to begin their sessions with a prayer, the Constitutional Convention did not. \n \n The provision in Article VI about \"no religious test\" was passionately debated in the state ratifying conventions, driven, of course, by the objections of Christians. But the provision was not debated in the Constitutional Convention. It was introduced by Charles Pinckney, governor of South Carolina, and was immediately referred to the Committee on Detail without debate. The report from the Committee on Detail made no reference to Pinckney's proposal. So Pinckney moved the motion from the floor. There was some short discussion, whereupon the motion was seconded and the question was called. The motion passed. While the exact vote was not recorded, James Madison recorded in his personal notes that North Carolina voted no and Maryland was split. \n \n What a remarkable event. In 1787, when the Constitution was written, 11 of the 13 states had a religious requirement for public office. One by one, they were abandoned or overthrown. All requirements for office were overthrown in a case before the Supreme Court from Maryland in which an atheist CPA was denied a license because he refused to take a religous oath to God. I can't remember the case, but if anyone wants to read the decision I'll try to find it. \n \n So if the question is if we are a nation founded on Christian principles, the answer is no. If the question is whether we have a lot of Christians in our nation, then yes. But our Constitution doesn't endorse or support any religion. And our government doesn't tell citizens what religion they should practice or how they should practice it.",
