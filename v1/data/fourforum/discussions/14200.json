   "\"In the United States in 2005, 37,460 white females were sexually assaulted or raped by a black man, while between zero and ten black females were sexually assaulted or raped by a white man.\n \n \"What this means is that every day in the United States, over one hundred white women are raped or sexually assaulted by a black man.\"\n FrontPage Magazine - The Truth of Interracial Rape in the United States\n \n \"According to the 2004 FBI National Crime Victimization Survey, in most instances of interracial crimes, the victim is white and the perpetrator is black. In the case of interracial murder for 2004, where the race of victim and perpetrator is known, more than twice as many whites were murdered by a black than cases of a white murdering a black. The failure of civil rights leaders, people like Jackson and Sharpton, as well as politicians to vocally condemn black-on-white crime -- and the relative silence of the news media in reporting it -- is not simply a matter of double standards. It's dangerous, for it contributes to a pile of racial kindling awaiting a racial arsonist to set it ablaze.\"\n Capitalism Magazine - Hiding Black Interracial Crimes\n \n A black stripper accused white members of the Duke Lacrosse team of raping her in 2006. The case received a huge amount of publicity. The accused were later cleared of the charges. Yet the media and civil rights leaders seem to pay a lot less attention to cases in which the victims are white and the perpetrators are black. They seem to be a lot more comfortable portraying blacks as being the victims of whites than the reverse.",

   "Oh absolutely.\n \n When it comes to a group of white college students stomping on a black dude, the media is all over it. But when a white person is heinously assaulted by someone of color or minority status the media is eerily silent, treating it like absolutely no crime was committed.\n \n It's a vicious double standard. If white people can be charged with hate crimes and racism, black people should be held to the same standard. Giving them a free pass just because they had hard times in the past isn't fair to the good of the country. It sends the wrong message to everybody.\n \n Afterall it was you who said the 14th Amendment requires laws to be applied in an even manner, or something like that. The laws against violence based on race are being applied in an uneven manner.",

While living in Hawaii, I saw a lot of racism. Some people had the attitude that it was okay to mistreat white people because white people overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and forced Hawaii to become part of the United States a long time ago. \n \n Looking at the illegal immigration issue, there is a history there too. Before the Mexican War (1846-1848) present day Arizona, Utah, Colorado, California, and New Mexico were Mexican territory. US President Ulysses S. Grant said that the Mexican War was \"one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation. It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory.\" \n So a lot of these Mexican immigrants are entering territory that the United States forcibly took from Mexico.",

He is hosting a town hall meeting about his beliefs. So does he have actual evidence that others were involved and has he tried going to the police with this evidence?
