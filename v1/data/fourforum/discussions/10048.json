   "I am sure everybody has seen the news about the Bear Stearns fund collapse. Something about that didn't set right with me. Merrill held an auction on many of those CDOs that they seized, yet the next day when Bear Stearns stepped up to bail out the fund, Merrill still seemed to have all that paper. How could they have auctioned an asset, and still be holding it? \n \n I finalyl found my answer buried on page 12 of various publications and managed to confirm it with an inside source who was involved.\n \n http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article2697970.ece\n \n \nWhen Merrill Lynch tried to auction assets seized from the Bear Stearns funds earlier this week, some attracted bids of just 30 per cent of their face value and Merrill declined to sell. Instead, it will now aim to deal directly with Bear Stearns, and the $3.2bn cash injection yesterday makes it likely that it will get more of its loans repaid. Barclays, which is understood to have lent about $300m to the funds, has always been in favour of a negotiated settlement rather than a fire sale. \n\n \n My source tells me that none of the offers they recieve on any of that CDO paper were higher than 45% of face value. Those were AAA rated bonds. The fear wa that if Merrill auctioned those bonds, they would actually have a market value attached which would force insititutions selling them take mark downs on them. Since they did not actually sell, that is not a problem YET. At some point, though, somebody is going to have to open market some of that paper and I think the Merrill auction gives us a pretty good preview of what we can expect when that happens.\n \n using assumed acquisition values, that paper is valued at over 1 trillion dollars. If those assumed values turn out to be 60% too high in the face of an open market sale, the fallout will be severe. \n \n Actual numbers are hard to come by when it comes to the mortgage market, but a new analysis from Bank of America was released today that hold some insight:\n \n http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-070622mortgage-woes-story,0,2775823.story?coll=chi-bizfront-hed\n \n \nHomeowners with about $515 billion on adjustable-rate home loans will pay more this year, and another $680 billion worth of mortgages will reset next year, analysts led by Robert Lacoursiere wrote in a research note today. More than 70 percent of the total was granted to subprime borrowers, people with the riskiest credit records, they said.\n\n \n I think that the bolded part demands some explanation. There seems to be a misconception that the sub prime market is dominated by poor people who overreached. This is simply not true. The truth fo the matter is that the subprime market is dominated by second mortgages and home equity loans. When they talk about \"the riskiest credit records\" they do not necessarily mean late payments or low income. While late payments are certainly an indicator of a risky credit rocord, nobody loans hundreds of thousands of dollars to somebody with a strong history of delenquencies. Typically what they are talking about in that context is a high debt to earnings ratio. \n \n \nThe proportion of income that U.S. households with mortgages used for making payments in the first quarter of 2007 was close to or above the previous high in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the analysts said. U.S. mortgage borrowers will continue to find it harder to pay their debts until the end of next year, the analysts said.\n\n \n It is interesting that the author tried to blunt the impact of the report by quoting Ken Lewis, who made his statements before the report was released. \n \n Lewis is incorrect in his assesment in any event since the American worker is loosing ground when it comes to pay...by nearly 6% this year. It does not matter in this situation whether jobs are being created or not if the pay that goes with those jobs is lower. Somehow I doubt that getting a nice new jb that pays less than the job you had whne you got your mortgage is going to help you much when it comes to an increase in your mortgage payment.",

   "I've been watching the whole subprime debacle with amazement for a while now.\n This quote from a newsletter that I get sums it up nicely:\n \n Watching this subprime meltdown is like sitting by the side of a major highway in a fog bank, catching glimpses of semis and minivans plow into one another. We can't really see what's going on except for the occasional smack down right in front of us, but the noise sure is deafening.\n \n I just think it's utterly bizarre that Bear Stearns decided to open up 2 new subprime hedge funds at a time when it was already known that the housing bubble was popping and that the subprime market was going to be its first victim.\n I guess greed and stupidity are everywhere, even (or should that be \"especially\") in the upper echelons of the financial world.\n \n And after having to bail out the first hedge fund for $3.2 billion, it looks like BS will have to bail out the second one as well:\n \n http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/25/markets/bc.bearstearns.hedgefund.reut/index.htm?postversion=2007062518\n \n Although why should BS have to do this anyway? With any investment there's always a certain risk involved. Investors should know this and should not be bailed out because they were stupid and greedy. I don't see casino's bail out losers at the poker table.\n \n For now I'm just sitting on my couch with a bucket of popcorn and am watching the spectacle like a good horror movie. :p",

   "Your fog analogy is an excellent one. I will probably use that in the future :)\n \n I think that Bear Stearns in bailing out those fund because they (and everybody else) are afraid of the consequences if they allow those CDOs to be auctioned. Eventually, though, somebody is going to blink or be forced to put a bunch up for auction and we are going to see a LOT of mark downs across the industry.\n \n I am with you on this one. Sit back, watch the horror story unwind, laugh at the appropriate points, and be happy that I was not stupid enough to end up with any exposure in this area.",

   "The GDP of the U.S. was 13.21 Trillion in 2006. Our debt to foreign nations became 10 Trillion and our work force was 151 million strong. \n \n Half the GDP was actually spent by labor (us) which averages to 44,000 per worker. Our per capita GDP is not the highest (meaning people in some other countries are getting paid better) but the world wants a piece of this economic pie. 6 Trillion per year is up for grabs. So we thought. \n \n What happens if 30% of the pie is simply raw money being dumped into the market by the Federal Reserve? It basically means people and companies thought they where getting a dollar when they where actually getting .60c. The market was saturated with unsupported loans. There is 2 Trillion dollars floating around and the world is beginning to wonder it the money is real. Now the Federal Reserve is going to band aid the issue by diluting the dollar even more. Releasing more printed money to prop the house of cards. In the short term this might make economic engine sputter some more (with respect to per capita GDP) but at some point someone is going to ask for some money back. \n \n Its not rocket science to see the per capita GDP could have been an illusion at 6 trillion and when the notes actually have to be serviced the false top of the Per capita GDP is going to drop more than 2 trillion due to the sudden loss of raw funds being tossed into the market by the reserve and servicing of funds that will actually be on the path to redemption. The 6 trillion could work out to be under 4. The total GDP could easily drop to 8 trillion. \n \n 2 trillion dollars of funny money was thrown into the economy and if want to equate this to a roller coaster, I'd get ready to hang on. Because we owe some countries a boat load of money and Government uses 'we the peoples' credit for those notes. Money is printed and Bonds are printed, and at some point the recipients might want something for the paper.",

   "The simplest way to look at the issue is to ask you and your neighbors; \"Did you get a 30% pay raise in the last 5 years?\" 5% in first quarter of 2006? Look around for the money.\n \n How does a country increase its GDP and increase its trade deficit at the same time? its a cleaver trick. \n \n Am I saying we are in real trouble? No no...I am saying the American work force is about to take one for the team. We got some bills to pay. Might even get to pay for some bail outs.\n \n Oh and if your S.S. where in the market? We would be bailing you out too.",
