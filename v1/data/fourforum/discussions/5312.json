   "I won't throw my ideas on abortion out there just yet, but I have to ask this question. Should fathers have to pay child support considering a mother could have mitigated the expense by having an abortion?\n \n For example: Jack is 55 and makes 20,000 a year. Jack gets injured by Bob, and can no longer work unless he gets a $1000 operation. Jack's religion or other views preclude getting the operation, so he sues Bob for $200,000, the wages he'll lose over the next ten years. Since Jack could mitigate his losses by having the operation, nost likely all he will be entitled to is $1000.\n \n So- shouldn't child support be limited to the cost of an abortion, under our current pro-abortion laws?",

That's the law. The mother is under no obligation moral or legal to have an abortion. The father should have thought about it before he entered into this relationship. That's the cost of being an adult.",

It's like the old saw, if you don't want to do the time, don't do the crime.
