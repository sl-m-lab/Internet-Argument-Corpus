   "The subj. Recently, Condoleezza Rice had an unscheduled meeting with Lebanon's Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and late-night talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni. As it became known, Israeli army commanders did not expect to face that strong opposition from Hezbollah militants. \n \n From the very beginning, Israeli commanders took success for granted within the limit of 6 days, however, the conflict has been lasting for a fortnight already and there seems no end to it. \n \n So, what is the problem? What takes them so long? It is not divulged by Israeli officials but the conflict is being dragged out owing to reinforcements of Chechen insurgents who arrived to Lebanon from Iraq and Chechnya to assist militants of Hezbollah. Well, Chechens seem to be a lucky gain, as, for instance, an Israeli helicopter was shot down by Chechen insurgents who got wide experience doing this during war against Russian federal troops in Pankisi Gorge, and in Iraq where they were fighting back Americans. \n \n As Israeli commanders came to a conclusion that the conflict now turns into a complicated affair though it promised to be an easy deal, they decided to start using phosphorous missiles and cluster bombs, an internationally banned weapon, to subdue the enemy. Anyway, I don't think this was a very wise decision because it is mainly peaceful populace of Lebanon that sustains injuries from Israeli non-conventional weapons.",
