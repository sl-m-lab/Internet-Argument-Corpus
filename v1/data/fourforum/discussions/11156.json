   "Why should wages be taxed at a higher rate than earnings on investments? Let's start there.\nNo. Let's start with being given evidence that lowering capital gains taxes increases the revenue from capital gains taxes. \n \n The relative rates of capital gains taxes and payroll taxes have nothing to do with the fact that when CGT rate goes down the CGT revenue goes up. Certainly, there are limits beyond which this would not hold, but we are apparently within those limits right now. I do not propose to decrease the rate below 15%. I'm just trying to get someone to explain the logic or lack thereof being displayed in the answers given by Barrack and Hillary.\n \n If you are implying that they wish to raise the CGT so they can lower taxes on wages to make things more favorable to the lowly working man, then deal with the possibility that raising taxes on investments may cause the loss of jobs that would have been created or sustained under the present rate, resulting in fewer people to be charged with payroll taxes, ultimately resulting in even less tax revenue. I understand that this is a quite complicated and somewhat unpredictable thing we're dealing with, especially when the global economy an OPEC control of oil prices are factored in, but if I were shown proof that raising capital gains tax will result in less money being sent to the government, I would certainly try to come up with some justification for raising taxes other than to equalize rates between two completely different types of taxes.\n \n One difference between capital gains and payroll taxes is that the investor's decision whether or not to invest (creat jobs for those who will pay taxes on their wages) is based on his expected return. He can either invest or hold his money. The wage earner generally has no choice whether or not to seek work.\n \n The more jobs there are, the more likely an unemployed person is to land one. The more investments there are, the more jobs there are available.\n \n Besides, if we would adopt the Fair Tax plan, we'd not be having this discussion. Income would not be taxed.",

   "As I understand the issue, it doesn't make a dime of difference. When CGT rises, some investors merely shift over to dividend paying stocks (well they used to). Between the federal and state taxes, there isn't noticeable differences in revenue.\n \n And the argument seems to ignore a variety of seemingly obvious issues.\n \n First of all, the rich really don't care. If you can AFFORD to have hundreds of millions in stocks, paying a minor tax rate isn't going to stop you from selling. Furthermore, many rich don't sell based on tax rates. Many CEOs and CFOs have regular sell off points. Gates sells a couple million shares every 6 months or so and has been doing it for years. Obviously the tax rates have changed subsantially over the past two decades yet it hasn't stopped the formerly richest man on the planet from selling stocks and paying CGT. \n \n Second, estate planning always encourages to give away stocks with large gains, not to sell them. First of all, the person who gives them away gets to take the full value of those stocks against their income. Second, they don't get taxed on their gains. They will ALWAYS have a higher contribution to charity by giving away instead of selling and donating the cash unless at a 0% tax rate. But even then that is questionable as the stocks may rise giving even more to the charity. People will be giving away stocks, not selling them and not being taxed regardless of the tax rates.\n \n Third, the most obvious is that people sell when they believe the stock has gotten to the high and when they need the money. Neither of which has any connection to CGT. Pensions sell out parts of the stocks to pay the pensions of former workers. They sell when they have to pay. CGT plays little to no role at all in such decisions. No rational person is going to not sell their stock just because they think CGT is high if they believe a stock drop is going happen. \n \n The argument Isly gives sounds exactly like supply side economics. \n \n Which we know doesn't work. \n \n \n\n Lowering taxes on capital gains does encourage people to invest. It is from these investments that the wage earners prosper. More investments means more jobs (to tax). More investments means more capital gains (to tax). In order to keep investments high, we need to keep taxes on investments low.\n\n \n Not at all. An excellent example is what is forcing business out of the US: high labor costs. Not high taxes. In fact moderate taxes are a great thing. Unlike other countries, the US has a socialized system where business and people pay taxes which are used to put in capital improvements and maintain them such as roads, electrical lines, sewage, bridges, etc. Without these, a business has a hard time operating. By paying taxes, each business benefits at a fraction of the cost. One of the biggest problems that MNCs encounter overseas is the lack of such programs. They have to pony up millions in capital improvements. It's one of the reasons why they'd rather throw technology at a problem here then move overseas to get cheap labor. It is CHEAPER to pay taxes and throw technology at it then put in all of the capital improvements themselves. \n \n And people invest where they believe value is, not because of taxes. Just because you see low taxes doesn't equate to you investing. There has to be an opportunity, a way to create value. Even in the Nordic States who have obscene marginal taxes there is large investment because inventors believe there are opportunities. What moderate taxes may do is create disincentives for half baked ideas. In a low tax system, one may feel that the risk for investing in what may be half baked idea is acceptable. That's poor allocation of resources. \n \n More investments doesn't mean more jobs. In fact more investment in the US has led to fewer jobs particularly in the manufacturing sector. By automating processes, you can eliminate jobs (compare Ford's workforce per car 50 years ago to now, quite a massive differential). What people fail to understand is that it is technology that is destroying the large number of manufacturing jobs, not trade.",

It might help you understand my POV if you'd read it word for word.\n \n CGT cuts actually make the rich pay more in taxes.\n \n http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=1101\n \n The ABCs of the Capital Gains Tax\n by Stephen Moore and John Silvia \n October 4, 1995\n \n This study examines the historical experience with the capital gains tax in the United States, as well as the findings of more than 50 economic studies on capital gains taxation. We conclude that a capital gains tax cut would \n \n substantially raise tax collections and increase tax payments by the rich;\n \n \n increase the rate of capital formation, economic growth, and job creation through the year 2000;\n \n \n unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of unrealized capital gains, thus promoting more efficient allocation of capital;\n \n \n expand economic opportunities for the most economically disadvantaged workers by bringing jobs and new businesses to capital-starved areas, such as America's inner cities.\n \n Finally, the study argues that the capital gains tax is so economically inefficient--because of its punitive effect on entrepreneurship, thrift, and investment--that the optimal economic policy for the United States would be to abolish the tax entirely. \n \n You're looking at a poor man who thinks the capital gains tax [cut] is the best thing that could happen to this country, because that's when the work will come back. People say capital gains are for the rich, but I've never been hired by a poor man.\n \n -- New Jersey painting contractor\n \n \n \n Over the past 10 years perhaps no single economic issue has been embroiled in more controversy than the capital gains tax. Ever since the capital gains tax rate was raised from 20 to 28 percent as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, Republicans and many centrist Democrats have tried repeatedly to enact a capital gains tax cut to stimulate job creation and economic growth. Those efforts have been stymied on each occasion by the criticism that the tax cut would be a \"giveaway to the rich.\" \n \n (Man, does that ever sound familiar?)^^^^\n \n Over the past 10 years perhaps no single economic issue has been embroiled in more controversy than the capital gains tax. Ever since the capital gains tax rate was raised from 20 to 28 percent as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, Republicans and many centrist Democrats have tried repeatedly to enact a capital gains tax cut to stimulate job creation and economic growth. Those efforts have been stymied on each occasion by the criticism that the tax cut would be a \"giveaway to the rich.\" \n \n This year the political logjam may finally be broken. A capital gains tax cut is a central feature of the Republican budget plan, which is now making its way through Congress. Earlier this year Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich called tax cuts the \"crown jewel\" of the GOP Contract with America. Yet, as the prospects for passage grow more promising, the opposition is once again mobilizing for what appears to be an eleventh-hour campaign to defeat the measure. And no one knows whether President Clinton would sign a capital gains tax cut even if Congress were to pass one.\n \n Despite the high profile of this tax issue in Washington, many Americans still have little awareness of why the tax treatment of capital gains should matter to them. This study is an attempt to make the capital gains tax understandable and relevant to ordinary American workers. We intend to walk the reader through the ABCs of the capital gains tax. Here are some of the questions this study addresses: \n \n What is capital?\n \n \n What is a capital gain?\n \n \n Why is the capital gains tax important to the U.S. economy?\n \n \n How does the capital gains tax affect the typical American worker?\n \n \n Who pays the capital gains tax? Is it a rich man's tax?\n \n \n Would a capital gains tax cut increase the budget deficit?\n \n \n How does the U.S. capital gains tax compare with those of other nations?\n \n \n How would a capital gains tax cut affect jobs and wages?\n \n To answer those questions, this guide synthesizes all of the most recent and well-respected studies of the issue and presents the arguments for and against the proposed tax cut. It is our conclusion from reviewing the historical evidence and more than 50 studies that the GOP tax reduction plan (which would lower the tax rate from 28 to 19.6 percent and index gains for inflation) would \n \n increase taxes collected from the rich;\n \n \n increase the rates of capital formation, economic growth, job creation, and real wages over the next decade; and\n \n \n unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of unrealized capital gains, thus promoting a more efficient capital market. \n \n \n \n An even more economically compelling reform would be to eliminate the capital gains tax entirely. Abolishing the capital gains tax would promote entrepreneurship, business creation, U.S. competitiveness, and higher wages for American workers--especially for the most economically disadvantaged among us.",

   "Supply side economics is for those who believe in Voodoo. \n \n Good job isly ilwott on failing to address much of anything that Steeeve or I wrote.\n \n Cato makes a series of questionable assumptions\n \n 1) They assume that people will change their buying and selling behavior based on taxes, not on need or beliefs about the market. As I already discussed that, such an assumption doesn't make sense. Especially when some of the larges share holders are pension funds and rich individuals, both of which have far greater concerns and make decisions based on need, long term planning and estate planning (well not pensions but the rich). Very little of that actually deals with CGT rates. \n \n Explain to me why a sane, rational investor would sell out due to tax rates and not a belief on where the market is going. Or are you going to behave as your normally do in economics debates? \n \n 2) Cato's point on lowering CGT to bring investment to the rust belt and inner cities is completely idiotic. It doesn't even make sense. There isn't investment there because there are little opportunities and weak education. How would lowering CGT in any way effect the reason for why there isn't investment in the first place? \n \n 3)\n \nFinally, the study argues that the capital gains tax is so economically inefficient--because of its punitive effect on entrepreneurship, thrift, and investment--that the optimal economic policy for the United States would be to abolish the tax entirely.\n\n \n HUH?

Furthermore, how does CGT affect it when the people it would be taxing aren't even related to entrepreneurship?\n \n That makes no sense. How does it hurt thrift? In fact doesn't it aid thrift? By creating incentives to hold on to stocks to get the long term capital gains, it prevents people from blowing cash on short term, as well as potentially losing large amounts from small shifts in the market.

We're seeing the potential for this now.\n \n You're going to do a lot better then Cato who doesn't provide good reasons for why their arguments make sense.\n \n If you are just going to spam and resort to the gish gallop, there's no point in discussing things with you.",

   "[QUOTE=CUNxTime;309002]\n\n \n Wait a sec. If someone is deciding where to invest money, a 5% decrease in profits can be huge. Certainly 5% could convince someone to invest elsewhere that has a better tax policy.\n\n \n You are missing a couple of important points here. First, if you think that CGTs are bad, you should see foreign investment taxes and keep in mind that in most cases you pay taxes twice on foreign investments (once wherever you have invested and once when you bring the money back into the US). From a practical standpoint we can completely ignore the idea of capital flight unless CGTs reach a level that is higher than combined foreign investment taxes and CGTs in other countries, so as long as we keep it below say 40-50%, capital flight is pretty much off the table.\n \n So, where does that leave us? Mostly it leaves us with a question of directed investment. Most CGTs are realized from equity investments (stock market). This is not necessarily a bad thing since from an economic standpoint (macro) equity investments are about worthless. The only time money in the stock market actually spurs development or does any real good at all is in a direct offering from a company (such as an IPO). So, lets say that CGTs actually DO change investor behavior. Since capital flight is off the table, and they are running from equities because of an added 5% tax on their profits, where does that leave them? The short answer is either venture capital or bonds. BOTH of those, though, are about 20x better than stocks when it comes to actual economic benefit to the economy as a whole, so we win either way.",

The important thing is that the money gets spent, not necessarily who spends it. If anything, it MAY be better (to an extent) for the government to spend the money since most .gov spending programs are specifically designed to spur the economy (i.e \"buy American\" and small business inclusion requirements). \n \n I agree with you, steeeve, people blow the whole tax thing way out of proportion. I think that is because politicians feel like it is something they can connect with the voters on, so they flog the hell out of it even though they know that to joe and jane middle class it is mostly a non issue. \n \n Personally, I am advocating a 15% increase in income taxes across the board coupled with a freeze in federal spending at the current level.

   "Supply side economics is for those who believe in Voodoo. \nThis is your opinion.\n \n \n\n Good job isly ilwott on failing to address much of anything that Steeeve or I wrote.\nI may neglect to respond to you in the future. You've proved your MO to me already. I will likely respond to Steeeeve because he appears to be more polite and not belligerent as are you. I have had quite enough of your obvious childishness from other threads.\n \n \n \n\n Cato makes a series of questionable assumptions\nIf you are referring to the text in the link I posted, please quote from it. Do not assume that I should go back and try to find their assumptions based on your paraphrasals.\n \n \n \n\n 1) They assume that people will change their buying and selling behavior based on taxes, not on need or beliefs about the market. As I already discussed that, such an assumption doesn't make sense. \nQuote the CATO article.\n \n \n \nEspecially when some of the largest share holders are pension funds and rich individuals, both of which have far greater concerns and make decisions based on need, long term planning and estate planning (well not pensions but the rich). Very little of that actually deals with CGT rates. \nDo you have valid numbers that differentiate receipts from pension funds and rich individuals as opposed to the rest of the world. Additionally, by speaking of shareholders, you are limiting this to the stock market. CGT applies to many things.\n \n \n \n\n Explain to me why a sane, rational investor would sell out due to tax rates and not a belief on where the market is going.\nI do not claim to have said they would. Can you show me where I did?\n \n What I do consider plausible is that a sane, rational investor is more likely to INVEST (buy into) (release some money into the economy for the backing of another company or a personal business) if the CGT is lower. I would think that his probability of investing is inversely proportional to the CGT rate.\n \n \n \n\n Or are you going to behave as your normally do in economics debates? \nThis is a prime example of your childish taunting. Does your mother know that you've stopped beating your wife?\n \n \n \n\n 2) Cato's point on lowering CGT to bring investment to the rust belt and inner cities is completely idiotic. It doesn't even make sense. There isn't investment there because there are little opportunities and weak education. How would lowering CGT in any way effect the reason for why there isn't investment in the first place?\nThat is your opinion. As has been stated, the complexity of this issue varies from locale to locale. Big companies choose their locations based on many things...labor pools, transportation costs, local taxes, incentives from hungry local goverments and interconnected businesses that may prosper with the new kid on the block.\n \n Inner cities are not likely to see anymore auto manufacturer's build or expand within their confines. These companies are moving to Mexico and rural areas of the US. Mercedes plant here is between cities. Kia is building one in a small town area.\n \n Realizing investments in inner cities may take more than tax incentives.\n \n \n \n \n\n 3)\n \n \n HUH? How does CGT hurt entrepreneurship? How does CGT effect my neighbor's business? Oh wait, it doesn't. Furthermore, how does CGT affect it when the people it would be taxing aren't even related to entrepreneurship?\n \n That makes no sense. How does it hurt thrift? In fact doesn't it aid thrift? By creating incentives to hold on to stocks to get the long term capital gains, it prevents people from blowing cash on short term, as well as potentially losing large amounts from small shifts in the market. As for investment, Cato is ignoring the reasons for investment. Taxes are generally one of the last things one thinks about before investing barring Ceteris paribus. \nHere's what they said again...since quotes of quotes in quotes don't show in your text:\n \n \nFinally, the study argues that the capital gains tax is so economically inefficient--because of its punitive effect on entrepreneurship, thrift, and investment--that the optimal economic policy for the United States would be to abolish the tax entirely. \nI suppose the entrepreneurship refers to small business owners who may not expand or decide to close shop because of taxes. I suppose it could have a punitive effect on thrift as it relates to entrepreneurs and big businesses alike having to deny raises therefore causing working to spend all their money to survive, leaving nothing to for them to save. Your statement about taxes not affecting decisions to invest is laughable.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n 4) \n \n That could be argued for all taxes. But supply economics is real questionable, especially as it ignores differences in savings/spending multipliers across classes. A rising tide doesn't lift all boats. Just the last recession showed that. As the rich got their tax cuts the economy did slowly get better but the middle and poor still got screwed. Jobs didn't rebound. We're seeing the potential for this now.\n...and this ^^^^ is in reference to:\n \n \nYou're looking at a poor man who thinks the capital gains tax [cut] is the best thing that could happen to this country, because that's when the work will come back. People say capital gains are for the rich, but I've never been hired by a poor man.\n \n -- New Jersey painting contractor \nI do not understand why you say \"That could be argued for all taxes.\" Is it that when taxes are lowered the work comes back? Is it that any tax cut is the best thing that could happen to this country? Is it that people say capital gains are for the rich? Is it that it is true that nobody has ever been hired by a poor man? Just what do you mean?\n \n \n \n\n You're going to do a lot better then Cato who doesn't provide good reasons for why their arguments make sense.\nThank you for the confidence in my future.\n \n \n \n\n If you are just going to spam and resort to the gish gallop, there's no point in discussing things with you.\nYou are apparently unfamiliar with the definition of spam. I am unfamiliar with gish gallop.\n \n That there's no point in discussing things with you is becoming obvious thread by thread.\n \n \n \n **********************************************************\n \n \n \nInvestments carry a risk of losing 100% (or more) of your investment. If someone RISKS their capital, they deserve to make money on it, otherwise, why would they do so and if they don't our economy suffers. It's funny how many people would rather see the whole country suffer, just to 'get even' with 'the rich'. When capital is doing well, EVERYONE, is better off!\nBut it's not fair! We should all be given what we need by the government, thereby equalizing the benefits of hard work and risk. We should take from those who have earned excess profits and give to those who are too lazy to do anything besides go the polls and re-elect us...and these poor people should be given all the food they need so they don't have to be burdened with a job.;) \n \n \nAnyone can go to a politically charged website and post their arguments. I want you to actually study the issue and make your own argument the way I did in my previous post you failed to address.\nI doubt the CBO is any less politically charged than CATO. I am studying the issue. I'm starting from the question asked by what's his face to the Democratic candidates. ABC news is apparently convinced that it is a logical question to ask that if you know the revenue is going to go down when you increase the tax and that the revenue is going to go up if you decrease the tax, are you still planning to increase the tax. Both said yes.\n \n Whether CATO is right or the CBO is right, ABC apparently is convinced that it was a legitimate question and I deduced from that that the premise must have some validity.\n \n \n \n \n I am an accountant and have studied tax (although I'm an auditor) which doesn't make me right but does show that I have not only studied the position of CATO Institute (a highly biased organization towards libertarian/republican viewpoints) but those on the left and mainly those by unbiased sources such as the GAO and CBO. \nCongratulations on being an accountant. I am not an accountant. I have not studied tax. I understand that understanding the entire US tax code would require the reading of about 9 million words...or was it 9 million pages?\n \n And what makes you think the GAO and CBO cannot be biased? I have recollections of committee reports being biased to conform to the beliefs a the committee chairman many times. The CBO is not exempt from partisanship. \n \n \n \n\n When you choose to actually read and respond in your own words then I'd be happy to respond. Posting a biased article doesn't help your point if it is was true (which it isn't). \nI am reading what you link to and most of what you say on your own. That does not mean I will roll over and play dead everytime you post something that you believe irrefutable. I know that some of what you say is opinion. I want to see factual numbers that dispute the claims made by the ABC questioners that tax revenue from CGT varies inversely as the rate changes.\n \n \n \n\n I already said I agree in a low CGT but I don't agree for the reasons you state.\nWhy do you agree with a low CGT? What should the rate be?\n \n Do you have some knowledge of what the perfect rate is? Should it be zero? Should it be 28%? What should it be...and why?",

   "Because there is actually no evidence at all that changing the CGT rate modifies investor behavior, nor is there any indication AT ALL that the Bush cuts, or previous cuts, were responsible for the increased revenue cited.\n \n This is almost as laughable as the idea that a relatively minor (say 5%) tax increase or decrease is likely to have a significant effect on consumer behavior. Most Americans do not pay enough in taxes for a 5% change to make any real difference at all. \nI don't remember their claim being tied to investor behavior. It was tied to tax revenue. They said that when the CGT goes down, revenue from it goes up. They said that when the CGT goes up, revenue from it goes down. They did not address investor behavior directly.\n \n \n \n \n\n This is a FAR more complex subject than your post, or apparently the debate question (assuming you have correctly represented it here) presents. \nI am aware of the complexity of the whole scene. I do not think I have misrepresented the question put at the debate. You may google a transcript to check me. \n \n \n \n\n Back in the real world, the claim that decreasing ANY taxes increases revenue or provides significant economic stimulus is questionable at best. The problem is that we have never seen tax breaks like that with a corresponding decrease in federal spending. Instead we have always seen tax cuts coupled with increased deficit spending, which not only do we know provides economic stimulus, but leads to increased revenue at the government level. This is such a well understood phenomenon that the stimulus is actually calculable.\nWe're not discussing the entire economy and government spending. We're talking about the CGT rate and the CGT revenue. Obviously, we need to cut spending. Just where we need to cut is up for debate. On occasion, government spending can be a stimulant, depending on where the government spends the money. Some of it gets recycled back into the economy. Some of it goes into other countries' economies.",

Furthermore, they argue that raising tax rates will decrease such activity. That is idiotic regarding low to medium levels of taxation, even high regarding rational stock behavior. Tax rates will not change your behavior on selling a stock if you think the market is going to tank or if you need the money. The only caveat to that is if you know that doing so will push you into the next tax bracket. But it is easy to find deductions to reduce such gains. \n \n \nWhat I do consider plausible is that a sane, rational investor is more likely to INVEST (buy into) (release some money into the economy for the backing of another company or a personal business) if the CGT is lower.\n\n \n Why? Why would CGT matter compared to actual opportunities for value creation? That doesn't make much sense. People invest because they think there is value and an opportunity for wealth creation. Merely because CGT is low doesn't mean they will invest. Right now CGT is lower then decades past and you don't see much investment.

Does your mother know that you've stopped beating your wife?\n\n \n You've ran from virtually every economics thread, especially when it got difficult and required a brain. Why should I think you have the stamina to run this one? Past performance predicts future performance. And your evaluation is not looking good. \n \n \nThat is your opinion. As has been stated, the complexity of this issue varies from locale to locale. Big companies choose their locations based on many things...labor pools, transportation costs, local taxes, incentives from hungry local goverments and interconnected businesses that may prosper with the new kid on the block.\n\n \n Good job for saying the same thing I did. The locale that Cato is talking about doesn't have incentives for firms to create value. Thus they don't invest. It's actually quite simple. Ceteris paribus, taxes matter. But Ceteris paribus rarely applies. In fact one of the few times you seem Ceteris paribus is when cities and counties are fighting tax incentive battles directly targeting specific firm proposals with each other. Other then that, not a issue. Inner cities don't have the environment and factors that promote wealth creation. Lowering CGT won't even start to solve those problems.\n \n \nInner cities are not likely to see anymore auto manufacturer's build or expand within their confines. These companies are moving to Mexico and rural areas of the US. Mercedes plant here is between cities. Kia is building one in a small town area.\n \n Realizing investments in inner cities may take more than tax incentives.\n\n \n Obviously. Realizing investments in inner cities requires that those inner cities change their education levels, possibly zoning, capital improvements, and population makeups. Taxes are really one of the last things. In fact, in Roseburg Oregon who was fighting for a Dell call center has everything except the tax structure that Dell wanted. Firms invest because of factors independent of taxes. \n \n \nHere's what they said again...since quotes of quotes in quotes don't show in your text:\n\n \n And that quote still doesn't make any sense the second time around. \n \n \nI suppose the entrepreneurship refers to small business owners who may not expand or decide to close shop because of taxes.\n\n \n Capital gains tax is different then the taxes that small business owners face. You're now changing the subject away from CGT to taxes in general. Make up your mind which you want to talk about. In fact your statement about other taxes seems to suggest that Cato's entrepreneurship claim is bull. \n \n \nYour statement about taxes not affecting decisions to invest is laughable.\n\n \n Where did I say they don't affect decisions?\n \n Hello did you fail to notice this?\n \n \"Taxes are generally one of the last things one thinks about before investing barring Ceteris paribus.\" \n \n Btw, Ceteris paribus is Latin for \"all else equal.\"\n \n \nI do not understand why you say \"That could be argued for all taxes.\" Is it that when taxes are lowered the work comes back? Is it that any tax cut is the best thing that could happen to this country? Is it that people say capital gains are for the rich? Is it that it is true that nobody has ever been hired by a poor man? Just what do you mean?\n\n \n *sigh* \n \n I suppose I should have expected this. The argument given by Cato is one against all taxes. By reducing the amount taken away from consumers, you reduce the amount they can spend. By increasing the amount they can spend via tax reduction, you can stimulate the economy. On some level this is invariably true, but to argue that lowering CGT will direct cause this to happen ignores the same problems as all tax cuts have: they don't account for the different spending/savings factors of different classes. Each class spends and saves money different then the next. When you cut taxes and thus increase their discretionary spending, each class will save some spend some. Generally the poor spend it all on basics because well they are poor. The middle class is increasingly blowing it all on basics as well. The rich though...that's the real question. And there's not much conclusive data on their spending/savings factors. But I hard time believing that just because Gates and other rich get a tax cut that they go out and blow it. My parents are rich in their retirement and they didn't spend much of anything from the past tax cuts and rebates. \n \n I actually had a discussion with my brother about how to increase spending through tax cuts. Send everyone who gets a stimulus a voucher for X dollars that can only be redeemed at banks for $20 bills and can't be deposited that day. That will increase spending. Imagine if you had $600 in your pocket in $20s that you couldn't deposit at your bank. I don't care what class you are, that will push you spend unlike how we previous having been doing it....but that's neither here nor there. \n \n \nYou are apparently unfamiliar with the definition of spam. I am unfamiliar with gish gallop.\n\n \n Not at all. You posted several of the same arguments with no replies to rebuttals. That's spamming. And you are creating several different arguments at the same time instead of focusing on one. That's beginning to look a lot like the gish gallop.\n \n \nThat there's no point in discussing things with you is becoming obvious thread by thread.\n\n \n Translation: I don't like you and how you refute my craptastic arguments. Therefore I won't respond because I don't like being proven wrong. \n \n You don't seem to quite understand why people invest. \n \n Does the term 'value creation' mean anything to you?\n How about 'future cash flows?'",

But the 45 percent increase in realizations in 1996--before the cut--exceeded the 40 percent and 25 percent increases in 1997 and 1998 that followed it.

The only caveat to that is if you know that doing so will push you into the next tax bracket. But it is easy to find deductions to reduce such gains. \n \n \n \n Why? Why would CGT matter compared to actual opportunities for value creation? That doesn't make much sense. People invest because they think there is value and an opportunity for wealth creation. Merely because CGT is low doesn't mean they will invest. Right now CGT is lower then decades past and you don't see much investment. Your argument ignores the primary reason for investment in the first place. It's not about taxes. It's about value creation. \n \n \n \n Possibly in theory, holding all things equal. But when does that actually happen? When in history has the opportunities for value creation been exactly the same? Your argument is simplistic as it ignores factors that actually matter. \n \n \n \n You've ran from virtually every economics thread, especially when it got difficult and required a brain. Why should I think you have the stamina to run this one? Past performance predicts future performance. And your evaluation is not looking good. \n \n \n \n Good job for saying the same thing I did. The locale that Cato is talking about doesn't have incentives for firms to create value. Thus they don't invest. It's actually quite simple. Ceteris paribus, taxes matter. But Ceteris paribus rarely applies. In fact one of the few times you seem Ceteris paribus is when cities and counties are fighting tax incentive battles directly targeting specific firm proposals with each other. Other then that, not a issue. Inner cities don't have the environment and factors that promote wealth creation. Lowering CGT won't even start to solve those problems.\n \n \n \n Obviously. Realizing investments in inner cities requires that those inner cities change their education levels, possibly zoning, capital improvements, and population makeups. Taxes are really one of the last things. In fact, in Roseburg Oregon who was fighting for a Dell call center has everything except the tax structure that Dell wanted. Firms invest because of factors independent of taxes. \n \n \n \n And that quote still doesn't make any sense the second time around. \n \n \n \n Capital gains tax is different then the taxes that small business owners face. You're now changing the subject away from CGT to taxes in general. Make up your mind which you want to talk about. In fact your statement about other taxes seems to suggest that Cato's entrepreneurship claim is bull. \n \n \n \n Where did I say they don't affect decisions?\n \n Hello did you fail to notice this?\n \n \"Taxes are generally one of the last things one thinks about before investing barring Ceteris paribus.\" \n \n Btw, Ceteris paribus is Latin for \"all else equal.\"\n \n \n \n *sigh* \n \n I suppose I should have expected this. The argument given by Cato is one against all taxes. By reducing the amount taken away from consumers, you reduce the amount they can spend. By increasing the amount they can spend via tax reduction, you can stimulate the economy. On some level this is invariably true, but to argue that lowering CGT will direct cause this to happen ignores the same problems as all tax cuts have: they don't account for the different spending/savings factors of different classes. Each class spends and saves money different then the next. When you cut taxes and thus increase their discretionary spending, each class will save some spend some. Generally the poor spend it all on basics because well they are poor. The middle class is increasingly blowing it all on basics as well. The rich though...that's the real question. And there's not much conclusive data on their spending/savings factors. But I hard time believing that just because Gates and other rich get a tax cut that they go out and blow it. My parents are rich in their retirement and they didn't spend much of anything from the past tax cuts and rebates. \n \n I actually had a discussion with my brother about how to increase spending through tax cuts. Send everyone who gets a stimulus a voucher for X dollars that can only be redeemed at banks for $20 bills and can't be deposited that day. That will increase spending. Imagine if you had $600 in your pocket in $20s that you couldn't deposit at your bank. I don't care what class you are, that will push you spend unlike how we previous having been doing it....but that's neither here nor there. \n \n \n \n Not at all. You posted several of the same arguments with no replies to rebuttals. That's spamming. And you are creating several different arguments at the same time instead of focusing on one. That's beginning to look a lot like the gish gallop.\n \n \n \n Translation: I don't like you and how you refute my craptastic arguments. Therefore I won't respond because I don't like being proven wrong. \n \n You don't seem to quite understand why people invest. \n \n Does the term 'value creation' mean anything to you?\n How about 'future cash flows?'\n\n This does not surprise me at all. \n \n I will answer a few of your stupid questions from above...just to demonstrate your stupidity and untruthfulness. The bolded text is yours from above.\n \n What do receipts have to do with anything? \n \n Revenue = receipts\n \n You've ran from virtually every economics thread, especially when it got difficult and required a brain. Why should I think you have the stamina to run this one? Past performance predicts future performance. And your evaluation is not looking good. \n \n Show me a link to one economics thread I have \"ran\" from. (So far, I have posted in only one other Economics thread that I can find.) Better yet, show me any thread that I have \"ran\" from.\n \n Otherwise, you will be permanently labeled as a liar. I won't use that silly Liar's Corner that was created just for you. I'll let you provide your evidence (that you didn't lie above) right here in this thread where it belongs.\n \n I believe the only reason you post such untruths is in hopes that readers will take your word for it and assume that I have actually run from you before...on any thread. It is actually you that has done such...when you deleted the entire \"Fallacies\" thread that you started and lost face in.

   "Really? The CATO institute is self admittedly politically charged. The CBO was created for the sole fact of being an unbiased source of information for Congress. The GAO is in the same manner.

You will find the significance is not really there...even more so if you do some indepth analysis on the true rates (they have many provisions back in 80s for exclusion).\n In terms of the GAO, I've talked to them many times but beyond that they are created to be unbiased. They have little to no self serving interests unlike the CATO institute which proudly admits (like any political organization would) it is biased.\n \n The GAO and CBO don't always make committee reports. Congress asks them to provide an answer to a question and they do so accordingly. There is no benefit to the CBO or GAO in making reports lean a certain way. Furthermore, in the link I presented the CBO shows it's analysis (unlike CATO) and reports all sides of the issue (Unlike CATO).\n \n Claiming the CATO institute is just more informed and less biased than the CBO and GAO is really pushing a weak argument in my opinion. \n \n \n It is right there in the CBO link I sent you. I just did an extremely rough correlation in Excel and the numbers came out to ~.3 to ~.4 depending on what you use...and that is being very generous towards your cause. This indicates that there is no strong evidence of correlation. \n \n (method using correlation feature in excel). \n \n ABC's Gibson is wrong and this obviously wouldn't be the first time a news reporter is wrong.

Can any group of people be totally unbiased? Do you really think there's a truly unbiased person alive?\n \n The CATO article was simply the first I found saying that taxes going up often causes revenues to go down and vice versa.

Notice he said 100 million people in this country own stock, which I assume is true. But the vast majority of those people only own stock through retirement plans like IRAs and 401Ks. They might own stock through these investments, but even when they withdraw money from them, they do not pay capital gains tax. The only tax that might be placed on withdrawals are an ordinary income tax. They never pay a capital gains tax, so increasing it will never affect people with these retirement accounts.\n \n A capital gains tax is for taxing the profit from the sale of an investment like stocks. But only a very small percentage of Americans--the elite--have these kind of investments outside of retirement accounts. Yet Gibson said the 100 million people who own stock would be affected by an increase in the capital gains tax.\n \n Gibson is playing a shell game with the American public, deliberately confusing stock-owning people with capital gains tax-paying people.

A- if capital is doing well (i.e. the stock market or whatever) then many people, not just million and billionaires are doing better. Also, when the economy is cranking, there are more businesses starting and people are making more money (and therefore spending more money) so there are more jobs to be had.\n \n \nIf go getting even you mean \"fair\" then i'm all for that too. I thought by \"getting even' you meant revenge.\n\n \n What I'm saying is that Obama says he'd raise the Cap Gains tax even if it would hurt the country in general since it would be more fair must mean that he's only doing it to 'punish' the 'rich'. Taking money from one person doesn't equate to someone else doing better and he'd hurt everyone, as long as the 'rich' are hurt more. That's what I mean by getting even.\n \n And really, how is sapping people who've worked hard and smart really 'fair' anyway? All the people who think that the people who are doing well should be punished, IMO, are wrong. Furthermore, its the producers who drive this county's economy in the first place.",

   "I beg to differ on two points. First, a huge amount of Americans are invested in the market (401Ks and mutual funds etc...) so when capital is doing well, most people are better off (and this isn't taking in to account the job creation and other aspects).\n Now, for the 'Getting Even' part. Obama himself said that he'd raise the Cap Gains tax, even if it meant lowering the govt's take since it would be more 'fair' to raise the tax (i.e. the even if it hurt the govt, he'd raise the tax to get even with the rich, that sounds pretty straight forward to me.)\nDitto.\n \n \nAnd yet during the recent boom the average income for the middle class has actually FALLEN in real dollars, which would seem to imply that your premise here is incorrect.\n \n AS far as Obamas statement, that is NOT what he said. He said he would raise CGTs because he felt it would be more fair. The only way to imagine that he is saying he would do so even if it would cut revenue is to assume that he agreed with the statement that cutting CGTs will increase revenue. As has already been pointed out, that is a faulty premise.\nIt has not been proven a faulty premise yet. It is a matter of differing opinions regarding something that has been claimed regarding alleged causality between tax rates and revenues (from that tax) with the resulting differences being caused by multiple interpretations of numbers, formulas and causality.\n \n \nThe strange thing is that the CBOs ERTA predictions turned out to be DEAD ON in the end. During the Reagan years the ERTA estimates were off because when they did them the massive deficit spending had not been factored in (in fact it had not been passed). AS the Reagan years drew to a close and spending slowed revenues came back into the ETRA estimate range, which is why when Bush Sr tried to inject some fiscal sanity back into the government and pushed down deficit spending he was forced to raise taxes.\n...and GWB's major mistake has been the rampant spending which has exceeded the increase in revenue that he got from the tax reductions. Had he cut spending as his daddy did, we'd be in much better shape, I think. (Now that is just an opinion piece.)\n \n \n \n\n The ERTA estimates are actually one of the primary reasons that we we pretty much dismiss reaganomics for the economic voodoo that it was. The ERTA was based on certain assumptions about spending levels and deficit levels (assumptions that they were told to use). These are not complex calculations we are talking about here. If you take their original numbers (which everybody pretty much agrees are GOOD based on the criteria they used) and then add in the deficit spending that was actually done, in the end you wind up with numbers that mirror what actually ended up happening. This pretty much proves that it was the deficit spending, NOT the tax cuts, that gave us those economic results. \nNow you are injecting the real cause of confusion regarding the original premise of the question. A gain in revenue was wiped away by deficit spending. That does not mean that the gain in revenue (from the CGT reduction) did not happen.\n \n What should happen is that we leave the CGT where it is and reduce spending drastically by way of several steps:\n \n 1\n Cut the size of the government work force. (Not by gutting the military, but by reducing the staff of every over-stuffed government office, including staff for our representatives.)\n \n 2\n Cut government perks for elected and appointed officials.\n \n 3\n Cut earmark spending and grants for projects that do not improve our lot.\n \n \n \n\n Or you could read and then post your own argument. The problem with the posting style that you have been using is mostly that you spam us with these huge C&P posts that cover a LOT of ground, leaving a situation where to debate you basically requires a lot of time and effort and much of that time and effort is spent refuting points that are no longer particularly relevant. The model you are advancing here has essentially been declared DOA in the last several years. There are very few economists out there who will still actually support Reaganomics or the bastardization of the supply side model/laffer curve that he tried to use. \nSince you seem to know that there are very few economists who will...can you name them for me? How many is very few? How many economsts are there? I think this is a blow-smoke statement. Your's trying to blow smoke up my dress.\n \n Your understanding of \"spam\" is as errant as OC's.\n \n \n \n\n Maybe if you would highlight the section of whatever C&P you are posting so attention is drawn to the portion that you particularly want to discuss/defend it would be helpful.\nMaybe if you would look at the above quote of me that you made, you will see that is precisely what I did.\n \n I pasted an entire short article earlier so you wouldn't actually have to go to it. I intended for you to read the whole thing. That's why it was introduced as it was. I thought the pasting was a rather nice thing to do in this case.\n \n I had been posting my own words before that and I did not see that anyone else did anything besides show the links and keep jabbering without highlighting salient parts of the link, thus expecting me to read the whole thing and find what they wanted to me to glean from it. \n \n \n \n\n What may be even easier is if we just skipped opinion pieces like the above all together and just talked numbers and straight economics.\nIn this case as in many others, if we skip all the opinion pieces, we'll just have to stop posting. All I've seen so far are opinions regarding causality.\n \n \nDammit, I was saving that :)\n \n BAck in the real world, it is pretty rare that the JEC agrees on anything. It is pretty much a joke. Not only is the CBO non partisan, they are required to issue a \"report card\" showing how often their projections turn out to be correct. \n \n Since bhbcu64 already ruined my trap :) I will also point out that the paper in question was written specifically to protest the clinton capital gains tax increase, which passed and did not have any of the dire consequences that the JEC report predicted.\nDoes that prove that Clinton's raising of the taxes did not decrease the revenue from it? No. Clinton's gutting of the military made up for the loss of revenue he got from increasing the tax. So here comes the \"all things being equal\" equalizer.\n \n Clinton disguised the causality by cutting spending, Little Bush disguised it with overspending.\n \n \nAs so many have already pointed out...A biased group claiming bias of an organization who has consistently been unbiased is laughable. \n \n I don't want to insult but you are grasping at straws to claim the CBO is biased. They and the GAO are more often than not dead on with their projections and predictions and have done so for many years. I don't even understand how one could say the \"democrat controlled CBO\". The democrats can't appoint employees. They only (along with a few others) appoint the director who really doesn't have much power anyway. The GAO is even less likely to be biased. \nPerhaps they are less biased. I think all groups that interpret causality are biased.\n \n The CBO is full of people. I would likely be safe in supposing that each of those people belongs to or supports one party or another. Just as we worry about religious beliefs being interjected into government activities, we should not dismiss the idea that party politics might be interjected into supposed non-biased organizations.\n \n I will concede that CBO is likely less biased than my linked sources...but not that their conclusions regarding the inverse relationship of rates to revenue are correct.\n \n \n \n\n If you find the inverse then perhaps that speaks to just how unbiased they really are. They can't be both biased for the right and left. Furthermore, is your argument really that the CATO institute is right because the CBO is biased? Surely you can see how that is going to come across a little crazy to some.\nCertainly not. I agree that CATO is biased. I agree that JEC is baised (which way depending on who's in control), I believe any large group of people that determine what should be the accepted interpretations of complicated ambiguous information will be biased to a degree. I believe there are no unbiased decision making groups operating in the United States Federal Government.\n \n \n \n\n You are acting like a 5 year old as well. Either stop or don't bother waiting for me to respond to you.\nNo. I was responding to an apparent 5 year old brain in the only way he could understand.",

Where do you think their wages come from? It's the producers that provide the jobs that enable the workers to get paid so the can SPEND THEIR MONEY on things over and above what they really need. That's what drives today's economy. High investments make it go fast, no investments will make it stagnant. The workers part in this is to accept and spend the pay for the jobs they perform to PRODUCE (for the investors) the goods and services necessary to keep everybody supplied with their demands and more.\n \n Reward production and production will flourish, bringing with it new jobs and higher wages for those worker bees to spend. It will also bring higher profits for those producers to either spend by pumping back into their own business investment or spend by investing in other producer's companies or spend by purchasing consummables that were manufactured by some other producer.\n \n Punish production and the wheels will slow or stop, causing the workers to lose jobs and wages (spending power).

Some people should receive welfare payments whether they produce or not.\n \n This is not being argued here.\n \n The rich and middle class already pay most of the income taxes. Some of them should be forced to pay many times over what they are paying now. The Kennedy clan (who made their fortune in illegal activities) are excluding themselves from the estate tax program by sheltering all their wealth in foundations and trusts that they maintain control of and continue to benefit from and pass on to the next generation of their own.\n \n There are many legal loopholes that the very wealthy use to avoid paying taxes even though their incomes are astoundingly high compared to the commoners who pay the bulk of total government revenue.\n \n That discrepancy could be done away with by using the Fair Tax.

What these proponents ignore, however, is that the tax increases occurred at a time when the economy was recovering from recession and strong growth was to be expected. They also ignore that the real acceleration in the economy began in 1997, when economic growth should have cooled. This acceleration in growth coincided with a powerful pro-growth tax cut.\n \n The evidence is persuasive that the tax increase probably slowed the economy compared to the growth it would have achieved and that the subsequent tax cuts of 1997, not the tax increases, were the source of the acceleration in real growth in the latter half of the decade. As taxes are now above their historical average as a share of the economy, and are rising, Congress should look to enact additional tax relief to keep the economy strong.\n \n J.D.

It's not perfect, but it's better than standard capitalism and has the advantage of being able to function within the present system, reducing the need for a violent and unpredictable revolution.\nI think a well informed person will agree that there are some favorable results that come from some forms of collectivism. (My husband tells me of his collective clothes policy that he and three others had in college...they pooled their shirts and wore them without regard to who had bought it. It worked well for them, but I do not think it argues for government ownership of everyone's clothes.)\n \n What you describe seems to still utilize the concept of ownership. It is when the government owns things that things become poorly run. It also appears that the philosophies of the owners of the supermarket have struck a good balance between rewarding those who work while maintaining private ownership. I suspect they have lines of people wanting to be part of their company. This would then be another example of where the increases experienced from giving things away outweigh the loss of what was given away. (Give the workers more and they will happily produce more of what pays them.) I would certainly agree that many corporate executives ludicrous salaries should be subdivided more equally with those who actually did the work.\n \n We have digressed some from the tax question and the interpretations of numbers regarding revenue vs. rates.\n \n Where is the lambasting reply to my latest link? I've been expecting someone with socialist leanings or misleading arguments to come up with a rebuttal attempt of some sort.",

   "What should happen is that we leave the CGT where it is and reduce spending drastically by way of several steps:\n \n 1\n Cut the size of the government work force. (Not by gutting the military, but by reducing the staff of every over-stuffed government office, including staff for our representatives.)\n \n 2\n Cut government perks for elected and appointed officials.\n \n 3\n Cut earmark spending and grants for projects that do not improve our lot.\n\n Your three step plan has several flaws to it. The biggest problem is you could literally cut everything you have here 100% and still run a huge deficit. In fact, you could 100% of the lower 75% of the departments and still run a deficit. The only insanely over-stuffed government office is the Department of Defense yet this is the one you suggest we don't cut. DHHS, DOD, and SSA make up the vast majority of our expenditures. It would be hard to default on all of SSA and DHHS without completely killing our economy. If you cut DoD you will have an economic fall out that is probably more temporarily such as the one that happened after WWII. \n \n If you want to help the government you should cut military spending in half (gradual over 4-8yrs), reform medicare and Social security and other entitlement programs gradually with Medicare first and immediate. This would have to be done carefully as to not disturb our debt reissues, increase spending on infrastructure...I might suggest alternative fuels and earth friendly technology since that is only business we can probably do now (but also do infrastructure upgrades on other levels such as internet and what not). If you do fuels that are made from corn or other plants you could start cutting down subsidies for farmers thus reducing the Dept of Ag expenditures. Most other (somewhat high dollar) departments should probably be cut by 25% with DOE taking a bigger hit and total reform because they are worthless. \n \n Now if our country can handle this massive shock of a change in 10-15yrs you can lower the debt and thus make a reasonable tax rate structure (still progressive though). \n \n Finally, the arguments about \"pork\" spending costing us money are totally bogus. Those make up next to nothing in terms of total costs and probably help the economy more than some of the other programs we have (such as building needed highways). The ROI is much higher than the dept of defense I'm sure. Another common argument is that areas like NASA are a waste of money. NASA as a 16 billion dollar budget. This is actually fairly small and NASA actually serves, in my opinion, a benefit to society in that they educate and spark interest in areas for kids. I'm sure many on these forums have been to Space Camp haha. So even though they are inefficient and wasteful on an independent look, on a total look they are really small peanuts. This is the same for Amtrak, and EPA, SBA, and a few others.",

You can then plot this in excel very easily. You can then use the correlation function between the receipts and tax rate to see that the correlation will come between .3 and .4 which indicates very little to no correlation. Also if you graph it you will notice a spike in 1987 when you CGT rate rose. The realization the year prior to this was insanely high because everyone knew it was going up. It then went down sharp the next year. Now if you remove that point you will notice the trend is actually the same suggesting that realization doesn't really go up or down in the long term but will in the year immediately before a tax increase. \n \n So I also took the liberty to do a rough correlation with against GDP (which granted is not great).

Even the romans understood that if you taxed your people too heavily they would not have enough money left to prosper so your tax revenues would ultimately fall off. \n \n There is a quote from David Stockman (reagans budget director) that probably rates as one of the 10 most famous quotes of any economist in our day (economists do not get quoted all that often):\n \n \nThe whole California gang had taken the Laffer curve literally (and primitively). The way they talked, they seemed to expect that once the supply-side tax cut was in effect, additional revenue would start to fall, manna-like, from the heavens. Since January, I had been explaining that there is no literal Laffer curve.\n\n \n The theory behind the Laffer curve essentially states that at some point an increase in taxation actually reduces government revenue because of decreased productivity due to loss of expansion capital. Reagan made the mistake of missing the \"at some point\" and just latched onto the idea that cutting taxes would bolster the economy, thus increasing revenue. \n \n The CBO pretty much killed off that fallacy in their report entitled \"Analyzing the Economic and Budgetary Effects of a 10 Percent Cut in Income Tax Rates\".

   "What were we talking about????\n \n \n It's hard to say 100% whether or not tax cuts 'bring in more revenue' because we can't know exactly what would have happened if they weren't cut. However, the fact that the economy seems to respond well to tax breaks fits in with, what I see to be, human nature. People with more incentive tend to work harder and produce more. Also, they tend to 'cheat' less on their taxes. When capital is doing well jobs are being created and everyone does better. We've seen that, again and again, when taxes are lowered the economy responds positively and when they are too high the economy suffers. That would tend to support that More money is coming in (because there's more money being made, spent, paid, and earned).\n \n \n http://taxesandgrowth.ncpa.org/news/do-the-rich-and-businesses-pay-their-fair-share\n \n Critics of Bush's three tax relief plans charge that only the wealthy benefited from the reductions in marginal tax rates. But is this true? And more broadly, do the wealthiest Americans pay their \"fair share\" of the tax burden?\n \n The evidence shows that all Americans, rich and poor, benefited from President Bush's tax cuts. The rich saw taxes on their dividends and capital gains reduced (as well as their income taxes), and personal income tax rates were slashed across the board, which encompassed every middle-class taxpayer. Even the poor, who generally do not pay income taxes, were rewarded with a higher Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and child tax credits.\n \n Progressivity and the Tax Burden\n Our tax system, however, is highly progressive, meaning that as one's income rises, a higher proportion of that income is taxed. Thus, those in the highest tax brackets contribute more to the overall tax burden even though there are far more people in lower tax brackets.1\n \n According to data from the IRS, the bottom 50 percent of income earners pay approximately 4 percent of income taxes. \n The top 25 percent of income earners pay nearly 83 percent of the income tax burden, and the top 10 percent pay 65 percent.\n The top 1 percent of income earners pay almost 35 percent of all income taxes. \n The top 400 richest Americans paid 1.58 of total income taxes in 2000.",

But how are you going to prove it was the tax cut, and not government spending, which we know through Keynesian Economics that increased economic activity? Furthermore, how do we know it wasn't some other factor, such as foreign investment that was unrelated to the tax cut that increased economic activity?

As for 'reasonable' that all depends on the person. Some people may feel a 50% tax rate is reasonable given expenditures, debt levels, etc. Where some people may feel that even 10% is not acceptable.

   "You keep saying that rich people don't mind paying taxes. I'm sorry, but I know LOTS of rich people (I clean their houses). They have scads of lawyers and accounts so as to pay less taxes. Now, when they perceive taxes as more fair (as they do since the tax cuts) they are apt to fire some of the lawyers and accountants. If you increase the tax burden much they will rehire those lawyers, find tax shelters, and scale back tax prone investments. Trust me, rich people didn't get that way by cheering when people take money away from them and hand it to someone else who didn't earn it.\n\n \n ROTFLMAO. So they fire their tax attorneys and accountants when taxes go down a bit??? DREAM ON. Only an idiot would do that. You can fill an entire bookshelf with our tax code. Money spent on a good tax attorney and a good accountant/accountants is repaid at about 400%. \n \n Rich people also did not get that way by failing to understand how our economy works, why infrastructure investment through taxation primarily benifits the rich, and the fact that social programs have little or nothing to do with compassion for the poor and EVERYTHING to do with keeping a ready supply of cheap labor available and that it is cheaper to feed people than to fight them. Even guys like Forbes, who is generally viewed as kind of a ##### even among the rich, recognize this. He just prefers the \"fight\" to the \"feed\". If we were in Europe where it was more acceptable to do so, he would form a fascist ticket and run on it.\n \n \nBy the time you match SSI and unemployement insurance + liability and worker's comp it about doubles the per hour cost. I don't know what the exact figure is, but its pretty close.\n\n \n As Steeeve points out, employment taxes come nowhere CLOSE to doubling your workers wage. If liability and workmans comp are making up the difference there, you REALLY need to either see about cleaning up your credit or do a little shopping around for better rates. You are paying a LOT more than you should be. Liability and Workmans comp for a cleaning company should not be that bad. Being EXTREMELY generous, a 25% premium over wages should more than cover you on that front.",

Even if wages were so low and firing so easy that you could take people on a whim, companies still wouldn't do it due to increased risk of theft. Wages are not the only impediment to hiring, and benefits are not the only reason not to work. The high cost of transportation, due to deregulation of buses and privatisation and reduction in service on trains, is an impediment to anyone wanting to seek work.

You can drop into the conversation whatever anecdote you want, but that's the logical implication of labor costs ~=0. \n \n\n \n This is illogical. While it is certainly true that somebody could have stepped up and offered jobs at 1p per year, it would be impossible for an individual to actually work for that and still survive. \n \n This is one of the primary reasons that we HAVE a minimum wage. In the past there have been times when \"employers\" have not paid their workers well enough to provide for basic material needs (shelter, clothing, etc..) or even enough food to replace the calories burned while working at their jobs. People literally starved to death while working 60 hour weeks. \n \n In such a situation it is foolish to continue working. There are better, more productive ways to spend your time like foraging or stealing or murdering well off people and eating them.\n \n It is not as uncommon for work to not be economically viable as you might think. I spend a pretty good amount of time helping displaced production workers figure out how they are going to put food on their table and shoes on their kids feet and quite often it just does not make sense for both parents to work. I was helping a couple the other day. He went from making $27 /hr at a now closed meat packing plant to making $12.20 an hour working at a local junk yard. His wife was looking at taking a job as a receptionist at $8.00/hr. They have 3 kids about the same age as mine (5, 3, 2). \n \n The problem was that once you did the math and factored in day care costs, additional clothing costs (since the job required a better wardrobe than is required for mommyhood), vehicle costs (fuel and maintenance) and other work related expenses she would have actually LOST 20 cents per hour by working that job.\n \n This is a lot of the reason that our welfare roles are stuffed full of single mothers. Childcare is a significant enough expense that most of them cannot make it on a job that pays less than $10 per hour. Recently my state (Kansas) expanded aid for childcare expenses and the number of people receiving cash welfare benefits shrank by nearly 20% (now it is rising again due to unemployment problems). \n \n History has shown that employers are more than willing to pay people starvation wages unless there is some kind of regulatory framework that says \"you have to do better than that\". \n \n Minimum wage laws are pretty much just like social welfare laws. They keep people just well fed enough that they do not kill and eat the rest of us. There are some places in Africa and S America that lack any kind of worker protection and have no social welfare programs. If you visit them, you will find that you really need bodyguards armed with automatic weapons if you want to move freely. \n \n I went to Argentina a while back to look at some real estate. The place I was considering was a large compound way out in the country. When I pulled into the parking lot where I was supposed to meet the agent who was taking me out there to see it, I was a little alarmed to find about a dozen HEAVILY armed men standing around. I turned the truck I was driving around to beat a hasty retreat and about slammed into the agent who was pulling in. He told me not to be alarmed...he had hired the heavily armed men to escort us and make sure we got there and back in one piece.\n \n That is more or less what has always happened when the free marketers have gotten their way. Free markets are fine...to a point.",
