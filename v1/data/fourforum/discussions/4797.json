   "Washington Post said the other day, that Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili is trying to bear pressure upon Human Rights Watch and its NGO partner in Georgia - Association for Protection of Human Rights and Freedoms.\n \n WP said, HRW drew President Bush's attention to the fact that they have certain documents in hand which give evidence that Mikhail Saakashvili and Georgian Minister of Defence Irakli Okruashvili gave personal orders for tortures of their political opponents and were also personally involved into numerous violations of human rights in Georgia. According to HRW, Georgian President Saakashvili is now trying to get back the evidence in fear that they will come to George Bush.\n \n As for HRW, it is planning to use George W. Bush's visit to Georgia in May to gain his support in the sphere of human rights protection in Georgia. Maybe, they will finally punish him?",
