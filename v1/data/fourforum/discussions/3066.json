   "The Rambo Granny of Melbourne, Australia\n \n \n Gun-toting granny Ava Estelle, 81, was so ticked-off when two thugs raped her 18-year-old granddaughter that she tracked the unsuspecting ex-cons down - - and shot off their testicles.\n \n The old lady spent a week hunting those men down -- and when she found them, she took revenge on them in her own special way, said Melbourne police investigator Evan Delp. Then she took a taxi to the nearest police station, laid the gun on the sergeant's desk and told him as calm as could be:\n \n 'Those bastards will never rape anybody again, by God.' Cops say convicted rapist and robber Davis Furth, 33, lost both his penis and his testicles when outraged Ava opened fire with a 9-mm pistol in the hotel room where he and former prison cellmate Stanley Thomas, 29, were holed up.\n \n The wrinkled avenger also blew Thomas' testicles to kingdom come, but doctors managed to save his mangled penis, police said. The one guy, Thomas, didn't lose his manhood, but the doctor I talked to said he won't be using it the way he used to, Detective Delp told reporters. Both men are still in pretty bad shape, but I think they're just happy to be alive after what they've been through.\n \n The Rambo Granny swung into action August 21 after her granddaughter Debbie was carjacked and raped in broad daylight by two knife-wielding creeps in a section of town bordering on skid row. \"When I saw the look on my Debbie's face that night in the hospital, I decided I was going to go out and get those bastards myself 'cause I figured the Law would go easy on them,\" recalled the retired library worker. \"And I wasn't scared of them, either-- because I've got me a gun and I've been shootin' all my life. And I wasn't dumb enough to turn it in when the law changed about owning one.\"\n \n So, using a police artist's sketch of the suspects and Debbie's description of the sickos', tough-as-nails Ava spent seven days prowling the wino-infested neighborhood where the crime took place till she spotted the ill fated rapists entering their flophouse hotel.\n \n I knew it was them the minute I saw 'em, but I shot a picture of 'em anyway and took it back to Debbie and she said sure as hell, it was them, the oldster recalled.\n \n So I went back to that hotel and found their room and knocked on the door and the minute the big one, Furth, opened the door, I shot 'em right square between the legs, right where it would really hurt 'em most, you know. \n Then I went in and shot the other one as he backed up pleading to me to spare him. Then I went down to the police station and turned myself in.\n \n Now, baffled lawmen are trying to figure out exactly how to deal with the vigilante granny. What she did was wrong, and she broke the law, but it is difficult to throw an 81-year-old woman in prison, Det. Delp said, especially when 3 million people in the city want to nominate her for sainthood and a medal.\n \n DEPORT HER TO AMERICA -- WE NEED HER!!!",

You don't care what people do things, but the surface layer of what they did. Without a understanding and interest in why people do things, you will never have a true understanding of the law or even the concept of law and order. \n \n \n\n That definition of yours is about as screwed up as one can get.\n\n \n That definition of yours is about as screwed up as one can get, right back at you. \n \n \n\n I totally understand the phrase. You just have no grasp of logic.\n\n \n Actually it is you who doesn't understand logic. You dismiss the rational as why people did certain acts. You care only about what superificially they did. Without a understanding of rational, you will never really understand double standards. \n \n \n\n You see. I knew you'd come back with the same tired argument.\n\n \n You see. I knew you'd come back with the same tired argument, right back at you. \n \n \n\n Apparently, you don't drive much.\n\n \n Notice your complete and utter failure to disprove a single part of what you just quoted. You FAILED HARD to prove any of your speeding claims. You FAILED COMPLETELY to disprove why people speed. You FAILED MISERABLY to actually argue with substace. YOU FAILED.\n \n \n\n Rationale.\n\n \n arQguements basWed arounEd gramRmar arTe a sigYn of shUeer laIck of substPance as weSll as comAplete eGmbrace of superificBality. I'm gMoing to mXock yEou noYw.\n \n \n\n I'm very perceptive. I don't want your money.\n\n \n Prove your claim. Oh wait you will fail horribly, miserably, utterly, and completely to prove what you claim like you always do I don't even know why I offered, I know you wouldn't be able to. Failure. Complete Failure.\n \n \n\n I'm just curious as to where you formed the opinion that I'm anti-gay.\n\n \n Oh just using the stereotype of pro-bushers and pro wars are usually anti-gay marriage proponents. Which has turned out to be correct. \n \n \n\n Yes. Yes. Yes.\n\n \n I don't think you do. You apparently don't understand why the two people did what they did for the same reason. You apparently don't understand how rational affects decisions. You apparently resort to arguments where you love superificality.\n \n \n\n Parroting me is a compliment, but you should try to think of some original stuff.\n\n \n I don't need to. Using your arguments aganist you is simple enough. Much of what you say applies to you. All i need to do is copy paste. \n \n \n\n I'm not in agreement with you, but I will cease to argue this point. You are entirely too dense for me.\n\n \n Right. You are the one who fails to understand the point of reason in actions. Who is the one who is dense?\n \n Btw: you failed. hard.",
