   "Thank you for your thoughtful question.\n \n \n**\n I was just wondering if anyone believed that there are \"laws\" of biological evolution in the same sense that we speak of, say, 'laws' of thermodynamics, or of gravitation, or whatever, and if they do, would they outline them for us?\n\n \n The idea of laws of nature concerns the most fundamental principles we know of about how the universe works. That means physics. Chemistry doesn't qualify, nor does biology. But the idea of laws coming from a lawgiver (the original usage) is completely outside what science can deal with. So scientists don't talk about it any more while doing science.\n \n \nI have heard of five 'laws' of darwinism, but I'm not sure that they qualify as 'laws' in that sense. These basic principles are given as,\n\n \n You can tell that these are not authentic scientific statements by the use of the word \"Darwinism\", which is mainly used by Creationists to imply that evolution is a religion. Scientists speak of evolutionary biology. Where did you find these?\n \n \n\n 1/'Evolution' means that no lifeform is essentially different from any other lifeform, but is merely accidentally different,-- the 'same thing', but with different accidental properties, that is, 'traits', that are only comparative differences in material quantities expressed in a continuum, and not qualities expressed as separate quanta according to any other criterion. Nothing ever changes in any essential aspect, nor ever has done.\n\n \n The notions of substance and accidents, of quanta and qualia, of essences, are Aristotelian. Scientists haven't talked that way for centuries. If we were to apply this point of view to chemistry, we would note that material objects are all just different arrangements of the same atoms. So what? God never changes in any essential aspect either. Again, so what?\n \n \n2/'Common Descent', meaning that there are no separate and distinct 'lines of descent' in evolution, but only one continuum of descent from one initial start point. A sort of, \"Big Bang\", wrt life.\n\n \n This is simply meaningless. Of course there are separate lines of descent. And there wasn't a start point. A start, yes, but not a point. Prebiotic evolution of proteins and nucleic acid chains was in operation throughout the oceans of the entire Earth for many millions of years, at least, before the first cells appeared.\n \n \n\n \n 3/'Variation' of life forms derives from multiplication of life forms. That is, that the number of life forms extent cannot remain constant, but must continuously and vigourously generate a huge number of new forms, a number far greater than are currently suited any local environment. \n\n \n False, in any useful sense. There are of course huge numbers of individuals, each with a different set of genes, in any species with sexual reproduction.\n \n Given the rate at which offspring of an organism reach maturity and reproduce, we can deduce a comparable rate of reproduction that is required for survival. If one in a thousand survive to reproduce, females must average a thousand eggs. Since reproduction is costly to organisms, those that do best produce neither too few offspring nor too many.\n \n \n\n \n 4/ 'Gradualism', that is, that biological change [evolution] is an unbroken continuum of small adjustments, mostly in the quantitative measurements [sizes] related to physical parts. See #1. That meaning that there can be no abrupt change from one lifeform to another, although the speed at which an lifeform passes through a continuum of minor quantitative changes so as to become distinguishable from the original lifeform, may or may not be accelerated, in terms of 'geologic time'.\n\n \n False. Most evolutionary change is gradual, but this is not a requirement. There have been numerous mutations changing the number of pairs of legs of various animals all at once. This is how we have four-legged amphibians, reptiles, and mammals, six-legged insects, eight-legged arachnids, centipedes, millipedes, and others. Also humans with six fingers on each hand. The changes from two-chambered hearts to three chambers and then to four were sudden. Monocot plants to dicots. Single-trunk trees, such as palm trees, to branching trees.\n \n \n5/'Natural Selection', that is, a postulated mechanical force that continuously sorts those lifeforms that are currently compatible with their local environments from those that are not, and eliminates the latter. This necessitates the existence of #3, above, and is necessitated by it.\n\n \n False in at least four different ways. Natural Selection is not a mechanical force. Sorting is unnecessary and irrelevant. Compatibility with an environment is not an all-or-nothing property. The less-compatible traits are not eliminated from the genome, they just are not expressed as often. Natural selection is simply a fact: in the extreme case, individuals die from whatever kills them, and the kinds that don't get killed make up a greater fraction of the remaining population in the next generation. But death is not a requirement. All that matters is the number of offspring that individuals have that survive to maturity.\n \n Take traditional corn farming as an example. (Not industrial monoculture farming with genetically identical seed.) The corn is a mixture of similar, but not identical varieties, known as a land race. If the weather is relatively dry one year, the more drought-tolerant plants will produce more seeds per plant in the next generation than the less-tolerant ones, so the next year the farmer will have a slightly more drought-tolerant mix of varieties. If the year after is wetter, the varieties that grow faster with more water increase faster, and similarly for insect infestations and anything else that affects how the corn grows.\n \n \nAny comments? Please note that these opinions are not mine, and may not even be the actual opinions held by darwinists. I'd just like to know what 'laws' and 'facts' people believe are incontrovertible wrt evolution.\n\n \n First, evolution is a fact, not a theory or a hypothesis. There is no other way to explain the evidence within the framework of nature. There were dinosaurs. There was a time when the Earth had no life on it, and then it did. All of the millions of known species use the same genetic machinery, and many genes are nearly identical in all cells, from bacteria to blue whales.\n \n Second, speciation through natural selection is one of the most successful theoretical ideas in the history of science. It is now buttressed by all that we know of molecular biology, including the entire machinery of DNA, RNA, protein coding, and so on.\n \n Third, the Bible is not a scientific treatise. The Jewish priests and prophets who wrote and compiled the books of the Bible had quite other purposes in mind. In fact, the idea of science didn't exist at the time.",

The only one I've ever heard is that the Hardy-Weinberg Principle is sometimes referred to as the Hardy-Weinberg Law.\n \nI have heard of five 'laws' of darwinism, but I'm not sure that they qualify as 'laws' in that sense. These basic principles are given as,\nThat's funny. I've never heard of five 'laws' of darwinism. What creationist did you learn them from?\n \n1/'Evolution' means that no lifeform is essentially different from any other lifeform, but is merely accidentally different,-- the 'same thing', but with different accidental properties, that is, 'traits', that are only comparitive differences in material quantities expressed in a continuum, and not qualities expressed as separate quanta according to any other criterion. Nothing ever changes in any essential aspect, nor ever has done.\nThat's not a law and your summary is grossly in error. Evolution proper was one of the five theories expressed by Darwin in \"On The Origin Of Species,\" and it wasn't original with Darwin. What Darwin meant and what it still means is that lineages of organisms change through time.\n \n2/'Common Descent', meaning that there are no separate and distinct 'lines of descent' in evolution, but only one continuum of descent from one initial start point. A sort of, \"Big Bang\", wrt life.\nCommon Descent was a theory that was original with Darwin. What Darwin proposed was a tree of life that did in fact form distinct lines of descent from a common origin. You know, like lions and tigers and like the 13 species of Darwin finches, and like wolves, coyotes, and foxes.\n \n3/'Variation' of life forms derives from multiplication of life forms. That is, that the number of life forms extent cannot remain constant, but must continuously and vigourously generate a huge number of new forms, a number far greater than are currently suited any local environment.\nNot even a theory of evolution today. In fact, variation in living organisms was an observation. \n \n4/ 'Gradualism', that is, that biological change [evolution] is an unbroken continuum of small adjustments, mostly in the quantitative measurements [sizes] related to physical parts. See #1. That meaning that there can be no abrupt change from one lifeform to another, although the speed at which an lifeform passes through a continuum of minor quantitative changes so as to become distinguishable from the original lifeform, may or may not be accelerated, in terms of 'geologic time'.\nAnother theory that was original with Darwin. What Darwin said was that evolution (although Darwin didn't call it evolution - he didn't like the word applied to his theories) proceeds through intermediate forms by the accumulation of a series of innumerable small steps.\n \n5/'Natural Selection', that is, a postulated mechanical force that continuously sorts those lifeforms that are currently compatible with their local environments from those that are not, and eliminates the latter. This necessitates the existence of #3, above, and is necessitated by it.\nVery badly stated, thus it makes it quite clear that you don't have a very good understanding of natural selection. Natural selection isn't a mechanical force. It is a mathematical tendency for some organisms to have more offspring than others. Again, variation was one of the observations that led Darwin to the theory of natural selection.\n \nAny comments?

   "I've never heard those five concepts from WW's opening post referred to as laws. #1 sounds like something out of a critique of the species concept based in the framework of Aristotelian essentialism and Platonic ideals. #2 is certainly a major conclusion for extant lineages (with the proviso that the early history of life could involve a lot of symbiosis and 'sym-prebiosis', up to and including such possibilities as a non-living cell-membrane-like thing combining with a naked-gene-like thing to form a more life-like ensemble). #3 follows from #2, although not all in one generation. #4 has seen a lot of discussion wwith respect to the meaning of \"gradual\" in geological time frames. #5 is thought to be a dominant process, but not one that is necessary in all cases. Therefore, none of these statements sounds sufficiently definitive for biologists to want to call them laws (except perhaps #3, but that is rather strangely stated).\n \n Unlike chemists and physicists, biologists and geologists don't much talk about scientific \"laws\" (other than ones from chemistry and physics). In the 1800's, biologists were happy enough proposing \"laws\" (Hackel's biogenetic law, Dollo's law), but those mostly turned out to be wrong, or at minimum to need extensive codicils or whatever. Thus, we mostly stay away from the term (the Hardy-Weinberg law and, more recently, universal scaling laws, being exceptions). \n \n Originally, it seemed that laws should outrank theories, but laws do not necessarily contain an explanation, and may only express a statistical pattern that is evident in the aggregate (e.g., the laws of thermodynamics). Possibly our aversion to 'laws' is because biology and geology sometimes seem like one giant exercise in discovering exceptions to principles and patterns that had previously seemed simple, so patterns seen 'in the aggregate' turn out to be neither simple nor easily exlained. This stems from the complexity of the things being studied, and particularly with the abundance of convergence and multiplicity. Convergence (not sensu evolutionary convergence but sensu scientific philosophy) is when any of several different processes and pathways can eventually produce the same end result. Multiplicity is something resulting from several causes operating in combination. (Emergence is when multiple factors combine to produce new patterns that were not evident in the factors when considered in isolation. Examples are wetness in molecules formed by combining one H and two O, or insolation changes and climatic cycles produced by combining Milankovich orbital irregularities.) These prevent biology and geology from relying on strict reductionism, the way chemistry and physics can. So overall biologists and geologists are actually happier with general principles and powerful and fruitful theories that yield consilient conclusions.\n \n \nIsn't it funny how mturner (ww) melts down in a frenzy of spew and insult when he is handed his XXX?

What an inane, vacuous piece of abject stupidity! Typical pandion product. Pure feces. Nothing more cogent than a bad smell.\n No, that doesn't follow.

The best anyone offered was criticism of the talking-points--nobody made any effort to actually speak to the real issue, that is, the existence of principles, universals, constants, forces, facts, and so forth, that pertain to evolution in the same manner in which they pertain to any other branch of scientific study.\n \n \n\n Unlike chemists and physicists, biologists and geologists don't much talk about scientific \"laws\" (other than ones from chemistry and physics).\n\n \n **\n Now, why is that, I wonder?!?\n \n \n\n In the 1800's, biologists were happy enough proposing \"laws\" (Hackel's biogenetic law, Dollo's law), but those mostly turned out to be wrong, or at minimum to need extensive codicils or whatever. Thus, we mostly stay away from the term (the Hardy-Weinberg law and, more recently, universal scaling laws, being exceptions). \n\n \n **\n Now, why do they mostly turn out to be wrong, I wonder?!?\n \n \n\n Originally, it seemed that laws should outrank theories, but laws do not necessarily contain an explanation, and may only express a statistical pattern that is evident in the aggregate (e.g., the laws of thermodynamics).\n\n \n **\n IOW, \"laws\" are simply recognition of natural regularities and constants of a certain kind that allow a high degree of accurate prediction, i.e., correlation, from 'cause' to 'effect', in a general, one might say, universal, context. In this case, the context of evolution. \n Which is fine by me, since that recognition is the heart of science itself. Other 'sciences' have such things, so I would expect to see them in evolutionary biology as well. I'm just asking people what they think they are.\n \n \n\n Possibly our aversion to 'laws' is because biology and geology sometimes seem like one giant exercise in discovering exceptions to principles and patterns that had previously seemed simple, so patterns seen 'in the aggregate' turn out to be neither simple nor easily exlained. This stems from the complexity of the things being studied, and particularly with the abundance of convergence and multiplicity. Convergence (not sensu evolutionary convergence but sensu scientific philosophy) is when any of several different processes and pathways can eventually produce the same end result. Multiplicity is something resulting from several causes operating in combination. \n\n \n **\n Complexity is a difficulty wrt our understanding of reality, without question, and nothing, not even sub-atomic physics, seems so complex as biology. But although the degree of difficulty in understanding biosystems is several orders of magnitude greater than our difficulty in understanding machine operations and mechanical processes, it seems to me to be evasive to say that they are too complex for description in normal scientific terms. \n \n \n\n (Emergence is when multiple factors combine to produce new patterns that were not evident in the factors when considered in isolation. Examples are wetness in molecules formed by combining one H and two O, \n\n \n **\n Actually, [or so I've read], there is no 'wetness' in a single water molecule, per se. It takes two or more water molecules [or perhaps a water molecule and a molecule of something else, I'm not sure] before the relation that the two [or more] molecules have between them produces a phenomenon that we refer to as as 'wetness'. So 'wetness' is NOT truly an instance of 'emergence' , i.e., an intrinsic property which arises simply by the [eg., atomic] conjoining of 2 or more parts [eg., 1 hydrogen atom with 2 oxygen atoms] that do not possess that property [eg., wetness] into a whole [eg.,a single water molecule] that does possess it .\n \n \n\n or insolation changes and climatic cycles produced by combining Milankovich orbital irregularities.) These prevent biology and geology from relying on strict reductionism, the way chemistry and physics can.\n\n \n **\n On that much we can agree. But surely science and its concepts are not dependent upon reductionism, are they?\n \n \n\n So overall biologists and geologists are actually happier with general principles and powerful and fruitful theories that yield consilient conclusions.\n\n \n **\n Well, I'm all for general principles. That's the subject of this thread. The general principles of evolutionary biology. What they are, and how they were derived. After all the word 'principle' is defined as-- [answers.com]\n \"prin\u00b7ci\u00b7ple (pr&#301;n's&#601;-p&#601;l) \n n.\n A basic truth, law, or assumption: the principles of democracy.\n \n A rule or standard, especially of good behavior: a man of principle.\n The collectivity of moral or ethical standards or judgments: a decision based on principle rather than expediency.\n A fixed or predetermined policy or mode of action.\n A basic or essential quality or element determining intrinsic nature or characteristic behavior: the principle of self-preservation.\n A rule or law concerning the functioning of natural phenomena or mechanical processes: the principle of jet propulsion. [bold added to what I think most pertinent-ww]\n \n As for your \"powerful and fruitful theories\", you are either referring to hypotheses that, _after_ testing and validation produce 'general principles', or you are referring to rationalizations based upon 'a priori' metaphysical assumptions used to 'explain' empirical observations, 'ex post facto'. Hopefully it is the former, not the latter, but we have no way of knowing at this point.\n \n And as to \"consilient conclusions\", given the dictionary meaning of 'consilience',[concurrence, agreement], are we not back to 'general principles', or even 'universal laws'?\n \n \n\n To be fair, in this particular thread he got pretty nastily insulted prior to releasing his inner beserker.\n\n \n **\n Right. I give back as good and better than I get, so I'm a 'berserker', while t all the ditto-head attack dogs are perfectly well-behaved, just a sane and self-controlled as dry toast. Duh! But at least you make a half-hearted attempt to be honest and fair, I'll give you that much.\n \n \n\n No, that doesn't follow. Whether or not we lack 'laws of biology' does not impinge on our abundance of facts, constraints, principles, and forces (and influences).\n\n \n **\n It shouldn't, but pandion, [not me], seemed to lump them all together, simply by referring to the one and ignoring the rest. So, that said, just what does constitute, \"our abundance of facts, constraints, principles, and forces (and influences)\"?",

   "I agree that you need multiple molecules of water to experience wetness, but that only reinforces the point that wetness is an emergent property.\n \n Thinking about scientific laws some more, we have plenty of things in geology that we could call laws or express as laws if we were so inclined.

I said that they were all incorrect, with reference to evidence and reason. You have not responded, even to thank me for my trouble, although you have commented favorably on my post in another context. My comments were not simply negative. I pointed out what was wrong with the quoted statements, and also explained some of the truth about these matters, as I see it, and as quite a few evolutionary biologists (not Darwinists; there is no such thing) see it. Contrary to your statement, I DID give some of the principles of evolution. That they do not conform to your prejudices about the form of Natural Law is not my fault, nor is it the fault of the truth, nor is it God's fault. God made the Universe as it is, according to your theology, not as you in your ignorance might wish it to be. Yes, I do believe you to be ignorant, thought not astoundingly so based on my own experience. But I don't mean it as an insult. I am quite ignorant of many things, and I become more aware of it all the time.\n \n Job 38:1-2,4: Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?...Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding...\n \n Job 40:1-2: Moreover the Lord answered Job, and said, Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? He that reproveth God, let him answer it.\n \n Job 42:1,3: Then Job answered the Lord and said,...Truly, I have uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, that I knew not.\n \n Science is a constant struggle against ignorance and bias about nature, as religion is a constant struggle against pride and a few other notable problems of the spirit. Both science and religion are worthy endeavors, with fundamentally different and fundamentally non-conflicting areas of concern. We are inviting you to join in the scientific struggle. That is the fundamental principle of science: the struggle combined with the invitation. In comparison, theories are mere details.\n \n I can provide more answers to your questions if you will first respond to what I said, so that I can judge what you have understood and what you have not, and also what you believe among the things I said and what you do not. Then we can discuss these matters point by point and clear them up. I do not expect you to agree with everything I say, but I do expect you to make the effort to understand why I say it, and not weasel out by accusing me of ignorance, stupidity, or bad faith.\n \n PS Thank you for your kind words about my previous post. I try to be polite and helpful. You can help me try to get these others to shape up by dropping your own ad hominem attacks, and responding to the substance of what is said.",

And since one whole water molecule does not possessess 'wetness', but needs another molecule, of water or whatever, to generate the phenomenon, 'wetness' is just one more phenomenon generated by two or more whole entities reacting to each other, and is not an 'emergent property', as defined.\n \n \n\n They turned out to be wrong because science advances by posing multiple working hypotheses and then proving some of the MWH's wrong.\n\n \n **\n This makes no sense. \"Laws\" are supposed to be 'hypotheses' that have been shown to be consistently and dependably accurate after being repeatedly tested by the scientific method. 'Hypotheses' are often wrong, 'theories' may be inaccuarate or insufficient, but \"laws\" are supposed to be tried, true, and universal, at least with only a few anomalous exceptions. If this is not the case, if 'laws' do not really exist, then how is reality to be considered knowable and rational? Now, perhaps only physics has anything that may be seen as a 'law', I don't know, but surely biology has regularities and constants that can be translated into general principles. Or are we to say that biology is unknowable and irrational?\n \n \n\n It is not helpful to propose an hypothesis but to call it a law when you propose it, which is what Haeckel and Dollo did.\n\n \n **\n It isn't merely \"unhelpful\". It's either stupid, or in Haeckel's case, dishonest. I would suggest that much the same applies to calling an 'hypothesis', a 'theory'. Unless you wish to define 'theory' as meaning no more than, 'elaborate hypothesis'.

For example,\n \n 1) Natural selection can only work on characteristics that are beneficial to the individuals that possess the trait that is being selected.\n\n \n **\n Wrong. Just the opposite is the reality here. From Darwin on, \"NS\" has been understood as subtractive, not additive. That is, \"NS\" has always meant a natural elimination of bioforms 'unfitted to their environment', not 'the generation of novel bioforms 'fitted to their environment'. That was why Darwin had to re-write Lamarck and Fisher had to invent 'random mutation' in order to account for what \"NS\" did not--i.e., \"characteristics that are beneficial to the individuals\" [i.e., enable it to overcome, to get past, 'selection']. \n \n \n\n Altruism and 'for the good of the species' don't pass muster. If something looks like being bad for the individual, it cannot experience positive selection (there must be some hidden benefit for the individuals possessing the trait).\n\n \n **\n \"Positive selection\" is just Humpty Dumpty's way of saying, \"selection -free\", or, \"unselected\" or just plain, \"unaffected by adverse environmental agencies\".\n \n \n\n 2) The accumulation of small changes over time can result in big changes over very long periods of time.\n\n \n **\n Which only means something when speaking in quantitative terms, such as getting larger/smaller, heavier/lighter, longer/shorter, thicker/thinner, etc. But in such cases you do not change the nature of anything, you only change how much there is of it.

   "**\n Sorry, neil, but you are wrong. \"Emergent properties\" are properties exhibited by one whole entity after it has been formed out of other entitities that now make up its internal componenents, in case those properties did not and do not pertain to those original entities, in se. And since one whole water molecule does not possessess 'wetness', but needs another molecule, of water or whatever, to generate the phenomenon, 'wetness' is just one more phenomenon generated by two or more whole entities reacting to each other, and is not an 'emergent property', as defined.\n\n I think your definition of emergence is too narrow. Emergence certainly includes multiple properties or processes that interact to form new ones synergistically, but I think it also extends to include additional complexity that arises from an increased frequency of what you already have. The key for me is that complexity increases to the point that you have something that you didn't have before, and which would not have been expected beforehand. Examples would be complex wind systems given lots of gas molecules, the ability of multiple air molecules to transmit sound, complex wirling patterns in schooling fish and flocking birds that result from simple \"follow your neighbor nine times out of ten\" rules, anthills resulting from \"move the gravel upward\" rules, and so forth. \n \n \n \nThis makes no sense. \"Laws\" are supposed to be 'hypotheses' that have been shown to be consistently and dependably accurate after being repeatedly tested by the scientific method. 'Hypotheses' are often wrong, 'theories' may be inaccuarate or insufficient, but \"laws\" are supposed to be tried, true, and universal, at least with only a few anomalous exceptions. \n You missed my point. I agree with what you just said - my point is that early biologists tended to propose things as laws when they were actually just proposing hypotheses. (Science needs a rule that no one who proposes something can can it a law or a theory.) They were really proposing hypotheses, so it's not surprising that a lot of the early ideas turned out to be wrong.\n \n \nIf this is not the case, if 'laws' do not really exist ... \n But some do. \n \n \n then how is reality to be considered knowable and rational? \n We do need principles and laws, but not all useful scientific knowledge needs to be summed up as \"laws\". That does not make biology unknowable and irrational.\n \n \n\n It is not helpful to propose an hypothesis but to call it a law when you propose it, which is what Haeckel and Dollo did.\n It isn't merely \"unhelpful\". It's either stupid, or in Haeckel's case, dishonest. I would suggest that much the same applies to calling an 'hypothesis', a 'theory'. Unless you wish to define 'theory' as meaning no more than, 'elaborate hypothesis'. But I was taught, back in the day, that a 'theory' was an hypothesis that had undergone at least preliminary testing by means of the scientific method, and had been validated to that extent.\n We are not in disagreement, and that's why I disapproved of such a practice. A theory should indeed have passed a bunch of validation, and most likely consists of much more than one hypothesis. (However, even scientists tend to misuse the word theory in part to bolster the apparent authority of their own favorite ideas..) \n \n \n It seems to me that a large proportion of scientific laws make statements about behaviors of systems but do not inherently offer explanations or cause and effect relationships.\n I think that they either state facts [which do not require explanations, but are essentially meaningless, per se], or they speak of causes, in which there is always reference to a 'force'.\n\n I disagree.\n \n Avogadro's Law (or Principle or Hypothesis) says that \"Equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of particles, or molecules.\" That's a fact without an explanation, but it's not useless and meaningless.\n \n Darcy's Law ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy%27s_Law ) is a very useful relationship that does not offer an explanation per se.\n \n \n\n 1) Natural selection can only work on characteristics that are beneficial to the individuals that possess the trait that is being selected.\n Wrong. Just the opposite is the reality here. From Darwin on, \"NS\" has been understood as subtractive, not additive. That is, \"NS\" has always meant a natural elimination of bioforms 'unfitted to their environment', not 'the generation of novel bioforms 'fitted to their environment'. That was why Darwin had to re-write Lamarck and Fisher had to invent 'random mutation' in order to account for what \"NS\" did not--i.e., \"characteristics that are beneficial to the individuals\" [i.e., enable it to overcome, to get past, 'selection']. \n\n Mutation, recombination, or drift provide the variation, and selection can then favor one end of the spectrum and disfavor the other. Positive selection in this sense is demonstrable and measurable. Selection can't generate a new feature from absolutely nothing, but once you have a little hint of the feature plus enough variation that there can be selective differences between the two ends of the spectrum, then positive selection is a real phenomenon and can drive the rest of the journey.",

   "Unlike chemists and physicists, biologists and geologists don't much talk about scientific \"laws\" (other than ones from chemistry and physics).\n\n Now, why is that, I wonder?!?\n\n \n \n\n In the 1800's, biologists were happy enough proposing \"laws\" (Hackel's biogenetic law, Dollo's law), but those mostly turned out to be wrong, or at minimum to need extensive codicils or whatever. Thus, we mostly stay away from the term (the Hardy-Weinberg law and, more recently, universal scaling laws, being exceptions).\n\n Now, why do they mostly turn out to be wrong, I wonder?!?\n\n \n I've been away and missed some of the fun, but here's a short answer: Because we can control the variables more precisely in chemistry and physics.\n \n For geology, take the \"law\" of superposition: strata must be older than strata upon which they lie. But this is not always true; inversions have happened. Is the law therefore completely useless? No; it's true most of the time. \n \n For an example more on topic, take the Mendel's law of independent assortment. Mendel concluded that genes are assorted independently... but this is only true when genes are on different chromosomes. I'm a tad rusty, but I think this is how it works: When two genes are on the same chromosome, the genes are not sorted independently. Does this inability to predict assortment probability as 1 in N turn all of Mendel's work on its head? Does it turn all of genetics on its head? Of course not. In fact, we've now determined degrees of linkage of such genes with map units, including mathematical models involving not only simple recombination but also \"crossing over\" twice. Our inability to specifically predict what will happen in any given instance in no way invalidates the model or our understanding of the process; at worst, one could say that our understanding is merely incomplete.\n \n In an ecological system, there's a lot going on, and treating our inability to infallibly predict all future biological events as some sort of fundamental flaw in our approach to biology is like throwing out the baby (and the wash basin, and table, and house, etc.) with the bathwater. Do you know what it takes to get biologically significant events simplified down to be able to truly predict every little thing that happens? Often, it requires working with mere molecules, which is when we make the transition to molecular biology, which is just biology-speak for biochemistry.",

   "**\n Tell that to the darwinist trolls who never have better to offer than personal attacks on me. \n\n \n This is why people complain about you, WW.

I have no interest in defending them.\n\n \n You didn't get them from a \"Darwinist\". There is no such thing. You got them from some unidentified person who knows nothing about evolutionary biology.\n \n I didn't ask you to defend them. I asked you to discuss them, so I could assess your understanding. You ignored me.\n \n \n**\n Well, I somehow missed the evidence and the reasoning. All I saw were statements of opinion, and no reason to even comment on them, let alone to\n argue against them. Nobody else saw any reason to respond to them, either, which I found disappointing. They were all too busy attacking me personally.\n\n \n Too bad. I was looking forward to a real discussion. But never mind.\n \n \n**\n Sorry. Guess I'm just not up on internet etiquette. \n\n \n That's true.\n \n \n**\n That is, you simply stated your opinion of them...\n Again, you simply stated your opinion...\n That's your opinion, again. And it flies in the face of fact.\n\n \n This is your opinion, backed up in the discussion by nothing whatsoever. And it flies in the face of fact. I cited evolution as a fact, not a theory. I have plenty of facts to back that up. Do you disagree that evolution happened?\n \n \n**\n You think that these statements [quoted below] are \"principles of evolution\"?!?!\n \n \"First, evolution is a fact, not a theory or a hypothesis. There is no other way to explain the evidence within the framework of nature. There were dinosaurs. There was a time when the Earth had no life on it, and then it did. All of the millions of known species use the same genetic machinery, and many genes are nearly identical in all cells, from bacteria to blue whales.\n \n Second, speciation through natural selection is one of the most successful theoretical ideas in the history of science. It is now buttressed by all that we know of molecular biology, including the entire machinery of DNA, RNA, protein coding, and so on.\n \n Third, the Bible is not a scientific treatise. The Jewish priests and prophets who wrote and compiled the books of the Bible had quite other purposes in mind. In fact, the idea of science didn't exist at the time.\"\n \n I do not. In fact, I have no idea why you injected a reference to the bible into the thread. Why in the world did you do that?\n\n \n Because there are Creationists watching.\n \n Yes, these are principles. I can be more explicit. \n \n Reliance on fact is a principle. Determining what are facts is not in any way a trivial enterprise, but we are tolerably good at it when we try. Evolution is a fact based on billions of more specific facts, such as the many billions of base pairs in the various sequenced DNA sets for different life forms.\n \n Looking for support for a theory (or refutation) in related disciplines is a principle. The theory of the inverse square force of gravity was advanced in astronomy, and then verified directly in Earthly labs to great precision, including the principle that gravity acts equally on all matter.\n \n The advance in the perihelion of Mercury turned out (since there was no planet Vulcan) to refute the inverse square \"Law\" of gravity, although it remains an excellent approximation for most purposes. The Michelson-Morley experiments refuted the luminiferous ether theory. Both of these discoveries led to new theories that had a wider range of application than Newtonian mechanics and Clerk-Maxwell electromagnetism: Special and General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. QM, as developed into the Standard Model, explains all of chemistry, including biochemistry, and most of physics, although we know that it is in fundamental contradiction to GR. They cannot both be absolutely true, although they can be and are accurate within certain realms to very high precision. The GPS system requires GR calculations of the rate of time for orbiting clocks. The rate of inspiralling of neutron star binaries is as predicted by GR, which gives us confidence that we will soon be able to detect gravity waves. The Standard Model permits calculation of primordial element abundances that agree with observation of intergalactic gas clouds. We have stellar and planetary evolution well in hand. \n \n And we have prebiotic and biological evolution well in hand, as well. Speciation through natural selection is a theory with extremely high explanatory power, amply confirmed by many other branches of science, as I stated.\n \n Bibliolatry is superstition. We actually agree on that, which is great. It is nevertheless an extremely important principle of science that religion cannot contradict nature. Galileo argued this point quite forcefully, and the Catholic Church which persecuted him over it has since admitted its error and even apologized.\n \n \n**\n Where in the world do you get off, assuming that you can label my opinions, \"prejudices\". Especially when you have not the slightest clue as to what my opinions are. Anyone who would attempt to link my thinking to fundamentalist bibliolatry obviously has no knowledge at all of the person he is attacking. The rest of this religious treatise is of no interest to me. Perhaps you should take some time to familiarize yourself with my ideas before presume to understand me.\n\n \n I can discuss prejudices that you reveal in discussion. A prejudice is an opinion formed without looking at the evidence, or in defiance of it. This is not an assumption on my part, and does not require permission. You are free to say if you think any of my ideas are prejudices. If you provide evidence, I will consider it.\n \n I have discussed laws and principles of science. You say that they do not qualify, and are nothing but opinion. I conclude that this opinion of yours is prejudice, since it would be easy for you to read the scientific source material where I got these ideas. You don't. You say you don't need to. You insult me. Where is your evidence that your opinions are not prejudice? What support do you offer? What support do you have?\n \n Do you accept the fact of evolution, that is, that species change over time, and new ones come into existence?\n \n The discussion of bibliolatry is entirely appropriate in a creo-evo debate, regardless of the opinions of an individual participant. Anti-Bibliolatry is a hard-won scientific principle, and the fight against it in religion continues. Galileo was given the second degree (taken to the torture chamber to be shown what they were thinking of using on him) before the trial in which he was sentenced to permanent house arrest. Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake.\n \n Where would I familiarize myself with your ideas? I have Googled for you and your ideas, and not found anything useful. All I saw was the apparent supposition by someone else that you are a Vitalist of some kind. All I see of your opinions in evidence in this discussion is dismissing the ideas of others, and insulting them personally. Why don't you tell us your Laws of Nature and your principles, so that we have some idea of what you think we should be talking about.\n \n I apologize for talking in ignorance about the state of your religious beliefs. What are they in fact? I am a Buddhist. Evolution is no skin off our noses. We even say that in matters of religion nobody should believe anything because somebody or some text says so. Not all Buddhists believe that, of course, but what can you do with superstitious fools?",
