   "Oh, wasn't familiar with Poe's Law, I see you already said that.\n\n \n I wasn't familiar with \"Poe's Law\" either. Here's what I found on it;\n \n Deleted from Wikipedia - Poe's law (deleted 15 May 2008 at 06:32 - Deletionpedia)\n \n \n It lasted 21 days on Wikipedia before being deleted, and it was originated by a Christianforums poster named \"Nathan Poe\". Doesn't really seem like that big of deal to me, but the atheist community seems to be increasingly fascinated with anything at all that allows them to mock Christianity. As this now famous genius \"Poe\" puts it;\n \n \nWithout a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is impossible to create a parody of Fundamentalism that SOMEONE won't mistake for the real thing.[1]\n\n \n So that's a problem of \"fundamentalism\", and not a problem with the one creating the \"parody\"? Apparently the creation of parodies for \"fundamentalism\" is a large part of atheism. emoticon_confused \n \n \nSpeaking of dellusion, I'm surprised some YEC didn't already post this in favor of their arguments. \n\n \n Let's have a look at it - a little pause button action, a little jotting down and we have it in writing! Atheist scientists (or Algore) provided me with this technology, not sure which. ;) <--- (one of those smileys Mr Poe enlightened me on) \n \n \n \nLately, it's been tough for us Christians. From Elton John to best-selling books, one of which calls God a \"delusion\",faith is under attack. Well, I have news for atheists, they're the ones who are deluded! Because God exists - He made the universe - I'm 100% sure of it. How do I know? From the Bible, \"In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. It says so right there on page one of the book God himself says he wrote. Checkmate! \n\n \n Not too bad so far, if we overlook the word arrangement of a 13 year old valley girl, spoken in the voice of a gay 21 year old college student. So far I'm fooled, but suspicious. Moving on;\n \n \nSorry atheists, scientists believe that the earth is billions of years old, because of something called radioactive decay. Well, the truth is, the earth is only about 6000 years old. God says so in the Bible. \n\n \n Uh oh, Mr. Poe's proclamation crashes and burns right there - the Bible says no such thing. This is where a \"satire\" quickly changes from something that starts out as mocking, (designed to be something that could be innocence) to a complete lie. It never takes long for atheist satirists to demonstrate their lack of knowledge of the Bible. Atheist mockers don't seem to be quite as skilled as Mr Poe would have us believe. \n \n \nNow, who should we believe, the creator of the universe, or some scientist freaks who don't even believe in God? Astronomers claim they can see galaxies so far away, their light must be even older than the earth for them to be visible. But the Bible proves that's impossible. When God created everything, he must have set the light from those galaxies already beaming towards the earth,j so that when he later gave us telescopes, we'd have more stuff to look at! Heh, heh, is God unbelievable or what? Now if you think that isn't the work of a conscious, omnipotent being whose son on earth was Jesus Christ, you must be deluded or something. \n\n \n Here, the atheist satirists assign perfection to \"astronomers\". They have no comprehension of God being above and beyond \"time\", and this causes them to feel that they're on the same level as God, able to question him and challenge him to the same extent he can question us and challenge us. Yet they know that there are characteristics of reality that they themselves cannot explain, though they probably seriously believe that astronomy is an exact, non-controversial science. \n \n \nAccording to atheists, fossils in the ground show that evolution, not intelligent design, produced all life on earth. That's ridiculous, the Bible clearly says God created man in his own image, though some deluded scientists also say you can see evolution happening in the mutations of drug resisting bacteria. Give me a break - God [inaudible mumbling] genes so that Christians can go to heaven, and that means we [George Bush/monkey visual] came from monkeys? \n\n \n The George Bush visual, the reference to heaven/monkeys was apparently used to emotionally cover the inadequacy of the \"fossils in the ground\", and \"mutations of drug resisting bacteria\" as complete explanations.\n \n \nIt's amazing how science can cure diseases, smash the atom, and create nuclear explosions, yet be so wrong about everything that's mentioned in the Holy Bible. \n\n \n Really no more amazing how science can cure some diseases, smash the atom, create nuclear explosions, yet screw up many other things that it attempts to do, often at great expense to the general public. Global warming hysteria comes to mind. \n \n \nI'm sure we'll find fossils of giants and unicorns one of these days. \n\n \n That would be more likely than finding evidence for abiogenesis. \n \n \nLook, I'm a Christian, and us Christians, we understand that things like miracles that defy the laws of physics are the truth. We will never question that, because we are 100% certain that God meant what he wrote. Scientists aren't certain about anything - all they have is a bunch of theories! (gravity) Clearly, stuff like science and reason have no place in our lives in the 21st century - we must live by the words of a very, very, old religious book. So that when the earth is consumed in fire at Armageddon, we'll physically ascend to paradise. And when I pray, the creator himself, and his son, born of a blessed virgin, come, and they speak to me, and they tell me I'm correct. So atheists, who exactly is the deluded one here? \n\n \n It's always interesting to see atheists making profound statements about billions of years, and mocking the Bible as being \"very, very old\". emoticon_confused Okay, enough about that - I'm now going to condense the various atheist explanations that have been presented to me at 4forums over the years. Is the following a parody, or is it the real thing? \n \n \nLately, it's been tough for us atheists. From recent scientific discoveries that show the amazing complexities of the simplest forms of life, the subsequent mathematical improbability of random, chance, godless processes producing and maintaining life, to people like Behe, Dembski, Spetner, and many websites untainted with liberalism and political correctness of the mainstream media, the movie \"Expelled\" that showed a very real probability of how we've been so close to violating the U.S. Constitution in academia. Well I have news for Christians/conservatives - they're the ones who are deluded! [insert stream of vulgar name calling here] Because God does not exist - random chance made the universe with all its order and complexity! How do I know this? From Madelyn Murray O'Hair! She said so, she proved how smart she was when she won her \"separation of church and state\" lawsuit in 1963! She has garnered so many followers that also happened to have an interest in science, that they've managed to take over the scientific community! How could they be wrong? How could their current representatives, Dawkins and Harris, be wrong? They obviously know all things! \n \n Now, who should we believe, the Bible, written and preserved over the entire period of the human ability to write, no matter how many attempts have been made to destroy it, or Dawkins and Harris and their millions of followers in the scientific community? It doesn't matter what the Bible says, Tiktaalik Roseaea is real! A small band of atheist explorers said so! We can look in telescopes and see all the galaxies we want! We know it took that light hundreds of billions of years to reach us! No God would have made the universe, and sat around that long waiting for us to be able to see it! Heh heh, is science unbelievable or what? Now, if you think we don't know how big those galaxies are, how many stars they contain, how many planets they contain that have life on them, how long it takes their light to get here (accurate to only a few hundred light years, plus or minus), you must be deluded or something! Just ask us, we'll tell you! \n \n According to Christians, orderly , specified complexity in life and the universe show a mathematical improbability very close to impossibility of random, purposeless origins and existence of reality. That's ridiculous - all you have to do is note that someone wins the lottery just about every week despite that individuals almost impossible chances - that tells you that evolution HAD to have happened! Dawkins and Harris clearly say that God does not exist, though some deluded non-atheist scientists say that chance can't fully explain evolution, let alone the origins of life. Dawkins has dreams that spacemen came long ago and sowed the seeds of life on earth then flew away, never to be seen again! How could he be wrong - he knows all things! \n \n It's amazing how the Bible can give us such obviously sound advise \n concerning finances, morality, behavior, as well as such accurate predictions about the breakdown of those things, and be so wrong about everything that science tells us about politics,and liberalism [Obama/Ried] visual here] and be so wrong about the age of the earth, or how long it takes light to reach us! I'm sure we'll find out life originated from lifeless matter someday, it's been just around the corner for 150 years now. Never mind that the corner keeps getting further and further away scientifically, we're going to find it really soon! \n \n Look, I'm an atheist, and us atheists, we understand that things like miracles that defy the laws of physics (the origin of life by natural processes) are the truth. We know there is no God, we will never question that, because we are 100% certain that Madelyn Murray O'Hair was right! Christians aren't certain about anything - they don't know how God originated, or where he is! They have no clue about all those galaxies like we do! Clearly, stuff like morals and finances, and written history have no place in our lives in the 21st century, we must live by the words of Dawkins and Harris - soon they will be able to cure ALL diseases, make us all live forever, and count more galaxies for us! So that when there is no more death or sorrow thanks to science, and people like Dawkins, Harris, and Obama are ruling over every aspect of our lives, they'll inform me that they're correct, and they'll have ways of seeing to it that I agree with them. Are Christians ever that logical? So Christians, who exactly is the deluded one here? \n\n \n I don't have the time nor the funding to put this in video form like Harris and Dawkins. I don't think many, if any, Christians really do - satire about atheism isn't a strong Christian practice, not nearly as strong as atheist satire about Christianity, it seems. Maybe that's what made Poe's Law so notable in the beginning of this thread.",

Especially those that were around before Christianity, and cannot therefore be accused of copying a successful format?\n\n \n A good question, and it's a good thing I'm not a politician (or even a talk radio host:p) or then I would have to do some dancing. I remember once when President George Bush referred to Islam as \"one of the world's great religions\" - I guess a U.S. President would have to do that, as the President of a country with no establishment of religion in its foundation. A Christian without speech police can refer to Islam in a more direct way - it's a false religion. \n \n Just about any follower of one certain religion is going to have disdain for any other religion, as well as atheism. Many atheists may think they have an advantage in that regard - they think they can group all religions together as being wrong in similar ways about their faith, and separate themselves from them. But since the term \"religion\" is so broad and vague, it's easy to see that atheists can't really do that so well, because there are a few religions that they can't have much disagreement with - \"Pantheism\", \"scientism\", would certainly be two, and there are probably more. Any religion that worships nature, with no defined god, isn't really at odds with atheism, is it?\n \n Your phrase within parenthesis, \"without the influence of God\", points out (to me) that discussions about God on these forums, and even throughout Christian study and discussion, are all too often about only his presence or absence, nothing more. There is something more, and that something is Satan, the \"great deceiver\", the \"evil one\". In Databed's hypothetical, where he said \"stuck them on a planet with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ\", my belief is that God/Christ would be there, (omnipresent) but I wasn't really consciously thinking about the possibility of the evil one NOT being there. I believe it's Satan's presence that causes atheism and it also causes false religions to be dreamed up. \n \n So to clarify my answer to his question, for people on another planet \"with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ\" would become a blend of atheism and false religion, since Satan is the author of both.

Do try to understand that you are reading a translation of a translation. \n\n \n Not quite, Einstein.\n \n It is true that, in the Septuagint version (the Greek translation of the Old Testament), the translation of Ex.3:14 is ego eimi ho on (\"I am the One who exists\").

The use of the divine \"being\" Name in Exodus chapter three (by our Lord Jesus in Christophany acting for the Father) served to put the Israelites on notice that this God is in no way comparable to the gods with which they were familiar (so neither is His Name comparable). In John 8:58 and elsewhere, Jesus makes it clear that He is that very same One, and anyone familiar with the meaning and the translations of that famous Hebrew passage should have recognized this. \n \n The meaning of Jesus' words, \"I am\" in John 8:58\n \n Besides, after Jesus said that the Jews tried to stone him for blasphemy.

   "Educating Pandion\n \n \nMaybe it would help you to understand better if you followed with your finger when your read. The treaty doesn't mention a theocracy.\n\n \n It doesn't need to. That's what a Christian government would probably be, so you struck out.\n \n \nYou see that? \"Not in any sense\" founded on christianity means that it wasn't founded on any sort of christian principles.\n\n \n Well that's horse drip anyway:\n \n Here are just some of the facts that are seldom taught in America&#8217;s public school classrooms:\n \n The most frequently recognized source for political inspiration for the founding fathers was the Bible, which was referenced in some 34% of the founding father&#8217;s quotations.\n \n The first reference to God as the foundation of an American colony was noted in the &#8216;Mayflower Compact,&#8217; dated November 11, 1620:\n \n &#8220;&#8230;.Having undertaken for the Glory of God, and advancement of\n the Christian faith, and the honour of our king and country, a\n voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia;\n Do by these presents, solemnly and mutually in the presence of\n God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together\n into a Civil Body&#8230;.&#8221;\n \n Many of the founding fathers recognized that the principles of civil law were inseparably linked to Biblical truths. James Wilson, one of the original Supreme Court Justices, and a signer of the Constitution, explained,\n \n &#8220;Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine&#8230;Far from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants&#8230;&#8221;\n \n Additionally, the United States Supreme Court specifically recognized America as a Christian nation. In the case &#8220;Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States&#8221; (Feb. 29, 1892, US457-458), Justice Josiah Brewer, following a lengthy and exhaustive search of early American historical literature, commented, &#8220;We find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth&#8230;.that we are a Christian nation&#8230;.&#8221;\n \n In another Supreme Court Case, &#8220;Zorach vs. Clauson&#8221; (1952, US306 307 313), Justice William O. Douglas categorically stated, &#8220;We are a religious people and our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.&#8221; Further, in &#8220;United States vs. Macintosh&#8221; (1931, 283 US 605, 625), Justice George Sutherland affirmed, &#8220;We are a Christian people&#8230;.affording to one another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledge with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God.&#8221;\n \n At the Constitutional Convention on June 28, 1787, Benjamin Franklin noted: &#8220;&#8230;The longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that &#8216;except the Lord build the House, they labor in vain that build it.&#8221;\n \n There are many today who believe Franklin was a strict deist, but Franklin here is not only referencing the Bible, but is alluding in part to a teaching by Jesus Christ from Matthew 10:29.\n \n Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution, John Quincy Adams noted, &#8220;The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity.&#8221;\n \n In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: &#8220;The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence were&#8230;the general principles of Christianity.&#8221;\n \n Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said, &#8220;The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ and His Apostles&#8230;This is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free constitutions of government.&#8221;\n \n Time after time, the founding fathers declared similar beliefs. From the archives of Patrick Henry&#8217;s personal notes (handwritten on the back of his copy of the &#8220;Stamp Act Resolutions,&#8221; made public after his death) we read:\n \n &#8220;Whether this (new government) will prove a blessing or a curse\n will depend upon the use our people make of the blessings which\n a gracious God hath bestowed on us. If they are wise they will be\n great and happy. If they are of a contrary character, they will be\n miserable. Righteousness alone can exalt them as a nation.&#8221;\n \n Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said:\n \n &#8220;Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have\n removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the\n people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.&#8221; (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)\n \n &#8220;I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we\n are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their\n native land and planted them in a country flowing with all\n the necessities and comforts of life.&#8221; (Monday, March 4,\n 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address)\n \n Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise.\n \n Speaking of Godly principles, Jefferson stated:\n \n &#8220;A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never\n seen; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian,\n that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus.&#8221;\n (Jan. 9, 1816 &#8211; In a letter to Charles Thomson)\n \n George Washington, the &#8220;Father of our Country,&#8221; likewise recognized God as supremely important in the American dream. In his first inaugural address on April 30, 1789, Washington remarked:\n \n &#8220;It would be improper to omit, in this first official act, my\n fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over\n the universe.&#8221;\n \n On Saturday, October 3, 1789, President Washington said this in proclaiming a day of national thanksgiving:\n \n &#8220;It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the Providence of\n Almighty God.&#8221;\n \n Today, our public schools are in a moral crisis. Washington once noted, &#8220;If you remove religious principles from the schools you are going to lose national morality.&#8221; How prophetic he was!\n \n Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the &#8220;Father of Public Schools,&#8221; once had this to offer: &#8220;The only foundation for a republic is&#8230;religion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty.&#8221;\n \n Don&#8217;t miss the significance of that last statement: &#8220;..without virtue there can be no liberty&#8230;.&#8221; The principle is clear &#8211; a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, &#8220;Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings).&#8221; The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions.\n \n Still another founding father, the Reverend John Witherspoon, mirrored Benjamin Rush when he declared, &#8220;&#8230;Civil liberty cannot long be preserved without virtue&#8230;.&#8221;\n \n And finally, let&#8217;s not forget James Madison, known as the &#8220;Chief Architect of U.S. Constitution,&#8221; who once had this to say:\n \n &#8220;Cursed be all that learning that is contrary to the Cross of Christ.&#8221;\n \n This is just a very short list of thousands of such examples that clearly speak of the Biblical and Christian foundations of our Founding Fathers and early America. Along with these there were the church services in government buildings up to and shortly after the civil war; paid chaplains, government authorized missionaries, reliefs of Moses and the Ten Commandments in the Supreme Court building, and so on and so forth. Whatever moral foundations apart from Christian and Biblical principles one may argue was second, was not even a close second. The record on that is clear.\n \n And so today, the debate over the moral foundations of America continues, but not in this quarter. America is in a moral and spiritual decline due to the ungodly secularization of this country. &#8220;Thou shalt not&#8221; has been replaced with, &#8220;If it feels good do it.&#8221; The wisdom of God has been replaced with the tenets of men; absolute truths replaced with moral relativism, and &#8220;Father God&#8221; has been replaced with &#8220;Mother Earth.&#8221; America is now paying the price for this ill-conceived venture. The remedy: A return to Godly values and principles, upon which this nation &#8220;of the people, by the people, and for the people,&#8221; was clearly founded. RighterReport.com\n \n You lose.",

   "Notice that Archy doesn't even try to point out where the founding fathers mentioned the christian principles, nor does he point out any of them.\n \n Neither does Easyrider. The best he can do is dicta from court cases from well after the founding of the nation. Nothing from the founding documents about a christian nation nor christian principles. But Easyrider does bring up the Mayflower Compact that did reflect christian principles in action. The government of Massachusetts under that document expelled, imprisoned, tortured and killed those who disagreed. That has always been characteristic of christianity.\n \n And then Easyrider tries to claim Jefferson as a christian. An unquestioned deist, and Easyrider doesn't know the difference. And then there is Patrick Henry who actually opposed the foundation of this country. For one thing, Henry wanted to tax everyone to support his church (christianity seems to need government support) and was defeated by Madison. Henry then fought to defeat the ratification of the Constitution - it was godless you know.\n \n So I ask again, where in the founding document (there is only one) are these christian principles mentioned? It amazes me how the Constitution went from universal opposition from christians (It was opposed from the pulpit by both Anglican and Congregationalist clergy, the two largest denominations) in 1797 to now being claimed as representative of christian ideals. It is even more stunning that these same christians who claim the Constitution as their own work so hard to undermine it in order to establish their religion as official, with official public displays, prayer in schools, religion taught as science, etc. It has to be a christian nation so that christians can impose their religion and go back to slavery and expelling, imprisoning, torturing and killing anyone who disagrees.

   "There seems to be no limit to the extremes to which fundamentalist Christians seem to be willing to go in efforts to demonstrate to the American people that it was the purpose of the founding fathers to found a Christian nation and thereby justify the imposition of fundamentalist religion on everyone by law. For example, opposition to the ratification of the Constitution was primarily for two reasons: one of those reasons was political, resting on the form of government and manner of representation; the other was religious, resting on whether the Constitution granted recognition to the \"Christian religion.\" Both in the chambers of the state legislatures and from the pulpits of churches, Christians worked to defeat the ratification of the new Constitution on the grounds that it did not acknowledge Christianity; that it was \"Godless.\" In the Virginia legislature it was a Christian, Patrick Henry, proudly claimed by fundamentalist Christians as one of the founding fathers, who led the opposition to the Constitution. And yet, fundamentalist Christians claim that the Constitution was inspired by Christian principles. If that were true, why would Christians have opposed the ratification of \"that Godless document?\"\n \n Consider the case of Thomas Jefferson. Even though Jefferson often expressed his disdain for Christianity and the Christian clergy, and often expressed his liberal, non-dogmatic religion, and even though fundamentalists do at times admit that Jefferson was not a Christian but a Deist or at best Unitarian, modern fundamentalists also frequently talk out of the other side of their mouths and attempt to rehabilitate Jefferson with claims that he was a Christian. Those claims are particularly strange since Jefferson's statement to Benjamin Rush, engraved on the Jefferson Memorial, \"for I have sworn upon the altar of god, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man,\" was a statement of his opinion of the Christian clergy when read in context. Note that the word \"god\" is not capitalized as is true of Jefferson's original manuscript. That would be typical of a deist. But Jefferson did have great respect for Jesus although he denied any divinity. Isn't it strange that in order to make their point fundamentalist Christians are willing to accept as Christian a man who thought that Jesus was nothing more than a good man. \n \n We have even seen claims that Benjamin Franklin, George Mason, James Madison and Benjamin Rush (friend of and consultant to Thomas Paine) were Christians. It seems that the only one to have been missed is Thomas Paine.\n \n Consider the fact that there is not a single, verified example of George Washington making any reference to Jesus Christ or even God in his private correspondence - strange for a man who Christians claim as one of them - is of no consequence to fundamentalist Christians. You can find many quotes on fundamentalist web sites put forward to prove that Washington was a Christian. All such examples are apparently inventions since Washington scholars repeatedly deny their veracity. One Christian apologist has even admitted making up quotes.\n \n During the Constitutional Convention itself, during discussion of Article VI, it was proposed and rejected that there be some religious test. As Luther Martin said, many delegates rejected the idea that \"it would be at least decent to hold out some distinction between the professors of Christianity and downright infidelity or paganism.\" (By the way, it seems that some modern Christians, lacking adequate command of their own language, have great difficulty with 18th century English. Mr. Martin's use of the word \"professors\" indicates men who declare openly that they are Christians. It has nothing to do with university teachers.)\n \n It should also be noted that Benjamin Franklin's motion to begin the sessions of the Constitutional Convention with a prayer was not passed. After Franklin's motion, there was a brief discussion and then the session was adjourned without moving a vote on the motion. It was never mentioned again. Thus, not a single session of the Constitutional Convention began with a prayer. It might also be noted that Franklin did not propose prayer to Jesus or even god. Franklin proposed prayer to implore the assistance of \"Heaven.\" Doesn't sound Christian to me - but it does ring of deism.",

   "Notice that Archy doesn't even try to point out where the founding fathers mentioned the christian principles, nor does he point out any of them. Neither does Easyrider.\n\n \n Pandion sweeps all the founding father quotes I quoted about the country being founded on Christian principles under the rug. Nice. Go back and read it again.\n \n \nAnd then Easyrider tries to claim Jefferson as a christian.\n\n \n That was Jefferson's quote that he was a Christian, not mine. That one went right over your head too. No wonder you're confused.\n \n \n (Jefferson was) An unquestioned deist, and Easyrider doesn't know the difference. \n\n \n You're the one who is confused, not me.\n \n A true deist was one who believed God created the universe and then sat back and (1) did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations and, (2) did not give (divine) revelation to man.\n \n In addition, one of the standard definitions of Deism, then and now, is this: \n \n Deism is defined in Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary, 1941, as: \"[From Latin Deus, God.Deity] The doctrine or creed of a Deist.\" And Deist is defined in the same dictionary as: \"One who believes in the existence of a God or supreme being but denies revealed religion, basing his belief on the light of nature and reason.\" \n \n Along these lines many would argue that, according to 18th century deism, God would not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. He was like the watchmaker who created / wound up the universe and then sat back and didn&#8217;t involve himself further. \n \n People who today try to classify Jefferson, Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and other founding fathers as strict &#8220;deists&#8221; have to contend with any number of quotations from these individuals, which to the contrary, show that they believed God did involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. \n \n Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said: \n \n \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have \n removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the\n people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.\" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)\n \n Now, why should Jefferson tremble for his country if God does not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations? Some Deist! LOL!!\n \n Ant then there's this:\n \n  \"I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we\n are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their\n native land and planted them in a country flowing with all\n the necessities and comforts of life.\" (Monday, March 4,\n 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address)\n \n Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise. \n \n Benjamin Franklin a deist? \n \n \"I've lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing Proofs I see of this Truth &#8212;That God governs in the Affairs of Men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his Notice, is it probable that an Empire can rise without his Aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that except the Lord build the House they labor in vain who build it. I firmly believe this, &#8212;and I also believe that without his concurring Aid, we shall succeed in this political Building no better than the Builders of Babel: We shall be divided by our little partial local interests; our Projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a Reproach and Bye word down to future Ages.\" Speech to the Constitutional Convention (June 28, 1787)\n \n In a pamphlet for Europeans titled Information to Those Who Would Remove to America, 1754, Benjamin Franklin wrote: \"Atheism is unknown there; Infidelity rare and secret; so that persons may live to a great age in that country without having their piety shocked by meeting with either an Atheist or an Infidel. And the Divine Being seems...pleased to favor the whole country.\" \n \n Religion of the Founding Fathers of America\n \n George Washington:\n \n He (Washington) was an open promoter of Christianity. For example, in his speech on May 12, 1779, he claimed that what children needed to learn &#8220;above all&#8221; was the &#8220;religion of Jesus Christ,&#8221; and that to learn this would make them &#8220;greater and happier than they already are&#8221;; on May 2, 1778, he charged his soldiers at Valley Forge that &#8220;To the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian&#8221;; and when he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the military on June 8, 1783, he reminded the nation that &#8220;without a humble imitation&#8221; of &#8220;the Divine Author of our blessed religion&#8221; we &#8220;can never hope to be a happy nation.&#8221; Washington's own adopted daughter declared of Washington that you might as well question his patriotism as to question his Christianity.\n \n In addition, the inscription on Washington's tomb at Mount Vernon is this:\n \n WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE REST THE REMAINS OF GENL. GEORGE WASHINGTON.\" Over the door of the inner tomb is inscribed: \"I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE.\"\n \n James Madison trained for ministry with the Rev. Dr. John Witherspoon, and Madison's writings are replete with declarations of his faith in God and in Christ. In fact, for proof of this, one only need read his letter to Attorney General Bradford wherein Madison laments that public officials are not bold enough about their Christian faith in public and that public officials should be &#8220;fervent advocates in the cause of Christ.&#8221; And while Madison did allude to a &#8220;wall of separation,&#8221; contemporary writers frequently refuse to allow Madison to provide his own definition of that &#8220;wall.&#8221; According to Madison, the purpose of that &#8220;wall&#8221; was only to prevent Congress from passing a national law to establish a national religion. \n \n There&#8217;s more in the following link on all this:\n \n http://www.wallbuilders.com/resources/search/detail.php?ResourceID=29\n \n In addition to what Archie already provided regarding Christian principles in the establishment of our laws, etc., I recommend you read:\n \n http://shop.1asecure.com/cart/prodpics/32906_d.jpg\n \n You really need to give up your secular revisionism.

Here, from the link:\n 4. The Charter of Massachusetts Bay (March 4, 1629). The Massachusetts charter was obtained at a time when the English government was undergoing an intense power struggle. In 1629, king Charles I dissolved the Parliament and began an eleven year reign of tyranny. Against this backdrop, the religious Nonconformists went to America to reclaim a godly form of civil government by establishing it anew in Massachusetts.\n \n The men of the company were Nonconformists, and their goal was to found a state based on the principles of the Bible and governed by the laws of God. [Perry, Sources at 77.]\n \n a. The principal purpose of colonization was to spread the Christian gospel. The lack of a Christian government gave rise to a presumption that the colonists had authority to establish a colony in Massachusetts.\n \n  . . . for the planting, ruling, ordering, and governing of New England in America . . . PROVIDED always, That the said Islands, or any the premises by the said Letterspatents intended and meant to be granted, were not then actually possessed or inhabited, by any other Christian Prince or State. [Opening \u00b6.]\n \n . . . whereby our said people, inhabitants there, may be so religiously, peaceably, and civilly governed, as their good life and orderly conversation, may win and incite the natives of country, to the knowledge and obedience of the only true God and Savior of mankind, and the Christian faith, which in our royal intention, and the adventurers free profession, is the principal end of this Plantation. [11th \u00b6.]\n \n b. The inhabitants of Massachusetts were guaranteed the privileges, immunities, and rights of Englishmen.\n \n That all and every the subjects of us, our heirs or successors . . . shall have and enjoy all liberties and immunities of free and natural subjects within any of the dominions of us, our heires or successors, to all intents, constructions, and purposes whatsoever, as if they and every of them were born within the Realm of England. [11th \u00b6.]\n The link has many more examples of what the original founders intended when traveling from England to settle in this new country.

   "More Bible/ Christianity and the Government:\n \n Bible and Government \n \n The Bible and Government - Faith Facts\n \n Judicial, legislative, and executive branches Constitution - Isaiah 33:22 \n \n For the LORD is our judge (Judicial Branch)\n the LORD is our lawgiver (Legislative Branch)\n the LORD is our king; (Executive Branch)\n \n All men are sinners - Constitutional checks and balances -  Gen. 8:21, Jer. 17:9, Mk. 7: 20-23, Rom. 3:23, 1 Jn 1:8 \n \n Sabbath day holy - \"Blue laws\" - Ex. 20:8 \n \n All men created equal - Declaration of Independence - Acts 10:34, 17:26, Gal. 3:28, 1 Pet. 2:17 \n \n Fair trial with witnesses - Sixth Amendment - Ex. 20:16, Dt. 19:15, Pr. 24:28, 25:18, Mat. 18:16 \n \n It has been said that America has never been a Christian nation, or that our founders were a bunch of atheists, agnostics, and deists. But consider the facts. At least 50 of the 55 framers of the U. S. Constitution were Christians (see M. E. Bradford...). Every single American president has taken his oath on the Bible and has referenced God in his inaugural address. Every one of the 50 state constitutions call on God for support. The Supreme Court, in 1892 after a an exhaustive 10-year study of the matter, said: \"This is a relgious people. This is a Christian nation.\" Even today, the Supreme Court opens each session with the verbal declaration, \"God save the United States of America.\" \n \n The first state constitution was the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut (1639). You may read this document at The University of Oklahoma College of Law: A Chronology of US Historical Documents: The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut. The framers of this document desired that every aspect of it be based on the Bible (See DeMar's book listed below, America's Christian History, pgs. 57-58). This document was a model for other constitutions including the U.S. Consitution which followed. The above table outlines the wide spread influence of biblical thought on America's legal system. \n \n What is the purpose of civil government, according to the Bible? The purpose of civil government is very simply to be God's servant to restrain evil and reward good (Romans 13:1-7; 1 Peter 2:13-14). Christians are (a) to pray for and obey governmental authority (1 Timothy 2:1-4), (b) unless it forbids what God requires or requires what God forbids, in which case Christians cannot submit, and some form of civil disobedience becomes inescapable (Acts 4:18-31, 5:17-29), (c) to influence government because all of life is under God's authority (Psalm 24:1; Psalm 83:18; Isaiah 42:8; Matthew 28:18-20; 2 Corinthians 10:5). In a participatory democracy, Christians are under obligation to participate in civil government (Matthew 22:21).",

   "Pandion sweeps all the founding father quotes I quoted about the country being founded on Christian principles under the rug.\n\n Your quotes are irrelevant to the question. Where did our christian founding fathers state in the founding documents that they were founding a christian nation. The only place I am aware that the topic came up was in the discussions of Article VI. After the discussion the article reads, \"no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\" This is certainly not a christian principle. Christians have always required that everyone agree with them, and they use imprisonment, torture, and execution to accomplish that. Always have. Why do you think that the Pilgrims left England? They wanted to establish a government where they were free to banish, imprison, torture, and execute anyone who had different beliefs. They were quite successful in doing so.\n \n Your remark about Jefferson is really off the wall. It shows the most fundamental ignorance of the topic.\n \n Some things that Thomas Jefferson said:\n \n \"Say nothing of my religion. It is known to my god and myself alone.\"\n \n \"I am of a sect by myself, as far as I know.\"\n \n \"What all agree upon is probably right; what no two agree in most probably is wrong.\"\n \n Jefferson was writing to Adams about religion in that last one.\n \n \"Millions of innocent men, women, and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, and imprisoned; yet we have not advanced one inch toward uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one-half the world fools and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over the earth.\"\n \n You asked, if Jefferson could be speaking from a deist standpoint when he said:\n \n \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have \n removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the\n people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.\" \n \n Clearly he was. He didn't mention christianity or Jesus. He did mention God. Quite typical of deism.\n \n And of course there is:\n \n \"I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life.\"\n \n Again, nothing about christianity or Jesus. I followed with my finger and moved my lips when I read but still didn't find it. The quote is pretty typical of deism.\n \n But this is all irrelevant. None if it either supports or denies the founding of a christian nation. That can only be supported by quoting the words in the founding document. Where does the constitution even mention god, Jesus, christianity? Where does it establish a christian nation?\n \n You guys keep babbling and yet you can't offer a shred of evidence (except what you imagine and invent.)",

   "The religious practices of this country were around a long time before godless atheists and others like Pandion tried to impose their revisionist standards and dogma on Americans. \n \n In the beginning of the American dream, the mention of God was welcome in the halls of government, in our schools, and in our courts of law. \n \n So before Mr. Pandion tries to tell you different, here's what was once lawful and appropriate in our nation's Capitol, and elsewhere: \n \n To start with: \"Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the House of Representatives. Madison followed Jefferson's example, although unlike Jefferson, who rode on horseback to church in the Capitol, Madison came in a coach and four. Worship services in the House--a practice that continued until after the Civil War--were acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary. Preachers of every Protestant denomination appeared. (Catholic priests began officiating in 1826.) As early as January 1806 a female evangelist, Dorothy Ripley, delivered a camp meeting-style exhortation in the House to Jefferson, Vice President Aaron Burr, and a \"crowded audience.\" Throughout his administration Jefferson permitted church services in executive branch buildings. The Gospel was also preached in the Supreme Court chambers.\" \n \n More in the following U.S. Library of Congress link: \n \n Religion and the Federal Government: PART 2 (Religion and the Founding of the American Republic, Library of Congress Exhibition) \n \n The Danbury Baptist Letter, as Originally Drafted\n \n The Library of Congress is grateful to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory for recovering the lines obliterated from the Danbury Baptist letter by Thomas Jefferson. He originally wrote \"a wall of eternal separation between church and state,\" later deleting the word \"eternal.\" He also deleted the phrase \"the duties of my station, which are merely temporal.\" Jefferson must have been unhappy with the uncompromising tone of both of these phrases, especially in view of the implications of his decision, two days later, to begin attending church services in the House of Representatives.\n \n Reserved Seats at Capitol Services\n \n Here is a description, by an early Washington \"insider,\" Margaret Bayard Smith (1778-1844), a writer and social critic and wife of Samuel Harrison Smith, publisher of the National Intelligencer, of Jefferson's attendance at church services in the House of Representatives: \"Jefferson during his whole administration was a most regular attendant. The seat he chose the first day sabbath, and the adjoining one, which his private secretary occupied, were ever afterwards by the courtesy of the congregation, left for him.\"\n \n The Old House of Representatives\n \n Church services were held in what is now called Statuary Hall from 1807 to 1857. The first services in the Capitol, held when the government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, were conducted in the \"hall\" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the \"Oven,\" which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Services were conducted in the House until after the Civil War. The Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. \n \n A Millennialist Sermon Preached in Congress\n \n This sermon on the millennium was preached by the Baltimore Swedenborgian minister, John Hargrove (1750-1839) in the House of Representatives. One of the earliest millennialist sermons preached before Congress was offered on July 4, 1801, by the Reverend David Austin (1759-1831), who at the time considered himself \"struck in prophesy under the style of the Joshua of the American Temple.\" Having proclaimed to his Congressional audience the imminence of the Second Coming of Christ, Austin took up a collection on the floor of the House to support services at \"Lady Washington's Chapel\" in a nearby hotel where he was teaching that \"the seed of the Millennial estate is found in the backbone of the American Revolution.\"\n \n First Catholic Sermon in the House\n \n On January 8, 1826, Bishop John England (1786-1842) of Charleston, South Carolina, became the first Catholic clergyman to preach in the House of Representatives. The overflow audience included President John Quincy Adams, whose July 4, 1821, speech England rebutted in his sermon. \n \n Woman Preacher in the House (and call for revival!)\n \n In 1827, Harriet Livermore (1788-1868), the daughter and granddaughter of Congressmen, became the second woman to preach in the House of Representatives. The first woman to preach before the House (and probably the first woman to speak officially in Congress under any circumstances) was the English evangelist, Dorothy Ripley (1767-1832), who conducted a service on January 12, 1806. Jefferson and Vice President Aaron Burr were among those in a \"crowded audience.\" Sizing up the congregation, Ripley concluded that \"very few\" had been born again and broke into an urgent, camp meeting style exhortation, insisting that \"Christ's Body was the Bread of Life and His Blood the drink of the righteous.\"\n \n Communion Service in the Treasury Building\n \n Manasseh Cutler here describes a four-hour communion service in the Treasury Building, conducted by a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend James Laurie: \"Attended worship at the Treasury.

Three tables; service very solemn; nearly four hours.\" \n \n Adams's Description of a Church Service in the Supreme Court\n \n John Quincy Adams here describes the Reverend James Laurie, pastor of a Presbyterian Church that had settled into the Treasury Building, preaching to an overflow audience in the Supreme Court Chamber, which in 1806 was located on the ground floor of the Capitol. \n \n The Old Supreme Court Chamber\n \n Description of church services in the Supreme Court chamber by Manasseh Cutler (1804) and John Quincy Adams (1806) indicate that services were held in the Court soon after the government moved to Washington in 1800.\n \n Church Services in Congress after the Civil War\n \n Charles Boynton (1806-1883) was in 1867 chaplain of the House of Representatives and organizing pastor of the First Congregational Church in Washington, which was trying at that time to build its own sanctuary. In the meantime the church, as Boynton informed potential donors, was holding services \"at the Hall of Representatives\" where \"the audience is the largest in town. . . .nearly 2000 assembled every Sabbath\" for services, making the congregation in the House the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience then in the United States.\" The First Congregational Church met in the House from 1865 to 1868. \n \n House of Representatives, After the Civil War\n \n The House moved to its current location on the south side of the Capitol in 1857.

   "And the christian nation weenies still can't point to a single place in the Constitution that is based on so called christian values. I did better. I point out two places that were based on the christian tolerance for slavery.\n \n The best they have done is to quote someone mentioning god and claiming that it doesn't sound like deism to them. I wonder if they actually have any idea of the nature of deism in the US in the late 1700s.\n \n Funny how they cite \"all men are created equal\" without even noticing what preceded that statement. First of all, it is the \"Laws of Nature and Nature's God\" that entitle them to independence. This is a phrase that is quite typical of deism. The deist god created nature and nature governed the earth without god. Further, it is \"a decent respect to the opinions of mankind\" that impel them to declare the reasons. It isn't a respect for jesus or god.\n \n Following that the D of I says that \"We hold these truths to be self evident; that all men are created equal.\" How is it that this is somehow a tenet of christianity if it is self evident rather than revealed by christian scripture? Actually, if the christian nation people bothered to educate themselves they would know that self evident truth, equality of all, as well as \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" are taken from previous writing by humanistic deists. By the way, it was \"life, liberty and property\" in the original by Locke (definitely not a christian - in fact, scorned by christians). Jefferson just wanted to dress it up because he didn't feel that everyone had a right to property - only the intelligentsia, he among them.\n \n And when the Constitution was written and placed before the people of the United States for ratification, it was the christians who opposed ratification. Christian clergy preached against the Constitution from the pulpit and christian legislators harangued against it in state legislatures. Christians opposed the Constitution because it was \"godless,\" not based on christian principles. The Constitution granted no special status to christianity or christian principles. It states specifically that no religious test is required for any office under the Constitution.\n \n So again I ask the christian nation weenies, where in the Constitution (the founding document of our nation) are these christian principles mentioned? Where does that document mention either jesus or god? Further, as T.Q. and Penfold add, what specifically are these principles that are specific to christianity alone and not civilization in general?\n \n And my other questions have also gone unanswered. I guess our christian nation weenies can't answer. How many times is god mentioned in the Constitution? How many times is jesus mentioned in the Constitution? How many times is religion mentioned in the Constitution? Funny how they don't know.\n \n On a side note, isn't it peculiar how it is claimed that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is based on some christian principle, when, in fact, christians have never been shy about taking away all three from anyone who disagreed. Look at the history of any christian country and you will see that it is true. England even fought wars about the correct form of christianity.\n \n On the other hand, christian fundamentalists have bee trying for years to impose their religion through government. They want religious displays (their religion) on government property. They want prayer in public schools (their prayers imposed on my children). And they want to replace science (physics, earth science, astronomy, and biology) with their religious mythology.",

   "We know that Easy and Archy are trying to cherry pick answers from creationists sites that seem to them to solve their problem about the founding of a Christian nation. Here are some of the quotes provided by Easy and the principles that he thinks they support. Easy thought he and actually offered something relevant to the question when he cited these and seemed pretty upset when they were ignored. I hope this calms him down.\n \n Easy says: Judicial, legislative, and executive branches Constitution\n and cites Isa 33:22\n For the LORD [is] our judge, the LORD [is] our lawgiver, the LORD [is] our king; he will save us.\n Easy doesn't explain how it is that a single mythical being represents all inspires three branches of government.\n \n Easy says: All men are sinners - Constitutional checks and balances\n And cites Gen 8:21, Jer 17:9, Mk 7: 20-23, Rom 3:23, 1 Jn 1:8\n  And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart [is] evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.The heart [is] deceitful above all [things], and desperately wicked: who can know it? And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\n Easy doesn't tell us how any of that relates to constitutional checks and balances, which have nothing to do with sin. Isn't it amazing how twisted the christian mind can get?\n \n Easy says: Sabbath day holy - \"Blue laws\"\n And cites Ex. 20:8\n Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\n Easy doesn't tell us where in the Constitution we can read the article that has to do with blue laws. Those laws are, as far as I know, local in nature and not in effect everywhere in this \"nation.\" How is that Biblical trash relevant?\n \n Easy says: All men created equal - Declaration of Independence\n And cites Acts 10:34, 17:26, Gal. 3:28, 1 Pet. 2:17\n Then Peter opened [his] mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus,Honour all [men]. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.\n Again, Easy doesn't explain why any of that indicates a Christian principle about the equality of all men. Certainly a king is not equal to the subjects. Historically, christians recognized several classes of non-equal people - royalty, nobility, freemen, and serfs and slaves. They were not equal. Three more important facts: First, at the time the Constitution was written, many Christians supported slavery. Slavery was explicitly allowed by the constitution because of the insistence of Southern Christians. Second, the D of I isn't a founding document. It was a statement as to the causes for the separation. Third, the concept of equality is drawn from the writings of humanistic deists of the enlightenment. Christians were generally not in favor of the idea. We're not talking about today when Christians have claimed those ideas for themselves. The fact is that they are not drawn from Christianity but from the ideas of men who opposed Christianity.\n \n Easy says: Fair trial with witnesses - Sixth Amendment\n And cites: Ex. 20:16, Dt. 19:15, Pr. 24:28, 25:18, Mat. 18:16\n Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.\"One witness shall not rise against a man concerning any iniquity or any sin that he commits; by the mouth of two or three witnesses the matter shall be established.Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, For would you deceive with your lips?A man who bears false witness against his neighbor [Is like] a club, a sword, and a sharp arrow.But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that 'by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. \n Does anyone else find it strange that none of these quotes have anything to do with a court trial? The VI Amendment states: \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district where in the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\" How exactly does the Hebrew prohibition against false witness, commendable as it might be, apply?\n \n The lengths to which the Christian nation bunch is willing to go is remarkable. It doesn't matter what the Bible says, they cherry pick quotes out of context to justify imposing their religion on everyone. It doesn't matter where the ideas actually came from; the Christian nation bunch now claims them as their own, some 200 years after they opposed those very same ideas from pulpits and in state legislatures as the fought against the ratification of the \"godless Constitution.\"\n \n As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't matter to me very much. I have studied the Constitution and have formed my own opinions. Mostly I agree with the way it has been interpreted by the Supreme Court. But it does matter to the Christian nation fanatics. Unless it was the intention of the founding fathers to impose Christianity on everyone, their efforts to use the government to impose their religion on everyone are fruitless. They can't put their xmas displays on public buildings, they can't make children pray in school, and they can't teach their religion as science. As a matter of fact, the Constitution also protects children from being required to recite the Pledge of Allegiance who oppose it for religious reasons.",

   "Still waiting for you to respond to my entirely substantive post, mainly the fact that your \"witness\" explicitly says that she witnessed nothing about his faith.\n\n \n You're dreaming. Nelly wrote:\n \n Woodlawn, 26 February, 1833.\n \n Sir,\n I received your favor of the 20th instant last evening, and hasten to give you the information, which you desire.\n \n Truro [Episcopal] Parish is the one in which Mount Vernon, Pohick Church [the church where George Washington served as a vestryman], and Woodlawn [the home of Nelly and Lawrence Lewis] are situated. Fairfax Parish is now Alexandria. Before the Federal District was ceded to Congress, Alexandria was in Fairfax County. General Washington had a pew in Pohick Church, and one in Christ Church at Alexandria. He was very instrumental in establishing Pohick Church, and I believe subscribed [supported and contributed to] largely. His pew was near the pulpit. I have a perfect recollection of being there, before his election to the presidency, with him and my grandmother. It was a beautiful church, and had a large, respectable, and wealthy congregation, who were regular attendants.\n \n He attended the church at Alexandria when the weather and roads permitted a ride of ten miles [a one-way journey of 2-3 hours by horse or carriage]. In New York and Philadelphia he never omitted attendance at church in the morning, unless detained by indisposition [sickness]. The afternoon was spent in his own room at home; the evening with his family, and without company. Sometimes an old and intimate friend called to see us for an hour or two; but visiting and visitors were prohibited for that day [Sunday]. No one in church attended to the services with more reverential respect. My grandmother, who was eminently pious, never deviated from her early habits. She always knelt. The General, as was then the custom, stood during the devotional parts of the service. On communion Sundays, he left the church with me, after the blessing, and returned home, and we sent the carriage back for my grandmother.\n \n It was his custom to retire to his library at nine or ten o'clock where he remained an hour before he went to his chamber. He always rose before the sun and remained in his library until called to breakfast. I never witnessed his private devotions. I never inquired about them. I should have thought it the greatest heresy to doubt his firm belief in Christianity. His life, his writings, prove that he was a Christian. He was not one of those who act or pray, \"that they may be seen of men\" [Matthew 6:5]. He communed with his God in secret [Matthew 6:6]. \n \n My mother [Eleanor Calvert-Lewis] resided two years at Mount Vernon after her marriage [in 1774] with John Parke Custis, the only son of Mrs. Washington. I have heard her say that General Washington always received the sacrament with my grandmother before the revolution. When my aunt, Miss Custis [Martha's daughter] died suddenly at Mount Vernon, before they could realize the event [before they understood she was dead], he [General Washington] knelt by her and prayed most fervently, most affectingly, for her recovery. Of this I was assured by Judge [Bushrod] Washington's mother and other witnesses. \n \n He was a silent, thoughtful man. He spoke little generally; never of himself. I never heard him relate a single act of his life during the war. I have often seen him perfectly abstracted, his lips moving, but no sound was perceptible. I have sometimes made him laugh most heartily from sympathy with my joyous and extravagant spirits. I was, probably, one of the last persons on earth to whom he would have addressed serious conversation, particularly when he knew that I had the most perfect model of female excellence [Martha Washington] ever with me as my monitress, who acted the part of a tender and devoted parent, loving me as only a mother can love, and never extenuating [tolerating] or approving in me what she disapproved of others. She never omitted her private devotions, or her public duties; and she and her husband were so perfectly united and happy that he must have been a Christian. She had no doubts, no fears for him. After forty years of devoted affection and uninterrupted happiness, she resigned him without a murmur into the arms of his Savior and his God, with the assured hope of his eternal felicity [happiness in Heaven]. Is it necessary that any one should certify, \"General Washington avowed himself to me a believer in Christianity?\" As well may we question his patriotism, his heroic, disinterested devotion to his country. His mottos were, \"Deeds, not Words\"; and, \"For God and my Country.\"\n \n With sentiments of esteem,\n I am, Nelly Custis-Lewis\n \n Do deists and/or infidels take the Christian sacrament of the body of Christ, Electrolyte, as Washington did??

   "Do deists and/or infidels take the Christian sacrament of the body of Christ, Electrolyte, as Washington did?? Pappillion?? \n\n The letter is a fraud. Washington was never known to be a communicant in the Anglican church. Washington would leave just before the communion service. One of his pastors commented on that fact from the pulpit and as a result, Washington stopped going to church on Sundays when there was a communion service. From his diary it has been calculated that Washington attended church an average of 6 times a year. In one year he actually attended 14 times. One of the quotes below is from George Custis (Martha's grandson and brother of Nellie) that he went home with Washington and they sent the carriage back for Martha because she had stayed for the communion service.\n \n In the spirit of fundamentalist christians, I too will spam the board with quotes. Except mine are from sources that can be verified.\n \n \"Dr. Rush told me (he had it from Asa Green) that when the clergy addressed General Washington, on his departure from the government, it was observed in their consultation that he had never, on any occasion, said a word to the public which showed a belief in the Christian religion, and they thought they should so pen their address as to force him at length to disclose publicly whether he was a Christian or not. However, he observed, the old fox was too cunning for them. He answered every article of their address particularly, except that, which he passed over without notice.\"\n -- Thomas Jefferson, quoted from Jefferson's Works, Vol. iv., p. 572. (Asa Green \"was probably the Reverend Ashbel Green, who was chaplain to congress during Washington's administration.\" -- Farrell Till in \"The Christian Nation Myth.\")\n \n \"[Washington was] a total stranger to religious prejudices, which have so often excited Christians of one denomination to cut the throats of those of another.\"\n -- John Bell, in 1779, in Paul F Boller, George Washington & Religion, Dallas: Southern Methodist University Press, 1963, p. 118, quoted from Ed and Michael Buckner, \"Quotations that Support the Separation of State and Church\"\n \n \"I know that Gouverneur Morris, who claimed to be in his secrets, and believed himself to be so, has often told me that General Washington believed no more in that system [Christianity] than he did.\"\n -- Thomas Jefferson, in his private journal, February, 1800, quoted from Jefferson's Works, Vol. iv., p. 572 (\"Gouverneur Morris was the principal drafter of the Constitution of the United States; he was a member of the Continental Congress, a United States senator from New York, and minister to France. He accepted, to a considerable extent, the skeptical views of French Freethinkers.\" -- John E Remsberg, Six Historic Americans.)\n \n \"I never witnessed his private devotions. I never inquired about them.\"\n -- Eleanor \"Nellie\" Parke Custis Lewis, Martha Washington's granddaughter from a previous marriage, quoted from Sparks' Washingon, also from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, p. 22\n \n \"Sir, Washington was a Deist.\"\n -- The Reverend Doctor James Abercrombie, rector of the church Washington had attended with his wife, to The Reverend Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, New York, upon Wilson's having inquired of Abercrombie regarding Washington's religious beliefs, quoted from John E Remsberg, Six Historic Americans\n \n \"The pictures that represent him on his knees in the winter forest at Valley Forge are even silly caricatures. Washington was at least not sentimental, and he had nothing about him of the Pharisee that displays his religion at street corners or out in the woods in the sight of observers, or where his portrait could be taken by 'our special artist'!\"\n -- The Reverend M J Savage, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, p. 22\n \n \"There was a clergyman at this dinner who blessed the food and said grace after they had done eating and had brought in the wine. I was told that General Washington said grace when there was no clergyman at the table, as fathers of a family do in America. The first time that I dined with him there was no clergyman and I did not perceive that he made this prayer, yet I remember that on taking his place at the table, he made a gesture and said a word, which I took for a piece of politeness, and which was perhaps a religious action. In this case his prayer must have been short; the clergyman made use of more forms. We remained a very long time at the table. They drank 12 or 15 healths with Madeira wine. In the course of the meal beer was served and grum, rum mixed with water.\"\n -- Commissary-General Claude Blanchard, writing in his journal, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, p. 23\n \n \"With respect to the inquiry you make, I can only state the following facts: that as pastor of the Episcopal Church, observing that, on sacramental Sundays George Washington, immediately after the desk and pulpit services, went out with the greater part of the congregation -- always leaving Mrs. Washington with the other communicants -- she invariably being one -- I considered it my duty, in a sermon on public worship, to state the unhappy tendency of example, particularly of those in elevated stations, who uniformly turned their backs on the Lord's Supper. I acknowledge the remark was intended for the President; and as such he received it. A few days after, in conversation, I believe, with a Senator of the United States, he told me he had dined the day before with the President, who, in the course of conversation at the table, said that, on the previous Sunday, he had received a very just rebuke from the pulpit for always leaving the church before the administration of the sacrament; that he honored the preacher for his integrity and candor; that he had never sufficiently considered the influence of his example, and that he would not again give cause for the repetition of the reproof; and that, as he had never been a communicant, were he to become one then, it would be imputed to an ostentatious display of religious zeal, arising altogether from his elevated station. Accordingly, he never afterwards came on the morning of sacrament Sunday, though at other times he was a constant attendant in the morning.\"\n -- The Reverend Doctor James Abercrombie, in a letter to a friend in 1833, Sprague's Annals of the American Pulpit, vol. 5, p. 394, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, pp. 25-26\n \n \"When Congress sat in Philadelphia, President Washington attended the Episcopal Church. The rector, Dr. Abercrombie, told me that on the days when the sacrament of the Lord's Supper was to be administered, Washington's custom was to arise just before the ceremony commenced, and walk out of the church. This became a subject of remark in the congregation, as setting a bad example. At length the Doctor undertook to speak of it, with a direct allusion to the President. Washington was heard afterwards to remark that this was the first time a clergyman had thus preached to him, and he should henceforth neither trouble the Doctor or his congregation on such occasions, and ever after that, upon communion days, 'he absented himself altogether from church.'\"\n -- The Reverend Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, New York, biographer of Bishop White, in his sermon on the \"Religion of the Presidents,\" published in the Albany Daily Advertiser, in 1831, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, pp. 26\n \n \"I have diligently perused every line that Washington ever gave to the public, and I do not find one expression in which he pledges, himself as a believer in Christianity. I think anyone who will candidly do as I have done, will come to the conclusion that he was a Deist and nothing more.\"\n -- The Reverend Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, New York, in an interview with Mr. Robert Dale Owen written on November 13, 1831, which was publlshed in New York two weeks later, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, pp. 27\n \n \"I called last evening on Dr. Wilson, as I told you I should, and I have seldom derived more pleasure from a short interview with anyone. Unless my discernment of character has been grievously at fault, I met an honest man and a sincere Christian. But you shall have the particulars. A gentleman of this city accompanied me to the Doctor's residence. We were very courteously received. I found him a tall, commanding figure, with a countenance of much benevolence, and a brow indicative of deep thought, apparently 50 years of age. I opened the interview by stating that though personally a stranger to him, I had taken the liberty of calling in consequence of having perused an interesting sermon of his, which had been reported in the Daily Advertiser of this city, and regarding which, as he probably knew, a variety of opinions prevailed. In a discussion, in which I had taken part, some of the facts as there reported had been questioned; and I wished to know from him whether the reporter had fairly given his words or not. I then read to him from a copy of the Daily Advertiser the paragraph which regards Washington, beginning, 'Washington was a man,' etc., and ending 'absented himself altogether from church.' 'I endorse,' said Dr. Wilson with emphasis, 'every word of that. Nay, I do not wish to conceal from you any part of the truth, even what I have not given to the public. Dr. Abercrombie said more than I have repeated. At the close of our conversation on the subject his emphatic expression was -- for I well remember the very words \"Sir, Washington was a Deist.\"'\"\n -- Mr. Robert Dale Owen, newspaper reporter, afterwards a member of Congress and later Minister to Naples, after interviewing Dr. Wilson, giving the substance of the interview in a letter written on November 13, 1831, which was published in New York two weeks later, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, pp. 26-27\n \n \"In regard to the subject of your inquiry, truth requires me to say that General Washington never received the communion in the churches of which I am the parochial minister. Mrs. Washington was an habitual communicant. I have been written to by many on that point, and have been obliged to answer them am as I now do you.\"\n -- The Right Reverend William White, the first bishop of Pennsylvania, friend of Washington and bishop of Christ's Church in Philadelphia, which Washington attend for about 25 years when he happened to be in that city, in a letter to Colonel Mercer of Fredericksberg, Virginia, on August 15, 1835, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, pp. 27\n \n \"Though the General attended the churches in which Dr. White officiated, whenever he was in Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War, and afterwards while President of the United States, he was never a communicant in them.\"\n -- The Reverend Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, New York, from Wilson, Memoir of Bishop White, p. 188, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, pp. 27\n \n \"His behavior in church was always serious and attentive, but as your letter seems to intend an inquiry on the point of kneeling during the service, I owe it to the truth to declare that I never saw him in the said attitude.... Although I was often in the company of this great man, and had the honor of often dining at his table, I never heard anything from him which could manifest his opinions on the subject of religion.... Within a few days of his leaving the Presidential chair, our vestry waited on him with an address prepared and delivered by me. In his answer he was pleased to express himself gratified by what he had heard from our pulpit; but there was nothing that committed him relatively to religious theory.\"\n -- The Reverend Doctor Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, New York, in a letter to the Rev B C C Parker, dated November 28, 1832, from Wilson, Memoir of Bishop White, pp. 189-191, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, pp. 27\n \n \"I do not believe that any degree of recollection will bring to my mind any fact which would prove General Washington to have been a believer in the Christian revelation further than as may be hoped from his constant attendance upon Christian worship, in connection with the general reserve of his character.\"\n -- The Reverend Doctor Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, New York, in a letter to the Rev B C C Parker, dated December 31, 1832, from Wilson, Memoir of Bishop White, pp. 189-191, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, pp. 28\n \n \"I find no one who ever communed with him.\"\n -- Rev William Jackson, rector of Alexandria, Virginia, in response to a letter from Reverend Origen Bacheler, cited in The Bacheler-Owen Debate, vol. 2, p. 262, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, pp. 28\n \n \"I am sorry, after so long a delay in replying to your last, that it is not in my power to communicate something definite in reference to General Washington's church membership.... Nor can I find any old person who ever communed with him.\"\n -- Rev William Jackson, rector of Alexandria, Virginia, in response to a second appeal from Reverend Origen Bacheler, cited in The Bacheler-Owen Debate, vol. 2, p. 262, quoted in John E Remsburg's Six Historic Americans, pp. 110-111, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, pp. 28\n \n \"On communion Sundays, he left the church with me after the blessing, and returned home, and we sent the carriage back after my grandmother.\"\n -- George Custis, letter to Mr. Sparks on February 26, 1833, in Sparks's Washington, p. 521, quoted from Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents, pp. 29\n \n \"Unlike Thomas Jefferson -- and Thomas Paine, for that matter -- Washington never even got around to recording his belief that Christ was a great ethical teacher. His reticence on the subject was truly remarkable. Washington frequently alluded to Providence in his private correspondence. But the name of Christ, in any correspondence whatsoever, does not appear anywhere in his many letters to friends and associates throughout his life.\"\n -- Paul F Boller, George Washington & Religion (1963) pp. 74-75, quoted from Ed and Michael Buckner, \"Quotations that Support the Separation of State and Church.\" Had Washington been a pious Christian, he would have at least mentioned the name of Christ!\n \n \"That he was not just striking a popular attitude as a politician is revealed by the absence of of the usual Christian terms: he did not mention Christ or even use the word 'God.' Following the phraseology of the philosophical Deism he professed, he referred to 'the invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men,' to 'the benign parent of the human race.'\"\n -- James Thomas Flexner, describing Washington's first Inaugural Address, in George Washington and the New Nation (1783-1793) (1970) p. 184, quoted from Ed and Michael Buckner, \"Quotations that Support the Separation of State and Church\"\n \n \"Washington's religious belief was that of the enlightenment: deism. He practically never used the word 'God,' preferring the more impersonal word 'Providence.' How little he visualized Providence in personal form is shown by the fact that he interchangeably applied to that force all three possible pronouns: he, she, and it.\"\n -- James Thomas Flexner, in George Washington: Anguish and Farewell (1793-1799) (1972) p. 490, quoted from Ed and Michael Buckner, \"Quotations that Support the Separation of State and Church\"\n \n \"The founders of our nation were nearly all Infidels, and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected [Washington; Adams; Jefferson; Madison; Monroe; Adams; Jackson] not a one had professed a belief in Christianity....\n \"Among all our presidents from Washington downward, not one was a professor of religion, at least not of more than Unitarianism.\"\n -- The Reverend Doctor Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, New York, in a sermon preached in October, 1831, first sentence quoted in John E Remsberg, Six Historic Americans, second sentence quoted in Paul F Boller, George Washington & Religion, pp. 14-15\n \n \"George Washington's conduct convinced most Americans that he was a good Christian, but those possessing first-hand knowledge of his religious convictions had reasons for doubt.\"\n -- Barry Schwartz, George Washington: The Making of an American Symbol (1987) p. 170, quoted from Ed and Michael Buckner, \"Quotations that Support the Separation of State and Church\"\n \n \"No citizens ... were more sensitive to Washington's role as an upholder of liberties than the religious minorities. These groups were less anxious to cultivate what they had in common with other Americans than to sustain what kept them apart. Washington recognized this, just as he recognized the tenacity of regional and economic interests, and he took pains to explain precisely what national unity meant to him. He carried to his countrymen a vision of \"organic\" rather than \"mechanical\" solidarity, a union based on difference and interdependence rather than uniformity of belief and conduct. Washington's understanding of the kind of integration appropriate to a modern state was not shared by the most powerful Protestant establishments, the New England Congregationalists and Presbyterians; but other religious groups could not have been more pleased.... Acknowledging in each instance that respect for diversity was a fair price for commitment to the nation and its regime, Washington abolished deep-rooted fears that would have otherwise alienated a large part of the population from the nation-building process. For this large minority, he embodied not the ideal of union, nor even that of liberty, but rather the reconciliation of union and liberty.\"\n -- Barry Schwartz, George Washington: The Making of an American Symbol (1987) pp. 85-86, quoted from Ed and Michael Buckner, \"Quotations that Support the Separation of State and Church\"\n \n A note on the reliability of your information.

   "Do deists and/or infidels take the Christian sacrament of the body of Christ, Electrolyte, as Washington did?? Pappillion?? \n\n My mistake. The letter may be true. The problem is that it doesn't say that Washington \"took the christian sacrament of the body of Christ,\" but that he did not. He left the church with George Custis after the blessing and left Martha to participate in the communion service. Washington sent the carriage back for Martha.\n \n But, one might assume that a sincere christian would be sure to attend Sunday services on a regular basis. One of the christian nation boys (easy or archy) even made a comment about how Washington's faithful attendance at church showed he was a christian. The following is a record from Washington's diary of his attendance. Those Sundays in which there is no record of Washington's attendance do not differ in detail from those Sundays on which he did attend church.\n \n 1768 - 15\n 1769 -10\n 1770 - 9\n 1771 - 6\n 1772 - 6\n 1773 - 5\n 1774 - 18This was the year of the Continental Congress and the diary records attendance 6 times in Philadelphia, only three of which were at Anglican churches. There followed the war and years in the wilderness attending to land interests, during which time the diary was incomplete or churches were not available.1785 - 1\n 1786 - 1\n 1787 - 3\n 1788 - 1The Presidential years during which the diary is incomplete. We know that Washington attended services from time to time at 2 churches in New York and two in Philadelphia.1797 - 4\n 1798 - 1\n 1799 - 2\n \n Hardly seems like a devout christian. Given Washington's record and writings, if christian nation nuts can claim that he was a devout christian, they will also, after my death, claim that I was a devout christian.\n \n Consider that there is no verified document (Barton's forgeries aside) in which Washington mentions jesus. There are a slight few wherein he used the word \"god,\" instead preferring such deistic phrases as \"Providence,\" \"the invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men,\" and \"the benign parent of the human race.\"\n \n I don't think that the christian nation twins can show us otherwise by citing references that we can check, outside of their christian nation web site.",

   "He didn't take \"the christian sacrament\". That's a lie. We know he didn't because his pastors said he didn't.\n \n\n \n Bull. \n \n You have your sources and I have mine that say otherwise.\n \n Here's more:\n \n Critics object that Washington never referred to Jesus; refused to partake of the Lord's Supper, and among other things, used Deistic language. Lillback skillfully rebuts all claims:\n \n (1) Washington did refer to Jesus, and those who say otherwise just ignore several letters where he recommends \"the author of our Faith\" (a reference to Christ in the book of Hebrews), and the religion of Jesus to the Indians. Also, Washington didn't like to speak of himself at all. It is not the case that he refused to speak of his Faith. Rather, he refused to speak of Washington.\n \n (2) It is true at times that Washington refused to take communion, but a number of points need to be made: a) this was not like the modern, high church Episcopalism. Due to the lack of ministers, and the frontier nature of the church, congregations would celebrate communion only a few times a year. Given that other evidence shows Washington took communion, this objection is actually a strong argument for Washington's faith: it is only a few times that Washington actually missed communion!\n \n http://www.puritanboard.com/f90/george-washingtons-sacred-fire-24718/\n \n Was George Washington a Christian? - Part Two \n \n \"Why do you not know how to interpret the present time?\" (Luke 12:56) \n \n In last week's commentary I examined the secularists' accusation that George Washington was not a Christian. They invariably call him a Deist, and try to pin that label on the rest of the Founding Fathers as well. They like to quote Paul Boller, Jr.'s 1963 work entitled George Washington & Religion, in which he accused our first President of being a Deist. \n \n The issue of Washington's Christianity is pivotal in the current moral and spiritual civil war for our nation's soul, for if these secularists can make a convincing case that the Founding Fathers were not Christians it would be a huge boost for their campaign to undermine the Biblical foundations of America. \n \n Last week, to define Deist for my readers I quoted Noah Webster's original 1828 American dictionary: \"one who believes in the existence of a God, but denies revealed religion.\" I added that the Deists emphatically rejected the divinity of Jesus Christ, the authority and inspiration of Holy Scripture, and the personal nature of God, among other things. They believed that God created the world but then wandered off and ignored it, and has never been heard from since. \n \n In examining carefully the voluminous research that objective historians have done on our first President, his spiritual life and character, and in doing my own research into his letters and speeches, I can say that there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that George Washington was not a Deist. He was not even close to being a Deist. \n \n Washington was a thoroughly Christian, low-Church Virginia Anglican, who subscribed in all points to orthodox New Testament doctrine. \n \n Last week we took up several important proofs of Washington's Christianity: First, I shared some of the evidence that he was man of prayer, and pointed out that most Deists never bothered with prayer. They didn't think God cared, and besides, since they didn't believe in sin, there was nothing to pray about, anyway! Second, I made the important point that Washington was quite familiar with his Bible. In Peter Lillback's magnificent book on Washington's Christian faith, Sacred Fire, he has listed in an appendix over 200 different Biblical phrases or passages, or allusions to Biblical passages. Many of these Washington used over and over in his letters and speeches. It is really quite remarkable how often Biblical passages or incidents cropped up in his thinking and writing. This man knew the Word of God. \n \n And he reverenced it, as well. Last week, I quoted from his famous Circular to the States, written to the thirteen State Governors right after the end of the War for Independence.  In that letter, he listed several developments that had blessed America, and then he wrote: \"and above all, the pure and benign light of Revelation (emphasis mine), have had ameliorating influence on mankind and increased the blessings of society.\" The word \"Revelation\" back then generally referred to the Bible, and more specifically to the Gospel of Christ revealed in the New Testament. Notice that he capitalized it, which though standard usage at that time, reveals his acceptance of the inspiration of Holy Scripture. And remember, Deists didn't believe in revelation, because they didn't think that God revealed anything about himself. \n \n Let's look at the secularists' claim that the Father of our country never used the names \"God\" or \"Jesus\" - which to them is evidence of his supposed Deism. For example, in 1926 historian Rupert Hughes wrote that, \"there is no direct allusion to Christ, and the word Christ has been found in none of Washington's almost countless autographs.\" \n \n This is sloppy history writing. Mr. Hughes didn't do his homework! In 1779, some Delaware Indian chiefs came to General George Washington's encampment, bringing three of their sons that they wanted the whites to educate. In his prepared speech the General said to them: \"You do well to wish to learn our arts and our way of life, and above all, the religion of Jesus Christ (emphasis mine). These will make you a greater and happier people than you are.\" That's putting it rather bluntly! No Deist would have been caught dead telling anyone that the most important thing they could learn was the religion of Jesus Christ. They simply didn't believe it. \n \n Granted, Washington hardly ever used the name of Jesus, either in speech or in writing, and he only referred to God by name about one hundred times. But, does this make him a Deist? Hardly. What it makes him is a typical devout 18th Century Virginia Anglican. In Washington's time Anglicans were very reticent about using the names of Jesus or God. As odd as it sounds to our modern ears, they were very concerned not to profane the sacred names by casual reference to them. Of course, because the Nicene Creed was regularly recited by Washington in the Anglican worship service on Sundays, he would have often professed the names of Jesus and God out loud. But that was sacred usage, with which he would have been totally comfortable. \n \n Martha Washington, who was a very strong Christian believer herself, almost always used indirect and honorific titles in place of the names of Jesus and God. Also, in Washington's personal sermon collection, there is a July 4, 1793 anniversary message from a Presbyterian minister named Samuel Miller who refers to God as: \"the supreme Arbiter of nations,\" \"the grand Source,\" \"the Deity himself,\" \"the Sovereign Dispenser of all blessings,\" \"the Governor of the universe,\" and so forth. Mr. Miller was certainly no Deist. So, this was common practice at the time, even for ministers of the Gospel. \n \n An interesting point is that the Deists were much more inclined to use the names of Jesus and God, precisely because of their lack of reverence. Thomas Paine, whom Lillback calls a \"soft\" Deist, used the name of God often, although he also used \"Creator,\" and \"Almighty.\" \n \n Profaning the holy names of Jesus and God, especially in cursing, was something that George Washington hated. In a General Order to his soldiers dated July 29, 1779, he deplored the fact that in spite of the \"many and pointed orders (that) have been issued against that unmeaning and abominable custom of swearing...with much regret the General observes that it prevails, if possible, more than ever; his feelings are continually wounded by the oaths and imprecations of the soldiers whenever he is in hearing of them. The Name of that Being...is incessantly...profaned in a manner as wanton as it is shocking.\" He goes on to say that he hopes that \"for the sake of religion, decency and order\" the officers will put a stop to it. Note that he is personally hurt by the swearing - obviously because of what the name of God means to him. And, in an order meant to stop the profane use of God's name, he refers to God indirectly, not wanting to use the name himself. \n \n Other typical examples of Washington's use of indirect titles for Jesus include \"our gracious Redeemer\" and the \"Divine author of our blessed religion.\" No Deist would ever use those titles! Among his many indirect titles for God (about 95 of them!) we find \"the Lord, and giver of victory\"; the \"Giver of Life\"; the \"Judge of the hearts of men\"; the \"great Lord and Ruler of nations\"; and his favorite - \"Providence,\" with a capital \"P.\" He used this one over 270 times! \n \n Peter Marshall Ministries, America's Christian Heritage, Restoring America, Christian Homeschool material and curriculum\n \n Some deist! Washington believed in a redeemer and in revealed religion!!\n \n Give it up, Pandion!",

   "He didn't take \"the christian sacrament\". That's a lie. We know he didn't because his pastors said he didn't.\n \n\n \n Balderdash!! Here's even more sources that record Washington taking communion:\n \n There are several testimonies of those who observed him take Holy Communion during the war. General S.H. Lewis of Augusta County, Virginia, in a letter dated December 14, 1855 quoted General Robert Porterfield as saying that &#8220;he had known General Washington personally for many years&#8230; I saw him myself on his knees receive the Sacrament of the Lord&#8217;s Supper.&#8221; There is also a story that Washington took Communion in the Presbyterian Church while the Continental Army was at Morristown, New Jersey for the winter of 1778-79. Dr. James Richards, who followed Rev. Timothy Johnes, the pastor when Washington was in Morristown, noted that &#8220;the report that Washington did actually receive the communion from the hands of Dr. Johnes was universally current during that period, and so far as I know, never contradicted. I have often heard it from the members of Dr. Johnes&#8217; family, while they added that a note was addressed by Washington to their father, requesting the privilege&#8230;&#8221; \n \n Lastly, there is what I believe is a very credible story from the pen of the Rev. Alexander Hamilton, Mrs. Alexander Hamilton&#8217;s great-grandson. In 1854, the Hamilton family held a reunion in New York City. Mrs. Hamilton, by then an old woman of ninety-six, was Continental Army General Phillip Schuyler&#8217;s daughter. She insisted on taking her seven-year-old great-grandson, along with other family members, to see St. Paul&#8217;s Church because she had something very important to tell him. When they got there she took him up to the chancel rail, and told him that she had been present in the church on George Washington&#8217;s inauguration day in 1789, when he had received Holy Communion. She made it clear to him that she wanted him to know that she had personally witnessed Washington receiving the Sacrament, so he could tell others. Rev. Hamilton recollected that her words were: &#8220;If anyone ever tells you that George Washington was not a communicantof the Church, you say that your great-grandmother told you to say that she had knelt at this chancel rail at his side and received with him the Holy Communion.&#8221;\n \n Peter Marshall Ministries, America's Christian Heritage, Restoring America, Christian Homeschool material and curriculum\n \n So here we have a man, Washington, who regularly attended church (duty permitting), quoted from the Bible, believed in divine revelation, was a Vestryman in the church, took communion, and you people claim he was a deist or an infidel??

You see, some of us, as opposed to you christian nation types, actually read books rather than get all our information from the Internet. As mentioned, the \"laws\" are from Franklin Steiner as reported in his book, \"The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents From Washington to F.D.R.\" published in 1936. But upon looking into the summary of the Laws, I see that Steiner actually took it from one of 29 essays, written by James Parton and published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1872 and 1873, and collected into a book, \"The Life of Thomas Jefferson\" in 1874.\n \n Parton comments on how the law was treated by pre-revolutionary Virginians:\n \"...it was treated as all Christian nations now treat the sublime moral code of Christ--all believe and none practice.\" That attitude doesn't seem to have changed.\n \n If you want to find out if the book hides something that I don't want you to find out, you're going to have to buy it and read it.

You spent some time thinking about this video.\n \n Just a question for you - hypothetical\n \n What would happen if we took a bunch of people, stuck them on a planet with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ - and say we left them there for a couple hundred thousand years. Are they more likely to come to the conclusion that Genesis 1 & 2 happened, some other random story of religious creation, or something a little closer to what scientists have come up with? Be honest!\n\n Well I think that the geology of the planet would influence everything. From religions to morals and scientific progression. Because long ago on our planet Europe not only thought the world was flat and they could fall over at the edge into an abyss but Europe generally didn't have knowledge of the Asian cultures until the silk road was active.

That is unless God came back again, spoke his word into a book through the scribblings of random religious scholars. If you accept that this is inevitable, you are delusional. \n \n The most likely thing would be for humans to come up with an entirely different religious doctrine. I would be willing to bet that it would pass through polytheism into monotheism as more information became available and eventually we would end up right where we are now. The problem with this scenario is that evolution would probably never be confirmed since our biological history would not be apparent.

   "I think a fundmental question regarding this Christian nation debate has been overlooked: Who cares?\n \n Even if the Christian nation supporters can prove that the intentions of the founding fathers of America was to create a nation that promotes the prosperity of Christians above all, they still have failed to show why it matters.\n \n What additional rules must we adopt to be in compliance with the Christian scriptures? Are we to oust all non-believers or anyone who follows a different God. What about Jews and Muslims? They still worship the same God they just don't believe you must go through Christ to reach Him. (Remember the 10 Commandments mention nothing of Jesus).\n \n The federal government still cannot impose any legislation that forces people to follow a specific set of religous ideals. To enact any laws that are Christian in nature violates everyones freedom of religion, including Christians. Just because you already believe doesn't mean you won't be affected. At this point the government would be taking the position that they know how you should love and honor your God better than you do.",

   "The point is that the tree didn't have to cause death, spiritual or otherwise. God made it so. \n\n \n You forget that God is a holy God and sin has consequences. Beside, He is the author of life so how dare you question His methods in how He applies justice. And did you completely miss the part of free will requiring a real choice in order to be more than a theoretical concept or an illusion? \n \n Do you realize that we are the only creatures God ever created which have free will? Even satan himself doesn't possess that characteristic in his nature or else fallen angels could be forgiven for their rebellion against God. But they can't, only we can since we were deceived in our innocence but the fallen angels rebelled after spending untold millennia in Gods presence.\n \n \nThis isn't the same scenario as a mother telling her child not to touch the stove because it's hot. The mother did not create heat transference therefore isn't resposible for the stove being hot. Whereas in the Garden. God created the tree to cause death.\n\n \n Wrong again, the tree didn't cause Mans spiritual death, disobedience to God did. All we had to do as a race to spend eternity in a perfect Garden and fellowship harmoniously with our Creator would have been to live in the presence of one tree which we all knew we must never touch. Beside that one thing which was a test of our free will, everything else in the world was at our disposal. And we couldn't do that with only 2 people on Earth.\n \n Everything else God has done with this human experiment has been designed to reunite us to our former state so He can fellowship with us once again which is why He created us originally.\n \n \nUltimately, the question that hasn't been answered is why. Why would God create humans, give them the ability to deny Him with the clause that if they do they will be sent to hell. It seems extremely self serving.\n\n \n All I have done throughout this exchange is explain why! I couldn't be more clear if I wrote it all again so if you haven't gotten it yet at least on an intellectual level if not on a spiritual level, I truly feel for you.\n \n \nYou misunderstand. I am not talking about a believers' motivation to accept God I am talking about an athiest. We are always told that we are heading for because of our non belief. If we were t began to believe with that as our motivation. What does that say about the merits of our new found belief?\n\n \n When I prayed that night I wasn't a believer at all. I was a 14 year old moslem kid who prayed as generic a prayer as I could think of. I referred to every god I could imagine and asked if either of you is the maker of my soul, the real and living God who knows and defines absolute truth, if absolute truth even exists, then please reveal yourself to me and I will follow you. But I want the true and living maker of my soul if you actually exist at all, or will I just live this life, die one day and become nothingness? If you exist, I want to know you.\n \n \nYou had your moment where faith was questioned and God responded. Is it possible for this not to happen for some people? Are some people just doomed from the start? If you respond stating that this only for people who are blinded by the truth. I will be required to respond with where is God's assurance in helping us see. Does he feel it is better for us to wander blindly?\n\n \n The bible say's \"to those who grope out into the darkness, I (God) will find YOU\". That is precisely what I did as an innocent teen who hungered to know if God was real or just a myth. All I can assure you of is that although it took 7 years, I met Him in Jesus Christ at around 21 years old. I wasn't going to church at all but was running into believers who witnessed to me at every turn.\n \n \nAnd I know you believe I am blind to the error of my ways, but know that I feel I see much clearer. I was once a believer and I lost faith in God and placed my faith in reason and earthly relationships rather than that of the ether.\n\n \n The wisdom of this world is foolishness to God, my friend. It doesn't matter how enlightened you think you are from a fleshly perspective, your understanding is folly compared to the wisdom which comes from the living God via His Holy Spirit which indwells all believers. We are tapped into the only true source of wisdom and knowledge. Wisdom which is far beyond our capacity to fully appreciate or understand beyond His grace to allow.",

   "Once again your perceptions are flawed and inaccurate regarding our relationship with God our maker. He did create us in His image and therefore perfect. If you remember the words of the book, He used to walk with Adam and Eve in the cool of the day before they chose to disobey His ONE warning to them not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. He understood that eating of it would cost them their innocence and therefore their holiness and sinlessness.\n\n \n This in no way dismisses JWilliam's point. He says that a God who creates us with an ultimatum creates us with no free will without damnation. Why would he do this?\n \n You have tried to say that our choices lead us to sin. God created the opportunity and the temptation. He allowed Adam and Eve to break an arbitrary rule that was only set in place to deny us a choice without damnation.\n \n Further, I never ate from the tree nor have I ever been given an ultimatum from God. My one year old never ate from the tree and I have a hard time believing that he is a sinner. That's one of the most unfounded claims in all of Christianity and I refuse to accept a god that treats his creation this way. Why do you insist God is so evil?",

   "This in no way dismisses JWilliam's point. He says that a God who creates us with an ultimatum creates us with no free will without damnation. Why would he do this?\n\n \n You have shown that your fleshly/humanist perspective is exactly the opposite of what God intended as the author of all life and therefore perfectly right and allowed to define the principles we should live by as His creation. You reveal your arrogance by questioning and then rejecting His plan for how we must live. \n \n And God wasn't making an ultimatum as you say, He warned them not to eat of a tree which held fruit that would steal our innocence from us. There were very real consequences from eating that fruit beyond disobedience to God and that was the awareness of evil which we were created innocent of.\n \n Also, for the third time in this exchange, without a choice to disobey God, free will would have been an illusion for Adam and Eve and nothing more that a theoretical concept. What God gave them by placing that very real tree in the center of the Garden was an opportunity to know a choice existed and to turn away from it by faith that they could believe their Father who visited with them daily and had warned them that eating of that tree would lead to their deaths. You keep blaming God for the selfishness and disobedience of Man. Is it beyond you people to take personal responsibility for our own actions?\n \n \nYou have tried to say that our choices lead us to sin. God created the opportunity and the temptation. He allowed Adam and Eve to break an arbitrary rule that was only set in place to deny us a choice without damnation.\n\n \n Bunk, once again, and it has been clearly explained directly above.\n \n \nFurther, I never ate from the tree nor have I ever been given an ultimatum from God. \n\n \n Once again you ignore the fact that we are all related to each other through Adam and Eve. We inherited the sin nature via the blood line of humanity, therefore it is through the shed blood of Messiah which redemption and forgiveness of sins is accomplished.\n Lev 17:11 'For the life [fn] of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood by reason of the life [fn] that makes atonement.'\n This passage from Leviticus which was speaking to animal sacrifice for the temporary forgiveness of the sins of Jews perfectly and concisely extends Gods future plan to sacrifice His own blood as \"Messiah,\" the perfect Lamb of God for the propitiation of all of the sins of Humanity, once and for all time. If you are able to appreciate and make this connection between the Old and New Testaments, it could lead to the eternal salvation of your soul.\n \n \nMy one year old never ate from the tree and I have a hard time believing that he is a sinner. That's one of the most unfounded claims in all of Christianity and I refuse to accept a god that treats his creation this way. Why do you insist God is so evil?\n\n \n Now, in regard to the alleged sin of your baby, when did I ever say that God held him responsible for his sin nature? There is such a thing as an age of accountability when God considers us old enough to know right from wrong and therefore take personal responsibility for our actions. That age is believed to be anywhere between the ages of 11 and 14 depending on the maturity of the average normally developed child. What we call special needs or children of retarded growth will be treated accordingly by God and may never reach the age of accountability. \n \n So, in response to your bolded slanderous assumption, it isn't I who is insisting God is evil, it is you who is since you believe the humanist lies which misrepresent how God actually deals with innocent children, in reality.",

This is something you can't refute and no one can as has been proven ad nauseum here in this thread and many others.\n Regurgitating quotes from an ancient collection of writings by ancient primitive people doesn't change the fact that God is Evil.\n \n He put evil in the angels who acted accordingly, he put the snake in the Garden of Eden and he put there the tree and its fruits also; and he knew because he knows past, present and future that Adam and Eve would eat of the fruit. So much for free will.\n \n By the way, if a person is convicted of a crime are also his descendants sent to jail? No one but Adam and Eve ate of the fruit but we according to your fantasy (beliefs) have also been punished.\n \n But, wait a sec. didn't He send his one and only son to atone for Adam and Eve's actions? if so how come nothing has changed, no garden of eden in sight.\n \n How can people be so stupid as to believe in that XXXX? Imbecility is boundless and eternal.\n \n You are an Evil person Archie, as many power hungry believers are who think that by quoting from the Bible they can hide their hateful evil nature.\n \n Throwing the Bible at anyone who disagrees with you doesn't make you a good person, it just shows what a petty wanna be dictator you are.\n \n If God exists, he'll ban you to Hell just for the fun of it. emoticon_xgood",

And did you completely miss the part of free will requiring a real choice in order to be more than a theoretical concept or an illusion?\n\n \n No, I didn't miss that part. I was at work when I responded and forgot to include it. The point that I am trying to make is that the freewill God bestows upon us is the illusion. \"You obey me or else you go to hell.\"\n \n Damnation is the part that bothers me. Athiests don't reject God because we want to go to hell. We don't look at the description of hell and say \"That's where I got be!\" It's not the decision we make. We reject God because they're nothing tangible that proves He exists. I know it's a matter of faith. But there are people I won't loan money to because I can't trust them to return it. But I am expected to trust my soul and spirtual life to a being whose only proven existence lies in the hands of those who already believe? Those same people tell me that if I don't agree with them than I'm going straight to hell regardless of how I live my life. My denial of God no way dictates the way in which I will live my life. Even if I do everything in my power to make this world a better place for all and leave this earth better than when I arrived I will still have to suffer an eternity because I did so not believing in God.\n \n \n \nDo you realize that we are the only creatures God ever created which have free will? Even satan himself doesn't possess that characteristic in his nature or else fallen angels could be forgiven for their rebellion against God. But they can't, only we can since we were deceived in our innocence but the fallen angels rebelled after spending untold millennia in Gods presence.\n\n \n If you can rebel you have freewill. Athiests do not rebel against God nor do we disobey. We are just not convinced of His existence.\n \n \n \nWrong again, the tree didn't cause Mans spiritual death, disobedience to God did. All we had to do as a race to spend eternity in a perfect Garden and fellowship harmoniously with our Creator would have been to live in the presence of one tree which we all knew we must never touch. Beside that one thing which was a test of our free will, everything else in the world was at our disposal. And we couldn't do that with only 2 people on Earth.\n\n \n This just shows that it is in our nature to be inquisitive. They didn't disobey God, they followed their instincts to understand our world. The way God created them. Yes, there may be things that we would rather not know. But being naive to evil is not a good thing. They only way to recognize good is to know evil.\n \n \nEverything else God has done with this human experiment has been designed to reunite us to our former state so He can fellowship with us once again which is why He created us originally.\n\n \n This is what I was searching for when I kept asking why. So, this is an experiment? I will not presume to ask you what is He attempting to discover as this will result in you having to question your God's wisdom and methods and I will not ask you to do that. But I will say that if we are His experiment than this speaks to God's infallibilty i.e. if He has to experiment there is something He doesn't know therefore He cannot infallible because in order to experiment you have to presume you can be wrong.\n \n If he is infallible than He knows the results of the experiement and went through with it anyways. His reasons can only be known by Him, but I would say that there is something fundmentally wrong with this as He is allowing people to harmed in this experiement He already knows the answers to.\n \n Furthermore, Why does He long for our companionship? Why does He need us to obey? I understand that we are to prosper from a relationship with God. But what does he get out of it?\n \n \nThe bible say's \"to those who grope out into the darkness, I (God) will find YOU\". That is precisely what I did as an innocent teen who hungered to know if God was real or just a myth. All I can assure you of is that although it took 7 years, I met Him in Jesus Christ at around 21 years old.

We are tapped into the only true source of wisdom and knowledge. Wisdom which is far beyond our capacity to fully appreciate or understand beyond His grace to allow.\n\n \n We will probably have to agree to disagree on this one. You must understand that when I left the faith I felt that more opportunities for knowledge presented itself. I felt that religion stifled my spiritual growth because it demand that accept one group of ideals and reject all others. My rejectetion of religion resulted in the ability to explore all avenues of spirtual and mental progression and pick and choose which ideals yo adapt yo my life style.\n \n Futhermore it is not the answers that fascinate me but the pursuit. Take music as an example. We all marvel at a persons ability to play one note and say everything that song is supposed to say. But we fail to recognize the notes that came before it and made it so great. Religion requires that we reach that one note and continue playing that note. I reject that notion and strive to find away to make all notes sound good under their repective contexts. You learn more from the pursuit of knowledge than you do from the resulting answer.\n \n Now, I understand that this weekend is eventful for you so I cannot submit this post without saying that I wish you and your family all the best and Happy Easter.",

   "Okay Archie, I'm going to begin by stating that I don't believe your evil. We may disagree but I don't believe your intentions are to cause me harm. You've been gracious enough to try to answer my questions to the best of your ability.\n \n But I feel I must reiterate the athiest position. For us it's not about right and wrong. We are not choosing evil over good. And we do not feel we are being disobedient. We are simply not convinced. It's not as if we see God and then deny His existence. The point is we don't see God. We understand that this is a matter of faith. However, we need more than a book full of unproven conjectures to take that leap. And because of this we are told that we are to expect eternal damnation. We are not comfortable with this philosophy as we are being shunned not for any wrong doing but because we are simply not complacent.\n \n Furthermore, our non belief does not automatically equate to us doing ill will. We can lead a good life in spite of God's existence. Our ability to know right from wrong does not stem from some supreme being. And just because we don't believe does not mean we are going to do wrong. We can live peacefully, joyously and harmoniously with one another without the belief of God or the Bible.\n \n Our issue with the Bible is that it speaks of many things that just no longer apply. It condoned slavery, the stoning of your children and promoted the idea of men above women. These are all philosophies that we no longer accept as fact. Additionally, it was used to prove the world was flat and then to prove geocentrism. Both of which we know now to be false. However, we are expected to follow every word as truth. God may have spoken directly to man and asked us to transcribe his words for Him, but I do not feel the pen holders wrote everything down verbatim.\n \n Personally I feel that God never intended the Bible to be presented as \"letter of the law\". And I am aware that there are passages that state otherwise. However, I feel they were placed to serve mans interest and not God's. There are several different Christian religions that all believe that they serve God and the Bible better than all and feel all others will be going to Hell for their trespass. The Protestants and the Catholics fought and killed for years because of their discrepancies. Not to mention, the non-Christian religions such as the Jews and Muslims who have been fighting even longer over holy land. All of them killing in the honor of God. All of them believing that they are more right than the other. I may not believe in God, but I refuse to believe that He intended people to murder in His name. I also don't believe that he intended for His word to separate people but to bring them together. And once again, this is why I don't feel that the Bible was meant to be taken literally. Ultimately, I feel that it was not the words He cared about but the message.\n \n The reason I'm an atheist is because I don't feel I need a religion to lead a good life.\n \n I hope I was clear enough above for you to understand where we as athiests stand and why.\n \n Have a great holiday.

   "Now, all we must do is accept what He did for us to be saved. It couldn't be any simpler a process, yet you atheists get hung up on the fact that you're a sinner who can't reach Him any other way. You act like Him doing all the work to redeem you isn't good enough for some reason\n\n Speaking for myself, it's not that it isn't 'good enough', it's that it makes absolutely no sense. Or rather, it only makes sense if one is an atheist. That might seem a little bizarre; allow me to elaborate.\n \n First of all there's the notion of 'original sin', which is mad enough in itself for any number of reasons. But ok, let's suppose god has decided that's how it's going to work. So there we all are a few thousand years later, being born in sin, and god changes his mind. But for some reason, he can't just forgive us. Instead there's this whole rigmarole of taking on flesh and sacrificing himself to himself.\n \n Here's the question that stops me in my tracks: why would it work?\n \n After all, god supposedly decides how everything works. So at some point he would have had to decide that sacrificing his earthly avatar would redeem our sins in order for it to work.\n \n So when was this point, exactly? When did he decide to install this loophole?\n \n Well, if it was after original sin had been committed, then the whole narrative is a bizarre charade: if god was able to install a loophole after-the-fact, he can't have been 'bound' in any sense by his earlier decision. He could simply have announced his forgiveness - by any yardstick the second most important event in history - to all and sundry rather than having himself messily and obscurely killed and then relying on the propagation of a book which has, despite two thousand years and the invention of the printing press, failed to convince most of the people on the planet.\n \n The alternative, that he installed the 'Jesus' loophole in the way original sin 'worked' at or prior to original sin even occurring, is clearly even more bonkers.\n \n And this is just the tip of the iceberg. When you consider that god is supposed to exist outside of time, the whole process descends into insanity.\n \n As I said at the start, though, it's a madness that 'clicked' for me when I gained an atheist's perspective.\n \n The revelation I had was this: everyone would have believed god if he had shown up and said \"Hi guys. Um. Original sin? Totally my bad. Sorry about that. You're officially forgiven. As you were.\" But nobody would believe some guy who just stood up one day and said \"God told me you're all off the hook.\" As far as people at the time were concerned, things just didn't work like that. It would be like me telling you the taxman didn't want your money any more. That's how Jesus makes sense: he picked up a tab people would be too scared to believe had been waived entirely. And even then, he only makes sense in the context of a purely man made religious revolution.",

And for once in your life be honest enough to admit that just because you refuse to accept my explanations, it doesn't mean that I haven't offered them. You continue to spew the lies of your father, the devil because that is all you know to give. How sad it will be on that final day when you will remember your many blasphemies and regret your situation as you finally realize that you will have an eternity to consider the false god you followed for a wasted and squandered life time. You are as much an enemy of the light and the truth as your father the devil is whom you reflect in every post you write.

But you would need a brain transplant to see this. \n So keep clutching your Bible to your breast Archie, without it you are scared of facing life and death.",

   "Okay Archie, I'm going to begin by stating that I don't believe your evil. We may disagree but I don't believe your intentions are to cause me harm. You've been gracious enough to try to answer my questions to the best of your ability.\n\n \n Gee thanks, how gracious of you to not think I'm evil because I believe in and follow a Messiah who commands that I pray for those who hate me. You are magnanimous to a fault, my lost friend. emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nBut I feel I must reiterate the athiest position. For us it's not about right and wrong. We are not choosing evil over good. And we do not feel we are being disobedient. We are simply not convinced. It's not as if we see God and then deny His existence. The point is we don't see God. We understand that this is a matter of faith. However, we need more than a book full of unproven conjectures to take that leap. And because of this we are told that we are to expect eternal damnation. We are not comfortable with this philosophy as we are being shunned not for any wrong doing but because we are simply not complacent.\n \n Furthermore, our non belief does not automatically equate to us doing ill will. We can lead a good life in spite of God's existence. Our ability to know right from wrong does not stem from some supreme being. And just because we don't believe does not mean we are going to do wrong. We can live peacefully, joyously and harmoniously with one another without the belief of God or the Bible.\n\n \n I basically have no issue with any of this and accept it as your sincere beliefs and an accurate outline of your value system. The question is, so what if at the end of your life you learn that everything you believed, or didn't believe about the living God condemns you to an eternity apart from His love because you chose that path yourself? \n \n \nOur issue with the Bible is that it speaks of many things that just no longer apply. It condoned slavery, the stoning of your children and promoted the idea of men above women. These are all philosophies that we no longer accept as fact. Additionally, it was used to prove the world was flat and then to prove geocentrism. Both of which we know now to be false. However, we are expected to follow every word as truth. God may have spoken directly to man and asked us to transcribe his words for Him, but I do not feel the pen holders wrote everything down verbatim.\n\n \n You confuse Gods values, holiness and character which never changes, with mans cultural setting which has never stopped changing. The fact is that God is the same yesterday, today and forever; it is only mans environment which devolves with new technology and cultural degradations which digress with the ever worsening morality of the human condition. \n \n What is so incredible about you humanists is that you perceive the world as becoming more enlightened when it is becoming more reprobate with each passing moment. You see us born again christians as backward thinking simpletons when you will learn that it was only we who held the truth regarding this spiritual battle between good and evil in which humanity is involved. \n \n \nPersonally I feel that God never intended the Bible to be presented as \"letter of the law\". And I am aware that there are passages that state otherwise. However, I feel they were placed to serve mans interest and not God's. \n\n \n You feel a lot of things J, but you have the eternal perspective of a gnat compared to the God who is called Alpha and Omega. Your arrogance is mind numbing to believe that you possess any rational insights which are worthy of judging Him or His plan for humanity since He can see the end of the race at the same time as He views the beginning of it.\n \n \n There are several different Christian religions that all believe that they serve God and the Bible better than all and feel all others will be going to Hell for their trespass. The Protestants and the Catholics fought and killed for years because of their discrepancies. Not to mention, the non-Christian religions such as the Jews and Muslims who have been fighting even longer over holy land. All of them killing in the honor of God. All of them believing that they are more right than the other. \n\n \n You make the typical error of all secular humanists when you hold God responsible for the sins and shortcomings of Man. I will never defend Man in his corruption of Gods values but neither will I judge God or hold Him responsible for Mans corruption of His principles.\n \n \n I may not believe in God, but I refuse to believe that He intended people to murder in His name. I also don't believe that he intended for His word to separate people but to bring them together. And once again, this is why I don't feel that the Bible was meant to be taken literally. Ultimately, I feel that it was not the words He cared about but the message.\n\n \n What bothers me and confuses me about your post is that at the very same time that you insist that you don't believe in God, you say you refuse to believe that \"He\" intended people to murder in His name. How can you refuse to believe anything a God you don't believe even exists, intended at all? It makes no sense but your paragraph above discusses Him in the first person throughout. That's a pretty neat trick coming from an atheist who doesn't believe He exists at all.\n \n \nThe reason I'm an atheist is because I don't feel I need a religion to lead a good life.\n\n \n You don't need religion to lead a good life. Religion is a man made institution which will always be flawed at its core. But you do need a personal relationship with God through His perfect Lamb, Jesus Christ, our Messiah in order to find true and everlasting peace which surpasses all understanding. And you need to get past this fleshly understanding and look at the spiritual side of your being. \n \n \nI hope I was clear enough above for you to understand where we as athiests stand and why.\n\n \n Yes, you were very clear, unfortunately for you I have heard it all before and even believed much of it before I received Gods Holy Spirit to indwell me and learned the absolute truths about life and why I exist.\n \n \nHave a great holiday. And may you and yours find comfort in the truth you seek.\n\n \n You too...",

That makes PERFECT sense. \n \n \nNice try, but we weren't discussing the church, but countries which banned christianity. This isn't about the sins of the catholic church of which there are too many to cite, we're talking about countries which have banned christianity and the bible as compared to Homer and other works of fiction over the millennia, stay on point if possible. \n\n \n So on the one hand we have had about 50 years of various countries banning the bible. On the other hand we had a little over 1500 years of it being heavily promoted both by governments and by the church, with torture and death being the alternative for the vast majority of that history. \n \n \nMore atheist assumptions which have no basis in fact at all. If you only understood how independent and questioning I was and am as a person you would realize how ignorant your assumptions are.

Just because you are incapable of appreciating the reality of that spiritual dimension or the relationship has no bearing at all on its truth to every believer who has personally experienced it.\n\n \n Nope. Not an atheist. Not an atheist assumption with no basis in fact. Christianity is tops when it comes to religions to control people. It was designed this way from day one. The bible you claim is the word of god is the manual to do it.\n \n Have you ever read any of the books that did NOT make it into the bible? Many of them were older than the ones that did The gospels, for example, were not written by Mathew, Mark, Luke, and John, those guys had been dead for AT LEAST 100 years before any of those books was written which probably explains some of the rank historical inaccuracies in them. \n \n Take a look at the gospel of Thomas. It is a reasonably good example of the books that did NOT make it into the bible. From what we can tell it is older than the books that DID make it into the NT. It does not have the historical problems that the other books have. \n \n What is DOES contain is several quotes from jesus like:\n \n \nJesus said, \"If your leaders say to you, 'Look, the (Father's) kingdom is in the sky,' then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you. Rather, the (Father's) kingdom is within you and it is outside you. \n\n \n \nJesus said, \"I am the light that is over all things. I am all: from me all came forth, and to me all attained.\n \n Split a piece of wood; I am there.\n \n Lift up the stone, and you will find me there.\" \n\n \n There were other books that could have been in the bible as well. Many of them are more credible than the ones that made it in. ALL of them contained a similar theme to the above....that you dont need a church or a priest to tell you about god. You dont need a book to understand him. \n \n Amazingly enough when the church came up with \"the bible\" they did not include the books that said they were not needed and it was up to the individual to forge a relationship with god. What the priests came up with instead was a book that seemed to indicate that you should give money to priests and venerate them. \n \n Governments then were a little more familiar with religious power plays then than they are now, but as long as it included bits about giving to Caesar what is Caesar they were on board with the whole thing. \n \n Jesus did not come to earth to start a religion. He was fighting organized religion. If he wanted to start a religion he could have written his own gospel and avoided thousands of years of conflict. That really only leaves 2 options. The first is that he was an ID10T. Son of god, mentally retarded. He just didnt realize that by not writing down his own thoughts he was screwing us over until he got a chance to swing by again. I mean, here we are, damned if we dont follow the rules, and he did not even leave us a reliable list of them.\n \n The other option, the FAR more likely one, is that in the end, those with power won in the end. They took his message, edited it down to something that left them with control over peoples minds and actions, and sold it to the rest of the world. \n \n Jesus chose illiterate fishermen and common people as his followers. He did not run around ordaining priests and building churches. He loathed those things. And yet you trust a book put together by a bunch of men who DID put emphasis on those things to pass on the word of god to you??",

They forget that their denials of Gods truths have no bearing at all on His truths being real and valid to those who trust Him and accept them. \n\n \n Always forgetting a more realistic example would be having hundreds of people peddling maps, some for free, some charging, with maps contradicting each other and making little sense. And when you decide to try to rationally think about which of the hundreds of maps could be the right one, you see that the cave, if you look beyond the first corridor, doesn't look anything like what ANY of the maps claim.",

   "There have not been \"many attempts to destroy it throughout history\". \n \n \n How about this....I am not an atheist....I am an agnostic, and I still know the bible it pretty much a bunch of XXXX. \n \n The bible is a fairly interesting, though badly outdated, book of moral lessons. No more, no less. \n \n No, they reject it as being valid because it is nonsensical and illogical to believe it is. You can pretend it is, but that is you substituting wishful thinking and willful ignorance (which you will label \"faith) for using the intelligence that god gave you.\n \n Or they dont recognize the truths in it because they dont exist. \n \n No, I am not calling any part of my humanity crapola. I am calling the bible crapola. \n \n Right....so we forget the VAST majority of the last 2000 years and focus on the VERY short time period where your position is correct, then argue that since TODAY that is the case, it has always been so. That makes PERFECT sense. \n \n So on the one hand we have had about 50 years of various countries banning the bible. On the other hand we had a little over 1500 years of it being heavily promoted both by governments and by the church, with torture and death being the alternative for the vast majority of that history. \n \n Nope. Not an atheist. Not an atheist assumption with no basis in fact. Christianity is tops when it comes to religions to control people. It was designed this way from day one. The bible you claim is the word of god is the manual to do it.\n \n Have you ever read any of the books that did NOT make it into the bible? Many of them were older than the ones that did The gospels, for example, were not written by Mathew, Mark, Luke, and John, those guys had been dead for AT LEAST 100 years before any of those books was written which probably explains some of the rank historical inaccuracies in them. \n \n Take a look at the gospel of Thomas. It is a reasonably good example of the books that did NOT make it into the bible. From what we can tell it is older than the books that DID make it into the NT. It does not have the historical problems that the other books have. \n \n What is DOES contain is several quotes from jesus like:\n \n There were other books that could have been in the bible as well. Many of them are more credible than the ones that made it in. ALL of them contained a similar theme to the above....that you dont need a church or a priest to tell you about god. You dont need a book to understand him. \n \n Amazingly enough when the church came up with \"the bible\" they did not include the books that said they were not needed and it was up to the individual to forge a relationship with god. What the priests came up with instead was a book that seemed to indicate that you should give money to priests and venerate them. \n \n Governments then were a little more familiar with religious power plays then than they are now, but as long as it included bits about giving to Caesar what is Caesar they were on board with the whole thing. \n \n Jesus did not come to earth to start a religion. He was fighting organized religion. If he wanted to start a religion he could have written his own gospel and avoided thousands of years of conflict. That really only leaves 2 options. The first is that he was an ID10T. Son of god, mentally retarded. He just didnt realize that by not writing down his own thoughts he was screwing us over until he got a chance to swing by again. I mean, here we are, damned if we dont follow the rules, and he did not even leave us a reliable list of them.\n \n The other option, the FAR more likely one, is that in the end, those with power won in the end. They took his message, edited it down to something that left them with control over peoples minds and actions, and sold it to the rest of the world. \n \n Jesus chose illiterate fishermen and common people as his followers. He did not run around ordaining priests and building churches. He loathed those things. And yet you trust a book put together by a bunch of men who DID put emphasis on those things to pass on the word of god to you??\n\n \n As I read your repeat of the same objections you posted in the last 2 responses to me, it occurred to me that one of my personal quotes in my siggy says it all in regard to your preferred self delusions in life. Here it is for your edification, if that is even possible.\n \n You cannot avoid the truth forever even though you can deny it for a lifetime. ~ Archangel\n \n Anything else I respond with is a waste of time.",

That is the act of a church trying desperately to cover up the fact that they have pushed an edited and incorrect view of Jesus life in people and were doing their best to destroy all evidence to the contrary. \n \n THE TRUTH does not need centuries of murders to destroy evidence to the contrary.\n \n Teach me? About god? You know NOTHING AT ALL of god. You wont respond because you CANT. You have been worshiping a lie and deep down you know it. You have pulled your understanding of god from a book that was designed to control you, not to bring you closer to god. A book that perverts the message of Jesus to something that is exactly opposite of what all evidence shows he preached. \n \n Let me know how that works out for you. Whoops. Never mind. You wont know until you are dead and roasting in hell for not only failing to understand the nature of god, but for steering people toward the false message that is contained in the bible that you venerate.\n\n \n Spoken like a true atheist and heretic as you reinterpret history in order to satisfy your unbelief in the accuracy of the bible. You see, I have no reason to oppose or defend myself against your lies and misinformation since it is God whom you are attacking and not me. I can rest easy in knowing that on that final day when you enter eternity, you will instantaneously know the absolute truth and you will realize that you made yourself an enemy of God and His truths when you attacked His given word as false and libelous. \n \n You credit Eusebius as if he worked alone when he was but one of 318 members of the first council of Nicaea. How convenient for your preferred recreation of history; and which Eusebius were you referring to anyway, Eusebius of the city of Nicomedia, or Eusebius of Caesarea. And what evidence do you offer that he single handedly selected the 50 books which you attribute to him? Just like in our past debate, you lie and make stuff up as you go along since it sounds good to you but has absolutely no basis in fact at all from any sound theological source AT ALL!!! emoticon_rolleyes",

You deceive yourself and attempt to deceive others with your lies which destroy rather than build up Gods word for what it is, a good and positive source of wisdom for any and all who trust its wisdom for the guidance of their lives.\n\n \n No, I am tearing down trust in a book put together, by the admission of the guy who did it, to serve the interests of the church and the government. \n \n I dont have a desire to know god. I do know god. I generally trust in what we know of his word, I just prefer the version that was not admittedly put together in order to advance the agenda of a relatively few powerful people. \n \n You are the one deceiving people and others. I am not calling you a liar....I think you honestly believe most of the garbage that you post here. It just happens to be demonstrably false and frankly I dont think that you have enough integrity OR enough actual faith in your relationship with god to even examine that possibility. \n \n That is why you have not constructed anything resembling a logical argument to refute mine. I am not even asking for proof. I am more than willing to admit that proof may be hard to come by since it would be thousands of years old and frankly the church burned most of it. I am just asking for a logical argument. How can you possibly reconcile what we know about jesus with what is in the bible and what our religious leaders tell us to believe? Do you really not know enough about your own religions history to recognize that it has primarily been a tool to elevate a few men to positions of great power? Had it not ever occurred to you that when Jesus went looking for a holy man to baptize him he went to John instead of a priest? John the baptist was not only completely unorthodox, he was unorthodox to the point that many people thought he was a lunatic. \n \n If your relationship with god is based on the bible, or on a church, or on a priest or preacher, then you have none and I pity you because you so desperately want one. That is what all your religious blather is about. You know that you are not going to convince anybody here that you have even the first clue when it comes to god, but that is OK because you are trying to convince yourself, not any of us. And the funny thing is that if and when you finally do find that relationship with god, you will shut up because it is indescribable. It is like trying to describe what air looks like. IF you actually knew god, you would quit blathering on about the bible and about what a great thing modern Christianity is because you would understand that, in the words of Jesus:\n \n \n\"If your leaders say to you, 'Look, the Father's kingdom is in the sky,' then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you. Rather, the Father's kingdom is within you and it is outside you.\n \n When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will understand that you are children of the living Father. But if you do not know yourselves, then you live in poverty, and you are the poverty.\" \n\n \n You dont need a book. You dont need a priest. God is not a coin operated vending machine where you perform the proper acts and POOF he is compelled to appear. Pouring water on a babies head does not do anything for god. Pouring water on an ADULTS head does not do anything for god. It is what that symbolizes in the recipients mind that matters. God could care less whether your head is wet or dry.\n \n Once you figure these things out, you can learn to sit quietly and listen for God and submit to his will. THEN you will know god. Right now you just know what man says about god, and that is about worthless. \n \n This is why jesus used so many terrible metaphors. He was trying to describe the indescribable in a way that people could understand. \n \n I know all the atheists out there are by now convinced I am mildly schizophrenic. I cannot contest that besides saying that I know they are wrong. I cannot build a logical argument for them being wrong. I cannot explain logically ho I know they are wrong. I just know they are and that is enough.\n \n Hopefully someday you will find God....REALLY find God....and you will know that kind of peace and freedom.",

He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 13And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. 14You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.\n Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit\n 15\"If you love me, you will obey what I command. 16And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever- 17the Spirit of truth.
