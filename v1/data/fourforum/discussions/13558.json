Which lulzy enough some of you against me getting the operation would have banned <_< Like really I'll never understand pro-life people who feel the need to stick their noses in other people's private business. Frankly even if I did regret it you should not care because its not your body! \n \n Oh and the the don't have sex argument: what am I not supposed to have sex until I'm ready to have kids? (Not even married because some married couples don't plan on having kids!) Yeah how about you do that and leave my body alone.\n\n \n My advice to you is...next time you don't want people to stick their noses in your business, don't post it to a discussion forum. You sound like a person that goes to a nudist colony and then complains that nobody's dressed. Jeez!\n \n And, in case you are interested, if my offspring would have a 90% chance of getting sickle cell anemia, I'd do just what you're planning on doing. \n It would have been easier to agree with you if you had made that statement in your first post. \n \n Good luck",

I NEVER want children. That's not to say that I hate them, as I LOVE all children, as I babysit when I'm not working at the diner, but I just don't want them.

He didn't oppose when the other girls that came to him had abortions, but I can't stop a baby that might come, rather than killing one that's already on it's way?

   "It has been brought to my attention, that getting your tubes tied or burned is considered abortion.\n \n Why?\n \n Well, because you are preventing a human life.\n \n I, of course, don't agree.\n \n However, it has been made clear that it is preventing life by preventing the egg that might be fertilized from being fertilized. \n \n I think that it is not fair. Say, perhaps, that the egg would never get fertilized? Then could I get my tubes tied? But, you will never know if the egg will ever produce into something more, until you die. So, should I not do what I want, based on something that I will never know?\n \n What do you think?\n\n \n You have obviously been told this by a pro-choicer who will leap to any rationale no matter how shallow in order to justify his/her defense for abortion. He fails to appreciate that preventing an egg from being fertilized is not at all similar to murdering a fetus which is in many cases at a minimum of up to 3 months of development. \n \n \nThis annoys me personally I asked my doctor if I could get my tubes tied because I don't want kids I'm 17 I asked him to do it when I turned 18. He says \"No.\" and I doubt you'll be able to find anyone who will. \n \n O_O So I can get an abortion at 14 but I can't get my tubes tied when I'm legal age? So much for a woman's right to choose. <_<\n\n \n Hi Ryuuichi, If I might defend your doctor for a second, I think I can explain his thinking. He/she understands that what you think you want at 17 yrs. old MIGHT be very different than what you will want when you are in your 20s and in love with your potential soul mate. At that time, when the man of your dreams is real and you two actually discuss your future lives together, if you then decide to get your tubes tied and never have children, he will be confident that your decision is rational and based on a mutual decision with your spouse. \n \n See the difference? To make that decision now could and probably would be greatly regretted since most men you meet in your 20s who fall in love with you will desire to have children with you one day. Very few men would choose to marry a woman who could never give them natural children. In fact, I can say with confidence that to make such a permanent decision without including the man you will fall in love with and want to marry one day is probably the most selfish decision a woman could make. Think about it as a woman in love some day and you will see my point, I'm sure. emoticon_xangel",

   "\n Hi Ryuuichi, If I might defend your doctor for a second, I think I can explain his thinking. He/she understands that what you think you want at 17 yrs. old MIGHT be very different than what you will want when you are in your 20s and in love with your potential soul mate. At that time, when the man of your dreams is real and you two actually discuss your future lives together, if you then decide to get your tubes tied and never have children, he will be confident that your decision is rational and based on a mutual decision with your spouse. \n \n See the difference? To make that decision now could and probably would be greatly regretted since most men you meet in your 20s who fall in love with you will desire to have children with you one day. Very few men would choose to marry a woman who could never give them natural children. In fact, I can say with confidence that to make such a permanent decision without including the man you will fall in love with and want to marry one day is probably the most selfish decision a woman could make. Think about it as a woman in love some day and you will see my point, I'm sure. emoticon_xangel\n\n \n I understand this logic, but it really is rather condescending. And I am not just condemning you, it is far broader than you. We as a species are still getting over the idea that women, especially young women are incapable of making their own decisions, that somehow all you boys know what best for us/them. If the young woman is certain she does not want children, a man who does would hardly be her soul mate.

The very implication is absurd based on anything said in this discussion.\n \n Of course you would. You will always choose irrational and impulsive reactions rather than advising patience, a cooling down period and very thoughtful considerations before making a life altering decision. Even when the woman is only between 17 and 21 years old.\n\n \n I think overall we agree. A minor should not make this choice, but an adult certainly should be able to. What the doctor considers to be biological maturity is irrelevant. Once someone is an adult they should be granted all the rights, privileges and responsibilities of an adult. We have determined that age is 18. At 18 an you can own property, vote, marry, be shipped off to fight and die in war, be tried as an adult in a court of law, are responsible for your own debt, etc. You should also be able to make your own medical decisions, consume alcohol, etc. If 18 is too young for some of it, then it is too young for all of it. Now, I could easily be convinced that the age of adulthood should be raised to 19, 20, or even 21 - - but if we do they remain a child in the eyes of the law for everything. The inconsistency doesn't fly for me.\n \n Also - even in the case of the minor, the decision does not and should not belong to the doctor, but to the legal gaurdians of the individual in question. I would be LIVID if a doctor were to attempt to make any major medical decision for me or my child.",

   "I have never heard that any form of pre-conception contraception were equaled to abortion.\n\n \n Unless of course you're Catholic. Any type of conception, while not considered \"abortion\" per se is still considered by the Catholic Church to be denying God's will and taking matters into your own hands... essentially playing God. \n \n And I know somebody will have something to say about religion, but I please ask that anybody responding to this realize that I was only posting this information to let Iuris and others know that there are some who consider \"pre-conception contraception\" as not in line with the will of God according to their religion (specifically Catholicism in this case). It's not meant to spark a debate about religion, just factual information. \n \n I personally don't hold these beliefs. \n \n \nRather, I've heard it expressed that any sex that is not intended for procreation is sinful. A bit of difference.\n\n \n This is generally true with respect to Christian religions although you may still get some variance from one specific sect to another or even one specific church within a specific sect to another. \n \n I was always told this. \n \n \nAnd Ryuuichi, a decision not to have children is something that a 17 year old is far from ready to make. The reversibility of the procedure is questionable. As for abortion, it is generally a one time effect and does not lead to permanent infertility (except perhaps as a rare unwanted side effect).\n\n \n I absolutely agree. Likewise, I don't think they're fully mature or ready in any sense of the word to make a decision on the life of an unborn child either. This is a conundrum of the pro-choice supporters who don't believe a child needs to have their parents informed of their decision to abort or that the parents/guardians of these children even need to know anything about it before or afterwards.",
