The Bible, although thousands of years old, has many scientific, historic, and prophetic lines and predictions that are all accurate.

Many of these predictions could not have been the result of unscientific, ignorant men (as some atheists have said). This is only a short post, but if you want, feel free to ask me to provide some of these 100% accurate predictions. If the Bible was the word of men, than it should not be consistant in it's message (i.e. one of Paradise Lost - Genesis - to Paradise Regained - Revelations) remembering that the Bible was written over a time period of 1,600 years.\n \nMy question is mainly for Christians, but it's relevant to all religions with recorded scriptures.

   "That's alright, I COMPLETELY understand - quote shown in bold.\n \n To SirGladius:\n I am not quite sure as to whether or not you meant that. Anyway, here are a few examples of scientificly accurate verses: the fact that the Earth is round; the hydrologic cycle; the sea currents; the fact that living things reproduce after their own kind (observational evidence); the fact that the stars are countless (people of old thought that the stars could be counted - there was about 1200 visible stars. Ptolemy (150 AD) dogmatically stated that the number of stars was exactly 1056); many insights into health, hygiene, diet, physiology (such as the importance of blood); the first and second laws of thermodynamics (e.g. Isa 51:6); and many other things. [The Updated and Expanded Answers Book ~ Answers in Genesis Ministries, p.6] Many of the above came from the Creation Magazine.\n \n There are also two other predictions that I would like to include in this post, one of those is the fact that \"the Earth is suspended in space without support\" (Job 26:7). You maybe wondering \"Why have I chosen this point to expand on?\" It is this point on which the Bible \"scores another one\" over other religious books around the world. Did you know that of those religions that talked about the Earth and it's foundations/support (except from the Bible) say that there is something under the Earth supporting it up, for example, I think that the Indian's believed that there was/is a ginormous elephant supporting the Earth from underneath (I am not entirely sure, but if I am wrong I will just drop a note and I'll try and edit this post), while the ancient Greeks believed that there was a person underneath the world supporting the Earth on his back or what have you. Many other religions that dare to comment on this point also say that there is some other animal under the Earth supporting it. When Apollo 11 landed on the Moon in July 1969 and looked back to Earth, did they see a massive elephant or some other creature under it supporting it? Of course not! What they did see, however, is exactly what Job 26:7 said they would see, \"and [God] hung the Earth in empty space\", i.e. nothing was under the Earth but space. Here is the thing, if I can't trust other religions in things that I can test and observe, then why should I trust them in areas that I can't observe and test and require blind faith to believe?\n \n The other verse that I quickly wanted to bring up was the statement brought up in Job 38:31, which says, \"Can you [God to Job] tie the Pleiades together or loosen the bonds that hold Orion?\" This verse has been scientificially proven to be accuract and correct. The stars that make up the star group known as Pleiades, or the M-45 star cluster, are in fact staying together as a group; while the famous Hunter or Orion star group is infact breaking up, i.e. the stars that make up Orion are moving away from eachother. It has been predicted that in several thousand years there will be no Orion group in the sky. The question that I have is how could Job have known this? Whenever I go out at night and take a look at the stars, Orion looks the same nearly 8 years ago when I started looking up as they do today. Besides, Job had his plate pretty much full as at this time Job had been going through a tough and trying time. He lost nearly everything in one day, and later on he ended up having a terrible disease (caused by the devil). \n \n So there is no logical way that Job could have known either or the two facts that is represented in Job (listed above) as for one, he would have had too much to worry about rather than look at the stars. Many scientists following Job's era and the ancient Greek scientists wouldn't have known these facts. In fact, up to the 1500's people thought that the world was flat, when nearly 3000 years before that in the time of Isaiah the Bible says that the Earth is round (not in exact words) in Isa. 40:22.\n \n Some historic predictions: other than the fact that the Old Testament is basically the Israeli's history, we have the fact that many reknown historians have commented on the amazing historical accuracy of the Bible. For instance, Nelson Glueck, famous Jewish archaeologist, spoke of what he called \"the almost incredibly accurate historical memory of the Bible, and particularly so when it is fortified by archaeological fact. William F. Albright, widely recognised as one of the great archaeologists, stated: \"The excessive scepticism shown towards the Bible by important historical schools of the 18th and 19th centuries, certain phases which still appear periodically, has been progressively discredited. Discovery after discovery has established the accuracy of innumerable details, and has brought increased recognition to the Bible as a source of history.\" There have been many occasions where septics have questioned the Bible's accuracy only to find that further archaeological discoveries have unearthed evidence for the Biblical account.\n \n Also, there are many propheticly accurate verses in the Bible for which one will search in vain for one line of accurate prophecy in other religious books. Josh McDowell, in his book \"Evidence that Demands a Verdict\" documents 61 prophecies regarding Jesus alone. Many of these, such as His place, time, and manner of birth, betrayal, death, burial, etc., were beyond His control. Many of these prophecies were made hundreds of years before Jesus was born. McDowell also documents 12detailed, specific prophecies regarding Tyre, Sidon, Samaria, Gaza, Babylon, Jerusalem, Palestine and others.\n \n Once again, sorry about the time taken to respond...",

The Orion quote seems valid, so I'm not gonna argue with that one. Your Isaiah reference does say that the earth is a circle, 'course it also says in that same verse that Earth's peoples are like grasshoppers, I'm not sure how to interpret that but that is part of the verse. \n You also included some messianic prophecies, but you didn't include the possibility that Jesus's story could have been tailored to fit the prophecies.\n Thank you for taking the time to respond.",

   "Good point SirGladius!\n I found the verses you cited and I can't deny that they are convincing, but Job 26:7 says \"He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; He suspends the earth over nothing\", I take this as saying that God holds up the earth not that the earth has no supports, but that's probably just a difference in interpretation. \n \n This is where you have to have a little pre-knowledge of firstly how the book of Job was written for us to understand the verses in Job. Firstly to Job, at the start of the book of Job there is an introduction in where the book of Job is explained. I have the \"Good News Bible\" version and in this introduction it says:\n \"...Then in three series of poetic dialogues the author shows how Job's friends and Job himself react to these calamities.......God does not give an answer to Job's questions, but He does respond to Job's faith by overwhelming him with a poetic picture of His Divine power and wisdom.\"\n So from the statement (s) above I would like you to note the words in particular \"poetic\". Job is written in a poetic form. Now, poetry has never been my strong suit in English, but I know enough that very few things are to be taken literally and all images have different interpretations. For instance, in this year we are studying poetry by Australian poet Peter Skrzynecki - a former immigrant who moved here after WWII. Let me tell you, I hate poetry. In one of his poems that we are studying, \"Immigrants at Central Station, 1951\" in which he writes:\n \"Families stood with blankets and packed cases - keeping children by their sides, watching pigeons that watched them.\"\n I would never have thought that the pigeons are symbols of freedom, would you? Further evidence that in poetry, everything is not as it seems. \n \n Also note the language used in Job 26:7. \"He hung [or suspends] the Earth in empty space.\" (Good News Bible version). Notice that there is no reference to God still holding the Earth. It all depends on how you want to take or interpret it. When you suspend something what does that mean? The problem is the way that passages are worded in different versions. The Good News Bible makes it pretty clear that God hung the Earth in empty space. I would take it that all of the versions of the Bible, including the NIV, KJV and so on, should mean the same thing. So by following this logic, the NIV phrase \"suspends\" has the same meaning as the Good News Bible when it says \"hung\". \n \n I also consulted the dictionary, not that it helped much, to find a meaning of the word \"suspend\". It gave many meanings, one of which was, \"hang up\", the other was \"sustained or floating between top and bottom\". So the dictionary says to suspend is to hang up. So if we apply it to Job 26:7, \"He suspends the Earth in empty space\" can be re-interpreted to say \"He hangs the Earth in empty space\". Regardless of the wording, the verse is still in line with observation, i.e. nothing is under the Earth supporting it. It all depends on how you define the word \"suspends\" and how you interpret it.\n \n course it also says in that same verse that Earth's peoples are like grasshoppers, \n \n Once again, poetic imagary. Notice the word \"like\". This indicates a simile. This is used often in poetry to assist in describing or comparing something, usually an object or a person. One could say that their girl friend is \"like a light shinning through a dark tunnel at the end that appears to last forever\" (obviously I am not too good at poetry). Note that this is not saying that the girl friend is a light shinning through a dark tunnel (which would be a metaphor). I'm not quite sure the reference to grasshoppers means, but it is not mean't to be taken literally. The first part of the verse does not appear to be poetic, it is just a statement. \"He sits enthroned above the circle of the Earth.\" There are no similes to suggest that this is not meant to be taken literally. On the otherhand, the first part of the verse may be saying that God is above His creation? But there is certainly no reason to believe that the circle of the Earth part was not meant to be taken literally. Once again, either way this verse also fits in perfectly with observational fact.\n \n You also included some messianic prophecies, but you didn't include the possibility that Jesus's story could have been tailored to fit the prophecies. \n \n I guess, if you were a bit of a conspiracy theorist. But the prophecies were made nearly 1,600 years before Jesus ever walked on Earth. Also, would the Apostles have even known about the prophecies nearly 1,600 years before their time? Because I was brought up in the Chruch all of my life, I couldn't imagine how or why anyone would want to do such a thing. If they were to do it, they would be the biggest fools to ever walk the Earth, and I for following in them. I guess there may be a slight chance, but neither you nor I can prove it to be right or wrong.\n \n Thank you for taking the time to respond. \n \n No problem. You raised some pretty good questions.",

   "My question is mainly for Christians, but it's relevant to all religions with recorded scriptures. Why do you believe that the scriptures are the word of your god. Most (if not all) scriptures are centuries old. Isn't there the slightest possibility that humans have changed what they say? I know for a fact that the Roman Catholic church has changed the bible. I've brought this up in discussions that I've had with others, and I always get the question: \"why would someone do that?\" the answer to that question is obvious (at least to me it is): Religion is the easiest method to control large groups of people. Think about it: which would be easier having your military or police use force to control the masses or having your clerics and religious leaders condemn certain actions as sacrilege? The latter of course. Rulers have used this strategy for thousands of years. So how can you believe that your scriptures are pure and perfect? It seems to me that religion is more about faith in humanity than faith in the Divine.\n\n \n Sir Gladius:\n \n The problem with your social control argument is that the religion of christianity was not started by rulers and kings. It was started by fishermen, uneducated farmers, tax collectors, prostitutes etc. The idea of it begun as a method of social control is ludricous in view of its actual beginnings. Check your gospel accounts and see who these people were. \n \n You will also note that many of them do not advocate the keeping of the jewish law and actually fight against it. \n \n Now, in the future some of those in power may have used it as a form of social control, that does not mean that it started that way or that was its intended purpose.",

   "Though it didn't start out as a system of control that's what it has evolved in to.\n\n \n While you are quite correct, to a degree, you miss the point of my argument. I don't think I was answering your question directly. I was instead pointing out that while religion may have developed into a form of social control over time, that does not invalidate the relevance or meaning of scripture.\n \n The biblical references occur far far before there were the social control issues. Probably the biggest evolved social control issue is that of sexuality. The early church was big on sexually appropriate behavior. This is true before written doctrines were formulated by any organized religion. However, it was not for social control as the christians at that time were not in power, in fact were being highly persecuted. The Roman authorities of the time required people believed to be christians to worship roman gods. There were two big sins that the early church watched, idol worship and sexuality. \n \n Worshipping Roman gods required idol worship and sexual behavior (not all gods but many of them). Due to the persecutions, those that engaged in this behavior would have likely been considered enemies, simply because it was a good indicator that the person might turn them in as christians. Christianity was illegal at the time and it would cost a believer their life if they did not worship roman gods. There are records of christians being fed to lions, cooked on a hot griddle, forcing them into pots of water and slowly increasing the temperature till they were boiled alive, flaying them (removial of skin) while alive, crucifixion, disembowelment, fed to ants and other animals, burned at the stake, etc. All of these without denying their faith. Many did deny their faith and engaged in sexual behaviors and idol worship. This is why christians were afraid of them and why those particular behaviors recieved a great deal of attention.\n \n It is possible that the original reason for this was forgotten and those items were still majored on as the church developed. However, the roman catholic church is not the only church any more. Many churches do not engage in social control.\n \n In any case, I believe the scriptures as a matter of faith. They have never let me down in my 10 years as a believer. God has not either. He continues to provide for me in ways I do not understand completely. Your choice to believe or not believe is, of course, a matter of faith. I wish you well.",
