   "You're funnyemoticon_xbye\n\n Simone may be very greatly exaggerating, but there is a point to be made that conservatives, on average, tend to have much less agreement that society should carry responsibility for their poor than do liberals. Conservatives (at least of the religious sort) often do give more personal charity toward the poor and other issues. However, they are far less supportive of government programs for the poor. \n \n Though I applaud any efforts people make at charity, charity can in no way substitute for government help. In 2008, total US charitable giving was estimated at around $300 billion (from http://www.philanthropy.iupui.edu/News/2009/docs/GivingReaches300billion_06102009.pdf ). This is a drop in the bucket compared to the amounts that the US government gives for supporting seniors in Social Security and Medicare payments (where most seniors get more from the government than they ever put in from Social Security and Medicare taxes) and the disabled. Without such programs, which themselves were once criticized as \"Socialist\" since they do redistribute wealth, personal charity would certainly not pick up the slack.\n \n The bottom line is that government is the only institution that can adequately help out the poor and lower middle class by, essentially, taxing the rich and upper middle class more than it gives them back in services. Is this wealth redistribution? Yes, to a small degree. The US government has been redistributing wealth since its very founding since US citizens never paid an equal amount of taxes. Early taxes were often levied on property (which is not equally distributed so it is not equally taxed). Abraham Lincoln, a president that Republicans are justifiably proud of, was one of the first presidents to introduce a progressive income tax (two tax brackets, as I recall) which, again, unequally distributed the tax burden, thereby \"redistributing wealth\".\n \n Anyway, I suspect that most Republicans / conservatives do agree that government should play some role in social support. It is mainly a matter of degree.",

   "Because I asked how do we know these entitlement programs are helping. Asking what to do in its place is a different discussion. If one option is nothing and the other is to do something you can't afford you really have been left with nothing.\n\n I think it is obvious how those programs are helping. Namely, for those poorer seniors that cannot afford to support themselves otherwise and cannot afford to pay for private health insurance to support their increasingly large health expenses, Social Security and Medicare pay for that with costs that mostly come out of someone else's pockets - i.e. mainly from the upper middle class to rich. \n \n Sustainability is another question. When Social Security was first started, the average life expectancy was much lower - even below 65 - so it was much easier for it to stay solvent. The main problems with Social Security sustainability is that we expected it to pay for more and more services (i.e. pay for much longer retirements as life expectancy increased) without increasing the SS tax enough to support that. Also, in trying to spend beyond our means, we forced the government to borrow money from the SS trust fund that could have seen us through the baby boom retirements. However, these problems are not non-reversable. They simply require somewhat politically painful steps that include any of : raising SS taxes (or extending them to higher income brackets), raising the retirement age, reducing the increase in SS payments, etc. \n \n As for Medicare, I think that there is no way around the requirement that care be rationed to some degree to prevent un-necessary procedures that people often ask for. Yes, I do not like the idea of rationing, but Private insurers do it all the time - and this mainly for reasons of making more profit. I would rather have a government beaurocrat rationing than an insurance administrator. At least the government beaurocrat is not trying to make a profit off of denying coverage.\n \nIt worked for a long time. Even after social security and medicare came about not many people used it! It's like financial aid...the more you give the more tuition goes up thus the more financial aid you need. It's crazy!\n\n I don't know why you would say that things worked fine for poor seniors before SS and Medicare. Things were clearly worse for poor seniors before SS was introduced. Though some states did have versions of SS before the federal one was introduced, many didn't. In general, far more seniors either worked until they died (which itself happened on average at a much younger age), moved in with their children to be supported by them, or, in worst case, ended up in community sponsored poor houses together with others (orphans, mentally ill, etc.). The idea of a retirement of ease was way out of reach for the great majority of poor seniors. See: PRX Transcripts Show .",

   "I like a hybrid of option 1. I&#8217;d like to see a private, charity-run solution that is partially governmentally-subsidized as an interim step towards weaning the American public from governmental largesse.\n\n The main problem with any hybrid solution or final private solution is the amount of money that would go to the poor seniors. As I stated in another post, the TOTAL amount of charity that Americans give per year is around $300 billion and that goes to a wide range of charities where only a fraction goes to the poor. I just don't see Americans increasing that by a factor of three to make up for the loss of the government programs like Social Security or Medicare. People are simply not that generous. The government is the only organization that can force people to pay for such subsidies of the poor. I can't see how a private-only solution could supply the necessary funds.\n \nIn retrospect, the GI Education Bill was one of the best investments that Uncle Sam ever made. As a result, I&#8217;m in favor of zero interest student loans as long as they have better safeguards against default. \n\n The GI bill certainly was a good social program. In some ways, it was easier for a large number of people to accept because it went to those that were thought \"deserving\" since the funds did go to veterans who either risked their lives for the US or were at least ready to risk their lives when called upon. I suspect that a major obstacle to social programs today is that many of the poor receiving aid are not thought of as \"deserving\" by large portions of the population. \n \n I have mixed feelings where that is concerned. I have great sympathy for the working poor that are responsible and hard working but have great trouble making ends meet because their life circumstances led to lack of education and other benefits that would have let them have better paying jobs. I would consider the working poor \"deserving\", as well as those that do not work because of circumstances beyond their control (the handycapped, mentally ill, etc.). However, among the poor that one does have sympathy for are also poor that simply are lazy and irresponsible. I certainly do not think that the government should supply them with a comfortable living but do feel responsible enough even for them to think that they deserve at least some minimal sustaining food (bread lines) and housing (dormitory beds). \n \nSocial Security is an off-budget item. Medicare used to be an off-budget item as well, but is now on-budget. Regardless, we need to cut spending, not burden the &#8220;haves&#8221; with additional costs of supporting the &#8220;have-nots&#8221;. It amazes me how everyone screams about the separation of Church and State but clamor for institutionally-mandated charity!!\n\n Charity is not something that is defined purely religiously. After all, the Soviet Union was atheist and it had the highest degree of wealth redistribution that I know of - far too much (leading to no incentive for people to try harder). Too much wealth redistribution is equally bad to too little wealth redistribution.\n \n If there is no or negligible wealth redistribution and one pays too poorly for the menial work that a great many people do, then that just leads to political instability. Historically speaking, governments started forcing the \"haves\" to subsidize the \"have nots\" because of such instabilities. As a \"have\" (not rich, but upper middle class in my salary), I feel a responsibility to give to the \"have nots\" mostly out of a sense that properly functioning civilizations bear such responsibilities, partly from simple personal compassion, and partly because of the consequences to national stability if there was no such support.\n \nIt&#8217;s easy to argue that the poor benefit MORE from governmental programs than the wealthy, so the reality is that the wealthy are paying for services that they will NEVER get, but ones that the poor get for free. In a truly-free society, all should be equally burdened with the costs of running the government. IMO, if you can&#8217;t pay your fair share in cash, you should have to do so in labor.\n Imagine the philosophical metamorphosis that would take place in the country as poor liberals, faced with ever-increasing public servitude to support progressivism, begin to become Conservatives and lobby for a smaller government. ;)\n\n The countries of Europe experienced for themselves what revolutions happen when you deny the poor those subsidies. Again, even from a purely selfish point of view, it is in the interest of the \"haves\" to support the \"have nots\" enough to prevent that political instability. Also, the \"haves\" make their money not purely from their own effort but largely by greatly benefiting from the efforts of the \"have nots\" - the menial workers who are so often underpaid for their work - and they are taking a larger and larger piece of the pie without adding any extra benefit. CEOs in the 70s used to earn about 60 times that of the average worker. Now, it is closer to 300 times more. Did the CEOs suddenly become more brilliant, work much harder, or in any other way deserve that tremendous increase? Essentially, wealth redistribution would not be necessary if the original distribution was more equitable.",

   "I think it is obvious how those programs are helping.\nNo it is not. We haven't seen poverty change as a result of them and they obviously haven't helped retirement situations since you are basically in poverty if you live off social security and health care costs are not all covered by Medicare. We went close to 200 years without these programs and after we had them nothing changed but our deficit and unfunded liabilities.\n \n \nNamely, for those poorer seniors that cannot afford to support themselves otherwise and cannot afford to pay for private health insurance to support their increasingly large health expenses, Social Security and Medicare pay for that with costs that mostly come out of someone else's pockets - i.e. mainly from the upper middle class to rich. \nA relevance on it now doesn't speak to its need much like addiction is heroin doesn't speak to the usefulness or need for heroin. I'm not stupid enough to think you could go cold turkey without causing a revolt but clearly the way we are doing it now is not working.\n \n \nHowever, these problems are not non-reversable. They simply require somewhat politically painful steps that include any of : raising SS taxes (or extending them to higher income brackets), raising the retirement age, reducing the increase in SS payments, etc. \nOr cutting out social security altogether. Clearly the government has been shown to be incapable of running a simple pension program. Why trust them with another one or think we can fix this one? It is not wise policy to have the government worry about being responsible for you. \n \n \nAs for Medicare, I think that there is no way around the requirement that care be rationed to some degree to prevent un-necessary procedures that people often ask for. Yes, I do not like the idea of rationing, but Private insurers do it all the time - and this mainly for reasons of making more profit.\nPrivate doesn't ration by any reasonable definition of the word. \n \n \nI would rather have a government beaurocrat rationing than an insurance administrator. At least the government beaurocrat is not trying to make a profit off of denying coverage.\nAnd they also have no way of knowing what is too little or too much. With a system where you have money involved you can make the decision if getting a CAT scan every year is worth the cost while a government bureaucrat might say everyone gets a CAT scan because it detects more brain tumors or they might say no one gets a CAT scan unless you have x,y,z symptoms of a brain tumor. There is no rational basis for what the bureaucrat decides. This is exactly how it panned out in the UK. \n \n You basically narrowed this conversation down to whether you want to make decisions about care or do you want government to handle that, retirement, etc for you? It is obvious to me which one works better.\n \n \n \nI don't know why you would say that things worked fine for poor seniors before SS and Medicare. Things were clearly worse for poor seniors before SS was introduced.\n I haven't seen any data to show social security changed anything but our debt. Your link is a story..not proof. Even you admit many people didn't benefit from social security right away and as more people were covered we didn't see any social benefit that justified the cost...including the costs associated with using that now 12.4% for other purposes.",

   "I think it is obvious how those programs are helping. Namely, for those poorer seniors that cannot afford to support themselves otherwise and cannot afford to pay for private health insurance to support their increasingly large health expenses, Social Security and Medicare pay for that with costs that mostly come out of someone else's pockets - i.e. mainly from the upper middle class to rich. \n\n \n Robin Hood (with the emphasis on HOOD).\n \n\n Sustainability is another question. When Social Security was first started, the average life expectancy was much lower - even below 65 - so it was much easier for it to stay solvent. The main problems with Social Security sustainability is that we expected it to pay for more and more services (i.e. pay for much longer retirements as life expectancy increased) without increasing the SS tax enough to support that. Also, in trying to spend beyond our means, we forced the government to borrow money from the SS trust fund that could have seen us through the baby boom retirements. However, these problems are not non-reversable. They simply require somewhat politically painful steps that include any of : raising SS taxes (or extending them to higher income brackets), raising the retirement age, reducing the increase in SS payments, etc. \n \n\n Another Robin Hoodlum suggestion.\n \n\n As for Medicare, I think that there is no way around the requirement that care be rationed to some degree to prevent un-necessary procedures that people often ask for. Yes, I do not like the idea of rationing, but Private insurers do it all the time - and this mainly for reasons of making more profit. I would rather have a government beaurocrat rationing than an insurance administrator. At least the government beaurocrat is not trying to make a profit off of denying coverage.\n \n\n No, the bureaucrat is just typically to inept to do his job. I'd rather go with the professional.\n \n\n I don't know why you would say that things worked fine for poor seniors before SS and Medicare. Things were clearly worse for poor seniors before SS was introduced. Though some states did have versions of SS before the federal one was introduced, many didn't. In general, far more seniors either worked until they died (which itself happened on average at a much younger age), moved in with their children to be supported by them, or, in worst case, ended up in community sponsored poor houses together with others (orphans, mentally ill, etc.). The idea of a retirement of ease was way out of reach for the great majority of poor seniors. See: PRX Transcripts Show .\n\n I would say that your paragraph above outlined why things worked better for senior before SS and Medicare. Families stayed together. The elderly kept active and productive instead of sitting on their fat arses in Florida feeling sorry for themselves and turning into hypochondriacs. Those that did retire did so by saving their own money, using company-run pensions or other non-governmental means, and remained on their family land. They believed in self-sufficiency.\n Contrast that with today's retiree that is fully-dependant on the government to provide for their retirement and healthcare and votes as a block for every single social program that liberals can dream up as long as it's their children and children's children that have to pick up the tab. (If it sounds like I'm anti-senior, I am. That's why I will NEVER join the socialist organization called AARP. The bloodsucking bast@#ds don't give a damn about anybody by their own no matter what effect it has on future generations.)",

   "The main problem with any hybrid solution or final private solution is the amount of money that would go to the poor seniors. As I stated in another post, the TOTAL amount of charity that Americans give per year is around $300 billion and that goes to a wide range of charities where only a fraction goes to the poor. I just don't see Americans increasing that by a factor of three to make up for the loss of the government programs like Social Security or Medicare. People are simply not that generous. The government is the only organization that can force people to pay for such subsidies of the poor. I can't see how a private-only solution could supply the necessary funds.\n\n \n The ultimate goal would be to force self-sufficiency. If we wean the public off of the governmental teat, we can begin to reverse the thinking of the American public. Instead of Uncle Sam paying for Aunt Sally to retire to Florida and get a free scooter from the Scooter Store on YOUR dime, we should begin thinking that Aunt Sally should be living with her kids and enjoy a symbiotic relationship. The most compassionate societies in the world are those in which multi-generational households exist. The US used to emulate this practice until it became too easy for us to pawn our elderly off onto Uncle Sam. \n \n\n The GI bill certainly was a good social program. In some ways, it was easier for a large number of people to accept because it went to those that were thought \"deserving\" since the funds did go to veterans who either risked their lives for the US or were at least ready to risk their lives when called upon. I suspect that a major obstacle to social programs today is that many of the poor receiving aid are not thought of as \"deserving\" by large portions of the population. \n \n\n \n The \"deserving\" part should be borne out after graduation when they become productive, tax-paying citizens. I don't think it would take much to get the public to understand that, do you?\n \n\n I have mixed feelings where that is concerned. I have great sympathy for the working poor that are responsible and hard working but have great trouble making ends meet because their life circumstances led to lack of education and other benefits that would have let them have better paying jobs. I would consider the working poor \"deserving\", as well as those that do not work because of circumstances beyond their control (the handycapped, mentally ill, etc.). However, among the poor that one does have sympathy for are also poor that simply are lazy and irresponsible. I certainly do not think that the government should supply them with a comfortable living but do feel responsible enough even for them to think that they deserve at least some minimal sustaining food (bread lines) and housing (dormitory beds). \n\n \n IMO, social safety nets for the able-bodied should be minimal and meet only basic requirements, food and shelter. I do believe that a civilized country has more responsibility to the handicapped, mentally ill or otherwise disabled person, providing thet their disability isn't self-inflicted such as alcoholism or drug addiction. \n \n\n Charity is not something that is defined purely religiously. After all, the Soviet Union was atheist and it had the highest degree of wealth redistribution that I know of - far too much (leading to no incentive for people to try harder). Too much wealth redistribution is equally bad to too little wealth redistribution.\n \n\n I agree that charity isn't purely religious, but the most efficient delivery systems for human services are typically religious charities staffed with volunteers, not paid bureaucrats. And, IMO, wealth redistribution should never be coerced. It should be voluntary.\n \n\n If there is no or negligible wealth redistribution and one pays too poorly for the menial work that a great many people do, then that just leads to political instability. Historically speaking, governments started forcing the \"haves\" to subsidize the \"have nots\" because of such instabilities.

That said, I also view it as a personal moral imperative, not one that should be foisted on everyone. \n \n\n The countries of Europe experienced for themselves what revolutions happen when you deny the poor those subsidies. Again, even from a purely selfish point of view, it is in the interest of the \"haves\" to support the \"have nots\" enough to prevent that political instability. Also, the \"haves\" make their money not purely from their own effort but largely by greatly benefiting from the efforts of the \"have nots\" - the menial workers who are so often underpaid for their work - and they are taking a larger and larger piece of the pie without adding any extra benefit. CEOs in the 70s used to earn about 60 times that of the average worker. Now, it is closer to 300 times more. Did the CEOs suddenly become more brilliant, work much harder, or in any other way deserve that tremendous increase? Essentially, wealth redistribution would not be necessary if the original distribution was more equitable.\n\n Unquestionably, CEO salaries have ballooned beyond the value of the job. IMO, reform needs to occur at the shareholder level. Shareholders need more access and control over boardroom activities. Big companies have become \"Good Ole Boys Clubs\" partly because of the cross-breeding that occurs on BODs. For example Jack is President of Company X and also on the BOD for Company Y. His buddy is president of Company Y and on the BOD for Jack's Company X. How do you think Jack and his buddy will vote on executive compensation for each other, knowing that the money isn't coming from their pocket?\n Shareholders should be able to review compensation proposals for Execs and vote on them directly. That would sever the link between Jack and his buddy WRT compensation and lead, I believe, to more realistic pay for Execs. \n Here's a start: Shareholders to Focus on Executive Compensation - WSJ.com",

We went close to 200 years without these programs and after we had them nothing changed but our deficit and unfunded liabilities.\n\n The goal of Social Security was not to bring poor workers into the Middle Class once they reached retirement. Such a goal would always have been financially too challenging. The goal was to limit how bad that poverty was. After all, there is poverty, and then there is POVERTY. Having a senior pre-Social Security living in a poor house and dying with minimal care (apart from what their family or volunteers could give them in nursing care) from the first major illness that came along was a lot more dire a situation than having a senior living in a relatively cheap apartment and being cared for by Medicare when they get sick. Both those scenarios show seniors that are below the poverty line but they show life experiences that are tremendously different.\n \nA relevance on it now doesn't speak to its need much like addiction is heroin doesn't speak to the usefulness or need for heroin. I'm not stupid enough to think you could go cold turkey without causing a revolt but clearly the way we are doing it now is not working.\n\n But you don't offer an alternative to head to in a transition. You seem to be suggesting dropping the government run programs (perhaps then not \"cold turkey\" but more slowly) with nothing to replace them with so poor seniors would be left to the same miseries that they were in prior to Social Security. If I am wrong about this and you indeed do have an non-government alternative in mind, then please state it. \n \nOr cutting out social security altogether. Clearly the government has been shown to be incapable of running a simple pension program. Why trust them with another one or think we can fix this one? It is not wise policy to have the government worry about being responsible for you. \n\n Social Security worked fine for the great majority of a century. I would hardly call that an inherently failed system. The only reason it is in trouble now is because we, the people, want to have more benefits without paying for them - more benefits in terms of SS and Medicare support extending to later and later years as life expectancy increases, while we are not willing to pay for those increased costs with taxes. If we make the logical but painful political decisions of paying for those extra benefits or reducing them to sustainable levels, the Social Security would do just fine. \n \n Some of my friends think that they will never get Social Security once they retire. However, the political decision to cut Social Security all together would be FAR FAR more of a political suicide for politicians than to simply reform it, so I disagree with them. Politicians have tried to reform SS in bits and pieces (ex. I cannot officially retire until 67) but they will clearly have to do more in the years ahead. Faced with the choice of reforming SS or getting rid of it, I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that politicians will eventually take those painful reforming steps.\n \n \nPrivate doesn't ration by any reasonable definition of the word. \n\n What do you call it when claims are denied - which they very often are? I would prefer to know ahead of time about the limitations of my health insurance and to occasionally have to wait than to undergo a necessary procedure and then find out that I have to pay out of pocket because the insurance company denied it for a bogus reason. \n \nAnd they also have no way of knowing what is too little or too much. With a system where you have money involved you can make the decision if getting a CAT scan every year is worth the cost while a government bureaucrat might say everyone gets a CAT scan because it detects more brain tumors or they might say no one gets a CAT scan unless you have x,y,z symptoms of a brain tumor.

It is obvious to me which one works better.\n\n Private insurance works fine in the US until you get seriously sick. Then, many unscrupulous insurance companies will either drop their now sick clients under twisted arguments of marginally related pre-existing conditions, or deny claim after claim until they tire out all but the most strong-minded of patients. No, not all insurance companies are unscrupulous, but enough of them are that those without the highest level of health insurance often feel vulnerable. I would rather have a basic but guaranteed health package (be it government run or at least strongly government regulated for fraud) and potentially add supplemental private insurance (as some of the wealthier in European countries do) to get the better service, than to have service I cannot rely on. It is highly important for me to be able to have the peace of mind of knowing that my health care will be taken care of financially and that I won't be left out in the cold because of a twisted argument of an insurance beaurocrat. Some of the new legislation is meant to address these concerns (denial for pre-existing conditions, or dropping sick patients). We'll see how well the legislation works in this regard. If I can be confident that I can rely on my health insurance under all circumstances and that their premiums are not substantially higher than what the government would charge if it were running it, then I would be happy having a purely private health insurance system for decades to come. Currently, I do not have that confidence.\n \n I haven't seen any data to show social security changed anything but our debt. Your link is a story..not proof.

If we make the logical but painful political decisions of paying for those extra benefits or reducing them to sustainable levels, the Social Security would do just fine. \nWell of course it would be. We could actually expand benefits and raise taxes and be fine. My point is there is no point in doing it this way since having government run this program doesn't seem to help anything but it does give the federal government one more thing to manipulate, which is what they did, and cause one generation to basically pay for the other. As we stand, one generation is going to get the shaft which is 100% unfair but needed. Such is life when the federal government sees a penny.\n \n \nSome of my friends think that they will never get Social Security once they retire. However, the political decision to cut Social Security all together would be FAR FAR more of a political suicide for politicians than to simply reform it, so I disagree with them.\nYeah this is true but reforming it is almost as bad as Bush found out. People freak too much. So it might end up coming down to the point where we can't do anything else until we reform social security and by that point the reform might be many people not receiving the benefits.\n \n \nI have absolutely no doubt in my mind that politicians will eventually take those painful reforming steps.\nNeither do I..but will be awhile for actual reform and the longer you go the more painful it is. If we did this in the lat 90s early 2000s it woulda stunk but we'd be better off today. \n \n \nWhat do you call it when claims are denied &#8211; which they very often are?\nA denial. Rationing implies limited quantity of a good. If I go into the store for bread and they have one loaf and 10 people want it so they split it up..that is rationing. If I go in and can't afford it...that is a denial. There is a huge difference. \n \n \nI would prefer to know ahead of time about the limitations of my health insurance and to occasionally have to wait than to undergo a necessary procedure and then find out that I have to pay out of pocket because the insurance company denied it for a bogus reason. \nIt is rare they denied for a bogus reason. \n \n \nPrivate insurance works fine in the US until you get seriously sick. Then, many unscrupulous insurance companies will either drop their now sick clients under twisted arguments of marginally related pre-existing conditions, or deny claim after claim until they tire out all but the most strong-minded of patients.\n BS. First off, if you are with employer based health care (which most with insurance are) then you won't get kicked off. Second, even with your own insurance this was extremely rare. Come on now...I hate this debate and destroyed Foundit66 on it. I'm not saying it doesn't happen..every company does things like that but it without a doubt is not the norm.\n \n \nNo, not all insurance companies are unscrupulous, but enough of them are that those without the highest level of health insurance often feel vulnerable.\nBack it up with facts...you will find this just isn't true.\n \n \n I won&#8217;t be left out in the cold because of a twisted argument of an insurance beaurocrat. \nYou know Medicare denies lots of coverage too right? In fact, in Massachusetts (with their care), they denied more than the private companies did! Ohh geesh, out of all the arguments...I just can't see this one as credible at all.\n \n \nThe difference was in the degree of poverty and misery that poor seniors experienced before and after SS was introduced. \nThen this should be easy to show...

The bloodsucking bast@#ds don't give a damn about anybody by their own no matter what effect it has on future generations.)\n\n I don't see a situation of seniors working from financial necessity until they drop dead as one which our country should strive for. I think that people who have worked hard all of their lives deserve some rest once they get older and weaker. I would expect that for myself and, following the golden rule of \"do unto others...\", I am willing to fund that for the current generation of seniors. It is a sense of community responsibility. \n \n Also, yes, many families could hypothetically take in a senior to live with them but, first, that excludes all of the seniors that don't have that option (either didn't have kids or had kids that cannot take them in) and, second, far fewer women are stay at home housewives who could care for these seniors, so the seniors would not have anyone to care for them the way they used to in the early 20th century before SS. Also, I have seen for myself many examples where seniors who are supported by family are often shown disrespect or are otherwise treated like dependent children. The social structure in the US has changed far too much to accommodate a change as drastic as having seniors all be supported by children. Also, a senior does not have to be supported by a family to be close to their family. Indeed, not being in the situation of being completely dependent and being treated like a dependent child would yield a better relationship of elder to family. From my experience, the elders that were complete dependents were far less happy and had generally worse relationships with their families than the elders who supported themselves (retirement funds and SS) and still maintained relations with their families. The stress should be on keeping the elders emotionally close to the family, not on keeping those elders dependent and helpless. Dependent helplessness is not the best model for family closeness.\n \nThe \"deserving\" part should be borne out after graduation when they become productive, tax-paying citizens. I don't think it would take much to get the public to understand that, do you?\n IMO, social safety nets for the able-bodied should be minimal and meet only basic requirements, food and shelter. I do believe that a civilized country has more responsibility to the handicapped, mentally ill or otherwise disabled person, providing thet their disability isn't self-inflicted such as alcoholism or drug addiction.\n\n I do understand your point about \"deserving\" meaning becoming productive, tax-paying citizens and partly agree with it. For me, \"deserving\" would have multiple considerations. Even for those who will never become productive with the money donated to them (ex. the mentally ill or sufficiently handicapped), I would still consider them deserving and donate money purely out of a sense of compassion and a hope that I too would be supported if the worst case scenario happened (ex. a horrible accident that left me brain damaged). I also think that those who were disenfranchised in life should get a helping hand to improve their opportunities through education, etc. and to allow for a minimum life safety net (food, shelter, and at least moderate health care). If they don't take advantage of the opportunities, then it is their own fault but I would agree that one would only fund opportunities for those who are \"deserving\" from your point of view of having a reasonable probability that they would take advantage of the opportunities to grow and become productive, tax- paying citizens, and not waste those opportunities. I would say that the same would be true of the able bodied poor that do not work. I would only pay for opportunities for them through taxes if they show signs of potential. Too many times, the government does throw money at a problem without carefully screening how that money is used.\n \n I agree that charity isn't purely religious, but the most efficient delivery systems for human services are typically religious charities staffed with volunteers, not paid bureaucrats. And, IMO, wealth redistribution should never be coerced. It should be voluntary.\n I believe that to some degree, we are our brother's keeper. That said, I also view it as a personal moral imperative, not one that should be foisted on everyone. \n\n For me, it is important to look at the purpose of the charity. When I give charity, my main goal is to see that those who receive my charity get a better life. Of course, I feel good about myself and get a sense of worth and achievement of social responsibility from giving charity but that shouldn't be the main purpose of giving it. It should be about the good it does for the recipient, not about the good result for ourselves. It is very clear to me from the actual dollar amounts that people in the US give that charity is not sufficient for supporting the poor in the US in anything above an average miserable existence. That is why I think it is a societal responsibility. We take for granted all of the menial work of others that helps us in our lives - menial work that is grossely under-paid in that full-time menial work can barely support one person, much less a family, even with a shared income. Also, with the losses of the unskilled manufacturing jobs over the last decades, that leaves fewer jobs for the uneducated and fewer paths to growth for the poor. These lack of opportunities are another reason that drives my sense that societies should be responsible for helping the poor.\n \nUnquestionably, CEO salaries have ballooned beyond the value of the job. IMO, reform needs to occur at the shareholder level. Shareholders need more access and control over boardroom activities. Big companies have become \"Good Ole Boys Clubs\" partly because of the cross-breeding that occurs on BODs. For example Jack is President of Company X and also on the BOD for Company Y. His buddy is president of Company Y and on the BOD for Jack's Company X. How do you think Jack and his buddy will vote on executive compensation for each other, knowing that the money isn't coming from their pocket?\n Shareholders should be able to review compensation proposals for Execs and vote on them directly. That would sever the link between Jack and his buddy WRT compensation and lead, I believe, to more realistic pay for Execs. \n Here's a start: Shareholders to Focus on Executive Compensation - WSJ.com\n\n I've had conversations with a moderate conservative friend of mine on this topic and we both struggled intellectually with the same problem of lack of downward pressure on CEO salaries. Yes, theoretically, shareholders could exert that downward pressure. However, nowadays, many or most companies are not supported mainly by a few individual shareholders but by many thousands - through mutual and pension funds or small scale investments. I myself own many shares that way and, I have to admit, as with the great majority of people I know who also own mutual funds, pension funds or small investments, our investments in individual companies are really too small to make us go through the trouble of doing all of the research necessary to get deeply involved in company workings - including CEO salaries. So, I don't get involved and neither does anyone else I know. It is just too much trouble. That is the problem with shareholder strength. The main feedback that most companies get from shareholders is seeing them leave (by selling shares) if the stock does not maintain short term gains. Unfortunately, I don't see any way around this, which also leaves me pessimistic about the possibility of having a force of downward pressure on CEO salaries. Perhaps a tax on companies giving ultra-high bonuses could be useful but, of course, any Republican would disagree and, either way, it would have to be well thought through.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "I haven't seen any evidence that society security ended \"miseries\" for poor seniors. 200 years existed prior to social security.\n ...\n \"Nothing\" worked for two centuries and yet you think that was flawed. \n\n What do you mean by \"worked\"? With many low level workers ending up in the poor house when they retired and not having access to any significant health care when they got seriously sick, I would hardly call that \"working\". Also, in the early 20th century and before, women were far more often stay-at-home mothers and wives who could also take care of a senior living with the family. That is far less common nowadays both since most women want to also work outside the home and since many families cannot afford not having two incomes, as they could in the past. So, the social conditions that allowed for large groups of seniors to live at home no longer exist. \n \n That addresses Social Security. Where Medicare is concerned, poor seniors simply died early prior to Medicare. However, the statistics are complicated by the fact that there were fewer medical procedures available for anyone of any class to survive serious diseases (ex. heart diseases or cancer) so people in general died earlier. Now, many more of those procedures exist but, of course, they cost money - either through direct payment or through payment of high insurance premiums - both of which are not affordable for poor seniors without the existence of Medicare or any private option of subsidization that someone (perhaps you) might propose.\n \nWell of course it would be. We could actually expand benefits and raise taxes and be fine. My point is there is no point in doing it this way since having government run this program doesn't seem to help anything but it does give the federal government one more thing to manipulate, which is what they did, and cause one generation to basically pay for the other. As we stand, one generation is going to get the shaft which is 100% unfair but needed. Such is life when the federal government sees a penny.\n\n The way Social Security works is that current working generations support the elderly and the current working generation gets compensated by getting supported themselves once they retire. It is not a pyramid scheme since it does not require a growth of the supporting working population. If the population ratio stayed the same, the system could continue indefinitely. The problem is that seniors are dying later (of course, a good think in a general sense but bad from an economic sense). However, that can be compensated for by lifting SS taxes or reducing benefits (ex. retiring later). It is only fair. After all, if I expect to get more out of SS by, on average, living longer, then I need to pay for that with increased taxes. You have to pay for any new advantage you get.\n \nYeah this is true but reforming it is almost as bad as Bush found out. People freak too much. So it might end up coming down to the point where we can't do anything else until we reform social security and by that point the reform might be many people not receiving the benefits.\n\n I suspect that it would be more a reduction in benefits than cutting people from the rosters. Where cutting people's benefits is concerned, I can imagine that one argument would be to cut higher income people off of SS. However, it makes more economic sense (and yes it does re-distribute wealth) to tax them the full percentage SS tax while giving them disproportionally small SS payments once they retire (but still higher than those paying less SS tax). \n \nNeither do I..but will be awhile for actual reform and the longer you go the more painful it is. If we did this in the late 90s early 2000s it woulda stunk but we'd be better off today. \n\n I agree. This government most often takes action when it comes to putting out the fires. It rarely takes sufficient action when things are just smoldering - as they are with Social Security. SS will become a financial fire if we don't reform it.\n \nA denial. Rationing implies limited quantity of a good. If I go into the store for bread and they have one loaf and 10 people want it so they split it up..that is rationing. If I go in and can't afford it...that is a denial. There is a huge difference. \n\n People in Europe pay for national health care as a group where they also get what they pay for but that payment is simply distributed unevenly among the group (through progressive taxes) no equally individually. Any denials within the national health care plan are also based on \"getting what you pay for\". The financially better off in Europe will often buy supplementary health insurance to get health care that is better than the national health care. \n Medicare is similar. Those on Medicare get what is paid for by all of our mutual taxes. The main difference between private and public insurance is not that one is denial and one is rationing. The main difference is simply the one who is doing the paying. I am not advocating an across-the-board national health care system. I personally simply think that should be an option for those people who cannot afford the private system - an option that is subsidized by those who are better off (including myself, as having a salary in the upper middle class).\n \nIt is rare they denied for a bogus reason. \n ...\n BS. First off, if you are with employer based health care (which most with insurance are) then you won't get kicked off. Second, even with your own insurance this was extremely rare. Come on now...I hate this debate and destroyed Foundit66 on it. I'm not saying it doesn't happen..every company does things like that but it without a doubt is not the norm.\n ...\n Back it up with facts...you will find this just isn't true.\n ...\n You know Medicare denies lots of coverage too right? In fact, in Massachusetts (with their care), they denied more than the private companies did! Ohh geesh, out of all the arguments...I just can't see this one as credible at all.\n\n I was torn between responding to these or not but I can see any response evolving into a long discussion on the pros and cons of public vs private health insurance, which is not the purpose of this thread. I would only mention the main point that, whether insurance is public or private, the poor cannot afford it without subsidies. If you deny them ANY subsidies (either through taxes or a yet-to-be-proposed private option), then you deny them healthcare (unless you want to keep the current inefficient system of hospitals treating the uninsured in emergency rooms and raising costs of a wide variety of procedures on everyone else to effectively subsidize the poor).",

   "I don't see a situation of seniors working from financial necessity until they drop dead as one which our country should strive for. I think that people who have worked hard all of their lives deserve some rest once they get older and weaker. I would expect that for myself and, following the golden rule of \"do unto others...\", I am willing to fund that for the current generation of seniors. It is a sense of community responsibility. \n\n \n I think you're missing my point. We need to change our expectations as a society from one of entitlement to one of empowerment. My neighbor's retirement should have never become MY responsibility to provide for, it should have been HIS. \n [quote]\n Also, yes, many families could hypothetically take in a senior to live with them but, first, that excludes all of the seniors that don't have that option (either didn't have kids or had kids that cannot take them in) and, second, far fewer women are stay at home housewives who could care for these seniors, so the seniors would not have anyone to care for them the way they used to in the early 20th century before SS. Also, I have seen for myself many examples where seniors who are supported by family are often shown disrespect or are otherwise treated like dependent children. The social structure in the US has changed far too much to accommodate a change as drastic as having seniors all be supported by children. Also, a senior does not have to be supported by a family to be close to their family. Indeed, not being in the situation of being completely dependent and being treated like a dependent child would yield a better relationship of elder to family. From my experience, the elders that were complete dependents were far less happy and had generally worse relationships with their families than the elders who supported themselves (retirement funds and SS) and still maintained relations with their families. The stress should be on keeping the elders emotionally close to the family, not on keeping those elders dependent and helpless. Dependent helplessness is not the best model for family closeness.\n [quote]\n I didn't say that all seniors should be supported by their children. Ideally, they'd have enough common sense to plan for their retirement on their own years in advance of their actual retirement. And if they didn't and are still physically capable of working, they should continue to do so. It's not some stranger's responsibility to insure your happy retirement. \n \n\n I do understand your point about \"deserving\" meaning becoming productive, tax-paying citizens and partly agree with it. For me, \"deserving\" would have multiple considerations. Even for those who will never become productive with the money donated to them (ex. the mentally ill or sufficiently handicapped), I would still consider them deserving and donate money purely out of a sense of compassion and a hope that I too would be supported if the worst case scenario happened (ex. a horrible accident that left me brain damaged). I also think that those who were disenfranchised in life should get a helping hand to improve their opportunities through education, etc. and to allow for a minimum life safety net (food, shelter, and at least moderate health care). If they don't take advantage of the opportunities, then it is their own fault but I would agree that one would only fund opportunities for those who are \"deserving\" from your point of view of having a reasonable probability that they would take advantage of the opportunities to grow and become productive, tax- paying citizens, and not waste those opportunities. I would say that the same would be true of the able bodied poor that do not work. I would only pay for opportunities for them through taxes if they show signs of potential. Too many times, the government does throw money at a problem without carefully screening how that money is used.\n \n\n So, we are in agreement here. I'll move on.\n \n\n For me, it is important to look at the purpose of the charity. When I give charity, my main goal is to see that those who receive my charity get a better life. Of course, I feel good about myself and get a sense of worth and achievement of social responsibility from giving charity but that shouldn't be the main purpose of giving it. It should be about the good it does for the recipient, not about the good result for ourselves. It is very clear to me from the actual dollar amounts that people in the US give that charity is not sufficient for supporting the poor in the US in anything above an average miserable existence. That is why I think it is a societal responsibility. We take for granted all of the menial work of others that helps us in our lives - menial work that is grossely under-paid in that full-time menial work can barely support one person, much less a family, even with a shared income. Also, with the losses of the unskilled manufacturing jobs over the last decades, that leaves fewer jobs for the uneducated and fewer paths to growth for the poor. These lack of opportunities are another reason that drives my sense that societies should be responsible for helping the poor.\n\n Our philosophies on charity are very similar. I give to charities that impact people, not dogs and cats or environmentalists, but rather disabled vets, cancer research, etc., Unlike you, though, I don't see the need to reward people that made bad life choices. You say that it's hard to support a family on menial labor rates. I say, why are you building a family that you can't support? Would you build a house on someone else's land? If you can't afford to have kids, DON'T. Wait until you can or not at all. I'm not resp[onsible for YOUR poor choices. (Are you seeing a theme here, yet?)\n \n\n I've had conversations with a moderate conservative friend of mine on this topic and we both struggled intellectually with the same problem of lack of downward pressure on CEO salaries.

So, what is the standard that you use? What types of improvements would have justified Social Security, in your view, if any? I am asking since I suspect that you are opposed to Social Security more on ideological grounds than on anything else. So, please give me some reference point of which issues to address. If your objection is indeed purely ideological, then I suspect that no evidence whatsoever will be sufficient for you.\n \n Meanwhile, to give some back-up even without your input: in 1934, FDR commissioned a review of the state of security of those in vulnerable positions in life - the unemployed, seniors, those with disabilities, children - and set up a Committee on Economic Security (CES) to explore these issues. Here is a quote from their report (from Social Security 1934-35 Committee on Economic Security )\n \nTHE OLD-AGE PROBLEM\n In 1930 there were 6,500,000 people over 65 years of age in this country, representing 5.4 percent of the entire population. This percentage has been increasing quite rapidly since the turn of the century and is expected to continue to increase for several decades. It is predicted, on the basis of the present population and trends, that by 1940, 6.3 percent of the population will be 65 years of age; by 1960, 9.3 percent; and by 1975, 10 percent. In 25 to 30 years the actual number of old people will have doubled, and this estimate does not take into account the possibility of a decrease in the mortality rate, which would further increase the total.\n \n No even reasonably complete data are available regarding the means of support of aged persons, and the number in receipt of some form of public charity is not definitely known. The last almshouse survey was made more than 10 years ago, and the number of people in institutions of this kind can only be approximated. There are about 700,000 people over 65 years of age on F. E. R. A. relief lists, and the present cost of the relief extended to these people has been roughly estimated at $45,000,000 per year. In addition there are a not definitely known but large number of old people in receipt of relief who are not on F. E. R. A. relief lists. All told, the number of old people now in receipt of public charity is probably in excess of 1,000,000.\n \n The number in receipt of some form of pension is much smaller. Approximately 180,000 old people, most of them over 70 years of age, are receiving pensions under the State old-age assistance laws, the average pension last year being $19.74 per month.\n \n A somewhat smaller number of the aged are receiving public retirement or veterans' pensions, for which the expenditures exceed those under the general old-age assistance laws. Approximately 150,000 aged people are in receipt of industrial and trade-union pensions, the cost of which exceeds $100,000,000 per year.\n \n The number of the aged without means of self-support is much larger than the number receiving pensions or public assistance in any form. Upon this point the available data are confined to surveys made in a few States, most of them quite a few years ago. Connecticut (1932) nod New York (1929) found that nearly 50 percent of their aged population (65 years of age and over) had an income of less than $25 per month; 34 percent in Connecticut had no income whatsoever. At this time a conservative estimate is that at least one-half of the approximately 7,500,000 people over 65 years now living are dependent.\n \n Children, friends, and relatives have borne and still carry the major cost of supporting the aged. Several of the State surveys nave disclosed that from 30 percent to 50 percent of the people over 65 years of age were being supported in this way. During the present depression, this burden has become unbearable for many of the children, with the result that the number of old people dependent upon public or private charity has greatly increased.\n The depression will inevitably increase the old-age problem of the next decades. Many children who previously supported their parents have been compelled to cease doing so, and the great majority will probably never resume this load. The depression has largely wiped out wage earners' sayings and has deprived millions of workers past middle life of their jobs, with but uncertain prospects of ever again returning to steady employment. For years there has been some tendency toward a decrease in the percentage of old people gainfully employed. Employment difficulties for middle-aged and older workers have been increasing, and there is little possibility that there will he a reversal of this trend in the near future.\n \n Men who reach 65 still have on the average 11 or 12 years of life before them; women, 15 years. A man of 65, to provide an income of $25 per month for the rest of his life (computing interest at 3 percent) must have accumulated approximately $3,300; a woman nearly $3,600. If only this amount of income is allowed to all of the people of 65 years and over, the cost of support of the aged would represent a claim upon current national production of $2,000,000,000 per year. Regardless of what may be done to improve their condition, this cost of supporting the aged will continue to increase. In another generation it will be at least double the present total.\n\n \nIt wasn't set up as a pyramid scheme but it certainly acts like one now. In any event this doesn't address what I said. It is more than obvious that you can tax or borrow enough to give whatever benefit you want out (maybe not forever). We've been over that the problem isn't simply aging population but the way social security is run furthermore, there is no evidence it was or is helping anyting...see paragraph above. \n\n Perhaps you see it as a problem with the way that Social Security is run but I never did. I view it as a problem that we have ever longer-living seniors being supported by a relatively constant population of wage-earners. In that way and in that way only it is reminiscent of a pyramid scheme but it doesn't have to be. As I said before, if the ratio of workers to seniors stayed the same and did not reduce significantly in time, the system could continue indefinitely. So for SS to remain solvent, there are various choices or combinations of choices that we can make:\n 1) Continuously increase taxes to support the ever growing burden of longer-living seniors\n 2) Increase the retirement age at which one can get SS payments \n 3) Decrease the payments given out in Social Security\n \n I would support SS reform that is a combination of these - phased in gradually (ex. do not grow SS payments as quickly as cost of living, or increase retirement age in steps). You, instead, seem to propose eliminating it entirely without substituting any other plan in its place. Either way, this may well be a purely academic point since Social Security is such an extremely popular program in the US that it has little chance of being eliminated entirely. The reality will probably be that the government will wait until the crisis is dire until it takes sufficient action which, as we had both agreed, will be worse than if it had made reforms earlier. Unfortunately, we get the political system we vote for since we have a population that is not willing to make hard choices so neither do our politicians.\n \nThey aren't better off financially. Have you been listening the the stories about Greece? \n\n You misread my comments. I did not say that Europeans are financially better off than Americans. I simply said that \"the financially better off in Europe\" (meaning the European upper classes) often buy supplementary health insurance to get better coverage than the national insurance can give them.\n \nIt never needed to go there...your claim about recission is simply wrong and misinformation kinda like the \"death panels\" was. I just wanted to clear that up. \n \n\n It is all a matter of degree. I was not saying that all insurance companies are constantly practicing this type of unjustified denial. I am simply saying that it is enough of a problem to warrant attention. The problem is more present for those that do not have larger organizations protecting them - such as one has through employer sponsored insurance or other group insurance cases. I would suspect that the great majority of people who are Middle Class and above have limited problems with insurance. However, I have heard enough anecdotal horror stories, even from Middle Class people, that I will by no means whitewash the private insurance industry in the US. The European-style national health care systems also have their anecdotal horror stories. I am still in search of a relatively objective source that has compiled statistics comparing one type of system to another, where one can judge by statistical facts, not anecdotal stories.\n \nSubsidies is not really something we do for Medicare...it goes to everyone. Furthermore, it is a little pathetic to act as if we are doing the poor a favor by offering them subsides that get them second rate health care. \n \n\n Second rate health care is better than no health care or the type of health care which the uninsured get (i.e. the status quo for the poor)\n \nI'm not about to sit here and say we should have no government involvement in health care but the bill that just passed, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security all all things that accomplish nothing to help the poor or anyone and as far as I can tell only serve to give the federal government something more to manipulate. Frankly, you haven't shown me anything to suggest otherwise.\n\n How do you think the poor would pay for medical care if not for government involvement? This new bill that passed may be far from perfect, but it at least addresses getting the poor insured.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "The average American male lives 14 years after retiring. The average woman, a few years longer, IIRC. This increased lifespan means that they are healthier when they retire. SS was instituted as a temporary plan to help those not able to work. It has been corrupted into a Federal Pension Plan for all. That was never its intent. When enacted, the average man lives only a few years after retiring.\n\n Social security was not meant to be only a temporary plan to help those not able to work. You will see that from the web site about the Committee of Economic Security that I linked for Steeeeve in my last post - where that commissioned report from the CES was essentially passed on to Congress as the selling point for the Social Security program. It was meant to address the economic insecurities of a number of groups of Americans - not only the unemployed. Besides addressing the unemployed, it also addressed seniors, the disabled and children, among others. If you read the motivations presented in that document, you will see that changing social conditions, exacerbated by the Great Depression but by no means limited to it, required new support systems for these economically vulnerable groups.\n \n Also, from reading that document, I was surprised to see how long the average senior who reached 65 would have been supported by Social Security - 11 or 12 years for men, 15 years for women (see the quote in my post to Steeeeve). I also always assumed it was fewer years but the main difference between then and now is that fewer people reached the age of 65. The increased lifespan statistics that we see have a large component of improvement due to fewer people dying in earlier age - at early childhood from diseases whose cures were relatively new or not yet discovered then; from heart disease that would claim many in Middle Age - which are now preventable with medicine (Ex. lowering cholesterol, blood thinning, etc.) or stalled with medical procedures; workplace injuries that have been limited with proper regulation, etc. \n \n \n Now, they're living almost a generation longer, getting more than they ever paid into the system and we just keep giving them more and more freebies without consideration of what will happen in the coming decades when the number of retirees exceeds the number of workers supporting them.\n Make no mistake about it, it will become a dog-eat-dog system and if young people had enough common sense, they'd start barking loudly NOW!\n\n The system is easy enough to reform - it is simply politically difficult because, as a population, we want to get services without paying for them sufficiently. At least some minor reforms have already been introduced. For example, I cannot retire with full benefits until I am 67. More of these reformations are needed to make Social Security solvent long-term. The longer we wait, the harder such reforms will be, but, unfortunately, such is the state of our politics and our national sense of responsibility.\n \n \nI don't believe in Godless governmental charity. Liberals push so hard to get religion out of the government, but turn around and embrace religion's concept of charity. They want a Godless government, give it to them. But a Godless government isn't one that practices charity, so end all social programs if you want a Godless society. \n As I've stated before, my personal charities are those in which there are true victims, not victims of their own making. Your being a poor SOB and then having 8 kids shouldn't entitle you to automatically reach in my back pocket. Losing your job, house, etc., because you're a crack addict, drunk or criminal isn't my problem. Starve F@#$er! You made the choice, live with the consequences. \n\n As we had already discussed, charity is not purely driven by religious motivations. However, if a group claims to be motivated by religion toward charity, then we expect the group to practice what they preach. Anything else is hypocrisy.\n \n Why should people in finance take a long-term view and worry about a high poverty rate when Uncle Sam will swoop in with his social safety net and rescue them? In psychological terms, a nanny government is an enabler. It allows people to make bad choices without feeling the true consequences of those choices. That's like the spouse of a drunk that keeps the drunk from hitting rock bottom so he/she never seeks help. Are we really doing them a favor? \n When LBJ initiated his \"War on Poverty\", the idea was admirable. Forty years and $7Trillion later, we know that the program was a disaster that resulted in an increase in illegitimacy, poverty, crime, drug usage, etc., Did we win the war? Hell no! WE made it worse! And we made it worse because we reduced the consequences of bad choices and actually began to reward them.\n\n Do you seriously believe that most \"haves\" - either private or corporate - would care about the poverty rate enough to make major sacrifices if there had been no government social programs? If so, then you are seriously dillusional. CEOs, in general, do not care about the poor because they only care about themselves. Only a small percentage generally have long-term vision (such as Ford who thought it useful to pay his workers enough so that they could afford to buy his cars).",
