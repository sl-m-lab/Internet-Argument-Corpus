We allowed the American populous to have as many guns as they wanted for all too long and now we are shooting ourselves in the foot, metaphorically, trying to undo the damage that's already beed done. \n The problem with gay marriage is that the we've allowed the government to regulate and officiate marriages in the first place. Granted when we kicked the Church of England out of our country and started to track and record such things which were traditionally done by the Church we had our County Recorders take over those tasks. Deaths, Marriages, Births..etc. Those things were traditionally recorded by the Church. \n Since we were still a very new country we didn't have a predominant church in this new world. Thus our government took over recording such community events. \n Now, two hundred and some odd years later, we still haven't fixed what was actually only meant to be a temporary patch. It's become a new world tradition. \n \n What we need to do is to fix this major oversight and get government out of \"traditional\" marriage altogether.\n \n Sure, the government and local authorities can and would retain the right to regulate \"legal\" contracts between couples, regardless of gender.

   "Let's look at that study shall we? First of all, any study that is based off selecting specific \"narratives\" raises the spectre of sampling bias, that is, when the study publishers either specifically select the stories of the children who appear to support their preconcieved biases, or, if the study is legitimately impartial, then the interpreters of the study cherrypicking from it to mention only the narratives that they want to hear. You are somewhat guilty of this, since you don't print all 57 of the narratives but only (with one exception) those that support your side. Two of the ten kids you cite reported sexual abuse, which is way higher than the rates of child abuse by homosexuals and would appear to affirm my suspicions of sampling bias. Furthermore, what Joe claimed his study said was that children of gay couples don't statistically do worse than those of straight couples, NOT that the children don't have any problems at all. Any statistical sampling of children is likely to come up with some who have problems. The question is whether they vary in any statistically meaningful way, and if so, why.\n \n But even taking your stories at face value and pretending their representative, they still don't do that good a job of supporting your side. Essentially, the stories can be grouped into 3 categories: Those who felt marginalized either by only being exposed to one gender or through uncomfortability at being part of an uncommon relationship, those who felt resentful towards their parents for their relationship, and those who felt their sexuality was unclear as a result of their relationship. The former is no different than what is experienced by either children of single parent families (in the former case) or interracial couples (in the latter). If people marginalize the children of interracial couples, we don't strip the couple of custody, we properly try and educate the community to remove its biases. In terms of overwhelming exposure to only one gender, again, the same methods by which single parent families can expose their children to the other gender can be used by homosexual couples (I assume that even in single-parent homes there are more other-gender role models than just whoever the parent is dating at the time). The second group, the resentful one, is not particularly different than any teenager who is likely to resent their parents for a myriad of reasons, from being too staid to being too restrictive. This just links back to my original point that this study doesn't in any way conflict with Joe's. To the extent that the resentment comes from negative social pressures, again, it's society at fault for that, not the parents. In the final case, the argument is circular logic. Saying that children considering that they might by homosexual is harmful only makes sense if you believe that homosexuality itself is harmful, which is what you are trying to prove. The argument itself has no inherent worth, its no different from saying that \"The children of Yankees fans are confused as to whether they should be Yankees fans or Red Sox fans, more often than not, they choose to be Yankees fans.\"",

The American Medical Association adopted the following position statement at its June 2004 meeting:\n \n \"Whereas, Having two fully sanctioned and legally defined parents promotes a safe and nurturing environment for children, including psychological and legal security; and\n \n \"Whereas, Children born or adopted into families headed by partners who are of the same sex usually have only one biologic or adoptive legal parent; and\n \n \"Whereas, The legislative protection afforded to children of parents in homosexual relationships varies from state to state, with some states enacting or considering legislation sanctioning co-parent or second parent adoption by partners of the same sex, several states declining to consider legislation, and at least one state altogether banning adoption by the second parent; and\n \n \"Whereas, Co-parent or second parent adoption guarantees that the second parent's custody rights and responsibilities are protected if the first parent dies or becomes incapacitated; and\n \n \"Whereas, Co-parent or second parent adoption ensures the child's eligibility for health benefits from both parents and establishes the requirement for child support from both parents in the event of the parents' separation; and\n \n \"Whereas, Co-parent or second parent adoption establishes legal grounds to provide consent for medical care and to make health care decisions on behalf of the child and guarantees visitation rights if the child becomes hospitalized; and\n \n \"Whereas, The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association have each issued statements supporting initiatives which allow same-sex couples to adopt and co-parent children; therefore be it\n \n \"RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support legislative and other efforts to allow the adoption of a child by the same-sex partner, or opposite sex non-married partner, who functions as a second parent or co-parent to that child.

They are less likely to have a healthy respect for both women and men as they grow into adulthood.\n\n \n What a load of ****.

   "I will reply to this assertion Jitobear: \n Gay activists are not asking for just one homosexual marriage, even though they often personalize it by saying, \"Don't you interfere with my family and I won't interfere with yours.\" What the activists want is a new national policy saying that no longer is a mom and a dad any better than two moms or two dads. That policy would turn some very important principles upside down:\n\n \n What gets me about your views is that you seem to turn a blind eye to what is actually ailing marriage in the first place. DIVOCE, INFIDELITY and LACK OF COMMUNICATION! \n (sorry about the caps, just trying to get my point across.)\n \n You see, marriage on the whole is a broken \"institution\" anyway. Personally I would think that encouraging MORE marriage and commitments would do a lot to fix it. \n \n \n \nMarriage would become merely an emotional relationship that is flexible enough to include any grouping of loving adults. If it is fair for two men or two women to marry, why not three, or five, or 17? The terms \"husband\" and \"wife\" would become merely words with no meaning.\n\n \n What you have again failed to recognize is the fact that indeed those are transient terms already. \n The type of \"marriage\" you are stuck on is \"Christian\" marriage, specifically. \n There are already other religious forms of \"marriage\" which do accept and encourage multiple partners, well more so multiple wives. That makes those marriages no less marriages than does your monogomous ideal between one of each gender. \n \n \nParenthood would consist of any number of emotionally attached people who care for kids. \"Mother\" and \"father\" would become only words.\n\n \n So are you then lessening the importance of step-parents or adoptive parents? Are they not called \"Mother\", \"Father\" ...etc? \n \n \n \nGender would become nothing. The same-sex proposition cannot tolerate the idea that any real, deep and necessary differences exist between the sexes. It must rest on a \"Mister Potato Head theory\" of gender difference (same core, just interchangeable body parts). If real differences did exist, then men would need women and women would need men. Our children would learn that sexual differences are like mere personality types. Wait until your kids start bringing those papers home from school.\n\n \n Ok, now you're the one who's truly confused here. You're confusing gender reassignment surgury for Transgenders with Gays and Lesbians.\n \n Sure there are some Transgenders who are gay or lesbian, but its a small percentage. \n \n What would you say to a child who is raised by his/her mother and grandmother? Are his/her parental influences any less important than that of a child raised in a two gender, married coupled home? \n What of a child raised by his/her mother and a step-father and who is shuffled off to his/her father's home where a step-mother is present? Are the parental influences of this child now lessened? \n \n What of that of a child raised by a single parent, mother or father but who has aunts and uncles and grandparents? Does this child somehow lack the gender influences?\n \n What you don't see and seemingly refuse to admit is that children are raised by the community of adults who ALL emotionally care for that child.\n Lawd knows I was raised by a mother and a father who remained married to one another throughout my childhood, and are still to this day, but come on, my dad was physically gone a lot of the time because he commuted to work everyday and my mother began working outside the home when I was in middle school. \n But I never lacked their emotional presences. I also had a very close relationship with my great grandparents, my Aunts and Uncles and Cousins galore! \n I learned invaluable lessons from each one of them, independently and on the whole. \n My son is being raised by myself (custodially), as well as my partner, his father and his step-mother, his grand parents, Aunts and Uncles on ALL sides! He has TONS of counsins, of which he is close to many of them...and every one of them plays a unique but important role in his life. \n \n I know that my son is not alone in the way he is being raised, and he lacks emotionally for nothing. \n He has friends who are being raised in a multitude of situations, relationships and whatnot. Some are Two parent, two gender families, some are divorced parents with blended families, some are gay/lesbian parented families. None of which are any less important to their children than the other.",
