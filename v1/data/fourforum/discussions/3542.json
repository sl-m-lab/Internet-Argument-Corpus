   "If George W. Bush is religious (bringing God in many of his speaches and his beliefs) then why doesn't he follow the ten most importaint rules in the Bible/Torah/(some parts)Koron?\n \n In the Torah/Bible/Koron (only on rule 9) Rules 9 and 10 are as followed:\n \n 9. (Torah) \"You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor\" \n \n (Prodestant) vs 16\n \"Requires the maintaining and promoting of truth between people, and of our neighbor's good name and our own, especially in witness-bearing.\n Forbids whatsoever is prejudicial to truth, or injurious to our own, or our neighbor's, good name.\" \n \n (Orthodox/Catholic) (this is actually the 8th commandment, in their religion, but im putting it in anyways) \"Neither shall you bear false witness against your neighbor.\"\n \n (Koron) (this is not exacitally part of a system of commandments, but an importain part) \"And if you give your word, do it justice, even if a near relative is concerned; and fulfill your obligations before God. Thus does God command you, that you may remember.\"\n _________________________________________________________________\n \n 10. (Jewish) \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house...\" (in Exodus, the text reads \"... neighbour's house, ... neighbour's wife, nor his manservant...\" etc. while in Deuteronomy, \"thy neighbour's wife, ... thy neighbour's house, his field\" etc.) \n \n (Prodestant) vs 17\n \"Enjoins contentment with our own condition, and a charitable attitude toward our neighbor and all that is his, being thankful for his sake that he has whatever is beneficial to him, as we are for those things that benefit us.\n Forbids discontent or envy, prohibits any grief over the betterment of our neighbor's estate, and all inordinate desires to obtain for ourselves, or scheming to wrest for our benefit, anything that is his. \"\n \n (Orthodox/Catholic) \"and you shall not desire your neighbor's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his XXX, or anything that is your neighbor's.\" \n \n \n \n I'll first talk about Commandment Number 9:\n \n Bush made a few promises: The War's Over\n \"God told me to strike at al Qaida and I struck them, and then he instructed me to strike at Saddam, which I did, and now I am determined to solve the problem in the Middle East.\" \n Before I even go any further...I don't know about you, but what the heck is Bush saying right there. God (which Bush said was a male) told him to wreck havoc in the middle east and send hundreds of people to their deaths? That is so unlike God. Also he lied right there. That broke the 9th commandment. Bush broke the 9th commandment, which God made, about the message of God. Confusing huh. Also when Bush said \"The Wars Over\" 1. There never was a war..congress didn't declare it, God sure as hell didn't declare it, and the UN didn't approve of it. (thats lie number 2) Lie number 3: the \"Over\" part. Its not over, its not going to be over for a loooong time. (Lie number 3)\n \n Now on to Commandment number 10: basically means not to hold a grudge and even trying to get a neighbors belongings.\n \n Well Bush didn't follow that either. Bush went into a Neighbor's \"home\" and took control of it. :xbanghead \"I *bang* do *bang* not *bang* understand *bang* it!!*bang*\"\n \n Also I'll just replace a few word on the 10th commandment to clerify what Bush shouldn't of done\n \n \"and you shall not desire your neighbor's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his XXX, or anything that is your neighbor's.\" \n \n revised one specifically for Bush\n \n \"and Bush shall not desire Iraq's country, its land, or its government, its oil, or its position in the world, or anything that is Iraq's property.\"\n Enough said about that.\n I dont understand why Bush uses religion and for something this big in the world, not follow its biggest commandments? Im cluless..help me out here!\n \n (where the Bush quote came from) \n http://www.bushwatch.com/evangelist.htm\n (where the commandments came from)\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_commandments",

   "famous amos, you see bush looking like he repented? are the words \"stay the course\" repenting words? has bush stopped falsely accusing saddam of stockpiling weapons and being a threat? has bush stopped coveting his neighbor's oil?\n \n even if bush didnt claim to be a christian, you dont need 10 commandments to see that something is wrong with this picture...\n\n \n \n Seriously, have you ever heard of common sense? The word covet is analagous to stealing. We certainly are not stealing oil from anyone. This is where your lack of common sense comes in...if we were stealing oil why would we be paying $56 a barrel for it, when we were paying in the high $30s, low $40s when Saddam was in power?\n \n Saddam was a threat. And accusing Bush of falsely accusing Saddam implies that Blair, Egypt, the CIA, and yes John Kerry did the same. This is straight from Kerry's mouth...\n \n \n -\"For the eight years we had inspectors there, what have we found? We found that the Iraqis were further along in the development of nuclear weapons and that they had more chemical and biological than we had ever seen before, number one. Number two, they've been uninspected for four years, and we did know that they had precursor chemicals and other efforts going on, according to our intelligence. We also had evidence through the intelligence community that they were engaged in activities with other terrorist organizations and so forth. I mean, I think it does raise questions about the intelligence we've got. I will tell you this, our intelligence has clearly improved since then.\"\n \n -After saying \"leaving Saddam unfettered with nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction is unacceptable\", Kerry continued to assert that \"Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction are a threat, and that's why I voted to hold him accountable and to make certain that we disarm him. I think we need to.\" \n \n \n These are John Kerry's own words.",

   "covet means wanting to steal. you can covet without stealing. you should know this\n \n i dont support kerry. he supports the war and plans to do more or less what bush would do if he gets elected. in fact, kerry would be better off with bush as his advisor. bush, kerry and blair were all misleading (not wrong) about the threat in iraq. the cia wasnt uninformed, they just had to report what the administration wanted to hear. the cia advised against going to war, but that didnt deter bush\n \n you think i care about republican or democratic agendas? i dont. politicians always lie. i care about the truth behind the war, and why we americans are in ostrich-like denial of the fact that bush wrongly accused saddam of possessing wmds and links to al qaeda. why is it that americans support our trillion-dollar spending glut into \"liberating\" iraq, while in egypt, saudi arabia, jordan, lebanon, yemen, iran, sudan, jordan, and a dozen other countries terrorism is rampant and unfettered. you americans stand behind a man who is deliberately misleading you, to the point of getting you killed and getting you to kill innocent people\n \n thou shalt not bear false witness\n \n thou shalt not covet thy neighboors goods",
