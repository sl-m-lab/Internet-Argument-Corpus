Largest YtY drop on record, and it \"further documents a lukewarm market\"?? \n \n \nThe median price of a single-family home fell to $219,800 last month, a drop of 2.5 percent from the price in September 2005. That was the biggest year-over-year price decline in records going back nearly four decades.\n\n \n For those who are shopping right now, that is a 2.4% MtM decrease, on top of a 2.7% MtM decrease last month. Lukewarm indeed.\n \n David Lereah, the NAR shill, had this to say:\n \n \n\"The worst is behind us as far as a market correction - this is likely the trough for sales,\" said David Lereah, the Realtors' chief economist. \"When consumers recognize that home sales are stabilizing, we'll see the buyers who've been on the sidelines get back into the market.\"\n\n \n It would be nice if he would actually put in some information as to what indicates to him that the worst is behind us. The last MtM decrease was the largest since the depression. This months decrease is the second largest since the depression. Where is the up side here??\n \n \nThe 2.5 percent drop in the price of single-family homes pushed them down to $219,800 while condominium prices fell by 3.2 percent to a median price which was also $219,800.\n",

Gas is, indeed, included in consumer spending numbers. Whats more, with gas prices as high as they were, we saw a fairly large increase in the use fo credit both for buying gas and overall. Apparently people could not afford to buy their gas, so they charged it. The decrease in gas prices should do some damage to consumer spending.

Consider these facts:\n \n INTEREST RATES ARE NEAR RECORD LOWS\n \n LARGE INVENTORY WON'T LAST\n \n PRICES OVERALL HAVE STABILIZED\n \n POSITIVE OUTLOOK\n \n REAL ESTATE IS A GREAT INVESTMENT\n \n \n Each of the above headings is followed by a few facts supposedly supporting the statement. For instance, consider these gems:\n \n Contracts for home sales in August are up 4.3 percent and the outlook is for home prices to increase next year. \n \n Alan Greenspan recently said \"Most of the negatives in housing are probably behind us. The fourth quarter should be reasonably good, certainly better than the third quarter.\"\n \n The national median price of homes bought ten years ago has increased 88 percent.\n \n That last statement is a flat out misrepresentation intended to mislead the public into believing there is no housing bubble. According to OFHEO's housing price index, the median price increased about 90% from 1980 to 1996. From 1996 to 2006 the median house price increased 95%, but from 2001 to 2006 the median price increased 70%, whereas the median price increased just 25% from 1996 to 2001.\n \n The average annual appreciation over the life of the index was 6.6% through 2001, and the annual average from 2001 to 2006 has been 19.0%.\n \n NAR is obviously very concerned about the market, or they wouldn't be telling stories.\n \n And don't even get me started about Greenspan's blunders in all of this mess.\n \n Jeff",

   "There are infinite ways to slice historical data. This can shed some light on our current situation. All the following data is based on the median house price in the first quarter of each year, based on OFHEO's HPI.\n \n Year over year average median house price appreciation (all U.S. homes):\n 1980 - 1990: 4.88%\n 1990 - 2000: 3.31%\n 2000 - 2006: 8.96%\n \n Recent growth has been two to three times greater than historical averages. That is shocking. Have you looked at a graph of median house prices? It is scary.\n \n California's real estate market bubbled in the late 1980's and early 1990's. That experience is worth revisiting.\n \n The average YoY growth in California's median house price was 4.83% from 1980 to 1986. The bubble began in 1987 when the annual YoY growth was 9.4%. The average YoY growth from 1986 through 1990 was 14.52%. Growth then fell to a YoY average of -1.6% from 1990 through 1997. The median price fell 13.4% from the high (3Q 1990) to the low (1Q 1995). It took over 8 years for the median house price to get back to the high of 3Q 1990.\n \n The average YoY growth in California's median house price was 8.12% from 1996 to 2002. The bubble began in 2003 when the annual YoY growth was 12.84%. The average YoY growth from 2002 through 2006 was 19.47%.\n \n The first bubble lasted about four years (1986 to 1990), during which the median price grew about 72%. This latest bubble has lasted 4 years (2002 to 2006), during which the median price grew about 97%.\n \n Granted, employment problems were the primary cause of the first California bust, whereas non-employment factors have caused this nationwide bubble and impending bust. But I'd argue this bubble and bust are far more serious for many reasons:\n \n * Economic malaise slowly caused the first California bubble to bust. Unwinding of speculation and bad monetary policy are rapidly causing this nationwide bubble to bust.\n \n * The recent bubble has generated far faster growth, and the total growth is significantly larger.\n \n * The first California bubble was not significantly fueled by speculators. Most home owners actually lived in their homes, owned only one home, had good jobs, and could afford to amortize their home loans. The current bubble has been largely driven by speculators, many of whom own two or more homes, don't have good jobs, and could never possibly amortize their home loans. California home owners did everything they could to keep their homes in the early 1990's. Many of today's home owners will give up and walk away soon because attempting to keep these homes would be economically stupid.\n \n * Walking away is going to flood the market with homes during the next 6 to 12 months. This is going to cause unprecedented downward pressure on home prices.\n \n * Finally, and most importantly, the California bubble was essentially a California problem. It didn't spread very far. Our current bubble is a nationwide problem. This is going to hurt everyone, including me, and it is going to be far more than a housing problem.\n \n By the way, I haven't introduce myself. I'm Jeff from Salt Lake City. I'm a bank examiner and CFA charterholder. I was a banker and broker before becoming a bank examiner. My wife is a manager with a regional home builder, so my predisposition to caution is reinforced daily when she tells me how 'things' are going at her company.\n \n Jeff",

Far too many peopel running around with no clue basing their financial arguments on blind faith. \n \n \n What do you expect form the NAR??? David Lereah, the chief economist at the NAR and a jackass by any definition, wrote a book that went to press in 2005 (feb) titled \"Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?: Why Home Values and Other Real Estate Investments Will Climb Through The End of The Decade-And How to Profit From Them\" In feb of 2006, he renamed the book to \"Why the Real Estate Boom Will Not Bust-And How You Can Profit from It\".\n \n Check out his wikipedia page (thats right, his irresponsible cheerleading actually got him his own wikipedia page) at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lereah\n \n Anybody stupid enough to believe the NAR is anything resembeling a reliable source deserves to get screwed out of their money.\n \n I do disagree with you as far as when the housing bubble began. I think it actually started in 1997, with all the instant millionaires from the .com bubble (soon to be instant bankruptcies) running out to buy McMansions with their new found wealth. Really up until then, you saw relatively normal, static sales, 1997-1998 you started to see abnormal sales increases.",

They are ahead of the curve.\n \n But the current bubble, based on OFHEO's index, began sometime after the terrorist attacks, and became a nationwide problem 2004: (YoY median house price growth):\n\n \n I guess my thought is basically this. I think that we shoudl have seen a severe recession following the dot com burst, including stagnation, if not deflation, in home prices. A trillion dollar bubble burst is a major economic even in an economy the size of ours, especially the size it was at the time.\n \n Instead of seeing that major recession, including the hit to home values, we saw a relatively minor recession and home values started ot increase. This was because Greenspan convinced the fed that they had to crash interest rates in order to save the economy.\n \n Interestingly enough, that same year he told congress that they needed to take steps to encourage home ownership.\n \n Greenspan knew damn well what he was doing. He looked around following the dot com burst for a market that could absorb a trillion dollars. The only one big enough was real estate, so he went with that. He knew full well he was building a housing bubble. Instead of the major correction that we were due, we got a little bump and a few years of recession. \n \n I will admit that my claim about when the housing bubble actually started is largely based on specualtion of what would have happened if the US economy had been allowed to take the hit it had coming as opposed to prolonging (and ultimatly intensifying) the inevitable. At the same time, the numbers do add up. Go back and take a look at the \"end\" of the dot com crash and the economic data for those years. Factor in a trillion dollar real loss to the economy. Use the most conservative numbers you can come up with, and even with the most conservative numbers imaginable, you are still looking at a severe recession, if not a mild depression. \n \n \n \nMany states throughout the rust belt and midwest have essentially been immune to this bubble, however the overall median price has soared. This underscores the risk in those markets that overheated:\n\n \n Immune to the building of the bubble. I doubt there is any such thing as immunity to the bursting. I woudl imagine that those \"immune\" states will be dragged down just like everywhere else. I know that in my state (KS), we largely avoided the bubble alltogether. Despite that, the RE market here has dwindled down to nothing and prices are falling. Part of that seems to be due to overall economic conditions, but there is also a pervasive bearish sentiment when it comes to the RE market, and much of that is based on the demise of the real estate bubble. I liken it to the dot com crash (again). Not just tech stocks went down the toilet, there were broad losses across the board.\n \n \nFinally, NAR frequently runs ads on TV, radio, and in newspapers touting the extensive training provided to REALTORS, including in-depth training on ethics.

   "The problem with this is that a bursting housing bubble will be economically devestating to everybody, regardless of their housing situation. \n well \"devestating\" to us means that we can no longer afford the 5 cars for a 3 person family and you can't travel to Hawaii twice a year....boo hoo.\n \n \nHousing has carried the economy for the last several years (including this year). A drastic decrease in the housing market will almost certainly see us in recession. Factor in the loss of easy capital from refinancing of overvalued mcmansions, and the consumer spending that comes with it, and one has to wonder....recession or depression? \n Meh, its the financing that the problem...ie debt...not really the fact that no one is buying the POS house.\n \n \n\n I am not kidding here. Figure housing (construction and associated activities) with its flowthrough multiplier between 4 and 6, depending on whose numbers you like. Figure refinances and that consumer spending with a reasonable flow through multiplier, and you are looking at serious, serious problems.\n It happens, I'm ok with it.",

   "In all honestly, a humbling may not be a bad thing for this country. I doubt we will hit great depression levels but the people from the great depreciation certainly learned what to value in life.\n\n \n I woudl agree that a little humble pie may be a good thing for our economy as a whole. I have said before that neither a high economy nor a low one are as good as one that accuratly reflects underlying fundamentals. \n \n The problem I see with the coming dose of \"humbling\" is that it is likely to be self perpetuating, with no real bottom in sight. Housing prices fall, which discourages purchasers (after all, why buy today when you can buy cheaper tomorrow), which lowers prices even more. Our equity markets (stocks) which are certain to take a SERIOUS hit as well suffer from the same thing. All the while, the dollar tanks, further devaluing everything in sight. \n \n IMO, the deciding factor is going to be public reaction to a sharp decline in the standard of living. Crime during the depression era was rampant, and there were not folks wandering around back then hopped up on crystal meth and willing to kill for a pair of sneakers.",

   "I think the most telling information comes from Federal Census Bureau information on total New Home completions vs. New Home Sales. The annualized rate of completions is roughly 1.9 million, the annualized sales are less than 1.1 million. I've made a copy of this, as well as having links to this information. Unfortunately I don't have enough posts at this time to include the links or the graphic here. \n \n However, I'll come back and post them here when I do have enough posts.

   "That inventory would seem in line with the past six-months drop in annualized new home sales published monthly. We all know developers kept building due to investment money being in the pipeline even when sales started falling off. With transactions from existing sales also dead in the water, 2nd quarter economic numbers are going to be very interesting. I don't have a model, but wish I did just to see how close the GDP drop is to forecasts. The last two quarterly numbers have failed, even when vigorously massaged by the government and readjusted in following months, to perform anywhere near forecasts. \n \n NRA statements will probably require a gallon or so of high-proof beverage for belief.",
