Are you with me so far? \"Adam And Eve's\" were instructed to go forth and multiply the earth. Who do you think Adam and Eve's sons multiplied with? Wouldn't it have to be their sisters? Or do you feel your ancestors multiplied with the dinosaurs? \n \n How about the story of Noah's ark? Noah's grandchildren had no one but the own cousins to breed with. \n \n The way I see it, you might want to be thanking your Creator that incest and poligamy existed in the old \"traditional\" days or your butt may not be here to breed your hate in the name of God.\n \n As far as gay marriage leading to poligamy being legalized...that is the \"traditional way\" back in the old testiment. Many men had more than one wife. \n \n So if you want to use your bible as a weapon against gay marriage, and if you fear this all leading to incestial marriage or poligamy, what is going to be your weapon against stopping that? You won't be able to use your bible as your weapon because incest and poligamy stories far out number your arguments against them.\n \n I would say you better get to finding a new weapon if this is your fear. \n \n Tell me, how does it feel to fear the future so much? Your insides must be tormented and in a dis-ease on a constant basis beings you are not able to force your beliefs and \"morals\" on everyone. Did you know that dis-ease causes disease? \n \n Just to clarify my position a little better...who people fall in love with and marry, is not my business. (or yours, contrary to what you might think.)\n Love is never wrong...God is love. Only people's false concept of what love really is, is the problem we face in this world.\n \n Lilac Angel",

I actually haven't given this subject much thought before and am just interested in what's behind the thinking on this being wrong.\n \n Cousins are 25% related by genetics. Based on your statement, would I be right in assuming you would not consider sex with someone that was related by 24% genetics as incest?\n \n I am trying to get a handle on what you consider incest and why you consider incest a sin. Is it the act of having sex with someone that is too closely genetically related or is it the acceptance of the act. In other words if someone married an adopted sibling that they did not know was their sibling, would having sex with that person be incest before they found out or after they found out or both. And would they need to obtain a divorce or should they stay married and just never have sex with that person again or how would that work? I'm making the assumption that you believe divorce is a sin which may be a bad assumption.",

   "Only problem with incest is that after several generations the chance of getting a recessive genetic disorder in the offspring are quite high. So really the only problem is that it can produce disabled childrenif continued, one off incest isn't really at all damaging (unless one of the original parents of the incesting couple has one of these genetic disorders). As a homosexual coupel have absolutely no chance of producing a child with these disorders these rules wouldn't apply. Is it actually a crime to have an child through incest- or just marrying your cousin/brother/parent by the way?\n \n Raises another point though, if the increased risk of disabled children is the reason for the law why are people who suffer from an serious dominant genetic disorder or two carriers of a recessive disorder allowed kids as long as they are not related?",

It is not in human nature to be depressed, be an alcoholic, be a pedophiler, or be gay. Being Black or Jewish is completely natural.\n\n \n Saying that homosexuality is abnormal is a subjective argument. Saying that it is a mental disorder that can be cured is a fallicy. Look at the DSMIV, there is no listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder. And comparing it to depression, alcoholism, and pedophilia is a rediculous connection. \n \n Depression is a mental disorder, one that often has underlying physiological origins..ie...imbalances of neurotransmitters. This can hardly be helped by the individual, and often can be treated and controlled, but not cured. \n \n Alcoholism is a disease, one that has strong genetic links. The addiction associated with alcoholism is both psychological and physiological. Alcoholism has also been associated with imbalances of neurotransmitters. Again, alcoholics cannot be cured, they can only be treated. You will never find a cured alcoholic, only a recovering one. Ask anyone who is a member of AA if they are an alcoholic or a former alcoholic. \n \n Pedophilia is a criminal act, unlike the rest of the list. Saying that pedophilia is a mental disorder is technically correct. It is listed in the DSMIV under the category of Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders. It is important to note however that most pedophiles are often diagnosed with other disorders, such as personality disorders...etc. Again, you will find few that would agree that this can be cured, only controlled through medication or behavior modification therapy. \n \n Homosexuality is a lifestyle, not an abnormal disorder or mental disease that can be cured. Where is your objection to homosexuality based, in your views, observations, and knowledge of human psychology or in your religious views? Saying that homosexuality is not human nature could not be farther from the truth...what do you think human nature is? Do you think gay people are \"recruited and brainwashed\" into the homosexual lifestyle? All of the things you listed are human nature. Human nature does not only include that which is considered good and morally acceptable by society, or the church. Human nature is behavior observed in humans. Being black is not human nature...it is genetic. Having 2 black parents makes you black. And being Jewish is not human nature...it is a religious affiliation that is learned. If being Jewish was human nature, people would be born with Jewish tendencies and ideals. Would you say that you were born Orthodox or raised Orthodox? If you were born and raised in a completely neutral religious environment where religion is not taught and information is not available on religion, would you still be Orthodox? Would you know what Orthodox theology was all about? If you did, then you could say that it is human nature.",

To minimize potential ascertainment and response biases, the study sample involved a large (N = 4901) community-based cohort of Australian twins aged 18-52 who answered an anonymous questionnaire on sexual behavior and attitudes. The statistical power of the analysis was increased by the availability of multiple measures of sexual orientation (behaviors, attitudes and feelings), providing stronger evidence for the existence of additive genetic influences on this phenotype than in a previous analysis (Bailey et al., 2000). Estimates of the heritability of homosexuality in this sample ranged between 50 and 60% in females but were significantly lower (heritability of approximately 30%) in males. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

I have always been attracted to females and never to males. I don&#8217;t think there is any amount of will that would make me become attracted to a male. I guess we&#8217;re just different.

I've never heard of that happening before though\n\n \n Then you are very uninformed. About one of every two thousand children in America are born with some kind of indefinite sexual characteristics. There is a point in fetal development when the sex organs of the child are determined by a shot of testosterone. If a child gets that hormone, they develop an external sex organ or penis, if not then they develop an internal sex organ or a clitoris. This is regardless of whether they have the XY male chromosome or the XX female chromosome. Of course if every thing goes according to plan, the fetus with the XY chromosome will get the shot of testosterone. However is a child with XY chromosomes does not get the shot of testosterone, then they develop female sex organs even though they have the male XY chromosomes. And the amount of testosterone can vary greatly, causing mixed sexual organs or underdeveloped sex organs.\n \n \n thats the traditional way, Hank\n\n \n I don&#8217;t understand how that was responsive to my question. But let me ask it a different way. What gender do you think a child should have when they have both sex organs.\n \n \n when all else fails, the rule is XY = male, XX = female. you cant have any other combination, so there is no guesswork\n\n \n Again you are uninformed. A person can have XO, XXY, XX/XY and other combinations. So there is a lot of guesswork. \n \n So with that information which you can look up for yourself if you don&#8217;t believe me, I will ask the question again.\n \n If someone that has female sexual organs but XY chromosomes and doesn&#8217;t know that, has sex with a male, then they are homosexuals?\n \n And again I&#8217;ll say, by your previous definition, God would have created a &#8220;sexual pervert&#8221;.",

The argument against the ban on gay marriages is over breaches of the Constitution. This isn't about personal views. It is about legal rights that are not being extened to all of the citizens of the United States that are afforded by the Consitution. The Consitution does not force you, or me, to approve of anything - only to respect the rights of those who are protected under it. The real question, then, is what right does anyone have to deny Constituational rights based on a sense of personal morality and NOT the reverse as stated at the end of the original post.\n \n 3)If the Constitution protects those who engage in incest, and if those who do engage in incest are being denied any rights afforded them by the Constitution by unconstituational laws, then I would have to say that I support a shift for those rights to be extended.

   "nobody said that incest was the same as homosexuality. however, Im sure you would agree that people in incestuous relationships are being socially pressure similar to the gay community a few years ago. so think about it, an incestuous couple cannot legally get married or benefit from any of the rights that homosexuals are protesting for. yet, like gays, their position is that they are consenting adults that are not hurting anyone by their actions. the sanctioning of gay marriages will very likely open the doors for incest marriage. bestiality commiters will possibly make similar arguments, since their logic is about the same (i.e., not illegal, not hurting anyone else), and there will be no surprise if people could marry their pets in the future.\n \n while nobody equated homosexuality to incest, there are grounds of commonality between the 2, and thats what the discussion was about. I hope you see that\n\n \n emoticon_confused Did you forget the original post? emoticon_confused \n \n In todays world it IS possible, unfortunately...\n \n And if you are FOR gay marriage between two biologically unrelated gay men/women and would be FOR a ban on marriage between two biologically related gay men/women,such as brothers/sister, aunts/nieces, etc... who are you to say anything about someone who wants a ban on gay marriage, like the proposed Constitutional Amendment.\n \n BTW, if you have no problem with gay marriage between two biologically related gay people, then you are sick. \n \n As well, I hear all the time that what someone does in the privacy of their own homes is their business. Would you agree in the case of two biologically related gay men/women, such as two biologically related gay brothers/sisters who are at the age of consent?\n \n I hope not.\n \n Lets see how many who say that it is discriminatory to ban gay marriage as with the proposed Cons. Amend. will show themselves to be hypocrites by not being for gay marriage with two biologically related gay men/women such as brothers/sisters who are at age of consent....\n \n Lets see how many are sick enough to be FOR marriage between two biologically related gay men/women, such as brothers/sisters, who are at age of consent.\n \n I am consistent. \n \n I am ONLY for traditional marriage... between a man and a woman.\n \n No gay marriage of any type, thank you.\n __________________\n How can anyone absolutely know that their actions/lifestyle choice isn't harming/hurting another? \n \n :p How many people know of someone who is gay that would like the right to marry their partner or a future partner? ______ How many people know of someone who is gay or straight that would like the right to marry their father, mother, sister, brother? _______ Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight. emoticon_rolleyes Who thinks these two questions have any link? ____________  :p",

I said the possibility may arise. furthermore I never said disallow gay marriages in the first place. \n \n what reason is there for a mother and son or 2 sisters not to get married?\n \n and on touching \"gay rights\", nobody is denying gay rights. gays are not being allowed to marry because thats the law, not because anybody is prejudiced or victimizing gays. until the laws change, it will be illegal for gays to marry. gays are making a big issue out of it, when really, they are the ones currently at fault. you cannot disregard a law and then be mad at the legal system for not accomodating you. if the laws change so that gays can get married, then fine. but nobody is denying gays any rights. gays are aware of the laws concerning marriage, yet they want do things contrary to the established legal framework and then cry discrimination when the legal system doesnt accomodate them. thats not how things work. \n \n I have no problem with gays lobbying to change the laws. thats what your state government is for. but dont go accusing people of discrimination when the gays are deliberately going against the law, and feeling the consequences",
