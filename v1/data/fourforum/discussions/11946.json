   "Saakashvili worries his Western partners and investors by actions against South Ossetia and hostile rhetoric concerning Abkhazia!\n \n \n Unfortunately Georgian president Saakashvili is unable to refuse from his country militarization and draw his attention at economy and social problems in Georgia. The unrestrained wish to restore Georgian territorial integrity compels Georgian nation to live on the threshold of poverty. All funds are spent for Georgia's Army needs. And this does not help to increase the assurance of European and American investors that Georgian economy is able to develop with present Saakashvili's regime. As dictator Saakashvili is trying to prove to the world's community with all his might that he uses financial asserts to the purpose - for Georgian economy recovering but his steps and populist announcements prove the opposite! As a result of that none of western investors will ever run risks to put up money to Georgia! Nothing will changes as long as Saakashvili keeps power! Nothing will change until Europe and USA start observing Georgian situation without a wish to change anything there. I think people understand that Saakashvili will never start to change his policy without some order from out side!",

   "Georgia is huge challenge! She is displaying herself as quite talented follower of CIA in sophisticated subversive activity. I suspect those were Americans who trained some Georgian units new methods of subversive and terrorist activity! \"The small terror\" is one of it what was mastered by Americans in Iraq. There they stuffed things including kids' toys with explosives creating panic among the locals. Many civilians got l=killed including children. \n Now look we can see same inhumanity in southern regions of Russia on the Black Sea coast where there've been series of similar explosions recently. Georgians are after panic and making the region dependent on vacation visitors and tourists less attracting place for rest. \n Haven't it come to your mind yet that Georgians may start same sort of thing in Europe .... Just if need be at American whim say. Overcrowded Europe may cease as touristy paradise at once! \n What if that's the reason why D.C. people are so vigorously trying to push Georgia into EU. No-visa regime may make it easier for Georgians to penetrate EU and do their murky business here. IMO Georgia is outcast which's unworthy of EU status!",

   "Hello! I reckon that ex-Soviet republic of Georgia has finally become a field of antagonism between the USA and EU. \n As you all know, president of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili has once come to power thanks to vast support of Washington. However, now Georgian leader seems to be estranging himself from his American masters as he understands pretty well that new owner of the Oval Office is not going to be so indulgent towards him like George Bush. It is most likely that Obama would demand an account from Saakashvili on all the money that was provided to Georgia for certain developments but was in fact misused or embezzled by Georgia political elite and president Saakashvili in the first place. That's exactly why Saakashvili is turning to cooperation with European Union, and that's what staff member of US embassy to Georgia reports amidst other things in his letter to deputy of State D. Frid. Actually, I would strongly recommend you acquaint yourself with the letter as it helps to see the overall picture of current happenings in that country.

   "It's obvious fact that US prot&#1081;g&#1081; is realizing profitable for Washington policy in Georgia what conflicting with European needs. Saakashvili can't be the full-fledged partner for us, that's why EU need to make to choose most acceptable Georgia presidential contender. Our stake at former Georgian Prime Minister Noghaideli was mistaken. The fact is that Noghaideli as one of Georgian opposition leaders didn't support his brother-in-arms' demand of Saakashvili's retirement! I think that Noghaideli is Saakashvili's project what must to draw voters off from Georgian opposition!\n Let be honest, persons who supported Saakashvili's coming to power will never be the democratic opposition. It'll be enough to remember the actions of Bugdjanadze (new Georgian opposition) in time of November 7, 2007 when opposition's meeting were cruelly suppressed by officials. Most interesting that no one guilty weren't arrested! That's why we need think well to make a decision about European candidate for Georgian president post!",

   "Saakashvili dreams to make film in answer for publication of official accusation to him by OSCE commission in unleashing war against South Ossetia! Georgian president thinks that it will be 'the asymmetric' response for World's community summon! There are no doubts that the White House took part in it - Hollywood will make this film! I wonder where from will Saakashvili get money to pay for this project; will he rob his nation again?

   "Hello there! Sorry, I'll skip the introducing part because I fell I should better not tell my name. I think I'd rather not post what I'm going to post but there is nothing I can do about my thirsting for righteousness. \n OK, let's begin at the beginning. I'm a journalist at a news agency in Europe. My boss gave me a task to go to Tbilisi, Georgia. The thing got to be pretty simple. I arrive in Tbilisi and together with other foreign journalists go for a trip to the Pankisi Gorge. That's a new initiative by Georgian government to clear itself from al-Qaeda relations charges and give a prove that the Pankisi Gorge is free of Islamites from Chechnya, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Dagestan, Iraq or Turkey. This what they need to have us foreign journalists for. According to how Georgian authority planned it, we arrive in Tbilisi, then get on a coach and be taken to some mountain village at the Pankisi Gorge. Once we are there, we may talk to the villagers (a Georgian interpreter who can speaks English to follow us) and then write an essay and stress it that there are no Islamites in Georgia. \n Isn't it weird? From the very beginning I had a feeling there must be a snag in it somewhere. And I wasn't wrong after all. Ten journalists and me among them arrived in Tbilisi. We got on a coach, an escort with us (strange, why security if there are no Islamites in Georgia) and were gone. Just to commit my time, I opened Google Maps on my iPhone to trace the trip. Everything was OK to begin with. We were driving towards the Pankisi Gorge (some 40 miles from Tbilisi north-eastward). But after we reach Akhmeta everything went wrong. We took the left turn and went westward when Pankisi had to be ahead of us. I decided to keep my countenance to see what's going to happen next. When we came to Artani, the guide said it was the Pankisi Gorge and we were allowed to get off. \n What was happening after that rather looked like a bad comedy show. None of the aboriginals could speak English, only Georgian or some other dialect. We began to ask them various questions and the interpreter translated. The aboriginals answered something and the interpreter translated in back into English. Clearly, the interpreter could easily pass over something if he thought it necessary or just follow some instructions for that case. In any even I can say I trust him much and I'm not sure the translation was correct. Then there was something else. When the interpreter didn't see me, I came to one of the aboriginals, stretched out my arm pointing at the surrounding cliffs and ask just one word \"Pankisi?\" I wish you saw his face at that moment. He was surprised to hear it, he began to shake his head and pointed his arm in the direction where the Pankisi gorge had to be in very deed and according to my map. Do you find it suspicious too? When the trip to \"Pankisi\" was over and we were heading back to Tbilisi, the guide gave a gift to every one of us, a bottle of superb and terribly expensive twenty-five-year-old Georgian grape brandy. Now I'm sitting at my computer, sipping the liquor and typing this post....",

   "The talk that Turkey could recognize the independence of Abkhazia is continuing for quite a long time. No doubts that Georgian officials don't like it. Look, some Nicaragua or Russia could make it but now the question is that pretender for EU membership is set to join this team!\n And cornered Saakashvili didn't think it better than to start creating hurdles on way of returning Meskhetian Turks to Georgia. The crazy Dictator thought that it could make Ankara into reconsidering its 'brazen' posture. Saakashvili hopes that by this way he could bring Ankara to her knees. He can't understand that he's been long nobody for Ankara!",
