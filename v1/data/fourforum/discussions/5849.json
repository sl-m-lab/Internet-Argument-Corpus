   "\n Supreme Court Justice O'Connor retiring\n First female member of court; key swing vote on abortion, death penalty\n Updated: 10:30 a.m. ET July 1, 2005\n WASHINGTON - Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court and a key swing vote on issues such as abortion and the death penalty, said Friday she is retiring. \n\n \n Say \"Bye, Bye\" to Roe v Wade and \"Hello\" to the death penalty. :) \n THIS should get real interesting now. Can you say \"Nuclear option\"?",

GW2 isn't dumb enough to NOT take advantage of this opportunity, IMO. If he is and the Republicans cave, then it's time for a regime change. \n The \"Nukleer option\" will take care of any filibuster.

This may be the only opportunity to put the judicial activist SCOTUS Genie back in the bottle for another 10 years. \n The country is moving smartly to the Right. If you think that the Silent Majority will remain so during the next few months, you're sadly mistaken. Ted Kennedy is already on TV trying to both appeal to Bush and threaten him at the same time. Up until now, one of GW2's greatest assets is that he rarely listened to Democrats. When he did, as in the NCLB law, he got burned by the Left that originally supported the bill. GW2 isn't dumb enough to NOT take advantage of this opportunity, IMO. If he is and the Republicans cave, then it's time for a regime change. \n The \"Nukleer option\" will take care of any filibuster.

   "Really? emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Wow. You've missed the whole point Duo. The claim wasn't anything about Bush, the claim was about the Supreme Court justice. I used Bush as an example to simply display the different schools of thought. But if you want me to make a claim about Bush, I will do it.\n \n Bush said his favorite justices are Scalia and Thomas. He said he would appoint these type of justices to the Supreme Court should an opening occur. Scalia and Thomas both sided on the side of the Constitution in Kelo v New London. Thus, Bush would appoint somone who sided with the Constitution in Kelo v New London.\n \n Ted Kennedy, on the other hand, favors justices like Breyer, Ginsberg, and Stevens. These justices sided with \"BIG buisiness\" istead of the Constitution in Kelo v New London. Thus, Ted Kennedy would like to see someone appointed who wouldn't have sided with the Constitution in Kelo v New London.\n \n \nComming from someone who claims something, runs away, snipes and then flees like a coward?\n\n Right emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nObviously you again show that you are supremely ignorant.\n\n Supremely ignorant? You have shown again that you are full of nothing but insults, proving that you have nothing interesting or intelligent to add to the discussion.\n \n \nI'll make this as simple as I can for someone as dense as you. \n \n Bush - Owned Rangers\n Ranger Stadium - Built on land grab\n Land Grab - Hugely aganist consitution\n Bush wants someone who follows consitution? His history seems to differ.\n\n Aside from the fact that Bush is known for keeping his word (and thus will appoint an originalist), his history suggests that he will appoint an originalist. All you have to do is take a look at the justices he has already appointed to the lower appeals courts. Do you have more than a Bush bash to add to the discussion? Probably not.",

   "A recess appointment right now would have the judge serving for 18 months.\n At that time, the President can nominate him for a permanent position. The advantage of this would be the ability to use the 18 month \"track record\" to demonstrate that the judge was, indeed, qualified for the position. The risk is that the judge sucked or was perceived to have sucked.\n\n \n Yes, the prsident can appoint him for a permanent piosition once the next congress takes seat. Never in the nations history has such an appointment gone through. \n \n \nI'm not advocating using a recess appointment. I simply stated that it was an option. I'd rather see Congress forced into an up/down vote on all nominees. If that means exercising the nuclear option, so be it. \n\n \n Again, the nuclear option will almost certainly not happen. It would lead to a nast constitutional battle in the courts. Additionally, the republicans filibuster nominees just as often as the democrats. To give up that tol for future use to gain a temporary advantage would be idiotic.\n \n \nA judge is still a judge. Whether he was recess appointed or not is immaterial. \n\n \n Unless it is later ruled that to use a recess appointment ot appoint a judge becuase you could not get congressional approval is unconstitutional. If that is the case, you end up witha bunch of judges that have been illegally appointed. It stands to reason that an illegally appointed judge is not a judge at all.

A filibuster shut down the senate because the issue could not be put down. The minute people stopped talking, a vote would commence.\n \n Extended debate allows an item to be tabled, but brought up later. This means that all that is really needed for a filibuster is for the group wishing to filibuster to have a member in senate at all times when it is in session to request recognition if a motion for a vote is made. Theoretically, they could require refuse to table the issue temporarily and force the filibustering party to keep a speaker on the floor at all times.

   "First of all, the fact that udges are appointed for life. That is a pretty big one. Whatever party happens to be in power at the time does not have the ability to remove old jusges and install their own. \n \n Second, the fact that the senate (and at one time the house) have had the right to unlimited debate fromt heir inception. Thomas Jefferson wanted to add the right to the constitution. He argued that whiule it would give a single man the ability to shut down congress, that such a tactic would never withstand the storm of public scrutiny. If the majority of the public truly wanted a particular measure to pass, the filibuster would eventually end in defeat. It would give th epublic an opportunity to be heard, though, so fi they did nto wish for the measure to pass, it would givwe them time to address their own representatives.\n \n Our entire governement is set up as a system of checks and balances, with an armed public as the final balance.\n\n \n \n None of what you cited above were measures designed to eliminate a single party monopoly. And since you've brought Jefferson into the debate, Jefferson was fearful of an activist Judiciary and argued that it should be held accountable to a majority voice \" If there were to be any part of a democratic society to be trusted with independence, it could be trusted nowhere but with the people in mass.\"\n Clearly, Jefferson believed that the majority should have control, not only of the Executive and Legislative Branches of the Federal Government, but the Judiciary Branch as well. Nowhere in Jefferson or Madison's writings have I found an expression of a desire to force a two-party system on the population and during the time of Jefferson and Madison, there were two diametrically opposed philosophies, republicans and anti-republicans.",

   "The filibuster was first used to block a judicial nominee in 1881, when it was invoked against Rutherford B. Hayes' nomination of Stanley Matthews to the U.S. Supreme Court. (Matthews was eventually confirmed.)\n\n \n You said...\n \nFilibustering judicial nominees is nothing new. The first time it was done was in 1802. \n\n \n \nI moved the second quote because it is related. Take a look at the list fo the first supreme court justices. tehy were all strong federalists. Now, before you make yourslef look REALLY stupid, go to www.google.com and type in \"midnight judges\".\n \n For those who are nto completely ignorant of the facts and just need a little refresher, the midnight judges were appointed by Adams (second president) in 1800 after the presidency and congress were both taken over by the democratic republicans (anti federalists.....Adams was a federalist). Literally the day before his hitch was up, and with the support of a lame duck, federalist controlled congress, they created new federal judiciaries and apopointed federalist judges to them as an attempt to balance the power of the incoming democratic republicans.\n\n What do the midnight judges have to do with the 1st people on the supreme court being appointed by their personal beliefs? \n \n moreover, what does all of this have to do with the living constitution. Just take a look at the federalist papers and you can figure out that the consitution is not supposed to be \"living\" and change with the \"evolving standards of decency\". With a living constitution no case is ever wrong, the constitution just happened to change...presumably by little mice with pens.",
