Pure and simple, and has no place being written into MY constitution.\n\n \n A life's story doesn't necessarily make one change their mind. My the way, I happen to agree that all gay people should have individual rights. Although the CONstitution is set-up to promote state decisions in this matter (ie marriage)--if that is your concern. Whether the moral majority of politicians and people believe in such and such, that's another issue. As far as I'm concerned, you can do whatever you want, just as long as you don't force me to be a part of it. I'm sure that's fine with you.

Agreed.\n \n \nBTW; if people were so \"indifferent\" why bother being so negative?\n\n \n I'm not people, I'm me. You can ask me a direct question, because as far as I know, I don't represent them in being 'negative'. So why me? This message board is floated with a sparse amount of issues, as well as the world. The critical issues won't come down to whether someone can't or can get married, but whether our system and culture is aligned to see past their realities. This doesn't mean that everyone has to be concerned with little billy in Africa; but why not ask yourself why Billy is doing so bad? People often feed the soup to the kid, and he ends up getting shot the next year; so their feeble plan is useless in the long-run. \n \n So when I hear your plight, I often think about the soup you desire, and the bullet that will head your way (when your not paying attention). Is this the battle you chose to fight,...over issues that will be nonetheless minor in the face of so many other 'truely' important ones? My indifference comes from the fact that I know you, like Billy, are a person/people I can't help if the culture is misaligned. I hear every day of a person getting shot or killed because of the lack/intrusion of individual rights. And when some tells me the cure to all of this is 'soup', then I feel indifferent to need, because it's a lost cause.\n \n I feel indifferent because in the scheme of it, I would give that 'right' up, if I could regain others...and I'm not gay. \n \n \n Is there some other 'right' (other than marriage), that gay people want?",

And, the jury is still out on whether your story has a happy ending. You were happy with your husband and children for a time also. \n \n My 2 cents,\n \n Terral\n\n \n Ah yes, yet another person who has completely missed the point.\n \n What you missed was that I was speaking from MY own experience.\n Personal experience is priceless and immutable.\n You also missed that indeed I have been BLESSED in my life since comming to terms with the fact that not only am I gay, but I have a responcibility to live honestly as to set an example of honesty to my child.\n \n Also, I really hate to inform you, but my divorce had absolutely NOTHING to do with my being gay. My ex was incapable of being loyal. He did so in his marriage previous to mine as well as again with his marraige after mine. My marriage ended because of HIS infidelity and lack of loyalty. Not mine.\n \n If you bothered to read what I wrote, you would have noticed that I pointed out very clearly that my life was HELL while I continued to live a lie. My heart was plagued with regret and confussion. My mind was filled with selfhatred placed there due to social ingorance and hate. \n Only once I stoped living that lie was I free of selfhatred. Only once I accepted who I am and that God made me perfectly this way, was I able to accept his blessings into my life. \n Only once I rejected the social hate and accepted God's love of my own truth was I truly happy. Not only was I happy, but my family was happy. My son was happy. I was able to find a partner of whom I know is just as commited to our life together as the well being of my child. \n Only once I acccepted who I am and lived in accourdence to it, my family of origin was happy for me. They support me, welcome me, love me, my partner and my son. \n They know that I am now the ABSOLUTE best role model for my son and that he is being raised by someone who will not teach him to lie or to hate. \n \n Your accusations are not only unfounded but based in fear. I pity you.\n I hope that one day you will see the error of your ways and be able to accept all people regardless and in some cases because of the differences we all posess.\n My lifestyle is that of a mother, first and foremost. \n Next I am a partner in a relationship which is dedicated to the well being of the child we raise together.\n Only after that my lifestyle is then of someone who works for a living, drives my son to football practice and encourages his studies.\n I am his role model, his teacher, his support system, his MOTHER.\n \n I did NOT begin this thread for any kind of sympathy whatsoever. Actually it was meant as a testimony of empowerment and acceptance. \n \n I don't ask; \"Why me\" anymore, accept in an act of gratefulness to be able to be my son's mother and for all the other Blessings I have recieved. \n \n I was unsure of my life's path when I was younger, but even though it was filled with confussion and selfloathing before, I wouldn't change even the smallest of experiences. From every little bit of my life has taught me something along the way. \n Those lessons are priceless and immeasurable. The mere fact that I am now able to share my life is a miracle of itself. \n How dare you condemn anyone, let alone me, for having lived through dark times to come out better for it? \n \n I put my post up so that I could share with others. So that maybe, just maybe I could reach the heart of others. \n I see that you just might not have one, from your post.\n For that I feel very sorry for you, not to mention anyone that may come into contact with you.",

   "Ah yes, yet another person who has completely missed the point.\n \n What you missed was that I was speaking from MY own experience.\n Personal experience is priceless and immutable.\n You also missed that indeed I have been BLESSED in my life since comming to terms with the fact that not only am I gay, but I have a responcibility to live honestly as to set an example of honesty to my child.\n \n Also, I really hate to inform you, but my divorce had absolutely NOTHING to do with my being gay. My ex was incapable of being loyal. He did so in his marriage previous to mine as well as again with his marraige after mine. My marriage ended because of HIS infidelity and lack of loyalty. Not mine.\n \n If you bothered to read what I wrote, you would have noticed that I pointed out very clearly that my life was HELL while I continued to live a lie. My heart was plagued with regret and confussion. My mind was filled with selfhatred placed there due to social ingorance and hate. \n Only once I stoped living that lie was I free of selfhatred. Only once I accepted who I am and that God made me perfectly this way, was I able to accept his blessings into my life. \n Only once I rejected the social hate and accepted God's love of my own truth was I truly happy. Not only was I happy, but my family was happy. My son was happy. I was able to find a partner of whom I know is just as commited to our life together as the well being of my child. \n Only once I acccepted who I am and lived in accourdence to it, my family of origin was happy for me. They support me, welcome me, love me, my partner and my son. \n They know that I am now the ABSOLUTE best role model for my son and that he is being raised by someone who will not teach him to lie or to hate. \n \n Your accusations are not only unfounded but based in fear. I pity you.\n I hope that one day you will see the error of your ways and be able to accept all people regardless and in some cases because of the differences we all posess.\n My lifestyle is that of a mother, first and foremost. \n Next I am a partner in a relationship which is dedicated to the well being of the child we raise together.\n Only after that my lifestyle is then of someone who works for a living, drives my son to football practice and encourages his studies.\n I am his role model, his teacher, his support system, his MOTHER.\n \n I did NOT begin this thread for any kind of sympathy whatsoever. Actually it was meant as a testimony of empowerment and acceptance. \n \n I don't ask; \"Why me\" anymore, accept in an act of gratefulness to be able to be my son's mother and for all the other Blessings I have recieved. \n \n I was unsure of my life's path when I was younger, but even though it was filled with confussion and selfloathing before, I wouldn't change even the smallest of experiences. From every little bit of my life has taught me something along the way. \n Those lessons are priceless and immeasurable. The mere fact that I am now able to share my life is a miracle of itself. \n How dare you condemn anyone, let alone me, for having lived through dark times to come out better for it? \n \n I put my post up so that I could share with others. So that maybe, just maybe I could reach the heart of others. \n I see that you just might not have one, from your post.\n For that I feel very sorry for you, not to mention anyone that may come into contact with you.\n\n \n As I said the first time, you have more integrity, spirit, drive, and humility than the average bear. You are very brave. A lot of people cannot see beyond was is told to them. They don't examine things and try things out. They don't question things as was intended.",

In fact I have been a better person because of it as well as my acceptance of it. \n No, I don't believe anyone can be forced to become homosexual nor heterosexual. We simply are who we are. \n Those who are so dead set against it, I feel pity for.

And closet homosexuals have become exceedingly bold, seeking to impose (through their heathen interest groups), their excrement upon the entire society. \n \n Indeed, it is true: a heathen society's standards change, and that's why america is now so thoroughly corrupt. But heathen america deliberately overlooks another fact: God never changes. He is the same yesterday, today and forever (Hebrews 13:8). \n \n Homosexuals in every generation should ever remain aware that they will always be under the hot wrath of the Almighty God and every sane and godly human mind as long as they are homosexuals. Foolish constitutional tolerance of homosexuality by an already heathen and atheistic america should not be mistaken to be a true acceptance by the Holy God. By deceptively posing as \"christians\" \"ministers\" and trying to thrust themselves into a fake atmosphere of \"church\" does not change the true God and His truths that homosexuality is an abomination and a very heinous crime (Leviticus 18:22).",
