   "This month will be the anniversary of Albert Einstein's\n birthday. He was born March 14, 1879. Few remember that the Nobel Prize\n winner married his cousin, Elsa Lowenthal, after his first marriage\n dissolved in 1919.\n \n He stated that he was attracted to Elsa because she was well endowed.\n He postulated that if you are attracted to women with large breasts, the\n attraction is stronger if there is a DNA connection.\n \n It was called Einstein's Theory of Relative Titty.",

   "Did that use to be quite common in Europe for one to marry his cousin? I guess even Einstein had a tendency to be too traditional.\nWhy confine it to Europe? Have you read of the DuPonts? They had their own insane asylum. Their main purpose in intermarrying was to keep the money in the family.\n \n I've heard nothing of it being traditional, just occasional, sometimes widespread within a small region of the total scene. There are jokes about some states having a proclivity to relative titty.",

   "Why confine it to Europe?...\n\n I confined what I said to Europe because Einstein was from Europe. He was either from Germany or in a surrounding country. Now, if the entire reason for this thread was just to talk about Einstein's Theory of Relative Titty, then why didn't you label it as such or something other than about his birthday coming up? Did you not think you would get too many takers. I'm sure with a thread heading of relative titty (or anything with titty in it for that matter) would probably get some attention.\n <EDIT<\n I read Frankinstein about a month and a year ago. Victor was having a relationship with his cousin. I commented to someone in class that that would be something just right for Jerry Springer. Then I was told that it was more common in Europe so I figured there was some kind of connection there.\n \n Hey, don't forget an old movie from the 50's or so (it had Elvis in it so I assume it was the 50's or early 60's) called Kissing Cousins.",
