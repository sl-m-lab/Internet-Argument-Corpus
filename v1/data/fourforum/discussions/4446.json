   "Our current controversy regarding SS reform has displayed a long dormant factor in US politics, the public speaking its mind. The federal representatives in my state have made public comments stating that they've been overwhelmed with SS comments from constituents by telephone, letters and email. And those comments are from a broad spectrum of voters, not just retired folks concerned about their benefits. \n \n If America could shake its apathy on other important issues and TV network escapism broadcasting was eliminated, there might be a slim chance we could wrest control of our country from the sleaze politicians.",

Thus, I have a hard time worrying about Social Security colapsing in 14 years when I see the billions and trillions of tax dollars being squandered in every other facet of our government.",

   "I believe Congress has become ineffectual, both nationally and in many states. They've lost their way. It seems to be more systemic than simply a matter of being evenly divided between two parties, although the reason for that escapes me right now.\n \n As a result, initiatives and referendums are filling the ballots in progressive states that are tired of the never-ending bickering. More and more issues are being directly decided by the voters. I'm not a huge fan of this movement, simply because I believe stability suffers as a result. We are approaching mob rule.\n \n The Supreme Court has also moved into the vacuum. Once again, I would prefer Congress do the job. \n \n I guess my question is why has the legislative branch lost its backbone?",
