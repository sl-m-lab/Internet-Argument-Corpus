   "Jewish gunman was no terrorist, Israel rules\n \n Four Arab Israelis shot dead by a soldier opposed to the closure of the Gaza Strip settlements are not victims of \"terror\" because their killer was Jewish, Israel's defence ministry has ruled, and so their families are not entitled to the usual compensation for life.\n \n The ministry concluded that the law only recognises terrorism as committed by \"organisations hostile to Israel\" even though the prime minister, Ariel Sharon, described the killings by Private Eden Nathan Zaada, 19, as \"a despicable act by a bloodthirsty terrorist.\"\n \n He shot dead four people on a bus in the Arab Israeli town of Shfaram on August 4 and was then lynched by a mob.\n \n Read more:\n \n http://www.davidduke.com/?p=412\n \n \n Related Threads:\n \n Hate Crimes Committed by the Chosen People\n \n America's \"Ally\", Israel, Caught Spying Once Again\n \n \n \n .",

   "David Duke? There's a real winner for accurate news info....\n \n \n \n David Duke's cosmetic surgery-enhanced charisma not only won him votes in his runs for political office, but also hundreds of thousands of dollars from supporters. \n Charisma, though, may be the only thing Duke's backers got for their donations - the former Klansman allegedly blew their money at craps. \n \n In November, federal agents searched the long-time white supremacist's suburban New Orleans home for evidence that he had defrauded supporters and channeled political funds to his own personal use in a series of complex financial transactions. \n \n In the seven-hour search, investigators collected 22 boxes of evidence including casino chips, tax records, statements from Duke's many bank accounts, 30 credit cards and a stolen gun. \n \n One informant told the FBI that Duke and his staff were laughing while they devised phony pretexts for mass-mail solicitations netting hundreds of thousands of dollars, court documents show. Duke allegedly lost much of the money raised at several casinos, where pit bosses considered him a \"high roller.\" \n \n At press time, charges had not been filed in the continuing investigation, which Duke called groundless and politically motivated. \n \n Duke was in Russia at the time of the federal raid, promoting his new racist book The Ultimate Supremacism: An Examination of the Jewish Question in Russia and Elsewhere in Europe. \n \n In addition to developing his newest white supremacist group, the National Organization for European American Rights (see 'Blood on the Border' and Anti-Immigration Groups), Duke has been cultivating far right contacts in Europe in the last year or so. He says he is concentrating on Russia because Moscow is the \"whitest\" of all of the European capitals. \n \n \n Intelligence Report\n Spring 2001",

   "Suppose its the fact that he was 'making his statement against the government' against the wrong people (though they were Israeli) and wasn't part of an organisation that was hostile to Isreal. Technically speaking he wasn't actually a terrorist just a normal muderer objecting to policy. Its a fine line but it always is when it comes to governments giving away money.\n \n You'd think that at the moment they would compromise and make it a special case, if only for some good PR",
