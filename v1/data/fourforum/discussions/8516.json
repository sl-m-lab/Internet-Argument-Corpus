   "http://select.nytimes.com/2006/07/16/opinion/16warner.html\n \n July 16, 2006\n Guest Columnist\n Stressing Parenthood \n By JUDITH WARNER\n In the lead essay to this year's \"State of Our Unions\" report, which was released last week by the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University, Barbara Dafoe Whitehead looks at popular television shows, surveys, books and magazines and concludes that parents today are an unhappy lot. They're anxious, depressed, warring in stress-torn marriages and feeling \"out of sync\" with a larger, adult world of \"fun.\" \n \n Parents feel this way, she says, in part because they've been spoiled by too many years of childless living. Earlier generations began raising children just after their teens and had such large families that they were busy with their kids well into middle age. But today's adults have children later and have fewer of them, spending decades instead soused on cosmopolitans and scattering their disposable income on Caribbean vacations - all of which makes buckling down to the financial and personal constraints of life with children extremely difficult. The situation is the worst among - Guess who? - highly educated professional women, for whom life with little people who have no respect for time management and no ability to generate performance reviews is as much a shock, Whitehead writes, as was Victorian brides' first experience of sex.\n \n Though I've previously been tagged as one of the chief purveyors of mommy misery, I have to say that I cannot recognize myself - or anyone I know - in this picture.\n \n That isn't to say that other parents and I don't suffer from stress, anxiety or sometime marital tensions. Of course we do. But does that mean that parenthood is for us the \"source,\" as Whitehead puts it, of dissatisfaction and distress?\n \n Absolutely not. On the contrary: children are the bright spot - the joy - that makes every other aspect of life worthwhile. Furthermore, motherhood, rather than \"losing its luster\" as Whitehead attests, seems to me to be considered a more worthy and desirable vocation now than it was at any other time in recent memory. (Our 50's- and early-60's-era moms never talked about it with the reverential breathiness we routinely muster.) If anything, in this era when having children is a choice, and women's infertility struggles drive home the fact that the ability to become pregnant is a gift, I would say that parenthood is more highly prized than ever.\n \n To suggest otherwise, to assert that mothers and fathers who express something other than Hallmark card sentiments about life with children somehow have issues with parenthood, is profoundly unfair. But it isn't new. For at least five years now, ever since \"mommy lit\" emerged as a best-selling book genre, there have been stolid folk who have been using words like \"whiners\" and \"spoiled\" to get parents - and educated mothers in particular - to put up or shut up. And the way they most commonly do this is to recast big social problems as the little personal problems of those who \"complain\" about them.\n \n Yet \"the rising chorus of complaint\" that Whitehead and other critics decry is based upon rock-solid reality. The depression and anxiety and angst and guilt they see - and trivialize - aren't due to parents' cravings for bigger cars or better clothes; they're due to the fact that life for most parents is really hard. It's expensive and competitive and stressful and fatiguing, for reasons that have nothing to do with having a bad attitude toward the challenges - and pleasures - of child-rearing. \n \n Not having access to decent child care or affordable health care or good quality public education is not a question of attitude. Neither is being frustrated that you can't ever make it home for a family dinner because you can't afford to work a decent schedule or to live close enough to work to make it home at a decent hour. Talking about these problems isn't a condemnation of parenthood; it's a condemnation of the way parenthood is being lived, in our culture, at this particular time.\n \n The problems facing American families - the dilemmas currently sapping the joy out of motherhood for vast numbers of women in particular - are real social and economic phenomena. They can't be fixed just by changes in attitudes or \"priorities\" - at least, not just by changes in the attitudes and priorities of individual women or families. They require social change - a new attitude toward collective responsibility, a new infusion of meaning into debates about our nation's values. And they require listening to mothers' (and fathers') complaints - not shutting them up. \n \n Judith Warner, the author of \"Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety\" and a contributing columnist for TimesSelect, will be a guest columnist through the end of July.",

   "This brings up some interesting points. \n \n I firmly believe that if we had a greater health care system where going to the doctor isn't going to cost a month's salary for many then we may see a decline in the number of abortions done.\n \n Many women cite their lack of financial resources as a reason they have an abortion. I think starting with providing some kind of decent health care for them will make a difference, if only to more adoptions than abortions. And of course, this will ultimately benefit the health of the child.\n \n I don't have insurance. I've worked for the same company, in a responsible role, for over three years. They keep me just under the # of hours required to provide health insurance, because it is so expensive for them. As a result, I don't get to the doctors. I can only go to the ER if I have an emergency and only at one hospital in town, because I know that they have a system where if you don't have insurance, they will look at your pay stubs and determine the rate you will pay. This hospital is not at all appealing, the wait is ridiculous, and the staff just doesn't care. It's appalling, and humiliating. When I was in agony over a kidney stone, I'm waiting with people who are drunk, homeless folks just looking for a free sandwich, drug dealers, prostitutes, etc.\n \n I never want to raise a family under these kind of circumstances, and I'm sure I'm not alone.\n \n We all need to work for changes so that the abortion #'s decline.",

I am truly going to try and answer your question. You make a valid point that deserves a good answer.\n \n Your stated view of sexuality above is very narrow. Sexualilty is not solely about having intercourse. There is far more to it than that. Abstinence is a valid and viable and 100% effective method of contraception. \n \n To just embrace a sexual encounter to include intercourse automatically turns it into a \"you use me\" or \"I use you\" situation. It is simply one person trying to get off and using another to do it. Whether or not people are consenting you cannot remove emotional entanglement from the equation because we are emotional beings. To refuse is to engage in self value. To know that you are worth more than a romp in the hay. \n \n My belief is that by saving it for a long term committed relationship eliminates the using part. Then it is an act of love as one person gives themself to another as a gift. This doesn't occur in a one night stand because it is always unequal. We are humans. It cannot be otherwise.\n \n Still then will a committed couple be able to handle parenthood. No One is ever READY to be a parent. But to simply eliminate the possibility of a life because it is inconvenient is very self centered.\n \n EF",

   "I am a mother of three small children. I am stressed out, frustrated, and alwyas tired. Yes, this all occurred because I had kids. However, I could never give up my children. As for those people who truly feel that they are not cut out to be parents, there are other options. Abstinence is a good way, but many people do not save themselves for marriage, and there are also couples who do not feel that either of them are cut out to be parents. However, there are many couples out there longing to be parents, but who are unable to have children of their own. Why not simply give the baby up for adoption? Now that open adoptions have become so popular the parents (or parent) giving up the child can actually interview couples to ensure that the baby is placed in the best possible home. And these couple are usually willing to pay all the medical costs as well. the only reason I can see for someone in this situation choosing abortion over adoption is vanity. The woman is concerned about her looks and how a pregnancy might negatively affect them. Personally, I think that is the dumbest reason anyone can give for having an abortion. As for the high cost of health care being a factor, if you truly cannot afford health care, even if you have insurance through work, most states will offer you medical to cover the deductibles. It's only good during the pregnancy and for the post-partum check-up, but it eliminates that potential excuse.",

Why did you say \"if you truly cannot afford health care\" ? Do you think people are trying to scam the system? Do you think women just make up the excuse that they can't afford health care?)\n \n Other than that, and I would like to know more about this system in place in which the state helps out.
