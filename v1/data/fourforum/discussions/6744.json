   "But how can we make rules without legal lines in sand? At least its better than an illegal line.\nThe trouble is that nearly all of the discussion in the abortion debate sets that legal line in the sand at one of two points - at conception (meaning no abortion allowed) or at birth (meaning abortion always allowed). This is far too restrictive. Once could set that \"legal line in the sand\" anywhere within the ~9 months of pregnancy. Why do we restrict ourselves to those two extremes? Is it simply out of fear of the slippery slope - \"give an inch, they'll take a mile\"? If so, then that would be tragic.\n \n The trouble is that both sides have emotionally charged arguements to present. The emotional draw to the pro-life side relies on sympathy for the fetus. I, and probably most pro-choice supporters, can understand the empathy that pro-life people have for a late term fetus. There isn't much difference after all between a fetus one day before birth and a newly born baby. However, that sympathy mostly disappears when you are talking about a newly fertilized egg. It's hard to feel the same sense of empathy to a batch of a dozen cells soon after conception - that has no mind, emotions, thought, sense of pain, etc. That is why the pro-life movement almost invariably uses images of late-term fetuses to draw emotional support - not early embryos. As for the emotional draw of the pro-choice movement, most people can sympathize with a person's sense of rights over their own body. I suspect that such sympathy is lacking among pro-life supporters since they feel that those women who would want an abortion are morally \"bad\" and deserve any suffering brought about by carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term. \n \n If pro-life proponents would be willing to stop at outlawing only late-term abortions, then a much higher percentage of Americans might support that. Unfortunately, pro-life sticks to the extreme of no abortions. Pro-choice supporters are afraid of incremental laws restricting abortion mostly out of fear of that slippery slope.",

(Again, please only answer if you consider yourself pro-choice.)\n\n \n Well, from a personal viewpoint this is roughly the position I support (which is also that of UK law). Elective abortion is legal until the 24th week of pregnancy, at which point the child has a good chance of surviving birth. After that time an abortion can only be granted on medical grounds or if the mother is judged to pose a threat to herself if denied an abortion. \n \n This does still allow late term abortions to be carried out if the child is found to have a number of diseases/disorders that are judged to to severe enough. However, some allowances are controversial such as allowing a late abortion to be carried out if the child has a cleft pallet or Down's Syndrome for example- these being matters that I wouldn't claim to have a good answer too (having recently given much thought to as baby number 1 is on the way).\n \n I don't see a slippery slope issue to restriction of abortion services in the UK based upon this approach- if anything elective abortion may become less available in the future as neonatal care of very premature babies improves.",

   "Does this mean that the legal \"line in the sand\" will move as technology improves to care for even earlier premature babies? Also, given the current limit against third term abortions, what is the popular support in the UK for pushing that limit earlier?\n\n \n I would say yes, based on past evidence. The 1967 Abortion act originally allowed elective abortion up to the 28th week of pregnancy, but this was reduced to the 24th week in 1990 when the act was amended, much in light of advances in neonatal care. This law is based on the notion that a woman can choose to have an abortion up until the point where the child has a substantial chance of surviving birth and infancy, at which point the state recognises the baby as a legal person.\n \n In the 2004 Geenral Election the abortion issue received some publicity when the notion of reducing the elective limit to 22 or even 20 weeks was raised by a Catholic Bishop (IIRC). This then lead to predictably ambigious comments from the main party leaders when the media and press put the question to them regarding their opinion on the matter.\n \n Significantly, the proposition did not receive support from the British Medical Association who hold alot of clout in this debate so it very much fell by the wayside- the political parties would not oppose the will of the BMA on an issue like abortion.\n \n As for popular support for a reduction in access to abortion in the UK that is something that is harder to gauge. The Pro-life camp is much smaller here than in the US and lacks political influence (except through the Church) and the general outlook on the matter seems to be that the law has it more or less right as things currently stand.

A story logically begins at the beginning, but this story is about the universe and unfortunately there are no data for the very beginnings--none, zero.

The experience is the same for everyone and is repeatable over and over. With religion, no one (except possibly a very select few) has any experiences to confirm a particular belief or assumption. If one person claims to have an experience, he has no way of making others believe since they will not be able to experience it as well, no matter what their effort or knowledge is. With science, the experiences of one scientist can and are reproduced by other scientists. Otherwise, they are not fully trusted. Indeed, anyone can reproduce the results and believe for themselves (as long as they have the resources to reproduce the experiment and the knowledge to understand it). That is part of the essence of objectivity - anyone can have the same experience.",

Just because all humans always have experienced the existence of the world, doesn't mean that it is 100.00% certain, just that the probability that it is true approaches 100.00% (say, 99.9999999%). The greater the amount of evidence, the closer that certainty is to 100.00%. That 0.0000001% leaves room for obsurd scenarios - such as that an omnicient being is causing us all to merely imagine our reality, or the scenario of the movie \"The Matrix\". These can be fun to ponder (especially in a social situation after a few drinks ;) ), but no one takes them seriously. If anyone did seriously live by the idea that the world may not exist, they would quickly do something stupid and die, or change their minds. \n \n I, and most people, have a firm assumption, based on all of our and all human's experience, that the world that we live in exists and that our experiences of the moment are real.

   "*Phew* back out of the metaphysical cul-de-sacemoticon_xclown \n \n \nThat makes me wonder how the balance would shift here in the US if third trimester abortions were mainly outlawed (with the usual exceptions). We on the pro-choice side are often afraid of the slippery-slope but there might actually be a political advantage to a third-term abortion restriction law being introduced. Namely, much of the emotional appeal of the pro-life movement would be satisfied with such a move. It would be much harder for pro-life proponents to show images of first-trimester embryos/fetuses to gain proponents since such images hold much less emotional appeal, whereas the emotional appeal of pro-choice proponents (in having women have rights over their own bodies) would still stand.\n\n \n I agree that the approach of strong pro-life advocates puts the back of even a hesitant pro-choicer up because their intent always seems to have no room for compromise and that they will settle for nothing less than everything they demand. When one takes a step back and considers abortion as a whole, late term elective abortions are certainly the most evocotive single issue. Once a baby has developed so far as to be able to survive birth (once you reach 29 weeks the child has over 90% chance of surviving if born).\n \n Take that away (3rd trimester elective abortion) and we could speculate a large number of everyday people unsure on the issue or slightly against abortion would be satisified by the compromise.\n \n I can see such a move posing a major problem to the lawmakers though- could such a compromise sit in the framework of Roe vs. Wade? From what I know of that ruling I don't think it would due to the all or nothing nature of the precedent.\n \n I wonder what Jitobear and simone would make of such a change?",

   "\n If the unborn got all protections under the law and equal protection under the law (not referring to the 14th amendment here) then abortion would have to be illegal.\n\n \n \n\n Seems to me that Steeeeve is correct. The key word in his statement is the first one, \"if\". That is what the issue seems to be all about\n\n \n For this to be logically true, a person must currently have the right to live attached to another person against that other's will and without the other's consent. Then, and only then, would there be any case that equal protection would necessarily give the fetus this ability.\n \n Is this currently the case?",

   "Roe is not an all-or-nothing precedent, it only covers until viability. After that States can restrict it. Restricting late-term abortion would sit just fine, and the majority of the country would support such a move. \nThis makes me wonder how many people really realize that Roe does not protect third-term abortions on demand. I have to admit that I wasn't clear on the issue either and my guess is that most people assume that Roe allows for on-demand abortions in all trimesters. Perhaps this is something that should be advertised so that the public can be educated on the issue - especially given the use of third-trimester abortion images by the pro-life movement to gather supporters. \n \n My answer to the pro-life protesters in those states that have already outlawed third-term abortions would be \"You XXXXXX ... abortion of fetuses that you show in those images has ALREADY been outlawed. Get a clue.\"",
