   "I have always felt that the poor job of science education that we do in the U.S. was a disgrace. But on the other hand I was encouraged by the fact that our universities are a Mecca for students of science from all over the world. I thought that the science education available in our universities was second to none. It seems that I was wrong. Maybe we are still doing an adequate job due to the efforts of the teachers in the science departments, but how long can that last wen faced with the erosion of sanity at the top.\n Cowardice, Creationism and Science Education: An Open Letter to the Universities from SciAm Perspectives.\n \n Especially disgraceful is the President of the University of Texas, who claims to be a scientist.",

I do agree that the arguments against the teaching of evolution in school are full of holes and are causing a debate that could dramatically hinder the education of our students. It is very difficult to teach and understand Biology without also understanding evolution. But I have just graduated from college in Michigan, and I believe that my education was very good. In fact, I'm going back for more!",

For an obvious example of the bias, consider where and by who the prizes are awarded and then take a look at the country in question and answer me why a country with a population of 9 million people would have more groundbreaking scientists and discoveries than three continents combined.. ;)\n \n Sweden ranks at place number 5 on the list of Nobel Price laureates with 30 prices between 1901-2002... That`s 3,15 prices per 1 million people. The equivalent figure for other countries with the highest nobel price laureate per capita is: \n \n Iceland: 3,57\n Denmark: 2,6 \n Norway: 1,79\n UK: 1,67 \n Switzerland: 1,5\n Austria: 1,345\n Germany: 0,939\n Netherlands: 0,938\n US: 0,93\n France: 0,817\n \n As you can see, only iceland ranks higher than Sweden. This is largely because they have such a small population (280,798) and has 1 nobel price laureate. \n \n Now, even I as a Swede cannot claim that these figures acuratly reflect scientific success with a straight face. Also notice how every Nordic country rank in at the top (with the exeption of Finland). Bias, prejudice and ethno-centrisism in the Swedish Royal Academy and Karolinska institutet is the only possible explanation for this result...\n \n Oh, and source for the figures: Map & Graph: People: Nobel prize laureates (Top 50 Countries), Nationmaster.com and Map & Graph: People: Population, Nationmaster.com ",

   "Even though the title does not specify science, my OP and the article make it clear that I was talking about science education. In fact, 4th grade students in the U.S. rate near the top when compared to students of a similar age from around the world. By the time they reach 8th grade, U.S. students rank near the middle. By 12th grade U.S. students rank near the bottom - I think we out-scored Somolia and one other country. This explains why creationism can dupe people with the idea of \"creation science.\" We are turning out high school graduates who are for the most part scientifically illiterate. The lack the presence of mind and the education to recognize as scientific nonsense the pap being passed out by people like Hovind and Ham.\n \n Then consider that Japan has about 1/2 of the population of the U.S. and theat Japan graduates about twice as many engineers and scientists from her universities.\n \n As a former scientist and educator, I was then aware and am still aware of the less than adequate job we are doing on the primary and secondary levels.\n \n I had always thought that we were doing a better job at the university level, and I think that we probably still are. So what if the majority of our high school students are unable to cut the grade in the sciences and engineering because of the poor preparation they received in high school? The faculties of our engineering and science departments are still teaching science. And as always, they aren't baby sitters who waste time in remedial education.\n \n But the article is the handwriting on the wall. The administrations of our universities have gone wishy-washy. They are afraid to stand up for superior science education for fear of offending people who believe mythology and moon dust and shrinking sun lies. It is the beginning of the end. Jaxian may have gotten a good education, but is that in science or engineering and will that be possible in 10 years when our universities will be teaching that a universal flood is a reasonable alternative theory to explain geology?\n \n I don't resent good science being done in other countries. Good for them. What I do resent is the dumbing down of the science in this country that will make us a 3rd world nation in the future. Even the National Academy of Sciences in the book Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences lays the blame for the deteriorating state of secondary scientific education at the feet of \"creation science\" fundamentalists, scientifically illiterate and faith motivated.",

   "Yes; off at a tangent here (and not for the first time): but here's a few other general observations, if permitted.\n \n The problem of low standards in education is not confined to science subjects, or to America. For instance, I've noted the exasperation of former colleagues giving \"crash\" courses in remedial mathematics to students who are supposed to be registered for engineering degrees. In my own field of \"expertise\" which was (or, I like to believe, still is) the teaching of English, it has been apparent for some years that the university student who can write a logically constructed paragraph without a litter of mistakes in spelling, grammar, and punctuation, is becoming a rarity.\n \n Scientific ignorance, semi-literacy, innumeracy, and so on, seem to be the products of an educational \"philosophy\" that has undermined standards to a point where, apart from cultural anxieties, even a mere \"philistine\" concern for the future of our competitive edge is justified.\n \n The blame for this problem starts, I conjecture, at primary and secondary school level. Children are no longer exposed to the rigour and discipline of a subject orientated curriculum and expected to master certain basic skills and to acquire a body of knowledge, etc. Instead a \"child-centred\" approach has introduced talk about \"feelings\" and \"fun\" in place of the serious application required to surmount the admitted difficulties of learning anything worthwhile. Perhaps I exaggerate a little here, but not much.\n \n There is no sign at present (at least here in the UK) of any significant change in this state of educational affairs. Dumbing down shows few signs of being eliminated from schools: sentimental humbug about promoting \"self esteem\" as an educational end - perhaps the educational end - continues to produce very poorly prepared and even deeply ignorant applicants for places at universities. It is probable that the study of the sciences suffers most from this lack of adequate primary education - the objectivity of science offers far less scope for the \"waffle\" that is tolerated by the elasticity of arts subjects.\n \n Excuse the \"scare quotes\" all over the place, but my sense of irony often gets in the way of a dispassionate discourse.",

(at least comparatively).\n\n \n \n Can't agree about the current state of American education. Since most Nobel Laureates are in their 50's and 60's, these statistics indicate that as of about 35-40 years ago, the US education system was in good shape. We'll have to wait and see if the situation is the same in another 40 years to assess the current situation.\n \n And of course the US will have more Nobel prizes; as one of the more populous developed countries there will naturally be a larger pool of humanity from which to pull.",

I hope the situation is improving there; guess we'll find out in 50 years.\n \n Another factor that contributed was the fact that there are more remote and undeveloped areas in the former USSR than in the US, which supports the idea that parts of the Soviet Union were (and may still be) less developed.",
