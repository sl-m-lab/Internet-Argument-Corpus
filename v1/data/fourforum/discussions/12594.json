   "One thing always overlooked in the proposals to register guns. How exactly would writing down my name, or your name, and what firearm(s) we have, help arrest criminals or make you safer? Never mind the historical fact that registration has been followed by confiscation in every case. Although at first glance, gun registration has a sort of tantalizing appeal, on reflection you have to wonder whether gun lists would be an instrument of crime control at all. The unfortunate answer is that, no matter how good it feels when the words first pass your ears, registering honest gun owners doesn't stop criminals, and in fact focuses in exactly the opposite direction. It is an allocation of resources that has no chance of achieving its goal, if that goal is the reduction of crime. It certainly doesn't prevent crime. \n \n Like many gun control laws, Canada's Firearms Act was peddled as a badly needed \"tool\" against crime. But the Canadian government's own numbers tell a different story. Sprawled across five time zones, Canada historically has had a very low rate of gun-related crime. Even Austin, the Justice Department spokesman, concedes that gun-related crimes and gun-related deaths, whether homicide, suicide or accidental, have been in steady decline for the past several years. \n \n In 1995, the previous government told Parliament that the firearms program, most specifically the long-gun registry, would involve a net cost of just $2 million CAD(Auditor General's Report 2002, Chapter 10). \n In May 2000, the previous government admitted that the costs had actually ballooned to at least $327 million (Auditor General's Report 2002, Chapter 10). \n By March 2005 the net cost of the firearms program was $946 million and by summer of 2006, costs had exceeded $1 billion. The Auditor General stated that Parliament was misinformed about many of these costs. (Auditor General's Report 2006, Chapter 4). \n Neither the costs incurred by provincial and territorial agencies in enforcing the legislation, nor the costs borne by Firearms owners and businesses to comply with the legislation have been calculated. (Auditor General's Report 2002, Chapter 10). \n Two Library of Parliament studies estimate that the enforcement and compliance costs are substantial, running into hundreds of millions of dollars. (Compliance Costs of Firearms Registration, 10 October 2003; and, Estimates of Some of the Costs of Enforcing the Firearms Act, 20 March 2003). \n \n The government has been unable to come up with a true figue despite numerous audits or attempts at them. Seems the audit trail often goes off into limbo. Does that sound familiar? Like our own interior department under Bruce Babbit losing 5 Billion. \n \n And what will these billions of Canadian's taxpayers' dollars have bought? The number of employees at the Canadian Firearms Center, which administers the registry, and associated government agencies have grown from a handful of employees in 1995 to 600 employees in mid-1999, and over 1,700 by July 2000. \n \n All of this growth in Canadian gun bureaucrats has come at the expense of other government agencies. During the same period the Canadian Firearms Center grew from nothing to nearly 2,000 employees, the total number of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers declined.The RCMP budget stayed roughly flat. RCMP salaries were frozen for seven years and training was reduced. \n \n Roughly a decade ago, Canada instituted their gun registration program. Although initially it was only supposed to cost taxpayers 2 million CAD (with the remainder of the 200 million CAD cost paid for with registration fees). As the program has continued over the last decade, the cost has now risen to over 2 billion CAD, and police groups all over Canada are starting to lobby against it, as it has had zero impact on the ability of police to prevent or solve crimes, a track record Canada's registration program shares with those tried in the United States. And it hasn't been completed despite numerous extensions of deadlines!\n \n And how has gun registration helped Canada? Deputy Prime Minister Herb Gray admitted that the gun registration system has never helped solve a single firearms crime. So the only real reason behind registration is so the government know who has them and where they are. Then its a simple matter to round them up once the government makes them illegal. ",
