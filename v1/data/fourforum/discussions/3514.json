In conclusion, we found no WMD's and we lost over 300 tons of conventional explosives \"sometime\" between then and now. Is that a fair depiction of the events?\n\n \n No need to simply. I fully comprehend the situation. I'll break it down for you. Saddam was under UN sanctions, and therefore to receive humanitarian aid the UN regularly went into Iraq to check to make sure he wasn't spending money set aside for humanitarian aid for weapons (turns out the UN, France, Germany, and maybe Russia were bought off by Saddam). Also, Saddam had to answer to the IAEA when he moved, used, or destroyed any of his weapons. The IAEA also periodically checked his stockpiles (the ones he would let them check) to reconcile their records with what Saddam actually had. The last time they checked his stockpiles at the alleged cache in Al-Qaqaa was in January 2003, where they sealed the weapons with the IAEA stamp. We arrived at Al-Qaqaa in April of 2003, and when we arrived there we found no HDX or RDX explosives or IAEA sealed weapons, which was the main component in the cache of explosives. Another more extensive search in May 2003 concluded that there was no HDX or RDX at the site or IAEA seals.\n \n The timeline, assuming the IAEA correctly accounted for the explosives in January, shows that the weapons must have left the site between January and April. We did not take over Baghdad until April, so how were we supposed to infiltrate the city and secure a weapons dump? So, yes we obviously knew there was supposed to be weapons there. However, when we got there no explosives were present. The only conclusion I can infer from your judgement is that \"we let the weapons get away under our watch\", which is completely false. There was nothing there when we got there.\n \n Our objective was to topple Saddam and secure his \"WDMs\". That's exactly what we tried to do when we got there. As soon as we got to Al-Qaqaa in April 2003 we inspected the site, and no explosives were there. So what were we supposed to secure?\n \n And to provide further evidence that the weapons were not lost or stolen under our watch, here is a scenario. First of all, 380 tons of explosives is 760,000 pounds. This can't simply be carried out in the trunk of a car, semi, tank, or a plane for that matter. It would apparently take 20 18-wheelers stacked to the brim to remove all of the explosives. That isn't too easy to conceal. 18-wheelers are very limited in use in Iraq, and I highly doubt we let 18-wheelers just drive around in Iraq without checking at least some of their contents. It would have taken some act of God to remove these explosives without the US having any trace of it. Couple this with the NBC reporter and the 101st battallion's claims that there were no weapons when they got there, and the extensive check in May 2003 which revealed no explosives at the dump, and it is pretty easy to put 2 and 2 together and deduce that these weapons were either:\n \n a) Relocated or hidden somewhere else in Iraq by Saddam before our invasion\n b) Sold to another country or terrorists organization by Saddam\n c) Stolen from the site before our invasion\n \n I find it extremely hard to believe that we could miss all 380 tons of explosives leaving the site with no trace of them leaving whatsoever. It is virtually impossible.",

It wasn't there when we invaded Iraq, unless you claim NBC, its reporter, and the 101st battalion are all liars. I highly doubt the IAEA would allow Saddam to have 400 tons of explosives, when 1 single pound could easily take out an airplane? What need did he have for 400 tons of deadly explosives?\nMay I refer you to the White House Press Briefing 10/25/04. http://www.whitehouse.gov\n \n It's all interesting, but I bolded the best part:\n \n Q The Kerry campaign is hitting you on this story in the New York Times today that a large cache of explosives have gone missing. Is there anything you could have done about that? \n \n MR. McCLELLAN: Maybe the best way to do this is kind of walk you through how we came to be informed about this. The Iraqi Interim Government informed -- told the IAEA -- the International Atomic Energy Agency on October 10th that there were approximately 350 tons of high explosives missing from Al Qaqaa in Iraq. And they informed the IAEA because these munitions were subject to IAEA monitoring, because they were considered dual-use materials. And the International Atomic Energy Agency informed the United States mission in Vienna on October 15th about these -- this cache of explosives that was missing because of some looting that went on in Iraq toward the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom, or during and toward the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom. \n \n Q When did the President find out? \n \n MR. McCLELLAN: That's why I said, we were informed on October 15th. Condi Rice was informed days after that. This is all in the last, what, 10 days now. \n \n Q She was informed days after October 15th? \n \n MR. McCLELLAN: Yes, and she informed the President. And the first priority, from our standpoint, was to make sure that this wasn't a nuclear proliferation risk, which it is not. These are conventional high explosives that we are talking about. And the President wants to make sure that we get to the bottom of this. Now, the Pentagon, upon learning of this, directed the multinational forces and the Iraqi survey group to look into this matter, and that's what they are currently doing.\n \n -----------------------------------------\n So, they just found out and they're \"looking into this matter\". Why bother if they know when it went missing?\n \n -----------------------------------------\n \n As for NBC. Because of claims like yours, they were forced to clarify on last evening's report. They want it known that they didn't find any because they didn't look for any. It's a facility of up to 1,000 locked buildings. They simply made camp there and moved on. They never made any attempt to look for explosives. The reporter can't say what was or wasn't there. Baghdad was their objective. So, that's the defense? We didn't get them because we didn't try? There were looters there but we didn't stop them? This was a known and identified site.\n \n I'm sure you can find the NBC website. There's a video of the report.\n \n \nI find it extremely hard to believe that we could miss all 380 tons of explosives leaving the site with no trace of them leaving whatsoever. It is virtually impossible.\nWhy. It's in the middle of a desert unguarded. They had virtually unlimited time to take it.\n \n GWB just wants this story to go away. Don't you?",

   "Update from NYTimes\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/27/politics/27bomb.html?oref=login\n \n \nhite House officials reasserted yesterday that 380 tons of powerful explosives may have disappeared from a vast Iraqi military complex while Saddam Hussein controlled Iraq, saying a brigade of American soldiers did not find the explosives when they visited the complex on April 10, 2003, the day after Baghdad fell.\n \n But the unit's commander said in an interview yesterday that his troops had not searched the site and had merely stopped there overnight.  \n \n The commander, Col. Joseph Anderson, of the Second Brigade of the Army's 101st Airborne Division, said he did not learn until this week that the site, Al Qaqaa, was considered sensitive, or that international inspectors had visited it before the war began in 2003 to inspect explosives that they had tagged during a decade of monitoring. \n \n We happened to stumble on it,'' he said. \"I didn't know what the place was supposed to be. We did not get involved in any of the bunkers. It was not our mission. It was not our focus. We were just stopping there on our way to Baghdad. The plan was to leave that very same day. The plan was not to go in there and start searching. It looked like all the other ammunition supply points we had seen already.\"\n \n Earlier this month, officials of the interim Iraqi government informed the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency that the explosives disappeared sometime after the fall of Mr. Hussein on April 9, 2003. Al Qaqaa, which has been unguarded since the American invasion, was looted in the spring of 2003, and looters were seen there as recently as Sunday.\n \n The 101st Airborne Division arrived April 10 and left the next day. The next recorded visit by Americans came on May 27, when Task Force 75 inspected Al Qaqaa, but did not find the large quantities of explosives that had been seen in mid-March by the international inspectors. By then, Al Qaqaa had plainly been looted.\n \n Colonel Anderson said he did not see any obvious signs of damage when he arrived on April 10, but that his focus was strictly on finding a secure place to collect his troops, who were driving and flying north from Karbala.  \n \"There was no sign of looting here,\" Colonel Anderson said. \"Looting was going on in Baghdad, and we were rushing on to Baghdad. We were marshaling in.\"\n \n \"I had given instructions, 'Don't mess around with those. It looks like they are bunkers; we're not messing around with those things. That's not what we're here for,' \" he said. \"I thought we would be there for a few hours and move on. We ended up staying overnight.\"\n \n",

We were marshaling in.\" \n \n Here is a quote from CBS news...\"But Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said coalition forces were present in the vicinity of the site both during and after major combat operations, which ended May 1, 2003 - and searched the facility but found none of the explosives material in question. That raised the possibility that the explosives had disappeared before U.S. soldiers could secure the site in the immediate invasion aftermath.\"\n \n (http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/27/iraq/main651607.shtml)\n \n What is interesting is this story is 19 months old. Why did it just somehow find its way into the news 7 days before a re-election bid for George Bush, who is hated by the IAEA and the UN? Why did it all of a sudden become a concern? Also, why did CBS plan to wait and air it the Sunday for the election, just 48 hours before Americans head to the polls?\n \n Something else I found interesting was that the IAEA and the UN were supposed to dismantle this stockpile in 1995...\n \n \"Duelfer also said U.N. weapons inspectors recommended in 1995 that the high explosives be destroyed because of their potential use in a nuclear weapons program. The International Atomic Energy Agency instead ordered the explosives stored in sealed bunkers 30 miles south of the Iraqi capital. The last time the IAEA verified that the bunkers were still sealed was in March of last year, about a month before the first U.S. troops moved into the complex as they pushed toward Baghdad.\"\n \n (http://cbsnewyork.com/topstories/topstories_story_301083936.html)\n \n Did the IAEA actually think that simply sealing these weapons would deter Saddam from using or selling them? If they didn't want him to use them, why didn't they remove them from his arsenal rather than let him keep them? That's like letting a serial killer continue to own a gun, but a BATF seal on it, rather than simply take it from him. And if they wanted to seal them, seal them somewhere else rather than in a close proximity to Saddam's palaces. It sounds like the IAEA did a poor job of handling this situation and made an egregious mistake in allowing this thug to keep 400 tons of explosives. What good did he have for 400 tons of explosives but to kill people?",

   "http://insider.washingtontimes.com/articles/normal.php?StoryID=20041028-122637-6257r\n \n Russia tied to Iraq's missing arms\n By Bill Gertz\n THE WASHINGTON TIMES\n From the Nation/Politics section\n Russian special forces troops moved many of Saddam Hussein's weapons and related goods out of Iraq and into Syria in the weeks before the March 2003 U.S. military operation, The Washington Times has learned. \n \n John A. Shaw, the deputy undersecretary of defense for international technology security, said in an interview that he believes the Russian troops, working with Iraqi intelligence, \"almost certainly\" removed the high-explosive material that went missing from the Al-Qaqaa facility, south of Baghdad. \n \"The Russians brought in, just before the war got started, a whole series of military units,\" Mr. Shaw said. \"Their main job was to shred all evidence of any of the contractual arrangements they had with the Iraqis. The others were transportation units.\" \n \n Mr. Shaw, who was in charge of cataloging the tons of conventional arms provided to Iraq by foreign suppliers, said he recently obtained reliable information on the arms-dispersal program from two European intelligence services that have detailed knowledge of the Russian-Iraqi weapons collaboration. \n \n Most of Saddam's most powerful arms were systematically separated from other arms like mortars, bombs and rockets, and sent to Syria and Lebanon, and possibly to Iran, he said. \n \n The Russian involvement in helping disperse Saddam's weapons, including some 380 tons of RDX and HMX, is still being investigated, Mr. Shaw said. \n The RDX and HMX, which are used to manufacture high-explosive and nuclear weapons, are probably of Russian origin, he said. \n \n Pentagon spokesman Larry DiRita could not be reached for comment. \n The disappearance of the material was reported in a letter Oct. 10 from the Iraqi government to the International Atomic Energy Agency. \n \n \n Disclosure of the missing explosives Monday in a New York Times story was used by the Democratic presidential campaign of Sen. John Kerry, who accused the Bush administration of failing to secure the material. \n \n Al-Qaqaa, a known Iraqi weapons site, was monitored closely, Mr. Shaw said. \n \"That was such a pivotal location, Number 1, that the mere fact of [special explosives] disappearing was impossible,\" Mr. Shaw said. \"And Number 2, if the stuff disappeared, it had to have gone before we got there.\" \n \n The Pentagon disclosed yesterday that the Al-Qaqaa facility was defended by Fedayeen Saddam, Special Republican Guard and other Iraqi military units during the conflict. U.S. forces defeated the defenders around April 3 and found the gates to the facility open, the Pentagon said in a statement yesterday. \n \n A military unit in charge of searching for weapons, the Army's 75th Exploitation Task Force, then inspected Al-Qaqaa on May 8, May 11 and May 27, 2003, and found no high explosives that had been monitored in the past by the IAEA.\n \n The Pentagon said there was no evidence of large-scale movement of explosives from the facility after April 6. \n \n \"The movement of 377 tons of heavy ordnance would have required dozens of heavy trucks and equipment moving along the same roadways as U.S. combat divisions occupied continually for weeks prior to and subsequent to the 3rd Infantry Division's arrival at the facility,\" the statement said. \n The statement also said that the material may have been removed from the site by Saddam's regime. \n \n According to the Pentagon, U.N. arms inspectors sealed the explosives at Al-Qaqaa in January 2003 and revisited the site in March and noted that the seals were not broken.\n \n It is not known whether the inspectors saw the explosives in March. The U.N. team left the country before the U.S.-led invasion began March 20, 2003.\n \n A second defense official said documents on the Russian support to Iraq reveal that Saddam's government paid the Kremlin for the special forces to provide security for Iraq's Russian arms and to conduct counterintelligence activities designed to prevent U.S. and Western intelligence services from learning about the arms pipeline through Syria. \n \n The Russian arms-removal program was initiated after Yevgeny Primakov, the former Russian intelligence chief, could not persuade Saddam to give in to U.S. and Western demands, this official said. \n \n A small portion of Iraq's 650,000 tons to 1 million tons of conventional arms that were found after the war were looted after the U.S.-led invasion, Mr. Shaw said. Russia was Iraq's largest foreign supplier of weaponry, he said. \n However, the most important and useful arms and explosives appear to have been separated and moved out as part of carefully designed program. \"The organized effort was done in advance of the conflict,\" Mr. Shaw said. \n \n The Russian forces were tasked with moving special arms out of the country. \n Mr. Shaw said foreign intelligence officials believe the Russians worked with Saddam's Mukhabarat intelligence service to separate out special weapons, including high explosives and other arms and related technology, from standard conventional arms spread out in some 200 arms depots.\n \n The Russian weapons were then sent out of the country to Syria, and possibly Lebanon in Russian trucks, Mr. Shaw said.\n \n Mr. Shaw said he believes that the withdrawal of Russian-made weapons and explosives from Iraq was part of plan by Saddam to set up a \"redoubt\" in Syria that could be used as a base for launching pro-Saddam insurgency operations in Iraq. \n \n The Russian units were dispatched beginning in January 2003 and by March had destroyed hundreds of pages of documents on Russian arms supplies to Iraq while dispersing arms to Syria, the second official said. \n \n Besides their own weapons, the Russians were supplying Saddam with arms made in Ukraine, Belarus, Bulgaria and other Eastern European nations, he said. \n \n \"Whatever was not buried was put on lorries and sent to the Syrian border,\" the defense official said. \n \n Documents reviewed by the official included itineraries of military units involved in the truck shipments to Syria. The materials outlined in the documents included missile components, MiG jet parts, tank parts and chemicals used to make chemical weapons, the official said. \n \n The director of the Iraqi government front company known as the Al Bashair Trading Co. fled to Syria, where he is in charge of monitoring arms holdings and funding Iraqi insurgent activities, the official said.\n \n Also, an Arabic-language report obtained by U.S. intelligence disclosed the extent of Russian armaments. The 26-page report was written by Abdul Tawab Mullah al Huwaysh, Saddam's minister of military industrialization, who was captured by U.S. forces May 2, 2003.\n \n The Russian \"spetsnaz\" or special-operations forces were under the GRU military intelligence service and organized large commercial truck convoys for the weapons removal, the official said. \n \n Regarding the explosives, the new Iraqi government reported that 194.7 metric tons of HMX, or high-melting-point explosive, and 141.2 metric tons of RDX, or rapid-detonation explosive, and 5.8 metric tons of PETN, or pentaerythritol tetranitrate, were missing.\n \n The material is used in nuclear weapons and also in making military \"plastic\" high explosive.\n \n Defense officials said the Russians can provide information on what happened to the Iraqi weapons and explosives that were transported out of the country. \n \n Officials believe the Russians also can explain what happened to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs.",
