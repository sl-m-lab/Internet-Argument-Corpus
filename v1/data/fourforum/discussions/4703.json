   "Hydrogen is going to have to be created, currently through the conversion of Natural gas to pure hydrogen. This of course takes energy to convert Methane or Ethane to just hydrogen and byproducts ( not sure what happens to the carbon ) \n \n In the future it may be made through electrolosis (conversion of water to hydrogen and oxygen) which is a very energy intensive process.\n \n Then you have to compress the hydrogen to a volume that would be able to fit within a cars storage tank. If you have seen propane tanks in cars or trucks, a hydrogen tank would have to be made stronger and I believe thermally insulated to handle hydrogen. The compression of hydrogen is also very energy intensive (lost energy as well).\n \n In comparison though a fuel cell is extremely efficient, it does not have thermal energy losses. An internal combustion engine if I recall correctly loses between 40-60% of the potential energy that its fuel has too heat. A fuel cell would be I believe 80-95% efficient in that regard.\n \n Current fuel cells are very expensive in partially because of the expensive materials ( catalysts?) like Palladium, Platinium I believe.",

If that is true, then would we still not be tied to a fossil fuel (oil) as a provider of our hydrogen cells ? And I wonder what the hydrogen cells, recharging units, whatever, will cost us as compared to gasoline ?\n\n \n The problem with hydrogen is that it is exremely volitile, so there is VERY little of it in nature. Currently, the cheapest way to get hydrogen is by steam reforming it from natural gas. The ROEI (return on energy investment ) for this is terrible. Efficincy for reforming hydrogen from natural gas is 72%, and is not likely to rise. That means that in creating hydrogen, you loose 28% of the energy in your natural gas. \n \n You can also crack hydrogen from other fossil fuels (pretty much any hydrocarbon), but thisis even more expensive than steam reformation.\n \n The third popular method (or popular mythical economically viable way to) produce hydrogen is through electrolysis. Electrolysis is 70% efficient. It uses electricity to work, which comes mostly from fossil fuel power plants which are 30% efficient. Essentially, you end up burning 4 units of energy in the form of electricty to create one unit of energy in the form of hydorgen, no tot mention the fact that you need a platinum electrode. A TEN GRM or bigger paltinum electrode (take a look at the price of platinum, which is vurrently mostly used for jewelry, then imagine the price doubling or tripleing due to demand for elctordes). In addition, the electrodes must be REPLACED. They are consumables in the system. The current fuel cells in research for vehicle use use 10-15 grams of platinum, and only have a life of 200 hours. It takes 286kJ of energy per mole to make hydrogen from water. This is a constant that cannot be reduced. \n \n At the end of the day, the hydrogen fuel economy is a myth that people have been sold by politicians. There is no such thing, nor will there likely ever be. Sure, it is a great dream, pour water in your carsgas tank and drive around forever without pollution. Unfortunatly, the phsical realities of the thing are much different.",

I dont know what the solution is, but the \"too many vehicles\" problem, is GROWING fast , and I do not see it slowing down. jmo\n\n \n \n I get publications from the local extension office regarding environmentally friendly farming practices and non-chemical intensive farming. Since the farming on my land is done on shares, with somebody else doing the actual work, and my prime consideration is not yield but provision of habitat for game, I take a great deal of interest in these.\n \n Recently, a booklet crossed my desk about non-petroleum intensive farming. According tot he booklet, since almost all agriculture in the US is petro intensive, increases in petroleum prices are mirrored in food prices, and in many cases amplified. For example, this years 60% increase in oil will likely end up leading to an increase in food prices next year of 80-100% since the higher fuel prices will drive many small farmers under, supply will go down as production costs increase. Add in all the downstream costs (from the farm) such as transprotation, processing, packaging, etc... including the fact that profit margin is generally calculated as a percentage of total cost as opposed to a static number, and it quickly becomes apparent that food prices are certainly set to skyrocket if energy costs do not come down.\n \n Anyway, back to the booklet, there was actually a section in there about PLOW TEAMS. Yes, that is right, horses pulling a plow. Do you city folks have any idea how hungry you are going to get if energy costs ever actually did reach the point where it is more financially feasible to hitch up a plow team than to buy gas for a tractor? Screwed is putting it lightly.\n \n Maybe the time will come when it will be not only more economically feasible, but more practical as well, to invest in transportation sources that run off of hay and pull a buggy. I, for one, hope not. At $7-$10 per gallon, though, shetlands, which were originally bred to be in town buggy horses, might make a comeback. They only have an average speed of about 25 miles per hour, but you can buy a LOT of hay for the $200 it would cost to fill up at that point.",

For years people who suggested that maybe basing our ENTIRE economy on a non renewable resources was not such a hot idea were treated as virtual lunatics. Even just 6 months or a year ago, on this very board, suggestions that world oil supply was soon to peak were met with disdain and accusations of fear mongering were immediately let loose. \n \n It seems to be a different world today, now that the Bush administration has referenced the upcoming catastrophe more than once (including Chaney, who just 18 moths ago called the very idea preposterous). As we examine alternatives, it becomes quickly obvious that there are simply none that can replace oil, which puts us neck deep in a pile of brown smelly stuff.\n \n Suddenly, as the alternatives are examined, such as planting the entire states of Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Iowa, south Dakota, and Missouri in corn, and dedicating the states of Nevada and Arizona to huge distilleries, which is what it would take to replace JUST the oil we use for transportation with ethanol, they don't seem like such hot ideas or even practical ideas. \n \n People seem to be starting to grasp exactly how entrenched petro products are in our lives. From the food we eat, to the plastic cups we drink out of, to the toothbrush in our holder, to the toothpaste we put on that brush. All are petro based. Even the availability of raw materials (metals, etc...) is petro based, since it takes huge amounts of energy to mine those materials and refine them, and that energy comes primarily from oil.",

Maybe something on the order of occupying all the ME, making it a Christian democracy while we use their oil for their own good? With every family owning their own home, two cars and a boat. Wait, they've used that promise and it failed. Not to worry, I'm sure they'll come up with something that'll keep the sheep headed towards the cliff.\n\n \n No, George, they are already using that one. Haven't you heard.....the governemtn is going to spearhead the development of cars that run on water, thus saving the world. COME ON. Any reasonable person should have looked at the \"cars that run on water\" and gone \"yea, right, and I have a perpetual energy machine in my butt I will sell you cheap\". \n \n They put some really impressive Buck Rodgers sounding scientific mumbo jumbo with it, and people lapped it up. Sure, you can make a car run off of water.....and 75 KWH of electricity. At this point, it is more sensible to skip the water all together and just drag an extension cord behind you everywhere you go.

I went to the topeka gun and knife show not long ago.

At those prices, there are really only 3 questions:\n \n 1: How much do you have?\n 2: Do you have a dolly?\n 3: Wouldn't it just be easier if you followed me home in your truck so I can unload it with a forklift?\n \n I have shot several hundred rounds of the stuff I bought from him, and have yet to see a misfire (I target shoot incessantly).

   "If we can get renewables working properly for electricity generation, thne I think the solution may become local power generation with attached hydrogen production. If every street has a wind turbine, then electricity generated can be used for power and for separating water into hydrogen and oxygen, the heat lost during the separation can be used to heat water for domestic use (I'm assuming most of the energy loss is heat). This way you get hydrogen fuel, and domestic energy requirements covered. You'd still need the energy grid to shift power around, but if there are enough turbines there would be sufficient redundancy to cover all the energy needs. Offshore turbines could cover the gap left by high density populations. It's already been established than wind turbines off the Norfolk coast could power the whole of the UK.\n \n As for bio-diesel, vegetable oil mixed with about 5% kerosene works for this, I'm told, a lot of German cars will run off this straight off.

I think you are confusing the fuel cell itself with methods of producing hydrogen.\n \n Just the fuel cells are problematic, as outlined above. Creating hydrogen is a whole different ballgame.

In nuclear power, they use uranium. Uranium comes ouf of mines. Mining machines run on petro products.

   ". Over an entire continent, between solar, wind, wave and tidal generation there is enough room for redundancy to maintain the supply. Sure it will be challenging to coordinate, but the relatively simply nature of generation means the plants can be more or less switched on and off at will, unlike large conventiional stations which tend to be all or nothing. Wind isn't the answer on its own, but it can make huge dents in reliance on fossil fuels.\n\n \n Electricity generated by transforming solar, wind, or wave energy cannot be controlled \"at will\". Sure, you can switch the generators off any time its convenient; but you obviously cannot switch them on when the energy that drives them is unavailable. A generator driven by wind is useless in calm weather; solar power at night ? Wave power is unreliable and difficult to harness in substantial measures.\n \n The alternative you haven't mentioned which is probably the best long term option for the supply of electricity, is nuclear power.",

   "I'm talking about all sources aggregate over a continent, and further if necessary. I don't have figures but I can't see it being beyond the realms of possibility to coordinate across Europe, and possibly into Africa and Asia as well, power generation across many timezones, so that solar power from the sahara would be backed up by wind power in northern europe. The key point is redundancy, probably aiming for capacity at twice or 3 times usage. If this alone does not cover needs all the time then at peak power production excess power could be used to extract hydrogen and use it to build reserves to produce power in a number of areas to supplement shortfalls and to provide localised strategic reserves in the event of damage or failure of parts of the grid. It would require huge logistical investment to set up and maintain, but it is ultimately the only sustainable method. Nuclear is vastly expensive, dangerous, and produces waste that is difficult to deal with and presents massive security risks.\n \n Just out of curiosity, I'm not an engineer so I don't really know about this, but what prevents hydrogen being used in a modified internal combustion engine? Is it just a question of pressures and risk of catastrophic explosion?",

If you put 100,000 volts at 1000 amps into a high tension line and transmit it 300 miles, you only have 100,000 volts at 600 amps at the other end. That is still a sginificant loss. Less than you woudl get from DC, sure, but still enough to make a worldwide grid prohibitive. Add in teh 10% (conservatively) transformer loss, and consider the fact that you are looking at 4 transformer \"drops\" before it actually hits your back wall, and the problem with such a scheme should be apparent.\n \n Sure, you are still getting a lot fo power at the recieving end, but line loss makes it horribly inefficient. Sure you CAN do it, but oe must keep in mind that the loss of a single amp in transmission is the loss of an entire order of magnitude at the other end (1.e instead of 220v x 10 amps, you end up with 220 vx9 amps). \n \n You also ghave to consider the ENORMOUS expense of interconnecting all those little grids in between, not to mention the installation of new mains across hundreds of miles of deserted countryside, including maintenance of thsoe mains, and the fact that you must have redundant delivery capability less a sotrm on africa knock out power to all of britain.",

   "Such as? The problem with most renewable energy schemes is that they are dependant on either low mass feedstocks, or they are dependant on waste stream utilization, and that waste stream is generally dependant on cheap energy to begin with. \n\n \n Okey... I don`t really know what all that meant ;). As for your question, I would say Norway with its massive hydro-power system (currently satisfies 99,3% of Norways electricity demand), or Iceland, with it`s massive geo-thermal \"deposits\". I`m sure there are plenty of other countries that could do rather well for themselves in this field.\n \n \n \nFuel cells are a way to produce electricity, using hydrogen as a fuel Theoretically, we may someday get to the point where fuel cells are effective. There is no such thing as reaching a point where hydorgen production is efficient or effective. You need electricity to produce hydrogen, and you need a fuel source to create that electricity. In nuclear power, they use uranium. Uranium comes ouf of mines. Mining machines run on petro products. If you build more nuclear powerplants, you need more uranium, which means more minse, which means more energy mining. So, the price of uranium goes up, and as a result, the price of power, and the hydrogen produced by that power. \n\n \n But if fuel-cells are able to store electricity for future use, wouldn`t that imply that you don`t need to run the mining machines on petro, but rather could use fuel-cells for that purpose?\n \n \nThen, the hydrogen has to be compressed and stored and transported. With hydrogen, this is difficult, since it will permeate nearly every material known to man. So all your pumps, tanks, lines, etc.. have to be specially built. No off the shelf stuff at all.\n\n \n Long term perspective ;)\n \n \nCurrent estimates show that in order to replace just half of the gasoline used int he US each year (current consumption), we would need to build 10 new nuclear plants dedicated soley to the production of electricty for hydrogen production. \n \n Nobody has that kind of excess generation capacity, and the costs inherent to that kind of generation puts the theoretical cost of the hydrogen produced at roughly 14x the cost per energy unit from petro.\n\n \n Yes but that is based on current (recent) prices for oil as well as current prices for hydrogen production. I`m talking about the long-run. Oil isn`t going to run out over-night (and when it starts to run out, prices will increase, making the hydrogen looking like a better deal)\n \n Edit: updated hydro-power figures",
