   "I place this matter here in \"civil rights\" because it denies or curtails participation in society by ordinary citizens.\n \n Background checks, in particular, criminal background checks for employment have become quite prevalent. We should ask, are they truely justified and are they reasonable? If so, when. What are the costs to society and individuals as a result? What about the costs of (a) lost or delaid productivity while waiting for hiring approval (b) lost or delaid wages putting families is financial jeapardy (c) maintaining financial support or subsidy through food stamps or the like, and (d) lost taxible revenue? \n \n Checking for current warrents and other conditions within the past 6 months may be reasonable. Checking further back in time becomes exponentialy less so, the further back one goes. What should be relavent is what the person may have done within the past five years, not some time in the distant past. I suspect through these proceedures are driven more by bean counter fear of litigation and the chance of someone finding out something about someone should that person cause a problem than anything else. It seems the real soluting and sensible thing would be to put a lid on the first and close the loop holes for the second.\n \n From what I have seen, background checks can take an exceedingly long time, which is totally out of line. If I can have approval to buy and gun within ten to 15 minutes, which is as it should be, one ought to be approved for employment in the same range of time. Anything more than 24 hrs seems to be a case of gross incompitance and neglect.\n \n Lets remember, background checks hurt families, they hurt children (I know) in their delays and their unreasonable denials. They are not completely and good thing and need to be infused with reason and common sense.\n \n Regards\n John M",

   "yeah, but at the same time criminals hurt families and children too. and criminals with a history of behavior have been known to repeat it even after being convicted and serving time. yes, many reform and make a much better life for themselves in spite of their past. but to remove background checks would be a risk to the business/employer as well as the community. if the effect of background checks is so strong for people that actually do care about their future and families, then i see the existence of background checks as a deterent factor to crimes, rather than a bad thing.\n \n you also have to remember, a criminal is not entitled to all the rights of an innocent civillian, and by their own choice and subsequent actions, they waive those rights. nobody takes it away from them, they effectively give them up. i believe that people have a right to know that they are dealing with a convicted felon and use the appropriate measures of caution.",

   "I think the answer to this is to make criminal record non-public. If you commit a crime and are punished for it, that should be the end of it. That is the entire point of our criminal justice system. Allowing employers access to these records so they can use them to make employment decisoins is, IMNSHO, just punishing a person twice for the same crime. \n \n People make mistakes. We are effectively allowing them to be punished for the rest of their lives for those mistakes. A crimanla who gets out of prison and wishes to go straight may or may not be able to pull it off. Sith the prevelance of criminal background checks in corporate america today, the odds of him getting anything close to a decent job at a decent wage are pretty slim. \n \n If that person has a family to support, they soon end up in a situatuon where their back is against the wall. People whose families are hungry and at risk of ending up living on the street are generally no opposed to commiting a crime to provide for them. We are seeing a lot more \"need absed\" crime in repeat offenders (i.e people stealing in order to feed themselves or their families). I think this is a direct result of the fact that criminal background checks have become cheap and easy for employers to run.",

   "daewoo, I have to partially disagree with you, it should depend on what the job you are going for, and what offence you were convicted of. I would not want a child molester working at a day care facility, nor an embezzler working as my account. If the records were sealed, there would be no way to know.",

   "While I wholly agree that you would not want a child molester working in a day care, or an embezzeler doing your accounting, I don't see any way to allow for background checks in certasin occupations while preventing them in others. \n \n For years, background checks were extremely difficult to do because we didn't have computers or connectivity in our law enfocement and court system. If you wanted to know about a persons background, you had to literlly pick up th phone and contact every jurisdiction that person had lived in. \n \n Business still survived (some would even say \"thrived\") not knowing that the guy who is working in their shop, or even one of their managers once stole a car when he was 18 and went joy riding. \n \n I think this is one of the reasons that our system was set up the way it was, as a series of partially interconnected jurisdictions. If you made a mistake and commited a crime, once you had done your punishment you were free to move to another part of the country where nobody had ever heard of you and get a fresh start at life. there is no such thing as a fresh start anymore. Everything is \"wired\". If you commited a crime 10 years ago in tennesee, there is nothing to stop a potential employer in kansas from finding out by running a 3 minute background check.\n \n I don't think that is appropriate. You do the crime, you do the time, but I don't think that allowing a person to be punished for the rest of their lives is right. \n \n Prior to the easy availabiltiy of background checks, employers contacted previous employers to get information about a persons work habits, etc... This was sufficient then, and still should be. Some employers didn't bother (the constuction industry is a good example, as well as many factory jobs). You could work in one of these uindustries for a few years, build your dredentials, then move on.\n \n I think tat the child molester in the day care is likely a bigger threat than the embezzeler in the financial firm scenario, since a check of proir employers should turn up the embezzelment issue. As far as the child molester goes, maybe registration for sex offenders is not a bad idea. We know that most sex offenders are mentally ill, and we know that they generally will repeat their offense. \n \n Of course, registration SHOULD be unneeded, since parents should have taught their children about dealing with strangers, and should be supervising their activities.",

We had decided on one, the first week, not a day went by that something happened that I felt weird about..So we pulled him out. Found a new one and I could not be happier. The director was telling me a story about one of the teachers there, just recently got fired because she got a call from the FBI and they had to pull his finger prints.. He was arrested in a bar, for a fight... Mind you this guy had devoted his life to children, had his degree in early child-care development... Now he cannot ever work with kids again.\n Now I am thankful for them being so cautious but at the same time... everyone has been in some kind of situation in their lives where it might not go as you planned. In his case, stupid bar fight.. who really knows what happened. sad for him to lose his career that way. His kids still go to the school but he no longer works there. So I think its a double edged sword, but also needed. There are a lot of creeps out there and you never really know someone. I am sure there is an exception to the rule every once in awhile, but its a small price to pay for the big picture.",

   "Background checks are excessive and abusive and is yet another violation of the right to privacy.\n \n I'm buying a house and I have to give my SSN to the water company and the light company...huh????\n \n Even if I was a criminal, are they going to deny me water and electric? Even if I had bad credit, are they going to deny me water and electric? Such abuses! The more people who have my SSN the more chances of identity theft. But they don't care, its not them, its me!\n \n As for criminals, its a violation of thier rights when others do background checks. Sure, background checks may save a lot of grief in the long run, but maybe just freaking maybe these criminals never should have been let out in the first place. Criminals who are let out legally have paid back their debt to society. We all are equal at that point. They must not be branded for eternity, if WE let them out, its a new beginning for them. If we think these criminals are still a criminal element, why in the heck did we let them out? :xcensored \n \n God the stupidity.",
