   "Hello.\n \n I have lived the first thirty years of my life in a suburb of Paris where most people come from, or have parents coming from the Maghreb. Islam is the main religion of those who practice. My first girlfriend had algerian and french parents. She never had any trouble with religion, she never seemed to practice any. Later when I was already a young man I mated with a girl whose parents were algerian/morrocan. Islam were supposed to be practiiced at their home but there were mainly a racism problem. Lots of reasons could be invoked to explain this however classic situation. Later she met another \"white\" man, and eventually stopped with Islam, as viewed by her parents. There we had a little confusion between personal experiences (leading to being a jerk), tradition and religion.\n \n During those thirty years of being raised in this neighbourhood, I don't think I saw more than a couple of what we call burqa. Women sometimes wear some kind of veils, by the way that's how we generally call this bit of tissue. There is the famous debate: must the veil be really banned from school? Sometimes to entertain us and make us forget more important topics the media get into this again.\n \n France has for a time colonized a large part of Africa, as you know for sure. Therefore France and the countries of this area have a special relationship, a little bit like the one England can have with India. Colonialism is officially over but links are strong, for different reasons. Migrant waves have been observed, mainly for work of course. We often talk about \"integration\" but we also have to deal with different cultures. I do think all cultures can bring good ingredients in the soup we are cooking. I think a society cannot be still. Unfortunately there is not only good ingredients.\n \n The burqa, according to the wikipedia article, is a derived form of the Afghan tchadri, and is about two decades old. I don't think it's a really religious object since it is so young. Actually, even if the classic veil that I'm already used to see is used originally for religious reasons, the reason I've been given ( from the mouth of muslim women of various ages) is that it's a tradition, and not a religious law. Actually it's often a matter of interpretation of the texts, and what one consider to be motivated by religion or not. \n \n I personnally find the burqa (the real one that covers the whole body) is an insult to women's dignity. Not because it is worn by muslim people but because its obvious intent is to hide the woman away from anybody's eyes. If jews, buddhist, or any other believer wore such a thing, I would say the same thing. I'd also add that women wearing burqa in France represent an infinitesimal percentage of the population. So I guess there is no real debate.",

Because it's not that simple.\n \n When you are born and grow up in a family where things are done one way, it's sometimes very hard to realize they can be done another way. I mean that even when women in France or in the States can have the benefit of some laws such as the first amendment, they still live in a family where rules are straight, and most of all, they have been taught that these rules were the norm, no matter what Sarkozy or Obama say on TV. \n \n I met someone one day who wouldn't sleep on the ground when it didn't bother me at all, because I had to do it before and had no problem with it. That person couldn't accept the simple idea of sleeping elsewhere than in a bed. There is no law against sleeping on the ground. That's the problem with some muslim women and more generally some people: they're used to a straight system and cannot even imagine another one.\n \n So when women say they wear burqa because they decided to, it's most of the time true, but they rarely ask themselves some questions about WHY they \"decided\" this. Sometimes we think we have a choicewhen we don't really have any, because of a mind and/or religious setup.",

   "How does smoking pot and wearing a piece of cloth compare to each other? \n\n \n Both are religious expressions, yet we ban one and not the other.\n \n\n I wouldn't know however I see many Muslim women here in California wear it as a matter of choice or religious preference. Like I stated earlier if it is a means of repression that's one thing if it is free religious expression that is another.\n \n\n The problem is that if we allow it \"by choice\", there is no choice. Muslim women in strict Muslim families will be forced by their family to comply. That's NOT choice. \n \n\n I did.\n \n And...... So what? Goal? I feel that they are westernizing hopefully... I think your bridging the gap between radical Islam and those who practice their faith all over a cloth. There is a fine line but don't be like one particular forum member who calls for the murder of all women and children related to a radical.....\n \n\n Their stated goal isn't to assimilate into Western society, they want to transform it into Sharia states. My example of Dearborn is just to show that there's no attempt to assimilate, the goal is to transform. The same is being seen in France and several other European countries.\n \n\n But I know what is the difference between oppression and simple expression of faith JP.

   "They can practice their religion, they just can&#8217;t wear burquas. I find it amazing that everyone thinks that the First Amendment gives anyone carte blanche permission to do anything they like in the name of religion. It doesn&#8217;t. Rastafarians can&#8217;t run around smoking pot in public; Yaqui Indians can&#8217;t run around tripping on peyote buttons. In fact, school children in some schools can&#8217;t even wear crosses in school. \n \n Since you obviously have no experience with Muslim women, you&#8217;re clueless. That&#8217;s understandable. Look what happened with the Shah of Iran westernized Iran prior to 1979. Iranian women didn&#8217;t wear burquas, could attend school and were treated more like equals. Since the 1979 revolution, repression of women has been re-established. Do you think the women chose to go back to wearing burquas on their own?\n \n See above. \n \n Look at the goal of Muslims that immigrate into any area in high numbers. They attempt to change the community into a Muslim state. France is a great example of that metamorphosis. Near me in Dearborn, they blast their call to prayers over loud speakers throughout the city. XXX?!!\n \n Like I stated above, you have no experience with Muslim women, so you have no knowledge of the repression. \n \n Radical Islam should not be tolerated in the West. We have no responsibility to protect those hellbent on destroying our way of life from within.\n\n \n \n Unexpectedly, I agee with much of what you say, except that I don't see the muslim community, which is made of simple people, as a propaganda group. I mean, I never met any muslim trying to turn me into another one. Oh yeah, there is that crazy colleague of mine, she was a catholic, then she was a jewish, and now she's a muslim. When I first arrived she couldn't let me go, maybe she thought I would be a good believer!\n \n Seriously, there is no threat of losing the best aspects of french society. No one, in any city that I know in my country has ever had to endure the loudspeakers calling for prayer. By the way it seems that the US can go to the extreme in bad or good, when France is always a field of compromise (with good and bad results).\n \n I now live in a suburb that looks a bit like the one I grew up in, lots of hallal butcheries, oriental wearing shops, etc... but not only. People are normal. The only neighbours who speak to me are \"arabs\". I used te iverted comas because I don't know where they're from and I don't give a cotton-pickin beeeeeeep.\n \n Now, you will find men beating their wives (just like in the old time when there wasn't one muslim around), chaining them to the kitchen or teaching their children that woman have to wear a veil, a niqab, a burqa or whatever they like to see on them. I have seen people really spaced out, so far from the french do's and dont's, but overall, it's still a country where Christmas and new year's eve are the climax of the year in terms of filling your stomach, still a country where beer is a sureshot sale at any street corner (even where I live).

   "The jihad watch link, extract:\n \n \n\"Youths\" from \"poor, immigrant-heavy suburbs.\" It all started over the deaths of two teens. You would never know it from this news report, but this is an initiative of Muslim youths, mobilized against the French authorities by the accidental deaths of two young Muslims who were in the act of fleeing from the police. This is all part of the simmering contempt and hatred young Muslims in France and all over Europe have for Infidel society -- jahiliyyah. \"Hundreds arrested in French violence,\" from CBC News\n\n \n Taking CBC News for a source is some sort of sign that can help validate the theory depicting this site as Islamophobic.\n \n This is the paragraph that deals with this aspect of the site on Wikipedia:\n \n \nCriticism\n \n The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called Jihad Watch an \"Internet hate site\" and claimed it is \"notorious for its depiction of Islam as an inherently violent faith that is a threat to world peace.\"Guardian writer Brian Whitaker described Jihad Watch as a \"notoriously Islamophobic website\", while other critics such as Dinesh D'Souza, Karen Armstrong and Cathy Young, pointed to what they see as \"deliberate mischaracterizations\" of Islam and Muslims by Spencer as inherently violent and therefore prone to terrorism. Various attempts to block the site based on allegations of \"hate speech\" have been mostly unsuccessful.\n \n Former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, in her book Reconciliation: Islam, Democracy, and the West, wrote that Spencer uses Jihad Watch to spread misinformation and hatred of Islam. She added that he presents a skewed, one-sided, and inflammatory story that only helps to sow the seed of civilizational conflict.\n\n \n As for what I know about those riots that took place in the suburbs: as you may already know, I grew up in a project. Most of my neighbours were from algerian, morrocan families. There also were some bits of tunisia, and black african countries like mali, senegal, cameroon. Even armenia and what was then yougoslavia. But to make it short, most of the families were of muslim confession, wether they were fervent of just respecting traditions of the family. You can take my word, I never had any problem of any sort with that, not once. My best friend was a muslim, my first girlfriend was from a muslim family. I didn't give a damn about it and I still don't, because the people I lived with didn't have any religious revendication and never stopped me from living the way my parents taught me. You will always find differences between people, and there were some, but it never stopped respectful people to live a normal life. And that's what I did in my project. I never deny that there are difficulties, violence and such, but these are linked with poverty. I didn't suffer more violence than the average french people.\n \n What's funny about the way the information is treated on CBC and on jihad watch is that it's focused on the fact that the two boys who were killed were muslims. Here in france we did hear that they were from migrant families, raising again the racism issue, but people did not talk about religion. These were just two little thugs, at worst. It's incredible to read: \"This is all part of the simmering contempt and hatred young Muslims in France and all over Europe have for Infidel society\" !!! What the hell are they talking about? Here we don't say \"young muslims\", we say \"young people\". Writing or saying \"young muslims\" is a way of drawing a topic following a certain angle, that is the islamophobic one. Two thugs fleeing from the police are not two muslim fundamentalists. \n \n I understand you have an experience of muslim people, and maybe you feel they don't respect your way of life. The people who disrespected me were of all kinds of confessions, and very often didn't believe in any god. \n \n Now, the riots took place in suburbs where, as in my former and current living places, many muslims live. But they are not the only people living there and producing offspring. I am \"white\", with no religion. Every evening when I get back home I see all kinds of people, and among them the usual scary ones with hoods, strange behaviours, crackheads, people from around 15 to their thirties you don't want to mess with. You know the deal. Well, this group of scary people is not entirely made of muslims. The same can be said about the riots. These were not \"muslim riots\", as suggested. Actually, the very concept would be absurd from my point of view, which was placed in the heart of the subject. Even \"arab riots\" would be million miles away of what happened, because it was not about ethnies fighting each other but about what is going on in france. Poverty, unemployment , ghetto-ization tendancy, etc. If I had been a little lesss lucky, I may have found myself in the rioting crowd, though I'm more of a non-violent nature.\n \n Thanks for reading. I'll take a close look at the other links.",

   "The ynetnews link:\n \n Once again, quite biased choice since ynet is an israeli site, but I didn't find any major flaw in the article, that carried true information. I even like to quote one excerpt:\n \n \nAnti-Semitic and anti-Muslim incidents in France have risen in the past when Mideast tensions mounted significantly. In 2002, some 2,300 Jews left France for Israel because they felt unsafe. Incidents of Islamophobia also have been reported. \n\n \n Example of those incidents in france:\n \n France24 - Arson attack damages Lyon mosque\n \n And in the West Bank context:\n \n BBC News - Rabbis condemn attack on West Bank mosque \n \n So, yes, we already knew there were barbaric acts and we have too frequent reports concerning these acts, wether they are done by muslims, jews, or whatever.\n \n \n \n PS - in addition to my first post concerning the suburban riots; it's another way of expressing what I feel about this issue, though I don't agree at all with the first part of the first sentence, of course:\n \n \nThe 2005 French riots serve as an illustration of the problems of integrating Muslims in France, and smaller scale riots have been occurring throughout the 1980s and 1990s, first in Vaulx-en-Velin in 1979, and in V\u00e9nissieux in 1981, 1983, 1990 and 1999. Furthermore, although Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy claimed that most rioters were immigrants and already known to the police, the majority were, in fact, previously unknown to the police[citation needed]. French suburbians allegedly constantly complain about the stigmatisation of their revolt, falsely over-simplified as a so-called \"Muslim riot\". French actor Roschdy Zem said in an interview with the French magazine Premi\u00e8re given during the promotion of the movie Indig\u00e8nes about those riots:\n \n \"Making of those riots an ethnico-religious affair seemed to me particularly disgusting. When railwaymen are blocking France, nobody goes search further as their demands. Take any Norwegian or Swede, inflict the same life conditions [as those of some French banlieusards] on them and I can assure you that they will end up burning cars too..\n\n \n Taken from the wikipedia page on islam in france.",

   "The frontpage magazine link:\n \n The page appears broken.\n \n Anyway, I see that this site, like jihad watch, stems from the David Horowitz Freedom Center. I've read the wiki biography of D. Horowitz. What is interesting is his evolution from left to right wing of course. It seems he's against racism and for gay rights (except gay marriage), which is good, particularly for a conservative. I also think affirmative action is, in a certain way, racist.\n \n However he seems to be feeding a certain parano\u00efa with the confusion created about some topics treated in these sites, the kind of confusion I commented on the \"paris\" riots topic. \n \n \n The parapundit link:\n \n \n Muslim Immigrants Riot To Remind French Of Bad Immigration Policy \n\n \n I repeat: this was not a \"muslim immigrant riot\". There has never been such thing here. Among the rioters, mostly young people, white, black, brown, etc, french young people from diverse familial backgrounds, maghreb and \"traditional\" french, and others. \n \n \nthe current rate of destruction of property by hostile Arab and African Muslims in France is already pretty high\n\n \n This is ignorant and dangerous. \"Hostile Arab and African Muslims\" ? Like they say, XXX? \n \n The newspapers, TV and such sites have this well known tendancy of twisting information to sometimes more than an absurd extent.\n \n Sometimes you can tell when you obviously know better than what is said or shown in the media. \n \n An illustration of this: http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/200907270040\n \n I even remember some hilarious france map on a us TV program, making Madrid a french city. These little things count and are a testimony of how little attention journalists sometimes give to what has to be accurate. If they don't even present this kind of thing properly, how are we supposed to believe the content of a report, for instance, the ethnic and religious aspect of a riot?",

   "The canada.com link:\n \n This article starts with the ever stupid clich\u00e9 \"arab african ghetto\"... but I found something interesting:\n \n \nBy shining light into France's shadows, Chirac sends to Arab and African youth -- and to Old French -- a powerful message of equal dignity. Eclipsing a divisive historical memory, he proposes truth and reconciliation. Such a reframed \"integration\" debate may help gain time for hard reforms to bite.\n \n Mere words? Perhaps. But wasn't it words like \"clean out the scum\" -- uttered by Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy -- that helped set fire to almost 10,000 cars in three weeks?\n\n \n In french, it was: \"<< Vous en avez assez, hein, vous avez assez de cette bande de racailles ? Eh bien on va vous en d\u00e9barrasser >> It can be translated into: \"You've had enough, uh? You've had enough of this bunch of xxxx? Well we'll get rid of them for you.\"\n \n Then there was the Karcher sentence. Something about \"cleaning the projects\". \n \n \nFrench politician Nicolas Sarkozy once declared that La Courneuve, a banlieue outside of Paris where a boy was killed by a stray gunshot, would be \"cleaned out with a K\u00e4rcher\" (nettoyer la cit\u00e9 au K\u00e4rcher) - meaning all criminals and other undesirables should be removed and washed out. This comment was highly controversial, as many French associate the banlieues with immigrants, especially North Africans.\n\n \n K\u00e4rcher - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n I'm sorry to insist on that point, but I'm what some people might consider of old-french ascendance. Though... my family is from Reunion Island. I'm just \"white\", so people tend to think I'm rooted in the continent. If Reunion Island were to get its independance, maybe I would be considered the way all the people coming from algeria are. But I'm digressing.\n \n Now, the bold letters in the last quote are clearly a sign of what people do when they don't really know: they figure, they picture things. I understand this, because as I said before, I can have misconceptions about other civilizations, countries. The same principle works here, in my own country; some people don't really know how life is, who the people are, what is going on in other parts of the country. So they fantasize easily. Tv doesn't help. Again: there is not only north african immigrants in the suburbs, but also people like me. Maybe I'm a good guy, who knows. But I can tell you I had to deal with \"white\"people who had not too gentle manners. Hence, there were also\"white\" rioters. Ok, I know, I'm redundant again.\n \n Gotta go, I will edit all this later.\n \n See you.",

   "The sunday times link:\n \n A quite ordinary article. A man is said to have commited suicide, people tend to believe police officers have more likely killed him. As usual in this case, killing of an arab by some police officers in these particular circumstances can be considered as a racist act, hence the riots, because this happened already. \n \n \n A well-known example of police getting things out of control is the Rodney King video, and the riots that followed, a simple cause-effect chain. \n \n YouTube - Rodney King\n \n The man in Firminy may not have been beaten to death, but he was found hung. Any scenario can be imagined.

At least, it doesn't stress any so-called ethnic or religious aspect of the riots, since it's focused on cars.\n \n \n And to be more directly on topic, one more wiki bit:\n \n \nThe wearing of the burqa in public places is prohibited, but it remains a rare phenomenon. A note of Sub-Directorate General of Information Department of the Interior revealed by Le Monde in July 2009, listed a count of 367 women wearing the garment in France. Le Figaro evokes in September 2009 a confidential report of the sub-directorate of general information written in the summer of 2009 that would have assessed their number to less than 2000 from information on places of worship Salafists. Other forms of veils seem to be used. The controversy lies instead on the simple headscarf, which suffered restrictions in schools, in particular, where a law was enacted.\n\n \n Translated from Burqa - Wikip\u00e9dia\n \n Figures are quite weak.We're about 65,4 millions in this country. At \"worst\", 2000 women wearing the garment.So this really is a drop in the ocean. I don't mean that it doesn't have to be debated or watched but it's not a real problem as it is now. \n \n The media gives us things to be afraid of. Lately it's been the roms, and again the terrorist attack threat. Tomorrow it will be something else. Unsafety is what works the best. It's one of the best tools to get elected. These fears are tools to divide us a little more each time they bring them out of the box; it's the same old technique: divide and conquer.",

It's hard for me to imagine anyone caring so little about public safety as to put their selfish reasons first.\n\n \n Is the Burka banned in the US?",

   "Is the Burka banned in the US?\n\n No, but unfortunately we have so many idiotic laws (I am sure everywhere else is in the same bind) that if a police officer really wants to hit you with something they can find some excuse. A law of the type mentioned which were obviously designed to target criminals hiding their identity before or after a crime could be construed to make the burqa a prosecutable offense. It is against the spirit of the law, but any law that is open to interpretation is a bad law, that is why I don't like this constitution worship you see sometimes. Oh yes, we need to think about the spirit of the constitution; spirit this; original intentions that; principles behind it there. No, what it says is what it says; if you can even argue over it in a serious manner it wasn't explicit enough. English hasn't changed so greatly, there simply were things said that shouldn't have been and things omitted that shouldn't have been.\n \n I have seen many head dresses in maryland but no real burqas. I think we must also remember that public law is not the same as private law or public privilege.\n \n For instance there is no speed limit or driving laws unless you are driving on a public road. Those are just conditions with which the privilege of the road goes with.\n \n The Burqa Incident This is an interesting story on private security people's actions, I think some security people must be grown up versions of school yard bullies with paranoia thrown into the mix.\n \n Anyway the final answer is no not really but with the provision that some people including police and security could get annoyed at you and find some excuse. For instance I bet I could wear a toga without it being illegal by any stretch but if someone complained to the police, or a security guard didn't like it I would still get thrown out or be given a stern talking to even if they wouldn't arrest me.",
