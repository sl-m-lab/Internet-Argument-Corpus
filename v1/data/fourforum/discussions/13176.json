I was not there, so I can only go by what was reported by the media. And yes, I will agree that the hyperbole seen on Fox News is often times given a rightward slant, just as MSNBC leans to the left. I take many reports from these 2 outlets very lightly. \n\n Let's examine those two words individually...\n 1) \"Attempting\"\n To me, to proclaim somebody \"attempted\" to do something you have to show some sort of good reason to assess it as an \"attempt\".\n If I say somebody \"attempted\" to block my entrance into a building, I want to know what they actually did. Did they stand in front of the door and refuse to move?\n The article talks about \"closing ranks\", which is a ridiculously vague term. They could have \"closed ranks\" to the side of the door.\n I don't know, but when it comes to things like this I notice when they miss saying something obvious and just imply it.\n The guy doesn't say that they \"moved out of the way\", so it leaves me to wonder if they closed ranks for the purposes of leaving no gap to the door, how did he get in?\n It sounds to me like he had a way to get in despite their positioning. I believe their move was to intimidate more than to physically obstruct. To give a semblance of potential violence, when all they were going to do is position themselves and claim \"free speech\" in order to obfuscate.\n \n 2) \"alleged\"...\n I find it interesting that just this guy \"alleges\" this.\n Using language that leaves some things that might be assumed, but unstated.\n I understand he alleges it.\n But at the same time it is up to a judge to address the substance of his allegation, and as such one could \"allege\" that the judge rejected his allegation.\n \n Again, to be perfectly clear, I really wish those charges had not been dropped. I wish this black panther had been convicted.\n My consistency is against intimidation of brandishing weapons.\n \n Your consistency is drawn in a different way, and I understand your position while I disagree with it.\n \n \n \nI only provided the example because I had mentioned the other videos. Iagree it is a bit off topic, but yet it is all symptomatic of a bigger problem...that of people playing politics at a place that should be sanitized of any political agendas and bias.\n\n Gotcha.\n And I do appreciate the video. It was incredibly disturbing and am deeply frustrated that little / nothing ever comes from general things of this nature.\n \n \n \nYou must first believe that his sign was calling for the blood of Obama. I think that is a lttle bit of a stretch. I don't believe the words Obama or blood were on the man's sign.\n\n The man's sign said: \"It Is Time To Water The Tree Of Liberty.\" \n That is referencing a line written by Thomas Jefferson: \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\" \n \n THAT is what he was saying the \"Tree of Liberty\" should be watered with.\n Surely we can agree he wasn't thinking it was time for a garden hose to be used?\n \n Which leaves the question of which \"tyrant\" was he looking for the blood of?\n Well gee. WHERE did he go?\n To Obama's town hall area...\n \n I sincerely fail to see ANY other real interpretation.\n What do you think he was saying?\n \n \n \nI see the major difference as how the weapon was displayed, just as the law does as well. The black panther wrongfully claimed to be \"security\" which he clearly was not, and he was holding the weapon and according to some \"tapping it menacingly\" while making comments about \"being tired of you white supremacists\".\n\n First of all, statements are supposedly free speech.\n Secondly, I could argue it is just as much of a stretch from going from \"tired of you white supremacists\" to advocating violence...\n Quite frankly, on the \"free speech\" line, his statements alone mean nothing.\n \n As for the weapon, I understand your position but the \"menacingly\" line is obviously up for interpretation.\n I personally believe it to be accurate, but for people who are willing to give more latitude towards the \"tree of liberty\" gun-toter there should be consistency.\n \n Regardless, I agree that \"tapping\" the nightstick is a serious issue.\n \n \n \nI would agree that had the man had a sign ssaying kill Obama, or had been holding the gun, then yes..toss the cuffs on him and take him away. I do not however find a man wearing a gun on his hip an intimidating gesture, and probably never will. This is simply where we part company on the issue. I grew up around guns, and am proud to be a responsible gun owner and \"toter\" as well. It seems as though PA law agrees with me (as I am sure other states are certain to as well) that a holstered gun cannot in the eyes of the law as a threat.\n\n I have heard different people try to make up reasons as to why he supposedly had a gun there.\n Like he was supposedly protecting himself, which is absurd at face value.\n The guy only created more of a threat for himself by carrying the gun there.\n \n The sign is clear.\n I have yet to see anybody give any competing interpretation of that sign.\n The gun? The message is also clear.\n I think he was relaying an empty threat, but a threat nonetheless.\n \n For the black panther situation, do you really think that if the nightstick had been in some holster at his side, but still prominently visible, that people would not have felt intimidated?\n I think they would have.\n And my personal position is that such intimidation has no valid place in America. (note I said valid and not legal. there is a distinction)\n My personal interpretation is that there are wayyy too many people these days who feel that \"intimidation\" is an intelligent method of freedom of speech.\n \n \n \nI have no problem with the black panther standing anywhere exercising his right to free speech. I do have a problem with the him claiming to be \"security\" and holding the night stick in his hand without any sort of provocation. \n\n A lot of what I say is regarding the generic position I get from others.\n And as such, was not truly broaching your position in a lot of ways.\n I understand your consistency, although I would like to explore the \"tree of liberty\" sign further.\n \n But also, I can't help but think of some 60-year old woman who is going to vote, who sees a black panther member at her voting precinct.\n The thought that all he had to do was not say \"security\" and keep his nightstick holstered...\n Scratch that. He could even have replaced the nightstick with a gun and just kept it holstered...\n The message to that 60-year old woman would have been clear.\n \n I understand that there are a lot of people who carry guns WITHOUT the intent to intimidate or threaten.\n But for the guy with the sign? Showing up at the president's town hall?\n The president who has received four times the death threats of the previous president?\n \n Neither that 60-year old woman nor the president should have to put up with such \"intimidation\".\n But again, we come back to a LEGAL line, because the above talks about \"should have to\" and not what should be illegal.\n \n I am reminded of two people who showed up at a Bush event wearing anti-Bush t-shirts. They were arrested.\n Then we have this guy who wore a gun, for a president that supposedly is coming for everybody's guns...\n I seriously hope some people appreciate the irony that THAT guy got to keep his, although I doubt it will impact people's beliefs on the issue of Obama coming for people's guns...\n \n \n \nIf the black panthers are within the law to do so, then I would hope we would do nothing more than keep an eye on them like the police and SS did with the man. You can't go locking people up for exercising their rights. I leave that to trained law enforcement officers on the scene to make a determination of who is posing a threat and who is not posing a threat.\n\n I personally split the issues of \"should he be doing this\" and \"legality\".\n A LOT of what I have been talking about revolves around the simple \"should he be doing this\", invoking a question of whether reasonable people should find such actions repugnant.\n \n Regarding legality, I understand that Americans have some freedoms to act repugnantly. There needs to be some level of freedom to do so, and restricting freedom NEEDS to be based on more than just \"repugnance\".\n I personally think there should be a law controlling firearms within a certain range of the president. Safety issue.\n Like there were laws controlling firearms within a certain range of schoolyards, but the gun lobby got that law stricken down as unconstitutional.\n So it's currently legal for somebody to take a gun to a school area, carrying a sign which could be reasonably interpreted as threatening the kids.\n \n But if that were to happen, you can be that the cops would take care of such a guy, \"escorting\" him out of there...\n And you can bet that there would NOT be a chorus of \"but he's using first / second amendment\" to protest either... emoticon_angry\n \n You can bet that there would be a LOT of similar scenarios where the cops wouldn't put up with this type of crud. Possibly similar to the way that the two people wearing anti-Bush t-shirts were dealt with, without lasting legal repercussions.\n But for Obama? Of course he has to put up with it... \n And the right won't cut him ANY slack in recognizing that he did... emoticon_cool",
