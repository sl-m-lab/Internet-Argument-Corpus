   "WingNutDaily Values Voter Debate\n \n \n What do you intend to do to counteract the homosexual agenda?\n \n \n Alan Keyes: says that he doesn't want the homo agenda to destroy marriage and the natural family. The family ordained by God for procreation must be respected under the law.\n \n Duncan Hunter: We need to support the traditional family...we must fortify the military. [I guess that lame transition from marriage to DADT.]\n \n Ron Paul: It's important have the right to their life if they do no harm. You can't force morals through legislation. A group can't force themselves on any one either, he then goes on to oppose hate crimes legislation of any kind. Boy he dodged the marriage matter all the way.\n \n Sam Brownback: He agrees with Duncan Hunter. He defends Peter Pace's defense of DADT, and making a decision considering his faith. He's proud of standing up for him. DADT is a good policy. He wants to fight against hate crimes law (hmmm. Is he ready to roll the existing hate crimes law, which protects religion?).\n \n John Cox: We don't have to sanction behavior, we don't need more litigation. \"We have this problem with transvestites who want to become school teachers.\" We need to use common sense and talk about the fact that we are looking at opening the floodgates to polygamy and bestiality.\n \n Tom Tancredo: You cannot make a rule as president to change the morality of the country. The problem, he says is the influence of the homosexual agenda in the school curriculum. His solution -- a voucher system to get the kids out of the schools.\n \n Mike Huckabee: He believes the homosexual agenda has become strong because the traditional family has become weak. He's worried about what kind of role models mothers and fathers are presenting to the next generation. He doesn't want to foment hatred toward other groups, however, but wants to strengthen the family.\n \n Oh, it's pathetic. In the \"speed round\" (they vote by pressing a Y/N light) Janet Folger is going on about defunding Planned Parenthood (something they all agree on, apparently), and now Phyllis Schlafly is asking will oppose amnesty for undocumented immigrants. They are getting really uncomfortable.\n \n Sam Brownback is trying to elaborate the difference between a guest worker program (which he supports, with modifications) and \"amnesty.\" John Cox jumps in to say a guest worker program won't work either.",

   "Pace Repeats View That Gay Sex Immoral\n \n By ANNE FLAHERTY - 2 days ago\n \n WASHINGTON (AP) - Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, caused a stir at a Senate hearing Wednesday when he repeated his view that gay sex is immoral and should not be condoned by the military.\n \n Pace, who retires next week, said he was seeking to clarify similar remarks he made in spring, which he said were misreported.\n \n \"Are there wonderful Americans who happen to be homosexual serving in the military? Yes,\" he told the Senate Appropriations Committee during a hearing focused on the Pentagon's 2008 war spending request.\n \n \"We need to be very precise then, about what I said wearing my stars and being very conscious of it,\" he added. \"And that is, very simply, that we should respect those who want to serve the nation but not through the law of the land, condone activity that, in my upbringing, is counter to God's law.\"",

However, it has been debated whether or not gay human beings have the same rights straight human beings do, and between folk like you, Steve and Phyllis, it is not at all obvious that you think we do have the same rights you do. And if we do not have the same rights as human beings, the inference that we really aren't human beings is pretty logical.\n \n \nI've also never seen anyone argue that gays \"shouldn't exist\" or that they \"don't exist\".

Furthermore, arguing against gay marriage is, in point of fact, not the same as arguing that gays don't exist. The issue of gays existing isn't even at issue here.\n\n \n I haven't seen YOU make this argument, but I have seen this argument often made by Christian anti-gay bigots. We aren't \"really\" gay, we just \"choose\" to act gay. Therefore, because we are \"really\" straight and \"choose\" to act gay, we don't exist as gay people. We only exist as straight sinners who \"choose\" to act against our natural heterosexuality. That is standard nosh for religious homophobes.\n \n \nThe issue here is marriage and whether gay marriage should be legal.

If we're going to have a meaningful and productive discussion on this in society, these issues need to be represented correctly based on what they truly ARE--not rephrased in such hyperbole that it becomes inaccurate.\n\n \n The only reason to deny equality to gay people in marriages is because they aren't fully human and do not have the same rights \"real\" heterosexual human beings have. If we're going to have a meaningful and productive discussion on this in society, these issues need to be represented correctly based on what they truly ARE -- not rephrased in such euphemisms that they become inaccurate. And real discussion means recognising that homophobia denies the legitimate humanity of gay people. It insists we are either sick or sinners. Neither is true. Our sexuality is a normal and benign expression of the human range of sexuality. Until homophobes come to terms with this, gay rights will remain in jeopardy.",

   "JSDKoeln, you couldn't have misinterprited what I said worse. In face, it appears as though you just skimmed what I wrote and filled in your own biases against conservatives where you didn't read.\n \n For starters, I did not say \"left up to the states to decide\" in any context in either of my previous replies on this thread. Next, you made the word \"state\" plural. This implies the individual fifty states that make up the United States, rather than how I used the term \"state\" to refer to the entire United States of America. You also implied that I believe that it is up to individual states to debate whether or not homosexuals are human beings. This is incorrect both because I never said individual states and because I never brought up the question of whether or not homosexuals are human beings. Of coarse they are. I did, however say that it should be up to individual churches to decide whether or not they will marry same sex couples. Anything less would be the state infringing on the civil right to free practice of religion. You implied (once again, incorrectly), that I feel that state marrages shouldn't be 100% equal.
