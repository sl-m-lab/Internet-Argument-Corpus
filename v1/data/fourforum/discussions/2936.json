Asking for information on something and then deciding its a bad idea is not a flipflop, its called being informed.\nI will not respond to each of the interpretations of Kerry's votes. I yield to the consensus of opinions of the Washington political analysts who seem to agree that Kerry is the Number One Liberal Voter in Washington and that Edwards is Number Four.\n \n On the Yucca Mountain issue I offer the following links. Some of the sites are admittedly biased, but the voting records are truthfully stated. Some of the sites appear to be forgiving. \n http://209.157.64.200/focus/f-news/1172029/posts\n \n http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Jul-28-Wed-2004/news/24410184.html\n \n http://www.georgebush.com/News/Read.aspx?ID=3222\n \n http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-08-10-kerry-nuke-waste_x.htm\n \n http://www.johnfnkerry.com/\n \n http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1181024/posts\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Jul-29-Thu-2004/news/24415534.html\n \n\n In this case, the Republicans' research cited the real \"Screw Nevada\" bill. The Democrats cited an earlier vote on some of the same issues. Unlike Reid, former U.S. Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., conceded Wednesday that the GOP list of votes undercuts the Democrats' arguments. \"Although Kerry is clearly the better choice for Nevadans on nuclear waste, it does muddy up his position,\" Bryan said. \n But, Bryan also insisted, \"On the critical votes where it really counted, John Kerry would be supportive.\" \n In a Review-Journal poll released this week, 54 percent of respondents said Yucca Mountain has no influence on whether they will vote for Bush. The same percentage believe the state's leaders should keep fighting Yucca Mountain in court. \n Count on seeing Republican political ads designed to make it harder, not easier, for voters to tell the difference between the two men's positions on nuclear waste. \n In the end, Bush wants nuclear waste stored here and Kerry says he doesn't. \n Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis came out against nuclear waste in Nevada in 1988, then switched his position when he thought it would help him in Minnesota. \n Kerry is unlikely to switch, but his votes have swung both ways. \n",

   "Jim, had you still been reading the other thread listing off Kerry's votes, you'd have seen how easy it is to twist votes or statements into things that, while factually accurate, grossly misrepresent the position of the person in question. I'll reprint it here for your edification:\n \n This also gives me a great oppurtunity to show the problem with those sites that say \"Kerry voted against our troops\" or other innane things like that. Let's say that you were a member of congress, and you just voted on those amendments/bills the way u registered your support. I could put together a website that (accurately) could claim:\n -Jim's Trucking OPPOSED greater funding for homeland security and national security (Levin amendment #1)\n -OPPOSED increasing funding for veteran's healthcare (Nelson amendment)\n -voted to SHIELD gun manufacturers from lawsuits even if they were found to be GROSSLY NEGLIGENT (Levin amendment #2)\n Are these charges accurate? Yes, they are, technically. Are they fair? Not really. After all, you did also vote to increase national security spending in the Warner amendment. and your opposition to the first Levin amendment was based on the fact that it shunted funding from ABM missile defense, not because you hate the troops. But as you can see, its VERY easy to distort these sorts of things into something they're not. \n\n That's just off one POST you made here. Think about what I could put together if I trolled this entire website looking for comments. Your own article (the second LV Review-Journal one) articulates this rather nicely:\n \n The dueling \"evidence\" goes to the heart of the problem. Because of the number of procedural votes and amendments, researchers can cherry pick a vote saying someone is for or against something and have at least a kernel of truth. \n\n \n Furthermore, your explaination of why your not responding to Kerry vote list simply doesn't hold water. I've done everything I can to eliminate the bias, by listing every vote in chronological order (rather than selecting the ones that fit my views) and giving the full context, as best as I can make it out from the summaries given by your own website. To say your not going to respond to my \"interpretations\" is a blatant distortion of what is happening on that thread, and you know it. I think the real problem is that when presented with a non-distorted version of Kerry's votes that hasn't been expertly assembled by a crack team of political spinsters, the \"hyper-liberal\" label falls to pieces. To quote John Adams, \"Facts are stubborn things.\" ;-)\n \n Now, back to Yucca Mountain. First of all, notice that the votes you cite for Kerry voting in favor of the project all occured from 1987 to 1997. In otherwords, his position has been stable for 7 years now (that's from your USA Today article). Also from the same article\n \n Bush won Nevada in 2000 after promising to approve the project only on the basis of \"sound science.\" But Bush endorsed the Energy Department's recommendation even though scientific questions about the site's safety were - and still are - unresolved. \n\n So Bush flipflops on this issue from an election year promise in 2000, Kerry \"flipflops\" on it based on an uncited vote in 1997. Remind me again why Kerry's the bad guy here?",

In otherwords, his position has been stable for 7 years now (that's from your USA Today article). Also from the same article\nI will concede that points have been made for both sides of this issue. I found another site that indicates Kerry's final vote may have been (and probably was) against the proposal. Even though Edwards did vote for it, you've made you point clearly and I stand contrite.\n \n \n http://www.yuccamountain.org/archive/legal.htm\n \n At the end of the debate, the Senate held a roll call on the procedural issue. The motion to proceed passed 60-39. \n \n Ensign was one of three Republicans to oppose the motion to proceed. The others were Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado and Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island. Ensign had counted on Utah Senators Orrin Hatch and Robert Bennett, both Republicans, to oppose the motion as well. However, Hatch and Bennet announced the day before the vote that they would support Yucca Mountain. \n \n The announcement came shortly after a meeting between the two senators and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. Abraham told Hatch and Bennet that if the Yucca Mountain project were defeated, the nuclear waste could wind up in Utah at the Goshute Skull Valley Indian Reservation. \"I would rather it pass through Utah than stay in Utah,\" Senator Bennett said.\n \n Fifteen Democrats, including Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, also voted in favor of the motion. Most prominent Democrats, however, opposed the motion, including Senator Tom Daschle, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, and Senators Edward Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts.\n \n http://www.senate.gov/\n \n http://www.senate.gov/The Senate did not take a roll-call vote on the final resolution, but decided to use the procedural vote as a test. When it passed 60-39, S.J. Res. 34 was then put to a voice vote. Consequently, the resolution finalizing Yucca Mountain as a dump for 77,000 tons of the nation's nuclear waste was passed on a voice vote, relieving senators from having to defend voting on the record in favor of the proposal.  \n \n \n \n Would you like me to delete this thread?",

   "No need to delete I think.\n \n I really don't care if I've made a good point about Kerry and Yucca Mountain. The point I really want to impress upon is the ease upon which people can pick out votes and use them to support preconcieved notions about who a candidate is. I showed how it can be done to you, but we all know that you don't really oppose homeland security or anything like that. The point is you need to take these sites and analysts with a grain of salt. I'm not willing to just \"take the conventional wisdom\" at face value without looking to the facts to back it up. The facts are that, at least through October 2003 (when my vote analysis ended), Kerry has a very reasonable and defensible voting pattern. So damn the pundits, full speed ahead! An actual debate on his record, with as little distortion as possible, strikes me as far more productive and educational than dueling punditry. That's my humble opinion anyway.",
