   "A new study commissioned by the New York City Council has found that almost one-third of New York's homeless youth identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, confirming the findings of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force's groundbreaking national study, LGBT Youth: An Epidemic of Homelessness, released last December.\n ....\n The study by the Empire State Coalition of Youth and Family Services closely mirrors the findings of the Task Force/National Coalition for the Homeless report, which found that between 20 and 40 percent of homeless youth across the nation are LGBT. Both studies highlight the particular vulnerability of LGBT youth, who are too often targeted for ostracism and abuse not only at home and school, but also in the shelters where they might hope to find sanctuary.\n \n While the recent New York City study draws our attention to the terrible plight of LGBT youth, media coverage yesterday made no reference to the particular challenges and threats faced by transgender youth if they land on the streets. The Task Force report notes that transgender homeless youth are more likely to face discrimination in the traditional shelter system, more likely to find it difficult to obtain and maintain meaningful employment, and are subsequently far more likely to engage in survival sex or other risky behaviors.\n \n Foreman added, \"These findings confirm a tremendous need for LGBT-affirming programs - whether they be shelters, transitional housing or services. Research has found that fully one-quarter of homeless gay youth are forced to leave home when they come out. Where are these young people going to go? How are we as a community taking responsibility for their safety and well-being?\"\n http://www.thetaskforce.org/press/releases/pr_121907\n \n But as \"some\" people will tell you, this is really about \"acceptance\" and not wanting to hear some people tell us they think gay sex is a sin.\n Obviously, since left-handed people don't address issues like lefties being homeless, we shouldn't bring up the issue of gays who are homeless because they are ostracized. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Many of the homeless were former military. Why does this country hate its veterans do you suppose?\n\n \n I don't think it's the country at all. It's GOP indifference to anyone who isn't wealthy. I agree if there were better programs in general directed towards enabling the homeless to find and keep jobs, then gay youth would suffer less at the hands of the churches. Still, we can't expect the historical animosity of Christian churches against gay people to be wiped out overnight, and so I think that irrespective of the damage the GOP has done to social services in the US, and irrespective of the Democrats' failure to stop them or do much better, the gay community needs to take the problem more seriously.\n \n It's true as someone pointed out that there ARE gay organisations dedicated to dealing with homeless gay youth cast out by their Christian families, but from my experience of Atlanta, they aren't a priority -- the organisations are usually small and without stable or adequate funding, able to address only a small part of the problem, helping a few tens or hundreds out of the thousands or tens of thousands who could benefit. \n \n I honestly think it needs the same sort of attention gays gave to HIV, and so gay groups ought make homeless services a much higher priority. Gay youth are our future, and I think if we are a responsible community, we need to pay it some heed.\n \n I think one of the sad problems here is the fear of the Christian accusation of \"recruitment\", the slander that gay adults prey on youth. That makes it more difficult for the gay community to address the issue of youth homelessness with the dedication it really needs. Without that, I suspect gay organisations would be more responsive than they have been, but i think they really need to get over it.",

   "A hudge number of the homeless Gay children are do to parents and religious groups. I've seen it happen myself several times.\n \n Here is the difference. We take those kids, take them into legal protection, sue the church adn parents (which have lost every time).\n \n THe parents often loose custody when it is investigated. THose kids are foudn foster care, given health care, council, and returned to society.\n \n It gay individuals that care, nto christians who tell parents to send there children away. Telling the children they are not allowed in the church till TREATED.\n \n THank god for the legal system, becuase twisted churches ca finally pay.\n \n Now not all churches are this way, those that move with the times and actually realize the twisted turns of the bible, help.",
