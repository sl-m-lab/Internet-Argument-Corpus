   "What ever happened to the idea that part of the Texas lotto money generated would be used for education? Was somebody just fooling me or what?\n\n \n They just wrote in a clause that allows them to NOT use it for education if they deem it necessary, and they do so deem. Didn't you read the fine print? Oh yes, you never had the opportunity to. Neat to be the law maker and benefit from the laws that you create, isn't it? If I just had it all to do over again ;)\n \n Yes, it's now just a state tax and I'm sure a number of people, exluding the lotto winners, got rich off it too.\n \n -Mach",
