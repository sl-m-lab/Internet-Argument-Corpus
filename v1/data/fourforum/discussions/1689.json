A thousand or so votes in Florida in 2000 were extrememely important, while a few thousand votes in California or Texas, for example, don't really matter.\n \n So, does this system create too much emphasis on \"swing\" states. If you live in Florida, or maybe Tenessee, or Ohio you get much more attention, and much more catering, many more promises, and many more policies directed to appeasing you than if you live in Alabama or Massachusettes, for example.\n \n In other words, since in many ways we have a country so sharply divided politically by region, is it fair that in some states, the voters are made more important than in other states?\n \n Thanks again for your response.\n \n -Dan",

   "The swing states are there without electoral college - only worse. In Canada, its basically Ontario and Quebec, it doesn't really matter what the rest of us think of the ruling party. We elect by majority of seats, and number of seats is by population - Ontario has about 100 seats in parliament, Quebec has near that, and together they make a majority.\n \n Essentially, and sorry for making such a jumble out of this, without electoral college, the big cites are all that matters. There's a great article about it on Boundless. ( http://www.boundless.org/2000/features/a0000353.html )\n \n From article: Looking at an electoral map, with George Bush's states in red and Al Gore's in blue, the bulk of the U.S. is red. According to USA Today, Bush won in 2,434 counties nationwide, while Gore prevailed in only 677. When you calculate that in terms of square miles, Bush carried 2,427,039 square miles of America, while Gore claimed only 580, 134. \"Big city voters handed Gore a 71% to 25% landslide,\" reports USA Today's Jill Lawrence, \"while six in ten rural and small-town voters backed Bush.\" ",

It was an interesting article. And I do agree that the system gives more voice to states with smaller populations, and thus gives them more power, which has it bonuses. However, one could debate how fair this is, and there is probably no easy answer. Some would argue 'where is the fairness in electing a president that most of the people don't want? ... Sure big cites have more say in an election than small towns, but they should have, shouldn't they? ... Most people in this county live in urban areas...why shouldn't they have more say?'\n \n That is an interesting issue, but I was also interested in the fact that small states can potentially be vastly overrepresented because they are consdidered 'swing states.'

I would say that, although the smaller populations are overrepresented, it is not as bad as it would be towards the cities in the absence of the electoral college. Are cities ignored by candidates? Because, without the electoral college, rural areas would be completely ignored, as far as I can see. Maybe I'm off base with this.\n \n I think it would be much better if individual states and provinces had power over much more that they don't now. That way it wouldn't matter as much when a president is elected whom a particular state doesn't support.",

You can win an election by chasing big states and you can win chasing small states. Or a mix...\n\n \n \n OK, here is an example where things might not seem fair. \n \n The Democrats (based on the last election) would have won if they had won Florida or Texas.\n If the Democrats tried to win Texas, even if they got a million new voters (an extraordinary accomplishment) to vote for them, they would still not win the state. However, if the had won 600 votes in Florida, they would have won.\n \n So, for the 2004 election, the Democrats would love to win Florida (or Texas) but because there is not chance of them winning Texas, they will make no effort to win that state. Florida, however, since they have a chance of winning will promise to do a lot more to people there if they are elected.\n Thus if you live in Florida, you might say, that your vote is more important than if you lived in Texas.\n \n If there were no electoral college, a vote in Texas is worth just as much as a vote in Florida. There would be no need to pander to small groups in Florida to try to win that state, since it wouldnt' matter if you won that state.\n \n Oh, by the way, if you are interested in how states, counties, etc have voted in the past a great site is here",

There would be no need to pander to small groups in Florida to try to win that state, since it wouldnt' matter if you won that state. \n\n \n Thank you for this debate. I have been learning a good deal of interesting things which I wouldn't have know or cared about before. This reply is based on an excellent article on the purpose and value of the electoral college. (if you want to look at it, its here, quite thorough and very compelling: http://www.fec.gov/pdf/eleccoll.pdf)\n \n First of all, it should be noted that any candidate with a substantial majority is virtually guaranteed to win. When the race is close - and this is the beautiful part - the candidate with the greatest distribution of support is favoured. George Bush won 2,434 counties, Gore won only 677. The effect is to give individual states more power in choosing the President than they would in a popular vote. From the article I was reading: \"...the winning candidate must demonstrate both a sufficient popular support to govern as well as a sufficient distribution of that support to govern.\"\n \n I think it's important to look at the information I posted earlier again:\n \n \nLooking at an electoral map, with George Bush's states in red and Al Gore's in blue, the bulk of the U.S. is red. \n (from www.boundless.org)\n \n Without the electoral college, this particular Presidential campaign would have been taken by Gore - whose support was concentrated in comparatively few states. The elections would be determined by the heavily populated cities on the coasts, and by a few big cities scattered elsewhere. The rural population would recieve little to no consideration.\n \n While small groups in Florida will be very important in the '04 election, this will change over time - and also gives greater representation to minorities. However, without the electoral college, the rural population would be permanently ignored.",
