   "Wow, I haven't been on this forum for...a long time. This new \"Works in Progress\" section is really cool. Here's a sonnet that I've written. Let me know what you think. It's an Elizabethan sonnet, 14 lines written in iambic pentameter following the ababcdcdefefgg rhyme scheme.\n \n Lunar Skein\n \n The lunar skein abiding in the sky\n Unwinds its light into the shadowed night\n And weaves a silver sheath, a woven dye\n Of silver silk, a tincturing so slight. \n One million argent streaks of lucid lace\n Pepper the duskish skies with starry strands\n That in the dark do spin and loop and chase,\n Auroral knots forming above the sands.\n My Love does dwell there in the sterling glow,\n Her hair as brilliant as the morning sun,\n Which, shining from her radiant head does flow.\n From the celestial loom it had been spun.\n She is the knotted glow from countless beams,\n Of dancing light straight from heavenly dreams.\n \n \u00a9 2006 Phantos",
