Anymore, it is mostly used for hogs and defense.\n \n \n \nAnyone that thinks Uzi's are inaccurate definetly does'nt know enough about firearms to be telling people what kinds they can own\n\n \n Any uzi that has seen use is fairly inaccurate. This is because the uzi was designed as a short range defensive weapon that could be pushed into production rapidly. For what it is, the uzi is a fine weapon.\n \n The problem you run into with the uzis, even the good ones (my experince has been that the chinese ones are better than the israli ones. The chinese didn't blindly copy the uzi, they made some changes andd removed some known failings), is that right out of the box the barrel mountig system leaves something to be desired. Back off your barrel nut and give the barrel a twist. It will jiggle in either direction fairly easily. If your barrel was straight, this would not be much of a problem. Gun barrels are rarely completely straight. They don't need to be (put a laser on one and you may be surprised) and the cost of handf straightening them (which is the best method) is prohibitive.\n \n If you take the Uzi and mill the back of the barrel mounting flange, and where the barrel flange mates with the reciver (so you have a good, smooth mounting surface) it will do wonders for acuracy. Then, tkae the barrel and add material to the flange. Precision grind it and the mating surface on the reciver, taking all the jiggle out of it (so you can't rotate it at all even with the barrel nut loose). \n \n Now, chrome plate evrything in there (engineering grade chrome, not shiny stuff. It doesn't need to look pretty) to keep it from wearing.\n \n If you have an israeli uzi or one of the group industry or vector jobbers, pull ut the barrel trunion (requires welding) and heat treat it. The factory heat treat on these was terrible (one of the problems the chinese fixed). Now, pull your lower reciver off, remove the sear disconnector, and have a new one made that is about 3/64 taller. this will reduce the trigger pull in both distance an weight (trigger pull ont he Uzi has always been terrible). \n \n You now have a weapon that, using the proper ammunition, is capable of an accurate takedown at 300 meters or more. The 9mm, custom loaded for the S/A uzis 16\" barrel (slower burning powder but with higer charge) is a great round and is a capable medium distance round (200-300 yds). The Uzi reciever is more than capable of taking the extra pressure (unless it is a vector, in which case the back end of the reciver will start to split at the weld). \n \n Without modification, the Uzi is, in all practicality, a \"paper plate\" weapon at 100 meters (you can probably hit a paper plate if you are good).\n \n Of course, this is still better than the sigs that law enforcement officers carry, which is a paper plate weapon at 40 meters.",

At the last Topeka gun and knife show, I picked up a handful of Uzi mags (25 rd) for $5 each, a handful of Galil mags for $10 each, and a half dozen AK mags (30rd) for $5 each. They were used, of course (mil surplus I am sure), but then, so are my guns, so they match :) )\n\n \n We have them, but their nothing to get excited over. We do have knob creek though, but I'm usually busy with college during the times it's mg shoot is held each year, most people there are wanting Class III buyers anyway.\n \n \nGun shows are sometimes a good source for old AWs, depending on your location. I got the Norinco 9mm I have now in pittsburgh, Ks for $300. $800 for the same gun in Kansas City.\n\n \n I think I need someone like you to act as a scout for me, I'll get better deals that way. :P",

One of the best investments I have ever made, both from the standpoint that they are fun to play with, and that they have appreciated nicely. \n \n Rook, when you finally decide to make the plunge and get the Uzi, contact me about a gas operated trigger return system. Gives almost full auto rate of fire (mine clocks at about 500 RPM). Not quite as much fun as the open bolt, proper full auto unit, but also not $6k, nor does it require that you jump through a bunch of hoops.\n \n Also, rather than SBR it, spend the tax money on a stamp for a silencer. Have the barrel ported agressively (VERY agressively....skeletonise the thing) and the silencer will work great, even with the long barrel (short barrel length silencer). When you don't want the can on there, put on a dummy can.\n \n Takes some of the compactness away from the Uzi, but gives you something a little further forward to hold onto when you are firing full auto (or have your gas operated trigger return device enabled) for better control.",

   "Gas -operated trigger return system? Sounds interesting. I assume you keep pulling and it slaps the trigger forward while your holding it so the disconnector can reset? Anyway this could be adapted to other firearms?\n\n \n Yep, thats how it works. The trick is to shorten your trigger pull (the trigger pull on a stock uzi is TERRIBLE....6 inches and 40 lbs) to the point that the trigger just kind of ends up jiggling there. On the Uzi, what slows down the ROF is the fact that the semi auto is closed bolt. With the gas operated blowback, the trigger actually resets, then is released again, before the bolt makes it back up with the next round. If you shoot a long time, your finger will get sore unless you wear a glove. With a glove, you can roll through thousands of rounds. Unlike the hellfire and some of the other trigger return setups, the gas operated setup doesn'y throw off your accuracy.\n \n You could adapt it to other firearms if you have a well equipped machine shop and don't mind some external moving parts. the best part about doing it on the Uzi is that it is all internal except for a sleeve on the barrel (a short one), which looks cool anyway.\n \n You get your uzi and I will set you up with the parts you need. I have lots and lots of them. It gives me an almost perverse thrill to do these things.\n \n \nI've considered a suppressor as well... mind me asking a question?

Saves the hearing when you can't wear hearing protection.\n\n \n NO NO NO NO NO EXCELLENT way to end up in jail. The baffles are considered, in and of themselves, supressors. Here is the ATFs opinion on this (and no, I am not Mr Bardwell)\n \n \nDEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\n BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND FIREARMS\n WASHINGTON, DC 20226\n \n AUG 23 1999\n \n 901040:GS\n 5320/99-0115\n \n Dear Mr. Bardwell:\n \n This is in response to your letter of June 28, 1999, regarding the\n repair of a silencer by an individual owner. You ask \"whether it\n is lawful for the owner of a lawfully possessed silencer ... to\n repair that silencer himself, by replacing unserialized internal\n components with new components of his own making.\" You cited the\n replacement of a worn out plastic \"wipe\" or damaged baffle as an\n example.\n \n As you are aware, the terms \"firearm silencer\" and \"firearm\n muffler\" mean any device for silencing, muffling, or diminishing\n the report of a portable firearm, including any combination of\n parts, designed or redesigned, and intended for use in assembling\n or fabricating a firearm silencer or firearm muffler, and any part\n intended only for use in such assembly or fabrication. Thus,\n certain internal components, intended only for use in a silencer,\n are silencers as defined.\n \n If an individual made one of these parts, even for use as a\n replacement part, the individual would be making a silencer. Under\n the provisions of the National Firearms Act, any person must apply\n for and receive permission to make a silencer and pay the making\n tax for each silencer made. This would require the individual\n owner to file an ATF Form 1 application for each silencer part to\n be made with the payment of $200.00 for each application prior to\n making any replacement part.\n \n In regard to the two parts in your cited example, we consider a\n baffle to be a silencer, but a wipe, which is usually nothing more\n than a rubber or plastic disc with a hole in it, is generally not\n considered to be a silencer. Thus an individual owner could\n replace a wipe.\n \n - 2 -\n \n Mr. Bardwell\n \n For the replacement of a part or parts that meet the definition of\n a silencer, the individual owner would need to arrange for the\n transfer of the silencer to a Federal firearms licensee who is\n qualified to manufacture silencers.\n \n If you have questions about the classification of other silencer\n components, please provide us with a description of them or should\n any additional information be needed, please contact Gary Schiable\n at (202) 927-8330.\n \n \n Sincerely yours,\n \n [signed]\n Kent M. Cousins\n Chief, National Firearms Act Branch\n\n \n You CAN use your 9mm silencer on other stuff and it WILL make a big difference.\n \n Of course, then again, it is a silencer, it is quiet, who would know?",

It is placed just in front of the barrel nut and has a shroud around it (a stainless tube) with exhaust ports in it (so once the piston travels a sufficient distance, the pressure is dumped, which allows you to return the trigger to firing position). On the Uzi a rod between the piston and the trigger runs through the front had guard and into the lower receiver, so it is never exposed (which would be both ugly and dangerous).\n \n There is also a blowback operated version for battle rifles (in fact I have a G3 and a CETME sitting on my work bench right now that I am modding for my brother). You put a pivot in at the rear of the bolt travel (essentially a lever that the bolt strikes and drives rearward) the bottom end of the lever pushes forward a bar that is attached to the trigger, which drives it forward. The CETME is getting a cam, for 3 rd burst capability.\n \n Anyway, that is the incredibly simplified version. I have several thousand mods through both types of conversion and they work fine. Of course, the idea has progressed, and changed, from that outlined above for a better system.\n \n It is such a simple concept that I am surprised that it has not been done before. We went ahead and patented the systems, since a patent search yielded no similar designs.\n \n \n \n That was first generation (abviously simplified). Th",
