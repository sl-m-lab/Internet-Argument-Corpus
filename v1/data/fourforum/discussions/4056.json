While that's not important to my claim, it also casts doubt on your claim that purpose is somehow different with regards to life, and the non-living. Point in fact, HUMANS attribute purposes to things, it's not necessary that the thing itself have been created by humans. Indeed, my parents conscioussly (in my case) chose to bring a new life, me, into this world, and care for that life until it was self-sufficient. You're telling me my parents could not then have a purpose for me? How then would atheism contradict this? Nonsense. You misused, and continue to misuse the definition of atheism.\n \n So no, there is no misunderstanding on my part, but it does look as though you might have misunderstood the implcations of what you claimed.\n \n A man finds a stick that is just the right length, and has an almost perfect \"Y\" fork at the top. Just what he was looking for to hold up the right side of his shelter. This new stick now has a \"purpose\" as defined by the human. Did the stick have to be \"created by an entity\"? Or did it have to be \"an entity itself\"? No, humans routinely ascribe \"purpose\" to things as they so choose. It's a relative term, and when I make the claim, it's realtive to me. Someone else might come along and find the other side to be pointy, and they might stab the man in the shelter with it. New purpose, to a new human, irrelevant to the old purpose, or to why the stick \"is\" in the first place.\n \n You're 0/2.\n \n \nBad, bad reason. I want the barbie doll because I choose to.\n\n \n Bad, bad reason? \n \n Quite the contrary, it's the only moral reason, and the only valid reason there is. In that respect, it's not a bad, bad reason. It is \"the best reason\", or \"the only important reason\". I might even go so far as to say \"the only reason there is\".\n \n This is why we enjoy this little thing called \"freedom\", perhaps you've heard of it? Although maybe not, because many theistic cults do propose that humans are just slaves to the will of their master. I suspect all \"good\" that you think you do, was both defined by some other human, and ordered by some non-existent god. That's not morality, or choice, it's mechanical obedience (voluntary slavery).\n \n Since you don't like to take the statements and run them to their logical conclusions (or accept them in some cases), I'll demonstrate:\n \n You have these choices (choices, there is that pesky freedom word again, I know it must upset you):\n \n 1. I choose to\n 2. I choose not to\n 3. I don't choose\n \n All of these can be trumped if somone else is \"allowed\" to choose for you...i.e. they take away or you give up, your freedom of choice. They can do this by force, or by your inaction (#3), or by you VOLUNTARILY giving your choice to someone else.\n \n I propose that the best reason for Mach doing XYZ, is because of #1.\n \n You reject that as a \"bad, bad reason\". Perhaps you'd like to explain your barbie-doll fetish, but frankly, if that's your choice, to buy a savagely disproportionate female replica made of plastic, then it's the BEST reason. And like it or not, me accepting your barbie-doll need is what it is to support freedom. In contrast, many theists disapprove and want to legally restrict gays, for example, or abortion, or any number of other \"choices\" americans might make. Yet it's this fundamental misunderstanding of freedom that just...keeps...getting in the way. If necessary, I'd die to defend your right to choose a barbie-doll. Although I suspect that will never be necessary. Without freedom, there can be no choice, and choice is the \"best\" reason for any action, provided there is sufficient evidence that it doesn't unecessarily constrained another person's freedom of choice of course.\n \n \nNot necessarily. I don't care so much if I die now, but I'm not striving for it. If I were, I would think of an inventive suicide method. Why don't you want to die? Life is and will be meaningless/purposeless as it is for you now. :D\n\n \n Your choices:\n 1. Avoid death\n 2. Don't avoid death.\n \n You choose 2. \n I choose 1.\n \n Nothing more to say is there. You also contradict yourself. You say \"I'm not striving for [death]\". Which means you must be striving \"for life\". Life and death are opposites. To strive for one is to strive to avoid the other. I suspect you eat..no? This is avoidance of death. Do you sleep? Hmm, more death avoidance. Do you drive on the correct side of the road? Ho hum. Do you go to the hospital if you seem to be really sick? Maybe, maybe not...but I think it's clear now what the implcations are.\n \n You really do choose #1, even though you claim you don't. You being here is evidence that you have not committed yourself to non-avoidance of death. \n \n \n -Mach",

   "Yes, you still present the error. Atheists do not believe in contradictory nonsense (gods),\n\n Great. I'm glad most theists don't either. \n \nit's entirely possible that some other life forms, entirely within and constrained by our universe, created, or caused the creation of, the human race. Atheism does not preclude this possibility, and thus, your statement, even though obviously in error, is shown to be in error with this example.\n\n Oh right... so that's your theory. Fine by me. I won't be arguing with you on that point. We were created by aliens; I agree.\n \n Indeed, my parents conscioussly (in my case) chose to bring a new life, me, into this world, and care for that life until it was self-sufficient. You're telling me my parents could not then have a purpose for me? How then would atheism contradict this? Nonsense.\n\n What's nonsense is you not understanding my point. Your parents and anyone else in the world can presuppose a purpose on to something, but it's nonsense to proclaim that this now has any type of objective purpose. You can say a hammer is made for banging nails in, I can say it's for eating ice-cream with. Both of us are then \"giving it a purpose\", but it has no purpose in itself. That's why it's incorrect to even say, scientifically speaking, that the purpose of the eye is sight. \n \n Quite the contrary, it's the only moral reason, and the only valid reason there is. In that respect, it's not a bad, bad reason. It is \"the best reason\", or \"the only important reason\". I might even go so far as to say \"the only reason there is\".\n\n Hahaha. keep on claiming it. I sure hope your mother didn't let you answer like that. \"Why did you hit your brother?\" \"Because I wanted to\". I'd be quite surprised if your mother saw that as a justifiable reason. \n \nThis is why we enjoy this little thing called \"freedom\", perhaps you've heard of it? Although maybe not, because many theistic cults do propose that humans are just slaves to the will of their master.\n\n Funnily enough, the school of thought of fatalism is far -- or rather, FAR -- more common among atheists. The only real theistic ones I can think of are Calvinists, and they make up such a small minority of Religious persons that it's quite absurd to consider them as any signficant number in the slightest.\n \n Your argument boils down to \"I want to live forever because I want to\". This type of vacuous statement is going to get us nowhere. You haven't answered the question: whyyy should we want to?\n \nYou also contradict yourself. You say \"I'm not striving for [death]\". Which means you must be striving \"for life\". Life and death are opposites. To strive for one is to strive to avoid the other.\n\n Absolute rubbish. Your argument is on striving to live forever. Believe it or not, my main aim in life is not to live forever, since, as many people say, you'll miss out the living :D. If you want to try living forever, then change our diet, get regular excercise, live far away from the city, avoid anything that could possibly make you ill, and get a job that will give you loads of money so that you can spend it all on health treatment to help you extend your life. Make sure you're not depressed at all, since some studies have shown that stress and being depressed can be bad to your health. If you're not doing all these things, why aren't you fully striving to live for as long as possible?\n \n I suspect you eat..no? This is avoidance of death. Do you sleep? Hmm, more death avoidance. Do you drive on the correct side of the road? Ho hum. Do you go to the hospital if you seem to be really sick? Maybe, maybe not...but I think it's clear now what the implcations are.\n\n Shame that you can't understand my point. I didn't say that I wanted to die, I said that I don't care about dying so much. Some people are ultra scared of dying, don't want to (much like you). I understand that; I'm not going to subject myself to pain to die. I love my life and I love living; I'm just not going to go to absurd lengths to make myself live a few days longer.\n \n Trust me, once you've grown up you'll see things differently.\n \n To clarify, I'm kind of waiting for your argument here.

Some may think humans' purpose in life is food for the bigger animals (lions, tigers, and bears, oh my) while some may think it is to dedicate their life to God. You said it perfectly with the hammer. They are both purposes, humans give things purpose and both of those are valid purposes for a hammer.

You are a slave to God. He tells you to go to church on Sunday and you go. He tells you to pray and you do. Have you ever asked anyone at church how they know for sure that God is real? Have you ever questioned anything in the bible? It's one thing to believe it after examining it, but it's quite another to blindly believe in it and then see what's in it.\n \n\n Your argument boils down to \"I want to live forever because I want to\".

You'd include something about God but it would boil down to \"because I want to\". It's an instinct in us to want to live or else we would die as a species. Again are you claiming he wants to live forever because he doesn't want to?\n \n\n Absolute rubbish. Your argument is on striving to live forever. Believe it or not, my main aim in life is not to live forever, since, as many people say, you'll miss out the living :D.

Make sure you're not depressed at all, since some studies have shown that stress and being depressed can be bad to your health. If you're not doing all these things, why aren't you fully striving to live for as long as possible?\n \n\n Well actually since more than half the population ever on this planet is alive right now (I'm pretty sure that's right) then how do you know we aren't immortal? Not even half of the cases have proven to be mortal and we'll never know we'll die until we do. And obviously you can want something without dedicating your life to it. I want to help poor people. Does that mean I'm going to quit school and donate every penny I make to a homeless shelter? No, but I will donate some to help the poor.\n \n\n Shame that you can't understand my point. I didn't say that I wanted to die, I said that I don't care about dying so much. Some people are ultra scared of dying, don't want to (much like you). I understand that; I'm not going to subject myself to pain to die. I love my life and I love living; I'm just not going to go to absurd lengths to make myself live a few days longer.\n \n\n So you would rather live then die, right? I'm like you say you are. I want to live, but I'm going to live my life the way I want to, not so I will live longer. I will continue to play sports even though I could die from that. I will eat a healthy diet, but not go crazy over it.\n \n\n Trust me, once you've grown up you'll see things differently.\n \n\n How will we see things? I'm not sure but how do you know how old he is?\n \n\n To clarify, I'm kind of waiting for your argument here. You're saying we should strive to live forever. WHY? If you want, you can ignore all other points -- just go for this one.\n\n \n Because it's programmed into us. It's instinct. We have a natural want to live. If we didn't our species wouldn't survive.

This is just another angle of that self-evident lack of ghosts and psychics and deities.\n \n While we know it's irrational to believe in something without evidence, worst still, the object of so many theists belief isn't all that important anyway. Since indeed....anything that can be achieved, we can achieve.\n \n If there is a child with cancer, suffering, we should look to humans, not prayers, not the bible, but instead look to a human achiever, one who pushes the boundary of knowledge, and does what can be done. Through hard work, not squinty-eyed, lazy appeals to \"nothing\". \n \n That's the implication of the statement. We need no fictional saviors, we can save ourselves, not just as an obscure statement, as a LOGICAL TRUTH. I realize some support logic/reason, and others do not. I just like making sure the wedge is present, and we see them for what they really are.\n \n -Mach",

That was by no means my purpose. I just think a little respect for other's opinions is necessary.\n\n \n No, I will not.\n \n Why are you not respecting MY opinion, but instead telling me that I should refrain from essentially, expressing my reasoned opinions? You see, you cannot even abide by your own principles. That's commonly referred to as a hypocritical position. You know, like telling someone that something is \"bad\", while you're doing that same \"bad\" thing? You know the solution, it's to actually except EVERYONE'S opinion, that is, you have to accept mine, I have to accept yours.\n \n Ultimately what you're telling me is that if I have a belief, I should not express it on this forum if you, or others, haven't thought it through, or don't agree with me. That too makes no sense to me, but your opinion is welcomed, regardless of the fact that it's being made hypocritically and is aimed at curtailing my basic freedom of speech.\n \n THIS IS A DEBATE FORUM. Expect to see opinions you don't agree with, expect to see your ideas analyzed for their accuracy and logic, expect to see others challenge you, even if they don't themselves disagree with you (!). Debate is a wonderful tool, if used properly, for separating truth from falsity. It can also be fun.\n \n If you want, for instance, to argue that religion is NOT nonsense, by all means, do so. But on a debate forum, we argue, that is, provide evidence for or against a topic we disagree with (or rhetoric), and let the chips fall where they may.\n \n And welcome to the forums.\n \n -Mach",

   "Mach, I think asking someone to respect someone else's opinion is different than calling it nonsense. Did I tell you that I think you're complete nonsense, what you say and believe is complete mumbo jumbo, and that you're living a lie? No. All I said was that you could be a little more tolerant of others beliefs. I understand where you're coming from and I completely respect that. You, on the other hand, claim to know something that I don't think can truly be known and then you judge people by it, claiming that you are so above that and that religious people ought to just admit that God is not real and stop wasting their time. I think you could make an argument without being so obnoxious about it, but that's my opinion. Carry on as you like, and no I don't imagine you'd carry on any other way.",

   "\n Given two choices, the known bad and the unknown, which do you choose?\n \n Always choose the unknown. \n \n\n \n I think this faulty premise leads to to a faulty conclusion. The use of the word \"always\" renders the premise erroneous. To a first order, given no aversion to risk, one should choose the unknown if is has a higher expectation (value, using whatever metric you find appropriate) than the known bad. If not having enough cash on hand to purchase an island paradise is a known bad, one could conclude that he should wager his house and all other assets on the state lottery (the unknown). \n \n Poker players that adopted that strategy (i.e., always chose the unknown) would never under any circumstances fold a hand. The known bad would be to lose the existing pot, while the unknown would be that your opponent has even a worse hand or can be bluffed out of a better one.",
