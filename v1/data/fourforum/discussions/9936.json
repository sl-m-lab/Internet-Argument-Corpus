If the study of cultural history is any guide, perhaps American culture has served its time and purpose and is now fading away. In any case, the ambivalent attitude of the political elite towards immigration, might suggest it believes that the culture isn't worth preserving any longer........ \n \n In a generation or two, a bilingual synthesis of Hispanic and American culture will probably appear and people will ask what all the fuss was about - since history teaches that the rise and fall of cultures and empires is inexorable. \n \n James.",

   "I have a very pessimistic view of what is occurring concerning illegal immigration. \n 1. The movement itself is an in the face challenge to our legal system and our system is folding. Once those laws are proven toothless, the other parameters will successfully be challenged. \n 2. People are leaving Mexico for a better life. In essence, running. In lieu of staying in their own home which does have the resources to become a great nation, and taking the steps to create a government that works for the people. So, if they run in the face of diversity rather than stay and make home a home for themselves and those they leave behind, they pile into America and make demands of a nation stressed by war and welfare. Basically, if Mexicans are not courageous enough to fight the fights that are needed to make Mexico a wonderful place, I see nothing to look forward to. Likewise, if Americans do not have the fortitude to seal and protect their borders, they'll get what they deserve. This is not a condemnation of legal immigration. Just the mass exodus that will drain our system dry as the welfare roles swell and medical bills must be paid by tax payers and our laws fold. \n But, if any nation can withstand this it is America.",

A strong Mexico can only be an asset to the U.S. and a more amiable solution to those who seek better. While we bicker about how to treat people who ignore the laws of our land, time is wasted that could improve Mexico. Mexico is the only nation causing concern due to the numbers of illegals.

If you see \"color\" there it is your own glasses you are looking through.\n\n \n \n Allow me to skewer your point:\n \n \n Illegal Immigrants' Cost to Government Studied \n \n By Mary Fitzgerald\n Washington Post Staff Writer\n \n \n A report that found that illegal immigrants in the United States cost the federal government more than $10 billion a year -- a sum it estimated would almost triple if they were given amnesty -- has drawn criticism from immigration advocacy groups.\n \n For its report, the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that advocates tougher immigration policies, used Census Bureau figures to compare the revenue that illegal immigrants contribute through taxes with the cost of government services they use.\n \n \"Households headed by illegal aliens imposed more than $26.3 billion in costs on the federal government in 2002 and paid only $16 billion in taxes, creating a net fiscal deficit of $10.4 billion, or $2,700 per illegal household,\" said Steven A. Camarota, author of the study.\n \n The costs outlined in the report include government services such as Medicaid, medical treatment for the uninsured, food assistance programs, the federal prison and court systems, and federal aid to schools.\n \n The study acknowledged that, on average, the costs that illegal-immigrant households bear on the federal government are less than half that of other households, and that many of those costs relate to their U.S.-born children. It also pointed out that tax payments by illegal-immigrant households constitute one-fourth those of other households because of low-income jobs.\n \n \"With nearly two-thirds of illegal aliens lacking a high school degree, the primary reason they create a fiscal deficit is their low education levels and resulting low incomes and tax payments, not their legal status or heavy use of most social services,\" Camarota said.\n \n The report estimates that granting legal status to illegal immigrants would dramatically increase their cost, causing the net fiscal deficit to rise to nearly $29 billion because, the author argues, unskilled immigrants would have access to more government services while continuing to make modest tax payments.\n \n Camarota concluded in his report that the fiscal impact could be lessened only by stringently enforcing immigration laws, a view that drew criticism from some immigration specialists and advocacy groups that also accused him of not coming up with constructive recommendations.",

Sure they could help us rebuild it for less, but where will displaced American laborers go? Don't you think we should help our brother before we worry about our neighbor? We can't retrain our unskilled workforce to do much else, they are mostly people who aren't cut out for academia for myriad reasons. They have no less value in our society, but bringing in replacements to benefit the bottom lines of corporations makes them a new burden with a higher cost of living. (We could make cigarette smoking and cursing into felonies and imprison them all, which is the way we are headed.)\n \n Slighly off topic: to not learn the lesson the Europeans did about immigration is to not learn the lesson the Russians did about internal terrorism. Which is funny since Condi Rice claims she learned everything she knows from the Cold War; obviously she slept through the closing credits. Sorry, I had to get that in there.",

   "Borders are nothing more than artificial constructs.\n \n Choice is a set of intersecting needs and abilities. You can plot them on a graph and get a shape that you can call what you will. Take choice out of your equations, because it is an unknown set of integers, and will invariably lead to an incorrect solution. \n \n \"Choosing\" to cross the border illegally is based on the need for resources and the ability to get them. One could just as easily \"choose\" to run for office in one's own homeland and effect positive change, could they not? One could also \"choose\" to revolt against their government in open combat to secure their own liberty, yes? \n \n People tend to take the path of least resistance. How would America look today if we had always taken the path of least resistance? In some ways better, in some ways worse, but our \"choices\" as a nation weren't any more real than yours or mine today. \n \n Our only real choices are between thinking about the future or not, thinking about our fellow man or not, and thinking about our own best interest or not. These are just aspects of a larger process and are not choices in themselves. If you start to see your self as a set of intersecting needs and abilities, you realize that so is everyone else. Then you get the big picture-in HiDef.",

   "One difference between the immigrants of yesteryear and many of the illegals of today are that the immigrants of the early 1900's and earlier were coming here to stay. They had a reason to work hard to make the system better and improve the country for their children and their children's children.\n An extremely large percentage of those coming illegally today are coming here to earn enough money to send back to their country so they can buy land and a house and start a business etc... The problem with that is they have no reason to reinvest in the country and they have no stake in the future of the country which leads to a scorched earth policy. If people were serious about improving there lot via improving the country, we probably wouldn't even be having this discussion...",

Without it the entire economy would collapse, very quickly. That is the reason the Mexican govt. will never do anything to hinder immigration into our country and the reason that they will do as much as they can to help get people out of there and over here making money.emoticon_cool",
