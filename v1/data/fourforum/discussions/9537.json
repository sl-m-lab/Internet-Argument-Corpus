   "When a creationist makes a claim aganist evolution, they are met and refuted. Evolution accepters claim they are correct and defend their beliefs, and argue their belief is correct on the basis of its own merits\n \n When a evolution student makes a claim aganist creation the creationist pretend it doesn't exist and only respond after multiple direct requests and outright mockery. Creationists claim they are correct and cannot ever, under any circumstnace defend their belief, but claim their beliefs is correct because the other guy is wrong.\n \n What does that say about their beliefs and their characters?",
