   "I've been telling people for years that these :xcensored are evil.\n \n http://www.nbc10.com/news/9406462/detail.html\n \n An incredible video from CNBC shows an AOL customer trying to cancel his account, but a phone rep won't let him do it. What customer Vincent Ferrari got when he tried to cancel his account was a lot of frustration.\n \n It took him 15 minutes waiting on the phone just to reach a real, live person.\n \n And, what happened next was recorded by Ferrari on audio and lasted about four minutes:\n \n Check out the link for the rest, it is nothing if not entertaining.",
