   "Robert Ricker, former assistant general counsel for the National Rifle Association, makes some interesting and disturbing revelations-\n \n \nZWERDLING: Bob Ricker has had a change of heart. He spent his career fighting for the gun industry. He was the gun makers' voice in Washington DC. But now Ricker's decided to spill some of the industry's most troubling secrets....\n \n RICKER: I guess there are probably a lot of people out there in the firearms industry that are afraid of what I have to say. \n \n ZWERDLING: And what this insider says is astonishing: he says executives of America's leading gun companies know that some dealers are selling their guns to criminals &#8212; tens of thousands of crime guns every year. And the companies refuse to stop supplying those dealers.\n \n RICKER: The industry knows, and they've known for a long time, that there are bad guns dealers. There are bad distributors. And these people are the source of a large portion, or a majority of all crime guns.....\n \n ZWERDLING: Ricker says he couldn't believe it: the executives decided to ignore ATF's tracing reports. He says it was part of a careful legal strategy. Local governments began suing the gun companies in the 1990s, like the states were suing big tobacco. Ricker says gun industry lawyers figured, if the executives don't look at the tracing data, they can honestly testify, \"we don't know which of our dealers might be crooks.\"....\n \n ZWERDLING: Ricker says there's one more reason why executives at the gun companies refused to crack down on dealers: profits. One study has found that as many as 25% of all handguns sold in America end up being used in a crime. Ricker says some gun makers could go out of business if criminals couldn't buy their guns. \n \n So you're telling us that you're sitting in meetings, meeting after meeting, with top gun industry executives. You're saying folks, everybody knows how to find out who's selling guns to criminals. And these executives are telling you they don't want to do it because they don't want to hurt their profits? \n \n RICKER: Right. They don't want to know. They just don't want to hear about that....\n \n RICKER: The ATF tries to. I mean, let's just look at the numbers. Over 100,000 gun dealers out there. And how many employees does the ATF have? Or agents? \n \n ZWERDLING: Only about 2600 investigators, actually. And they're responsible for the tobacco industry, the alcohol industry, overseeing explosives &#8212; not just guns. \n \n RICKER: The ATF is overworked, understaffed and underpaid. And the industry knows that. \n \n ZWERDLING: And that's just part of the problem. The gun lobby has convinced Congress over the years to make it incredibly hard for the ATF to shut down crooked gun dealers. In fact, the NRA has called on Congress to abolish ATF.\nNOW with Bill Moyers. Transcript. April 11, 2003 | PBS \n \n So the picture that emerges is:\n The gun industry looks the other way while its dealers supply guns to criminals. It ignores the ATF's tracing reports so that gun industry executives can testify in court that they don't know which dealers are supplying the black market and because they don't want to reduce their profits by losing their criminal customers. As for the ATF, it is \"overworked, understaffed and underpaid\" in large part due to NRA's opposition and thus unable to adequately deal with the problem.",

It couldn't have anything to do with the tens of millions of dollars the NRA receives from the gun industry could it?\n\n \n Because a lot of groups have tried to bankrupt the gun industry through frivolous lawsuits.\n \n \n\"The report, Blood Money: How the Gun Industry Bankrolls the NRA, reveals that since 2005 contributions from gun industry 'corporate partners' to the NRA total between $14.7 million and $38.9 million....\n\n \n The NRA gets far more money from its 4 million members than it does from its \"corporate partners\". $25-35 in membership fees multiplied by 4 million, you do the math.\n \n As to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. AS it is right now the ATF has full authority to revoke a dealer's license at even the slightest hint of wrongdoing and effectively shut down their business. And the appeals process is both very lengthy and very costly. The feds are handling the matter, do you really need to add civil lawsuits to the proceeding? A civil suit has no place in a criminal case.\n \n I've heard it claimed that the gun industry knows full well exactly what dealers are corrupt and engaging in criminal matters. But this simply isn't true. If this information were available, like the dealer's name, the business name, the FFL license number, etc. it would be available and easy to cite, but the simple fact is that it isn't.\n \n If there were any evidence that the gun industry was supplying weapons to corrupt dealers the feds could use it to swoop in and arrest the business individuals who knew about it. But there have been no arrests of members of Smith & Wesson, Springfield Armory, GLOCK, Bushmaster, etc. So either the evidence doesn't exist or the feds are failing to do their duly assigned tasks.\n \n As it is Mexico's president Calderon is trying to sue the entire gun industry for the mess his country is in. I find it laughable and offensive at the same time. He has no grounds for suing anyone.\n \n The feds have far more power and resources than any of us do. We don't need to be getting involved in a federal matter with our silly and trivial little civil suits that're best used for stuff like fender benders and injuries suffered on a landowner's property. If there's any real wrongdoing being carried out they'll handle it. Stay out of the way and don't muck up anything in the same way mayor Bloomberg has.",

Yet, according to some in our society the manufacturers are responsible for the actions of these dealers?\n\n You may be confusing criminal law with civil law. You can be sued for negligence if you fail to do what a reasonable person would do in a situation to protect innocent people from harm. Would a reasonable person deliberately ignore ATF tracing reports and continue to supply dealers who traffick in guns with weapons because they want to maximize their profits? In a civil trial the burden of proof is a lot less than in a criminal trial. O.J. Simpson was acquitted of murder in a criminal trial. However, in a civil trial he was found guilty and had to pay millions to compensate the victims' families. \n \n \nI suppose it too much to ask for the BATF and other law enforcement agencies to substantiate the accusations against the firearm dealers who allegedly violate the law. I guess it is too much to expect that if these individuals are indeed violating the law, that they be formally charged and tried as set forth under the sixth amendment.\n \n The bottom line is this... if there were enough evidence against these dealers to warrant prosecution in a court of law, they would no longer possess an FFL. They would, as a result of lawful prosecution, lose the ability to legally buy and sell firearms. In this country it is not enough to remove someone's rights and privileges based solely on an accusation... the accusations must be proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, in a court of law.\n\n But,\n \"ZWERDLING: And that's just part of the problem.

So where do the cartels get it? According to leaked diplomatic cables, there are three sources.\n \n 1. U.S. Defense Department shipments to Latin America, known and tracked by the U.S. State Department as \"foreign military sales.\"\n \n 2. Weapons ordered by the Mexican government, tracked by the State Department as \"direct commercial sales.\"\n \n 3. Aging, but plentiful arsenals of military weapon stores in Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua.\n \n If you ever watch video or look at pictures of the drug war in Mexico, you'll notice some pretty heavy weapons. This is a war being waged with rockets and plastic explosives, not pea shooters and Saturday Night Specials. Consider these incidents:\n \n - A M26A2 fragmentation grenade used against a U.S. Consulate in Mexico in 2008\n \n - Explosive projectiles and 21 grenades found during a raid in Guadalupe\n \n Even though these facts were well-known by the Obama administration, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Eric Holder, it blamed much of the violence in Mexico on U.S. gun stores.\n \n \"More than 90 percent of the guns recovered in Mexico come from the United States, many from gun shops that line our border,\" President Obama said in February 2009.\n \n State Department cables obtained by WikiLeaks confirm that fear. One cable from November 2009 reads, \"U.S. law enforcement has fair reason to worry a number of weapons simply disappear... \" \n\n \n   El Salvador: Mexico cartels seeking army weapons \n Mexican officials have long said the most of the guns used by the cartels are smuggled in from the United States. But Gen. Munguia warned Tuesday that the Mexican gangs that have expanded into Central America are also trying to buy weapons there. \n \n \n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n  What did they find?  \n &#8220;the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&#8221; \n\n The CDC did suggest more studies. Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation funded, the study. National-Academies.org | Newsroom\n \n Here is an article about the study.  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n\n When dealing with a Inalienable, Fundamental, Constitutionally recognized as protected right, you are only allowed to have the bare minimum of laws. \n \n Not all that you want. \n \n That is why it is protected.

And there is nothing in the record to rebut that evidence.\n County only provided an expert declaration showing that criminals (without\n CCW permits) use concealed handguns to cause harm. See generally, ER, Vol. III,\n Tab 30. But County produced no evidence that denying CCWs to law-abiding\n adults would help solve that problem or reduce gun violence.23 ER, Vol. I, Tab 1 at\n 10:4-12:28. There is nothing in the record connecting a reduction in CCW permits\n to a reduction in crime - and it was County's burden to provide that evidence. In\n short, the policy and justification for it do not pass constitutional muster under any\n test. The policy is in direct contravention of the right.

But no. I was totally wrong about you guys honorable intentions. \n \n How many gun laws were created under false pretenses? The 14th Amendment was supposed to set all of this straight but the 14th Amendment was ignored. \n \n You also have proof that gun control is not crime control because we have   51 of the best gun control studies, 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study have already been done.  saying that &#8220;the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&#8221; and that does not even make a dent! \n \n We try to appeal to your fairness by showing you all of the gun control you already have.   22 to 30 thousand gun laws, and not a dent  Your attitude is akin to SHUT THE **** UP! GIVE ME ALL THAT I WANT! SHUT UP YOU A** HOLES!!! \n \n This, after we show you that all you want hasn't a prayer of working in the studies. Has not worked and recently   HERE.  and now I'll show you two more studies that won't make a dent with you, because you will just play it off like it means nothing! Well it does! \n \n It is proof that you are barking up the wrong tree. \n \n   Shotguns for \u00a350: study reveals weapons culture  \n Sawn-off shotguns are still the weapon of choice for the more serious armed criminal and can now be bought illegally for between \u00a350 and \u00a3200, according to Home Office research. A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n Even though those interviewed were in prison, many still viewed gun crime as a \"viable career option\" enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status. One man from Greater Manchester claimed he had earned \u00a352,000 in a week from gun crime. The study shows that though Nottingham is dubbed Britain's gun crime capital, guns are far more available in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\n\n \n Here is another report produced by Australian Institute of Criminology here called   Weapons, drugs and crime Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) \n \n And a article about is in the report here.\n Link  Australian Institute of Criminology study -- Tough new weapons laws 'miss hard core of criminal underworld' \nCANBERRA - The introduction of tough laws to control guns and knives appears to be failing to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of Australian criminals. &#8230;. reported that while new laws may have helped reduce the number of knives and guns in illicit circulation,  they have failed to deter hard-core criminals. It also pointed to a large firearms black market.  \n\n \n Now I know. You just want all of us, owners of the Rights you want to further infringe upon, to just shut the heck up while you sodomize the Constitution. \n \n Law test for Fundamental Right\n \n \nThe test requires proof of a compelling interest for the law, that the law is targeted narrowly and specifically at addressing the compelling interest at stake, and that the law is also the least restrictive (of the right, that is) way to deal with the compelling interest.\n",

So are you asking me to state it again for the readers? \n \n This is not just some public policy we are talking about. This is an Inalienable, Constitutionally recognized as protected Right. You are not allowed to have all of the gun control you want, only the bare minimum.

Those laws include restrictions on possession, carry, distribution, storage, transfer, manufacture, sale, ownership, importation, use and more. \n\n That's enough, especially since:==< In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n  What did they find?  \n &#8220;the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&#8221; \n\n The CDC did suggest more studies. Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation funded, the study. National-Academies.org | Newsroom\n \n Here is an article about the National Academy of Sciences study  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n\n \n They also said more study was needed, but 51 of the best gun control studies, 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study have already been done.\n \n Gun control is NOT Crime Control. So yes I fight tooth and nail against what you guys have proposed. At least so far. If you ever make a decent proposal, I'll consider it. However, the laws you guys propose, never do what you claim they will do, and only serve as a spring board for you guys to claim, See that didn't work! We need more! Or cry LOOPHOLE! These scumbags have a LOOPHOLE! \n \n So let me offer a proposal designed to test YOUR reasonableness. How about we take the laws you did get passed, and check to see if they did what you guys claimed they would do, when they were sold them to us as? If they don't, and in absolute fairness to the Constitution, we repeal all that don't come up to the standard of expectation.

I'll watch, and then if you object, you can ask me if I think it is fair. With the proviso that I am just one man, and what I think, and what I want, means exactly what it should mean. It means exactly what your opinion means. SQUAT! Exactly Squat! \n \n   FEDERALIST No. 78 \n Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former.

Problem is, they tried to pin their dirty dealings on \n Americans and dealers in this Nation following the law to demonize them and line their pockets with taxpayer money and crooked dealings.\n \n I will wait for the hearings in congress to proceed and see how these shenanigans shake out for the world to see.\n\n Okay, bury your head in the sand and pretend that no gun dealer is corrupt, that straw purchases never happen, and that unlicensed sellers do not exist.

The purpose is to hide the true identity of the actual purchaser of the firearm(s). Straw purchases are a felony violation of the Gun Control Act of 1968 for both the straw purchaser (who can be charged with lying on Federal Form 4473) and the actual possessor. Frequently, the actual purchaser is a prohibited person under federal law.\n \n If a straw purchase has occurred, does that indicate illegality on the part of the dealer? \n \n No. While firearms dealers are trained by ATF to detect suspicious behavior that may indicate a possible straw purchase, it is often difficult for the dealer to know if the person standing before him at the retail counter is a legitimate purchaser or acting as a straw purchaser (willing to lie on the Form 4473 in order to obtain the firearm). It is possible for a straw purchaser to lie on the Form 4473, pass the mandatory background NICS check and obtain the firearm without any knowledge or complicity on the part of the licensed dealer. While the purchase may have been a criminal act, it does not mean the sale by the dealer was also illegal or that the dealer is corrupt.\n \n Complicating matters, it is perfectly legal for one person to purchase a firearm as a gift for another person. For example, a grandfather for his grandson or a husband for his wife.\n \n\n \n The Truth Behind the 'Straw Man' Gun Purchase Hype\n \n So the brady bunch lies again and you bought it because YOU \"want all guns banned\".",

You've been repeating this same message of \"The NRA wants the ATF dead\" constantly, this is the third time I've seen you post the exact same message.\n \n Considering the abuse of power by the ATF I think they're deserving of being disbanded. They're currently seeking authority that exceeds what they were allotted by congress, but without congressional approval. Federal law doesn't give them authority to require sale reports of multiple shotgun and rifle sales, only handguns. But they're asking to be granted \"emergency authority\" to bypass this check and balance to the system for an undetermined length of time.\n \n The ATF is also currently working to ban future imports of certain shotguns that they don't believe fit the \"sporting requirement\" of the Gun Control Act based purely on cosmetic aspects and superfluous features that play no part in the functionality of the shotgun in question. They've already reinterpreted the law with rifles and pistols, outlawing the importation of common guns that we already make in the states. So supposedly it's alright to manufacture unfriendly weapons here locally, but it's unacceptable to import the same make and model from other countries.\n \n \nWhat was the Tiarht Amendment about? It was about protecting corrupt FFLs. Why are the gun lobby and their buddies in Congress so interested in protecting criminal gun dealers? They reveal their true colors.\n\n \n How does the Tiahrt Amendment prevent criminal prosecution of corrupt FFL dealers? Have you ever read the bill itself? The data is classified and can't be released to the public, but absolutely nothing in the bill prevents release of information for sanctioned investigations and criminal proceedings.\n \n Keep in mind Galileo that the ATF has explicitly stated that straw purchases are not a crime on the part of the dealer, but rather the buyer themselves. They go on to state further that prosecuting a straw purchaser is difficult because there are a number of unlicensed transfers that are fully legal to carry out.",

Robert Ricker, a former lawyer for the NRA and spokesman for the gun industry, explains that it's because the \"gun lobby has convinced Congress over the years to make it incredibly hard for the ATF to shut down crooked gun dealers.\" So people that have been a major obstacle to law enforcement doing its job for years hypocritically complain when law enforcement doesn't do its job properly.\n\n \n Are you really saying that a federal law enforcement agency doesn't have the authority, jurisdiction, or the power, to bring felony charges against a dealer who they know full well is violating federal law by supplying guns to people they know full well are prohibited from owning guns in the first place?\n \n The ATF has 40,000 pieces of evidence that would support their claim that corrupt FFLs are supplying guns to the criminal market. They supposedly have the names, license numbers and business addresses of these corrupt dealers. If they don't have the manpower then surely a threat of this magnitude would warrant a joint operation with the FBI correct? We're talking thousands of felonies being committed willfully. Something of this magnitude can't possibly be looked over simply because of some lobbyist group that.\n \n You stated earlier that gun ownership rates are lower than they ever have been. Meaning that the gun industry itself is running out of market, meaning they have less and less money to donate to lobbying groups to spread their message. If this is true then that would mean the ATF's power to begin with was incredibly impotent.\n \n So again we come to the same question Galileo. With 40,000 pieces of evidence at their disposal to support criminal proceedings, and a lobbyist group that's supposedly dying out, why is the ATF doing nothing about these criminals that they know about? They surely have the power to bring down corrupt dealers one at a time don't they? Or is busting one single bad guy beyond the agency's abilities?\n \n I'm not seeing how the ATF has the ability to know which dealers are corrupt, yet they can do nothing about it. It sounds like the Hollywood depiction of diplomatic immunity; you know the basic premise where a person can go into a police station, murder an officer in front of the entire force of the precinct and then declare their diplomatic status and walk right out because diplomats can't be touched for any crime they commit? \n \n That's very similar to how you're trying to sell the supposed impotence of the ATF. The only way such an argument could have any merit would be if other field agents come forward and testify under oath that they were ordered to not shut down corrupt FFL dealers because someone higher up sanctioned a specific program that would benefit from them remaining in place.",

We know that the ATF agents have a whole website entitled, Clean up ATF dot org. www.CleanUpATF.org | Homepage And now we have this article.\n \n   Fast? No. Furious? Definitely. Grassley&#8217;s statement paves way for ATF overhaul \n (Grassley) ATF encouraged gun dealers to sell to straw buyers. Emails prove that at least one dealer worried prophetically about the risk. He wrote to ATF about his concern that a border patrol agent might end up facing the wrong end of one of these guns. ATF supervisors told the dealer not to worry. So, the agents said it was a bad idea. And, the gun dealers said it was a bad idea. \n \n Why would the ATF do such a thing?\n \n \n Since the dealers were cooperating, ATF received notice of each purchase right away. Analysts entered the serial numbers into ATF&#8217;s Suspect Gun Database, usually within days of the purchase. On November 20th, one of the 34 guns Patino bought turned up in Mexico &#8212; just 14 days after he bought it in Phoenix. ATF learned of the recovery through a hit in the suspect gun database on November 24th. That same day, Patino brought Jaime Avila into a cooperating gun dealer and they bought five more guns. ATF had real-time notice from the dealers and agents rushed to the store to follow them, but arrived too late. \n\n Could it be time to do just that? That is a job for smarter people than I.\n \n One striking note is that, we never hear of stuff like this from the FBI, Treasury, Postal Inspectors, the Secret Service etc.. We have no orgs to clean them up either. Maybe this time, where there is smoke there is also fire?",

There are those whom he answered to that need to be shown the door as well.\n\n \n The ATF had even arranged and finalized an American FFL DEALER license for a corrupt Mexican gov't agency in a foreign country. Any thing to the contrary notwithstanding....this would even bypass the Secretary of State from approving firearm shipments which were plentiful by any estimation.\n \n The gungrabbers and ATF were so vocal before the truth started coming out and now, like simone, all that is left is the sound of crickets. Even Fienstien who bragged she would choose the time and place seems to have overloaded her agenda on a felony activity she wishes she had not so shamelessly associated herself with. She will look good in prison colors :)",

All arms shipped or 'fast and furious' rushed to a foreign country is not excused by an agency who issues illegal licenses either beyond their jurisdiction and title.\n \n Sipsey Street Irregulars: Media & Congress Still Missing the Big Legal Point of the Gunwalker Scandal: it was a conspiracy to illegally export weapons to a foreign country.\n \n Where are all the anti Constitutionalists now to defend their pet sic dogs who make a habit of killing people to justify a larger budget since they now break the law of Nations? Come on Sarah, diane, splc, brady and vpc. Time to reap what you have sown by aiding and abetting and putting out protective propaganda and misleading info designed to cover up and distract from the real story and evidence.\n \n Where are the usual suspects that approve of this abuse and attack on a RIGHT found in the 2A and 14A?",
