   "Interesting aside: I played chess against Jonathan Sarfati when I was a kid in New Zealand and he was a contender for national junior champion (15 years before he won the national championship). Imagine my surprise when the name showed up in this completely different context, and it turned out to be the same guy. Small world, huh?\n \n How can such a smart guy be such a fool when it comes to science? Perhaps there's an analogy to chess. In every chess club, there are certain players whose specialty is beating up on weak players, but who almost as consistently lose to the club's top tier. They have an arsenal of tricky openings and tactical motifs that they rely on, but they have little strategy and become quite flummoxed when they encounter opponents who don't give them the opportunities they're used to exploiting. Similarly, some people develop a great facility with the tactics of scientific or political debate, and use that facility to fool the weak-minded. They learn how to choose a venue, take advantage of rules, distract, deflect and distort to give their message an appearance of strength...but never bother to acquaint themselves with the actual substance of what they're talking about. They're paper tigers, preying on the uneducated while avoiding anything that resembles a fair fight (let alone one in which they're at a disadvantage).\n \n Obviously Sarfati managed to get past this plateau when it comes to chess, or he wouldn't be an International Master, but he seems quite stuck in that mode when it comes to science. If he or any of the others did show up, you can be sure it would be with a sackful of tactical tricks and nothing resembling a serious argument.",

   "What about the fact that scientific information allways changes to suit what is observed.\nScientific information doesn't change. We add more information with new observations and data, and if the new information doesn't fit into the explanation, then it too must be explained. Usually the explanations (theories) are just amended and extended to include the new data. Sometimes there is a paradigm shift when new information is so overwhelming as to upset our understanding of reality. And example is Einstein's theories of relativity upset Newtonian physics, followed by quantum mechanics, for which Einstein also laid the seeds. Others were the theories of Darwin, and then the rediscovery of the work of Mendel, which extended and verified Darwinism.\n \nIt isnt consistent.\nSure it is. Science consistently offers the best explanation that we can offer for the empirical evidence. I guess it would be preferable to deny science because it conflicts with dogma like creationists do.\n \nDont get me wrong, I am facinated with science, and agree with a lot of what It has proven, but I dont think that the bible should be discarded as a piece of fiction.\nI don't get you wrong. You haven't bothered to educate yourself about science, and then you oppose it here on these boards. You think science is proven or that it proves something. You also seem to think that the practice of science is somehow concerned with the Bible. The problems of science with the Bible and the perception that science somehow rejects the Bible is your view.

Sorry to disappoint you but, Answers in Genesis occasionally gets correspondence to request our assistance with or participation in an \"online discussion forum.\" Many times this request comes because someone has made accusations against AiG in the forum or when an individual has brought up a particular point that appears to need a refutation or assistance. AiG does not participate in such arenas for various reasons. Some suggestions for those involved in debate boards are:\n \n \n \n 1) Check every fact, statement, or interpretation of the facts. It may be helpful to review these introductory articles.\n \n Creation: Where's the proof? \n Searching for the 'magic bullet' \n If it's a Christian discussion forum and the age of the earth comes up, start with the assumption of biblical authority:\n \n A young earth-it's not the issue!\n \n 2) Do not trust \"scientific refutations\" of AiG material that appear to be well constructed. Check every fact, assumption as well as logic. Challenge topics such as this for their peer reviewed source. Remember, there is a difference between a fact and an interpretation of a fact. \n \n \n \n 3) Check Arguments creationists should NOT use to make sure you are not using poor or outdated points.\n \n \n \n 4) Review a number of the Past Feedback Archives for examples of how to respond to non-biblical postings.\n \n \n \n 5) Research topics you need help on by searching the AiG Q&A Topics. Make sure, for example, that you don't confuse mutations and natural selection which are biblical with molecules-to-man evolution. \n \n \n \n I pray that this information is helpful to you.

Of course we see that something is wrong with this line of thinking.\n\n I'm sorry, but that's really all the term \"peer-review\" boils down to.\n \n \"Can you convince people that are experts in your field (just like you) that your paper is worthy of publication?\" \n \n That's really it.\n \n Whether it's civil engineers reviewing a civil engineering paper, a priest or a monk reviewing a theology paper, a group of 8 year olds reviewing a theory about Santa Claus to publish in Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Sinterclaus Forschung, or YEC's reviewing a YEC paper for publication in a YEC journal.\n \n I know all the rest of what you said pertains to peer-review in scientific journals, and you also specified that you did not intend to make your explanation the final definition of the term, but I just wanted to make clear that it is perfectly all right for them to claim that the YEC journal is peer-reviewed.\n \n \n \nThough this is not meant to be a definition, the term peer-reviewed actually means allowing the scientific community at large to review your work and point out problems with it. A peer-reviewed journal would be one in which representatives of the scientific community at large review your work before publishing it (but if those scientific peers find it to not meet standards for scientific accuracy and the like, rejecting it instead), and that also allows objections to it, from the scientific community at large, to be published in the same journal.\n\n This is all true, although, at least in my field, papers are sent to a handful of people. I mean hundreds of thousands of papers are published every year. The \"community at large\" that reviews a paper can't usually be more than a few people working along the same lines as you, and are likely competitors. \n \n So, if you make it past these 3-5 people, and the paper is in a nice format for the editors, you're finally accepted.\n \n \n \nYECs don't do the above things in their little \"peer-reviewed\" journal. So they should always use quotes for the term \"peer-reviewed\" in order to show that a non-standard meaning is being used. If they don't, then they are guilty of equivocation.\n\n I don't know if these people are implying that these journals publish \"scientific research\" or not. If they are, then that's where they are lying (either to themselves or others). But, it doesn't mean that their journal is worth a damn.\n \n You know. There are even scientific journals that are crappy, mainly for their low standards. And there's usually this somewhat arbitrary Tier system set up in people's heads as to top tier journals and middle and bottom tiers.\n \n The trust people put in the paper is generally proportional to the prestige of the journal it's published in usually.\n \n So, anyway, I guess these folks are trumpetting the fact that their journals are \"peer-reviewed\" to give the impression to the unsuspecting that this means it's the Truth.",

Good job ... but this seems to be the exception, not the rule.\n \n Further, note how they turn around and mislead by saying that it is \"peer reviewed\" by what? By \"a diverse group of highly qualified scientists\". What?! If one bothers to see what note 1 says s/he'll see that, \"TJ is an open forum for healthy debate among believers in a young Earth.\" \n \n The proper statement would have been:\n \n \n\"No matter what the author's age or position, all submissions receive a fair opportunity to be rigorously 'peer reviewed' by a diverse group of Young-Earth Creationists\".\n\n \n But that would kind of ruin the image they are trying to create of it bein a peer reviewed SCIENCE journal.\n \n And note what AiG calls this 14-year-old's submission ...\n \n \n\"When Chase submitted his research paper ...\" (http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2003/0603nelson.asp) \n \n \n Ah yes, surely it was a RESEARCH PAPER published in a SCIENCE journal, after a diverse group of HIGHLY QUALIFIED SCIENTISTS subjected it to rigorous PEER REVIEW!!! Gee, what's the difference between TJ and Science or Nature?!?!?!?!?!?!\n \n And at the bottom of the page, we are told a bit about what TJ is ...\n \n \n\"TJ has often been called the creationist world's premier scientific publication. It is peer reviewed [NO quotes to indicate non-standard usage] by highly qualified academics, mostly Ph.D. scientists. Because of mainstream censorship of their ideas, creationists need a forum where their models can be openly debated with honesty and integrity. Such careful scrutiny is essential to good science. The mainstream censorship makes it easy for critics to misrepresent creationist ideas, but there is a place where people can go to see the latest in the real debate-TJ.\" (http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2003/0603nelson.asp) \n\n \n Note that it says their peer reviewed [sic] journal is a SCIENTIFIC publication, and NOT a YEC publication. Wrong.\n \n Note also that it says their scientific [sic] journal is peer reviewed [sic] by highly qualified academics, mostly Ph.D. SCIENTISTS. Again, it doesn't say it's peer reviewed by YECs, which would be correct, but by SCIENTISTS, which is misleading ... and in fact incorrect when one cosiders what it really means to be peer reviewed by highly qualified scientists.\n \n And then it states that contrary to the 'corrupt and evil' mainstream scientists (who can't be honest and have no integrity), those who publish in this peer reviewed [sic] scientific [sic] journal TJ practice good SCIENCE [sic], by allowing their ideas to be \"openly debated with honesty and integrity\" [sic].\n \n \n ***************************************\n \n And on another page at AiG I found this...\n \n \n\"It is now claimed, on Thewissen's web site, that more material has been found. As far as I am aware, none of this extra material has been subjected to peer review. That is, it has not been published in a refereed scientific journal. As such, it is not admissible as scientific evidence (evolutionists are quick to demand this of creationists)\". (http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v8/i1/whale.asp ) \n\n \n Note how Don Batten, from AiG, \"defines\" something's being subjected to peer review: being published in a refereed scientific journal. And note also that his last statement implies that the refereed scientific journal must be a mainstream, as opposed to YEC, journal.\n \n \n ***************************\n \n And from another AiG page...\n \n \n\"Furthermore, I would say that, for the keen creationist, whether you are a scientist or layperson, TJ is a mandatory read. Here's why:\n \n ...\n \n Articles are peer reviewed. In spite of the criticism by some evolutionists that creationism does not stand up under scrutiny, our forum allows for a healthy and sometimes vigorous debate of ideas. Applying the Biblical principle of 'iron sharpening iron' (Proverbs 27:17). (http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2002/0326tj.asp) \n\n \n Note that the statement implies that creationism stands up under scrutiny by evolutionists, and that this is part of his explanation of the journal's being peer reviewed. Thus, this is implying that the peer review is not limited to just other YECs, but evolutionists too.\n \n \n *************************\n \n How about one more...\n \n \n\"AiG scientist Dr Jonathan Sarfati, after detailed peer review from theologians and scientists worldwide, has now completed the 411-page book Refuting Compromise.\" (http://www.answersingenesis.org/us/newsletters/0304lead.asp) \n\n \n Note how it says Sarfati's book was peer reviewed by SCIENTISTS ... WORLWIDE! It does NOT say it was peer reviewed by YECs worldwide. Yet clearly the anti-science, religiously motivated material in the book would not pass peer review by representatives of the scientific community at large - by experts in the fields of science referenced.",

   "AiG scientist Dr Jonathan Sarfati, after detailed peer review from theologians and scientists worldwide, has now completed the 411-page book Refuting Compromise.\nI notice that Sarfati's book was \"peer reviewed\" by theologians as well as scientists. So you might expect that this book, if it is true to the creationist straw man idea of \"evolution\", presents arguments on everything from cosmology to molecular biology. Can we assume that the parts on cosmology were reviewed by cosmologists, the parts on geology by geologists, and the parts on biology by biologists? Not a chance.\n \n Numbers of creationists among real scientists have been reported in various sources. Sometimes they report that as much as 5% of those with degrees in fields of science are YECs. However, more than 99% of biologists and geologists reject YEC and accept evolutionary theory. The field with the most creationists is chemistry. Wonder of wonders, Sarfati is a chemist.\n \n So what qualifies him to speak about geology, biology, or cosmology?",

   "Maybe this will help you out.\n\n All I'm going to say about your extremely longwinded post is that you \"moved the goalposts\" (if there were any to begin with).\n \n I never claimed that any YEC journal was a science journal.\n They may claim that, but I don't support the claim.\n \n But if they submit their papers to any form of a peer review process then they can accurately claim to be a peer-reviewed journal.\n \n Also, I'd like to explain to you that merely because a paper, scientific or not, makes it past the peer review process, it doesn't mean that the paper is a good one or that it is correct and accurate.\n \n I can think of a few instances where papers got past the peer review process to get into Science, but later were found to contain fabricated data.\n \n Just google Jan Hendrik Schon.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Hendrik_Sch%C3%B6n\n \n  It was disturbing to some that none of Sch\u00f6n's misrepresentations were caught by the peer review process, which is designed to find errors rather than detect fraud.\n \n \n \n \n The most recent paper I had to review was from some chinese group (why do I always get the Chinese ones?) and I did what I always do. I spend a whopping few hours (depending on the length of the paper) on it and I just check to see if they were detailed enough in their experimental section for the experiments to be reproduced, if their sources are all in line and accurately cited or if they missed citing sources critical to their paper, and if, to the best of my knowledge they haven't drawn any faulty conclusions.\n \n I'm certainly no world-class expert on the subject of their paper, but I was enough of one to detect any errors in the paper with regard to the part of their paper that dealt in my area. I am certianly no expert on the atmospheric pressure plasma technique they used (and presumably developed themselves) and hope that one of the other referees was enough of one to see anything that was glaring. I'm sure after a couple of rounds of review, the paper will be published (in what i consider a mid-tier journal). I doubt they were fraudulent, but honestly I have no way of knowing whether they were or not.\n \n \n edit:\n Oh yeah, I forgot the first and foremost reason for peer-review and the first thing you do.\n \n Is it novel? or is your work too close to previous work?\n \n That's all.

A paper that is reviewed on its religious correctness rather than the science presented can't be claimed to be a peer reviewed scientific paper. Just the term, \"peer reviewed scientific literature\" implies that it is the science that is peer reviewed. There is no implication of any religious correctness. But the TJ publishes a paper from a 14 year old who's science is on that level while his religious dogma toes the line. That's peer review to a YEC.",

A peer-reviewed journal would be one in which representatives of the scientific community at large review your work before publishing it (but if those scientific peers find it to not meet standards for scientific accuracy and the like, rejecting it instead), and that also allows objections to it, from the scientific community at large, to be published in the same journal. \n \n YECs don't do the above things in their little \"peer-reviewed\" journal.
