   "There is a painting in my window.\n \n It really isn't a painting, but a stained glass. It is three roses, married into harmony by the soft strokes of a paint brush.\n \n It hangs in the family room, watching us as we laugh, play, cry, sulk, think, and grow. Wrinkles deepen the faces of the people who visit and call, but the picture is immortal. Long after I'm gone, with care and attention, it will still be here. A testament to the patience and determination of one person. \n \n Her name is Sandra and she is both older and wiser than I am. Her house is small and comfortable, and when I'm there I feel myself, which, coincidentally, is not always a comfortable feeling. She makes me think and laugh and smile and remember. I remember that people come from everywhere and some even come from nowhere it seems, and yet we are all the same. All birds of a feather, desperate to be heard and seen while we're here. \n \n My mother knew her first, and she is the only person that gives my mother such a happy look in her eyes when she talks about her. I can tell that she gets flustered when talking about Sandra because there is simply no way to understand what an amazing person she is without knowing her. In a lot of ways she is like the painting she did.\n \n Light filters through my picture the same way love filters through Sandra. Some of it catches in the painting itself, warming the colors and brightening the scene, but so much more of it simply shines through, to hit me, the couch, the dog, or maybe even, at times, nothing at all in particular. But it shines either way. Once you've seen it happen, there is simply no way to wrap it in paper and hide it away. It is an object that deserves to be seen.\n \n I would like to propose a toast to everyone of every age. To the people who know the answers and have stopped searching, and to those who have barely opened the book. To the people who view the world in a rose-colored tint, and to those who filter it in a rougher medium. And most of all, I would like to raise my glass to those who looked around to the flock and up to the light of day, in harmony, to see life for what It is.\n \n To quote a famous harmonica player,\n \"Leave your stepping stones behind, there's something that calls for you.\"\n -Bob Dylan",
