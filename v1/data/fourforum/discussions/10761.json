   "The recent controversy involving Barack Obama with his pastor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, Jr., is a perfect example of why sermons need to be published. \n \n Who would have believed that this right reverend was spewing such hate in the very heartland of America--Chicago--from his pulpit? And, of course, Obama was unaware of any \"inflammatory and appaling remarks\" the most holy reverend likes to spew on a regular basis. \n \n That's why we should insist that sermons be published on line. We can't allow the pulpit to simply go unchallenged in this day and age. \n \n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080315/pl_nm/usa_politics_obama_dc_1",

   "Ummm...\n \n Sermons are quite often published and more readily made available to the public.\n \n 1) Like with College papers and essays, a lazy (or really, really busy) pastor can go to a web site and BUY a ore-made sermon that's guarantees to sway the congregation.\n I've experienced numberous debates on whether this is an ethical practice. In churches and out. Some pastors maintain that they have too many duties and with cuts and lack of decent tith support, find it hard to meet their obligations and prepare a sermon that could last a couple of hours, so such services assist them. More so if they feel a need to cover material their congregation is in need of and they don't have a 'calling' or experience with.\n Others say it's simply plagarism and a sign of a poor pastor.\n \n 2) Pimp churches tend to have a tendency to TAPE and record nearly every aspect of their sermons for re-sale to those who might find them inspirational to listen on the DVD player or even in their car. They are also for those who couldn't make it to the sermon (of which they can have 2 on Sundays and 1 on every other day of the week if their sheeple beg for that still water and have pockets that need fleecing).\n \n I firmly believe, from observation and past experiences, that this pastor had taped his sermon. Excerpts have ended up on TV and the like.]\n He's a 'pulpit pimp'.\n If getting a copy is currently hard it's due to an internal censoring issue where the pastor and loyal followers rushed to prevent his faux pas from being pushed too far in the national media.\n \n \n If you're ever able, visit his church. I'm sure recordings are available for a modest price (erm, donation) in the place traditionally reserved for money changing and the selling of sacrifices.\n \n \n But, I could be wrong.\n \n \n As to this particular pimps sermon...wasn't he getting a little too politically oriented?\n Should fit what you're calling for in the way of checks and balances in regards to seperation of church and state.",

Here is the link for my favorite bible \"teacher\" as opposed to a preacher which I don't find any interest in at this stage of my life. http://costamesa.calvarychapel.com/pages/audioarchive You can click on any of Pastor Chuck Smiths messages from as recently as last sunday and this past weeks meetings. Just click on last sundays message and minimize the window so you can listen to one of his messages as you continue to browse, to see how evil he is. I dare you.\n \n Most church's today with websites have this same service you're recommending available for their parishioners so they can stay connected to the body of believers even if they can't make it on sunday, or any of the services that interest them. And you will also find a comment link for Calvary Chapel too, as Pastor Chuck has nothing at all to hide regarding the content of his messages. \n \n And regarding Rev. Wright attracting christian hate mongers to his pews; did you happen to notice that it was I who pointed at, and exposed his hate speech HERE on march 2nd, 2+ full weeks before the National Media even mentioned it as an issue? So apparently we christians within my spiritual community have been aware of him for some time, but rather than embrace him we condemned what he represents, as I did here on this very forum.

Many of these congregations have been together for years.\n\n \n I believe your insight into who is leading whom is correct. The pew certainly can and does influence what the pulpit is saying. All the more reason why we need to open up the church services and find out what's going on. Archangel is of the impression that the practice of publishing sermons was discontinued because some atheists got in a lather over church/state separation. Not so at all. When petty little bigotries and overt racism were reduced to black and white words on paper, church officials became alarmed. \n \n One of two things could have happened: Stop the behavior or try to hide it. For the most part, the latter was chosen. Some churches were embarassed enough to modify their messages, and in this way progress was made. It is my opinion the last bastion of all discriminatory practices is found in some of our churches and mosques. \n \n And it may be good to ask, why wouldn't a particular church not want to reach a wider audience? Are they aware their message is tinged with hatred? If a sermon is true, it's true for all members of the human race, IMO. If a preacher is too reticent to have his message heard by others who differ from him in something as inconsequential as skin color, I would suggest his sermon needs tweaking. \n \n I'm all for embarassing these churches and the people who fill the pews in direct support. This is how social change comes about.\n \n \n\n Moreover, much can be lost in the written word. \n\n \n Perhaps, but this seems a small concern. Remember, I'm advocating comments from the readers, which could certainly allow for any misinterpretations to be corrected. This is no small feature of my proposal, it actually contains the seeds which could eventually lead to a higher truth and understanding. \n \n \n\n Not sure what church you have been going to. May I suggest a different one. My experience has been different\n\n \n I was raised in the Lutheran experience. Every Sunday, my pastor would smile and tell me that God loved me.

It really doesn't compare to the 100 member church that is meeting out of a strip mall and attempting to do some good in the community. Why not remove the tax exempt status of all non-profit organizations in the name of Wal-Mart's community giving and outreach?\n\n \n I'm not sure what you're getting at here.\n \n \n \n\n Mine is simpler and cheaper. If you care to know - GO. If you are not invested enough to warm a pew why should I think that you would sift through pages upon pages of church postings looking for little nuggets of racism, bigotry, and hatred OH MY!!?\n\n \n Publishing sermons online would simplify the task of monitoring churches' behavoirs. I can't be in all places. I can't look under every rock. \n \n \n\n Curious: since you are concerned about hatred, racism, and bigotry being spewed, would you similarly call for all lectures made in academia to be so published at the expense of the schools? \n\n \n It would be hypocritical of me to say that I would be against that.

However ineffective you might claim this sort of practice to be, I see a significant lever that could be used to get compliance: community pressure. Why is the United Holy Church of White Brotherhood not providing a transcription of its weekly sermons, say? What's going on there? What are they afraid of? Why not spread the good news from the Good Book a little farther and publish what you preach, pastor of the UHCWB? Do you believe what you preach? You're not ashamed of what is being said, are you? \n \n I am in complete agreement with you in regard to your disdain of government interference. I try to watch my State Legislature during the days that they are in session and the event is televised.

   "I believe your insight into who is leading whom is correct. The pew certainly can and does influence what the pulpit is saying. All the more reason why we need to open up the church services and find out what's going on. Archangel is of the impression that the practice of publishing sermons was discontinued because some atheists got in a lather over church/state separation. Not so at all. When petty little bigotries and overt racism were reduced to black and white words on paper, church officials became alarmed. \n\n \n I would agree with ye that sermons were not discontinued because of the rise of atheism. The real reason that they were discontinued is the same reason why your idea would not be as effective as you think: They were BORING. My earlier point was that if folks are not willing to invest the energy to go to the church for the service, they are less likely to interupt a busy schedule of Simpsons, Football, and cyber porn to do a web search for Revererend Playfair's latest epistle on the evils of ballroom dancing.\n \n \nAnd it may be good to ask, why wouldn't a particular church not want to reach a wider audience? Are they aware their message is tinged with hatred? If a sermon is true, it's true for all members of the human race, IMO. If a preacher is too reticent to have his message heard by others who differ from him in something as inconsequential as skin color, I would suggest his sermon needs tweaking. \n \n I'm all for embarassing these churches and the people who fill the pews in direct support. This is how social change comes about.\n\n \n But I think most Churches are not out to reach people across the coast. They are ministering to their local community. Basically, the intended audience is the folks who show up and put $$$$ in the collection plate. If the congregants approve the sermons they will continue to put $$$ in the plate. If not, the plate goes bare and the pastor goes the way of Old Mother Hubbard's Dog.\n \n \nPerhaps, but this seems a small concern. Remember, I'm advocating comments from the readers, which could certainly allow for any misinterpretations to be corrected. This is no small feature of my proposal, it actually contains the seeds which could eventually lead to a higher truth and understanding. \n\n \n I just don't think the local church in Weaselbutt Kentucky is interested in opening a dialogue with a pundit from outside Weaselbutt Kentucky. Why should they be? Again sir, the PLATE!!!\n \n \nI was raised in the Lutheran experience. Every Sunday, my pastor would smile and tell me that God loved me. He would say that Jesus did too. The Holy Ghost had warm feelings for me as well, I was told most assuredly. All of this love-talk was rather boring, and eventually I found the sermon was a good time to think happy thoughts, like \"In one hour I will be on the lake fishing.\" I would probably gloss over the Lutheran online sermons, and I would advise you to do so as well in the interest of maintaining a bit of an edge, which is useful in negotiating life.\n\n \n Well this brings up an interesting consideration: Those who have grown up within the Church are less likely to challenge those church authority figures. Intellectual honesty compels me to admit that I had not considered this earlier. Nevertheless, statistics show that folks change churches as often as they change shoes nowadays. Churchs more than ever are subject to the market. If you don't sell a product the public agreess with: No $$$ in the plate. I agree with you that after 10 minutes my mind wanders. It is for that reason that I seldom attend church these days. The singing, the gadding about. I just want some insight on the sciptures please, no Hollywood.\n \n \n \n \nI'm not sure what you're getting at here.\n\n \n Forgive me for being obtuse. You noted that Wal-Mart was a force in local giving despite the fact that they were not tax exempt. My attempt was to note that a multi-national company is not on the same playing field as the small local church that is scraping to pay its pastor and be a force of good in the community. \n \n\n Publishing sermons online would simplify the task of monitoring churches' behavoirs. I can't be in all places. I can't look under every rock. \n\n \n Nor can you review the published records of all the sermons of all the churches, that was my point sir. \n \n \nIt would be hypocritical of me to say that I would be against that. I'm for more openness in all areas where ideas are tossed about.\n\n \n It would be intellectually dishonest of me to deny that I would be happy to hear that the predominantly left-wing halls of academia were subject to full disclosure. Nevertheless, I realize that the constitution protects speech with which I disagree. That nut job professor has every right to natter on in spewing nitwittery. The difference is, the nut job in the pulpit does not have tenure.\n \n \n If I don't miss my mark, I would say that your suggestion is a response to the latest Obama preacher claptrap. That, along with other high-profile nit-wittery from mega-church directors may make it appear that there is something sinister afoot in the pulpits of America. Rather, I hold that the majority of Churches are small, work in the local community, and have no real desire to impact outside their town or county boundaries. \n \n I could not imagine the poor old woman who types the minutes of the First Baptist Church of Seddon, AL (population 260) trying to figure out how to get online to satisfy your curiosity about last week's sermon.",

These types of activities would have repercussions in the community, IMO. People's interest would be piqued to the point that they begin to show up on Sunday morning to find out what it is that's being hidden. This isn't exactly a boon to the church, and the preacher could be forced to temper his message with all the strange ears suddenly listening. \n \n I could easily see the first scenario you describe occuring--where the preacher quietly relays to the transcriber to \"just skip this part, okay?\" But somebody who was there that Sunday (it only takes one!) would happily chime in on the comments section that a juicy portion of the sermon was missing online.

   "I thought that was what 'middle class' was an economic definition. Isn't it?\n\n \n Not really, a lottery winner with no education and no job doesn't suddenly become upper class because they have money. Class is a socio-economic definition - education and attitudes are as important if not more important than an evaluation of assets. For example, the widening participation agenda in UK universities is based on parental occupation and education, not on income. So, a university is deemed to be successful at widening participation if it admits students with no family history of higher education, or where parents work in manual occupations, but not students whose parents are well educated but choose to work in less economically profitable occupations. By an economic definition, the people I know who choose to live in yurts in the Lancashire countryside would be consider lower class, but any measure of attitudes, education and background would call them firmly middle class.\n \n It's probable that definitions vary from country to country, but it is clear that in the US class is not just about money. Politicians make a great show of how (despite their millions passed on in intergenerational wealth) they're just ordinary people who like ordinary things.

   "I always thought \"red neck\" was a term used to describe people with the traits outlined in the post/rant above, not all people from the southern US. We use the term here in Canada to describe a person who is ignorant, racist, often overly-religious, and proud of his ignorance and intolerance.\n\n \n You would be way off in that thought tq. In fact, the term redneck has a proud origin in America as it was a term given to West Virginia Coal Miners who wore red bandanas for solidarity in their fight to unionize.\n The most probable beginning of redneck comes from The West Virginia Coal Miners March or the Battle of Blair Mountain when coal miners wore red bandanas around their necks to identify themselves as seeking the opportunity to unionize. This eventually led to lower classes being called rednecks.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redneck_%28stereotype%29#Etymology\n \n And then there are these other possible origins of the term, none of which include religious people fitting that description anywhere. Only the truly ignorant would make such an outrageous and bigoted claim.\n  Another popular but unlikely etymology says that the term derives from such individuals having a red neck caused by working outdoors in the sunlight over the course of their lifetime. The effect of decades of direct sunlight on the exposed skin of the back of the neck not only reddens fair skin, but renders it leathery and tough, and typically very wrinkled and spotted by late middle age (a condition called cutis rhomboidalis nuchae). Similarly, some historians claim that the term redneck originated in 17th century Virginia, because fair-skinned unfree labourers were sunburnt while tending plantation crops.\n Another popular etymology is that the term was originally used by African Americans as a pejorative for white people in general, in the same manner that peckerwood and ofay were coined by blacks.\n It is clear that by the post-Reconstruction era (after the departure of Federal troops from the American South in 1874-1878), the term had worked its way into popular usage. Several blackface minstrel shows used the word in a derogatory manner, comparing slave life over that of the poor rural whites. This may have much to do with the social, political and economic struggle between Populists, the Redeemers and Republican Carpetbaggers of the post-Civil War South and Appalachia, where the new middle class of the South (professionals, bankers, industrialists) displaced the pre-war planter class as the leaders of the Southern states. The Populist movement, with its message of economic equality, represented a threat to the status quo. The use of a derogative term, such as redneck to belittle the working class, would have assisted in the gradual disenfranchisement of most of the Southern lower class, both black and white, which occurred by 1910.",

Now, if someone gets upset at that, well, if the shoe fits, wear it.\n\n \n Weak. The same arguments are used by those caught using the N-Bomb or any other racially charged word. It doesn't fly there and it doesn't fly here. You can't broad-brush a people and then backpeddle out of your ignorance and hate.\n \n What next? Are you going to talk about how you have \"a friend who is Southern\"?",

   "I'd like to get some other's opinions on the whole 'word' debate. I mean, yes there are better, more articulate ways to get one's point across than using racial epithets, curse words, and name calling in general. But sometime there are words that fit. Whether it be racial or just calling someone A-hole.\n \n Or is that not the case? Should some words be off limits or should all or none? I'll start a thread about this elsewhere and we can talk about it!\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=11087",
