I don't think you all are against it being rare, and I don't think you push for it to be prevalent. But I think you would agree that making abortion rare has not traditionally been a pro-choice goal. It IS getting to be more of a pro-choice goal in recent years. Clinton wanted it to be rare, as does Ted Kennedy now. I think the reason that pro-choicers are starting to consider it more important for abortion to be rare is at least in part due to the influence of the pro-life movement. You may disagree, but I do know that Kennedy has never indicated the need for it to be rare until after recent election results where pro-lifers made their voices heard through their votes. Democrats seem to be realizing that they need to at least meet us halfway by noting the value of life and making abortion rare, and I hope this is indicative of the pro-choice movement itself.\n \n - Though you've tended to disagree with me, I DO think it is more the goal of pro-lifers to make abortion rare. Every pro-lifer I've ever talked to wanted to see abortion ended, and that was their goal period. It wasn't a desire to \"control women\" or \"take away their rights\", they simply wanted to save needlessly killed lives of the unborn. I won't argue that the result of this goal was to take away a right from women, but it wasn't the ultimate goal.\n \n You are basically implying that if pro-lifers wouldn't oppose the pro-choice movement, you all could work more toward making it rare. Do you really think that a lot of the pro-choice people in your movement would put as much effort into making rare as you do trying to make it legal? Based on the efforts to make it rare so far, I don't think so.\n \n However, things are changing, and I think more and more pro-choicers are starting to meet pro-lifers half way, and see that, as Kennedy says \"we are a better society when abortions are rare.\"",

Based on the efforts to make it rare so far, I don't think so.\n\n \n All else you said has been rehashed in other threads and you know my view. I want to comment on this.\n \n No, I said all the reasonable people. I do not believe all pro-choice people are reasonable, or even the majority of them (in America at least). But I do know that the pro-choice position (as I interpret it, at least ;) ) is more reasonable than any pro-life position. Am I an egomaniac or what?\n \n And no, I do not believe \"pro-choice people\" (speaking in terms of politics) would work toward the goal of making it rare. I firmly believe that it will only happen with a massive re-ordering of our society, respecting what women and mothers go through in all aspects of life. I don't think that will happen no matter if abortion is legal or illegal. I firmly believe that abortion is a symptom of ills with society and society's view of women throughout the ages, and the fact that women have not been able to 100% control if they become pregnant. The only reason it is out of the shadows, so to speak, is that we have the technology to have safe and effective abortions. Making abortion illegal will not make it go away and will only add insult to injury by violating women's rights.\n \n As I've said, abortion will not be rarer because of litigation no matter if \"pro-life people\" or \"pro-choice people\" have their way. Women themselves need to be supported and respected in order for that to happen. Making abortion illegal will not curb abortions,it violates rights and shows extreme disrespect to women. Keeping abortion legal may not curb them itself (only the personal views of women will do that), but it shows respect for women and their choices and it does not violate women's rights either.\n \n I believe keeping abortion legal is the first step to reducing their numbers, but it is only a step. I do doubt that Americans have the energy to actually change our society to the point I believe is necessary.\n \n However, one step is better than pushing their heads back under the water as pro-life people advocate.",

   "\n Sex education? Trying to make sure abstinence in in the curriculum isn't cutting money. That's what Bush has been trying to do.\n \n\n \n Misinformation might be a cause of more abortions.\n From the Health Forum:\n \nSome Abstinence Programs Mislead Teens, Report Says\n \n By Ceci Connolly\n Washington Post Staff Writer\n Thursday, December 2, 2004; Page A01 \n \n Many American youngsters participating in federally funded abstinence-only programs have been taught over the past three years that abortion can lead to sterility and suicide, that half the gay male teenagers in the United States have tested positive for the AIDS virus, and that touching a person's genitals \"can result in pregnancy,\" a congressional staff analysis has found. \n \n Those and other assertions are examples of the \"false, misleading, or distorted information\" in the programs' teaching materials, said the analysis, released yesterday, which reviewed the curricula of more than a dozen projects aimed at preventing teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease. \n \n \"I don't think we ought to lie to our children about science,\" said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), left, who led the congressional staff analysis. (Ray Lustig -- The Washington Post) \n \n In providing nearly $170 million next year to fund groups that teach abstinence only, the Bush administration, with backing from the Republican Congress, is investing heavily in a just-say-no strategy for teenagers and sex. But youngsters taking the courses frequently receive medically inaccurate or misleading information, often in direct contradiction to the findings of government scientists, said the report, by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), a critic of the administration who has long argued for comprehensive sex education. \n \n Several million children ages 9 to 18 have participated in the more than 100 federal abstinence programs since the efforts began in 1999. Waxman's staff reviewed the 13 most commonly used curricula -- those used by at least five programs apiece. \n \n The report concluded that two of the curricula were accurate but the 11 others, used by 69 organizations in 25 states, contain unproved claims, subjective conclusions or outright falsehoods regarding reproductive health, gender traits and when life begins. In some cases, Waxman said in an interview, the factual issues were limited to occasional misinterpretations of publicly available data; in others, the materials pervasively presented subjective opinions as scientific fact. \n \n Among the misconceptions cited by Waxman's investigators: \n \n \u0095 A 43-day-old fetus is a \"thinking person.\" \n \n \u0095 HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, can be spread via sweat and tears. \n \n \u0095 Condoms fail to prevent HIV transmission as often as 31 percent of the time in heterosexual intercourse. \n \n One curriculum, called \"Me, My World, My Future,\" teaches that women who have an abortion \"are more prone to suicide\" and that as many as 10 percent of them become sterile. This contradicts the 2001 edition of a standard obstetrics textbook that says fertility is not affected by elective abortion, the Waxman report said. \n \n \"I have no objection talking about abstinence as a surefire way to prevent unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases,\" Waxman said. \"I don't think we ought to lie to our children about science. Something is seriously wrong when federal tax dollars are being used to mislead kids about basic health facts.\" \n \n When used properly and consistently, condoms fail to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) less than 3 percent of the time, federal researchers say, and it is not known how many gay teenagers are HIV-positive. The assertion regarding gay teenagers may be a misinterpretation of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found that 59 percent of HIV-infected males ages 13 to 19 contracted the virus through homosexual relations. \n \n \"I don't think we ought to lie to our children about science,\" said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), left, who led the congressional staff analysis. (Ray Lustig -- The Washington Post) \n \n Joe. S. McIlhaney Jr., who runs the Medical Institute for Sexual Health, which developed much of the material that was surveyed, said he is \"saddened\" that Waxman chose to \"blast\" well-intentioned abstinence educators when there is much the two sides could agree on. \n \n McIlhaney acknowledged that his group, which publishes \"Sexual Health Today\" instruction manuals, made a mistake in describing the relationship between a rare type of infection caused by chlamydia bacteria and heart failure. Chlamydia also causes a common type of sexually transmitted infection, but that is not linked to heart disease. But McIlhaney said Waxman misinterpreted a slide that warns young people about the possibility of pregnancy without intercourse. McIlhaney said the slide accurately describes a real, though small, risk of pregnancy in mutual masturbation. \n \n Congress first allocated money for abstinence-only programs in 1999, setting aside $80 million in grants, which go to a variety of religious, civic and medical organizations. To be eligible, groups must limit discussion of contraception to failure rates. \n \n President Bush has enthusiastically backed the movement, proposing to spend $270 million on abstinence projects in 2005. Congress reduced that to about $168 million, bringing total abstinence funding to nearly $900 million over five years. It does not appear that the abstinence-only curricula are being taught in the Washington area. \n \n Waxman and other liberal sex-education proponents argue that adolescents who take abstinence-only programs are ill-equipped to protect themselves if they become sexually active. According to the latest CDC data, 61 percent of graduating high school seniors have had sex. \n \n Supporters of the abstinence approach, also called abstinence until marriage, counter that teaching young people about \"safer sex\" is an invitation to have sex. \n \n Alma Golden, deputy assistant secretary for population affairs in the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement that Waxman's report is a political document that does a \"disservice to our children.\" Speaking as a pediatrician, Golden said, she knows \"abstaining from sex is the most effective means of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV, STDs and preventing pregnancy.\" \n \n Nonpartisan researchers have been unable to document measurable benefits of the abstinence-only model. Columbia University researchers found that although teenagers who take \"virginity pledges\" may wait longer to initiate sexual activity, 88 percent eventually have premarital sex. \n \n Bill Smith, vice president of public policy at the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, a comprehensive sex education group that also receives federal funding, said the Waxman report underscored the need for closer monitoring of what he called the \"shame-based, fear-based, medically inaccurate messages\" being disseminated with tax money. He said the danger of abstinence education lies in the omission of useful medical information. \n \n Some course materials cited in Waxman's report present as scientific fact notions about a man's need for \"admiration\" and \"sexual fulfillment\" compared with a woman's need for \"financial support.\" One book in the \"Choosing Best\" series tells the story of a knight who married a village maiden instead of the princess because the princess offered so many tips on slaying the local dragon. \"Moral of the story,\" notes the popular text: \"Occasional suggestions and assistance may be alright, but too much of it will lessen a man's confidence or even turn him away from his princess.\" \n",

   "\n There is no way to link higher or lower abortion directly to the president. There are a plethora of reasons why it could be higher right now.\n\n \n Certainly having this president couldn't be helping.\n \n From here \n \nThe state with the lowest divorce rate in the nation is Massachusetts. At latest count it had a divorce rate of 2.4 per 1,000 population, while the rate for Texas was 4.1.\n ...\n Education. Massachusetts has about the highest rate of education in the country, with 85 percent completing high school. For Texas the rate is 76 percent. One third of Massachusetts residents have completed college, compared with 23 percent of Texans, and the other Northeast states are right behind Massachusetts.\n \n\n \n From here \n \nExperts cite low household incomes (Oklahoma ranks 46th and Arkansas 47th), and a tendency for couples to marry at a younger age than in many other states. \n\n \n \n On abortion directly, the news is not good under Bush either.\n Here is a link to a image of teen pregnancies between red and blue states.\n \n From here \n \nAbortion was decreasing. When President Bush took office, the nation's abortion rates were at a 24-year low, after a 17.4% decline during the 1990s. This was an average decrease of 1.7% per year, mostly during the latter part of the decade. (This data comes from Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life using the Guttmacher Institute's studies). \n \n Enter George W. Bush in 2001. One would expect the abortion rate to continue its consistent course downward, if not plunge. Instead, the opposite happened. \n \n I found three states that have posted multi-year statistics through 2003, and abortion rates have risen in all three: Kentucky's increased by 3.2% from 2000 to 2003.
