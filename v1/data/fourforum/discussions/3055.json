   "Greetings:\n \n Debating the pros and cons of homosexuality in our society has led me to look below the surface of things a little bit. It occurred to me that the whole concept of 'same sex' copulation is an errant man-made concoction. To support my feeling, I headed out to an online dictionary and looked up the word sex. Here is there result:\n \n http://www.m-w.com/\n \n \nSex:\n \n 1 : either of the two major forms of individuals that occur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as female or male\n 2 : the sum of the structural, functional, and behavioral characteristics of living things that are involved in reproduction by two interacting parents  and that distinguish males and females\n 3 a : sexually motivated phenomena or behavior \n \n \n Guess what boys and girls? Sex has to do with reproduction of the species. HomoSEXUAL behavior has nothing at all to do with reproduction! emoticon_xdonno \n \n Therefore, gay folks need to come up with a word that really describes their behavior. Do we have any suggestions?\n \n Just incredible,\n \n Terral",

Therefore, the term Homosexual has been created upon the false premise that gays reproduce. This just goes to show that even the word itself is a freak of etymology.

Unfortunately you only helped make my point. What you have done is defined an alternate phrase in place of the word in question. \n \n The common trait of heterosexual, homosexual and asexual is sexual. The root in question is the term \"sex.\" Your definition is for the phrase \"Human Sexual Behavior.\" Do the three words in question, and particularly the word 'Homosexual,' contain the phrase \"Human Sexual Behavior?\" No. Does my original post include that phrase? No. So you have defined something that has no relevance to my original post. Let's go to your website and look up the word 'sex.'\n \n \nSex\n \n Alternate meaning: Human sexuality, in particular sexual intercourse \n \n The members of many species of living things are divided into two or more categories called sexes. These categories refer to complementary groups that combine genetic material in order to reproduce. This process is called sexual reproduction. Typically, a species will have two sexes: male and female The female sex is defined as the one that produces the larger gamete (i.e., reproductive cell). The categories of sex are, therefore, descriptive of the reproductive functions that an individual is capable of performing at sometime in its life cycle. \n \n The word sex is also used as an abbreviation to refer to sexual intercourse (the physical acts related to sexual reproduction) and other human sexual behavior, but this article will discuss the concept of sex defined above. \n \n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 Now, if we can get past 'My Wife And I' definition aspects of 'heterosexual' behavior (this post is about the word \"Homosexual\" look at the Topic Section Heading) . . . This is not a theology class, it is about grammar. \n \n \n \nJake << Then you are saying that anything heterosexuals do that does not lead to reproduction isn't sex.\n \n \n Nice try. No. Please clarify your statement using positive terms (remove the nots). In real life, people are male or female. Are we noticing that fact in the definition above? Were the authors of these terms required to use the term heterosexual in the definition? No. \n \n A person is not male or female based upon their preferences or choices about behaviors. We are born with the genetically coded material that makes us male or female. Every professing 'Homosexual' is really a male or female either able or unable to copulate with a person of the opposite sex and reproduce genetic copies. Calling yourself a homosexual does not change the fact that inside you are physically, chemically and anatomically a heterosexual male or female. Here is a news flash for many . . . let's look up the word 'heterosexual.'\n \n \nHeterosexual : adj : sexually attracted to members of the opposite sex [ant: homosexual, bisexual] (noun)\n \n 1: a heterosexual person; someone having a sexual orientation to persons of the opposite sex [syn: heterosexual person, straight person, straight] \n \n \n Everyone keeps talking about a 'heterosexuals,' but the word in your dictionary is an adjective. Adjectives describe what? Nouns. Therefore, the example is followed by the neutral noun 'person.' But again, in the real world, every person is either a male or female. Those terms define the 'sex' of the person, and that identification is based upon the ability to reproduce. This brings us back around to the fact that gay folks do not reproduce. So classifying, labeling or identifying this group using a word containing the word 'sex' is inaccurate; thus \"The Fallacy of Homosexuality\". \n \n \nJake << We'd have to develop different words for those activities. There would be a lot of sexual virgins out there, who had been intimate with someone else.\n\n \n We are not describing activities. Is Homosexual an activity? No. It is an adjective that describes something. Okay, take your pick. Male or female? Again, the word male or female accurately describe the sexes of our species. It is NOT about behavior. That is the propaganda of the homosexual males and females out there seeking to justify deviant behavior! These terms describe people by their ability to reproduce (create copies through combining genetic material), because they contain 'sex' as part of the word. Again, people do not change their sex by altering their behavior. Calling people 'homosexuals,' because they prefer copulation with people of the same sex is totally against the rules of everyday common English. \n \n GL,\n \n Terral",

You can believe that all you want.\n \n What this entire forum topic is supposed to be about is civil rights concerning gays.\n Terral03 had said on several occassions that he/she doesn't see what rights gays are being denied. That gays have the exact same rights as anyone else to marry, as long as they marry someone of the opposite gender. \n This is illogical in that heterosexuals are not only legally \"allowed\" to marry others of the opposite gender, it's quite convenient in that they are actually attracted to members of the opposite gender.\n Gays, in contrast, are not attracted to members of the opposite gender. Saying they are \"allowed\" to marry is assuming they would ever be attracted to members of the opposite gender. \n \n Would two members of the same gender, who are sexually active homosexuals be harming anyone else in their \"marriage?\" \n Do two members of the same gender marrying each other in anyway threaten those married couples who are comprised of one of each gender? \n \n Sin or not, it's still not enough to deny Civil Rights to one specific group of people based on one religion's views of those people or their activities.\n \n Not all religions are against homosexuals, homosexual acts or homosexual marraiges. \n \n To force a law which is comprised of one religions views is equal to promoting of said religion by the governement. \n This is in direct conflict with our First Amendment rights as citizens. \n \n No Atheist is ever denied a marriage license. They are not forced to hold a religious wedding cerimony of any kind. No one is.\n Therefore our Civil Rights as far as marraige do NOT prescribe to any religion let alone any specific religious views.\n \n The reason I have put Terral03 on ignor is because I have posted a short list of several rights of which gays are being denied through the denial of legalized marriage. Rights which are \"Assumed\" to all legally married, opposite gender, couples...yet Terral03 as ignored such post.\n Insted opting to spout Bible verses at me and accuse me of \"playing house\" with my \"girlfriend\" and that I am acting irresponcibly because I don't have any children to which I must set an example for.\n To which I have corrected his/her assumption of my not being a mother.

Further to that, most Christians don't seem to worry about the 'sexual deviance' of heterosexuals viz. adultery, pornography etc.\n In sociological terms, there's a difference between sex and gender.

A heterosexual is \"really a male or female either able or unable to copulate witha person of the opposite sex and reproduce genetic copies. \n \n \n No. A heterosexual is not anything. A heterosexual male or female is one of the opposite sexes of our species. \n \n \nMontalban doing his parrot act << Calling yourself (heterosexual) does not change the fact that inside you are physically, chemically and anatomically a heterosexual male or female\"\n\n \n Calling yourself the man in the moon does not change your sexuality within the species. Those terms are defined by our ability to reproduce; by the sex cells and encoded dna in our physical bodies. A male has one set of cells, and the female has the other set. The term heterosexual accurately describes all male and female members of our species. The 'sex' part of that word appears there, because of our ability to reproduce. It is not about choosing to be heterosexual, or wanting to be with a member of the opposite sex. \n \n \nMontalban building straw horses << Further to this, your fallacy is that you believe a male is 'heterosexual' in an intrinsic sense. Just stating this does not make it so. Your whole argument rests on this 'just-so' belief.\n \n \n No. My whole argument does not rest upon any one thing. We are simply defining terms here; terms that contain the word 'sex' in them. My post does not contain the words 'intrinsic' or 'just-so' belief. Those are terms you brought in to cloud the discussion. \n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << Everyone keeps talking about \"heterosexuals,\" but the word in your dictionary is an adjective. Adjectives describe what? Nouns. Therefore, the example is followed by the neutral noun 'person.' But again, in the real world, every person is either a male or female. Those terms define the 'sex' of the person, and that identification is based upon the ability to reproduce. This brings us back around to the fact that gay folks do not reproduce. So classifying, labelling or identifying this group using a word containing the word ?sex? is inaccurate; thus ?The Fallacy of Homosexuality?. \n \n \n \nMontalban again doing the parrot act << because heterosexual is also 'an adjective'. \n \n \n Yes, Montalban, the how about that? And by repeating my exact words, you prove what? I say, \"Everyone keeps talking about a \"heterosexuals,\" but the word in your dictionary is an adjective.\" And you say, \"because heterosexual is also 'an adjective'. ????????????

That's why I keep saying DO NOT HELP ME. \n \n Did you make any attempt to address the male/female aspects of the dictionary definition? No. Why not? That is the main point supporting my case! That point alone is why \"sex\" does not belong in 'homosexual.' If you do not get it, then please stand on the sidelines.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << We are not describing activities. Is Homosexual an activity? No. It is an adjective that describes something. Okay, take your pick. Male or female? Again, the word male or female accurately describe the sexes of our species. It is NOT about behaviour. That is the propaganda of the homosexual males and females out there seeking to justify deviant behaviour! These terms describe people by their ability to reproduce (create copies through combining genetic material), because they contain 'sex' as part of the word. Again, people do not change their sex by altering their behaviour. Calling people 'homosexuals,' because they prefer copulation with people of the same sex is totally against the rules of everyday common English.\n \n \n \n \nMontalban << If a male is not about 'activity' then you cannot say that being a male is intrinsically either homosexual or heterosexual, hence your just-so statement is now contradicted by yourself.\n\n \n Who is saying what 'male is not?' And what is with all these double negative statements? Jack was doing the same thing. Look at all the information you cut and pasted above? You challenge all of that to talk about 'male is not activity?' There is nothing contradictory about 'male and female' and the definition of 'sex,' and how that is part of 'heterosexual,' and how that word describes everyone. \n \n You want to talk about the term 'male' and how it applies to this discussion? Or are you here to muddy the water for the gay folks? Because that is all you are doing. Come out here and make a statement that makes some sense. Not this, \"You can't say, can say intrinsically balony.\" \n \n Here is the definition of the primary root word again:\n \n \nSex\n \n Alternate meaning: Human sexuality, in particular sexual intercourse \n \n The members of many species of living things are divided into two or more categories called sexes. These categories refer to complementary groups that combine genetic material in order to reproduce. This process is called sexual reproduction. Typically, a species will have two sexes: male and female The female sex is defined as the one that produces the larger gamete (i.e., reproductive cell). The categories of sex are, therefore, descriptive of the reproductive functions that an individual is capable of performing at sometime in its life cycle\n.\n \n Now, do you recognize the term 'male' in the definition? That represents one of the two sexes. Every person is born either male or female and with the genetic ability to reproduce. Everyone is born from heterosexual parents, right? \n \n Note carefully that \"The female SEX is DEFINED as the one that produces the larger gamete.\" Are you with me so far? . . . Now take this definition back to the word 'heterosexual.' \n \n Do you see the word 'sex' in the word? Yes, I hope. Okay. This word can be accurately applied to either male or female  to describe every living person on this planet. Why? Again, it has to do with their 'ability' to duplicate themselves genetically. \n \n Every single person living today is heterosexual by definition of the terms. Nobody changes his genetic capability by choosing deviant behaviors. What we do or say does not change our sexuality. This is not about choice! \n \n This whole 'homosexual' discussion is over a myth. Homosexual people do not really exist, except in their own minds. They are really and truly all heterosexual males and females who use these terms and phrases to justify deviant same sex copulation.\n \n Montalban << If you could present an argument that does a) make sense and b) doesn't contradict itself it would be a real boon\n \n Here is the reality of learning, Montalban. It is a truth that I picked up from Dale Carnegie Training in my youth. When presenting information to the public, about 10 percent will get it the first time without further instruction. Another 60 percent can be trained with a reasonable amount of teaching. However, for most situations there are about 30 to 35 percent that will never get it no matter how long you try to instruct them. And quite frankly, there are not enough days remaining for me to wait around for you to get what I am saying. \n \n You want to debate? Nobody has replied to this post since June.

Here your theory is that there's something really significant about one of these words being an adjective - to describe something, yet the other's an adjective too.\n \nDid you make any attempt to address the male/female aspects of the dictionary definition? No. Why not? That is the main point supporting my case! That point alone is why ?sex? does not belong in ?homosexual.? If you do not get it, then please stand on the sidelines.\n\n As shown, sex is not just about reproduction.\n \nWe are not describing activities. Is Homosexual an activity? No. It is an adjective that describes something. Okay, take your pick. Male or female? Again, the word male or female accurately describe the sexes of our species. It is NOT about behaviour. That is the propaganda of the homosexual males and females out there seeking to justify deviant behaviour! These terms describe people by their ability to reproduce (create copies through combining genetic material), because they contain ?sex? as part of the word. Again, people do not change their sex by altering their behaviour. Calling people ?homosexuals,? because they prefer copulation with people of the same sex is totally against the rules of everyday common English. \n\n Do you have friends? You obviously don't believe me. Why don't you run this theory of yours by them... hopefully one of them speaks English.\n \nIf a male is not about 'activity' then you cannot say that being a male is intrinsically either homosexual or heterosexual, hence your just-so statement is now contradicted by yourself. \n\n \nWho is saying what ?male is not??And what is with all these double negative statements? Jack was doing the same thing. Look at all the information you cut and pasted above? You challenge all of that to talk about 'male is not activity?' There is nothing contradictory about 'male and female' and the definition of 'sex,' and how that is part of 'heterosexual,' and how that word describes everyone. \n\n I'm trying to suggest that have male sexual organs doesn't define one's sexual activity. A dead man still has male genitals, but he is asexual.\n \nYou want to talk about the term ?male? and how it applies to this discussion? Or are you here to muddy the water for the gay folks? Because that is all you are doing. Come out here and make a statement that makes some sense. Not this, ?You can?t say, can say intrinsically balony.(sic) ? \n\n This is getting weird, I feel like I've entered another dimension.\n \nHere is the definition of the primary root word again:\n Quote:\n Sex\n Alternate meaning: Human sexuality, in particular sexual intercourse \n The members of many species of living things are divided into two or more categories called sexes. These categories refer to complementary groups that combine genetic material in order to reproduce. This process is called sexual reproduction. Typically, a species will have two sexes: male and female The female sex is defined as the one that produces the larger gamete (i.e., reproductive cell). The categories of sex are, therefore, descriptive of the reproductive functions that an individual is capable of performing at sometime in its life cycle \n Now, do you recognize the term ?male? in the definition? That represents one of the two sexes. Every person is born either male or female and with the genetic ability to reproduce. Everyone is born from heterosexual parents, right? \n\n Well, you've edited out the sentence that puts the nail in the coffin, so it means you actually do recognise it. I thought you'd just missed it.\n Your own site says...\n \"The word sex is also used as an abbreviation to refer to sexual intercourse (the physical acts related to sexual reproduction) and other human sexual behaviour, but this article will discuss the concept of sex defined above.\"\n http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Sex\n It deals mainly with reproduction, because that's the type of site you chose.\n \n Note carefully that ?The female SEX is DEFINED as the one that produces the larger gamete.? Are you with me so far? . . . Now take this definition back to the word ?heterosexual.?\n\n Yes, producing a female gamete is what a healthy female does. Does this make her heterosexual? No. She need not be sexually active at all either.\n \nDo you see the word ?sex? in the word? Yes, I hope. Okay. This word can be accurately applied to either male or female to describe every living person on this planet. Why? Again, it has to do with their ?ability? to duplicate themselves genetically. \n\n Having the ability to duplicate yourself, you'd have been involved in cloning. I don't know what cloning has to do with this. However, having the ability to have sex does not mean that you are heterosexual. You still mix up the gender with the act.\n \nEvery single person living today is heterosexual by definition of the terms. Nobody changes his genetic capability by choosing deviant behaviours. What we do or say does not change our sexuality. This is not about choice! \n\n IF everyone is heterosexual, and it's not about 'choice' then how are the homosexuals? How are they both unable to choose, and made non-homosexual?\n \nThis whole ?homosexual? discussion is over a myth. Homosexual people do not really exist, except in their own minds. They are really and truly all heterosexual males and females who use these terms and phrases to justify deviant same sex copulation.\n\n You've still painted yourself into a corner by denying both choice, and a physical cause.\n \nIf you could present an argument that does a) make sense and b) doesn't contradict itself it would be a real boon\n\n \nHere is the reality of learning, Montalban. It is a truth that I picked up from Dale Carnegie Training in my youth.\n\n So you didn't attend the McHamburger university then?\n \n When presenting information to the public, about 10 percent will get it the first time without further instruction. Another 60 percent can be trained with a reasonable amount of teaching. However, for most situations there are about 30 to 35 percent that will never get it no matter how long you try to instruct them. And quite frankly, there are not enough days remaining for me to wait around for you to get what I am saying.\n\n Ouch! I suppose if you shut off parts of your own citations, confuse sex the attributes with sexual behaviour, and then toss it up in the air, you might well make sense to someone.\n \nYou want to debate?\n\n Yes, I made that invitation.\n \nNobody has replied to this post since June. If my ability to present a case is so weak, then head over and tear me a new one.\n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2506\n This has also received zero replies.\n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2505\n Maximus and I debated on these two, before he ran out of steam.\n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2509\n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2556\n GL,\n Terral\n\n I'm not surprised he gave up, you're like the black hole of debating.",

   "Hi Maxwell:\n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << Guess what boys and girls? Sex has to do with reproduction of the species.\n \n \n \nMaxwell's voice of reason << From a purely biology standpoint, you would be correct. However, if you think that is the true point in a relationship or a society, you're gravely mistaken. \n \n \n This thread concerns itself with the 'Fallacy of Homosexuality.' I am specifically directing attention to the presence of the root word 'sex' in that word, and that word only. Then, I am drawing comparisons to the incorrect use of this one word \"Homosexuality,\" by standing it beside the two other terms \"Heterosexual\" and \"Asexual.\" Two of those three terms accurately contain the root word 'sex,' because they describe different species by the way they reproduce. However, one of these three terms breaks all the rules of etymology. Can you lend assistance if picking out which one? \n \n \nTerral original << Therefore, gay folks need to come up with a word that really describes their behavior.\n \n \n \nMaxwell << Intimate relationships with members of the same sex. Joe's word is sufficent. \n \n \n Bulla the Buzzer sounds! We are searching for one word Max, not a phrase. Remember the name of the thread \"The Fallacy of Homosexuality.\" We are still looking for 'a word' that really describes their behavior; and specifially an adjective to describe each sex of our species. The root 'sex' does not belong in the word, because Gay people do not reproduce in nature. \n \n \nTerral original << Two of those words accurately contain the word 'sex,' because they signify means of reproduction.\n \n \n \nMaxwell << Then how about cloning? invitro? Artificial insemation? None of that involves sex yet is all signifies reproduction. \n \n \n Holy Mollies . . . Hello! emoticon_xbye Again, this thread is about the Fallacy of Homosexuality and how THAT WORD compares to Heterosexual and Asexual. We are looking specifically at the root 'sex,' and how that word accurately describes only two  of our candidates. Species on this planet are defined and categorized by the way they reproduce IN NATURE. \n \n \nTerral Original << This is not a theology class, it is about grammar.\n \n \n \nMaxwell << Then you have just admmited to slumping into the bed of grammar attacks, swearing and calling your opponent's mothers sexual service \n \n \n Thank you very much for entering this debate on the side of the gay folks. Grammar, Max. \n \n \nTerral Original << If either of you are up to the challenge of engaging me in meaningful debate providers.\n \n \n \nMaxwell << A meaningful debate is devoid of attacked based purely on semantics and grammar, something you admitted as the point of the thread.\n\n \n Surely you jest. Who is attacking anything or anyone? This is a word study on the term 'homosexual,' and how that word breaks the rules of grammar. I am the one to keep saying that this is not about choice or behavior. Everyone reading these words is either a male or female  and the product of heterosexual reproduction. They are indeed genetic dna copies of their heterosexual parents. \n \n Suppose Justine or Lady decides to start a family. Does that decision change their sexuality? No. They both are already genetically capable of commingling their dna with a 'male' of our species to reproduce copies of themselves. They are both already heterosexual by definition of the term. THAT is why the root word 'sex' appears in the word! Heterosexual females ALWAYS give birth to either a male or female. Those are the ONLY two sexes in our species. Each carries the coded dna material to reproduce themselves. Now, you can claim all day long that I am attacking someone, but this thread is still about the primary 'terms' in the debate. \n \n \nMaxwell << But while we're on the topic, I'll check webster for another definition.\n\n \n Another definition is not going to nullify one shred of the coded dna material contained within every cell of every male and female of our species. Someone else's definition is not going to change the rules of etymology that govern words and their origins. It is a simple fact that some words break the rules. Homosexual is one of those exceptions.\n \n \nMaxwell's definition of Sex << Main Entry: 1sex Pronunciation: 'seks, Function: noun\n Etymology: Middle English, from Latin sexus\n 1 : either of the two major forms of individuals that occur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as female or male \n \n \n Nothing new here; male and female are the only two sexes of our species.\n \n \nMaxwell << Homo comes from the root hom.\n\n \n The term 'homo' is not part of this discussion. All the prefixes of 'hetero,' 'homo,' and 'A' appear before 'sexual.' The root of all these words is from your defined word above, which is 'sex.' I accept your very much shortened definition of 'sex,' but that changes nothing about my original post.\n \n \nMaxwell << So what's the point of arguing this?\n\n \n You are the one presenting the opposing views to my original post, which shows the Fallacy of Homosexuality. Are we clear on the term fallacy? Misleading notion, erroneous belief, myth? \n \n People keep telling me that being gay is 'in your head.' And you know what? I am inclined to believe it. \n \n Terral",

   "Hi Montalban:\n \n \nOriginally Posted by Terral03 << Very good. I do not want you on my side of this or any discussion. Please side with Justine, Lady, Jack and whoever else they can muster, or present your own case for the 'topic' on this thread. \n \n \n \nMontalbans reply << I have done this - that is, state my case. I do believe that homosexuality is a sin, as given in 1 Corinthians, and by Holy Tradition. However, your case is that there's some kind of essentialist nature to being male, and to being female. \n \n \n \"Essentialist Nature\"? Our species has exactly two sexes, Montalban. Everyone here is a heterosexual genetic reproduction of a male or female. Everyone here has heterosexual parents. The word 'sex' appears in the word for a good reason. Please save your 'essentialist nature' balony for someone else.\n \n BTW, please provide your expert commentary on these words from Romans 1.\n \n \n\"For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper.\" Rom. 1:26-28.\n\n \n And this bit:\n \n \n\"and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.\" Rom. 1:32.\n\n \n \nMontalban << I also believe in 'Free Will' and your essentialist argument denies this. \n \n \n You can believe in the tooth fairy. Free will does not change the manner in which each member of our species is classified. Nobody has the free will to change the way they were born. By definition of the terms, nobody has ever been born GAY. That is a myth. And, my presentation is over the 'terms' of the discussion; about grammar. Choice has nothing to do with it.\n \n \nMontalban << Further to that, most Christians don't seem to worry about the 'sexual deviance' of heterosexuals viz. adultery, pornography etc.\n\n \n The cares and whims of professing Christians has nothing to do with this discussion. Please feel free to start your own thread, and describe these 'sexual deviance' views to your hearts content.\n \n \nMontalban << In sociological terms, there's a difference between sex and gender. Sex being the actual physical traits. Gender being the qualities we assign to people based on sex. \n \n \n Just how does this apply to one thing presented in my original post? Nobody assigns qualities of sex to anyone, except heterosexual parents to their own children. Please get back to the grammar aspect of this debate and present opposing views for WHAT I DID PRESENT; not these fairy tales. The root word 'sex' does not belong in any adjective that describes any Gay male or female on this planet. All males and females are heterosexual by definition. 'Sex' is the root of the word, because of the dna qualities contained in their ability to reproduce. \n \n The term 'homosexual' cannot accurately be applied to any gay male or female. It is an incorrect use of the English language, because gay people do not reproduce in nature. The term 'homosexual' is a mythical invention, whether you wish to believe it or not. Therefore, in reality, every gay person is actually a heterosexual male or female.\n \n \nMontalban << You seem to believe that people have particular traits, and that these are heterosexual, even when people are homosexual. Your argument is therefore very confused. \n \n \n My belief of the facts changes nothing about the dna makeup of every male and female on this planet. Those two groups of our species are called 'sexes,' because of their inherent ability to reproduce. Whether the species is heterosexual (like human beings) or Asexual, the root of the word (sex) describes that organism's ability to reproduce genetic duplicates. Our decisions about copulation with males or females does not change our 'sex.' \n \n \nMontalban << Yes and note there it says... \"The word sex is also used as an abbreviation to refer to sexual intercourse (the physical acts related to sexual reproduction) and other human sexual behavior, but this article will discuss the concept of sex defined above.\"\n\n \n That's right . . . 'sexual behavior.' The root of sexual is 'sex.'

One is almost miraculously teleported from one idea to the next, with no apparent thread leaving any tell-tale pathway of connection.\n\n \n Thank you Mantalban: \n I will now take your annalogy and put a biblical spin on it, just so it's amplified enough so that Terral03 might be able to understand the implications of which he has actually brought to the table. \n \n (Leviticus 18:22 NKJV) 'You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination.'\n \n But, according to Terral03 it is impossible for two men to do so, this makes the entire idea of any kind of sin meaningless and false.\n Here's another to read and weep. Personally my tears are from laughing too hard.\n \n (Judges 19:22-25 NRSV) While they were enjoying themselves, the men of the city, a perverse lot, surrounded the house, and started pounding on the door. They said to the old man, the master of the house, \"Bring out the man who came into your house, so that we may have intercourse with him.\"\n \n Again, since it is physically impossible for any human to do so according to Terral03, he is now not only working to destroy that on which he has hung all his beliefs. \n \n Of course I'm laughing because of the words used in this translation. There are just so many translations out there that it's amazing anyone can dare to assume they are even reading the same book, let alone the same passages, chapters or verses.",

   "Hi Montalban:\n \n Thank you very much for entering this debate on the side of the gay folks. Next, none of my words appear in your post, so you have allowed all of them to remain standing. \n \n \nMontalban << terral03, you live in your own world. You introduced a site that gave two definitions of 'sex'. One of these had to do with the act of reproduction. One did not.\n \n \n I hear your voice of concern, Montalban, but see no evidence to support your case. If you have a case, let's see it.\n \n \nMontalban << You ignore the one that did not, as it gets in the way of your highly unique but ultimately contrived idea. I've pointed this out, but you just plough ahead as if it doesn't exist... a remarkable feat of perseverance and loyalty to an idea despite the evidences. So for you the act of sex is solely about reproduction.\n\n \n No sir. Absolutely nothing in my definitions pertain to the 'act of sex.' The definition is about 'characteristics' of our species. Please try again. Again, it would help if you highlight my errors and give us your commentary. This post of yours is all opinion about what you perceive as errant statements. \n \n \nMontalban << If sex is just about copulation, then two homosexuals having intercourse aren't having sex (by your definition), and as they're not copulating/they aren't committing an act of reproduction.\n \n \n Again, my post is not about copulation or any act. This is an exercise in grammar and specifically the comparison of there words that all contain the same root; sex. Heterosexual, Asexual and Homosexual. \n \n \nMontalban << Then, and this is part of the joy of your theory, is that they are in fact they not committing a sin. For it is the 'act of sex' that most Christians who condemn homosexuality use as the measure.\n \n \n This is not a lesson in theology, Montalban. My purpose on this thread is not to judge anybody. This is entirely about grammar, definition of common roots, and any reasonable deductions we might derive from the comparisons. Therefore, your concerns are over assumptions you have created in your own mind. Perhaps that is why you did not bother to include a single word of my post in your presentation. \n \n \nMontalban << And you're arguing that they're not having sex, because sex is only about reproduction. \n \n \n No. This is not about behavior, acts or choices; depravity or judgment. Again, it is a comparative word study on just three (count them) words in your English Dictionary that all contain the root 'sex.' You can join in the emotional antics of the gay folks if you like. Please do . . . \n \n \nMontalban << They are in fact, by your 'theory' committing an act that is covered by no terminology. So, as I stated, you give conservative Christians a bad name. \n \n \n That is a conclusion you have drawn from your assumptions. Please 'cut and paste' my words stating those things as fact. And, everyone saying, \"Lord, Lord\" is not a member of the body of Christ. So, like I said, you are in good company. You enlisted on the right team. Send off for the hat and tee-shirt. \n \n \nMontalban << How is it a sin to be a homosexual if you've removed everything about the act and then introducing the 'idea' that all homosexuals are in fact heterosexuals, there-by, at least in implication making any claim that homosexuality is a sin tantamount to saying heterosexuality is a sin; as you equate the two.\n\n \n The fact that homosexual males and females are worthy of death is part of New Testament Scripture. Every God-fearing Christian can make their own determinations about the pros and cons of Homosexual behavior from God's Word. Again, this thread is not dedicated to 'hell fire and brimstone.' This is about definition of terms. If I must post the verses again, then here you go:\n \n \"Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them. For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts  and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper . . . and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.\" Rom. 1:24-32.\n \n \nMontalban << Further to that, you introduce the 'no choice' idea. Not only do you say a homosexual is not a homosexual by biology, but they aren't by choice. \n \n \n Really? This is what I really said,\n \n \nTerral Original << Every single person living today is heterosexual by definition of the terms. Nobody changes his genetic capability  by choosing deviant behaviors. What we do or say does not change our sexuality. This is not about choice!\n\n \n People choose to be gay every day, Montalban. Sexuality is determined in the womb, and encoded genetic DNA is woven together inside each cell. The child leaves the womb either a heterosexual male or a heterosexual female. Since every person on this planet is the product of heterosexual parents, and by DEFINITION reproduce genetic duplicates of themselves, then every person ever born is either a heterosexual male or a heterosexual female. They 'can' choose to be gay, but 'cannot' choose their sexuality! This is not about behavior or choice, because the definitions of 'species, parents, male, female' are about 'characteristics' of our species. \n \n \nMontalban << What 'thing' makes them homosexual? You've ruled out the actual 'deed', the idea of a 'choice', and any argument from biology. What is left?\n\n \n No. That is your assumption playing tricks in your mind. Many of them tell me that \"Being gay is in your mind.\" I believe them.\n \n \nMontalban << You're truly a unique mind on issues. I get a great joy out of reading all of your posts. Especially fascinating is following the sinuous path of your logic as it moves from point to point, without being hampered by the constraints of logic.\n\n \n Then logically cut and paste any errors you see in my posts and present us with your thoughtful reply. Remember that God's ways are not man's ways. So, human logic sometimes does not play a role.\n \n \nMontalban << Often this trek is even more fascinating by the apparent lack of connection between these points. One is almost miraculously teleported from one idea to the next, with no apparent thread leaving any tell-tale pathway of connection.\n\n \n That happens to folks who do not get the message. For example: Our gospel is plainly written upon the pages of your Bible, right? How foolish it would be for our Creator to leave out something so vital and important. However, Paul writes, \n \n \n\"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, in whose case the god of this world  has blinded the minds  of the unbelieving so that they might not see  the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.\" 2Cor. 4:3+4.\n\n \n He also writes,\n \n \n\"And with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not receive  the love of the truth so as to be saved. For this reason God sends upon them a deluding influence  so that they will believe what is false, in order that they all may be judged who did not  believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness.\" 2Thes. 2:10-12.\n\n \n Even our glorious gospel, written in plain sight, is veiled to a multitude of people. So just maybe you are not supposed to see it. I am just a pawn in this game. God calls the shots. \n \n Thanks again for jumping in on the correct side of this discussion, GL with it,\n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",

(ie Uncles marrying their child nieces) \n In some cultures marriages included more than one wife.\n Even in our own nation, there was a time when the Mormons were allowed to continue their \"traditional\" definition of marriage, in that a man could have more than one wife.\n Still a woman was thought of to be the personal private property of the man.\n Later on down the line, marriages became equal for both the man and the woman when divorces were not only legal but easily obtained by either partner.

We have been together longer than any of my ex-spouses relationships. He is on his fourth marriage. His track record speaks none to highly about your \"Traditional\" marriages.",

   "What desperate :xcensored are you trying to shovel now, Jaaaman?\n \n So what, if Joe's current relationship has lasted 3 years. Joe doesn't have anything to prove to you. Do heterosexuals generally marry the first person they have a relationship with, and stay with that person for the rest of their lives? No, they do not.\n \n \n Do you think people would be pushing for recognition and rights regarding their relationships, if they were not interested in long-term, meaningful relationships with one person?\n \n No long term relationships? Then why are they building retirement communities catering to old gay couples? How do you explain the first gay couple married in San Francisco were two women who had been together for 51 years?\n\n \n Actually, My relationship has lasted for 4 years. Yes I had relationships before that I dated a few different people, so do most heterosexuals!\n \n But to answer to Jaaman, Most of our friends are other couples.\n \n Kathy and Bea - 13 years\n Danny and his partner - 30 years ( just adopted a son)\n Carol and Anne - 14 years\n \n There are lots and lots of long term gay couples.

   "describing your 'indecent acts' (Romans 1:27). It only exists inside your 'depraved mind' (Romans 1:28). God Almighty says that folks who do these things are 'worthy of death' (Romans 1:32). \n \n Have you taken the time to read up on what God's Word has to say about homosexuals? Or is that not a part of your Selective Reading? \n \n May His hand be upon you,\n \n Terral\n\n \n Some believe in selective principles\n By John Tally\n This article appeared recently in the Austin American Statesman. \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n With publicity over gay marriages, the debate over homosexuality and the Bible once again fills the radio talk-show airwaves. \n \n Many of the hosts support gay marriages, but biblical arguments favoring the Christian fundamentalist cause go unchallenged. The debate usually goes something like this. \n \n HOST: So what's wrong with two loving, committed men or women being legally married? \n \n CALLER: The Bible says homosexuality is a sin. \n \n HOST: So you believe everything in the Bible is literally true? \n \n CALLER: Yes. \n \n HOST: Then you believe it's a sin to eat pork or shellfish, or for a man to shave his beard, and that those who work on the Sabbath should be put to death? \n \n CALLER: No, the coming of Jesus brought a New Covenant which freed us from those rules of the Old Testament. \n Score one for the fundamentalist. \n \n But with a few hours of Bible reading, the host could unmask the ever-popular New Covenant argument for what it really is: a justification for selective prejudice. \n \n HOST: But even under Christ's New Covenant, the New Testament is still the literal word of God isn't it? \n \n CALLER: Certainly. \n \n HOST: So you believe anyone who marries after divorce commits adultery (Mark 10:11); that women must remain silent, not teach, and have no authority over men (1Tim 2:11); and that slaves must obey their masters at all times (Col. 3:22). \n \n CALLER: Well . . . \n \n HOST: And if the New Covenant freed us from the regulations of the Old Testament, doesn't that do away with all three of its anti-gay passages ? \n \n CALLER: Um . . . no . . . the New Covenant primarily did away with the strict dietary and health rules, not the moral laws, of the Old Testament. \n \n HOST: So when Leviticus prescribes death for all adulterers and for all who curse their parents just before it prescribes the same penalty for any man who lies with another man, each of those moral laws applies to us today? \n \n CALLER: Well . . . I didn't say that . . . \n \n HOST: And when Deuteronomy prescribes death for nonvirgin brides shortly before it claims no homosexual shall be a son of Israel, you agree with both those moral laws? \n \n CALLER: Well, of course not . . . \n \n HOST: So you DO pick and choose which parts of the Bible to believe. \n Since fundamentalists are rarely confronted with these and other troubling Biblical passages, most sincerely think they believe every word of the Bible. \n \n When has Jerry Falwell called for the stoning for Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Pete and Gayle Wilson, and everyone else who has remarried after divorce? \n \n When has the Christian Coalition ever organized to ban women from teaching positions and from elected office? \n \n No, it's selective prejudice and old-fashioned fear of the unknown that motivates fundamentalists to target gays and lesbians. Biblical principle has nothing to do with it. Take away the phony claim to a literal view of the Bible, and the religious argument against homosexuality falls like a house of cards. \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n John Tally is a San Francisco attorney. \n \n This column was first published in the San Francisco Examiner.\n \n http://fogarty.org/tim/gay_issues/fund_arg.html",

We don't know how they feel about the autonomy Catholic school teachers and administrators enjoy, or if they would fight to protect the uniqueness of Catholic and other private schools.
