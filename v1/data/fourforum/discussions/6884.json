   "i think your question would be the same as \"how did the first religious concept start?\" at some point man was totally without religion, in an uncivilized culture, hunting and gathering, working on their hunting and gathering skills, as well as the beginnings of social skills. on a desert island with just natural resources, you'd be in the hypothetical situation that these primitive guys actually went through\n \n somewhere along the line, these men would encounter situations that would seem totally out of there control. like they might get lucky one day and bring home a big catch of fish. then a few weeks later come home empty. also, the even bigger events like weather and natural disasters that affected them would solidify the idea of \"luck\" and \"unluck\" in their minds\n \n soon, curiousity about how to take beck control of their luck would cause experimentation of sorts. like perhaps dropping some herbs in the river near where one was about to fish, a guy happened to get a good catch. as he kept trying this, he realized it caused his chances of a good catch to increase. in reality, the fish may either think the herbs were food or shelter, but the cave man would probably see this as an offering to the \"fish god\". the rest is history\n \n on a desrt island with no knowledge of civilization, you probably would go through the same process. you could either rationally realize that everything that happens has logical explanations, or more likely believe that things that are out of your control are responding to your existence and presence, controlled by some great force that you can appease by doing certain things. the things that seem to \"work\" would become rituals, and a religion would be born",

He himself explicitly asserted the necessity of faith and Baptism, and thereby affirmed at the same time the necessity of the Church which men enter through Baptism as through a door.

How bad is the example (or the likeness) of people who deny the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah. And Allah guides not the people who are Zalimun (polytheists, wrong-doers, disbelievers, etc.).\n \n 2:96 says that they are the greediest people...\n And verily, you will find them (the Jews) the greediest of mankind for life and (even greedier) than those who - ascribe partners to Allah (and do not believe in Resurrection - Magians, pagans, and idolaters, etc.). Everyone of them wishes that he could be given a life of a thousand years. But the grant of such life will not save him even a little from (due) punishment. And Allah is All-Seer of what they do.\n \n \n 2:61 says that al-lah stamped wrtechedness upon them.\n 4:61 Says that they (and Christians) believe in idols\n 5:52 they are cursed.\n \n Note: animal analogies are used a number of times\n Sabbath breakers are said to be like monkeys\n 2: 65 And indeed you knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday).

The Qu&#8217;ran makes the same distinction the Old Testament makes and condemns the sinners in the same manner.\n\n No, the Koran is quite explicit in it's villification of Jews; because you fail to realise that ALL Jews are deemed to have fallen from God's word; that's the very reason Al-lah sent Muhammed; to correct the many mistakes upheld by Jews and Christians.\n \n You thus need to understand verses such as...\n Surah Al-Baiyyinah\n Ayah [6] \n Verily, those who disbelieve (in the religion of Islam, the Qur'an and Prophet Muhammad) from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and Al-Mushrikun will abide in the Fire of Hell.

If you pretend that you are friends of Allah, to the exclusion of (all) other mankind, then long for death if you are truthful.\"\n \n Surah Al-Mujadilah\n Ayah [14] \n Have you (O Muhammad ) not seen those (hypocrites) who take for friends a people upon whom is the Wrath of Allah (i.e. Jews)? They are neither of you (Muslims) nor of them (Jews), and they swear to a lie while they know. \n \n You see, there's just so many verses against the Jews.\n \n It makes sense from an Islamic perspective. There would be no need for Muhammed's revelations had the Jews maintained a proper faith in God.\n \n They call upon 'us' (Jews and Christians) to awake to the 'new' revelations of God (or rather, the 'old' revelations that we've forgotten)...\n Surah Al-Hadid\n Ayah [28] \n O you who believe [in Musa (Moses) (i.e. Jews) and 'Iesa (Jesus) (i.e. Christians)]! Fear Allah, and believe too in His Messenger (Muhammad ), He will give you a double portion of His Mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk (straight), and He will forgive you. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. \n \n See here they're saying all Jews and Christians have to do is believe in Muhammed and his message, and al-lah will forgive; the implication here of course is that to deny al-lah's messenger (Muhammed), there will be no forgiveness\n \n Christians get a special mention just for believing in Christ...\n Surah Al-Kahf\n Ayah [4] \n And to warn those (Jews, Christians, and pagans) who say, \"Allah has begotten a son (or offspring or children).\" \n \n And speaking of Jesus, the Koran claims the Jews have insulted Mary!\n Surah An-Nisa\n Ayah [156] \n And because of their (Jews) disbelief and uttering against Maryam (Mary) a grave false charge (that she has committed illegal sexual intercourse); \n \n So, they're guilty of all manner of falsehoods.\n \n It is you, you see, who is deeply misinformed about Islam.",

For a price!\n \n A special tax is levied on dhimmi. Dhimmi used to have to wear special/distinctive clothing... much like how the Nazis made the Jews wear a Star of David.\n \n In court, the word of a Dhimmi could not be used to convict a Muslim.\n \n Dhimmi were not allowed to seek converts.\n \n Any Muslim who 'deconverted' (i.e. became Apostate), was subject to the death penalty (so naturally enough over time, there was an increase in Moslems, and a decrease in Dhimmi). Adding to this trend was the fact that a Moslem man was free to marry a Jewess, or Christian woman (but the kids would have to be raised Moslem; the dhimmi woman was not free to instruct her children in her faith). Conversely a Moslem woman was not allowed to marry a non-Moslem man.\n \n Dhimmi were not allowed to build new churches, and needed to seek special permission to repair old ones; no church could be higher than a mosque.",

I mean, to what degree? Can we do business with them still? If I'm at school, can we play basketball with them? Can we talk to them about basketball and stuff? Can we hang out with them as long as they keep their beliefs to themselves? The reason I ask is because someone I know does hang out with them in this way and it doesn't affect his beliefs, but I still tell him, \"Why don't you hang out with the muslims instead?\" He says that most or many of the Muslims drink and take drugs where they hang out and they have girlfriends and he's afraid that the sins of the Muslims will lure him, yet he's sure that the Kufr of the Kaafirs will not lure him because that's something that isn't attractive to him. So is hanging out with them, playing sports with them, and talking with them about sports considered as \"taking them as awliyaa instead of the believers\" keeping in mind that he is doing that for his own eemaan?.\n \n Answer : \n \n Praise be to Allaah. \n \n Firstly: \n \n Allaah has forbidden the believers to take the kaafireen (disbelievers) as friends, and He has issued a stern warning against doing that. \n \n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=59879&dgn=4\n \n \n \n I hope you don't simply repeat your claim that I am 'misrepresenting' the Koran, after citing Islamic expert opinion!",

   "No, the Koran is quite explicit in it's villification of Jews; because you fail to realise that ALL Jews are deemed to have fallen from God's word; that's the very reason Al-lah sent Muhammed; to correct the many mistakes upheld by Jews and Christians.\nAbsolutely, Muhammed is seen as an improvement. But the vilification is less clear.\n \n \nYou thus need to understand verses such as...\n Surah Al-Baiyyinah\n Ayah [6] \n Verily, those who disbelieve (in the religion of Islam, the Qur'an and Prophet Muhammad) from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and Al-Mushrikun will abide in the Fire of Hell. They are the worst of creatures.\n \n (Note: the insertion of comments in brackets in the above quote are given by the Islamic site I'm citing... www.quraan.com )\n \nThe important bit here is added presumably by the group you quote - 'in the religion of Islam, the Qur'an and Prophet Muhammed'. As the 'people of the Book (here read as 'scripture') are clearly not Muslims, saying 'those who disbelieve' in the Qu'ran is pointless -they all do. It seems more likely to mean the Jews and Christians who don't really believe in God - the oft-referred to hypocrites.\n \n \nThus they also make it clear in their own English translations of other verses...\n Surah Al-Ghaashiyah\n Ayah [2] \n Some faces, that Day, will be humiliated (in the Hell-fire, i.e. the faces of all disbelievers, Jews and Christians, etc.). \nAgain, all the intolerance is subjective stuff added by the group, not in the Qu'ran.\n \n \n Surah Al-Jumu'ah\n Ayah [6] \n Say (O Muhammad ): \"O you Jews! If you pretend that you are friends of Allah, to the exclusion of (all) other mankind, then long for death if you are truthful.\"\nJews don't believe all other mankind is excluded from God's love, so this is very specific arrogant Jews.\n \n \nSurah Al-Mujadilah\n Ayah [14] \n Have you (O Muhammad ) not seen those (hypocrites) who take for friends a people upon whom is the Wrath of Allah (i.e. Jews)? They are neither of you (Muslims) nor of them (Jews), and they swear to a lie while they know.\nAgain, the anti-Semitism remains in the brackets. \n \n You see, there's just so many verses against the Jews.\n \n \nIt makes sense from an Islamic perspective. There would be no need for Muhammed's revelations had the Jews maintained a proper faith in God.\n \n They call upon 'us' (Jews and Christians) to awake to the 'new' revelations of God (or rather, the 'old' revelations that we've forgotten)...\nThe Muslims did believe the newer revelation should be followed and was superior: as did the Christians with theirs.\n \nSurah Al-Hadid\n Ayah [28] \n O you who believe [in Musa (Moses) (i.e. Jews) and 'Iesa (Jesus) (i.e. Christians)]! Fear Allah, and believe too in His Messenger (Muhammad ), He will give you a double portion of His Mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk (straight), and He will forgive you. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. \n \n See here they're saying all Jews and Christians have to do is believe in Muhammed and his message, and al-lah will forgive; the implication here of course is that to deny al-lah's messenger (Muhammed), there will be no forgiveness\nThis promises bonuses for converts, not condemnations for non-converts.\n \n \nChristians get a special mention just for believing in Christ...\n Surah Al-Kahf\n Ayah [4] \n And to warn those (Jews, Christians, and pagans) who say, \"Allah has begotten a son (or offspring or children).\" \nYeah, they've got a downer on giving GOd children or equals: it's against the pure monotheism. So what?\n \n \nAnd speaking of Jesus, the Koran claims the Jews have insulted Mary!\n Surah An-Nisa\n Ayah [156] \n And because of their (Jews) disbelief and uttering against Maryam (Mary) a grave false charge (that she has committed illegal sexual intercourse); \n \n So, they're guilty of all manner of falsehoods.\n \n It is you, you see, who is deeply misinformed about Islam.\nUmm, except the Jews generally DID say this about Mary, as they didn't accept Jesus as miraculously conceived and he was illegitimate. The same 'falsehood' of the accusation of his illegitimacy is found in the Bible.",

   "Bradamante, thank you for participating in this \"discussion.\" I am also curious to know what the Koran has to say about Christians.\n\n There's some hopeful verses about Christians (and Jews)\n \n Surah Al-Baqarah Ayah [111] \n And they say, \"None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.\" These are their own desires. Say (O Muhammad Peace be upon him ), \"Produce your proof if you are truthful.\"\n \n However this is saying what Jews and Christians say about Jews and Christians ;)\n But then within the same Surah...\n Surah Al-Baqarah\n Ayah [113] \n The Jews said that the Christians follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); and the Christians said that the Jews follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); though they both recite the Scripture. Like unto their word, said (the pagans) who know not. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they have been differing.\n \n Again they recognise Christians have 'failed' in understanding the message of God...\n Surah Al-'Imran\n Ayah [19] \n Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam. Those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) did not differ except, out of mutual jealousy, after knowledge had come to them. And whoever disbelieves in the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, then surely, Allah is Swift in calling to account.\n Surah Al-'Imran\n Ayah [71] \n O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): \"Why do you mix truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know?\"\n \n Surah Al-'Imran\n Ayah [65] \n O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you dispute about Ibrahim (Abraham), while the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) were not revealed till after him? Have you then no sense?\n \n They warn Muslims about the 'corrupting' influence of Christians and Jews...\n Surah Al-'Imran\n Ayah [118] \n O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bitanah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends, etc.) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed We have made plain to you the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses) if you understand\n \n \n Telling is the fact that they deny that the Prophets of old were Jews!\n Surah Al-'Imran\n Ayah [67] \n Ibrahim (Abraham) was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanifa (Islamic Monotheism - to worship none but Allah Alone) and he was not of Al-Mushrikun (See V.2:105).\n \n Again I must note that the insertions of words in the text are as given by the Islamic web-site.\n \n Moslems are warned about taking Jews and Christians as close firneds; because 'we' can corrupt them\n Koran\n \n 5:51 \n \n O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliya' (friends, protectors, helpers, etc.), they are but Auliya' to one another. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliya', then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers and unjust).\n \n \n \n \n \n Really the only time they are supposed to is in order to get new converts, or out of necessity.\n \n \n \n It is not permissible for a Muslim man or woman to take a male or female friend who is not a Muslim, because Allaah has forbidden us to love the kuffaar or take them as close friends and companions\n \n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=69876&dgn=4\n \n \n \n It is permissible for you to let your aunt stay with you so that you can call her to Islam and encourage her with wisdom and beautiful preaching, If she sees you and your good attitude and kind treatment, that may be a means of opening her heart to this great religion. Attitude and actions may often be more eloquent than words and preaching. So strive hard to do that, and if Allaah guides her at your hands, that will be better for you than this world and everything in it. \n \n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=70219&dgn=4\n \n \n \n Question : \n \n In the Quraan, it says that we can not take the Kuffaar as awliyaa, but what does that mean? I mean, to what degree? Can we do business with them still? If I'm at school, can we play basketball with them? Can we talk to them about basketball and stuff? Can we hang out with them as long as they keep their beliefs to themselves? The reason I ask is because someone I know does hang out with them in this way and it doesn't affect his beliefs, but I still tell him, \"Why don't you hang out with the muslims instead?\" He says that most or many of the Muslims drink and take drugs where they hang out and they have girlfriends and he's afraid that the sins of the Muslims will lure him, yet he's sure that the Kufr of the Kaafirs will not lure him because that's something that isn't attractive to him. So is hanging out with them, playing sports with them, and talking with them about sports considered as \"taking them as awliyaa instead of the believers\" keeping in mind that he is doing that for his own eemaan?.\n \n Answer : \n \n Praise be to Allaah. \n \n Firstly: \n \n Allaah has forbidden the believers to take the kaafireen (disbelievers) as friends, and He has issued a stern warning against doing that. \n \n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=59879&dgn=4\n They also discriminate in court\n \"...the testimony of a non-Muslim was not allowed in a Muslim shari'ah court, so if a Jew or Christian had a case against a Muslim, he would have to get Muslim witnesses...\"\n \n http://www.secularislam.net/archives/000017.html\n \n \n \n \"Under Islamic law statutes, the testimony of a Christian or any other non-Muslim carries only half the legal weight of a Muslim witness in a sharia court. So al-Muhtadi insisted that the judge must count his testimony as a Muslim to be stronger evidence than anything testified by his Christian sister....\"\n \n http://www.jihadwatch.org/dhimmiwatch/archives/005399.php\n \n \"Ibn Timiyya emphasizes forcefully in Volume 14,\n \n \n \n \"Nothing in the law of Muhammad states that the blood of the disbeliever is equal to the blood of the Muslim because faith is necessary for equality. The people of the Covenant (Jews or Christians) do not believe in Muhammad and Islam, thus their blood and the Muslim&#8217;s blood cannot be equal. These are distinctive texts which indicate that a Muslim is not to be put to death for (murdering) one of the people of the covenant or an unbeliever, but a free Muslim must be killed for a free Muslim, regardless of the race\" (Vol. 14, p. 85).\"\n \n http://www.amefufuka.com/islam/btv4.php",

Truly, God gives you the glad tidings of a Word from Him; his name shall be the Messiah Jesus the son of Mary, regarded in this world and the next and of those whose place is near to God. And he shall speak to people in his cradle, and when grown up, he shall be among the righteous.' \n \n She said, 'Lord! How can I have a son, when no man has ever touched me?'\n \n The angel said, 'Thus God creates what He pleases. When He decrees a matter, He only says \"BE\" and it is. He will teach him the Book, and wisdom, and the law, and the gospel, and he shall be a prophet to the people of Israel, saying, 'I have come to you, with a sign from God, namely, that I will create for you out of clay as though it were the form of a bird, and I will blow thereon and it shall become a bird by God's permission; and I will heal the blind from birth, and lepers; and I will bring the dead to life by God's permission; and I will tell you what you eat and what you store up in your houses. Behold! In all this is a sign for you if you are believers! And I will confirm what is before you of the law, and will surely make lawful for you some of that which was prohibited from you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear God and follow me, for God is my Lord, and your Lord, so worship Him: this alone is the right path.'\n \n And when Jesus perceived that they were unbelievers, he said, 'Who are my helpers for God?' The apostles said, 'We are God's helpers. We believe in God, so bear witness that we submit. Lord, we have believed in what you have revealed, and we have followed you, so write us down with those which bear witness.' but they (the Israelites) were crafty, and God was crafty, for God is the best of the crafty ones!\n \n When God said, 'O Jesus! I will make you die and take you up again to me and will clear you away from the unbelievers, and will make those who follow you above those unbelievers at the day of judgement when you shall return. I will decide between you concerning that wherein you disagree. And for those unbelievers, I will punish them with grievous punishment in this world and the next, and they shall have none to help them.' But as for those who believe and do what is right, He will pay them their reward, for God loves not the unjust.\n \n That is why we recite to you all these signs and tell you of the wise reminder.

And, ignoring that you've cited no evidence from any of Jesus' teachings to support their beliefs (whoever they are; that remains only in your own mind at this point).\n \n Again you need to construct an argument.\n I've done so.\n I've cited Islamic text, and Islamic interpretations of those texts. You've done absolutely nothing like that other than to give your opinion based on a supposition about what Moslems believe.\n'The exception proves the rule' means 'if the rule works in the exceptional cases, then it is proven'. Not that the fact the rule doesn't always work means that it's right.\n \n You never said 'Muslims are bad' or 'these Muslims are bad'. You said:\n \nNo, the Koran is quite explicit in it's villification of Jews; because you fail to realise that ALL Jews are deemed to have fallen from God's word; that's the very reason Al-lah sent Muhammed; to correct the many mistakes upheld by Jews and Christians.\n It is you, you see, who is deeply misinformed about Islam.\nThis was your original post: Koran and Islam, not Muslims.\n \n As for Christians using the Bible for hate, try the links to http://www.tencommandments.org/ and http://www.godhatesfags.com/\n \n \nSo you say. Your opinion is duly noted, oh great Islamic expert who doesn't even need to cite any evidence, and ignores the appallingly illogical consequences of denying any commonly held beliefs of anyone; that 'exceptions' make rules.\nIt is easier to find rank fundamentalism on the net than considered scholarship. Fortunately, I don't have to find a group as you launched an attack on Islam and the Koran, not modern Muslims.\n \n \nGreat.\n There's even 'there shall be no compulsion in religion' but understanding when the verse was recited, and for whom, you'd have a better understanding of Islam.\nSo what's the context of the Koran supporting the virginity of Mary that makes you doubt it's REALLY supporting her. I have given straightforward textual evidence, not reliant on bracketed interpretations by a sect of my choice. Where's your evidence against this?",

   "There's some hopeful verses about Christians (and Jews)\n \n Surah Al-Baqarah Ayah [111] \n And they say, \"None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.\" These are their own desires. Say (O Muhammad Peace be upon him ), \"Produce your proof if you are truthful.\"\n \n However this is saying what Jews and Christians say about Jews and Christians ;)\n But then within the same Surah...\n Surah Al-Baqarah\n Ayah [113] \n The Jews said that the Christians follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); and the Christians said that the Jews follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); though they both recite the Scripture. Like unto their word, said (the pagans) who know not. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they have been differing.\n \n Again they recognise Christians have 'failed' in understanding the message of God...\n Surah Al-'Imran\n Ayah [19] \n Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam. Those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) did not differ except, out of mutual jealousy, after knowledge had come to them. And whoever disbelieves in the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, then surely, Allah is Swift in calling to account.\n Surah Al-'Imran\n Ayah [71] \n O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): \"Why do you mix truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know?\"\n \n Surah Al-'Imran\n Ayah [65] \n O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you dispute about Ibrahim (Abraham), while the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) were not revealed till after him? Have you then no sense?\n \n They warn Muslims about the 'corrupting' influence of Christians and Jews...\n Surah Al-'Imran\n Ayah [118] \n O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bitanah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends, etc.) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed We have made plain to you the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses) if you understand\n \n \n Telling is the fact that they deny that the Prophets of old were Jews!\n Surah Al-'Imran\n Ayah [67] \n Ibrahim (Abraham) was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanifa (Islamic Monotheism - to worship none but Allah Alone) and he was not of Al-Mushrikun (See V.2:105).\n \n Again I must note that the insertions of words in the text are as given by the Islamic web-site.\n \n Moslems are warned about taking Jews and Christians as close firneds; because 'we' can corrupt them\n Koran\n \n 5:51 \n \n O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliya' (friends, protectors, helpers, etc.), they are but Auliya' to one another. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliya', then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers and unjust).\n \n \n \n \n \n Really the only time they are supposed to is in order to get new converts, or out of necessity.\n \n \n \n It is not permissible for a Muslim man or woman to take a male or female friend who is not a Muslim, because Allaah has forbidden us to love the kuffaar or take them as close friends and companions\n \n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=69876&dgn=4\n \n \n \n It is permissible for you to let your aunt stay with you so that you can call her to Islam and encourage her with wisdom and beautiful preaching, If she sees you and your good attitude and kind treatment, that may be a means of opening her heart to this great religion. Attitude and actions may often be more eloquent than words and preaching. So strive hard to do that, and if Allaah guides her at your hands, that will be better for you than this world and everything in it. \n \n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=70219&dgn=4\n \n \n \n Question : \n \n In the Quraan, it says that we can not take the Kuffaar as awliyaa, but what does that mean? I mean, to what degree? Can we do business with them still? If I'm at school, can we play basketball with them? Can we talk to them about basketball and stuff? Can we hang out with them as long as they keep their beliefs to themselves? The reason I ask is because someone I know does hang out with them in this way and it doesn't affect his beliefs, but I still tell him, \"Why don't you hang out with the muslims instead?\" He says that most or many of the Muslims drink and take drugs where they hang out and they have girlfriends and he's afraid that the sins of the Muslims will lure him, yet he's sure that the Kufr of the Kaafirs will not lure him because that's something that isn't attractive to him. So is hanging out with them, playing sports with them, and talking with them about sports considered as \"taking them as awliyaa instead of the believers\" keeping in mind that he is doing that for his own eemaan?.\n \n Answer : \n \n Praise be to Allaah. \n \n Firstly: \n \n Allaah has forbidden the believers to take the kaafireen (disbelievers) as friends, and He has issued a stern warning against doing that. \n \n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=59879&dgn=4\n They also discriminate in court\n \"...the testimony of a non-Muslim was not allowed in a Muslim shari'ah court, so if a Jew or Christian had a case against a Muslim, he would have to get Muslim witnesses...\"\n \n http://www.secularislam.net/archives/000017.html\n \n \n \n \"Under Islamic law statutes, the testimony of a Christian or any other non-Muslim carries only half the legal weight of a Muslim witness in a sharia court. So al-Muhtadi insisted that the judge must count his testimony as a Muslim to be stronger evidence than anything testified by his Christian sister....\"\n \n http://www.jihadwatch.org/dhimmiwatch/archives/005399.php\n \n \"Ibn Timiyya emphasizes forcefully in Volume 14,\n \n \n \n \"Nothing in the law of Muhammad states that the blood of the disbeliever is equal to the blood of the Muslim because faith is necessary for equality. The people of the Covenant (Jews or Christians) do not believe in Muhammad and Islam, thus their blood and the Muslim's blood cannot be equal. These are distinctive texts which indicate that a Muslim is not to be put to death for (murdering) one of the people of the covenant or an unbeliever, but a free Muslim must be killed for a free Muslim, regardless of the race\" (Vol. 14, p. 85).\"\n \n http://www.amefufuka.com/islam/btv4.php\n\n \n This post is so Montalbanesque.\n \n This topic was a favorite of Montalban's also.\n \n Say, isn't Bradamante a character from the Battle of Montalban?:)",

   "Bradamante:\n \n First, I have, as I said, read and reread your posts with the respect they deserve. My earlier apology still stands despite some areas of disagreement.\n \n Second, I apologize if I am covering things that you have already responded to. As I had said, I am not really web-literate so I had to gather my old hard copy books and type much of it by hand. I did finally get some help on the web... it just took a long time. I have Biblical websites and software, but not Islamic. I studied Islam a long time ago.\n \n Anyway...\n \n Much of what you say is accurate. Some of what you say is inaccurate. I will address the inaccuracies to the degree I can.\n \n Some of what I had said earlier (and as you had noted correctly I did not supply backup for) still seems to have some validity. There are various translations of the Qur'an/Koran and many are inadequate. The translation of 'Abdullah Yusuf 'Ali is one of the most respected translations. It was first published in the 1930's and was revised in the 1980's.\n \n Yusuf Ali's translation has become the most widely approved translation of the Qur'an among the Muslims and for this reason it is the translation used throughout this book (except where indicated otherwise). This work truly deserves popularity for, although the author was a Shi'ite Muslim, it is a work that breathes out freshness and rarely shows sectarian bias such as is found in many other Muslim translations. (An Introduction to Islam: Islamic Institute of New York; 1988)\n \n Another highly respected translation is that of M. M. Pickthall\n \n Muhammad Marmeduke Pickthall, The Meaning of the Glorious Koran. This translation of the Qur'an is one of the most widely accepted translations of the Qur'an into English by English speaking Muslims. If you are able to read the Qur'an in Arabic, please feel free to do so (Preferred texts of Emerson College Professor Gordon D. Newby)\n \n Among numerous English translations, Marmaduke Pickthall's and Yusuf Ali's are the most widely-known and used in the world. Yusuf Ali started work on his translation in 1934 and completed it some four years later. (Sherif, M A: A Biography of Abdullah Yusuf Ali: 1994)\n \n A third is that of M. H. Shakir. It is the preferred translation of the University of Southern California. \n \n These are the translation I will use. Most often I will use Yusuf Ali's (YUSUFALI) because that is the one I am most familiar with. If there is no definite citation, the verse will most likely be the YUSUFALI translation. However I will also cite PICKTHAL and SHAKIR.\n \n My reason for doing this is to show that some of the translations you cite and the conclusion they may lead to do not represent all of Islam or the belief of all Muslims.\n \n \nHere's what the Koran has to say about Jews...\n The Koran says that the Jews like like donkeys!\n \n 62: 5 The likeness of those who were entrusted with the Taurat (Torah), but who subsequently failed in those (obligations), is as the likeness of a donkey who carries huge burdens of books (but understands nothing from them). How bad is the example (or the likeness) of people who deny the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah. And Allah guides not the people who are Zalimun (polytheists, wrong-doers, disbelievers, etc.).\nYou make the statement: \"Here is what the Koran has to say about Jews... The Koran says that the Jews are like donkeys\". That is inaccurate. The verses in the Qur'an which you cite specifically refer to those who failed in their obligations with regard to Mosaic Law. What you say would be like saying, \"Here is what Jesus said about \"Jews\" and \"intellectuals\": Mt:23:27 \"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.\"\n \n What Jesus said refers to those who distorted the teachings of Mosaic Law. What the Qu'ran is talking about in this verse you cite (62:5) are those Jews who have failed to live according to Mosaic Law, not all Jews. Just as Jesus does not mean \"all Jews\" as he criticizes those who have transgressed.\n \n Here are the translations from those three most respected translations of the Qur'an.\n \n YUSUFALI: The similitude of those who were charged with the (obligations of the) Mosaic Law, but who subsequently failed in those (obligations), is that of a donkey which carries huge tomes (but understands them not). Evil is the similitude of people who falsify the Signs of Allah: and Allah guides not people who do wrong. \n PICKTHAL: The likeness of those who are entrusted with the Law of Moses, yet apply it not, is as the likeness of the XXX carrying books. Wretched is the likeness of folk who deny the revelations of Allah. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. \n SHAKIR: The likeness of those who were charged with the Taurat, then they did not observe it, is as the likeness of the XXX bearing books, evil is the likeness of the people who reject the communications of Allah; and Allah does not guide the unjust people.\n \n \n2:96 says that they are the greediest people...\n And verily, you will find them (the Jews) the greediest of mankind for life and (even greedier) than those who - ascribe partners to Allah (and do not believe in Resurrection - Magians, pagans, and idolaters, etc.). Everyone of them wishes that he could be given a life of a thousand years. But the grant of such life will not save him even a little from (due) punishment. And Allah is All-Seer of what they do.\nHere you take the verse out of context. Here is the full context of the verse:\n \n 92. There came to you Moses with clear (Signs); yet ye worshipped the calf (Even) after that, and ye did behave wrongfully. \n 93. And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai): (Saying): \"Hold firmly to what We have given you, and hearken (to the Law)\": They said:\" We hear, and we disobey:\" And they had to drink into their hearts (of the taint) of the calf because of their Faithlessness. Say: \"Vile indeed are the behests of your Faith if ye have any faith!\" \n 94. Say: \"If the last Home, with Allah, be for you specially, and not for anyone else, then seek ye for death, if ye are sincere.\" \n 95. But they will never seek for death, on account of the (sins) which their hands have sent on before them. and Allah is well-acquainted with the wrong-doers. \n 96. Thou wilt indeed find them, of all people, most greedy of life,-even more than the idolaters: Each one of them wishes He could be given a life of a thousand years: But the grant of such life will not save him from (due) punishment. For Allah sees well all that they do. \n \n Putting the verse in context makes it clear that The Qur'an is not talking about all Jews, but about those who rejected the teachings of Moses and worshipped the \"fatted calf\". A story told in Exodus. Jews also condemned the same thing.\n \n \n2:61 says that al-lah stamped wrtechedness upon them.\nThe \"them\" you refer to again is not all Jews, it is those who were discontent with Moses leadership. The same story is told in the Bible when the Jews were in dire need of water, God had water come from a stone. After that the people wanted more.\n \n There is little difference between the punishment meted out by the God of Abraham for the Jew's \"sins\" and those cited in the Qur'an. The Flood. Sodom and Gomorrah. The wandering in the desert. The Babylonian Captivity. Bondage in Egypt. These are all Biblical punishments of the Jews by God. The Qur'an picks up on that theme. It also metes out severe punishment for Muslims who transgress. \n \n Putting verse 61 in context::\n \n 59. But the transgressors changed the word from that which had been given them; so We sent on the transgressors a plague from heaven, for that they infringed (Our command) repeatedly. \n 60. And remember Moses prayed for water for his people; We said: \"Strike the rock with thy staff.\" Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs. Each group knew its own place for water. So eat and drink of the sustenance provided by Allah, and do no evil nor mischief on the (face of the) earth. \n 61. And remember ye said: \"O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth, -its pot-herbs, and cucumbers, Its garlic, lentils, and onions.\" He said: \"Will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town, and ye shall find what ye want!\" They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. This because they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah and slaying His Messengers without just cause. This because they rebelled and went on transgressing. \n \n Note specifically that verse 59 refers to \"the transgressors\" not \"all the Jews\".\n \n \n4:61 Says that they (and Christians) believe in idols\nThat is what the translation you are using may say. Here are other translations:\n \n YUSUFALI: When it is said to them: \"Come to what Allah hath revealed, and to the Messenger\": Thou seest the Hypocrites avert their faces from thee in disgust. \n PICKTHAL: And when it is said unto them: Come unto that which Allah hath revealed and unto the messenger, thou seest the hypocrites turn from thee with aversion. \n SHAKIR: And when it is said to them: Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Messenger, you will see the hypocrites turning away from you with (utter) aversion \n \n In his footnotes, YUSUFALI makes clear that the people referred to in these verses are the Munafiquin (hypocrites) of Medina, but in a general way includes people who put their personal interests above what is right while at the same time appear righteous.\n \n \n5:52 they are cursed.\nThere is no question that the Qur'an preaches that Jews and Christians who reject God are not to be trusted because they rejected the teachings of God through their prophets. In this way they are cursed. The verse however begins with the words: \n \n 52. Those in whose hearts is a disease...\n \n Those are the \"they\" which are cursed, not \"all\".\n \n Jesus did the same in Matthew 23:14-33. He called those who transgressed everything from bugs to snakes.\n \n \n5:93 the Jews are cursed\nYou may have use the wrong reference numbers because verse 5:93 reads:\n \n 93. On those who believe and do deeds of righteousness there is no blame for what they ate (in the past), when they guard themselves from evil, and believe, and do deeds of righteousness,- (or) again, guard themselves from evil and believe,- (or) again, guard themselves from evil and do good. For Allah loveth those who do good. \n \n \n5:51 don't take a Jew as a friend\nNo question about this. It is however a reflection of the political hatred on the part of Jew and Muslims at the time. There was very little trust. I think you will find that feeling exists even today buy both to the other.\n \n \n5:53 Jews (and Christians) are losers\nAgain the context of verse 53 is that it follows verse 52:\n \n 52. Those in whose hearts is a disease - thou seest how eagerly they run about amongst them, saying: \"We do fear lest a change of fortune bring us disaster.\" Ah! perhaps Allah will give (thee) victory, or a decision according to His will. Then will they repent of the thoughts which they secretly harboured in their hearts. \n 53. And those who believe will say: \"Are these the men who swore their strongest oaths by Allah, that they were with you?\" All that they do will be in vain, and they will fall into (nothing but) ruin.\n \n It is clear that these verses are about \"those in whose hearts is a disease.\"\n \n \n5:57 Don't choose Jews, (or Christians, or disbelievers) as guardians\nThe verses actually say don't choose those who mock you. The verse sounds like good advice given the tensions between Muslims and others (including Arabs) at the time.\n \n 57. O ye who believe! take not for friends and protectors those who take your religion for a mockery or sport,- whether among those who received the Scripture before you, or among those who reject Faith; but fear ye Allah, if ye have faith (indeed).\n \n But the Qur'an also begs the Jews and Christians for an explanation of their behavior toward Muslims.\n \n 59. Say: \"O people of the Book! Do ye disapprove of us for no other reason than that we believe in Allah, and the revelation that hath come to us and that which came before (us), and (perhaps) that most of you are rebellious and disobedient?\"\n \n \n5:59 Jews (and Christians) are evil-doers\nSee 5:59 as translated above. I do not see that as \"evil doers\", but rather as sinners - rebellious and disobedient.\n \n \n5:63 Rabbis do evil\nNot much different than Jesus criticism of the Scribes and Pharisees.",

Moslems consider Moses as a prophet, and they consider that the Jews failed to heed Moses; else there'd be no need for further prophets.\nYou have to back up that it is a Qur'anic Doctrine that \"ALL Jews failed to heed Moses.\" As you so correctly said to me, just repeating it doesn't make it true.\n \n \nAs noted, my own citation has the inclusion saying that this is the Christians; this is a site you agree is an authority.\nDoes that mean a Abdullah Yusuf Ali website?\n \n \nThe problem then remains for you is you believe you've two authorities, that disagree, so for you there's a difference in opinion. \nNot exactly, I cited three of the most respected translations of the Qur'an which have gone through peer review by other Muslim and independent non-Islamic religious scholars. I have quoted extensively from them. I have found no evidence that any of the translations that you have cited have had peer review - except the one you say I posted as well, which I have to honestly tell you I can't figure out. There are many incorrect translations on the web - some posted by Islamophobic sources.\n \n \nI have no reference to your quoting Yusuf Ali on this to verify.\nI have quoted you chapter and verse. Real books are still legitimate sources last I looked.\n \n \nI apologise for only dealing with some of your objections due to time constraint.\nNo problem, I should thank you for responding so graciously. \n \n Perhaps we can make this easy.\n \n I am simply saying that SOME MUSLIMS believe that ALL JEWS and ALL CHRISTIANS are damned by God and ALL MUSLIMS BELIEVE that SOME JEWS and SOME CHRISTIANS are damned by God. If we can agree on that we have no issue.\n \n If your contention is that it is Qur'anic Doctrine that ALL JEWS and ALL CHIRSTIANS are damned and that ALL MUSLIMS believe that ALL JEWS and ALL CHRISTIANS are damned, you are going to have to back that up.\n \n All the best.",

   "Bradamante:That would have been an accurate statement that I would agree with. The reverse is also true of some Jews.\n\n So then you're problem then is why it's only picking on groups of Jews all the time.\n \n\n You will have to support the contention that all Muslims believe that &#8220;ALL Jews have failed in understanding God&#8217;s message.&#8221; That would mean that it is a Qur'anic Doctrine. I am not aware that there is any Qur'anic Doctrine accepted by all Muslims to that effect.\n\n I already explained this; the very reason Moslems believe that Muhammed was 'necessary' was because previous generations; Jews and Christians had failed in understanding the message of God. \n \n Surah Al-Baqarah\n Ayah [109] \n Many of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their ownselves, even, after the truth (that Muhammad Peace be upon him is Allah's Messenger) has become manifest unto them. But forgive and overlook, till Allah brings His Command. Verily, Allah is Able to do all things. \n \n \n \n Anyway, try some short verses such as\n \n Surah \n \n Al-Baqarah\n Ayah [77] \n Know they (Jews) not that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal? \n \n Surah \n \n Al-Baqarah\n Ayah [78] \n And there are among them (Jews) unlettered people, who know not the Book, but they trust upon false desires and they but guess. \n \n \n \n Surah Al-Baqarah\n Ayah [145] \n And even if you were to bring to the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) all the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they would not follow your Qiblah (prayer direction), nor are you going to follow their Qiblah (prayer direction). And they will not follow each other's Qiblah (prayer direction). Verily, if you follow their desires after that which you have received of knowledge (from Allah), then indeed you will be one of the Zalimun (polytheists, wrong-doers, etc.).",

   "There's just so many verses that show that Jews and Christians have missed out\n \n Surah Al-Ma'idah\n Ayah [65] \n And if only the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) had believed (in Muhammad ) and warded off evil (sin, ascribing partners to Allah) and had become AlMuttaqun (the pious - see V.2:2) We would indeed have blotted out their sins and admitted them to Gardens of pleasure (in Paradise). \n \n Surah Al-An'am\n Ayah [20] \n Those to whom We have given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) recognize him (i.e. Muhammad as a Messenger of Allah, and they also know that there is no Ilah (God) but Allah and Islam is Allah's Religion), as they recognize their own sons. Those who destroy themselves will not believe .

   "THE ANGEL OF THE LORD\n \n It is my contention and the contention of many Biblical scholars that the God of the burning bush episode - \"THE\" Angel of the Lord - is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ. \n \n In Hebrew, the word for \"angel\" is malakh. A malakh is a messenger, either human or angelic. Yet there is one (divine) malakh who stands out from all the rest. The Bible calls him simply, \"THE angel of the Lord.\" Whenever you see this \"angel\" / messenger in the Old Testament, he is acting, talking, or doing \"Divine\" things. Case in point:\n \n Zech. 3:1 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to oppose him.\n 2 And the Lord said to Satan, \"The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\"\n 3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the Angel. 4 Then He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, \"Take away the filthy garments from him.\" And to him He said, \"See, I have removed your iniquity from you, and I will clothe you with rich robes\" (note Isaiah 61:10).\n \n Many more examples in the links below. Jesus is the Great \"I AM\" God of the burning bush! He gave the law to Moses and then gave the Sermon on the Mount too.\n \n http://www.ourchurch.com/view/?pageID=74742\n \n http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Rampart/7131/AngLord.html\n \n Praise the Great God and Savior Jesus Christ.\n Like a good old-fashioned biblical paradox?\n \n Genesis 16 -- After Hagar fled into the wilderness to escape from Sarah, Abraham's wife, the Angel of the Lord promised to greatly multiply her descendants and prophesied the birth of Ishmael, who became the progenitor on the Arab nations.\n \n Genesis 22 -- read by Jews every Yom Kippur, it is the Angel of the Lord who called from heaven to stay the hand of Abraham as he took the knife to slay his son Isaac.\n \n Genesis 32:30 -- Jacob wrestled with a \"man\" during the night who blessed the patriarch and changed his name to Israel. Jacob responded by calling the place of this encounter Peniel, saying, 'it is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.' Jacob identified the \"Man\" as God.\n \n Genesis 48:15,16 -- when Jacob blessed his son Joseph and his children, he said, \"The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my Shepherd all my life to this day, the Angel who has delivered me from all harm.\"\n \n Exodus 3:2 -- The Angel of the Lord appeared to Moses in the midst of a burning bush but then in verse 4, it was \"God (the Father) who called to Him from within the bush.\"\n \n Exodus 13:21 -- When the Lord delivered the children of Israel from Egypt, the Bible says, \"By day the Lord went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light.\"\n \n Exodus 14:19 -- He was in the pillar of cloud guiding the Israelites through the wilderness after their flight from Egypt. The \"Angel of God,\" who had been traveling in front of Israel's army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them, coming in between the armies of Egypt and Israel. And then in verse 24 we are told that the Lord looked down on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and cloud, and fought against Egypt! Who is involved in this pillar - the Angel of the Lord or God Himself! They must, in context, be one and the same.\n \n Numbers 22:22-35 -- He appeared to Balaam, the pagan prophet, and gave him orders, even commanding the donkey to speak.\n \n Joshua 5:13-15 -- \"The Man with a Sword in His Hand\" is humbly identified as \"Commander of the Army of the LORD.\" Joshua fell to his face and worshipped Him and called Him \"My Lord.\" \n \n Judges 6 -- This same Christophany told Gideon to deliver Israel from Midian. The Angel of the Lord appeared to a timid Gideon and sat down under an oak tree to initiate a conversation with him (vss. 11,12). In verse 13, we see Gideon responding, but in verse 14 something strange happens: all of a sudden it is the Lord who is seen talking to Gideon! In verse 16, the conversation continues, but in verse 20, it is the Angel of God who is in conversation. The next verse relates that a miracle is performed by the angel. Then Gideon responds: 'Ah, Sovereign LORD! I have seen the Angel of the LORD face to face!' But the LORD said to him, \"Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die!\"\n \n Judges 13:22 -- prophesied the birth of Samson. The parents, likewise, recognized the Angel of the Lord to be God, \"We are doomed to die!...We have seen God!\"\n \n I Kings 19 -- directed Elijah to Mt. Horeb.\n \n I Chronicles 21:18 -- commanded King David to build an altar in Jerusalem which later became the site of the temple of Solomon.\n \n 2 Kings19:35 -- killed the 185,000 Assyrian soldiers besieging Jerusalem.\n \n Zechariah 1:12 -- the Angel of the Lord is seen interceding on behalf of Israel, calling out to the Lord of hosts!\n \n http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Rampart/7131/AngLord.html\n \n Jesus is God!",

Did you say unto men: 'Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?' \" He will say: \"Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say).

However Moslems also believe Jews and Christians failed in properly adhering to the word of God. \nEach religion believes that of the other religions. In fact, within each religion there are denominations that believe this of other denominations. To single out Islam is a subtle smear of an entire group of believers. In Christianity there were Christian denominations that smeared Catholicism in the same way - they used to call them \"papists\". In the US, JFK was the first Catholic president because this type of prejudice had so taken hold in the US.\n \n \nWhy else do you think Muhammed came onto the scene? You've still not caught onto this no matter how many times I've raised it. The very reason Muslims content Muhammed was necessary was BECAUSE the message of Allah was screwed up successively by Jews and Christians.\nI think that what you fail to grasp it that this reasoning is the same reasoning given for the necessity of Jesus Christ, Siddhartha, Krishna and Joseph Smith. It was also the reasoning of Martin Luther, John Calvin, John and Charles Wesley (founder of the Methodist Church), Knox (founder of the Presbyterian Church), Seabury (founder of the Episcopalian Church). The reasoning is \"They've got it wrong, my guys got it right.\"\n \n \nIt's the same site you recommended I read!\nPlease post that site again please because I am nto sure which site you mean or why I referred to it. Also, I do not believe everything I read in every website. I can agree with some things they say and disagree with others - just like I am with you.\n \n \nYou still haven't been able to grasp Islamic thinking. You need to understand Islam how Moslems understand it.\nAnd you do? When I started to quote from books and articles by major Islamic scholars, you claimed that you could not verify my quotes. That implied you did not have the books and very possibly were not familiar with their writings. You basically wanted to limit the sources to internet sources. That leads me to believe that most of the Islamic \"scholars\" you are familiar are internet \"scholars\".\n \n \nFor them Muhammed was called on by God because the message had been lost; it's also why they proclaim no other prophet will come after him, because the message is finally 'right'.\nEvery religion has stories about how their religion is the right way and the others are wrong. Jews, Christians and Muslims all believe their way is the right way. They all emerged from the same region and have battled each others for centuries. You seem to ignore how similar they all are.",

   "For those who quote the Old Testament, you are speaking against Judaism. Christianity stems from the New Testament, hence the word \"Christ\" in Christianity. If the Old Testament was perfect, Christ would not have asked his disciples to spread his Word. Did Jesus do any of the things that you attack regarding Christians? Did he have slaves? Did he attack his neighbor? By ignoring Christ's life and teachings altogether, you are not discussing the same religion that you are trying to attack. In fact, you are displaying complete ignorance to it, which makes your argument and posts quite dismissible and uninteresting.\n \n The New Testament quotes are instructions for slaves, not for their masters to enslave people. The Christian ideal says to submit and love. There is nothing inconsistent in this ideal in telling a slave to not fight, but love and respect his master. Jesus was himself enslaved by humanity, and submitted in all ways.\n \n If all you are saying is that Christians are not perfect as individual people, then good for you; you can now graduate from preschool and enter into the shocking reality in which we live. The Christian ideal, however, is something different altogether.",

   "Bradamante, thanks for the nice Karen Armstrong links. I am quite impressed by her views:\n \n \n\"I was deeply shocked that people could call other people 'dirty Arabs' when some 30 or 40 years before they had talked in Europe about 'dirty Jews'. I was struck by the inability of the Jewish people to learn from past sufferings, but of course it is human nature that suffering does not make us better. The problem with Israel now is that it cannot believe that it is not 1939 any more; the Israeli people are emotionally stuck in the horrors of the Nazi era,\" she says. \nhttp://www.inminds.co.uk/boycott-news-0296.html\n \n I'm thinking of using Armstrong's column in the Guardian as my Christmas message this year:\n \n \nWhen God goes to war \n Religions usually espouse peace and goodwill, so why have they sparked so many conflicts? \n Karen Armstrong\n Monday December 29, 2003\n The Guardian\n . . . .Religion is the creation of human beings, who are biologically programmed for aggression. We dream of peace but slaughter our own kind, and from the very start our faith systems have reflected this tragic dualism. In the earliest religions, most gods were militant, including Yahweh, worshipped by Jews, Christians and Muslims. Humans were able to enjoy security only by fighting other groups, so they assumed there was also perpetual warfare in the divine world, in which the gods opposed the forces of disorder. \n \n The world religions that developed during the first millennium BCE rejected this bellicose theology and preached empathy, compassion, even non-violence. But they all emerged in societies devastated by war, and this pervasive aggression seeped into their new scriptures. Judaism, for example, was born out of the wrenching experience of political annihilation, deportation and exile - a trauma that left its mark on the Hebrew Bible. \n \n Some of the biblical writers responded to the violence in kind. Their God commands Moses and Joshua to massacre all the native inhabitants of the Promised Land. But others spoke of reconciliation and of respect for the stranger. They reminded the people of Israel that God was not reflexively on their side, and their own unjust and irresponsible behaviour had contributed to the disaster. \n \n Jesus told his followers to love their enemies, but the New Testament was also affected by the turbulence of Palestine during the first century: the resentment of Roman occupation and escalating tension between Jews and Christians. Later, the emperor Domitian's persecution inspired the vengeful fantasies of the Book of Revelation. \n \n The Koran also reflects the brutal tribal warfare that afflicted Arabia during the early 7th century. For five years, the Muslims were threatened with extermination and had to fight for their lives. The Koran tells Muslims how they should behave on the battlefield, but these militant passages always end with exhortations to reconciliation. Eventually, Muhammad brought peace to the peninsula by adopting an audacious policy of non-violence.\n \n The scriptures all bear scars of their violent begetting, so it is easy for extremists to find texts that seem to give a seal of divine approval to hatred. War affects all aspects of human behaviour, so when conflict becomes chronic, it should be no surprise that religion is also infected. This is certainly what happened at the time of the Crusades. . . . \nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,2763,1113570,00.html",

Adam was a Muslim, in fact he was the first prophet and the deputy (khalif) of Allah. Abraham was also a Muslim, as you point out (though your quote doesn't say 'first'). It seems clear that this means something like 'first among', as in greatest, or 'first of the generation as that Muslim says.\n \n \nDepends which you choose.\nSo there's no earth?

How does one say \"I'm seeking God by not looking for God?\"\nThe methods don't deny God. They are connected to a belief that the underlying truth reached is not essentially theistic, but that doesn't mean that they can't quieten your mind and help you reach God\n \n \n \n \n \nI don't reject Maths because maths is not about God. However if you tried to find God by maths, then you'd have a proper analogy; because Buddhism and Maths are not about God. In fact you sort of answered your own question here - would YOU recommend say, using organic chemistry to find God?\n \n Buddhism is worse, because it is a spiritual path that actually leads away from God.\nDo people never find God in the order of maths or the beauty of Creation?\n \n RS Thomas, a poet-priest of Wales, wrote of God telling some to find him\n in the angles between\n stars, in the equations\n of My kingdom\n \n In another he says 'I begin to see you anew, God of form and number'\n \n \nMatthew 11:15\nSo you have no duty to try and communicate in a way people will understand?",

   "and you my friend, are not alone in your thinking.....at all! I was raised a catholic, went to catholic school my entire life. I was forced to have scripture class daily for all 4 years of HS, and the more they taught me, the more I doubted them....my parents both being educated taught me critical thinking skills......now I am an athiest. I just don't believe in any of the gods presented so far. I also think the idea of a god seems so Eartly, what about other planets and life there....are we to assume that Jesus went to all the other planets and died on crosses there too? how absurd. We are on planet of millions......if there is life out there...this whole Jesus thing is the sillest yet!\n\n Same here. I was actually really religious at one point. I thought that the Bible was an eyewitness account. Then I recalled a teacher (in Catholic school0 saying that other religions started as a way to understand what made know sense, so they gave it the name \"God\" and attributed phenomena to \"God\". He left out that that same history would certainly fit Christianity. And, you'll probably appreciate this :) , when, in 8th grade (I was in 7th) my friend, Caralee, was in religion class, the teacher said being gay was a sin. Caralee screamed-at/argued-with at the teacher. She came to lunch in a horrible mood and told us what happened. We decided to pester the priests. He said gay people have to be celibate because they can't produce children. For about 10 seconds I bought it. Then I got confused about all those old people that are past menopause. Now I wonder how \"God loves everyone\" but is vengeful enough to create people gay then send them to Hell for being who they are. It doesn't add up. I'm atheist/agnostic (not to be presumptuous as I cannot disprove God's existence...though to quote Asimov \"I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have. Somehow, it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I'm a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally, I am an atheist.
