I believe this is what our founding fathers had in mind both when drafting the second ammendment and in their comments regarding standing armies (to my mind, police trained in military tactics and armed with machine guns, tanks, and hand grenades are indistinguishable from a standing army).\n \n I understand that police feel they need machine guns, tanks, swat teams, etc... So they can take down the opposition wiht minimal risk to themselves and a minimal amount of fuss. It seems that this is what the founding fatehrs wished to avoid. They didn't want the government to be able to take down opposition without fuss or risk. There was meant to BE risk in government agents using force against Americans",

   "Not really. LE requirements almost are universally minimal on shooting standards. Officers and deputies are for the most part required to pass an annual test with no other requirements. There is rarely any requirements for officers to shoot a certain amount of ammunition per week or month. There is no range time benefits offered to them and I very rarely see any LEO's on the range on their own time.\n \n If you look at the stats, there are a lot more negligent discharges made by LEO's than civilians no matter how you break the data down. Most of these incidents involve accidental self inflicted wounds too. I was giving a class on weapons familiarization with a high profile police department near DC in the early 90's. One of the attendees was the head of the SWAT team in that county. He disobeyed the safety rules by having a loaded magazine (even just having ammo is bad) in the classroom and nearly shot another student and me with an MP5. He is the reason I refuse to teach certain things to law enforcement agencies. They simply don't know how to use it and for the most part, I question the need for them to know it.\n \n As for marksmanship, I've seen a few SWAT snipers that take their jobs seriously enough to really put the effort into what they are doing but many of them have the paper plate mentality whereas if they can hit a paper plate at 100 or 200 yards, they are happy since the stats show that the average distance for a civilian police sniper engagement is about 77 yards.\n \n Also bear in mind that some very dangerous things have come about somehow with LEO snipers. I don't know who got this idea but that person needs to be flogged... I'm sure you have seen the footage of the guy sitting in a chair in the middle of the street with a handgun threatening to kill himself. Then suddenly, a sniper shoots the gun out of his hand. You've seen this? If not, look for it on the internet. But my point with this is that yeah, the guy lived but have you considered where that bullet went after it hit the handgun? It was deflected by the handgun and luckily, it went into the hill behind the guy. It very easily could have taken an upward arc and hit an innocent person down range somewhere. \n \n I'm sorry but this kind of stunt is NOT what our LEO's should be doing. \n \n Law enforcement should meet a very high standard of marksmanship and gun handling safety requirements. They don't. They use minimal standards that are sometimes so poor that they wouldn't qualify to pass an NRA civilian basic training program. \n \n Now, with this being said, there are a few very rare exceptions to the rule regarding LEO's. I know several who are some of the finest shots alive. They are definitely in the top 1% of shooters in the world. But like I said, they are very few and far between.\n \n Mike",
