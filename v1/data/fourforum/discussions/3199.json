   " From the Website\n \n Thank you for visiting my website and for your interest in supporting my continued leadership of this nation.\n In the year 2000, America came together to cast its suggestion for President. Some of you were with the program and made the right choice, but more than half of you tried to pick somebody else for my job. Fortunately, we have a Supreme Court that understands the damage which can be done when democracy is turned over to regular citizens. \n The Supreme Court didn't just select a failed businessman, former owner of the Texas Rangers, and Governor of Texas to be President of the United States. They selected a regular Joe who just happened to be the son of a former President, who just happened to have some serious questions about the completion of his military duty, and who just happened to have been arrested on three separate occasions. \n Since I took office, I've made it my top concern to make decisions on the basis of what's best for the American people. By \"American people,\" of course, I mean my administration and the wealthiest donors to my campaign. For what it's worth, I think I've done a pretty good job so far.\n But man, I have big plans for my second term. First things first, it's time to abolish that stupid rule that says I can only be President for eight years. That's just silly. There's still so much to do.\n In closing, I want to thank God for everything. I'm not saying I couldn't have done it without you, though, so don't get any ideas. \n\n \n Hmm.... This would be better on the Fun Debate forum. You think, joe?",
