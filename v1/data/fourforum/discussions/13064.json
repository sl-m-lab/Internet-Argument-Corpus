   "  Midlands former soldier claims troops smuggle weapons to gangs \n British troops are smuggling guns and drugs into the UK and Europe and selling them on to criminal gangs, a former soldier from the Midlands has claimed\n \n The ex-serviceman said it was \"mega-easy\" to bring back weapons from Iraq and Afghanistan and said some soldiers had become adept at hiding weapons and shipping them back from the frontline.\n \n Handguns are brought back inside field radios and tool boxes - while grenades are hidden inside tank gun barrels for collection on arrival in Britain or Europe, he said\n \n The crooked soldiers also concealed weapons in the fuel tanks of armoured vehicles and inside wheels to avoid detection.\n \n \"A lot of weapons get back to the UK, but some end up in military bases in countries like Germany and are then sold to European criminal gangs,'' said the former Midlands serviceman.\n \n \"It's mega-easy to smuggle them back. The military will say that this is isolated, or that the systems in place are 100 per cent safe - but that isn't the case.\n \n \"It's mainly handguns being brought back, because a rifle would have to be broken down and split up. If any part of the whole rifle is intercepted then the weapon is useless.\n \n \"Having said that, British military weapons and ammunition go missing all the time and where do you think they end up?\"\n \n A Birmingham soldier who served in Iraq was jailed for seven years in 2006 for handling a stolen rifle.\n \n L/Cpl James Piotrowski, from Northfield, pleaded guilty to possessing and handling the SA80 after another soldier stole it from a barracks in London.\n \n I already know the Anti-gun dodge for this one. They will say, But it is only the words of disgruntled soldiers! No real proof! The article only mentioned one soldier was jaild for having a handgun and a machine gun! \n   Midlands former soldier claims troops smuggle weapons to gangs \n A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: '\"This is a serious issue and we have a huge responsibility to stop military personnel from abusing the position of trust they are in.\n",
