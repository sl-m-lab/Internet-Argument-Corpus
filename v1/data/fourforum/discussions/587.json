If the 625K figure is used, the percentage of households with full auto weapons jumps to 22%. Also, this figure is only for FULL AUTO weapons. What about semi-auto or single shot weapons? My guess is that this percentage is higher when these are included. Also, your link mentions that ammo must be registered if bought at a store, but not if bought at a range and the overwhelming majority of ammo is bought at private ranges and the rule that the ammo must be used at the range is not inforced. Therefore essentially military ammo can be bought and posessed outside of military service. Finally it mentions that Swiss \"gun control\" is not the reason for the low crime rates and, granted, it also mentions that this system is not proof that more guns means less crime. However, I would think that the latter has more to do with deterring crime.\n \n Also, concerning what I said about the Nazis not invading, from this same website,\n \n \"In World War II, Hitler wanted the Swiss gold reserves and needed free communications and transit through Switzerland to supply Axis forces in the Mediterranean.

Virtually every home has a gun\" (Now that answers the questions about the inclusion of the non-full auto weapons, so 33% of households have guns)\n \n \"Thus, Handgun Control's assertion that all Swiss guns are registered is just plain wrong, and its claim that \"Switzerland and Israel strictly control handgun availability\" is more than a little inaccurate. \"\n \n \"Yet the only individuals who are \"restricted\" from buying handguns are children, the insane and ex-criminals.\"\n \n you can read at: http://www.asa-training.com/switzerland.html\n \n Now with respect to Ms. Brady.

   "Originally posted by MarxismIsMurder \n VOR, you need to keep reading further on that link you sent me. That 14% figure is due to the Swiss army being reduced from 625K to 400K. If the 625K figure is used, the percentage of households with full auto weapons jumps to 22%. Also, this figure is only for FULL AUTO weapons. What about semi-auto or single shot weapons? \n\n You're dodging the issue. I was addressing your claim that weapons ownership is mandatory. I'm showing that ownership of weapons is mandatory in only 14% of households because only 14% of Swiss households have a soldier in them. As for the 625K and 400k you said \"weapons ownership IS mandatory\" so I assumed you were talking about the present day situation and not how it used to be.\n \n \nOriginally posted by MarxismIsMurder \n Also, concerning what I said about the Nazis not invading, from this same website,\n \n \"In World War II, Hitler wanted the Swiss gold reserves and needed free communications and transit through Switzerland to supply Axis forces in the Mediterranean. But when military planners looked at Switzerland's well-armed citizenry, mountainous terrain, and civil defense fortifications, Switzerland lost its appeal as an invasion target.\"\n \n Also,\n \n \"The experience of Swiss history has made national independence and power virtually synonymous with an armed citizenry.\"\n \n And a few more tidbits...\n \"In a nation of six million people, there are at least two million guns, including 600,00 fully automatic assault rifles, half a million pistols, and numerous machine guns. Virtually every home has a gun\" (Now that answers the questions about the inclusion of the non-full auto weapons, so 33% of households have guns)\n Now you have me confused. First you have a quote that says that \"Virtually every home has a gun\" then you say 33% of homes have guns. \n \n \nOriginally posted by MarxismIsMurder \n \"Thus, Handgun Control's assertion that all Swiss guns are registered is just plain wrong, and its claim that \"Switzerland and Israel strictly control handgun availability\" is more than a little inaccurate. \"\n \n \"Yet the only individuals who are \"restricted\" from buying handguns are children, the insane and ex-criminals.\"\n \n you can read at: http://www.asa-training.com/switzerland.html\n \n The link you provide is a link to an article from American Rifleman. So you're getting your info about Switzerland straight from the NRA.\n \n \nOriginally posted by MarxismIsMurder \n Now with respect to Ms. Brady. Her father had been shot in the head, obviously she is going to react emotionally. I, like others, am still waiting for her to explain why law abiding citizens should not be allowed to have guns. Also, lets not overlook the fact that she bought her son a shotgun for his birthday. In other words, \"Gun control for thee, but not for me\"\n \n enough for now...\n\n Sarah Brady says that she is not opposed to law-abiding citizens owning guns. She says that she just wants to pass reasonable and sensible gun-control laws.",

   "What I've done is provide proof that Switzerland doesn't have very restrictive gun control laws as you claimed. At least thats not my idea of restrictive gun control. Also, it certainly doesn't support your claim that we need to ban guns! This link was from the web page that you referred me to. The fact that American Rifleman is affiliated with a group that you hate doesn't necessarily make the content untrue. If every time a website that refutes what you say is quoted and is immediately dismissed as somehow \"right wing\" or \"pro-NRA\" or whatever, then this debate is pointless. Also, this euphemism keeps coming up, \"reasonable and sensible gun-control laws.\" What exactly are \"reasonable and sensible gun contol laws?\" I see the label, but I never see whats inside. Can you give me an example of one of these laws that doesn't inhibit the law abiding citizen? Or even just one of these laws at all? Registration?--won't stop criminals. Licensing?--won't stop criminals. Trigger locks?--criminals don't use 'em. I don't think that Eric Harris or Dylan Klebold would have stopped to think: \"Gee, I can't slaughter all these people, my gun is registered!\" Also can you tell me what is wrong with the \"Eddie Eagle\" program? This is targeted at kids with the message: If you see a gun, don't touch, leave the area and go tell an adult! To me, that seems sensible, but I doubt that Ms. Brady would be willing to back it (in fact, I know she doesn't and to my knowledge, none of the confiscationists do). Why not? Because this program is affiliated with a group that she hates, the NRA. If she is truly concerned about safety, why wouldn't she be willing to work with the NRA? It seems that gun safety to her and other groups (i.e. Americans for Gun Safety) means no guns in the hands of private citizens, period. Also, if you feel you need to, go ahead and quote from one of their websites. It will be judged on content and not on origin.",

   "Actually dsa, the purpose of the car analogy was to take the anti-gunners' argument to its logical conclusion. The argument goes: \"since people have died from guns and we want to save lives, then we must ban guns.\" Well, doesn't it stand to reason that something that causes much more death and carnage than guns should also be banned? Now I'm learning that saving lives is not the driving force behind the anti gunners argument (incidentally, this is the admission that I had asked for a few posts ago and now am finally getting) but rather some perceived intent. The intent of my gun is whatever I intend to do with it, be it target shooting, hunting, putting a trigger lock on it and throwing away the key and keeping it for show, or self defense or defense of my family. I seriously hope that someone out there is not going to engage in an argument that I do not have a right to self defense! Yes, I could kill in self defense or defense of family but if that means that me or one of my loved ones could otherwise die then why is that wrong? Most often all that has to be done is someone brandishing a weapon to deter a crime and again, why is that wrong? If a gun is misused (by violating someone else's rights) by a criminal then they will be dealt with according to the law. They want to take away the guns of law abiding citizens who have never killed anyone and have no intention of killing anyone (except possibly self defense)all because of some perceived intent of the weapon? To me it seems more like an elitist distrust of good \"common\" people.",

   "\"...The right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" The operative phrase here is \"the people.\" \n Amendment 1 mentions \"the people\"\n Amendment 2 mentions \"the people\"\n Amendment 4 mentions \"the people\"\n Amendment 9 mentions \"the people\"\n Amendment 10 mentions \"the people\"\n Now, I have never heard even the most staunch supporter of the \"collective\" theory of the second amendment ever challenge the meaning of the phrase \"the people\" in amendments 1,4,9 and 10. Clearly, it refers to the individual. The phrase \"the people\" in the second amendment suddenly refers to the \"collective?\" I don't think that this is what the founders had in mind. The problem with anything \"collective\" (such as collective property in the Soviet Union) is that it belong to everyone at once in theory, but only to the government in practice. Thus it is not a genuine right. The second amendment was written to protect the citizenry against the tyranny of government. Those who support the notion that the second amendment refers to the national guard don't seem to realize that the national guard can be federalized and become an arm of the U.S. government. What good would that do against a tyrannical government? With regard to the militia, United States Code (USC) Title 10-Armed forces:\n a)\"The militia of the United States consists of all able bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32 under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are commissioned officers of the National Guard\"\n b)\"The classes of the militia are -- (1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and (2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or Naval Militia.\"\n Regarding the \"unorganized militia\" the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Presser v. Illinois that, \"It is undoubtedly true that all citizens capable of bearing arms constitute the reserved military force or reserve militia of the United States as well as of the States.\"\n \"And that the said constitution be never construed to authorize congress...to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping and bearing their own arms...\" -- Samuel Adams, delegate, First and Second Continental Congress.\n \"A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves... and include all men capable of bearing arms.\" --Richard Henry Lee, Senator, First Congress\n \"I ask, Sir, what is the militia, it is the whole people, except for a few public officials.\" -- George Mason, delegate, Constitutional Convention\n The collective theorists like to point to U.S. v. Miller but even this doesn't offer any support for the \"collective right\" nor does it mention the national guard. Even constitutional legal scholar Lawrence Tribe (not exactly a conservative in anyones book) admits this. Also, regarding U.S. v. Emerson, the Fifth Circuit concluded: \"we reject the collective rights and sophisticated collective rights models for interpreting the Second Amendment. We hold, consistent with Miller, that it protects the right of individuals, including those not actually a member of any militia or engaged in active military service or training, to privately possess and bear their own firearms, such as the pistol involved here, that are suitable as personal, individual weapons and are not of the general kind or type excluded by Miller.\"",

   "All excellent points. What did I say about collective rights in my post however? I merely said that unlike the rest of the constitution, the 2nd amendment is prefaced with \"well-regulated,\" which gives the entire amendment a whole different slant, IE, it opens it up to regulation. Nor did I mention US v. Miller, although no that you bring it up, Miller provides the precedent of banning specific types of handguns (in that case, sawed-off shotguns).\n \n Oh, and I don't know if the 2nd amendment was meant as a check against the federal govt.. It is as likely that it was meant to provide a \"back up army\", especially when you consider the 1791 Militia Act and the way it dealt with gun ownership.\n \n Oh, and Emerson was one of the most remarkably activist decisions in court history. I guess Stare Decisis means little to our pals in Texas. In terms of circuit court history, though, you have Emerson on one side and then the 7th circuit case of Quilici v.

   "With regard to the phrase \"well regulated militia\", it refers more to the readiness and ability than government authority to dictate what kind of arms the citizenry can possess. You are correct to point out that the citizen militia is to serve as a \"back up army\" for the defense of the country.

Yes, we would take up arms against a foreign invader that threatened our lives and liberty. But why should it be restricted to a foreign threat?

Second, we know just how much traction the gun control movement had in the late 1930s. I mean, it practically was the largest lobbying group in the country right? Hardly. This case wasn't activist in the slightest, it took the words \"well-regulated militia,\" observed that no well-regulated militia uses nor would ever need to use a sawed off shotgun. Hence, the govt. has the power to regulate it. Conservatives have an extremely annoying tendancy to label any court decision they dislike \"activist\" but half the time it isn't the case. Had the court ruled the other way, they would have created a right to gun ownership irrespective of the express limitations the constitution puts on it.

   "I see UNTRAINED gun-owners in that light sure\n \n \n I don't want to dwell on this, but what exactly is your implication? Anyone that owns a gun and doesn't have the \"proper\" training is a drunk? I don't own a gun but if someday I do, I will get training. Its the responsible thing to do and I'll do it not because I'm being forced by the government, but because it is in my self interest. If I misuse the gun, with or without proper training, I could be in some serious trouble.\n \n \nWell-regulated = Well-regulated. Communitative Property of mathamatics and logic (a=a, or if a=b, then b=a). It has nothing to do with what I or the founders thought.\n \n \n \n Cute, but original intent does matter. They wrote it and they wrote it for a reason. If it didn't matter, the constitution would be meaningless.\n \n \nI buy the living document stance more. E.G., the government can create an Air Force, despite the fact that the founders never envisioned that, because the constitution adopts to modern circumstances.\n \n \n \n No, the Air Force is part of the national defense. National defense is one of those powers originally delegated to the federal government by the people.\n \n \nthe right to an abortion, and the right to privacy\n \n \n correct. In fact, I've never understood those (primarily conservatives) who like to point out, \"there is no right to privacy in the constitution.\" They have not figured out that the constitution limits government, not people. They should read the fourth and the ninth. Hell, they should read the whole thing for once.\n \n \nbecause the constitution adopts to modern circumstances.\n \n \n Nobody will deny that there are times that the constitution might need to be changed \"to adopt modern circumstances\" but it has to be done via the amendment process that the founders took the time to outline. Not only is this the legal way but the democratic way. It cannot be done by judicial fiat.\n \n \nI am merely pointing out the hypocrisy of labeling decisions activists b/c they create rights not found in the constitution, yet saying even rights not enumerated in the constitution still exist and need to be protected.\n \n \n \n Again, the decisions I'm referring to as \"activist\" are those that are granting powers to the government that are not enumerated. Thats why I mentioned that any decision that DENIES the right to keep and bear arms is \"activist\" because thats equivalent to granting the government a power that is not enumerated. The Bill of Rights doesn't grant rights to government, only limits it, and grants rights to the people.\n \n \nWe need to balance the right to revolt against an unjust govt. with the problems created when everyone owns assualt rifles and bazookas\n \n \n what problems are those? The same problems we have now when people misuse firearms? It doesn't matter if its a bazooka or a single shot .22, if it is misused in a crime then the perp is dealt with harshly. Law abiding citizens are not going to misuse their firearms and those with criminal records are already banned from owning guns.\n \n \nI can come close. 1791 Militia act, mandated registration of firearms.\n \n \n \n I can't find anything in the Act that even remotely comes close to a federal registration database. If I am called in service to the country (which is what the Act was written for) and if my commanding officer wants to check my weapon and even wants to make note of what I have (which they can do) then fine. But, even this is only done at the state level. If I have not been called in service to the country then nobody is going to come to my door asking to check my weapons. But this is precisely what Shumer, Feinstein et al. are pushing for. Also, I've never heard the anti-gunners in the house or senate ever invoke this act to justify their agendas.\n \n With that, I give you the last word.",
