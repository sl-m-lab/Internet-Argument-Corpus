   "First of all, let me say that I am not some anti-porn crusader, I simply recognize its faults and problems and am trying to be a moderate thinker here.\n \n About Shaggydoo's first thesis:\n For the most part, the items he mentions to support his thesis are not relevant. In his last statement here he says that porn is a molester's instruction manual when really the molestation they experienced is, but porn isn't exactly helping any. On the other hand, the thesis itself probably isn't that far from the truth. To take a tangent- why do you think there is child porn? I think all of us here could agree that child porn is wrong, but is viewing it wrong? If so, (which, again, I think we can agree that it is) is it wrong simply because it's supporting people who do harmful things to children, or because viewing it is wrong in and of itself?\n I don't know if his claim is accurate or not, but I'll tell you this, I sure wouldn't be surprised if it was.\n \n \n Shaggydoo said:\n Thesis #2.\n \n \nQuote:\n * Individuals who view pornography are more likely to think of women in stereotype, as socially non-discriminating and eager to accommodate any and every sexual request.\n \n * Individuals who view pornography are more likely to have sexually callous attitudes and accept rape myths (that when a woman says \"no,\" she means \"yes.\")\n \n * Individuals who use pornography have increasingly hostile and aggressive sexual fantasies.\n\n \n To which snake spit said\n \n \nI find these statements to be baseless and groundless. How do you measure statistics such as this quantitatively?\n\n \n In fact, these statements are true. Check out any socioligy, psychology, or related textbook and they will discuss the many studies that have all found this information to be true.\n \n \n* Images affect attitudes and thinking, and images affect behavior and choices. \n\n \nEverything we do, see, and experience potentially has an influence on our behavior. This really says nothing.\n\n \n You are right that these things potentially influence our behavior, but that does not make this statement irrelevant. Despite its seemingly obvious nature, it is often denied that porn has this effect. Because of this, I think stating the normally obvious is relevant.\n \n \nDefine \"sex addict\". I would say that I like sex, on a fairly regular basis...am I addicted? Oh no, not another 12 step program to go through. \n\n Are you denying that there are sex addicts and sex addiction? I bet you have a drink now and then too. Are you an alcoholic then? No? Then does that mean that no such thing exists?\n \n \n* UNICEF estimates that one million children are forced into prostitution or used to produce pornography each year. Many are handed over (or sold) by their families driven by the extremes of poverty....The Internet also has given dealers in child pornography a far bigger audience--and anonymity. \n\n \nThe internet has also proven to be a valuable tool to catch child pornographers, and others invloved in the exploitation of children.\n\n \n You're both right. Yes, the internet has been used to catch some of these people, but there is the good possibility there wouldn't be so many people to catch without the accessability of child porn on the internet. Here's the rub: this is not to say that I think the internet is evil or something. It is very difficult to crack down these sites is all. I think that this was more of a general observation, but an important one to make.\n \n \n* We now have no legal means to protect children from sexually explicit material on the Internet. The door has been flung open wide for pornographers and sexual predators.\n\n \nSure you do.\n 1. Don't have a computer.\n 2. Don't have the internet.\n 3. Don't allow your children to use internet or computer.\n 4. Monitor what you children do on the computer.\n 5. Block access to adult sites and chat rooms.\n 6. Educate your children about potential dangers, so that they can help protect themselves. \n 7. Educate yourself, so you can protect your children.\n -the list could go on for pages...all legal too.\n\n Snakespit- You knew what he meant by \"legal means\" and that wasn't it. It is not that we have NO legal means to do this, it is that it is very limited. This is mostly due to the fact (as mentioned above) that it is difficult to catch these people on the internet, but, on the other hand (as Tevye would say) it is not as if there isn't more we can do.",

I would not advise taking the child molestation issue any further tho, the readers here do not want to talk about it. I think the ones that have children are turned cold inside from the mention of it . Because NO child is safe from molestation, and it tears the heart out of those parents to even discuss it. It just brings it all too close to their world I think, and rightfully so....\n \n Porn , like religion, can be debated until the milk cows come home with their teats dragging in the dirt. I will not go there. My philosphy on ANY aspect of human vices, be it religion or porn, is what is the total sum of the EFFECT it produces on people. If one would take a FACTUAL and current poll on just where EACH and every porn actor's ( not owner /producer) quality of moral, ethical and personal life is at TODAY, I really dont think it could be summed up as a role model career.

   "MMMM, A lot of different viewpoints on this late night topic :) \n \n Yes, I agree with the opinion that the useage of porn , guns, candy, is only as bad as the person wants to make it. But as I stated above, I feel it is the total outcome from the USE of ANY product, that determines its total value, that outcome being good or bad for the person/s. JMO..\n \n I do not think I would be going out on a limb here to say , that the porn industry has a LOT of drug users. A LOT of the stars, do porn, to be able to afford their expensive habit. More than a few have committed suicide, not being able to deal with the combination of drug use, and the daily commercial use of their bodies. The emotional balance of doing what they do daily for a living, then having to go home and trying to fit that mode of thinking in to a healthy physical intimate relationship with a wife ,husband, G/F,B/F, must take a mind of steel OR one of mush. This is not a TOTALLY true scenario of the whole porn industry though, because some of those stars really get in to , what they do best,...\n \n \n A steady diet of porn to a young person that has not  already been educated about human sexuality in a \" normal \" environment ( loving , caring , relationships) and that has not developed a healthy attitude about sex, CAN be misaligned greatly on their outlook on sex. Many male teens ( and even adult males) that are hooked on net or book porn, get a jaded view of the female gender, thinking females conduct themselves in the real world , like the porn stars do. It is not front page news of course, but many marriages are broken up, because the husband is hooked on porn, and neglects the missus ....\n \n \n Does anyone REALLY know how many young people run away from home, or head to Hollywood looking to get in the movies with the famous people , yet they end up in films where there is no clothing budget at all ? And , that once a person makes it big ( no pun intended) in porn, and then tries to cross over in to main stream Hollywood movie acting, the top Hollywood producers never take them serious, so they end up in \"C\" type movies ? ...\n \n And one other issue, that points to the way our society feels about porn. Did you know that if a search warrant is delivered on ones home, and the police find xxx videos/dvd's. mags in it, that the prosecutors will use that as evidence to support their character assassination of the homeowner ? I watched that one on court TV. :) ...\n \n So , my opinion is, when I use my total summation theory, porn as a whole product is more harmful in our society . And that harm , outweighs any positive effects produced from it. all jmo",

   "I think Greg makes some interesting points, and I'd have to agree with him somewhat.\n \n A few too many sweeping generalizations for my liking. \n \n I'm pretty sure not everyone in porn is a drug addict, forced into it, etc.... That's simply a stereotype, I would guess drug addicts are in the minority. You're not much good to anyone when you're an addict. \n \n Their \"lifestyle\" may not be mom, dad, two kids and white picket fence, but IMHO, that has no bearing on whether they're happy or enjoy life, they're just different than you and I. To each his own.\n \n I agree that that too much porn is harmful, it can affect how teens view sex, and it can affect marriages. That's the point that it crosses over into abuse/addiction though.\n \n If the only thing you've got going in your court case is to try and attack someone's character using a couple of COMPLETELY LEGAL porn mags or videos, your case SUCKS. I'd bet that around 50% of households have some form of porn in them, especially where any male between the ages of 18-45 resides. I heard they found porn mags in Michael Jackson's home - I was surprised, that's about the most normal thing I've ever heard about him.\n \n I'm not sure that the summation of porn's value is negative. I suppose it likely is somewhat negative. So are about 10,000 other things though, it all depends how they're used. \n \n What are your thoughts on the affect of video games on our society? Pretty scary comparison IMHO if you just want to talk about negative value.\n \n Waxy",

   "1. Pornography facilitates child molestation.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n * It is used to instruct the child victims, reduce their natural inhibitions, and it is used to prepare and arouse the perpetrator.\n \n \n \n * 87% of convicted molesters of girls, and 77% of convicted molesters of boys, admit to the use of pornography, most often in the commission of their crimes.\n \n * One in three American girls and 1 in 5-7 American boys will be sexually molested by the age of 18.\n \n * An average serial child molester has between 360-380 victims in his lifetime.\n \n * One of the most popular pornographic video series in America, entitled \"Taboo,\" is based upon incest.\n \n * More and more media reports tell of the tragic exploitation of innocent children. Even more tragic is the rise of not only child victims, but of child perpetrators. Pornography is their instruction manual.\n \n \n \n \n 2. Pornography shapes attitudes, behaviors and values.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n * Individuals who view pornography are more likely to think of women in stereotype, as socially non-discriminating and eager to accommodate any and every sexual request.\n \n \n \n * Individuals who view pornography are more likely to have sexually callous attitudes and accept rape myths (that when a woman says \"no,\" she means \"yes.\")\n \n * Individuals who use pornography have increasingly hostile and aggressive sexual fantasies. \n \n * Individuals who use pornography are less likely to convict for a rape, and less likely to give a harsh sentence to a rapist if in fact convicted. Conversely, individuals who do not use pornography are more likely to convict an accused rapist.\n \n * Areas with pornography outlets and sexually oriented businesses experience significantly higher sexual offenses and property crimes than areas without such businesses.\n \n * Pornography has a direct role in the transmission and encouragement of sexually transmitted diseases. Many \"adult\" bookstores derive 75% of their income from peep show booths, with \"glory holes\" to provide anonymous sexual encounters.\n \n * Clinical research shows that pornographic images create chemically encoded messages on the brain that can remain through adulthood. Human memory is formed in part by the release of the chemical epinephrine which, upon emotional arousal, leaves behind an imprint on the brain.**\n \n * Advertisers know how compelling images are, especially to children, and pornographers do, too. Advertisers don't spend billions of dollars each year for nothing. In Superbowls 29 and 30, companies paid 1.3 million dollars for a 30-second shot at your attention on the way to the kitchen or bathroom.**\n \n * Images affect attitudes and thinking, and images affect behavior and choices.\n \n \n \n \n 3. Pornography has a compulsive or addictive nature. Four stages of viewing pornography following initial exposure are:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n * Addiction - The desire and need to keep coming back for pornographic images.\n \n \n \n * Escalation - The need for more explicit, rougher, and more deviant images for the same sexual effect.\n \n * Desensitization - Materiel once viewed as shocking or taboo is seen as acceptable or commonplace.\n \n * Acting out - The tendency to perform the behaviors viewed, including exhibitionism, sadistic/masochistic sex, group sex, rape, or sex with minor children. \n \n * Dr. Victor Cline, clinical psychologist at the University of Utah, said that pornography is the gateway drug to sexual addiction.\"\n \n * In a study of 932 sex addicts, 90% of the men and 77% of the women indicated that pornography played a significant role in their addiction.\n \n \n \n \n B. Internet pornography is both prevalent and easily accessible by children.\n \n \n \n \n \n * Teens use the Internet an average of 8.5 hours per week for chatting and e-mailing, compared to 1.8 hours spent using it for school work.\n \n \n \n * An estimated 18.8 million kids under 18-years-old have access to home computers.\n \n * \"Adult\" entertainment on the Internet is the third largest sector of sales, surpassed only by computer products and travel.\n \n * Playboy's web site, which offers free teaser shots of its Playmates, averages 5 million hits per day.\n \n * After the Supreme Court overturned the indecency provisions of the Communications Decency Act, Penthouse posted the following statement on its web site: \"With these words, the Supreme Court struck a blow for Liberty, and cleared the way for Penthouse to build the Ultimate Empire of Sex on the Internet...The Supreme Court has defended your right to Freedom of Sexual Expression on the Internet...Now we at Penthouse will do our part to deliver it!\"\n \n * In August, 1997, there were 72,000 sexually explicit sites on the Internet, and an estimated 266 new porn sites every day.\n \n * The vast majority of Americans (94%) believe a ban on Internet pornography should be legal. \n \n * UNICEF estimates that one million children are forced into prostitution or used to produce pornography each year. Many are handed over (or sold) by their families driven by the extremes of poverty....The Internet also has given dealers in child pornography a far bigger audience--and anonymity.\n \n * We now have no legal means to protect children from sexually explicit material on the Internet. The door has been flung open wide for pornographers and sexual predators.\n \n \n http://www.levelbest.com/design/sit...rnisharmful.htm\n\n \n \n \n One of the most hideous serial killers would undoubtedly have to be the sexual killer. Many specialists, including Douglas (1996) have agreed that the most crucial factor in the development of the serial rapist or killer is the role of fantasy. It has been suggested that the escalation from fantasy to reality in these instances, can be attributed to pornography. In response I would tend to agree, for pornography tends to build on the natural inner desires that exist within us all. The desire to have sexual intercourse is dominant in all males. The action of penetration brings on a sense of triumph and conquest . The only difference here is that these killers have not had the opportunity to learn intimacy due to childhood restraints, and they substitute intimacy with control (which they obtain by inflicting bodily harm to the other(the equivalent to the penetrating conquest) to counteract their inner desires for a mate. As Dr. Richard G. Rappart, a forensic psychiatrist, writes that the mode of death is one where factors indicate that the victim has meaning to the killer and that the intimacy of the murderous act is part of a close bond between himself and the victim formed in the killers fantasy and delusions. A study by Samuel Yochelson and Stanton Samenow (1988) pointed out that a high proportion of serial killers are 'highly sexed' in childhood, and have been known to look into bathrooms through keyholes on females undressing, or initiated sexual games - sometimes amounting to rape - with girls at school.\n \n http://www.uplink.com.au/lawlibrary/Documents/Docs/Doc5.html",

When people are addicted to candy bars, they're more addicted to the act of eating them than the chemicals in the products themselves.\n \n Certainly, the industry supporting candy bars is more benign than the porn industry, although some cocoa farmers in developing countries might disagree.\n \n As I said, I've got some arguments to make WRT specific points in the post, but I'll write those later.",

   "* Individuals who view pornography are more likely to think of women in stereotype, as socially non-discriminating and eager to accommodate any and every sexual request.\n \n * Individuals who view pornography are more likely to have sexually callous attitudes and accept rape myths (that when a woman says \"no,\" she means \"yes.\")\n \n * Individuals who use pornography have increasingly hostile and aggressive sexual fantasies.\n\n \n The exact same applies to each and every James Bond movie and (at my estimate) the majority of Hollywood action movies.",
