   "Well,if god was going to help us,Bush would not have been elected in the first place.It might take an act of god to fix the mess we are in though.\n\n \n Typical Liberal, nothing but doom and gloom! LOL\n \n \nBush has no energy policies to speak of,other than drilling for more oil.\n\n \n If I'm not mistaken, he has authorized funds for alternative fuels, but until those come to fruition, what else is he supposed to do? There is little that is more important now than to become independent from Middle East oil. It is my dying wish to see them pour oil on their cereal as we thumb our collective noses at them\n \n \nHe has not addressed the problem of record deficits,which he created.\n\n \n I've often said that he has spent way too much money, but if you are one of those who actually thinks cutting taxes resulted in such a defecit, you are truly mistaken.\n \n \n \nHe put a band-aid on health care costs.\n\n \n Price controls don't work, so what else is he to do? You people have been so conned by the Democrats into thinking that a politician can work miracles. If I'm not mistaken, Clinton was in office for 8 years and medical costs did not go down, so are the current problems Bush's fault? Bush wants to get rid of the frivolous lawsuits that cause the costs to skyrocket...aaaahhhhh but taking away the little guys shot at sticking it to a rich doctor is going a little too far for you, huh? And yeah, I know, 45 million people don't have insurance...blah blah blah. Yep, Clinton had EVERYONE insured and suddenly, mere minutes after Bush was sworn in, MILLIONS lost it. DAMN THAT MAN\n \n \nHe's done very little to create new jobs that were lost since he was elected.\n\n \n GEEEEEEEEEEEZ, do you people EVER get tired of saying that? Because we sure do get tired of hearing it. If I'm not mistaken, I heard that we lost a huge number of jobs following 9-11 and the economy took a good hit. Bush's fault, right? Secondly, I don't know about you, but no President ever got me a job and no President ever got me fired, either. If it was that easy, every President would just say that everyone is hired and there would be no unemployment. The unemployment rate is rather low now, I think 5.4 or somewhere right around there, and I believe that is lower than when Clinton left office\n \n \nAre any of these problems being addressed by a man of substance,who is capable of thinking through any sort of problem?\n\n \n Don't know about the world YOU live in, but on planet Earth, things don't just happen overnight. The economy IS coming back despite your, and the Democrats, panicked lies trying to convince people that it isn't. To admit such would completely destroy your philosophy, and since you all would rather be right than have what's best for the country, you will continue looking for the worst whenever a Republican is in office. I tell you what, let's make a deal here and now that should Kery win, we note for the record the statistics the day he takes office...you know, the ones you guys pull out when it's convenient. We'll note unemployment, homeless, uninsured and all the others, then you can spin it all to your liking.\n \n \n \n He is good at taking advice though.Isn't that why we are in Iraq?It just happened to be bad advice,and quite costly.\n \n \n HMMMMMMMMMMMMm then would you say that YOUR side also has bad advice?

We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.\" - President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998\n \n Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a great\n deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use\n nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest\n security threat we face.\" - Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998\n \n \"He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten\n time since 1983.\" - Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb,\n 18, 1998\n \n \"[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S.\n Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate,\n air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively\n to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass\n destruction programs.\" - Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin(D-MI) Tom Daschle (D-SD), John Kerry( D - MA), and others Oct. ,1998\n \n \"Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass\n destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and\n he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.\" - Rep. Nancy\n Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998\n \n \"Hussein has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies.\" - Madeline Albright, Clinton\n Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999\n \n \"There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein has invigorated his weapons \n programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs\n continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam \n continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a\n licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the\n United States and our allies.\" - Letter to President Bush, Signed by\n Sen Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, December 5, 2001\n \n \"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and\n threat to the peace and stability of the region He has ignored the mandated of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the\n means of delivering them.\" - Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002\n \n \"We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical\n weapons throughout his country.\" - Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002\n \n \"Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to\n deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam\n is in power.\" - Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002\n \n \"We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and\n developing weapons of mass destruction.\" - Sen.

Robert Byrd(D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002\n \n \"I will be voting to give the President of the United States the\n authority to use force-- if necessary-- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I\n believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a\n real and grave threat to our security.\" - Sen.

This he has\n refused to do\" - Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002\n \n \"In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show\n that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological\n weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has\n also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda \n members. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will \n continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.\" - Sen. Hillary Clinton (D,\n NY),Oct 10, 2002\n \n \"We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that\n Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction.\" - Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), Dec. 8, 2002\n \n \"Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal,\n murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a\n particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to\n miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to\n his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass\n destruction.

Kerry is a terrible candidate. But then again so is Bush. Many of the attacks on Kerry EASILY apply to Bush. I attack the one sidedness of republicans. You attack Kerry for reasons people aren't voting for Bush. The fact that you people can't see the problem is disturbing, but quite enlightening as to why this country is no longer a real democracy but a plutocracy. I don't like either candidate, and Nader can't win. So, if you'd like to back your claim up, which I doubt you can, just like Jim can't back any of his claims up, please, show me where I defend Kerry to the death. \n \n \n\n The only time you will say the Democrats are as guilty as Republicans is when you can't find a way to spin the negatives the Democrats are guilty of.\n\n \n I have stated I don't like either party, and that Republicans are not conservatives. Besides, both are bad, and I have stated in a perfect world, everyone would run independent. \n \n \n \nYou could pull up perhaps MORE stupid comments made by Gore than Quayle.\n\n \n That is questionable.

Please, if you can, which I know you will fail utterly at, show me where my so called hate is driving my opinions.\n \n As for you jim, who is the one failing 8 times and fleeing?

The attacks are directed because they are a hypocritical stance that Bush and his supporters are taking, aka the flip flopping issue on Kerry.

Oh yes, everyone who disagrees with the rank and file notions of the Republican party is a liberal. Even if they support state's rights, small government, conservative fiscal policies, strong global alliances, so on an so forth. Therefore, all real conservatives are liberals according to the Republican definition of a liberal. This isn't something new.

As for flip flopping, Bush does it just, if not more, then Kerry. I don't attack Bush on flip flopping unless someone attacks Kerry. How can reason A apply to Kerry and not apply to Bush? People who attack one or the other for flip flopping without attacking BOTH are inconsistant hypocrites. How is flip flopping even a real issue aganist Kerry when Bush does it himself? Obviously, you won't understand a thing I just said. As for war record, the SVBTs are flaming liars being proven wrong by TIME, Newsweek and military records. Also, a few Bush voting vets have come out aganist the SVBT. That says far more then you or they ever will. As for liberal record, much of the military one easily applies to Cheney, the main selling point of Bush's campagin aganist Kerry. I don't like Kerry, I don't like Bush, and if either came to my house, I'd sic attack dogs on both of them. \n \n \nWHEN and IF you do all this, then I will believe you are what you keep claiming you are...until then, I consider you to be a whacked out Liberal with no spine.\n\n \n You consider McCain to be a liberal.

He hasn't screwed up every business venture he got into, he didn't invade a country for premises that were ulimtely false, he didn't drive the deficit and debt sky high, he didn't alienate virtually the entire world, he didn't go back on his presidential campagin promises, he didn't do alot of bad things Bush did.

Quayle was a target because he made himselt out to be a idiot for 4 years in the limelight. That;s not anyone's fault but his own. \n \n \n\n Well, nice to see you give so much benefit of the doubt to a Liberal...seems like a defense to me.\n\n \n Um, it's a technicality.

He has nowhere near the responsibilities as a President. John Kerry doesn't suggest to the country that we invade countries. John Kerry doesn't sign all the bills. John Kerry doesn't command 280 million people. John Kerry has had one of the worst Senate records of all time. If he can't even do something productive in the Senate (doesn't even attend 80% of the votes), how in the hell is he going to manage 280 million people and also fight the war on terror worldwide? I seriously doubt he has that capability to do that, and John Edwards sure as hell is not going to help him out, unless it's suing Saudi Arabia or something involving lawsuits.

So comparing him to a President like that is rather counter-intuitive because there is NO comparison.\n \n It's also rather amusing that you said he didn't go to war on false premises. He voted and defended his vote to go to war numerous time!!! Why don't you criticize Kerry for voting for war? He voted for the war with the same information that Bush had. Why only criticize Bush? BECAUSE YOU'RE A HYPOCRITE!!\n \n It seems like you blame everything that happens wrong in the US on the President, but you don't give any credit for the good stuff to the President. Why? Where is the credit for removing Saddam, for creating 1.8 million jobs in the last year, for having the lowest unemployment rate in years, having the lowest crime rate in I think 20 years, etc? Where is the credit? Oh, I forgot...you only defend Kerry and slam Bush on anything!!",

   "That doesn't mean I like Kerry. The attacks are directed because they are a hypocritical stance that Bush and his supporters are taking, aka the flip flopping issue on Kerry. Bush is just as much of a flip flopper, and I have no problem hitting you back with the same argument.\n\n \n LMAO, okay, then why don't your posts reflect the flip flops of Kerry as well? In all your divine wisdom and being above it all, you should be acting as such, showing us ALL the error of our ways, but oh no, you choose to only bash Bush. C'mon boy, we've unmasked you. You ARE a Liberal hiding behind the skirts of someone who claims to be fair. Pack it up\n \n \nLiberal? Oh yes, everyone who disagrees with the rank and file notions of the Republican party is a liberal. Even if they support state's rights, small government, conservative fiscal policies, strong global alliances, so on an so forth. Therefore, all real conservatives are liberals according to the Republican definition of a liberal. This isn't something new. Republicans PRETENDING to be conservatives usually have a hard time when actual conservatives question them and grill them. \n \n \n Dude, I think your delusional. You wish you were a Conservative but will never grow up to be one, so you hide in your safe world where YOU are the king and the rest of us are all imbiciles (that means dummies)\n \n \n \nLack of decisivess? yeah, but I'd rather have a president who thinks before he acts.\n\n \n Okay, then vote for Bush because Kerry, much like Gore, can't decide on who he is. Don't you think a politician, IF he is concerned with the country and not his own glorification, would just come out and say who he is and what he believes so that we can decide on who to vote for? Kerry can't make up his mind, he's too busy following the polls to tell us who he really is..oh yeah, that's what I want leading us.\n \n \nAs for liberal record, much of the military one easily applies to Cheney, the main selling point of Bush's campagin aganist Kerry.\n\n \n Just like a kid who has a new toy, you can't let it go. You keep harping on this and several have blown you to pieces about it, so move on to the REST of his record..you ARE fair, right? So quit harpinig on one little aspect of his record.\n \n \nYou consider McCain to be a liberal. If anything, you are a whacked out liberal republican pretending to be a conservative. \n \n \n LMAO, I think you are in love with McCain, I can just imagine your eyes sparkling and little hearts popping out of your head at the sound of his name. You worship him because you are a good little Liberal and think it was a great victory to get him on your side\n \n \nA good reason to vote for Kerry is to get rid of Bush because he gives conservatism a bad name. \n \n \n That's good sound logic LOL Any TRUE Conservative would not want someone like Kerry, ESPECIALLY just because Bush is not as Conservative as we would have hoped. Therefore, you ARE a Liberal!\n \n \nBecause...did you even read what I said? \n \n \n You bet I did, and I don't see a mature response..just a \"because\". I'm seeing \"deer in the headlight\" eyes on THAT one LMAO\n \n \n \nA FEW? How about several THOUSAND? \n \n \n I could sit back and just let you rant and not say a word, you make my point better than I ever could. YOU were the one that attacked Quayle for no reason whatsoever. I pointed out that Gore was a complete idiot, and all you can do is rally behind Gore and give me links to stuff on Quayle. You are a Hypocrite to the umpth degree\n \n \nAre you seriously voting for Bush after saying that? \n \n \n You betcha I am and I hope it keeps you up at night too! LOL\n \n \nGore's pretty dumb, but not as dumb as quayle. Quayle was a target because he made himselt out to be a idiot for 4 years in the limelight. That;s not anyone's fault but his own. \n \n \n Wrong again, you're on quite a streak there aren't you? LOL It was the press and we all know it. And there ya go again, can't say anything bad about a Liberal without bringing in a Conservative\n \n \nUm, it's a technicality. If Gore WAS a inspiration for 2 movies, he would be correct. A few implies more then one. so therefore 2 would make him correct. \n\n \n ROTFLMAO You're killing me...kookoo, kookoo\n \n \nNo, but the attack that he didn't is quite false. He didn't invent the internet, and that comment that he did is a lie.\n\n \n Since you are so fair and apt to bring up things from the past, where do you stand then on the quote by Gingrich used by the whacked out Liberals to scare an entire voting block..remember? the one about medicare rotting on the vine.

   "Bush left the country for the first time after he was elected. That is downright sad. \n\n \n That may have mattered 100 years ago. We have technology today that allows us to see what's going on around the world without actually going there. Especially going there as an American, carefully shielded by our foriegn hosts to see only what they want us to see.\n \n \n \n \n Yes, and it's quite sad. He may have done more things, but he has certainly failed far more as well as commit very questionable acts. If he was watching them, he wasn't watching well. He pretty much abandoned most of what his father did and believed. \n\n \n One of the things he may have abandoned that his father did was to meekly go along with the UN (not taking Saddam OUT in 91.) That's one of the great things about fathers - a son can learn from his father's MISTAKES as well. Fathers....hmmm, who was it, in the late 80's, in response to a somewhat immoral TV program called Murphy Brown, (tame by today's standards) that said this type of program cheapens our perception of the importance of fathers??? Why, it was DAN QUAYLE!!!!!! That was one of his first, one of the most widely publicized, one of the most scoffed at by the mainstream media, the same mainstream media that now has a little competition that it didn't have in those days. (Fox news, the internet, and talk radio) They still have a little trouble with their perception of what they can and can't get away with today, as opposed to 15 years ago. (ask Dan Rather) \n \n \n \n \n They just compile them, Quayle said them. There's a difference. A few thousand utterly retarded sayings is a good standard in which to judge a candidate's intellect and knowledg.e \n\n \n And you seem to quickly accept what they say as proof. You have completely different standards of \"proof\", depending on whether you're on the giving or recieving end. After Bush/Quayle won the election in spite of the mainstream presses' constant questioning of Quayle's \"experience, and Quayles soon after \"Murphy Brown\" comments, the Democrat machine was zeroed in on Quayle so hard, they probably documented the sound of every bodily function in every building Quayle ever occupied. It's a good thing there isn't much compiling going on of many of our senile, lifetime Senators blunders. Robert Byrd and Ted Kennedy immediately come to mind.\n \n \n \n \n Doesn't change the fact that he said them. Regardless of who read them, Quayle is arguably the #1 stupid saying holder of American politicans. \n\n \n See above. \n \n \n \n \nThat wouldn't be me though.

Apparently YOUR logic is faulty. 1 day is the uprising and let's ignore those 11 years of fighting. \n \n \nI'm definitely not running from you or conceding defeat. You happen to be one of the few people on this board who think that if they get in the last word, they win. How silly can one get?\n\n \n You're the one who can't answer the questions. You're the one who can't give details. You're the one who thinks that 1 day is the uprising that those 30 years aganist the French didn't exist. You're running away.

Great contradiction in your post. First, Republicans are not Conservatives. Then, Republicans are disregarding their Conservative notions?\n\n \n It's not to the intelligent. Most, if not all Republicans PRETEND to be conservatives, and then disregard the notions. They say they are, yet disregard what they say they follow. It's not my fault you don't understand the idea of using a false ideology to suit a party's alleged needs. \n \n \nThen you say that both are bad (Republicans and Conservatives), \n\n \n I didn't say conservatives are bad.

That's stupid. As for productive, what do you consider productive? As for Bush, I don't see him going after terror. I see him helping recruit terrorists withotu reducing their ability to obtain WMD, and failing to secure our borders, ports, Nuclear plants and water plants. \n \n \nWhy don't you criticize Kerry for voting for war?\n\n \n Because support the war for several reasons, but none of the ones Bush did. kKerry didn't vote for the war on all of the reasons Bush did. \n \n \nHe voted for the war with the same information that Bush had. \n\n \n That's a damn lie. A report just leaked out showing that Iraq had no wmd before we went to war. Also Bush disregarding numerous sources and reports sying that his reasons were not valid. None of that was shown to the senate. \n \n \nbut you don't give any credit for the good stuff to the President.\n\n \n What good stuff? Besides the Social Security plan...I don't see much.

He's enacted socialist measure one after another, he's sent terror levels to their highest, need I go on? \n \n \nWhere is the credit for removing Saddam\n\n \n I didn't say he was wrong for doing that. However, the logic in removing Saddam applies to our allies as well. Something many like you refuse to admit.

That would be hypocritical. \n \n \nfor creating 1.8 million jobs in the last year\n\n \n after losing several million, at least 1.2 million which are unaccounted for because of leaving the seeking pool.

McCain, Bush Sr, and Cheney to name a few have all supporting axing programs Kerry has voted the same on as well. Heck, Cheney may have wanted to cut more programs then Kerry. Attacking Kerry without attacking your own party on the military is hypocritical. \n \n \n\n so move on to the REST of his record..you ARE fair, right? So quit harpinig on one little aspect of his record.\n\n \n The rest of his record is boring. while he has supported cutting intelligence, he has supporting increases in human intelligence, arguably the #1 key to breaking the CELL theory developed by the CIA. We have relied on cold intelligence and we are paying the price for it. The Israels have shown that human intel is far more useful in breaking down terrorism then technological intel has. As for the taxes bs, if we use that logic, Bush has supported raising taxes at least 67 times as well. \n \n \n \n LMAO, I think you are in love with McCain, I can just imagine your eyes sparkling and little hearts popping out of your head at the sound of his name. You worship him because you are a good little Liberal and think it was a great victory to get him on your side\n\n \n McCain is argubly the most conservative member in Congress. He comes from a conservative family, in a heavy conservative state and has supported conservative notions time and time again. You don't like him because he shows that your party is pretending. \n \n \n \n That's good sound logic LOL Any TRUE Conservative would not want someone like Kerry, ESPECIALLY just because Bush is not as Conservative as we would have hoped. Therefore, you ARE a Liberal!\n\n \n Kerry is a douchebag, but Bush is damaging conservatism. Any true conservative would want to preserve their ideology, and kick out anyone who is causing possibly irreversable damage to it. Also, showing that Kerry as a liberal is not beneficial to America, it causes a push for real conservatism back into the Whitehouse further consolidating it's power. Therefore you're logic is not only childish, but it is faulty. I know people who are voting Bush because they know he will cause the country to vote liberal next election and concievlably damage what people believ eto be conservatism for years. It makes logical sense. \n \n \n\n I could sit back and just let you rant and not say a word, you make my point better than I ever could. YOU were the one that attacked Quayle for no reason whatsoever.\n\n \n Um no. People are attacking Kerry for his missayings, and therefore a reason not to vote for him.

As for a hypocrite, I don't defend that Gore is a idiot. Therefore your claim is a false. \n \n \n\n You betcha I am and I hope it keeps you up at night too! LOL\n\n \n Another good reason to vote Kerry. I don't want to raise your overall IQ level by joining you in who you vote for. \n \n \n\n Wrong again, you're on quite a streak there aren't you? LOL It was the press and we all know it. And there ya go again, can't say anything bad about a Liberal without bringing in a Conservative\n\n \n I didn't bring in any conservative. Blame the press, that is the most childish answer I have ever heard of it. It ignores the conservative notion of self responsibilty. You made the dumb comment so take responsibility for it. Don't blame the media for your own incompetence. \n \n \n\n ROTFLMAO You're killing me...kookoo, kookoo\n\n \n Apparently properly using the english language is something you find amusing.

Scare tactics should be removed from politics as a whole because they are usually false and taken out of context. Nither the dems or the repubs are good for America.

We've got the lowest active force today that we've had since before Korea. I've eliminated 70,000 civilian jobs in the last 18 months out of the Pentagon. I've closed or terminated 81 programs. We're shutting down 300 military bases worldwide. It's a massive reduction already underway.\" [Source: Cheney on ABC's \"This Week,\" 9/29/91] \n \n \n Cheney on shutting down F-14D production:\"What I recommended to the Committee was that we shut down the new F-14D production line, which will save almost $2.5 billion...\" [Source: Newsday, 2/5/91; Cheney testimony to House Armed Services Committee, 7/13/89] \n \n \n Cheney cutting B-2 bombers by 45%: \"Defense Secretary Richard Cheney announced a cutback... of nearly 45 percent in the administration's B-2 Stealth bomber program, from 132 airplanes to 75.\" [Source: Boston Globe, 4/27/90] \n \n \n Cheney forcing AH-64 Apache cuts: \"This is just a list of some of the programs that I've recommended termination: the V-22 Osprey, the F-14D, the Army Helicopter Improvement Program, Phoenix missile, F-15E, the Apache helicopter, the M1 tank, et cetera.\" [Source: Cheney testimony, Senate Appropriations Committee, Defense Subcommittee, 6/12/90] \n \n \"The Army, as I indicated in my earlier testimony, recommended to me that we keep a robust Apache helicopter program going forward, AH-64...I forced the Army to make choices...So I recommended that we cancel the AH-64 program two years out.\" [Source: Cheney testimony, House Armed Services Committee, 7/13/89] \n \n \n Cheney cutting off F-13 program: \"Cheney signed off on the fiscal 1991 recisions on Jan. 7, more than a week before the start of the war with Iraq. The decision to cut off F-14 remanufacture - modernizing F-14As into Ds - is consistent with what sources said is an apparent Cheney fiscal 1992 budget decision to turn down the Navy's request for new F-14D procurement, while supporting funding for an upgraded F/A-18 with increased strike capability. F-14 funds recissions were from the procurement account, sources said.\" \n \n \n Cheney on ending F-15 production: \"But the overall message brought out by Cheney on Wednesday was that the industry will face cutbacks through the mid-1990s...The Pentagon plan includes an end to production of the Grumman F-14 and McDonnell F-15 jet fighters, both of which have significant content in California, including radars built by Hughes.\" [Source: Los Angeles Times, 1/30/92] \n \n \n More importantly, as we look to the future of our intelligence community and our nations national security, the President's nominee to head the intelligence community has consistently pushed to cut our intelligence budget. Just last month the Washington Post reported that Rep. Porter Goss proposed intelligence cuts larger than anything Kerry ever supported - and Goss's cuts targeted human intelligence: \"But the cuts Goss supported are larger than those proposed by Kerry and specifically targeted the \"human intelligence\" that has recently been found lacking. The recent report by the commission probing the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks called for more spending on human intelligence.\" [Source: Washington Post, 8/24/04]\n\n \n \n\n How convenient! LOL Being so superior in your knowledge than the rest of us, yet you dismiss the rest of Kerry's record as being boring?\n\n \n It is boring. He hasn't done much in terms of flare, but cosponsred/sponsored at least 67 different bills. None of which have serious flare. \n \n \nLMAO Please enlighten us Mr. Politico, and tell us ALL about Kerry's record, I promise I won't be bored. You just picked one little vote, which I have no doubt is debatable, and leave us wanting more\n\n \n Let's see you do the research for once. Pick one of his bills and let's go. I have the list of his 67 co/sponsored bills. Let's see you put some effort into actually researching instead of pulling **** out of your butt. \n \n \n\n Then why doesn't McCain switch to Libertarian then and stop begging for favor from the Democrats.\n\n \n Who said he's begging? I don't see him begging. IF anything, it's the dems begging HIM. As for libertain, McCain wouldn't fit. Liberterians are pro almost all forms of freedom, something McCain wouldn't fit into. Do you even know what libertain MEANS? Oh wait, you don't. \n \n \nYou really can't be saying that JUST because Bush isn't a \"REAL\" Conservative, that he would, in all his Conservatism, run to the Democrats?\n\n \n That didn't even make sense. He's not running to the democrats. Where did you get that notion? Bush is not a conservative. He's a republican, and has supported liberal and socialist policies time and time again while shirking from taking blame that is rightfully his. \n \n \n\n Your \"logic\" is that of a child. So, let's elect a complete idiot to preserve the party, especially at such an important time in our history. No matter what damage he most likely will do?\n\n \n You obviously didn't understand, but unidimensinal cognition usually does that to people. You elect a politican who shows that your ideology is obvously better by causing harm to America with his. By having 4 years of a bad liberal president in power, the public will rush back to conservatism for possibly another 8, thereby increasing your chances to enact conservative legislation for a longer period of time. As for a important time in our history, why shouldn't we change? Bush has bumbled the alleged war for terrorism, and any company who has had such bad leadership would hire a new president. We therefore should do the same. Kerry can't be that bad. At worst he won't do much aganist terrorism but at least he won't help it. \n \n \n\n ROTFLMAO, NOW we aren't voting for him because of missayings? What planet are you on?\n\n \n Does the comment about his flip flopping on voting for the war recall any memories? Republicans use that ALL the time aganist Kerry as a reason he isn't a good president. The fact that you don't see this is alarming. But then again, you make me value my education. \n \n \n\n Then provide proof equally, you are simply making these general statements to appear to be fair and open-minded\n\n \n I already proved you were a flaming liar. As for Gore, if 2 movies were inspired, he is technically correct. He may be a idiot for saying it, but unlike Quayle his words would be grammatically correct as well as contemporarily correct. \n \n \n\n No one is denying he made the statements, but to ignore the fact that the mainstream press is definitely slanted to the Left is, in fact, delusional\n\n \n True, but you are evading the blame for self responsibility. Quyale made the dumb comment and should take responsiblity. It is NO ONE's FAULT but HIS for MAKING the comment. It's amazing how you think you are conservative but show a contempt for self responsiblity. \n \n \n\n What in God's name (OOOOPS said a bad word) are you talking about? I was obviously saying that you are taking an IF and trying to spin it to make Gore shine...hypocrite\n\n \n That didn't make any sense either. Please reformuate your words to hold some level of intelligence. Besides, most of Quayle's great stupid comments were not ifs. The pollution one doesn't have a if. \n \n \n\n Give me proof where Bush has tried to scare Blacks into believing the Democrats are evil.\n\n \n I never said that he did. However, Cheney's comment about voting Kerry is voting terrorism is a CLEAR cut case of using scare tactics. \n \n \nGive me proof that Bush is scaring the living hell out of older folks,\n\n \n See above. \n \n \nYet again, can't say Kerry is bad WITHOUT bringing up Bush\n\n \n Because both of the canidates ARE bad. You apparently can't understand that. I don't like either. \n \n \n\n SUDDENLY, Mr. Politico can't recall one of the most famous misqoutes in history, you spineless weasel.\n\n \n First of all, i'm going to report that as a clear personal attack. 2nd of all, i'm going to highlight that you can't even provide a single shred of evidence. \n \n Here is dan qayle's famous pollution quote \"It isn't pollution that is hurting the environment, it's the impurities in our air and water that are doing it. \"\n \n I have also linked several sites of Dan's quotes. You have failed to provide any form of evidence and constantly resort to ad-homeni attacks\n \n \nIF you were a good Conservative, you would at least vaguely recall that misqoute that the Democrats used to literally scare the **** out of older folks\n\n \n what does that have to do with conservatism? Highlighting dumb democrat comments has nothing to do with the ideology, which shows you know nothing about what you are talking about.\n \n \n\n OH, by the way, did you know that Kerry was endorsed by the Communist Party here in the U.S.? So, Conservatives should vote for someone that the Communist Party sees as a stepping stone to their ultimate goal, JUST to make a point? ROTFLMAO\n\n \n communsim or stalinslim? I doubt you even know what communism is as well. As for Kerry's intitatives are hardly in tune with marxist communism. Show me ONE intiative that is communist. Oh wait, you can't.\n \n You're just like Jim, can't back a single thing you say.",

TERRIBLE persident, great guy, but geez....what was America thinking in electing that XXXXX? \n \n \n All I can do is answer that with your own statement (pretty much applies to everything you say:\n \nYou have failed to prove that is wrong. All you can do is resort to ad-homein attacks instead of refuting the claim. \n \n \n \nProve that you know what conservatism is. You make claims, then you completely fail to refute anything, instead resorting to childish remarks. \n \n \n I need to prove nothing to you..interpret that any way you'd like\n \n \nYou can't say that. You're in no position to even TALK about conservatism. To you, the Republican party is conservative, even though it spends like liberals, actively attacks free market, and whole hardly embraces many socialist measures, as well as fleeing from accepting self responsibility. \n \n \n So, you are the self annointed savior of Conservatism? We're doomed LMAO\n \n \n \nHow can you? Kerry's a obvious douchebag, but Bush is just as bad. \n in response to this: WOW Mr. Politico, can you teach us more? LMAO SO, is that how you defend someone who will try to pull the wool over peoples eyes. I'm floored by THAT comeback, well thought out\n \n \n \nEveryone is a liberal to you if they do not have the rank and file notions of the Republican party. Heck, you think McCain is a liberal! Do you even know what liberalism IS? You have constantly FAILED to prove that you know anything about the terms you throw out. \n \n \n BLAH BLAH BLAH... here we go again\n \n \nIt is boring. He hasn't done much in terms of flare, but cosponsred/sponsored at least 67 different bills. None of which have serious flare. \n \n \n Shouldn't that tell you something? He either doesn't have the brains or the guts to stick his neck out and try to push through any meaningful legislation.\n \n \nWho said he's begging? I don't see him begging. IF anything, it's the dems begging HIM. As for libertain, McCain wouldn't fit. Liberterians are pro almost all forms of freedom, something McCain wouldn't fit into. Do you even know what libertain MEANS? Oh wait, you don't. \n\n \n Okay, then why are the Dems begging HIM? If he's SO Conservative, why would the Democrats want anything from him, there is so much hate between the two parties now you can cut it with a knife. That implies that there is something about him that they like. You should be able to admit that McCain Feingold was a disaster-Bush never should have signed it, unfortunately he was depending on the Supreme Court to toss it out...and yes, that is one of the things I am disappointed in Bush about. Fact still remains, McCain was rabid to have this passed, and it's a joke...not a very COnservative thing to do, robbing us of our freedom of speech like that\n \n \n \nKerry can't be that bad.\n\n \n LMAO, that's what people said about Carter..wake up\n \n \nDoes the comment about his flip flopping on voting for the war recall any memories? Republicans use that ALL the time aganist Kerry as a reason he isn't a good president. The fact that you don't see this is alarming. But then again, you make me value my education. \n\n \n Of course people are going to comment on his lack of decisiveness, or flip flopping if you will, but that isn't the ONLY reason. Frankly, his being a traitor is a huge one to me. I think he should've been executed back in 71 myself. My God, if I'm not mistaken they have a some kind of memorial to him in Vietnam! He turned his back on his feelow soldiers, couldn't care less about his record...that's unforgiveable\n \n \nI already proved you were a flaming liar. As for Gore, if 2 movies were inspired, he is technically correct. He may be a idiot for saying it, but unlike Quayle his words would be grammatically correct as well as contemporarily correct. \n \n \n AAAAAHHHH the psychotic mind, works in mysterious ways, huh? What 2 movies are you talking about? I originally referenced \"Love Story\" and you ran with it\n \n \nTrue, but you are evading the blame for self responsibility. Quyale made the dumb comment and should take responsiblity. It is NO ONE's FAULT but HIS for MAKING the comment. It's amazing how you think you are conservative but show a contempt for self responsiblity. \n \n \n Well, I'm glad you admitted it's delusional, that's the first step LOL And I really don't know how you've become so hung up on this self responsibilty stuff, I never said that Quayle didn't make the statements, but we all make stupid statements and it doesn't ruin our lives. The press is what did THAT\n \n \n \nThat didn't make any sense either. Please reformuate your words to hold some level of intelligence. Besides, most of Quayle's great stupid comments were not ifs. The pollution one doesn't have a if. \n\n \n Yes, but THIS statement by you DOES: \n If Gore WAS a inspiration for 2 movies, he would be correct. A few implies more then one. so therefore 2 would make him correct.\n\n \n \nI never said that he did. However, Cheney's comment about voting Kerry is voting terrorism is a CLEAR cut case of using scare tactics. \n \n \n Very clever, you learned well from Clinton, picking one or two little words very carefully to allow for wiggle room. You said this: \nJust as bad as Bush's scare tacitcs aganist Kerry. Scare tactics should be removed from politics as a whole because they are usually false and taken out of context. \n \n \n Sounds to me like you are accusing Bush of using scare tactics...now go and wiggle\n \n \nFirst of all, i'm going to report that as a clear personal attack. 2nd of all, i'm going to highlight that you can't even provide a single shred of evidence. \n \n \n First, I can take things like a man and don't have to run to Mommy to tell the big meany to stop. You have made numerous attacks on me and yet I have not whined once...HMMMMMMMMM a true Conservative would take his medicine like a man. Second, IF anyone gets warnings or gets banned for not providing proof, then you might as well shut down the site, because everyone does it to one degree or another. And third, why haven't you addressed this misqoute?. You could dodge a bullett no doubt LOL\n \n \nwhat does that have to do with conservatism? Highlighting dumb democrat comments has nothing to do with the ideology, which shows you know nothing about what you are talking about.\n\n \n OBVIOUSLY I was being sarcastic, but that evaded you somehow. The butchering of Gingrich's speech was not a dumb statement made by Deomcrats, it was a deliberate act designed to scare the poop out of older folks and it was a flat out lie, and there are whacked out Liberals today who will STILL take those words out of context to bash Conservatives. Being one like you SAY you are, you should be incensed by that.\n \n \ncommunsim or stalinslim? I doubt you even know what communism is as well. As for Kerry's intitatives are hardly in tune with marxist communism. Show me ONE intiative that is communist. Oh wait, you can't.\n\n \n C'mon, some people might be dazzled by your quick feet, but I'm not..it's boring. I stated a FACT and you twisted it, plain and simple. God, all you had to do was to say \"yeah I heard that\", or \"that doesn't mean anything\" and it would have been a better response than this. But oh no, you have to go off and defend Kerry yet again. Hope you feel good voting for a guy that the Communist party will be voting for",

   "Being \"anti environment\" makes him a \"flaming fiscal liber\n al\"?\n\n \n No. Enviromentalism has never been a strong part of liberalism, contrary to Republican belief. Even from the heydays of the french revolution and American revolutions, enviromentalism has nowhere to be found. During the progressive era, both conservative and liberal policies adapted enviromental protection. Besides your claim doesn't even make sense. The enviroment is not directly related to fiscal policy. There are many aspects of conservatism, from social to fiscal. Bush has shown a clear love for liberal fiscal policies. \n \n \nEarlier, you stated that conservatives do, or should, support \"strong global alliances\". Like bowing at the alter of the UN?\n\n \n No. The UN is only good for 2 things: Funding and the illusion of legitmacy. The strong ties are those of the cold war, with Turkey, Britain, Germany, and a host of other smaller nations. Bush has abandoned those with lust. \n \n \nLike taking baby steps towards a one world government?\n\n \n World goverment is neither conservative nor liberal. But a WG would solve alot of problems....too bad it will only come through sheer violence. \n \n \nYou are confusing about your definations of Liberals and Conservatives. Please don't ask me to prove it, all one has to do is read through your posts.\n\n \n Prove it. If you can. I'm calling your bluff. \n \n A liberal is essentially one who supports equal opprounity. That is the basic definition of early liberalism in which the rest of the ideology is built on. Modern day liberalism favors large government, long term deficit spending, strong federalism, just to name a few. \n Conservativism has changed much from it's days in the 1800s. It was orginially suppose to enforce the monarchy's rule upon the nation and suppress any and all liberal ideas and revolutions. Modern day conservatism supports small government (and more privacy), state's rights, no deficit spending, self responsibility, just to name a few.",

A law that does not have backing for all general purposes does not exist. The bill was designed to cut soft money away and cut out the problems it caused.

Your clear ignorance of that shows you know little about it, yet your pompous attitiude thinks you do. Quayle's comments are his responsibility, media or no media. You cannot blame someone for showing something you did and then crying that it is there fault. You commited it so therefore you should take the blame. Clinton's act with his intern is the same way. With no media, no one would have known, but it still would have been his fault. Media or no media, you do the act, you say the words, it's your fault. \n \n \n\n Yes, but THIS statement by you DOES:\n\n \n How is this relevenat? You attacked on the aspect of Ifs. Gore's comments leave vague room. Quayle's do not. How is this revelant? \n \n \n\n Very clever, you learned well from Clinton, picking one or two little words very carefully to allow for wiggle room. You said this:\n\n \n Now you're grasping at straws. Btw, I see you completely failed to actually get off your butt and do some research on Kerry's 67 bills. Know what fallacy that is? It's the fallacy of laziness,.\n \n \n\n Sounds to me like you are accusing Bush of using scare tactics...now go and wiggle\n\n \n At least Cheney. Cheney stated that voting Kerry was inviting another terrorist attack. How is that not using scare tactics? \n \n \n \n First, I can take things like a man and don't have to run to Mommy to tell the big meany to stop.\n\n \n Actually you take things like a bully, resorting to ad-hoemni attacks when your points are refuted and you have nothing left of substance to say. Please, continue using ad-homeni attacks, I'd love to report you enough times to get you banned. \n \n \nYou have made numerous attacks on me and yet I have not whined once...HMMMMMMMMM a true Conservative would take his medicine like a man.\n\n \n Nothing of that sort in which you have. I never called you anything close to \"spinless weasel\" like you did to me. Conservatism has nothing to do with this. You really know nothing about the ideology. I CHALLENGE YOU TO SHOW WHAT YOU KNOW OF CONSERVATISM \n \n [quote[Second, IF anyone gets warnings or gets banned for not providing proof, then you might as well shut down the site, because everyone does it to one degree or another.[/quote]\n \n I never said banning you on proof. However, you make claim after claim and provide nothing to back it up. \n \n \nAnd third, why haven't you addressed this misqoute?. You could dodge a bullett no doubt LOL\n\n \n What misquote? you haven't provided any quotes in which to examine I provided the famous pollution quote, you provided nothing yet attack me for not examining what you haven't provided. How exactly am I suppose to dissect a quote that hasn't been presented? Am I to dissect something that is not here? How does white space represent the specific Gore comment? \n \n \n\n OBVIOUSLY I was being sarcastic, but that evaded you somehow. The butchering of Gingrich's speech was not a dumb statement made by Deomcrats, it was a deliberate act designed to scare the poop out of older folks and it was a flat out lie, and there are whacked out Liberals today who will STILL take those words out of context to bash Conservatives.\n\n \n First of all, they are bashing Republicans, not conservatives. The party as a whole is not conserative. Do you have a link to Gringrich's speech and a overview of the Democractic action aganist his speech? When you talk about a specific event, especially quotes and speechs, you NEED to either POST the article or give a link to the article. \n \n \n\n C'mon, some people might be dazzled by your quick feet, but I'm not..it's boring.\n\n \n irevelant. You constantly toss out terms you have no knowledge of, and reply to challenges to show what you know which personnal attacks such as \"spinless weasel.\" \n \n \nI stated a FACT and you twisted it, plain and simple.\n\n \n If it was a fact, then you should have no problem repeating it. What fact and where? \n \n \nGod, all you had to do was to say \"yeah I heard that\", or \"that doesn't mean anything\" and it would have been a better response than this.\n\n \n heard what? You make vague references and provide no specifics. At least you could have the decency to link a article! \n \n [qupte]\n But oh no, you have to go off and defend Kerry yet again. Hope you feel good voting for a guy that the Communist party will be voting for[/QUOTE]\n \n I CHALLENGE YOU AGAIN, WHAT ASPECT OF KERRY'S PLAN ARE COMMUNIST?",

   "Nothing? He co/sponsored at least 67 different bills. hardly nothing.\n \n \n Okay, using your words, boring then, which translates to nothing of importance\n \n \nThere is a reason I don't like people like you, when push comes to shove, you got nothing. \n \n \n Another might be I'M a Conservative and YOU aren't. And when push comes to shove, ONE of us can take it and ONE of us runs like a baby to Mommy to whine and cry LOL\n \n \nWhat do you define as meaningful? \n \n \n AHHHHHHH, the definition of \"is\" strategy. THAT'S the problem that you Liberals have created, people with integrity have an understanding of what meaningful would mean, but you people have to define every stiinking word down to the very atoms that make it up. YOU'RE the one that scurries away like a scared mouse, quit hiding behind this tactic\n \n \nBecause they realize McCain has a lot of weight with conservative voters. \n\n \n Ummmm, he lost the Primary...that says alot about the weight he has with Conservative voters LOL\n \n \n That McCain can silence many of Bush's lackeys, including many of the 527s. \n\n \n It's BECAUSE of McCain Feingold that there ARE 527's to begin with\n \n \nWhile there may be hate between the parties, many of the congressmen still respect each other for who they are. \n \n \n I think we can add naive to the long list of adjectives for you. You really think these people respect each other? LMAO\n \n \n \nRepublicans have filed TWICE the amount of compliants as the Democrats have regarding 527s. \n \n \n What does THIS statement have to do with ANYTHING?\n \n \nAnd that's what people said about Bush...wake up. \n\n \n LOL, how do you figure? There was no imcumbent, and I don't think people voted for Bush because they hated Gore \n \n \nThat's your opinion. \n \n \n You betcha it is\n \n \nApparently whistleblowing is bad to you. Was the soldier who turned his back on the soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners, many of whom were common petty theives, was his act unforgivable? Apparently in your logic, it was. \n \n \n Trying to compare the two? The Vietnamese leadership has been quoted (and nope, don't have them) as saying that Kerry's testimony helped to hasten the end of the war, a war they said they were beginning to lose. He was LYING about the widespread \"abuses\", saying things that other Americans were being tortured to force them to say and they resisted\n \n \n \nYou're a liar. You used the Gore quote about the internet when it was a known lie.\n \n \n To show MY maturity, I read his qoute and yes, he did not say he INVENTED the internet, but he DID say he that he created it or something to that effect, when in reality the internet was created two years before he was elected to Congress. SO, I think his STRONG inference was designed to claim some sort of credit while giving him some room to wiggle\n \n \nAs for the two movies, I don't know if that is true or not, and neither do you. \n \n \n Well, I still don't know about these TWO you speak of, but the guy that wrote Love Story said Gore had nothing to do with it. \n \n \nHowever, if 2 movies were in fact inspired in any way, shape or form, Gore's self serving comment would be technically correct. \n \n \n I'm sorry, but I'm simply floored that you could use this hypothetical. You keep trying to justify what Gore claims by saying IF it were true...what a joke. I tell you what, IF Quayle had not made stupid comments, then he would have been the greates, most brilliant politician ever\n \n \n \nAt least Cheney. Cheney stated that voting Kerry was inviting another terrorist attack. How is that not using scare tactics? \n \n \n It KILLS you to admit anything...OH, I get it, your \"at least Cheney\" is basically the same as admitting it? NO GUTS ANyway, the terrorists would LOVE to have Cheney as President...wonder why? Is it REALLY to pull troops out, or is it because they can do under Kerry's watch what they did under Clinton's watch. SOOO, based on at least SOME degree of truth, Cheney is not using scare tactics\n \n \nPlease, continue using ad-homeni attacks, I'd love to report you enough times to get you banned. \n \n \n I see you already reported me, and I'm sure there will be more chances for you to do so in the future. REAL men are Conservatives!!!\n \n Sorry, won't waste my time with the rest, getting kinda bored playing your childish games",

   "No. Enviromentalism has never been a strong part of liberalism, contrary to Republican belief. Even from the heydays of the french revolution and American revolutions, enviromentalism has nowhere to be found. During the progressive era, both conservative and liberal policies adapted enviromental protection. Besides your claim doesn't even make sense. The enviroment is not directly related to fiscal policy. There are many aspects of conservatism, from social to fiscal. Bush has shown a clear love for liberal fiscal policies. \n\n \n If environmentalism isn't a strong part of liberalism, why is it such a big part of the liberal agenda? The environment is not directly related to fiscal policy? We have a 7 billon dollar EPA, and almost countless environmental groups, like the Sierra Club, the Earth Liberation Front, etc. Scaring the public about the environment is big business. The ELF's millions of dollars in vandalism is related to fiscal policy - someone has to pay for it.\n \n \n \n \n \n World goverment is neither conservative nor liberal. But a WG would solve alot of problems....too bad it will only come through sheer violence. \n\n \n Too bad?? Nice to see you admit that you endorse it.\n \n \n \n \nProve it. If you can. I'm calling your bluff. \n\n \n You're so brave.\n \n \nA liberal is essentially one who supports equal opprounity. That is the basic definition of early liberalism in which the rest of the ideology is built on. Modern day liberalism favors large government, long term deficit spending, strong federalism, just to name a few. \n Conservativism has changed much from it's days in the 1800s. It was orginially suppose to enforce the monarchy's rule upon the nation and suppress any and all liberal ideas and revolutions. Modern day conservatism supports small government (and more privacy), state's rights, no deficit spending, self responsibility, just to name a few.\n\n \n A liberal supports equal oppertunitiy - how warm and fuzzy - and you've angrily called Bush a Liberal in past posts. Modern day liberalism favors large DOMESTIC government, not a constitutional strong defence.\n \n You'll passonatly defend Kerry, then a few posts later, call him an idiot. You'll make it appear like you endorse small government, then indicate you'd like Nader to win. I realize that's not proof to you - you're on the receiving end, and your receiving proof is complex indeed. As I said, read through your posts. It's easy, go to members, page three of the D's, find Duo Maxwell, and in that profile, click on \"read all posts by\"..... It won't convince you, but it probably will just about anyone else who decides to check it out. What is it - 20 pages or more long!! That's a LOT!! Is it worth as much as 20 pages of EPA links??",

   "Because I didn't want to waste space on a quote that didn't make sense. Therefore I cut most of it out and showed that I did with periods, but gave you the information as to which quote you need to rephrase. \n\n \n It made sense to anyone who had a clue what was going on in the 80's.\n \n \n \n \nThere was talk radio in the late 80s. As for the internet, it was getting started with small funding and military applications. \n\n \n They both had absolutely NO EFFECT on public information at that time.\n \n \n \n \nHardly, If anything today's networks are less policed. The feds cracked down on far more issues during the late 80s and earlu 90s then they do now. The rate of censorship is decrease as time elapses, not increasing.\n\n \n I wasn't referring to government policing and censorship, I was referring to PRIVATE sources of information. \n \n \n \n \nUnlikely. CBS would have been slapped with a fine considering that the feds were less tolerant of their actions as they are today. \n\n \n See above. The feds or the PUBLIC wouldn't have known about the forged documents, since there was no internet, talk radio, or Fox news to make anyone aware of it. The only networks of the day - CBS, ABC, NBC -weren't then, and don't today, police each other.\n \n \n \n \nWho said I was afraid? You were the one who didn't make sense. \n \n \n \n It doesn't change the fact that Quyale said what he said and therefore should be accountable regardless of the media. You're moving the blame away from the source of the quote onto something that is only a means of communcating. Sounds like passing the buck and dogding the blame, hardly conservative at all. Clinton's act with his intern is therefore not his fault but the media's now? Hardly. It is his fault and Quayle's idiotic comments are his as well. Stop passing the buck and accept that people need to take responsibility for their actions and words. \n \n \n \n ....that in your opinion with absolutely nothing to back it up. \n\n \n Didn't make sense - nothing to back it up. This makes it pretty clear that you are clueless about the late 80's. Were you even alive then? \n \n \n \n \n \nClear? Yes. Revelant? No.\n\n \n The time period that Quayle was vice president, and his actions, isn't relevent to the way he was destroyed?? emoticon_confused",

   "\n I have stated I don't like either party, and that Republicans are not conservatives. Besides, both are bad, and I have stated in a perfect world, everyone would run independent.\n \n \n \n Typical Republicans, complete disregard of conservative notions.\n\n \n \n \n \nHAHA! Great contradiction in your post. First, Republicans are not Conservatives. Then, Republicans are disregarding their Conservative notions? You need to pick...which one is it? Republicans are or aren't Conservatives?\n \n Then you say that both are bad (Republicans and Conservatives), but you go ahead to say that Republicans are disregarding their Conservative notions. If Conservative notions are bad (which you say), why would it be bad for Republicans to disregard them?\n\n \n The only thing that sent your frontal lobe into a whirlwind is that you inserted the word \"their\" into his statement. He did not say that.\n \n He also didn't say that conservatives are bad, he said both parties are bad.\n \n The fact that I can say BOTH parties and everyone knows what I am talking about is bad.",
