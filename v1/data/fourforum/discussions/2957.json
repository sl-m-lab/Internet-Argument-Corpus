I do appreciate private property rights just as much as the owner. Problem is where I live its almost impossible to buy a home right now, and I make a decent living. A 2 to 3 bedroom home in a relatively decent area is about 450k...Which now forces us to think about many things, one of which is moving elsewhere to afford a home.\n Now I would say we are middle class and can't buy a house.. thats very scary. I would love to own a home, now how do we make that happen for so many people that are in the same boat?",

It ends with Bush saying, \"If you own something, you have a stake in America\". \n\n \n I tend to look at underlying messages within the political vomit known as ads or speeches. Considering that residential construction is currently our strongest industry and manufacturing has been replaced by mostly service industries, our GDP is now 80% consumer and government spending, well above the norm for a developed nation. The fed is holding off from any serious interest rate increases to stabilize residential construction until after the election. Voter focus regardless of party affiliation, according to all polls, is on the economy. I read it as spend to polish the GDP and make the economy look better. In Bush's shoes, what message would you really be attempting to convey? \n \n I can't comment on Kerry's intent as other than Bush's Christian Crusade mentality, I can't fathom any difference in their platforms.

Right now we're in a process of pushing former federal programs down to state levels to free up desperately needed cash flow to continue record expansion of the federal bureaucracy and military. Those programs carry all the federal trappings of 'one size fits all', including compliance, and guess where the tax base is at state and muni levels? Business and property owners. While state and muni level business taxation will continue taking the hit for our ludicrous foreign policy from those funding changes, many states are implementing property tax caps to slow vaporizing wealth. Take a look at state bond indebtedness per capita over the past three years. Kansas is a good example of many, from $200 to $1600 per capita in general revenue bonds, which means they, like the feds, are not borrowing for specific projects but to make ends meet. Debt irresponsibility starts at the federal level and now permeates our society. The more property owners the nation has, the broader the base to facilitate forcing federal programs to state/muni levels. For as long as the real estate bubble holds.",

We want to move to Hawaii but that also mean a 30% pay cut for our fields...and real estate is also on the rise there...QUOTE]\n \n 50,000 former residents from mostly Oahu, Hawaii have relocated here, Las Vegas, with many more into CA. While the Mainland US has always been a good market for Hawaii's primary industry of tourism, Japan has always been the big gun. When the Japanese economy went soft, so did Hawaii's share of their vacationers. That may again change as the dollar keeps falling against the yen and makes Hawaii a bargain for those spending yen or euros, but it won't help Hawaiian paychecks. An even larger issue facing our travel industry is US paranoia regarding retaliation to our foreign policies. Our efforts at internal security are making us mirror police state attitudes at a time when we're far from being the most popular kid on the block. Asians have many other Pacific paradise vacation locations to choose from and many are saying travel to and in the US just isn't worth it. Keep that future in mind when considering relocation to and purchasing property in Hawaii. \n \n You're in the same financial position as many young couples raising families, bigger paychecks in metropolitian areas accompanied by what seems like unrealistic housing costs. Relocation outside of rapid growth areas provides realistic housing costs, complete with a substantial drop in income.",
