   "I almost feel bad for chrub and co. It has been a REALLY rough week for them. Too many of thier lies have unraveled for them to keep covering up for each other. The latest:\n \n http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,1752753,00.html\n \n \nWhite House admits Iraq WMDs error \n \n Suzanne Goldenberg in Washington\n Thursday April 13, 2006\n The Guardian \n \n \n The White House has acknowledged for the first time that a key moment in post-war Iraq, the declaration by George Bush that \"we have found the weapons of mass destruction\", was based on intelligence known in Washington to be false.\n The president's assertion on May 29 2003 that Saddam Hussein's arsenal had been located was based on the capture of two trailers claimed to be mobile biological warfare labs. In Mr Bush's TV interview that day, and for months afterwards, US officials used them to justify the invasion.\n \n However, the Washington Post yesterday reported that the Pentagon had sent nine US and British weapons experts to Iraq to examine the trailers, who concluded they had nothing to do with biological weapons, and transmitted their finding to Washington on May 27 2003.\n \n In response to the paper, the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, yesterday admitted Mr Bush had used false information but said he had been unaware of the fact, and called the reporting \"irresponsible\". \"The president's comments were based on intelligence assessments by the CIA and briefing by the intelligence community,\" he said. \"It's not something that turns round on a dime.\" However, by September 2003 vice-president Dick Cheney was still saying the trailers could have been used to make anthrax.\n\n \n It is REALLY sad that they best defense they could come up with was \"Uh, these things don't turn around on a dime\". Even if that was the case, and for whatever reason his morning intellignece briefs did not include the fact that the ONLY piece of potential evidence that we had for Iraqs WMDs had just been proven to NOT be related (and worse, that the french were right before the war when they said \"hydrogen generators\").\n \n While I am ALMOST willing to buy that he didn't know the first time he said it, the bush administration flogged this for MONTHS after. There were XXXXXX on this very board pushing this point even AFTER the official report discrediting it came out.",

I told the Americans,\" Saddam is heard saying, adding he \"told the British as well.\"\n \n \"In the future, what would prevent a booby trapped car causing a nuclear explosion in Washington or a germ or a chemical one?\" Saddam said.\n \n But he insisted Iraq would never launch such an attack. \"This story is coming, but not from Iraq,\" he said.\n \n ABC News said U.S. officials confirmed the tapes were authentic.\n \n Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told Saddam on the tape that \"the biological (attack) is very easy to make. It's so simple that any biologist can make a bottle of germs and drop it into a water tower and kill 100,000.\"\n \n Hussein Kamel, a son-in-law of Saddam's, who was then in charge of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction efforts, explained how Iraq held back information from the U.N. inspectors.\n \n \"We did not reveal all that we have,\" he said. \"We did not reveal the volume of chemical weapons we had produced.\"\n \n Kamel said Iraq had not revealed \"the type of weapons, not the volume of the materials we imported.\"\n \n Hussein Kamel defected to Jordan shortly after the tapes were recorded, and Iraq was forced to admit it had concealed its biological weapons program. Kamel returned to Iraq in February 1996 and was killed by security forces.\n \n Charles Duelfer, who led the official U.S. search for weapons of mass destruction, told ABC News the tapes show extensive deception but don't prove (nor disprove - EZ) that weapons were still hidden in Iraq at the time of the U.S.-led war in 2003.\n \n \"What they do is support the conclusion in the report which we made in the last couple of years, that the regime had the intention of building and rebuilding weapons of mass destruction, when circumstances permitted,\" he said.\n \n http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/02/16/ap/world/mainD8FQ1M9O0.shtml\n \n \n \n \n \n \n http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/02/16/ap/world/mainD8FQ1M9O0.shtml",

For all the doting coverage of a sympathetic media, the fact remains that the only thing the demonstrators have accomplished is waving a few posters around. \n \n On May 8, many of us, if only in spirit, stood with President Bush at Margraten cemetery as he honored American soldiers killed while battling to liberate Europe. The occasion recalled another liberation by American soldiers-that of Iraqi citizens from one of the world's worst tyrants, Saddam Hussein. It is well to remember that, had Europe's left-wing demonstrators gotten their way, it would never have come to pass.\n \n http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=18151\n\n \n While it was a lovely little story, I didn't see a single Dutch politician's quote on WMD's in it.",

   "What do well illustrate though is the US prediliction of trying to perpetuate the id\u00e9a that without the western front the Nazis would have been in power to the present day and thus there's a debt of gratitude that stretches beyond 60 years. That the Soviets had beaten the Nazis back in 42 and had them on the retreat since then is somehow forgotten. The western allies invasion sped up the inevitable and saved half of Europe from ending up behind the descending iron curtain for sure. But expecting gratitude 60 years after is a pointless as if the french would constantly yammer on about the US ingratitude in remembering their help in founding their nation. Interesting how rare you hear about that fact isn't it? Especially with such ludicrous nonsense as the kindergarten level 'Freedom Fries' insults.",

   "the fact that people still will defend a liar because other politicians have lied before shows nothing more than stupidity. polticians lie. thats what they do. thats what they get paid to do. thats what they are sworn in to do. when you find a politician lying, you dont make excuses for them. you make them face the consequences of getting caught\n \n americans have blind faith and a bunch of people we refer to as authorities, mainly consisting of the government, the scientific community, and the media. these \"authorities\" have a god-like positin of being always right and always true. sadly, even the secular sect of the country behaves this way. its a form of religious slavery that the non-religious can patricipate in. how nice for the members of these groups. its a system thats almost too good to be true, which is why it is ;)",
