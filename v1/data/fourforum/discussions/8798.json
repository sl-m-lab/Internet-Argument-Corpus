   "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/31/AR2006083101460_pf.html \n \n \"It follows that one of the most sensational charges leveled against the Bush White House -- that it orchestrated the leak of Ms. Plame's identity to ruin her career and thus punish Mr. Wilson -- is untrue. The partisan clamor that followed the raising of that allegation by Mr. Wilson in the summer of 2003 led to the appointment of a special prosecutor, a costly and prolonged investigation, and the indictment of Vice President Cheney's chief of staff, I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, on charges of perjury. All of that might have been avoided had Mr. Armitage's identity been known three years ago.\"\n \n \"it now appears that the person most responsible for the end of Ms. Plame's CIA career is Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson chose to go public with an explosive charge, claiming -- falsely, as it turned out -- that he had debunked reports of Iraqi uranium-shopping in Niger and that his report had circulated to senior administration officials. He ought to have expected that both those officials and journalists such as Mr. Novak would ask why a retired ambassador would have been sent on such a mission and that the answer would point to his wife. He diverted responsibility from himself and his false charges by claiming that President Bush's closest aides had engaged in an illegal conspiracy. It's unfortunate that so many people took him seriously.\"\n Of course opponents of the administration have been largely silent on these recent findings, desite the fact they went nuts on trying to paint the administration as trying to get some kind of revenge on Wilson. Now that we know the administration was not, I wonder how many will have the integrity to admit they were wrong? And of course, the media hasn't played this up nearly as much as they did when the story was damaging to the administration. Now that it exonerates Bush, they could care less.",

It turns out the Rove and Libby did, indeed, dissiminate classified information in an attempt to discredit wilson. The only thing that has changed is that instead of Rove directly leaking it to the press, Rove gave it to the guy who DID leak it to the press.
