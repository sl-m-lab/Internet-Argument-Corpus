   "DISCLAIMER: Look, this is my opinion based on significant information I have gathered. It is not my purpose to have Christians stirred up over writings I present. You have your opinion, based on the scriptures of which I have much difficulty. Let's just leave it at that for now. \n \n There is no proof that Jesus existed. It would be difficult to credit the Bible generally (and the gospels in particular) as proof of anything. It is, at best, anecdotal evidence, viz. stories whose authorship cannot be authenticated and which cannot be corroborated except by other hearsay evidence. Although there are references in the Scriptures of persons, places and events whose existence can be corroborated by other historical records, it is hard to credit the story of Jesus in the gospels as anything more than fable. \n \n The four gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) cannot be authenticated; and even if they could, they cannot be proved to be contemporary accounts as witnesses to the events described or even recorded recollection. They were most likely popular stories handed down by verbal tradition and miscellaneous writings of the early Christian sects, which were later collected and revised under the support of the Church (not all of the gospels were approved), and eventually translated into Latin by St. Jerome in the 4th Century A.D. The English Bible, as stated supra, is even more &#8220;attenuated&#8221;, being translated by William Tyndale, who used the Hebrew and Greek texts and not the Latin Vulgate; which translation was later revised (and edited) as the King James Version. To argue over which version of the Scriptures is correct is merely to argue the question.\n \n For the same reason, it is debatable that these texts can even be relied upon as an historical record. For example, we know a great deal more about Pontius Pilate than we do about Jesus. Pilate was a Roman aristocrat, a knight of the equestrian class, and appointed Procurator of Judea as representative of the Emperor Tiberius. The historical references to Jesus, on the other hand, are sketchy at best. Philo of Alexandria, who was a contemporary of Jesus and Paul, does not mention Christ or the Christians; and the brief account of Flavius Josephus in the Testamonium Flavianum (C.E. 93) appears to have been added by a later hand. Even the reference by Tacitus is second-hand hearsay (probably from his friend and correspondent Pliny the Younger, who was Governor of Bithynia, and would have had access to the historical records and reports of the region). See Annals, 15.53. \n \n The proof (or disproof) of an alleged fact is determined by evidence of which there are many kinds, e.g., physical evidence, testimonial evidence, opinion evidence, demonstrative evidence, scientific evidence, etc.; and what is required to prove an asserted fact depends on the matter in question, and the probative value of the relevant evidence of it. In this respect, the Bible is no more relevant than other ancient literary works such as Homer as proof. Questions of this sort require one to assume as true what may not be prone to proof; which presumptions invariably result in irrational arguments that get nowhere. \n \n The truth is that the Scriptures are just not intended to be subject to such critical examination; and to argue the validity of the numerous texts, again, merely begs the question. You can argue it forever, but it will bring you no closer to the truth.",

   "The Writings of Flavius Josephus\n \n In Rome, in the year 93 AD, the Roman historian Flavius Josephus published his extensive history of the Jews. In discussing the period in which the Jews of Judaea were governed by the Roman procurator Pontius Pilate, writings attributed to Josephus include this revealing account that points not only to Jesus of Nazareth having lived, but that He was the Messiah, and rose from the dead:\n \" About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he was one who performed surprising deeds and was a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. He was the Messiah. And when, upon the accusation of the principal men among us, Pilate had condemned him to a cross, those who had first come to love him did not cease. He appeared to them spending a third day restored to life, for the prophets of God had foretold these things and a thousand other marvels about him. And the tribe of the Christians, so called after him, has still to this day not disappeared. \" - Jewish Antiquities, 18.3.3 \u00ef\u00bf1/263 (Based on the translation of Louis H. Feldman, The Loeb Classical Library.)\n Some scholars maintain that the references to Jesus as Messiah in this passage are later interpolations by Christians, but just for a moment let's focus just on the historical evidence for the existence of Jesus. On that basis, the account by Josephus of the death of James, brother of Jesus, widely accepted even amongst the most independently minded scholars, is further confirmation that Jesus existed as a historical figure:\n \" The younger Ananus, who had been appointed to the high priesthood, was rash in his temper and unusually daring. He followed the school of the Sadducees, who are indeed more heartless than any of the other Jews, as I have already explained, when they sit in judgment. Possessed of such a character, Ananus thought that he had a favorable opportunity because Festus was dead and Albinas was still on the way. And so he convened the judges of the Sanhedrin, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, the one called Christ, whose name was James, and certain others, and accusing them of having transgressed the law delivered them up to be stoned. \" (Jewish Antiquities 20:29 Louis Feldman translation)",

   "Vocabulary\n \n Some of the passage fails a standard test for authenticity, in that it contains vocabulary not otherwise used by Josephus.[14] On the other hand, \"the vocabulary and grammar of the passage (after the clearly Christian material is removed) cohere well with Josephus' style and language ... almost every word in the core of the \"Testimonium\" is found elsewhere in Josephus---in fact, most of the vocabulary turns out to be characteristic of Josephus.\" [15]\n \n [edit] Josephus's faith\n \n It is argued that \"He was [the] Christ\" can only be read as a profession of faith. If so, this could not be right, as Josephus was not a Christian; he characterized his patron Emperor Vespasian as the foretold Messiah.[citation needed]\n \n However, the supposed confession of Josephus relies on the standard text. But a recent study by Alice Whealey has argued that a variant Greek text of this sentence existed in the 4th century-\"He was believed to be the Christ.\"[16] The standard text, then, has simply become corrupt by the loss of the main verb and a subsequent scribal \"correction\" of the prolative infinitive.[citation needed] In any event, the audience for the work was Roman, and Roman sources always write of \"Christus\", never of \"Jesus\", which could make this merely an identification.[citation needed] It is also important to note that the word \"Christ\" simply means \"the anointed,\" so Josephus may have been simply including this as a detail.\n \n [edit] Anachronisms\n \n Some of the deepest concerns about the authenticity of the passage were succinctly expressed by John Dominic Crossan, in The Historical Jesus: The Life of a Mediterranean Peasant:[17] \"The problem here is that Josephus' account is too good to be true, too confessional to be impartial, too Christian to be Jewish.\" Three passages stood out: \"if it be lawful to call him a man ... He was [the] Christ ... for he appeared to them alive again the third day; as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him.\" To some these seem directly to address Christological debates of the early 4th century. Consequently, some scholars regard at least these parts of the Testimonium as later interpolations.\n\n Proof given to me was by citing Josephus. But there's plenty against him. Why is proof of the existence of Jesus, and as mankind's saviour, reliant on Josephus? Why isn't there volumes about him? We have so much documented evidence about so many others of that time, but not the Messiah? Why not? Bizarre, to say the least.\n \n And even if Jesus did exist, where is compelling evidence for his Messiahship, other than hotly-contested and unsubstantiated tales?",

   "It was at these lunch time spectacles that Romans executed Christians when local or national officials were in a persecuting mode. Public response to these executions could vary dramatically. On the one hand, Christians who refused to sacrifice to the Roman gods, flagrantly rejected the norms of the society in which they lived. There are plenty of examples of communities demanding that their leaders send Christians to the arena for public execution (cf. accounts of Jews demanding that Pilate order the execution of Jesus). On the other hand, the \"crime\" of Christianity was quite different than the crimes of others executed in the arena (murder, temple theft, etc.). Christian sources, at least, report that the dignity of Christians in facing a spectacle intended to degrade and humiliate them, often inspired respect among the crowds in the stadium.\n http://www.bates.edu/~mimber/Rciv/gladiator.htm\n Another difficult aspect of early christian history for the Roman historian is the evaluation of persecutions. We know that emperors on occasion instituted policies of suppression and persecution - Nero and Diocletion among the most famous (and the first and last to do so). We also know that the individuals who suffered in these persecutions, such as Perpetua and Agatha, suffered horribly. However, the evidence suggests that the routine policy of the Roman elite and imperial bureacracy was not persecution for the first two centuries of Christianity. In fact, to characterize the Roman response to Christianity far overstates the matter. By and large, members of the Roman elite ignored Christianity. If notice of Christianity was forced upon them, they tolerated it if they could. Because early Christian communities varied so greatly throughout the empire, moreover, it would have been impossible for Rome to craft a uniform policy on Christians. Pliny the Younger's effort to accomodate Christians, was, in fact, far more typical. [Admittedly, his efforts consisted of \"change your mind or I'll kill you - but he gave alleged Christians numerous opportunities to change their minds.] Because the Roman state religion lacked an orthodox theology and a cohesive organizational structure, it was the norm for Romans to tolerate an extraordinary range of religious beliefs and practices. From the Roman point of view, the ideal was to find a way to get Christians to be good Romans. It was an impossible goal because part of being a good Roman involved participation in the imperial emperor cult and in the general Roman community of sacrifice to the \"pagan\" gods. \n \n In fact, there is a considerable body of evidence that suggests that the leadership of the early Christian communities understood martyrdom as a means of rallying the community and gaining popular support outside the community. There is nothing particularly edifyng, however strongly you are committed to a pagan belief system, in watching someone be publicly tortured. Some accounts of Christian persecution and martyrdom suggests that Christians themselves forced the Roman state to take notice of their status as Christians. Because the imperial emperor cult was integral to Romanitas under the principate, it was inherently oppressive to those who identified as Christians. Even where Emperors and governors took a most liberal view on emperor cult, however, (forget the emperor, just join the community in a sacrifice), Christianity and traditional Roman religious beliefs could not be anything but opposed. Thus, from their point of view, the Roman state was always oppressing the Christians. In practice, a Roman governor could be very tolerant and quite lax in scrutinizing attendance at provincial ceremonies in honor of a deified emperor. This laissez-faire policy, however, might be irrelevant to a committed Christian. We have accounts of Christians who virtually assaulted Roman governors with their assertions of Christian identity. Governors, after a certain point ,had to respond to these Christians who were essentially confessing themselves to be traitors (people who would not sacrifice to the emperor). Moreover, Christian identity could become a contested local political issue in a variety of ways. One might, for example, charge that an enemy was a christian, not because he was particuarly concerned with religious matters, but because the charge would serve him politically in an election or lawsuit. The charge itself might ignite a larger local controversy than the originator could have anticipated or controlled.\n \n Reading accounts of the early Christian martyrs, moreover, might lead one to conclude that communities of Christians were in constant conflict with an oppressive Roman regime. In fact, by and large, most christian communities lived at peace with their pagan neighbors for decades on end. There are letters from some early Christians complaining of the very fact and accusing their brethern of \"selling out.\" It was not until the middle of the third century, C.E., that we find an effort from Rome to create a uniform policy on Christians. The Emperor Decius, for example, required all inhabitants of the Empire to offer a sacrifice to the gods (note, not himself) and to declare that they had always sacrificed to the gods. Local magistrates were ordered to give certificates to citizens who performed the sacrifice and passed the test. \n \n The development of a Roman \"anti-Christian\" policy [and the term \"policy\" here also overstates the fact - not all emperors between Decius and Diocletian attempted to suppress Christianity] can be attributed to a number of factors. First, it indicates the success Christians had in establishing themselves as a viable community with a distinct social and religious identity, and one with values completely in contradiction with traditional Roman religious thinking. Second, by the third century, C.E., the early Christians had begun to develop very strong internal systems of organization. Major cities had bishops and hierarchies of religious authority. Bishops from cities met in councils to determine heterdox belief and practice and condmened 'heretical' christians more vigorously than Romans condemned Christians in general. Romans percieved the strength of the Christian hierarchy and the rigor of its own internal control as a threat as real as the (far less structured) authority of Bacchic priests two centuries before. The persecutions of later emperors was aimed at the hierarchy of the early Christian church far more than it was at ordinary Christian congregant. In fact, the Emperor Decius was quoted as saying he feared the election of a new bishop of Rome more than he feared a rival claimant to his throne.\n \n http://abacus.bates.edu/~mimber/Rciv/christianity.htm",

   "Is this thread discussing whether a man called jesus existed, or whether that man was the son of God? Because those are two different issue. It could well be that jesus existed and people saw him as the messiah. I agree with jo in that the gospels cannot be waved away as anecdotal simply by comparing it to something like homer's work. The fact that the christian church sprang up immediately after the time that jesus died is probably the most compelling evidence for his existence and his ministry. \n \n However, the fact is that the story of jesus' life, particularly the major events, are copied right out of the lives of mythical messiahs prevalent in the surrounding cultures. There is no doubt that the historical periods where the israelites were under the rule of the egyptians, babylonians, syrians, persians, greeks and romans gave them much fodder to develop myths about their own God. We already know that the flood story was adapted out of persia and spiced up to create an image of God that is both vengeful and compassonate (but mostly vengeful), as well as explain how rainbows were invented. Yet christians all over the world still think that noah was a real man with a real ark and rescued animals from all over to world, etc. \n \n Back to the issue of jesus. I think the evidence suggests that jesus may have existed, been a sort of mystic rabbi, and with the help of gullible and overzealous disciples, made to be a larger-than-life son of God. They already had in their mind what their messiah would look like, and what events would mark his life, because they had many messiah models to draw on. And since their God, their myths and their religion were already copies of those belonging to other nations, then it would make sense that their messiah also follow suit.",

   "The Writings of Flavius Josephus\n \n In Rome, in the year 93 AD, the Roman historian Flavius Josephus published his extensive history of the Jews. In discussing the period in which the Jews of Judaea were governed by the Roman procurator Pontius Pilate, writings attributed to Josephus include this revealing account that points not only to Jesus of Nazareth having lived, but that He was the Messiah, and rose from the dead:\n \" About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he was one who performed surprising deeds and was a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. He was the Messiah. And when, upon the accusation of the principal men among us, Pilate had condemned him to a cross, those who had first come to love him did not cease. He appeared to them spending a third day restored to life, for the prophets of God had foretold these things and a thousand other marvels about him. And the tribe of the Christians, so called after him, has still to this day not disappeared. \" - Jewish Antiquities, 18.3.3 \u00ef\u00bf1/263 (Based on the translation of Louis H. Feldman, The Loeb Classical Library.)\n Some scholars maintain that the references to Jesus as Messiah in this passage are later interpolations by Christians, but just for a moment let's focus just on the historical evidence for the existence of Jesus. On that basis, the account by Josephus of the death of James, brother of Jesus, widely accepted even amongst the most independently minded scholars, is further confirmation that Jesus existed as a historical figure:\n \" The younger Ananus, who had been appointed to the high priesthood, was rash in his temper and unusually daring. He followed the school of the Sadducees, who are indeed more heartless than any of the other Jews, as I have already explained, when they sit in judgment. Possessed of such a character, Ananus thought that he had a favorable opportunity because Festus was dead and Albinas was still on the way. And so he convened the judges of the Sanhedrin, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, the one called Christ, whose name was James, and certain others, and accusing them of having transgressed the law delivered them up to be stoned. \" (Jewish Antiquities 20:29 Louis Feldman translation)\n\n \n \n It is will accepted by many scholars that the Testimonial Flavium was an interpolation, and there is good reason to show that Antiquities 20:9 was a copiers gloss. In any case, Josephus was writing 60 years after the alleged event, and hardly had first hand knowledge of the existence of Jesus.\n \n So many lies, so little time.",

Erastus was mentioned in Romans - you don't even know where to test for veracity the disinformation you project as truth here. You are dead wrong... buddy. And I never said he mentioned anything about Joseph and Mary. Just that we was there to attest to Christ having passed and been resurrected, we has a part of the Roman church being seeded by the Apostle Paul at the time... your info is way off. \n \n \n \n \nThe requirement for going to an ancestors home to be counted for a census is not historical. \n\n \n Your claim that it isn't is even more ground to believe was so, it was made an account historically by Scripture and secular scribes and their aids, so you skepticisms doesn't invalidate them, just reveals you as a cynic... which is fine just don't make claims or bogus dismissals out ignorance and bias.\n \n \n \n \nThe census mentioned in Luke happned in 6 c.e... while Matthew had Jesus being born during the reign of Herod the King, who died in 4 bce. Big gap there.\n\n \n \n Ah, no... Here... when did \"Caesar\" live? The question from any intelligent individual with the slightest modicum knowledge of the historicity of the region would ask \"which Caesar?\". The bible is an excellent source of historical timelines... but, if you know anything about the time period - it's moot. Herod was a title just like Caesar was... There were Herod[s]... [like Herod Antipas for one...]. Herod at this time presided over the territory of Judea, which is verified by Christ's trial. Pilot did not want to try him citing he could find no worng in his so he sent himback to Judea to Herod - and Herod thought this was beneath him... so he deferred back to Pilot. So that shoots your denial dead between the ears there. The bible was right on and the fact that you had three separate writers connoting the events from their perspective... advocates the veracity of Scripture from not only time point but from three different mindsets... and doesn't detract from its historicity and accuracy. Mathew was a secularist, publican and tax collector with a new life through Christ. Luke a physician and more analytical.... Mark was a zealot or liberal. So... have three mindsets that are no different than what you would have today but all said the same thing about the sime timetable. We call that \"witness\" which is what the word \"testament\" means.... those are the first \"witnesses\" from the Gospel [or good news as the word means]. Also... we dont' use that secular revisionist timeframe reference \"c.e.\" to reference the time of Our Lord, it is and shall always be B.C and A.D. - why, because it is the very time reference to the Church age... our time is measured by the power of His name.",

   "It stands to reason that if practical, common sense evidence exists that Jesus resurrected from the dead, then it goes without saying that even critics of His Lordship don't deny that he existed. You are attempting to rewrite history to fit with your personal desire to deny reality, as every historian of that period accepts without question.\n Jesus: The Evidence\n \n Although some evidentialists focus their apologetic on the scientific evidence for creation, by far the majority concentrate on defending the claims of Jesus Christ, and the overwhelming focus of these defenses pertains to belief in his resurrection from the dead.\n \n The two leading apologists writing on the Resurrection in the past twenty years or so have been Gary Habermas46 and William Lane Craig.47 Although Craig is a classical apologist, his position is in many ways compatible with evidentialism. And in fact, Habermas and Craig use very similar strategies in arguing for the reasonableness of believing that God raised Jesus from the dead.\n \n First, Habermas and Craig develop a set of &#8220;core&#8221; facts that are rarely denied by modern biblical scholars or historians writing on the subject and for which good evidence exists. Their enumerations differ from one presentation to another, but the following facts appear again and again on the lists.48\n \n 1. Jesus was publicly executed and died on a Roman cross.\n \n 2. Jesus was buried in a tomb.\n \n 3. Jesus&#8217; tomb was discovered empty the Sunday after his burial.\n \n 4. Jesus&#8217; followers had no basis for hoping that he would be raised from the dead.\n \n 5. Women friends of Jesus had experiences of seeing Jesus alive from the dead.\n \n 6. Jesus&#8217; apostles had experiences of seeing Jesus alive from the dead.\n \n 7. The first Christians proclaimed in Jerusalem just weeks after Jesus&#8217; death that he had literally risen from the dead.\n \n 8. Paul, a persecutor of the Christians, converted to faith in Christ after an experience of seeing Jesus alive from the dead.\n \n One may wonder why, if the vast majority of biblical scholars acknowledge these facts, so many of them question the Resurrection. Craig comments, &#8220;It may seem stupefying that while most New Testament critics who have written on these subjects accept the facts which, at least in my opinion, furnish inductive grounds for inferring the resurrection of Jesus, they do not themselves make that inference; but this is, in fact, the situation.&#8221;49 Craig himself bases his argument on facts admitted by this majority, &#8220;not because truth is determined by numbers, for it certainly is not; rather, it is precisely because . . .

In practice the two facts most often disputed are the empty tomb and the first appearances of Jesus. The credibility of the empty tomb is defended by several considerations.51 Paul&#8217;s reference to Jesus&#8217; death, burial, and resurrection as part of the received tradition of the church (1 Corinthians 15:3-5) and the burial account in Mark (which itself is likely pre-Markan) show that the empty tomb was a part of the earliest church&#8217;s understanding. The report of all four Gospels that women disciples of Jesus were the first to discover the empty tomb must be historical, since the chauvinistic men of that time were not likely to have invented such a detail. The fact that Jesus&#8217; tomb was not venerated as a shrine shows, again, that the earliest Christians believed the tomb to be empty. The report in Matthew 28:11-15 that the earliest Jewish explanation for the Resurrection story was that the disciples had stolen the body proves that Jesus had in fact been buried and the tomb was in fact empty. This is so, even if one is skeptical about Matthew&#8217;s claim that the tomb had been guarded to prevent the body from being stolen&#8212;since no one would make up such a story if the tomb had not become empty.\n \n The Resurrection appearances are shown to be authentic history for similar reasons.52 Again, the accounts of the appearances, especially in 1 Corinthians 15:6-8, are too early to have arisen as myths or legends. We have Paul&#8217;s firsthand testimony that he saw Jesus alive. The Gospel testimony that the first persons to see Jesus alive were women is self-evidently reliable. All these considerations are brought together by evidentialists to constitute a cumulative case showing that the Resurrection is the most probable, reasonable explanation of the facts.\n \n Third, alternative, naturalistic explanations are examined and shown to be less plausible or factually based than the Resurrection. These explanations typically function as alternatives to one or more of the generally accepted facts adduced by Craig and Habermas. For example, the swoon theory, which holds that Jesus merely passed out on the cross and was revived after being left for dead in the tomb, attempts to overturn the fact of Jesus&#8217; death. John Dominic Crossan&#8217;s theory that Jesus&#8217; dead body was left in a ditch or shallow grave and eaten by dogs is meant to circumvent the claim that Jesus was buried in a tomb. Evidentialists argue that such theories are either purely speculative or are based on misreadings of the New Testament writings, and that all fail to come to terms with significant factual evidence.\n \n Fourth, the positive argument from these facts to the conclusion of the resurrection of Jesus is presented. It is argued that the best explanation of the facts is that Jesus did actually rise from the dead. Habermas writes: &#8220;In particular, when the early and eyewitness experiences of the disciples, James, and Paul are considered, along with their corresponding transformations and their central message, the historical Resurrection becomes the best explanation for the facts, especially because the alternative theories have failed. Therefore, it may be concluded that the Resurrection is a probable historical event.&#8221;53\n \n Craig makes the same point in somewhat more developed fashion:\n \n . . . I am employing inductive reasoning understood according to the model of inference to the best explanation. This model holds that there may be a number of reasonable explanations for a body of evidence, and that one is to choose from this pool of live options that explanation which is the best, that is, which most successfully meets such criteria as having explanatory power, explanatory scope, and not being ad hoc. My claim is that the hypothesis &#8220;God raised Jesus from the dead&#8221; is the best explanation of the evidence discussed.54\n \n Lastly, Craig and Habermas argue that the resurrection of Jesus in the context of his life and teachings verifies his claim to deity. Jesus&#8217; claim to be God would lack all credibility had he remained dead. The fact that he rose from the dead provides strong warrant for accepting his divine claims. On the other hand, the Resurrection would lack all significance if it had appeared in history merely as an anomalous or inexplicable event. As Habermas and Licona observe, Jesus&#8217; life &#8220;created a context in which his resurrection from the dead would not be a surprise. He claimed that he was divine. He performed deeds that were interpreted as miracles. And he predicted his resurrection.&#8221;55 Instead, the Resurrection comes with an interpretive context of the supernatural acts and revelations of the God of Israel in the Old Testament and the supernatural works and claims of Jesus in his earthly ministry.56 Here these and other apologists adduce evidence from the Gospels that Jesus did in fact claim to be deity. Jesus forgave sins that had not been committed against him; he made statements that the Jewish authorities understandably interpreted as blasphemous claims to deity; he spoke on the Law of God as if it was his to define and apply.\n \n From the historical evidence for the Resurrection, then, evidentialists infer that God really did raise Jesus from the dead, and from this one point the whole of the Christian faith may potentially be defended. For if Jesus was raised from the dead, given the religious context of the event, then God evidently does exist. If God raised Jesus from the dead, then the true God is the God of Jesus Christ. He is the God of the Jewish people who inspired the Old Testament, who sent Jesus his Son into the world for our salvation, and who commissioned the apostles and their associates to establish the Christian church and to produce the New Testament.Bible.org: Presenting Evidence That Demands a Verdict\n \n So even liberal theologians and secular historians who deny certain facts regarding Jesus Lordship, aren't ignorant enough to deny His existence.

   "It stands to reason that if practical, common sense evidence exists that Jesus resurrected from the dead, then it goes without saying that even critics of His Lordship don't deny that he existed. You are attempting to rewrite history to fit with your personal desire to deny reality, as every historian of that period accepts without question.\n Jesus: The Evidence\n \n Although some evidentialists focus their apologetic on the scientific evidence for creation, by far the majority concentrate on defending the claims of Jesus Christ, and the overwhelming focus of these defenses pertains to belief in his resurrection from the dead.\n \n The two leading apologists writing on the Resurrection in the past twenty years or so have been Gary Habermas46 and William Lane Craig.47 Although Craig is a classical apologist, his position is in many ways compatible with evidentialism. And in fact, Habermas and Craig use very similar strategies in arguing for the reasonableness of believing that God raised Jesus from the dead.\n \n First, Habermas and Craig develop a set of \"core\" facts that are rarely denied by modern biblical scholars or historians writing on the subject and for which good evidence exists. Their enumerations differ from one presentation to another, but the following facts appear again and again on the lists.48\n \n 1. Jesus was publicly executed and died on a Roman cross.\n \n 2. Jesus was buried in a tomb.\n \n 3. Jesus' tomb was discovered empty the Sunday after his burial.\n \n 4. Jesus' followers had no basis for hoping that he would be raised from the dead.\n \n 5. Women friends of Jesus had experiences of seeing Jesus alive from the dead.\n \n 6. Jesus' apostles had experiences of seeing Jesus alive from the dead.\n \n 7. The first Christians proclaimed in Jerusalem just weeks after Jesus' death that he had literally risen from the dead.\n \n 8. Paul, a persecutor of the Christians, converted to faith in Christ after an experience of seeing Jesus alive from the dead.\n \n One may wonder why, if the vast majority of biblical scholars acknowledge these facts, so many of them question the Resurrection. Craig comments, \"It may seem stupefying that while most New Testament critics who have written on these subjects accept the facts which, at least in my opinion, furnish inductive grounds for inferring the resurrection of Jesus, they do not themselves make that inference; but this is, in fact, the situation.\"49 Craig himself bases his argument on facts admitted by this majority, \"not because truth is determined by numbers, for it certainly is not; rather, it is precisely because . . . I am interested in convincing outsiders that I appeal only to facts which would be accepted by the broad spectrum of scholarship, not just by conservatives.\"50\n \n Second, Habermas and Craig refute objections to each of these generally recognized facts and offer additional support for each of these planks of the argument.

   "The Inerrancy Of God's Word will never be bested by man's fallen nature or skepticism.\n\n \n Very true, what is so frustrating though is that I attempted to show these atheists in my post above that if historians and theologians accept the evidence for Jesus resurrection as possible, then to deny his existence is ludicrous. But they continue to mock it while claiming intellectual objectivity. \n The steps to proving the truth in the bible isn't taken lightly by scholars, yet we who have studied this evidence intensely are subjected to mockery by people who have never objectively looked at the evidence with an open mind. This excerpt from my link above deals with the evidence procuring process and it is extensive. But they will only come back with infantile scoffing if they are true to form. To actually have an intelligent discussion where both sides are seeking to actually prove if its true or not is impossible unfortunately. \n The first step for evidentialists such as Montgomery, then, is to defend the biblical writings, not as infallible Scripture, but as historically credible and reliable documents. Securing belief in God is not considered a prerequisite to taking this first step; only clearing away any methodological or philosophical assumptions that prejudge the question of the truth of the biblical narratives is necessary. So, for example, in his book History and Christianity, Montgomery details \"four common errors\" in the anti-Christian polemic of philosopher Avrum Stroll before beginning his apologetic proper: (1) Stroll relies almost exclusively on modern \"authorities\" of a radically rationalistic sort (17-18).2 (2) Stroll ignores the evidence of the earliest primary documents, specifically the letters of Paul (18-19). (3) Stroll begs the question by assuming that the miraculous events reported in the Gospels could not have happened simply because they were miraculous (19-21). Note that Montgomery does not argue here that miracles are possible; he simply objects to the assumption that they are impossible. (4) Stroll engages in groundless historical speculation when he suggests that the Christian view of Jesus was the product of \"messianic fever\" in first-century Judaism (21-22).\n \n Having cleared away these errors, Montgomery begins his positive case with this disclaimer: \"We won't naively assume the 'inspiration' or 'infallibility' of the New Testament records and then by circular reasoning attempt to prove what we have previously assumed. We will regard the documents, even though today they are usually printed on fine India paper with verse numbers, only as documents, and we will treat them as we would any other historical materials\" (25-26).\n \n To assure his readers he is employing an unbiased method of treating the historical reliability of the New Testament, Montgomery chooses tests of reliability drawn from a textbook on English literary history by a military historian.3 These are the bibliographical, internal, and external tests (26). Montgomery and other evidentialists use this threefold test regularly to defend the historical reliability of the New Testament.4\n \n The bibliographical test seeks to determine whether the existing or extant copies of a document are reliable reproductions of the wording of the original document. Montgomery emphasizes that we have many more manuscript copies for the New Testament writings than for other ancient writings, and that the time gap between the earliest complete copies and the originals is smaller for the New Testament than for other ancient writings (26-29). \"To be skeptical of the resultant text of the New Testament books is to allow all of classical antiquity to slip into obscurity, for no documents of the ancient period are as well attested bibliographically as the New Testament\" (29).\n \n The bibliographical test does not establish the factual accuracy of the historical narratives in the documents, only that the documents as we know them are substantially the same as they were when originally written. Accurate copies of fables would still be fables. But the claim is so often made that the New Testament writings are unreliable because of mistakes in the copying process that apologists find it necessary and helpful to point out the evidence for the textual reliability of the Bible.\n \n The second and third tests address the historical reliability of the contents of the biblical documents. The internal test considers the claims of the writings as to their historicity and internal consistency. Here Montgomery and other evidentialists insist \"that the benefit of the doubt is to be given to the document itself, not arrogated by the critic to himself\" (29). Paul's writings claim to be written by Paul, and the Gospels, especially Luke and John, claim to be recording history based on eyewitness testimony (29-30). These claims should be accepted at face value as truthful unless and until evidence to the contrary is produced.\n \n The external test asks whether the testimony of the biblical writings is corroborated or undermined by extrabiblical sources. Here Montgomery focuses on the Gospels. Luke's accuracy is confirmed by the archaeological and geographical investigations of William Ramsay toward the end of the nineteenth century (31-32). Second-century Christians who knew the apostles or their immediate disciples testified that the Gospels were based on eyewitness testimony. Thus Mark's Gospel was based on Peter's recollections; Matthew, himself an apostle, wrote his Gospel while the other apostles were still alive; Luke was written by Paul's traveling companion; and John the apostle wrote the Gospel bearing his name (32-34).\n \n Montgomery concludes \"that on the basis of the accepted canons of historical method . . . the New Testament documents must be regarded as reliable sources of information\" (43). This line of argument \"depends in no sense on theology. It rests solely upon historical method, the kind of method all of us have to use in analyzing historical data, whether Christians, rationalists, agnostics or Tibetan monks\" (44).\n \n Besides passing tests of general historical reliability, Scripture functions in more profound ways as the source of evidence for its own truth and the truth claims of Christianity. Evidentialists marshal evidences from a number of directions to build a cumulative case for the truth of the Bible. These evidences include the miracles of the Bible, the uniqueness of the Bible, and fulfilled prophecy. Later we will consider the evidentialist approach to the miracles of the Bible; here we will highlight the argument from fulfilled prophecy.\n \n Fulfilled prophecy, while it has always had a place in apologetics,5 has a distinctive use and emphasis in evidential apologetics, especially since the nineteenth century when books like Alexander Keith's Evidence of the Truth of the Christian Religion Derived from the Literal Fulfilment of Prophecy went through many editions.6\n \n Evidentialists note that \"fulfilled prophecy was part of the means of establishing Old Testament religion.\"7 John Bloom, for example, quotes the Lord's challenge in Isaiah issued to idols and all false gods to prove themselves by predicting the future (Isaiah 44:21-23; 44:7-8), and comments: \"The God of the Bible is calling for a rigorous test which involves the objective prediction of future events in human history. . . . Logically, we can reverse this challenge to other 'gods' and ask if the God of the Bible can predict the future Himself. If He can, and if no other religion can substantiate a similar claim, then we have an objective, historically testable verification that the God of the Bible alone exists.\"8\n \n Bloom identifies four criteria that need to be satisfied in order to conclude that a genuine prophecy has been given. (1) It must be clear. (2) We must know that it was given before the event. (3) It cannot be fulfilled by the actions of the human person making the prediction. And (4) its content must be unusually specific or long range so as to make its fulfillment remarkable. Bloom then implicitly adds a fifth, namely, that the successful prediction must not be accompanied by a number of false predictions. Thus Jeane Dixon might be given some credit for predicting John F. Kennedy's assassination but for the fact that so many of her other predictions have failed.9 Anyone making dozens of unlikely predictions year after year is bound to get a few of them right!\n \n Evidentialists point to three clusters of fulfilled prophecies as evidence for the divine inspiration and truth of the Bible. First, the Old Testament contains numerous prophecies concerning the rise and fall of various nations and cities surrounding Israel, such as Egypt, Tyre and Sidon, Babylon, and Nineveh. There is some dispute about the details of the Tyre prophecy in Ezekiel 26, but evidentialists are confident that the chapter, properly interpreted, was dramatically and literally fulfilled.10\n \n Second, evidentialists cite the existence and history of Israel as an amazing fulfillment of biblical prophecy.11 Robert Newman tells the story of the skeptical Frederick the Great, who asked his court chaplain for a good argument for God, to which the chaplain replied, \"The Jew, your majesty!\"12 The Bible predicts that the Jews would fall into idolatry and be chastised, yet would later be returned to the land. Evidentialists point out that nations have repeatedly tried to annihilate the Jewish culture and people and yet have failed; they see this as evidence of God's remarkable providential care for the Jewish people.13\n \n Third, evidentialists are especially impressed by the fulfilled prophecies in the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus. The Gospels, especially Matthew, strongly emphasize the idea that Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. Evidentialists are aware of the common criticism that the Gospel writers take the Old Testament texts out of context, but they reply that this criticism is without merit. Newman points out various paradoxical features of Old Testament messianic prophecies that find their natural and obvious fulfillment in Jesus. The Messiah was to be a Jew who brought light to the Gentiles (Isaiah 42:6-7; 49:5-6). He was to be born a human son, yet he preexisted as God (Micah 5:2; Isaiah 9:6-7). He will be humble yet exalted (Daniel 7:13-14; Zechariah 9:9). He will suffer ignominiously yet be vindicated and exalted as universal ruler (Psalm 22; Isaiah 52:13-53:12). He will be both king and priest, offices kept separate in Judaism (Psalm 110).14 Newman also cites prophecies indicating that the Messiah would come toward the end of the Second Temple period (ca. 515 b.c.-a.d. 70), making it impossible that any individual living after that time could be the Messiah (Haggai 2:3-9; Daniel 9:24-27).15\n \n These three types of fulfilled prophecies in the Bible add up to an impressive array of evidences that evidentialists believe are unparalleled and should be quite convincing. The skeptic whose worldview excludes divine fulfillment of prophecy is advised that the evidence is sufficient to call such a worldview into question. So Newman concludes, \"one would be a fool to keep appealing to accident when the evidence suggests one's worldview is faulty.\"16 Fulfilled prophecy, then, not only provides evidence for the inspiration of the Bible, but for evidentialists it also contributes to the case for the theistic worldview.\n \n Evidentialists are not alone in using fulfilled prophecy as part of their apologetic. However, while evidentialists use it to prove the existence of God, classical apologists generally do not. Norman Geisler, for example, states plainly: \"Fulfilled prophecy does not prove the existence of God, but it does show that unusual events predicted in his Name that come to pass are evidence of his special activity.\"17",

It's there... as well as others.\n\n \n What do you call this, chopped liver?\n \n \nVery true, what is so frustrating though is that I attempted to show these atheists in my post above that if historians and theologians accept the evidence for Jesus resurrection as possible, then to deny his existence is ludicrous. But they continue to mock it while claiming intellectual objectivity. \n The steps to proving the truth in the bible isn't taken lightly by scholars, yet we who have studied this evidence intensely are subjected to mockery by people who have never objectively looked at the evidence with an open mind. This excerpt from my link above deals with the evidence procuring process and it is extensive. But they will only come back with infantile scoffing if they are true to form. To actually have an intelligent discussion where both sides are seeking to actually prove if its true or not is impossible unfortunately. \n The first step for evidentialists such as Montgomery, then, is to defend the biblical writings, not as infallible Scripture, but as historically credible and reliable documents. Securing belief in God is not considered a prerequisite to taking this first step; only clearing away any methodological or philosophical assumptions that prejudge the question of the truth of the biblical narratives is necessary. So, for example, in his book History and Christianity, Montgomery details \"four common errors\" in the anti-Christian polemic of philosopher Avrum Stroll before beginning his apologetic proper: (1) Stroll relies almost exclusively on modern \"authorities\" of a radically rationalistic sort (17-18).2 (2) Stroll ignores the evidence of the earliest primary documents, specifically the letters of Paul (18-19). (3) Stroll begs the question by assuming that the miraculous events reported in the Gospels could not have happened simply because they were miraculous (19-21). Note that Montgomery does not argue here that miracles are possible; he simply objects to the assumption that they are impossible. (4) Stroll engages in groundless historical speculation when he suggests that the Christian view of Jesus was the product of \"messianic fever\" in first-century Judaism (21-22).\n \n Having cleared away these errors, Montgomery begins his positive case with this disclaimer: \"We won't naively assume the 'inspiration' or 'infallibility' of the New Testament records and then by circular reasoning attempt to prove what we have previously assumed. We will regard the documents, even though today they are usually printed on fine India paper with verse numbers, only as documents, and we will treat them as we would any other historical materials\" (25-26).\n \n To assure his readers he is employing an unbiased method of treating the historical reliability of the New Testament, Montgomery chooses tests of reliability drawn from a textbook on English literary history by a military historian.3 These are the bibliographical, internal, and external tests (26). Montgomery and other evidentialists use this threefold test regularly to defend the historical reliability of the New Testament.4\n \n The bibliographical test seeks to determine whether the existing or extant copies of a document are reliable reproductions of the wording of the original document. Montgomery emphasizes that we have many more manuscript copies for the New Testament writings than for other ancient writings, and that the time gap between the earliest complete copies and the originals is smaller for the New Testament than for other ancient writings (26-29). \"To be skeptical of the resultant text of the New Testament books is to allow all of classical antiquity to slip into obscurity, for no documents of the ancient period are as well attested bibliographically as the New Testament\" (29).\n \n The bibliographical test does not establish the factual accuracy of the historical narratives in the documents, only that the documents as we know them are substantially the same as they were when originally written. Accurate copies of fables would still be fables. But the claim is so often made that the New Testament writings are unreliable because of mistakes in the copying process that apologists find it necessary and helpful to point out the evidence for the textual reliability of the Bible.\n \n The second and third tests address the historical reliability of the contents of the biblical documents. The internal test considers the claims of the writings as to their historicity and internal consistency. Here Montgomery and other evidentialists insist \"that the benefit of the doubt is to be given to the document itself, not arrogated by the critic to himself\" (29). Paul's writings claim to be written by Paul, and the Gospels, especially Luke and John, claim to be recording history based on eyewitness testimony (29-30). These claims should be accepted at face value as truthful unless and until evidence to the contrary is produced.\n \n The external test asks whether the testimony of the biblical writings is corroborated or undermined by extrabiblical sources. Here Montgomery focuses on the Gospels. Luke's accuracy is confirmed by the archaeological and geographical investigations of William Ramsay toward the end of the nineteenth century (31-32). Second-century Christians who knew the apostles or their immediate disciples testified that the Gospels were based on eyewitness testimony. Thus Mark's Gospel was based on Peter's recollections; Matthew, himself an apostle, wrote his Gospel while the other apostles were still alive; Luke was written by Paul's traveling companion; and John the apostle wrote the Gospel bearing his name (32-34).\n \n Montgomery concludes \"that on the basis of the accepted canons of historical method . . . the New Testament documents must be regarded as reliable sources of information\" (43). This line of argument \"depends in no sense on theology. It rests solely upon historical method, the kind of method all of us have to use in analyzing historical data, whether Christians, rationalists, agnostics or Tibetan monks\" (44).\n \n Besides passing tests of general historical reliability, Scripture functions in more profound ways as the source of evidence for its own truth and the truth claims of Christianity. Evidentialists marshal evidences from a number of directions to build a cumulative case for the truth of the Bible. These evidences include the miracles of the Bible, the uniqueness of the Bible, and fulfilled prophecy. Later we will consider the evidentialist approach to the miracles of the Bible; here we will highlight the argument from fulfilled prophecy.\n \n Fulfilled prophecy, while it has always had a place in apologetics,5 has a distinctive use and emphasis in evidential apologetics, especially since the nineteenth century when books like Alexander Keith's Evidence of the Truth of the Christian Religion Derived from the Literal Fulfilment of Prophecy went through many editions.6\n \n Evidentialists note that \"fulfilled prophecy was part of the means of establishing Old Testament religion.\"7 John Bloom, for example, quotes the Lord's challenge in Isaiah issued to idols and all false gods to prove themselves by predicting the future (Isaiah 44:21-23; 44:7-8), and comments: \"The God of the Bible is calling for a rigorous test which involves the objective prediction of future events in human history. . . . Logically, we can reverse this challenge to other 'gods' and ask if the God of the Bible can predict the future Himself. If He can, and if no other religion can substantiate a similar claim, then we have an objective, historically testable verification that the God of the Bible alone exists.\"8\n \n Bloom identifies four criteria that need to be satisfied in order to conclude that a genuine prophecy has been given. (1) It must be clear. (2) We must know that it was given before the event. (3) It cannot be fulfilled by the actions of the human person making the prediction. And (4) its content must be unusually specific or long range so as to make its fulfillment remarkable. Bloom then implicitly adds a fifth, namely, that the successful prediction must not be accompanied by a number of false predictions. Thus Jeane Dixon might be given some credit for predicting John F. Kennedy's assassination but for the fact that so many of her other predictions have failed.9 Anyone making dozens of unlikely predictions year after year is bound to get a few of them right!\n \n Evidentialists point to three clusters of fulfilled prophecies as evidence for the divine inspiration and truth of the Bible. First, the Old Testament contains numerous prophecies concerning the rise and fall of various nations and cities surrounding Israel, such as Egypt, Tyre and Sidon, Babylon, and Nineveh. There is some dispute about the details of the Tyre prophecy in Ezekiel 26, but evidentialists are confident that the chapter, properly interpreted, was dramatically and literally fulfilled.10\n \n Second, evidentialists cite the existence and history of Israel as an amazing fulfillment of biblical prophecy.11 Robert Newman tells the story of the skeptical Frederick the Great, who asked his court chaplain for a good argument for God, to which the chaplain replied, \"The Jew, your majesty!\"12 The Bible predicts that the Jews would fall into idolatry and be chastised, yet would later be returned to the land. Evidentialists point out that nations have repeatedly tried to annihilate the Jewish culture and people and yet have failed; they see this as evidence of God's remarkable providential care for the Jewish people.13\n \n Third, evidentialists are especially impressed by the fulfilled prophecies in the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus. The Gospels, especially Matthew, strongly emphasize the idea that Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. Evidentialists are aware of the common criticism that the Gospel writers take the Old Testament texts out of context, but they reply that this criticism is without merit. Newman points out various paradoxical features of Old Testament messianic prophecies that find their natural and obvious fulfillment in Jesus. The Messiah was to be a Jew who brought light to the Gentiles (Isaiah 42:6-7; 49:5-6). He was to be born a human son, yet he preexisted as God (Micah 5:2; Isaiah 9:6-7). He will be humble yet exalted (Daniel 7:13-14; Zechariah 9:9). He will suffer ignominiously yet be vindicated and exalted as universal ruler (Psalm 22; Isaiah 52:13-53:12). He will be both king and priest, offices kept separate in Judaism (Psalm 110).14 Newman also cites prophecies indicating that the Messiah would come toward the end of the Second Temple period (ca. 515 b.c.-a.d. 70), making it impossible that any individual living after that time could be the Messiah (Haggai 2:3-9; Daniel 9:24-27).15\n \n These three types of fulfilled prophecies in the Bible add up to an impressive array of evidences that evidentialists believe are unparalleled and should be quite convincing. The skeptic whose worldview excludes divine fulfillment of prophecy is advised that the evidence is sufficient to call such a worldview into question. So Newman concludes, \"one would be a fool to keep appealing to accident when the evidence suggests one's worldview is faulty.\"16 Fulfilled prophecy, then, not only provides evidence for the inspiration of the Bible, but for evidentialists it also contributes to the case for the theistic worldview.\n \n Evidentialists are not alone in using fulfilled prophecy as part of their apologetic. However, while evidentialists use it to prove the existence of God, classical apologists generally do not. Norman Geisler, for example, states plainly: \"Fulfilled prophecy does not prove the existence of God, but it does show that unusual events predicted in his Name that come to pass are evidence of his special activity.\"17\n\n \n \nIt stands to reason that if practical, common sense evidence exists that Jesus resurrected from the dead, then it goes without saying that even critics of His Lordship don't deny that he existed. You are attempting to rewrite history to fit with your personal desire to deny reality, as every historian of that period accepts without question.\n Jesus: The Evidence\n \n Although some evidentialists focus their apologetic on the scientific evidence for creation, by far the majority concentrate on defending the claims of Jesus Christ, and the overwhelming focus of these defenses pertains to belief in his resurrection from the dead.\n \n The two leading apologists writing on the Resurrection in the past twenty years or so have been Gary Habermas46 and William Lane Craig.47 Although Craig is a classical apologist, his position is in many ways compatible with evidentialism. And in fact, Habermas and Craig use very similar strategies in arguing for the reasonableness of believing that God raised Jesus from the dead.\n \n First, Habermas and Craig develop a set of \"core\" facts that are rarely denied by modern biblical scholars or historians writing on the subject and for which good evidence exists. Their enumerations differ from one presentation to another, but the following facts appear again and again on the lists.48\n \n 1. Jesus was publicly executed and died on a Roman cross.\n \n 2. Jesus was buried in a tomb.\n \n 3. Jesus' tomb was discovered empty the Sunday after his burial.\n \n 4. Jesus' followers had no basis for hoping that he would be raised from the dead.\n \n 5. Women friends of Jesus had experiences of seeing Jesus alive from the dead.\n \n 6. Jesus' apostles had experiences of seeing Jesus alive from the dead.\n \n 7. The first Christians proclaimed in Jerusalem just weeks after Jesus' death that he had literally risen from the dead.\n \n 8. Paul, a persecutor of the Christians, converted to faith in Christ after an experience of seeing Jesus alive from the dead.\n \n One may wonder why, if the vast majority of biblical scholars acknowledge these facts, so many of them question the Resurrection. Craig comments, \"It may seem stupefying that while most New Testament critics who have written on these subjects accept the facts which, at least in my opinion, furnish inductive grounds for inferring the resurrection of Jesus, they do not themselves make that inference; but this is, in fact, the situation.\"49 Craig himself bases his argument on facts admitted by this majority, \"not because truth is determined by numbers, for it certainly is not; rather, it is precisely because . . . I am interested in convincing outsiders that I appeal only to facts which would be accepted by the broad spectrum of scholarship, not just by conservatives.\"50\n \n Second, Habermas and Craig refute objections to each of these generally recognized facts and offer additional support for each of these planks of the argument. In practice the two facts most often disputed are the empty tomb and the first appearances of Jesus. The credibility of the empty tomb is defended by several considerations.51 Paul's reference to Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection as part of the received tradition of the church (1 Corinthians 15:3-5) and the burial account in Mark (which itself is likely pre-Markan) show that the empty tomb was a part of the earliest church's understanding. The report of all four Gospels that women disciples of Jesus were the first to discover the empty tomb must be historical, since the chauvinistic men of that time were not likely to have invented such a detail. The fact that Jesus' tomb was not venerated as a shrine shows, again, that the earliest Christians believed the tomb to be empty. The report in Matthew 28:11-15 that the earliest Jewish explanation for the Resurrection story was that the disciples had stolen the body proves that Jesus had in fact been buried and the tomb was in fact empty. This is so, even if one is skeptical about Matthew's claim that the tomb had been guarded to prevent the body from being stolen-since no one would make up such a story if the tomb had not become empty.\n \n The Resurrection appearances are shown to be authentic history for similar reasons.52 Again, the accounts of the appearances, especially in 1 Corinthians 15:6-8, are too early to have arisen as myths or legends. We have Paul's firsthand testimony that he saw Jesus alive. The Gospel testimony that the first persons to see Jesus alive were women is self-evidently reliable. All these considerations are brought together by evidentialists to constitute a cumulative case showing that the Resurrection is the most probable, reasonable explanation of the facts.\n \n Third, alternative, naturalistic explanations are examined and shown to be less plausible or factually based than the Resurrection. These explanations typically function as alternatives to one or more of the generally accepted facts adduced by Craig and Habermas. For example, the swoon theory, which holds that Jesus merely passed out on the cross and was revived after being left for dead in the tomb, attempts to overturn the fact of Jesus' death. John Dominic Crossan's theory that Jesus' dead body was left in a ditch or shallow grave and eaten by dogs is meant to circumvent the claim that Jesus was buried in a tomb. Evidentialists argue that such theories are either purely speculative or are based on misreadings of the New Testament writings, and that all fail to come to terms with significant factual evidence.\n \n Fourth, the positive argument from these facts to the conclusion of the resurrection of Jesus is presented. It is argued that the best explanation of the facts is that Jesus did actually rise from the dead. Habermas writes: \"In particular, when the early and eyewitness experiences of the disciples, James, and Paul are considered, along with their corresponding transformations and their central message, the historical Resurrection becomes the best explanation for the facts, especially because the alternative theories have failed. Therefore, it may be concluded that the Resurrection is a probable historical event.\"53\n \n Craig makes the same point in somewhat more developed fashion:\n \n . . . I am employing inductive reasoning understood according to the model of inference to the best explanation. This model holds that there may be a number of reasonable explanations for a body of evidence, and that one is to choose from this pool of live options that explanation which is the best, that is, which most successfully meets such criteria as having explanatory power, explanatory scope, and not being ad hoc. My claim is that the hypothesis \"God raised Jesus from the dead\" is the best explanation of the evidence discussed.54\n \n Lastly, Craig and Habermas argue that the resurrection of Jesus in the context of his life and teachings verifies his claim to deity. Jesus' claim to be God would lack all credibility had he remained dead. The fact that he rose from the dead provides strong warrant for accepting his divine claims. On the other hand, the Resurrection would lack all significance if it had appeared in history merely as an anomalous or inexplicable event. As Habermas and Licona observe, Jesus' life \"created a context in which his resurrection from the dead would not be a surprise. He claimed that he was divine. He performed deeds that were interpreted as miracles. And he predicted his resurrection.\"55 Instead, the Resurrection comes with an interpretive context of the supernatural acts and revelations of the God of Israel in the Old Testament and the supernatural works and claims of Jesus in his earthly ministry.56 Here these and other apologists adduce evidence from the Gospels that Jesus did in fact claim to be deity. Jesus forgave sins that had not been committed against him; he made statements that the Jewish authorities understandably interpreted as blasphemous claims to deity; he spoke on the Law of God as if it was his to define and apply.\n \n From the historical evidence for the Resurrection, then, evidentialists infer that God really did raise Jesus from the dead, and from this one point the whole of the Christian faith may potentially be defended. For if Jesus was raised from the dead, given the religious context of the event, then God evidently does exist. If God raised Jesus from the dead, then the true God is the God of Jesus Christ. He is the God of the Jewish people who inspired the Old Testament, who sent Jesus his Son into the world for our salvation, and who commissioned the apostles and their associates to establish the Christian church and to produce the New Testament.Bible.org: Presenting Evidence That Demands a Verdict\n \n So even liberal theologians and secular historians who deny certain facts regarding Jesus Lordship, aren't ignorant enough to deny His existence. That foolishness is relegated to the ranks of the truly uninformed.\n",

Paul's writings claim to be written by Paul, and the Gospels, especially Luke and John, claim to be recording history based on eyewitness testimony (29-30). These claims should be accepted at face value as truthful unless and until evidence to the contrary is produced.\n",

   "There is an awful lot of confusion in here, so let's take it one step at a time:\n \n \nOn two things. One is a comparison of the phrase 'Brother of the one called Christ' from two texts in the bible, and also on the fact that 'Christ' in Latin\n would mean 'wetter', and would not make any sense to the target audience of Josephus without further explaination about what 'Messiah' meant.\n\n \n First of all, what does Latin have to do with this? Josephus is writing in Greek. Second, \"Christ\" is not a Latin word (it's \"Christus\"), and does not mean \"wetter\" (it means \"wetted\" or \"annoited\" or, of course, \"messiah\"). The same is true with the Greek &#967;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;. Thirdly, exactly how would it \"not make sense\" and require \"further explanation\"? Josephus is merely using it to identify which &#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#962; he is talking about, not writing a treatise on Jewish messianism. He didn't feel the need to explain the sense of &#917;&#960;&#953;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#951;&#963; when talking about Antiochus, did he? \n \n \nIf you look at the phrase 'brother of the one called Christ' it is word for word from how Jesus is referred to (practiclaly letter by letter)\n \n If you look at the phrase in Josephus, it is 'adelphos I&#275;sou tou legomenou Christou' This exact same phrase is used several times in the gospels\n ( Matthew [1:16, 27:17] and John [4:25])\n\n \n Here is the Greek of Josephus:\n \n ...&#922;&#945;&#952;&#953;&#950;&#949;&#953; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#948;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#953; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#957; &#949;&#953;&#962; &#945;&#965;&#964;&#959; &#964;&#959;&#957; &#945;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#957; &#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#965; &#964;&#959;&#965; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#965; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#965;, &#921;&#945;&#954;&#969;&#946;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945; &#945;&#965;&#964;&#969;, &#954;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#945;&#962; &#949;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#962;...\n \n So first of all, your transliteration is off (&#945;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#962; is in the accusative, not the nominitive). Now look at Matt 1.16 (from the NA27):\n \n ...&#954;&#969;&#946; &#948;&#949; &#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#957; &#953;&#969;&#963;&#951;&#966; &#964;&#959;&#957; &#945;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#945; &#956;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#962; &#949;&#958; &#951;&#962; &#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#952;&#951; &#953;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#959; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#967;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;...\n \n This is clearly not \"letter by letter,\" and the word \"brother\" does not appear at all. The four bolded words are not in the genitive like Josephus, but in the nominitive. Now 27.17:\n \n ...&#963;&#965;&#957;&#951;&#947;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#959;&#965;&#957; &#945;&#965;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#949;&#953;&#960;&#949;&#957; &#945;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#959; &#960;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#945; &#952;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#964;&#949; &#945;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#963;&#969; &#965;&#956;&#953;&#957; [&#964;&#959;&#957;] [&#953;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#957;] &#946;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#946;&#946;&#945;&#957; &#951; &#953;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#957; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#967;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;...\n \n Accusitive, and no brother. John 4.25:\n \n ...&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#953; &#945;&#965;&#964;&#969; &#951; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#951; &#959;&#953;&#948;&#945; &#959;&#964;&#953; &#956;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#953;&#945;&#962; &#949;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#959; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#967;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#964;&#945;&#957; &#949;&#955;&#952;&#951; &#949;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#945;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#953; &#951;&#956;&#953;&#957; &#945;&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;...\n \n No Jesus, no brother, and in the nominitive again. In any case, I don't understand why you think the occurance of four words in both Josephus and the similarly Greek language gospels indicates interpolation.\n \n But is it four words you think are interpolated? I'm not quite sure what exactly you're proposing anymore. In the post I originally quoted, you said 20.9.1 was talking about a different Jesus, in which case &#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#965; was originally part of the text. But here you seem to be suggesting the whole of \"&#945;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#957; &#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#965; &#964;&#959;&#965; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#965; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#965;\" is interpolated. Could you bold the portions of the text you think are inauthentic?\n \n \nThere are a number of scholars who feel that it was an interpolation.\n\n \n Not really.

Here are the quotes of Josephus though in english and in the greek only in 18.3.3.\n Antiquities 18.3.3. \"Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was the Christ; and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him, for he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct to this day.\"\n \n Here is the text in Greek.\n \n Ginetai de kata touton ton chronon I\u00cdsous sophos an\u00cdr, eige andra auton legein chr\u00cd: \u00cdn gar paradox\u00d9n erg\u00d9n poi\u00cdt\u00cds, didaskalos anthr\u00d9p\u00d9n t\u00d9n h\u00cddon\u00cdi tal\u00cdth\u00cd dechomen\u00d9n, kai pollous men Ioudaious, pollous de kai tou Hell\u00cdnikou ep\u00cdgageto: ho christos houtos \u00cdn. kai auton endeixei t\u00d9n pr\u00d9t\u00d9n andr\u00d9n par' h\u00cdmin staur\u00d9i epitetim\u00cdkotos Pilatou ouk epausanto hoi to pr\u00d9ton agap\u00cdsantes: ephan\u00cd gar autois trit\u00cdn ech\u00d9n h\u00cdmeran palin z\u00d9n t\u00d9n thei\u00d9n proph\u00cdt\u00d9n tauta te kai alla muria peri autou thaumasia eir\u00cdkot\u00d9n. eis eti te nun t\u00d9n Christian\u00d9n apo toude \u00d9nomasmenon ouk epelipe to phulon.\n \n \n And here's the 20.9.1 Reference to Jesus\n The following passage contains the shorter reference to Jesus.\n \n Antiquities 20.9.1. \"And now Caesar, upon hearing the death of Festus, sent Albinus into Judea, as procurator. But the king deprived Joseph of the high priesthood, and bestowed the succession to that dignity on the son of Ananus, who was also himself called Ananus. Now the report goes that this eldest Ananus proved a most fortunate man; for he had five sons who had all performed the office of a high priest to God, and who had himself enjoyed that dignity a long time formerly, which had never happened to any other of our high priests. But this younger Ananus, who, as we have told you already, took the high priesthood, was a bold man in his temper, and very insolent; he was also of the sect of the Sadducees, who are very rigid in judging offenders, above all the rest of the Jews, as we have already observed; when, therefore, Ananus was of this disposition, he thought he had now a proper opportunity. Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrim of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned: but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens, and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they disliked what was done; they also sent to the king, desiring him to send to Ananus that he should act so no more, for that what he had already done was not to be justified; nay, some of them went also to meet Albinus, as he was upon his journey from Alexandria, and informed him that it was not lawful for Ananus to assemble a sanhedrim without his consent. Whereupon Albinus complied with what they said, and wrote in anger to Ananus, and threatened that he would bring him to punishment for what he had done; on which king Agrippa took the high priesthood from him, when he had ruled but three months, and made Jesus, the son of Damneus, high priest.\"\n But I like and agree with your response to trebor just fine, so keep it up. \n \n This 20.9.1 is what trebor was misquoting in his critique here though.

Now the report goes that this eldest Ananus proved a most fortunate man; for he had five sons who had all performed the office of a high priest to God, and who had himself enjoyed that dignity a long time formerly, which had never happened to any other of our high priests. But this younger Ananus, who, as we have told you already, took the high priesthood, was a bold man in his temper, and very insolent; he was also of the sect of the Sadducees, who are very rigid in judging offenders, above all the rest of the Jews, as we have already observed; when, therefore, Ananus was of this disposition, he thought he had now a proper opportunity. Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrim of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned: but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens, and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they disliked what was done; they also sent to the king, desiring him to send to Ananus that he should act so no more, for that what he had already done was not to be justified; nay, some of them went also to meet Albinus, as he was upon his journey from Alexandria, and informed him that it was not lawful for Ananus to assemble a sanhedrim without his consent. Whereupon Albinus complied with what they said, and wrote in anger to Ananus, and threatened that he would bring him to punishment for what he had done; on which king Agrippa took the high priesthood from him, when he had ruled but three months, and made Jesus, the son of Damneus, high priest.\"[/INDENT]",

In Greek it means simply \"wetted\" or \"anointed.\" Within the Jewish world, this was an extremely significant term because anointing was the means by which the kings and high priests of Israel had been installed. The pouring of oil over their heads represented their assumption of God-given authority (Exod 29:9; 1 Sam 10:1). The same Hebrew word for \"anointed\" was mashiach, which we know usually as the noun Messiah, \"the anointed [one].\" Although used in the OT of reigning kings and high priests, many Jews of Jesus' day looked forward to an end-time prophet, priest, king, or someone else who would be duly anointed.\n \n But for someone who did not know the Jewish tradition, the adjective \"wetted\" would sound most peculiar. Why would Josephus say that this man Jesus was \"the Wetted\"? We can see the puzzlement of Greek-speaking readers over this term in their descriptions of Christianity: Jesus' name is sometimes altered to \"Chrestus\" (Suetonius, Claudius 25.4), a common slave name that would amke better sense, and the Christians are sometimes called \"Chrestians.\"\n \n Since Josephus is usually sensitive to his audience and pauses to explain unfamiliar terms or aspects of Jewish life, it is very strange that he would make the bald assertion, without explanation, that Jesus was \"Christ.\" \n ",

The next is Simon in the second, and this is only known by way of Y.Taanit 4, which was several centuries later.

   " \n This expectation based on OT Prophecies regarding the conquering king is precisely why the Pharisees rejected Jesus, because they wanted that type of Messiah to free them from Rome's control. The OT describes 2 types of Messiah though, the meek savior who dies for our sins as in Isaiah 53, and the conquering King. Both descriptions for each of the two times the Messiah would come. They just got Gods order backwards.\n\n \n \nThis is rubbish exegesis, but not the place to discuss it.\n\n \n This is exactly what is being discussed and I challenge you to support your claim that it is rubbish in any way according to first century jewish thinking. \n \n \nI'm saying certain eschatologically-minded Jewish circles expected a plurality of messiahs, not a succession of single messiahs One example of this kind of thinking was already cited (the Community Rule, 1QS). \n\n \n Here's the commentary of the Community Rule, 1QS Art; please show me where it even refers to Messiah at any level of thinking or consideration if you can. \n \n \nThe same sort of thing is also found in the Damascus Document. In both cases the authors imagine an eschatological king (the messiah of Israel) along with an eschatological priest (the messiah of Aaron).\n\n \n Again, here is the translation and commentary of the Damascus Document. The Dead Sea Scrolls--The Damascus Document please show where it is speaking to anything you are attributing to it.\n \n \nThough it doesn't spell it out the way the others do, 1QSa, the so-called \"Messianic Rule,\" has the messiah of Israel subsurvient to a priest. \n\n This document known as the rule of the congregation is like all of these other references, extra biblical and relevant only to the community of the Essenes and not the larger community of Israel. Also,according to Stegman it doesn't say what you imply it does as it refers to Messiah in the singular.\n [INDENT]It was not until 1996 that doubts have arisen about this widely held \n view. According to Hartmut Stegemann,301QSa is the earliest rule-book of \n the Essenes31 and therefore is older than the Damascus Document, but also \n older than columns 5-11 of the Rule of the Community (1QS).32 Stegemann \n \n CHAPTER TWO \n 57 \n \n opposes the idea that 1QSa and 1QSb were designed for the future of the \n Essenes and he also rejects the suggestion made by Licht and Schiffman that \n next to the Royal Messiah a prominent role was reserved for the Priestly \n Messiah.33 He states: \"(...) there is no trace of the Priestly Messiah either in \n 1QSa or in 1QSb, and both works were not composed for some future times, \n but for the present of the Essenes like different parts of 1QS I-XI and CD.\"34 \n The Rule of the Congregation (1QSa) would thus attest to an early stage in \n the development of the Essenes when they were already thinking that the end \n of days was dawning and that the Royal Messiah could come any time. \n The reason for placing 1QSa in future times is mainly given by the \n interpretation of the final section of the rule. 1QSa 2:11-22 is commonly \n interpreted as a description of the messianic or eschatological banquet, \n which is imagined as one special meal.35 Stegemann, however, argues that it \n is more likely that 1QSa 2:11-22 parallels the regulations in 1QS 6:2-6. The \n only difference between the two texts is that 1QSa provides for the special \n occasion in the future when the Messiah may join the assemblies. Thus, the \n last section of the Rule of the Congregation (1QSa) does not envisage one \n specific messianic banquet, but provides rulings for banquets in the present, \n with prescriptions for the possible presence of the Royal Messiah sometime \n in the future.36 This observation has consequences for the interpretation of \n the term\n http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/theology/2007/j.h.w.dorman/c2.pdf\n \n \n A bunch of other little things, like line 5 of 4Q285 which reads \"a priest will command\" after the mentioning of the Prince of the Congregation, similarly suggest at least dual messiahs.\n\n \n Sorry Art, but you are completely misinterpreting what it say's. Here is what lines 4 and 5 say specifically,\n ]\n 4 and the Prince of the Congregation, the Bran[ch of David] will kill him [\n 5by stroke]s and by wounds. And a Priest [of renown (?)] will command] \n You are attributing a shared leadership position to two references when one speaks to the prince (The high Priest) who will kill the true Priest of renown,(Messiah). This is a reference to prophecy\n Dead Sea Scrolls -- War Rule\n \n \nETA: I missed this:\n \n Those canonical texts that exalt the position of High Priest, but also extracanonical stuff like Jubilees (31, and the blessing of Levi paired with the blessing of Judah), 4Q541 and possibly Aramaic Levi.\n\n \n Here's 4Q541 Translated version of http://digilander.libero.it/Hard_Rain/4Q541.pdf show me where it refers to either two, or multiple Messiahs with any type of shared responsibility in overseeing that station.

I said it doesn't spell it out the way the others (i.e. 1QS and CD) do; in other words, there is no explicit mention of dual messiahs. It is, rather, an inference drawn from the subordination of the kingly messiah to priestly rule (\"...[no] one [shall extend] his hand to the first of bread and [the wine] before the priest. Fo[r he shall extend] his hand to the bread first. Afterwa[rds], the messiah of Israel [shall exten]d his hand to the bread.\"\n \n \nSorry Art, but you are completely misinterpreting what it say's. Here is what lines 4 and 5 say specifically,\n ]\n 4 and the Prince of the Congregation, the Bran[ch of David] will kill him [\n 5by stroke]s and by wounds.

This is a reference to prophecy\n Dead Sea Scrolls -- War Rule\n\n \n I have absolutely no idea how or why you equate the Prince of the Congregation with the office of High Priest or why you think he kills the Priest. The Prince of the Congregation is clearly a kingly-type messiah, as evidenced by the language of Isa 11 (\"shoot from the stump of Jesse\"...\"branch of David\"). This also suggests that he is the subject, not the object, of the verb to kill (the stump of Jesse strikes the earth with the rod of his mouth and kills the wicked; 11.4), which is actually reflected the translation you've used.\n \n In other words, we have an eschatological king killing people (presumably the wicked). And although it does not explicitly say he is a messiah, we've also got an eschatological priest poking around.\n \n \nHere's 4Q541 Translated version of http://digilander.libero.it/Hard_Rain/4Q541.pdf show me where it refers to either two, or multiple Messiahs with any type of shared responsibility in overseeing that station. And since when do we combine diverse sources to confirm a single thought?\n\n \n 1) It doesn't mention multiple messiahs, Archangel, and I never said it did. It is important background because of its exalting of the high priesthood.\n \n 2) \"Since when do we combine diverse sources\"? Archangel, messianic thought was influenced by multiple written sources spanning long periods of time. You you should know this, considering just how much goes into the standard fundamentalist Christian conception of Jesus' messiahship.\n \n \nAnyway, here is the book of Jubilees Jubilees Feel free to show me where it describes multiple or dual Messiah's as I can't find it and would like to see it in proper context.\n\n \n Again, I never said it describes multiple or dual messiahs. Jubilees was considered authoritative by the author/s of, e.g. 1QS, and exalts the office of High Priest in chapter 31. Kingly-type messianism developed out of a longing for a return to the Davidic monarchy derived in large part from biblical promises related to that. Simiarly, Jews expecting multiple eschatological figures like a king and priest longed for a return of what they saw as the proper role and function of the High Priest derived from similarly authoritative texts.\n \n \nIn fact, if anything can be deduced from these various extra biblical sources, it is that the pre-messianic Jews were very aware of the 2 descriptions of Messiah, one being a conquering King and another being a sacrificial lamb which you you referred to as rubbish above.\n\n \n No. As i've showed you, there is a clear strain of dual messianism in certain Second Temple texts. On the other hand, not a single one of them suggests a hope for a \"sacrifical lamb.\" Such a belief was only retroactively applied to Jesus by his followers after his surprising death by crucifixion, and not before.",

   "Okay, so I just picked up Mason...\n \n As I expected, the passage trebor quoted (page 165-66 of the 92 edition) is not about An. 20.9.1, but rather the phrase \"&#959; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#951;&#957;\" in An. 18.3.3. Mason regards it as unusal that Josephus would say Jesus was the messiah, and I agree with this, for a multitude of different reasons. However, Mason explicitly says his argument about the lack of explanation does not apply to An. 20.9.1, which he regards as authentic for the same reason I said. Namely:\n \n \nHe has not used this term before and will only use it again when he calls James the \"brother of Jesus, the one called Christ\" (Ant. 20.200). That formulation, \"the one called Christ,\" makes much better sense because it sounds like a nick-name. Nick-names were necessary among first-century Jews because there was a relatively small number of proper names in circulation. We have already met several people with the name Jesus (=Joshua), and the index to Josephus' writings list some twenty-one individuals with this name. So it would make sense for Josephus to say, \"This man had the nickname Christos,\" and he could do so without further explanation. But simply to say that Jesus was Christ, or Messiah, is a peculiar formulation. [pg. 166]\n\n \n It should also be noted that despite this, Mason agrees with the (slim) majority of scholars who regard the Testimonium as partially authentic (pg. 174).\n \n Anyway trebor, there is no doubt that this was a quote-mine. I don't know if you did it yourself or just swallowed whatever some website said whole, but in either case, it's really bad form.",

   "\"Look, this is my opinion based on significant information I have gathered.\"\n \n For an \"opinion\" you sure have a lot of \"fact\" you feel you're spreading around... of course you're wrong as a closet full of left shoes for man with one right foot. But hey... You're not offending me, you just aren't making yourself look too good either - you know, just an FYI... You of course know that \"information\" isn't always factual... it is what it is, information; and in this case - information is something convenient to your disposition. I would try basic intellectual honest before making such strident claims... \n \n \"It is not my purpose to have Christians stirred up over writings I present. You have your opinion, based on the scriptures of which I have much difficulty. Let's just leave it at that for now.\"\n \n \n Sure it wasn't...\n \n \n \n \"There is no proof that Jesus existed.\"\n \n First off, you have no ability to look at anything objectively - you are secularist and shouldn't even be discussing the subject in all honesty... but as is the case with most intellectually dishonest - they go tinkering and attempt to discredit what has already been lived, accepted and examined by those on both sides of the fence of belief, notice I said belief, not existence. You may reject Christ to your own detriment all you want, that is your choice - it isn't a great one but hey... it's yours. But to say the Son of man didn't live or walk this earth is unreasonable on its face. So, my question to you would be - how did you come to this grand conclusion of yours?\n \n Secondly:\n \n Jesus was born at the time of a Roman census... now what's funny about that were the events that followed from heads of state where public records were on account for what was done. Scripture there is infalible... because it predicted what woul dhappen before it happened - quite accurately. It's your \"recollections\" that are suspect... entirely. Joseph and Mary have to return [by rule of Augustus] to the land of their birth... Joseph registered he, and a wife with child. When the child was born, the provincial powers that be [namely] the Herod [not Antipas] thought his rule to be in jeopardy, the three wise visitors came by to see him, and were instructed by imperial order to let Herod know where the child was - they knew what he was up to and fled. That is when the next thing you can't argue down took place - the mass infanticide that took place later in pursuit of the baby Savior... Herod never found him.\n \n \n Lastly:\n \n You obviously are ignorant to what the word \"testament\" means... when witnesses go before the court, they \"testify\" as to their recollection of events as they occurred. The New \"Witness\" [as it were] was written by men who were called Apostles, the word apostle comes from the same word we get our word witness from... because, they were chosen by Christ for specific gifts to be used by God to carry on Christs' ministry and record His acts... you were only called Apostle our of the group of disciples if you actually were witness of Christ's resurection... that much was clear.\n \n Mathew, Mark Luke and John [Jesus's Brother] were all witness to Christ's resurrection - for without Christ's resurrection your argument would have validity, but because he did - he makes you out to be the charlatan here.\n \n \n \"It would be difficult to credit the Bible generally (and the gospels in particular) as proof of anything. It is, at best, anecdotal evidence, viz. stories whose authorship cannot be authenticated and which cannot be corroborated except by other hearsay evidence. Although there are references in the Scriptures of persons, places and events whose existence can be corroborated by other historical records, it is hard to credit the story of Jesus in the gospels as anything more than fable.\"\n \n You can dismiss it as fable all you want... but the conviction you feel when you cross certain moral boundaries isn't fable is it? The truth are running from is only myth now isn't it? So much so... your contrived arguments aren't doing much to convince those otherwise... Ever hear of the word Autopgrypha [actual copies] and Apocrypha [rejected books]? out of any book ever written, the Bible has to be the most faithfully executed copies in history. Now, they didn't have copy machines back then, otherwise you'd have even less excuse... the Autopgrypha are the original copies of the Gospels. We have those... not to many original manuscripts, but very, very carefully copied autographs. You speak with certainty about things you cannot even substatiate... mainly your repeat-it-til-you-believe hand me down critiques that are age old... and simply aren't substatiated. Now... you'd have to tell Josephus, and Pliny the Younger that Christ didn't exist either... of the Roman scribes that wrote on Pontius Pilot's release of Christ to the Pharisee's for crucifixion. You have many holes in you disbelief there buddy... if you're gonna deny something - have hard evidence, to validate your denial - to which you have none, just hand me done conjecture and wishful thinking of misplaced faith in your disorganized counter-religious antics.\n \n \n \"The four gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) cannot be authenticated; and even if they could, they cannot be proved to be contemporary accounts as witnesses to the events described or even recorded recollection.\" \n \n Refer to the above...\n \n \"They were most likely popular stories handed down by verbal tradition and miscellaneous writings of the early Christian sects,\"\n \n You give people more ammunition to be a bit incredulous about your hysterical rants... because there is nothing historical about them. I seriously hope you don't think yourself too clever in coffeehouse debates you may engage in spouting all this disinformation. Certainly anyone within earshot is definately dumber having even heard it even by accident. You couldn't have \"early Christian sects\" before Christ's ascension, and certainly not befoe the day of Pentecost... because there would have been nothing to hand down. Listen, this is where you I think you really need to stop - you're beating yourself up hear.\n \n \n Clever language used in your pseudo-intellectual rant here doesn't make your argument look more viable or valid... it reveals you are way out of your league.\n \n \"which were later collected and revised under the support of the Church (not all of the gospels were approved), and eventually translated into Latin by St. Jerome in the 4th Century A.D.\" \n \n This misinformation has been floating around with liberal bible scholars for a while. In case you wanted to know... scripture was canonized before then. It was canonized before the Nycean Council of 375 AD where the Nycean Creed was developed - you have some learning to do. Do no confuse Catholic actions with Christian actions... they secularized rather quickly and by the 11th century, more interested in power and growth of the church for their purposes [huh.. sounds like some politicians I know] the ecumenical council in the form of the consul of Trent set what doctrines would be followed from then on - Tyndale was outed and tortured because he would not cave to the secularists within the church, so get your history straight...\n \n \"The English Bible, as stated supra, is even more &#8220;attenuated&#8221;, being translated by William Tyndale, who used the Hebrew and Greek texts and not the Latin Vulgate; which translation was later revised (and edited) as the King James Version. To argue over which version of the Scriptures is correct is merely to argue the question.\"\n \n Tyndale who strived for a more accurate translation and to avoid having to translate the Apocrypha as canan as well had gained the permission by King James to print the texts in his name. The Catholic church didn't want any layman to have access to scripture [sound even more familiar?] King James authorized it and it was printed... Thus one of the tenets for the Protestsant revolt by Martin Luther later... The Pope branded Tyndale a heretic and had him burned alive. Now... you'll have even more trouble in your quest to discredit Scripture, but you have to get around God [in his foreknowledge] choosing very common tongues of the day to spread the Truth of His Word. Aramaic was very common and so was Koinae Greek... Paul, Peter, Timothy, Titus, Barnabas and Bartholomew all spoke both. Greek and Latin were both common in school to learn even up to the 19th century in certain areas, I'm sorry you didn't get those crib notes.\n \n \n \"For the same reason, it is debatable that these texts can even be relied upon as an historical record.\"\n \n Geology and History don't change because you don't believe in God - the Bible to this day is becoming more and more of a source even secularists are turning to because the time tables are so accurate, and the acrcheology stands up to the scrutiny of even the most hardened skeptic.\n \n \"For example, we know a great deal more about Pontius Pilate than we do about Jesus.\"\n \n Not really... but that is where your focus is. Pilate was in big trouble with Ceasar - because he couldn't keep the peace in Judea, three times he was charged with quelling uprising there with the Jews in his day... that is why he \"washed his hands\" of the matter with Christ seeing no issue with Him directly but more sectarian bickering between the Pahrisee's [the conservatives] and the Saducee's [the nutters] - thinking to absolve the Roman court system of the matter, and it didn't do that at all.\n \n \"Pilate was a Roman aristocrat, a knight of the equestrian class, and appointed Procurator of Judea as representative of the Emperor Tiberius. The historical references to Jesus, on the other hand, are sketchy at best. Philo of Alexandria, who was a contemporary of Jesus and Paul, does not mention Christ or the Christians; and the brief account of Flavius Josephus in the Testamonium Flavianum (C.E. 93) appears to have been added by a later hand. Even the reference by Tacitus is second-hand hearsay (probably from his friend and correspondent Pliny the Younger, who was Governor of Bithynia, and would have had access to the historical records and reports of the region). See Annals, 15.53.\"\n \n \n Your cursory perusal of the Josephus's records is meritless and moot... there was no record to manipulate, anymore than Pliny the Youngers... they both collaborate events surrounding Christs walk on this earth. So you have to show where they both are off their rocker - they reported the same thing, there are temple kiosks near the Areopogus... not too far from Mars Hill where the Apostle Paul reasoned with Greek pagans, stoics, epicureans and Hellenists.\n \n \n \n \n \"The proof (or disproof) of an alleged fact is determined by evidence of which there are many kinds, e.g., physical evidence, testimonial evidence, opinion evidence, demonstrative evidence, scientific evidence, etc.; and what is required to prove an asserted fact depends on the matter in question, and the probative value of the relevant evidence of it. In this respect, the Bible is no more relevant than other ancient literary works such as Homer as proof. Questions of this sort require one to assume as true what may not be prone to proof; which presumptions invariably result in irrational arguments that get nowhere.\"\n \n \n It figures you'd drag Homer into this... but he never had copies\" of his stories; fable kept his mythology alive. Proof is what can be evidenced.... and evidence is what has already proven. Fact: Jesus Christ was born here on earth, in Nazareth in an inn keepers manger. Fact: Jesus Christ was tried in a Roman tribunal and put to death. Fact: Jesus Christ rose again bearing out centuries of prophesy bringing salvation to mankind by God incarnate Himslelf... Jesus the Christ. More than 500 people witnessed the risen Christ as He prepared for the second part of his ministry to begin... His Ascension. To which there were secular witnesses to this as well. You ignore that and present only what is convenient to your bent... that we call subjective, and so is your evaluation for what you claim to be false. God in His infinate wisdom knows His Creation... he gave us just enough physical evidence to reason with and understand He is real, and not deny His claims, and just enough external evidence supernaturally that must be observed by faith... other wise it wouldn't take faith now would it. Christinaity above all things is logical and at the heart is reason... God never expects man to reject logic to follow Him, but He will take conventional \"wisdom\" and turn it on its ear to proclaim His glory. We are complex beings... who are \"fearfully and wondefully made\" according to His word, I encourage you to investigate what you are attemtping to evade and discredit.\n \n \"The truth is that the Scriptures are just not intended to be subject to such critical examination; and to argue the validity of the numerous texts, again, merely begs the question. You can argue it forever, but it will bring you no closer to the truth.\"\n \n No.. that is what you need it to be to justify how you want to live... but what you should know what scripture actually says about itself:\n \n \"All Scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,\" -II Timothy 3:16\n \n The word \"inspiration\" translated from the original Greek texts means \"God Breathed\" which means He is in control... not you or me, or our feelings. But exactly what He intended to communicate - by the good intention of His will for those are \"...called according to His purpose\" and there has been no secular writing that has been even close to the benefit to mankind as God's Word, and none of these remedial refutations of yours stand to reason in tearing them down - but look more for attacking something you clearly don't understand. I'd stay away from the history channel too... they don't know what they're talking about either.\n \n \n \n \n -That Darn Republican",

You may reject Christ to your own detriment all you want, that is your choice - it isn't a great one but hey... it's yours. But to say the Son of man didn't live or walk this earth is unreasonable on its face. So, my question to you would be - how did you come to this grand conclusion of yours?\n \n\n \n The lack of evidence outside the bible that he existed of course... we can examine the claims, one at a time if you wish. \n \n \n\n Secondly:\n \n Jesus was born at the time of a Roman census... now what's funny about that were the events that followed from heads of state where public records were on account for what was done. \n \n\n \n That is , of course, according to Luke, who could have very well been using \n Jospehus' Antiquities as a historical source (at least there is some evidence of that). However, there is no evidence of a census ordered by augustus to deal with Judah before 6 c.e... and Matthew has him being born during the reign of Herod the King, making a nice little contradiction there.\n \n \n\n Scripture there is infalible... because it predicted what woul dhappen before it happened - quite accurately. \n \n\n \n It's easy to predict things after the fact. I predict Obama will win in 2008. See how easy it is? Other than that, vague references, out of context quotes, items written to by claiming they are predictions when they aren't make up the 'prophecies'\n \n \n\n It's your \"recollections\" that are suspect... entirely. Joseph and Mary have to return [by rule of Augustus] to the land of their birth... Joseph registered he, and a wife with child. When the child was born, the provincial powers that be [namely] the Herod [not Antipas] thought his rule to be in jeopardy, the three wise visitors came by to see him, and were instructed by imperial order to let Herod know where the child was - they knew what he was up to and fled. That is when the next thing you can't argue down took place - the mass infanticide that took place later in pursuit of the baby Savior... Herod never found him.\n \n\n \n That is according to Luke.. that is in contradiction to what Matthew said. \n \n Contradictions , mind you, that are totally rationalized away or ignored by Christians.\n \n \n \n\n \n You obviously are ignorant to what the word \"testament\" means... when witnesses go before the court, they \"testify\" as to their recollection of events as they occurred. The New \"Witness\" [as it were] was written by men who were called Apostles, the word apostle comes from the same word we get our word witness from... because, they were chosen by Christ for specific gifts to be used by God to carry on Christs' ministry and record His acts... you were only called Apostle our of the group of disciples if you actually were witness of Christ's resurection... that much was clear.\n \n Mathew, Mark Luke and John [Jesus's Brother] were all witness to Christ's resurrection - for without Christ's resurrection your argument would have validity, but because he did - he makes you out to be the charlatan here.\n \n\n You are making the assumption that the people to whom the gospels are attributed are the writers, and they actually knew Jesus. The evidence shows otherwise. And of course, just because someone made a 'testament' doesn't mean it's true. Using the bible to prove the bible is known as 'circular reasoning' \n \n \n\n \"It would be difficult to credit the Bible generally (and the gospels in particular) as proof of anything. It is, at best, anecdotal evidence, viz. stories whose authorship cannot be authenticated and which cannot be corroborated except by other hearsay evidence. Although there are references in the Scriptures of persons, places and events whose existence can be corroborated by other historical records, it is hard to credit the story of Jesus in the gospels as anything more than fable.\"\n \n You can dismiss it as fable all you want... but the conviction you feel when you cross certain moral boundaries isn't fable is it? The truth are running from is only myth now isn't it? So much so... your contrived arguments aren't doing much to convince those otherwise... Ever hear of the word Autopgrypha [actual copies] and Apocrypha [rejected books]? out of any book ever written, the Bible has to be the most faithfully executed copies in history. Now, they didn't have copy machines back then, otherwise you'd have even less excuse... the Autopgrypha are the original copies of the Gospels. We have those... not to many original manuscripts, but very, very carefully copied autographs. You speak with certainty about things you cannot even substatiate... mainly your repeat-it-til-you-believe hand me down critiques that are age old... and simply aren't substatiated. Now... you'd have to tell Josephus, and Pliny the Younger that Christ didn't exist either... of the Roman scribes that wrote on Pontius Pilot's release of Christ to the Pharisee's for crucifixion. You have many holes in you disbelief there buddy... if you're gonna deny something - have hard evidence, to validate your denial - to which you have none, just hand me done conjecture and wishful thinking of misplaced faith in your disorganized counter-religious antics.\n \n\n \n Well, it certainly has been copied the most. That does not mean it was true. It just means that believers liked to make copies. Let's look at your so called 'extra biblical' evidence of 'Ponitius Pilate release of Christ', and see what the experts think about it. Forgeries and lies aren't good evidence, and lets take a look to see if it is real or a forgery.\n \n There was , after all, the well known forgery of the letters of Pilate.\n \n \n\n \"The four gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) cannot be authenticated; and even if they could, they cannot be proved to be contemporary accounts as witnesses to the events described or even recorded recollection.\" \n \n Refer to the above...\n \n \"They were most likely popular stories handed down by verbal tradition and miscellaneous writings of the early Christian sects,\"\n \n You give people more ammunition to be a bit incredulous about your hysterical rants... because there is nothing historical about them. I seriously hope you don't think yourself too clever in coffeehouse debates you may engage in spouting all this disinformation. Certainly anyone within earshot is definately dumber having even heard it even by accident. You couldn't have \"early Christian sects\" before Christ's ascension, and certainly not befoe the day of Pentecost... because there would have been nothing to hand down. Listen, this is where you I think you really need to stop - you're beating yourself up hear.\n \n\n \n Let's see you provide evidence rather than a rant.

Its logic and rationale is unquestionable to any reasonable person. Which explains your difficulty with it.\n Ancient Evidence for Jesus \n from Non-Christian Sources\n \n Written by Michael Gleghorn \n \n Evidence from Tacitus\n Although there is overwhelming evidence that the New Testament is an accurate and trustworthy historical document, many people are still reluctant to believe what it says unless there is also some independent, non-biblical testimony that corroborates its statements. In the introduction to one of his books, F.F. Bruce tells about a Christian correspondent who was told by an agnostic friend that \"apart from obscure references in Josephus and the like,\" there was no historical evidence for the life of Jesus outside the Bible.{1} This, he wrote to Bruce, had caused him \"great concern and some little upset in [his] spiritual life.\"{2} He concludes his letter by asking, \"Is such collateral proof available, and if not, are there reasons for the lack of it?\"{3} The answer to this question is, \"Yes, such collateral proof is available,\" and we will be looking at some of it in this article.\n \n Let's begin our inquiry with a passage that historian Edwin Yamauchi calls \"probably the most important reference to Jesus outside the New Testament.\"{4} Reporting on Emperor Nero's decision to blame the Christians for the fire that had destroyed Rome in A.D. 64, the Roman historian Tacitus wrote:\n \n Nero fastened the guilt . . . on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of . . . Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome. . . .{5}\n \n What all can we learn from this ancient (and rather unsympathetic) reference to Jesus and the early Christians? Notice, first, that Tacitus reports Christians derived their name from a historical person called Christus (from the Latin), or Christ. He is said to have \"suffered the extreme penalty,\" obviously alluding to the Roman method of execution known as crucifixion. This is said to have occurred during the reign of Tiberius and by the sentence of Pontius Pilatus. This confirms much of what the Gospels tell us about the death of Jesus.\n \n But what are we to make of Tacitus' rather enigmatic statement that Christ's death briefly checked \"a most mischievous superstition,\" which subsequently arose not only in Judaea, but also in Rome? One historian suggests that Tacitus is here \"bearing indirect . . . testimony to the conviction of the early church that the Christ who had been crucified had risen from the grave.\"{6} While this interpretation is admittedly speculative, it does help explain the otherwise bizarre occurrence of a rapidly growing religion based on the worship of a man who had been crucified as a criminal.{7} How else might one explain that?\n \n Evidence from Pliny the Younger\n Another important source of evidence about Jesus and early Christianity can be found in the letters of Pliny the Younger to Emperor Trajan. Pliny was the Roman governor of Bithynia in Asia Minor. In one of his letters, dated around A.D. 112, he asks Trajan's advice about the appropriate way to conduct legal proceedings against those accused of being Christians.{8} Pliny says that he needed to consult the emperor about this issue because a great multitude of every age, class, and sex stood accused of Christianity.{9}\n \n At one point in his letter, Pliny relates some of the information he has learned about these Christians:\n \n They were in the habit of meeting on a certain fixed day before it was light, when they sang in alternate verses a hymn to Christ, as to a god, and bound themselves by a solemn oath, not to any wicked deeds, but never to commit any fraud, theft or adultery, never to falsify their word, nor deny a trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up; after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble to partake of food--but food of an ordinary and innocent kind.{10}\n \n This passage provides us with a number of interesting insights into the beliefs and practices of early Christians. First, we see that Christians regularly met on a certain fixed day for worship. Second, their worship was directed to Christ, demonstrating that they firmly believed in His divinity. Furthermore, one scholar interprets Pliny's statement that hymns were sung to Christ, as to a god, as a reference to the rather distinctive fact that, \"unlike other gods who were worshipped, Christ was a person who had lived on earth.\"{11} If this interpretation is correct, Pliny understood that Christians were worshipping an actual historical person as God! Of course, this agrees perfectly with the New Testament doctrine that Jesus was both God and man.\n \n Not only does Pliny's letter help us understand what early Christians believed about Jesus' person, it also reveals the high esteem to which they held His teachings. For instance, Pliny notes that Christians bound themselves by a solemn oath not to violate various moral standards, which find their source in the ethical teachings of Jesus. In addition, Pliny's reference to the Christian custom of sharing a common meal likely alludes to their observance of communion and the \"love feast.\"{12} This interpretation helps explain the Christian claim that the meal was merely food of an ordinary and innocent kind. They were attempting to counter the charge, sometimes made by non-Christians, of practicing \"ritual cannibalism.\"{13} The Christians of that day humbly repudiated such slanderous attacks on Jesus' teachings. We must sometimes do the same today.\n \n Evidence from Josephus\n Perhaps the most remarkable reference to Jesus outside the Bible can be found in the writings of Josephus, a first century Jewish historian. On two occasions, in his Jewish Antiquities, he mentions Jesus. The second, less revealing, reference describes the condemnation of one \"James\" by the Jewish Sanhedrin. This James, says Josephus, was \"the brother of Jesus the so-called Christ.\"{14} F.F. Bruce points out how this agrees with Paul's description of James in Galatians 1:19 as \"the Lord's brother.\"{15} And Edwin Yamauchi informs us that \"few scholars have questioned\" that Josephus actually penned this passage.{16}\n \n As interesting as this brief reference is, there is an earlier one, which is truly astonishing. Called the \"Testimonium Flavianum,\" the relevant portion declares:\n \n About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he . . . wrought surprising feats. . . . He was the Christ. When Pilate . . .condemned him to be crucified, those who had . . . come to love him did not give up their affection for him. On the third day he appeared . . . restored to life. . . . And the tribe of Christians . . . has . . . not disappeared.{17}\n \n Did Josephus really write this? Most scholars think the core of the passage originated with Josephus, but that it was later altered by a Christian editor, possibly between the third and fourth century A.D.{18} But why do they think it was altered? Josephus was not a Christian, and it is difficult to believe that anyone but a Christian would have made some of these statements.{19}\n \n For instance, the claim that Jesus was a wise man seems authentic, but the qualifying phrase, \"if indeed one ought to call him a man,\" is suspect. It implies that Jesus was more than human, and it is quite unlikely that Josephus would have said that! It is also difficult to believe he would have flatly asserted that Jesus was the Christ, especially when he later refers to Jesus as \"the so-called\" Christ. Finally, the claim that on the third day Jesus appeared to His disciples restored to life, inasmuch as it affirms Jesus' resurrection, is quite unlikely to come from a non-Christian!\n \n But even if we disregard the questionable parts of this passage, we are still left with a good deal of corroborating information about the biblical Jesus. We read that he was a wise man who performed surprising feats. And although He was crucified under Pilate, His followers continued their discipleship and became known as Christians. When we combine these statements with Josephus' later reference to Jesus as \"the so-called Christ,\" a rather detailed picture emerges which harmonizes quite well with the biblical record. It increasingly appears that the \"biblical Jesus\" and the \"historical Jesus\" are one and the same!\n \n Evidence from the Babylonian Talmud\n There are only a few clear references to Jesus in the Babylonian Talmud, a collection of Jewish rabbinical writings compiled between approximately A.D. 70-500. Given this time frame, it is naturally supposed that earlier references to Jesus are more likely to be historically reliable than later ones. In the case of the Talmud, the earliest period of compilation occurred between A.D. 70-200.{20} The most significant reference to Jesus from this period states:\n \n On the eve of the Passover Yeshu was hanged. For forty days before the execution took place, a herald . . . cried, \"He is going forth to be stoned because he has practiced sorcery and enticed Israel to apostasy.\"{21}\n \n Let's examine this passage. You may have noticed that it refers to someone named \"Yeshu.\" So why do we think this is Jesus? Actually, \"Yeshu\" (or \"Yeshua\") is how Jesus' name is pronounced in Hebrew. But what does the passage mean by saying that Jesus \"was hanged\"? Doesn't the New Testament say he was crucified? Indeed it does. But the term \"hanged\" can function as a synonym for \"crucified.\" For instance, Galatians 3:13 declares that Christ was \"hanged\", and Luke 23:39 applies this term to the criminals who were crucified with Jesus.{22} So the Talmud declares that Jesus was crucified on the eve of Passover. But what of the cry of the herald that Jesus was to be stoned? This may simply indicate what the Jewish leaders were planning to do.{23} If so, Roman involvement changed their plans!{24}\n \n The passage also tells us why Jesus was crucified. It claims He practiced sorcery and enticed Israel to apostasy! Since this accusation comes from a rather hostile source, we should not be too surprised if Jesus is described somewhat differently than in the New Testament. But if we make allowances for this, what might such charges imply about Jesus?\n \n Interestingly, both accusations have close parallels in the canonical gospels. For instance, the charge of sorcery is similar to the Pharisees' accusation that Jesus cast out demons \"by Beelzebul the ruler of the demons.\"{25} But notice this: such a charge actually tends to confirm the New Testament claim that Jesus performed miraculous feats. Apparently Jesus' miracles were too well attested to deny. The only alternative was to ascribe them to sorcery! Likewise, the charge of enticing Israel to apostasy parallels Luke's account of the Jewish leaders who accused Jesus of misleading the nation with his teaching.{26} Such a charge tends to corroborate the New Testament record of Jesus' powerful teaching ministry. Thus, if read carefully, this passage from the Talmud confirms much of our knowledge about Jesus from the New Testament.\n \n Evidence from Lucian\n Lucian of Samosata was a second century Greek satirist. In one of his works, he wrote of the early Christians as follows:\n \n The Christians . . . worship a man to this day--the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites, and was crucified on that account. . . . [It] was impressed on them by their original lawgiver that they are all brothers, from the moment that they are converted, and deny the gods of Greece, and worship the crucified sage, and live after his laws.{27}\n \n Although Lucian is jesting here at the early Christians, he does make some significant comments about their founder. For instance, he says the Christians worshipped a man, \"who introduced their novel rites.\" And though this man's followers clearly thought quite highly of Him, He so angered many of His contemporaries with His teaching that He \"was crucified on that account.\"\n \n Although Lucian does not mention his name, he is clearly referring to Jesus. But what did Jesus teach to arouse such wrath? According to Lucian, he taught that all men are brothers from the moment of their conversion. That's harmless enough. But what did this conversion involve? It involved denying the Greek gods, worshipping Jesus, and living according to His teachings. It's not too difficult to imagine someone being killed for teaching that. Though Lucian doesn't say so explicitly, the Christian denial of other gods combined with their worship of Jesus implies the belief that Jesus was more than human. Since they denied other gods in order to worship Him, they apparently thought Jesus a greater God than any that Greece had to offer!\n \n Let's summarize what we've learned about Jesus from this examination of ancient non-Christian sources. First, both Josephus and Lucian indicate that Jesus was regarded as wise. Second, Pliny, the Talmud, and Lucian imply He was a powerful and revered teacher. Third, both Josephus and the Talmud indicate He performed miraculous feats. Fourth, Tacitus, Josephus, the Talmud, and Lucian all mention that He was crucified. Tacitus and Josephus say this occurred under Pontius Pilate. And the Talmud declares it happened on the eve of Passover. Fifth, there are possible references to the Christian belief in Jesus' resurrection in both Tacitus and Josephus. Sixth, Josephus records that Jesus' followers believed He was the Christ, or Messiah. And finally, both Pliny and Lucian indicate that Christians worshipped Jesus as God!\n \n I hope you see how this small selection of ancient non-Christian sources helps corroborate our knowledge of Jesus from the gospels. Of course, there are many ancient Christian sources of information about Jesus as well. But since the historical reliability of the canonical gospels is so well established, I invite you to read those for an authoritative \"life of Jesus!\"",

   "Julius Caesar left little behind in the way of personal writings? You cannot be serious?!emoticon_confused\n\n \n I am absolutely serious radius, and what is attributed to him were self serving descriptions of his military campaigns which served to further his political career. Accordingly, there are only 2 which are conclusively attributed to him having personally written.\n Caesar was considered during his lifetime to be one of the best orators and authors of prose in Rome-even Cicero spoke highly of Caesar's rhetoric and style.[123] Among his most famous works were his funeral oration for his paternal aunt Julia and his Anticato, a document written to blacken Cato's reputation and respond to Cicero's Cato memorial. Unfortunately, the majority of his works and speeches have been lost.\n Memoirs\n \n \n Commentarii de Bello Gallico, an account written by Julius Caesar about his nine years of war in Gaul.\n The Commentarii de Bello Gallico (Commentaries on the Gallic War), campaigns in Gallia and Britannia during his term as proconsul; and\n The Commentarii de Bello Civili (Commentaries on the Civil War), events of the Civil War until immediately after Pompey's death in Egypt.\n Other works historically attributed to Caesar, but whose authorship is doubted, are:\n De Bello Alexandrino (On the Alexandrine War), campaign in Alexandria;\n De Bello Africo (On the African War), campaigns in North Africa; and\n De Bello Hispaniensi (On the Hispanic War), campaigns in the Iberian peninsula.\n These narratives were written and published on a yearly basis during or just after the actual campaigns, as a sort of \"dispatches from the front\". Apparently simple and direct in style-to the point that Caesar's Commentarii are commonly studied by first and second year Latin students-they are in fact highly sophisticated and subtly slanted advertisements for his political agenda, aimed most particularly at the middle-brow readership of minor aristocrats in Rome, Italy, and the provinces. Julius Caesar - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n So basically, we have a eulogy for a dead Aunt and a political hit piece for Cato. The point is though, that we have uncountable numbers of contemporaries of Jesus who showed dedicated loyalty to Him by actually worshiping Him as their God and willingly dying rather than deny Him as their personal savior, yet so many will accept Caesars existence as undeniable while rejecting that Jesus existed at all.\n \n Since you're new here, let me ask you directly; Are you also denying that Jesus Christ existed at all, or just disagreeing about how much Caesar wrote throughout his career? If you're not denying that Jesus existed, we don't really disagree on much because I wont argue, nor did I claim that Caesar never wrote anything, only that we don't have extensive writings from him or other historical figures which theses same deniers of Christ's existence will accept as having lived. Here is what I said:\n \n But we could also go back to historical characters like Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Homer or any number of ancient thinkers and doers which are referred to in historical records but leave little behind in the area of personal writings.\n \n I also referred to Homer who is credited with writing the Iliad and the Odyssey, as well as of the Homeric Hymns. But today the hymns are considered to be later works but many still regard Homer as the author or compiler of the epics. The ancient Greeks generally believed that Homer was a historical individual, but some modern scholars are skeptical:\n \n So in spite of this person being credited with having written these famous epics, his existence is doubted by modern scholars. I would like to see evidence from modern historians, scholars or theologians who deny that Jesus Christ existed as an historical figure.\n Homer - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

For example, the town of Nazareth, from archeological digs, was shown to be a graveyard with no inhabitants during the Herodian period.\n \n So, the identification of the modern city of Nazareth as the place where Jesus came from can be shown to be false.\n\n \n Care to support this with actual archeological evidence? To imply that the complete town of Nazareth was a graveyard 2000 years ago is absolutely ridiculous. Here, educate yourself. \n Nazareth - location profile\n \n Location and Setting\n \n Nazareth was located on the \"Nazareth Ridge\" that separated the central part of the Plain of Jezreel from the Bet Netofa Valley. The town was sixteen miles west of the Sea of Galilee and four miles southeast of the cosmopolitan city of Sepphoris.\n Galilee normally enjoyed abundant rainfall, in contrast to the central and southern parts of the country. Western breezes brought moisture from the Mediterranean Sea during the rainy season, from October to April . Annual rainfall at Nazareth measured about twenty-five inches, enough to ensure good crops and good pasture.\n Situated some thirteen hundred feet above sea level, Nazareth was relatively inaccessible. Its height and location isolated it from the flow of traffic on the International Coastal Highway on the plain below, as it wound its way from Megiddo to the Sea of Galilee.\n From Nazareth, one could see nearby Sepphoris, four miles to the northwest, perched on its hill. Nine miles north across the Bet Netofa Valley, Cana nestled against one of the hills of Lower Galilee. A short walk to the south brought into view the symmetrical mound of Mount Tabor, rising from the floor of the plain. Beyond it lay the loaf-like Hill of Moreh and farther south, the crescent-shaped Mount Gilboa. Directly west, the hills of the Carmel range shut off a view of the Mediterranean. For the people who lived in Nazareth, every vista could evoke memories of Deborah and Barak, of Gideon, and of Elijah and Elisha.\n Historical and Biblical Significance\n \n The ancient settlement at Nazareth was probably left in ruins about 733 B.C. when Tiglath-Pileser II, the Assyrian conqueror, swept through Galilee. Taking most of the citizens of the Northern Kingdom into exile in Assyria, he replaced them with people from the countries he had conquered. Isaiah&#8217;s lament had come to pass, \"In the past He humbled the land of Zebulon and the land of Naphtali,\" leaving the region to be called \"Galilee of the Gentiles\" (Isa 9:1). As the Maccabean era opened in 167 B.C., only a few isolated Jewish groups were living in Galilee. The Hasmonean conquest of the region by John Hyrcanus (134-104 B.C.), however, opened the way for a significant immigration of Jews from Babylon and Persia. Further, Hyrcanus and his successors forced Gentiles in the region to convert to Judaism or be expelled. By Jesus&#8217; time, the Jewish population predominated in Galilee, as witnessed by the number of synagogues He encountered during His ministry throughout the territory.\n It is likely that a whole clan of the line of David, from the exiled tribe of Judah, returned from Babylon about 100 B.C. and established the town of Nazareth. This may explain why Joseph and Mary, of the tribe of Judah, were to be found so far from Judea. In referring to His reception in Nazareth, Jesus described the citizens of the town as being \"His own relatives and .. . His own household\" (Mark 6:4). (Archaeologists have found no evidence of the site&#8217;s being inhabited during the Persian and early Hellenistic periods, from the eighth to the second centuries B.C.)\n Archaeological research suggests that at the time of Jesus, the population of Nazareth was about 120-150. Probably most of these people would have been related to the one clan, descendants of the group that had returned from Babylon one or two generations earlier.\n Isaiah&#8217;s prophecy, \"Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, and a branch from his roots will bear fruit\" (11:1), identifies Jesus, the coming Messiah as a \"shoot\" (Hebrew netzer, from the verb \"to shine\" or \"blossom\"). Isaiah was not referring to the name of the village (Nazareth) in which the Messiah would live (it did not exist until some six hundred years later). Rather he was relating Messiah to the line of David (Cf. Matt 22:41-46; Rom 1:3). Although Mark writes of Jesus&#8217; coming from Nazareth (1:9), implying that this was His town of origin, Matthew connects Nazareth with the genealogical significance of Nazareth. He writes, \"And came and resided in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, &#8216;He shall be called a Nazarene&#8217;\" (2:23).\n The significance of the name of the village, then, is twofold. It expresses Jesus&#8217; credential as a descendant of David, and therefore from the royal line with the right to rule Israel in a restored kingdom (Cf Acts 1:6). He is a \"Nazarene,\" in the sense that He is the \"shoot,\" the netzer, predicted by Isaiah. Since Nazareth was also the village where He lived most of His life, it also became the means of distinguishing this \"Yeshua\" from the many others in the land. Not knowing the significance of Isaiah&#8217;s use of netzer, Pilate expressed more than he knew when he wrote on the tablet above the cross \"Jesus of Nazareth, king of the Jews.\"\n The size of the village and the origin of the clan at Nazareth adds a deeper dimension to the events surrounding the conception and birth of Jesus. The angel&#8217;s announcement to Mary and his explanation and encouragement to Joseph took place in a very small community that lived in a rather remote village. The return of this family of three, with a toddler, must have evoked a special joy, for the few families there would not likely have produced many babies. In each of these crisis times, Mary&#8217;s pregnancy and the couple&#8217;s return with the toddler, it must be remembered that this village was not populated by hostile strangers. Rather, the residents were a kind of extended family, one that probably could be judgmental but also supportive.\n The small size of the village of Nazareth when Jesus lived there also becomes an important factor in our understanding of reactions to His teaching in its synagogue (Luke 4:16-30). Every one present, of every age, would have known Jesus well. In fact, it may be assumed that several of them may have been related to Him through Mary. A realization of this context helps us to appreciate more fully the significance of Jesus&#8217; reading of Isaiah&#8217;s prophecy concerning Himself (61:1,2) in what may have been the only synagogue in the village. The rejection by His own clan, and their dragging Him out to the edge of the ridge to throw Him down to His death, must have been a very traumatic event for all involved, especially for His mother and brothers and sisters, as well as the towns people who knew Him so well.\n Later in His ministry, Jesus returned to Nazareth, this time with His disciples (Matt 13:54-58; Mark 6:1-6). Again the challenge was for Him to perform miracles there, as He had done elsewhere, thereby giving Nazareth the prestige other towns such as Capernaum enjoyed. And again, the real issue was the person of Jesus. Was He only a physical descendant of David, or did the angel&#8217;s announcement to Mary, in effect, validate His divinity? Jesus&#8217; sad reaction to His neighbors in Nazareth, whom He knew and loved so well, was \"He marveled at their unbelief\" (Mark 6:1).Nazareth - Walking in Their Sandals - location profile\n \n And this also for some archeological evidence: http://dqhall59.com/roman_era_nazareth.htm",

   "Yes, bagatti found tombs there.\n \n The Jewish custom is NOT to live in places there are tombs.\n \n So, what Bagetti discovered is perfectly in line with the article I quoted. Your distortion is not worthy.\n \n Of course, what is NOT found is evidence it was inhabited during the 1st century c.e... The inscription from Caesarea Martinia is from the late 3rd century to early 4th century.\n \n Yes, it became a town during the second century.. but, hey, let's not quibble about details.\n\n \n \nOn the other hand, some things ABOUT the claims about Jesus can be shown to be not quite true. For example, the town of Nazareth, from archeological digs, was shown to be a graveyard with no inhabitants during the Herodian period.\n \n So, the identification of the modern city of Nazareth as the place where Jesus came from can be shown to be false.\n\n \n \nCare to support this with actual archeological evidence? To imply that the complete town of Nazareth was a graveyard 2000 years ago is absolutely ridiculous. Here, educate yourself. \n Nazareth - location profile\n \n Location and Setting\n \n Nazareth was located on the \"Nazareth Ridge\" that separated the central part of the Plain of Jezreel from the Bet Netofa Valley. The town was sixteen miles west of the Sea of Galilee and four miles southeast of the cosmopolitan city of Sepphoris.\n Galilee normally enjoyed abundant rainfall, in contrast to the central and southern parts of the country. Western breezes brought moisture from the Mediterranean Sea during the rainy season, from October to April . Annual rainfall at Nazareth measured about twenty-five inches, enough to ensure good crops and good pasture.\n Situated some thirteen hundred feet above sea level, Nazareth was relatively inaccessible. Its height and location isolated it from the flow of traffic on the International Coastal Highway on the plain below, as it wound its way from Megiddo to the Sea of Galilee.\n From Nazareth, one could see nearby Sepphoris, four miles to the northwest, perched on its hill. Nine miles north across the Bet Netofa Valley, Cana nestled against one of the hills of Lower Galilee. A short walk to the south brought into view the symmetrical mound of Mount Tabor, rising from the floor of the plain. Beyond it lay the loaf-like Hill of Moreh and farther south, the crescent-shaped Mount Gilboa. Directly west, the hills of the Carmel range shut off a view of the Mediterranean. For the people who lived in Nazareth, every vista could evoke memories of Deborah and Barak, of Gideon, and of Elijah and Elisha.\n Historical and Biblical Significance\n \n The ancient settlement at Nazareth was probably left in ruins about 733 B.C. when Tiglath-Pileser II, the Assyrian conqueror, swept through Galilee. Taking most of the citizens of the Northern Kingdom into exile in Assyria, he replaced them with people from the countries he had conquered. Isaiah's lament had come to pass, \"In the past He humbled the land of Zebulon and the land of Naphtali,\" leaving the region to be called \"Galilee of the Gentiles\" (Isa 9:1). As the Maccabean era opened in 167 B.C., only a few isolated Jewish groups were living in Galilee. The Hasmonean conquest of the region by John Hyrcanus (134-104 B.C.), however, opened the way for a significant immigration of Jews from Babylon and Persia. Further, Hyrcanus and his successors forced Gentiles in the region to convert to Judaism or be expelled. By Jesus' time, the Jewish population predominated in Galilee, as witnessed by the number of synagogues He encountered during His ministry throughout the territory.\n It is likely that a whole clan of the line of David, from the exiled tribe of Judah, returned from Babylon about 100 B.C. and established the town of Nazareth. This may explain why Joseph and Mary, of the tribe of Judah, were to be found so far from Judea. In referring to His reception in Nazareth, Jesus described the citizens of the town as being \"His own relatives and .. . His own household\" (Mark 6:4). (Archaeologists have found no evidence of the site's being inhabited during the Persian and early Hellenistic periods, from the eighth to the second centuries B.C.)\n Archaeological research suggests that at the time of Jesus, the population of Nazareth was about 120-150. Probably most of these people would have been related to the one clan, descendants of the group that had returned from Babylon one or two generations earlier.\n Isaiah's prophecy, \"Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, and a branch from his roots will bear fruit\" (11:1), identifies Jesus, the coming Messiah as a \"shoot\" (Hebrew netzer, from the verb \"to shine\" or \"blossom\"). Isaiah was not referring to the name of the village (Nazareth) in which the Messiah would live (it did not exist until some six hundred years later). Rather he was relating Messiah to the line of David (Cf. Matt 22:41-46; Rom 1:3). Although Mark writes of Jesus' coming from Nazareth (1:9), implying that this was His town of origin, Matthew connects Nazareth with the genealogical significance of Nazareth. He writes, \"And came and resided in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, 'He shall be called a Nazarene'\" (2:23).\n The significance of the name of the village, then, is twofold. It expresses Jesus' credential as a descendant of David, and therefore from the royal line with the right to rule Israel in a restored kingdom (Cf Acts 1:6). He is a \"Nazarene,\" in the sense that He is the \"shoot,\" the netzer, predicted by Isaiah. Since Nazareth was also the village where He lived most of His life, it also became the means of distinguishing this \"Yeshua\" from the many others in the land. Not knowing the significance of Isaiah's use of netzer, Pilate expressed more than he knew when he wrote on the tablet above the cross \"Jesus of Nazareth, king of the Jews.\"\n The size of the village and the origin of the clan at Nazareth adds a deeper dimension to the events surrounding the conception and birth of Jesus. The angel's announcement to Mary and his explanation and encouragement to Joseph took place in a very small community that lived in a rather remote village. The return of this family of three, with a toddler, must have evoked a special joy, for the few families there would not likely have produced many babies. In each of these crisis times, Mary's pregnancy and the couple's return with the toddler, it must be remembered that this village was not populated by hostile strangers. Rather, the residents were a kind of extended family, one that probably could be judgmental but also supportive.\n The small size of the village of Nazareth when Jesus lived there also becomes an important factor in our understanding of reactions to His teaching in its synagogue (Luke 4:16-30). Every one present, of every age, would have known Jesus well. In fact, it may be assumed that several of them may have been related to Him through Mary. A realization of this context helps us to appreciate more fully the significance of Jesus' reading of Isaiah's prophecy concerning Himself (61:1,2) in what may have been the only synagogue in the village. The rejection by His own clan, and their dragging Him out to the edge of the ridge to throw Him down to His death, must have been a very traumatic event for all involved, especially for His mother and brothers and sisters, as well as the towns people who knew Him so well.\n Later in His ministry, Jesus returned to Nazareth, this time with His disciples (Matt 13:54-58; Mark 6:1-6). Again the challenge was for Him to perform miracles there, as He had done elsewhere, thereby giving Nazareth the prestige other towns such as Capernaum enjoyed. And again, the real issue was the person of Jesus. Was He only a physical descendant of David, or did the angel's announcement to Mary, in effect, validate His divinity? Jesus' sad reaction to His neighbors in Nazareth, whom He knew and loved so well, was \"He marveled at their unbelief\" (Mark 6:1).Nazareth - Walking in Their Sandals - location profile\n \n And this also for some archeological evidence: Nazareth During the Time of Jesus\n\n \n You persist in making this claim even though evidence which refuted it was posted pages ago. Also, your claim that Jews wouldn't live near cemeteries is equally bogus since we see that Jesus tomb was within walking distance of where he was crucified on Golgotha and the women walked to his tomb from their home on the third day only to find that He was gone. The cemetery was outside the wall as was Golgotha, but that doesn't mean that the land was considered unapproachable as evidenced by the women not hesitating to go there on the third day after His death. Here's a modern map which shows the ancient location of the Garden Tomb, and as you can see, there was a road that went directly to it, meaning the cemetery it was in. The Garden Tomb\n \n As for claiming that Nazareth was a graveyard and uninhabited during the first century? You still haven't produced any evidence. All we get from you are unsubstantiated insistence that you are right.",

That is what the words apostle means 'to witness'... Most importantly they being indwelt by the Holy Spirit [this is more theological than most want to get but is highly relevant] has a very different characteristic. Being a vessel of God's [as Christians are called to be] they were filled with Christ's directions for discipleship. The Canonical Gospels are witness from three very different personality men - not three perspectives. These texts reflect that; but from a former secularists point of view in Mathew to a very refined and educated perspective in Luke who was a doctor, rest assured there weren't soothsaying \"spiritualists\" adding things as they felt... no human would put these prinicples together, they war against our very nature... trust me; God pretty much knew what he was doing. As for secular scribes such as Josephus Flavius and Pliny the Younger... they simply wrote what they saw or was exposed to. Neither on of them has any motivation to discredit Christ... all they did was report what they they saw. People have to remember they weren't walking around with camcorders and tape recorders, if anything was big enough to report - scribes made note of it.\n \n \n \n \"I'm assuming that nobody disputes this?

The Nicaean council was gathered to organized the direction for the Church , the Nicaean creed... and compilation of the book took a while and to wisdom, and spiritual guidance.

I think that most christians accept these tales were made up/fictional due to religious zeal - to me, the canonical ones are not all that different. The canonical gospels are full of impossible things, inconsistencies, signs of historical fabrication, and copying from the Old Testament.\n\n \n Don't you see how weak and dishonest it is to use writings which were rejected as fakes and forgeries from the onset as evidence of any dishonesty by the early church in putting the bible together? And can't you see how dishonest it is to attribute the authorship of these rejected writings to christians when they have been shown to be frauds and rejected by the legitimate church? \n \n And just because you can't appreciate or grasp the miracles in the bible leading you to label them \"impossible things\" does nothing at all to disqualify them as real and valid events which were witnessed by the multitudes at the time.\n \n \nAlready have. The \"He was the Christ\" in Josephus is an obvious interpolation, and therefore accepted as such by christians and non-christians alike. It is simply the most well-known. Texts destroyed because they were religiously-incorrect include those of Arius, Priscillian, Nestorius, Abelard - and all of the texts of the Cathars (along with all of the people). This was not a movement with much interest in the pursuit of truth.\n\n \n You are now blaming acts committed by the Roman Catholics from 300 AD -1300 AD to the legitimate church of Christ? Nestorius rejected the reference of Mary Mother of God and was right, yet since he opposed a corrupted view which the RCC still holds to today, he was defrocked and his writings burned. Why do you blame the legitimate church for these travesties?\n \n \nNo. For example, a lot of what we know about Julius Caesar we know from his political opponents.\n\n \n Just as the historical references to Jesus that I posted early on in this thread were by unbelievers and opponents of Christianity.

Josephus Flavius had nothing to gain by what he reported, but you instance that his records were somehow not true... and you're the only one in this thread making that absurd claim... you're nuts if you believe that, there is no truth to it... and where did you get that nonsense from Pliny? He wrote more than a few times of Christ, were you there to witness his skulduggery? No... you were, so the record must stand for what the empirical take-away points are, not just your ad hominem interjections. \n \n\n \n I noticed that although you said 'He wrote more than a few times about Jesus', you never ever show your source, or look at what he really said. Dishonesty, thy name is 'That darn republican'. You know why you don't show what he actually wrote??? Because, what Pliny actually wrote in all his letters don't support what you claim it says. \n \n And, for that matter, you misrepresent the issue about Josephus being a forgery. It isn't Josephus that had a damn thing to do with the passage, but rather it yanked around with in the 4th century. You will not find any reference to the T.F. before it was quoted by a 4th century apologist.\n \n I'll tell you what.. I will give you a source where you can read all of Pliny's letters as they were translated into English, and you can come back with \n how you think that he supports a 'historical Jesus'. His letters just show that there were Christians.\n \n \n Here. .. Go for it. My prediction.. I will see avoidence of the issue, insults and other than that, no evidence forth coming.\n \n Letters of the Younger Pliny, First Series ? Volume 1 by the Younger Pliny - Project Gutenberg",

   "This is a classic example of two logical fallacies, the 'arguement from popularity' and 'arguement from antiquity'. \n \n Hastings was wrong back then , and it is still nonsense now.\n\n \n Specifically what was he wrong about? That the bible hasn't been under unending attacks and scrutiny for centuries? Or that it hasn't survived intact and remains the best selling single volume book on Earth?\n \n List of best-selling books - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n THE BIBLE: A BOOK LIKE NO OTHER\n \n Why We Need This Book\n \n By\n \n Samuel Koranteng-Pipim, PhD.\n Director, Public Campus Ministries\n Michigan Conference of SDA\n \n Without this book there would be no sacred music, oratorios, beloved hymns, and Negro spirituals.\n \n The composer of the \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" George Frideric Handel, was not a religious man. Yet, even this world-famous composer was moved and inspired by words from this nonpareil book.\n \n After several years of failure in opera, Handel was plunged into poverty and despair. At the age of sixty he was bitter, depressed, and defeated. When asked to write the music for a sacred oratorio, he glanced through the pages of the manuscript with little enthusiasm for the task. But something happened when his eyes suddenly caught the words, \"Comfort ye, comfort ye My people . . . For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given . . . He shall lead His flock like a shepherd . . . Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden.\"\n \n The April 1948 Reader's Digest reports that as Handel kept reading, the text began to quicken his pulses, warm his heart, and inspire wonderful melodies. The glorious words, \"He shall reign forever and ever . . . King of kings, and Lord of lords . . . Hallelujah! Hallelujah!\" fired his creative genius.\n \n Grasping a pen, Handel jotted down in feverish haste the wonderful notes that raced through his mind. For twenty-four days and nights he worked tirelessly, as if transported to another world, paying little attention to the meals that were brought to him and hardly stopping to rest. His faithful servant became greatly worried; he had never known the master to act like this. Indeed, he appeared to be mad-writing, writing, writing, then striding about the room with tears coursing down his cheeks, singing \"Hallelujah\" at the top of his voice.\n \n Messiah, the greatest oratorio ever written, was born of an experience induced by the power of a book. Handel said of the occasion, \"I did think I did see all Heaven before me, and the great God Himself.\" No wonder King George II was so moved when the oratorio was first presented in London that he rose spontaneously to his feet at the beginning of the \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" and all of the throng with him! No wonder audiences still rise today every time the \"Hallelujah Chorus\" is sung.\n \n A Nameless Book. But what is this book that inspired Handel's \"Hallelujah Chorus\"? What is this book that has power to warm hearts, inspire hope, and transport even non-religious people to behold God in His majesty?\n \n Strangely, this nonpareil book is also nameless! It is simply called the book. \n \n Though many know the book by the title \"the Bible,\" the word is derived through Latin from the Greek to biblion, which means \"the book.\" Since the Bible is the supreme book in all the world, it does not need a name; it is enough to simply say, \"The Book\"-i.e., \"The Bible.\"\n \n A Respected Book. Indeed, many of the world's most renowned people have testified to the value and inestimable importance of the Bible.\n \n Sir Isaac Newton, one of the greatest scientists of all time, once said: \"We account the Scriptures of God to be the most sublime philosophy. I find more sure marks of authenticity in the Bible than in any profane history whatsoever\"\n \n George Washington Carver, the African-American genius of Tuskegee Institute, has been called the world's greatest biochemist. He is best known for his discovery of hundreds of valuable uses for the peanut and sweet potato. In 1921 Dr. Carver was invited to testify before the United States Senate Ways and Means Committee\n on the possibilities of the peanut. Though initially given ten minutes to speak, he so captivated the committee that the chairman said, \"Go ahead, Brother. Your time is unlimited.\" Carver spoke for one hour and forty-five minutes.\n \n At the conclusion of his presentation the chairman asked, \"Dr. Carver, how did you learn all of these things?\"\n \n Carver replied, \"From an old Book.\" \n \n \"What book?\" the Senator queried.\n \n The famed scientist replied, \"The Bible.\"\n \n \"Does the Bible tell about peanuts?\" the surprised Senator inquired.\n \n \"No, Sir,\" Dr. Carver replied, \"but it tells about the God Who made the peanut. I asked Him to show me what to do with the peanut, and He did.\"\n \n Thomas Jefferson also speaks about this Book: \"I have said and always will say that the studious perusal of the Sacred Volume will make better citizens, better fathers, and better husbands. . . . The Bible makes the best people in the world.\"\n \n Similarly, Daniel Webster, a foremost American statesman, author, lexicographer, and orator testifies: \"I believe the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be the will and Word of God.\"\n \n A Timeless Book. Unlike other books that come and go because their ideas no longer fit the thoughts of different ages or meet the needs of human hearts, the Bible is a timeless Book.\n \n One-time professor of English at Princeton University, author and diplomat Henry Van ####, has accurately remarked:\n \n Born in the East and clothed in Oriental form and imagery, the Bible walks the ways of all the world with familiar feet and enters land after land to find its own everywhere. It has learned to speak in hundreds of languages to the heart of man. It comes into the palace to tell the monarch that he is a servant of the Most High, and into the cottage to assure the peasant that he is a son of God. Children listen to its stories with wonder and delight, and the wise men ponder them as parables of life. It has a word of peace for the time of peril, and word of comfort for the day of calamity, a word of light for the hour of darkness. Its oracles are repeated in the assembly of the people, and its counsels whispered in the ear of the lonely. The wicked and the proud tremble at its warning, but to the wounded and the penitent it has a mother's voice. The wilderness and the solitary place have been made glad by it, and the fire on the hearth has lit the reading of its well-worn page. It has woven itself into our deepest affections and colored our dearest dreams; so that love and friendship, sympathy and devotion, memory and hope, put on the beautiful garments of its treasured speech, breathing frankincense and myrrh. . .\n No man is poor or desolate who has this treasure for his own. When the landscape darkens and the trembling pilgrim comes to the valley named \"of the shadow,\" he is not afraid to enter: he takes the rod and staff of Scripture in his hand; he says to friend and comrade, \"Good-by; we shall meet again;\" and comforted by that support, he goes toward the lonely pass as one who walks through darkness into light.\n Truly, this Book is like no other book.\n \n A Unique Book. The Bible was written by some 40 different authors on three different continents (Africa, Asia, and Europe), in countries hundreds of miles apart, over a period of about 1,500 years. It deals with matters of universal interest: history, philosophy, science, health, architecture, religion, prophecies, etc. It speaks to\n the needs of every generation, offers solutions to life's perplexities, and even reveals the origin and future of our world. It has brought peace to troubled consciences, comfort to the sorrowful, hope to the despairing, courage to the despondent, and the assurance of reunion to the bereaved.\n \n Originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, the Bible has been published in more languages than any other book in history, and yet it has not lost its original emphasis.\n \n This unique Book appeals to the young as well as the old, rich as well as poor, simple as well as wise. It advocates the rights of every individual, including the cause of the poor and defenseless, and it demonstrates a mysterious power to transform lives.\n \n A careful reading of this unique Book reveals that it was written by men from every level of political and social life-from the king upon his throne down to the herdsmen, shepherds, fishermen, and petty politicians.\n \n One-time President of the Southern Baptist Convention, W.A. Criswell, has written this about the Bible: \"Here are words written by princes, by poets, by philosophers, by fishermen, by statesmen, by prophets, by priests, by publicans, by physicians, by men learned in the wisdom of Egypt, by men educated in the school of Babylon, by men trained at the feet of rabbis like Gamaliel. Men of every grade and class are represented in this miraculous Volume. The circumstances under which the Book was written were sometimes most difficult and\n always most varying. Parts of it were written in tents, deserts, cities, palaces, and dungeons. Some of it was written in times of imminent danger and other parts in times of ecstatic joy.\"\n \n But the remarkable thing about the Bible is that, despite the circumstances that gave birth to the 66 different books comprising this Book, the contents of the Bible show a unique harmony. Observes H.L. Hastings: \"It contains all kinds of writing; but what a jumble it would be if sixty-six books were written in this way by ordinary men. Suppose, for instance, that we get sixty-six medical books written by thirty or forty different doctors of various schools, . . . bind them all together, and then undertake to doctor a man according to that book! . . . Or suppose you get thirty-five ministers writing books on theology, and then see if you can find any leather strong enough to hold the books together.\"\n \n A Well-preserved Book. But there is more: the Bible has been preserved remarkably during the process of transmission. Despite the fact that it was written on perishable material and was copied and recopied for hundreds of years before the invention of the printing press or computers, the Bible's two sections-the Old and New Testaments-when compared to all other ancient manuscripts, have displayed an unusual correctness in transmission.\n \n With reference to the Old Testament, the section of the Bible written in Hebrew and Aramaic, the remarkable accuracy with which the scribes wrote down the text is due to strict rules that they followed. For example, no word or letter could be written from memory. The words or letters of each section were counted, and if these did not tally with the newly made copies, the new copy was discarded altogether and the task begun again. Who ever counted the letters and syllables and words of Plato or Aristotle? Cicero or Seneca?\n \n On the other hand, the New Testament was written in Koine Greek-the common language of people in apostolic times. Though there are no original copies of the earliest writings of the apostles, we have the later\n handwritten copies that have survived. These are called manuscripts-from the Latin words manu scriptum, meaning \"written by hand.\"\n \n Generally speaking, the New Testament manuscripts are much more recent to us than the Old Testament. But unlike the well trained Old Testament copyists who were extremely careful in copying every word of the ancient documents, factors such as the great demand for copies of the New Testament to instruct new believers and the frequent interruptions in the copying process due to hostilities and persecutions led to hasty and sometimes careless copying of the original New Testament manuscripts. Fortunately for us, because of the many New Testament manuscripts that have been preserved, we can always cross-check any section whenever there is any doubt.\n \n Because of the unique preservation of the original text of the Bible, Christians can be absolutely certain of its essential accuracy. The late Sir Frederic Kenyon, one-time director of the British Museum and an authority on Bible manuscripts put it this way: \"The Christian can take the whole Bible in his hand and say without fear or hesitation that he holds in it the true Word of God, handed down without essential loss from generation to generation throughout the centuries.\"\n \n An Enduring Book. Still, of all the books ever produced, the Bible has suffered the most vicious attack. Yet it has survived the persecution of critics and enemies. It is like an anvil that has worn out the hammers of criticism. The hammers of the agnostics, atheists, and higher critics have been pecking away at this book for ages, but the hammers are worn out, and the anvil still endures. If the Book had not been the Book of God, human beings would have destroyed it long ago. Emperors and popes, kings and priests, princes and rulers, Communists and revolutionaries have all tried their hand at it; they die and the book still lives.\n \n The Book has come down to us floating upon a sea of blood-every page stained with the blood of martyrs.\n \n Bernard Ramm, a Christian scientist and theologian once asked rhetorically whether, beside the Bible, there has ever been a book on philosophy, religion, psychology, or any other subject that has been so \"chopped, knifed, sifted, scrutinized, and vilified . . . with such venom and skepticism? with such thoroughness and erudition? upon every chapter, line, and tenet?\" He concluded: \"A thousand times over, the death knell of the Bible has been sounded, the funeral procession formed, the inscription cut on the tombstone, and the committal read. But somehow the corpse never stays put. . . . Considering the thorough learning of the critics and the ferocity and precision of the attacks, we would expect the Bible to have been permanently entombed in some Christian genizah [a storage room for worn-out Scripture manuscripts]. But such is hardly the case. The Bible is still\n loved by millions, read by millions, and studied by millions.\"\n \n Jesus said it best almost 2,000 years ago: \"Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away\" (Matthew 24:35).\n \n How do we account for the remarkable power, universal appeal, unity, and survival of this ancient Book?\n \n A Revealed Book. Though written by human penmen, the Bible makes a bold claim to its divine origin. The apostle Paul wrote: \"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God\" (2 Timothy 3:16). The word \"inspiration\"\n [theopneustos in the Greek], literally means \"God-breathed,\" that is to say, all the books of the Bible have a divine origin.\n \n Charles Wesley, one of the founders of Methodism, argued that \"the Bible must be the invention of either good men or angels, bad men or devils, or of God.\" He reasons:\n It could not be the invention of good men or angels, for they neither would nor could make a book, and tell lies all the time they were writing it, saying, \"Thus saith the Lord,\" when it was their own invention.\n It could not be the invention of bad men or devils, for they would not make a book which commands all duty, forbids all sin, and condemns their souls to Hell to all eternity.\n Therefore, I draw this conclusion, that the Bible must be given by divine inspiration.\n In other words, the Bible is not simply an inspiring book by some good human writers; it is an inspired Book from God.\n \n An Inspired Book. Probably the most mysterious thing about the Bible is the manner in which God, the principal Author of the Book, was able to employ fallible human beings as His instruments to write down His message in a trustworthy manner. The unique cooperation between God and the Bible's human writers is known technically as \"inspiration.\"\n \n The apostle Peter describes it this way: \"Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost\" (2 Peter 1:21). The Greek word used here, phero, means \"to bear\" or \"to carry along.\" It was a term used by sailors for a sailing ship being carried along by the wind. As Peter was himself a fisherman, his use of this word is significant. It implies that the human writers of the Bible were gently led by the Spirit in communicating the message that God had given them by revelation. Because the Bible is the product of this cooperative effort between the human and the Divine, its message is \"sure.\" The apostle Peter again asserts:\n \n For we did not follow cleverly devised myths [Greek, mythos, a story, whatever its significance, that has no factual basis] when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty. . . . And we have the prophetic Word made more sure [Greek, bebaioteron, which has the force of \"standing firm on the feet,\" \"steadfast,\" \"reliable,\" \"valid\"]. You will do well to pay attention to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the Morning Star rises in your hearts. (2 Peter 1:16-19, RSV)\n In his letter to the Christians of Thessalonica, the apostle Paul summed up: \"And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers\" (1 Thessalonians 2:13).\n \n In other words, the fact that the Scriptures are inspired implies that the Bible is truly the Word of God.\n \n A Trustworthy Book. One unmistakable piece of evidence that the Bible has a divine imprint is the impartial manner in which its human writers recorded biographical accounts of its heroes and heroines.\n \n Noah, the survivor of the Flood, got drunk and exposed his nakedness; Abraham, the friend of God, lied and doubted God; Lot, the hero of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, got drunk and had an incestuous relationship with his daughters; Miriam, the beautiful singer and prophetess of Israel, had a racial and jealousy problem and\n was struck with leprosy; Rahab, the woman of faith and the ancestor of Jesus Christ, was a prostitute; David, a man after God's Own heart, was guilty of adultery and murder; Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived, lived the life of a fool; Judas, one of the most influential among the twelve disciples of Christ, was a thief and a traitor; Peter, a leading apostle of Christ, denied his Master with curses and swearing; John, the apostle of love, called for fire to destroy his enemies; and Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, persecuted the followers of Christ.\n \n If the biographical accounts in the Scriptures were simply human efforts to enhance the moral standing of some prominent men and women, the writers would have covered up, judiciously omitted, or reconstructed the negative and embarrassing aspects of those lives.\n \n This is the way men write history; but when the Lord undertakes to tell His story of a sinful man, He does not select a poor, miserable beggar, and show him up; He does not give even the name of the thief on the cross, nor of the guilty woman to whom He said, \"Neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more\"; but He takes King David from the throne, and sets him down in sackcloth and ashes, and wrings from his heart the cry, \"Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Thy loving-kindness: according unto the multitude of Thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.\" And then when he is pardoned, forgiven, cleansed, and made whiter than snow, the pen of inspiration writes down the whole dark, damning record of his crimes, and the king on his throne has not power, nor wealth, nor influence enough to blot the page. . . .\n And a book which tells the faults of those who wrote it, and which tells you that \"there is none righteous, no, not one,\" bears in it the marks of a true book; for we all know that men have faults, and failings, and sins; and among all the men whose lives are recorded in that book, each man has some defect, some blot, except one, and that is \"the Man Christ Jesus\" (H.L. Hastings, Will the Old Book Stand? \n [Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald, 1923, pp. 17, 18]).\n A Spiritual Book. Robert H. Pierson, one-time president of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, wrote: \"The Bible is more than a good or true book. . . . Man may write a good book, a true book, even a wonderful book, but man has never produced a volume that compares with the Holy Scriptures. The Bible lives! Through its sacred pages God moves and speaks to human hearts. It is a Book of divine origin destined from the beginning to fill a unique need among the human family. No other volume has successfully challenged it.\"\n \n This living Book points out to sinners a way of pardon, of peace, and of redemption. It tells us how human beings subject to like passions as we are, may yet be men of mighty faith, having fellowship with God, and prevailing in effectual and fervent prayer. It tells us how we who have sinned against the Most High may be cleansed from bloodguiltiness, washed and made whiter than snow, and find life and peace in Christ the Lord. It tells us how we, redeemed through God's mercy, may stand stainless as angels in the presence of the eternal King.\n \n A Neglected Book. Though there are unmistakable evidences of the Book's power to transform lives, though it remains the world's bestselling book, and though copies of it can be found in many homes, hotel rooms, and libraries, the surprising thing is that the Bible is the most neglected book!\n \n The famous English preacher George Whitefield said, \"God has condescended to become an author, and yet people will not read His writings. There are very few that ever gave this Book of God, the grand charter of salvation, one fair reading through.\"\n \n One of the most acclaimed Christian writers, Ellen G. White, wrote: \"If we will let it speak to us, the Bible will teach us what nothing else can teach. But alas! everything else is dwelt upon except the Word of God. Worthless literature, fictitious stories, are greedily devoured, while the Bible, with all its treasures of sacred truth, lies neglected upon our tables. The Sacred Word, if made the rule of life, will refine, elevate, and sanctify. It is the voice of God to man. Will we heed it?\" (Messages to Young People, p. 257).\n \n A Life-changing Book. H.L. Hastings has perceptibly observed:\n \n There are men who study philosophy, astronomy, geology, geography, and mathematics; but did you ever hear a man say, \"I was an outcast, a wretched inebriate, a disgrace to my race, and a nuisance in the world, until I began to study mathematics, and learned the multiplication table, and then turned my attention to geology, got me a little hammer, and knocked off the corners of the rocks and then studied the formation of the earth, and since that time I have been happy as the day is long; I feel like singing all the time; my soul is full of triumph and peace; and health and blessing have come to my desolate home once more\"? Did you ever hear a man ascribe his redemption and salvation from intemperance and sin and vice to the multiplication table, or the science of mathematics or geology?\n But I can bring you, not one man, or two, or ten, but men by the thousand who will tell you, \"I was wretched; I was lost; I broke my poor old mother's heart; I beggared my family; my wife was heart-stricken and dejected; my children fled from the sound of their father's footsteps; I was ruined, reckless, helpless, homeless, hopeless, until I heard the words of that Book\"!\n And he will tell you the very word which fastened on his soul. Maybe it was, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavyladen, and I will give you rest\"; perhaps it was, \"Behold the Lamb of God Which taketh away the sin of the world\"; it may have been, \"God so loved the world, that He gave His Only-Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" He can tell you the very word that saved his soul. And since that word entered his heart, he will tell you that hope has dawned upon his vision, that joy has inspired his heart, and that his mouth is filled with grateful song. He will tell you that the blush of health has come back to his poor wife's faded cheek; that the old hats have vanished from the windows of his desolate home; that his rags have been exchanged for good clothes; that his children run to meet him when he comes; that there is bread on his table, fire on his hearth, and comfort in his dwelling. He will tell you all that, and he will tell you that this Book has wrought the change.\n Yes, there is power in the Book, a power that can change your life and your circumstances. Its power rests on the fact that \"all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works\" (2 Timothy 3:16, 17).\n \n A Book Like No Other. When was the last time you read the Book? How much time do you spend daily with the Bible? Don't you think it is about time to begin reading God's inspired Word\"-the Book that is like no other book?\n \n On July 28, 1917, Woodrow Wilson wrote these pertinent words:\n \n The Bible is the Word of life. I beg that you will read it and find this out for yourselves-read, not little snatches here and there, but long passages that will really be the road to the heart of it. You will find it not only full of real men and women, but also of the things you have wondered about and been troubled about all your life, as men have been always; and the more you read, the more will it become plain to you the things that are worthwhile and what are not, what things make men happy-loyalty, right dealing, speaking the truth, readiness to give everything for what they think their duty, and, most of all, the wish that they may have the approval of the Christ, Who gave everything for them-and the things that are guaranteed to make men unhappy-selfishness, cowardice, greed, and everything that is low and mean.\n When you have read the Bible you will know that it is the Word of God, because you will have found it the key to your own heart, your own happiness, and your own duty.\n The promise God gave to Joshua can be ours if we heed His counsel: \"This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success\" (Joshua 1:8).\n \n This promised blessing will bring peace to our troubled consciences, comfort to our broken hearts, light to our perplexed minds, and strength to our discouraged souls.The Bible: A Book Like No Other",

In \n addition, Thallus was born in 50 c.e... and Africanus was dismissing Thallus claim it was only an eclipse. Thus, to claim this is evidence of a 'historical Jesus' is just plain nuts. \n \n \n\n Pliny the Younger, in Letters 10:96, recorded early Christian worship practices including the fact that Christians worshiped Jesus as God and were very ethical, and includes a reference to the love feast and Lord&#8217;s Supper.\n \n\n \n The letters of Pliny are evidence that Christian existed. I notice you didn't bother to actually quote what Pliny said... probably because it doesn't meet your expectations.\n \n \n\n The Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin 43a) confirms Jesus' crucifixion on the eve of Passover and the accusations against Christ of practicing sorcery and encouraging Jewish apostasy.\n \n\n \n The Babylonian Talmud was written 150 years after the alleged event, and is\n as follows\n \n \n There is a tradition (in a Barraitha): They hanged Yeshu on the Sabbath of the Passover[1]. But for forty days before that a herald went in front of him (crying), \"Yeshu is to be stoned because he practiced sorcery and seduced Israel and lead them away from God[2]. Anyone who can provide evidence on his behalf should come forward to defend him.\" \n \n \n Now, using this as 'evidence' of a historical Jesus has the following problems\n \n 1) It is late enough that polemetrics between the Jewish faith and the new Christian faith developed\n 2) It says 'there is a tradition' that it happened\n 3) The phrase 'Being hung' was not crucifixion, but rather asphyxiation followed by the hanging of the body for display. \n 4) Jesus was a very common name, so except for the fact there is an execution on the eve of passover, there is no correlation. \n \n\n Lucian of Samosata was a second-century Greek writer who admits that Jesus was worshiped by Christians, introduced new teachings, and was crucified for them. He said that Jesus' teachings included the brotherhood of believers, the importance of conversion, and the importance of denying other gods. Christians lived according to Jesus&#8217; laws, believed themselves to be immortal, and were characterized by contempt for death, voluntary self-devotion, and renunciation of material goods.\n \n\n Yes, he was born 125 C.E, and no one has denied that Christians existed in the 2nd Century C.E. and that they worshipped a god man they thought were exectued. That is merely recording the beliefs of the Christians, not if there was a historical Jesus. \n \n \n\n Mara Bar-Serapion confirms that Jesus was thought to be a wise and virtuous man, was considered by many to be the king of Israel, was put to death by the Jews, and lived on in the teachings of his followers.\n \n\n This is the letter of Mara Bar-Serapion\n \n What advantage did the Athenians gain from putting Socrates to death? Famine and plague came upon them as a judgment for their crime. What advantage did the men of Samos gain from burning Pythagoras? In a moment their land was covered with sand. What advantage did the Jews gain from executing their wise king? It was just after that that their kingdom was abolished. God justly avenged these three wise men: the Athenians died of hunger; the Samians were overwhelmed by the sea; the Jews, ruined and driven from their land, live in complete dispersion. But Socrates did not die for good; he lived on in the teaching of Plato. Pythagoras did not die for good; he lived on in the statue of Hera. Nor did the wise king die for good; he lived on in the teaching which he had given\n \n \n Where does it mention Jesus as all? It is a mere assumption that the 'wise king' is Jesus, and it probably is not, since Jesus was not a king.\n In addition, the date range which he could have been writing is between 73 C.E. and the third century, so it is hard to see where he got his information from.. If it was the late second century, it probably was from Christians.\n \n \n \n\n \n Then we have all the Gnostic writings (The Gospel of Truth, The Apocryphon of John, The Gospel of Thomas, The Treatise on Resurrection, etc.) that all mention Jesus.\n \n\n \n Yep, religious references, each and every one.

I notice you didn't bother to actually quote what Pliny said... probably because it doesn't meet your expectations.\n \n Pliny The Younger:\n \n Context:\n \n Pliny the Younger was Governor of Bithynia. His correspondence in 106 A.D. with the emperor Trajan included a report on proceedings against Christians. In an extended explanation to his supervisor, Pliny explained that he had been killing both men and women, boys and girls. There were so many being put to death that he wondered if he should continue killing anyone who was discovered to be a Christian, or if he should kill only certain ones. He goes on to say that he also forced them to \"curse Christ, which a genuine Christian cannot be induced to do.\" [5 p. 83] He also described their actions and practices as follows: \n \n \"They asserted, however, that the sum and substance of their fault or error had been that they were accustomed to meet on a fixed day before dawn and sing responsively a hymn to Christ as to a god, and to bind themselves by oath, not to some crime, but not to commit fraud, theft, or adultery, not falsify their trust, nor to refuse to return a trust when called upon to do so. When this was over, it was their custom to depart and to assemble again to partake of food--but ordinary and innocent food. Even this, they affirmed, they had ceased to do after my edict by which, in accordance with your instructions, I had forbidden political associations. Accordingly, I judged it all the more necessary to find out what the truth was by torturing two female slaves who were called deaconesses. But I discovered nothing else but depraved, excessive superstition.\" \n \n \n \n \n You don't have Christiaity without Christ, and this was Christ's era. Very foolish mover on your behalf... remember that shhhhhhhhhhh advice? Use, make love to it... shower with it, ingest it... just shut your ignorant trap.\n \n \n \n On to more punishiment:\n \n Cornelius Tacitus\n \n Context:\n \n Tacitus was a Roman historian writing early in the second century AD (112 AD). His Annals provide us with a single reference to Jesus of considerable value. The following is a full quote of the relevant cite, from Annals 15.44. Jesus and the Christians are mentioned in an account of how the Emperor Nero went after Christians in order to draw attention away from himself after Rome's fire of 64 AD:\n \n \n \"But not all the relief that could come from man, not all the bounties that the prince could bestow, nor all the atonements which could be presented to the gods, availed to relieve Nero from the infamy of being believed to have ordered the conflagration, the fire of Rome. Hence to suppress the rumor, he falsely charged with the guilt, and punished Christians, who were hated for their enormities. Christus, the founder of the name, was put to death by Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judea in the reign of Tiberius: but the pernicious superstition, repressed for a time broke out again, not only through Judea, where the mischief originated, but through the city of Rome also, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their center and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind.\"\n \n \n Thallus:\n \n Context:\n \n He is one of the first Gentile writers who mentions Christ. In 52 A.D. he wrote attempting to give a natural explanation for the darkness which occurred at the crucifixion of Jesus. However, his writings have disappeared and we only know of them from fragments cited by other writers. One such writer is Julius Africanus, a Christian writer about 221 A.D. [5 p. 84] One very interesting passage relates to a comment from Thallus. Julius Africanus writes:\n \n \" 'Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me' (unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of the full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died).\"\n \n \n Setonius\n \n Context:\n \n Suetonius was a court official and annalist under Hadrian, 120 A.D. [5 p. 83] He wrote the following: \n \n \"As the Jews were making constant disturbance at the instigation of Chrestus[Christ], he expelled them from Rome\". [5 p.83] \n \n \n Josephus Flavius\n \n Context:\n \n \"Josephus (born AD 37) was a Jewish historian. He became a Pharisee at the age 19 and in A.D. 66 he was the commander of Jewish forces in Galilee. After being captured, he was attached to the Roman headquarters. [5 p. 82] In Josephus' antiquities, there are two quotes that mention Jesus. Here is the first and smaller quote: \n \n \n \"Antiquities 20.9.1 But the younger Ananus who, as we said, received the high priesthood, was of a bold disposition and exceptionally daring; he followed the party of the Sadducees, who are severe in judgment above all the Jews, as we have already shown. As therefore Ananus was of such a disposition, he thought he had now a good opportunity, as Festus was now dead, and Albinus was still on the road; so he assembled a council of judges, and brought before it the brother of Jesus the so-called Christ, whose name was James, together with some others, and having accused them as law-breakers, he delivered them over to be stoned.\"\n \n \n More Josephus\n \n \n Context:\n \n Here is the second Josephus reference, the Testimonium Flavianum, as it is popularly called. The authenticity of the passage was first questioned in the 16th century; one of its most significant detractors was the French sceptic Voltaire, so if you here scoffing - understand it is secularists by-in-large. The passage reads: \n \n \"Antiquities 18.3.3 Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was the Christ, and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men among us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared to them alive again the third day; as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians so named from him are not extinct at this day.\"\n \n \n If that is all your rinsed off parsing nets you... reading anything does you no good. Pliny, Setonius and Josephus wrote on events concerning Christ's life. In all honesty... you cannot revise history to suit your bent, and ignoring what people spoke freely on and deciding what to accept and ignore doesn't help you either - mainly because you weren't;t part of the reality then. You're just trying to rinse off what you can handle of what actually happened; this is the signature trait of a hard-line secularist, which is no point at all nor makes any sense. \n \n \n \n \"Yes, he was born 125 C.E, and no one has denied that Christians existed in the 2nd Century C.E. and that they worshipped a god man they thought were exectued.\"\n \n That's a lie... and not even rational. If you deny the cause - how do you logically subsitatiate the effect? You admit Christians exist but deny Christ existed. That is what we call a reprobate intellect... completely! unstable in all its ways... Look, Christians bear Christ's Namesake... all upon a ministry they didn't create nor could have. So which is it Trebor... Christ never existed - or Christians somehow do? Your language is licentiously dismissive... for no reason. What you meant is, the people who watched Christ crucified... and then reported it - this would include secularists too like the average Roman citizen. This is what you cannot get past... there is no \"thought\" - they saw, you \"think\" but ignore.\n \n \n \n \"That is merely recording the beliefs of the Christians, not if there was a historical Jesus.\"\n \n \n Feelings aren't facts Trebor... just because you don;t like it doesn't means it isn't real. Christ's crucifixion was a matter of public record - you can't dodge that, neither did the secular historians who commented on matters surrounding this historic fact.\n \n \n \n Lastly... outside of your loose references to Mara Bar-Serpaion, which no credible apologist would use, you have completely failed to discredit the technology of the day to record the events of the day... i.e. ink and scrolls and Christ's crucifixion. Like I said before, sorry they didn't tape recorders... but you'd have even less excuse then. But give a fool an inch... and they'll try to take a year off your life. Sorry Trebor - you have not made any convincing arguments to deny that Christ didn't exist not one, but let a secularist have and opportunity to revise history - now that I wouldn't put past you, or any mind like yours.\n \n \n Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh.... for you silence should be like money. The quieter you are their richer you look.\n \n -That Darn Republican",

He goes on to say that he also forced them to \"curse Christ, which a genuine Christian cannot be induced to do.\" [5 p. 83] He also described their actions and practices as follows: \n \n \"They asserted, however, that the sum and substance of their fault or error had been that they were accustomed to meet on a fixed day before dawn and sing responsively a hymn to Christ as to a god, and to bind themselves by oath, not to some crime, but not to commit fraud, theft, or adultery, not falsify their trust, nor to refuse to return a trust when called upon to do so. When this was over, it was their custom to depart and to assemble again to partake of food--but ordinary and innocent food. Even this, they affirmed, they had ceased to do after my edict by which, in accordance with your instructions, I had forbidden political associations. Accordingly, I judged it all the more necessary to find out what the truth was by torturing two female slaves who were called deaconesses. But I discovered nothing else but depraved, excessive superstition.\" \n \n\n \n Let me repeat things for you\n Accordingly, I judged it all the more necessary to find out what the truth was by torturing two female slaves who were called deaconesses. But I discovered nothing else but depraved, excessive superstition.\" \n \n \n\n \n \n You don't have Christiaity without Christ, and this was Christ's era. Very foolish mover on your behalf... remember that shhhhhhhhhhh advice? Use, make love to it... shower with it, ingest it... just shut your ignorant trap.\n \n\n \n Well, it shows that there is no evidence of a historical basis in reality. But.. \n Hey, you can keep on bringing up your best evidence and showing that Christianity is based on smoke and mirrors all you want.\n \n \n\n \n On to more punishiment:\n \n Cornelius Tacitus\n \n Context:\n \n Tacitus was a Roman historian writing early in the second century AD (112 AD). His Annals provide us with a single reference to Jesus of considerable value. The following is a full quote of the relevant cite, from Annals 15.44. Jesus and the Christians are mentioned in an account of how the Emperor Nero went after Christians in order to draw attention away from himself after Rome's fire of 64 AD:\n \n \n \"But not all the relief that could come from man, not all the bounties that the prince could bestow, nor all the atonements which could be presented to the gods, availed to relieve Nero from the infamy of being believed to have ordered the conflagration, the fire of Rome. Hence to suppress the rumor, he falsely charged with the guilt, and punished Christians, who were hated for their enormities. Christus, the founder of the name, was put to death by Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judea in the reign of Tiberius: but the pernicious superstition, repressed for a time broke out again, not only through Judea, where the mischief originated, but through the city of Rome also, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their center and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind.\"\n \n\n \n Ah yes.. information that he got for Christians.. and , which by the way is not supported by any other sources. That passage was 'discovered' in a\n Christian monastery in the 16th century. Not only that , Tacitus does not use the name JESUS, but rather uses a term that was given to Jesus by Christians after his death. This shows that Tacitus got his information from\n Christians. Getting information about Christian beliefs from Christians is not evidence of a historical Jesus.\n \n \n\n \n Thallus:\n \n Context:\n \n He is one of the first Gentile writers who mentions Christ. In 52 A.D. he wrote attempting to give a natural explanation for the darkness which occurred at the crucifixion of Jesus. However, his writings have disappeared and we only know of them from fragments cited by other writers. One such writer is Julius Africanus, a Christian writer about 221 A.D. [5 p. 84] One very interesting passage relates to a comment from Thallus. Julius Africanus writes:\n \n \" 'Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me' (unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of the full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died).\"\n \n\n \n Let's see, that is what Julius Africanus said about Thallus. Thallus was born 20 years after this event was supposed to have happened, and we do not have any of the history. He was obviously responding to the Gospel of Matthew, if he was discussing Jesus at all. So, do you have the document that J.A. was trying to counter? No, you don't. you just have a biased second hand account.. and the original was written well after the alleged events.. Not evidence at all, except in your wildest fantasies.\n \n \n\n Setonius\n \n Context:\n \n Suetonius was a court official and annalist under Hadrian, 120 A.D. [5 p. 83] He wrote the following: \n \n \"As the Jews were making constant disturbance at the instigation of Chrestus[Christ], he expelled them from Rome\". [5 p.83] \n \n\n \n The problem with using this as 'evidence of a historical Jesus'. The term 'Chrestus' is not \"Jesus\", and it is someone that appears to be in Rome, which Jesus never was. Chrestus is a common name\n \n \n \n\n \n Josephus Flavius\n \n Context:\n \n \"Josephus (born AD 37) was a Jewish historian. He became a Pharisee at the age 19 and in A.D. 66 he was the commander of Jewish forces in Galilee. After being captured, he was attached to the Roman headquarters. [5 p. 82] In Josephus' antiquities, there are two quotes that mention Jesus. Here is the first and smaller quote: \n \n \n \"Antiquities 20.9.1 But the younger Ananus who, as we said, received the high priesthood, was of a bold disposition and exceptionally daring; he followed the party of the Sadducees, who are severe in judgment above all the Jews, as we have already shown. As therefore Ananus was of such a disposition, he thought he had now a good opportunity, as Festus was now dead, and Albinus was still on the road; so he assembled a council of judges, and brought before it the brother of Jesus the so-called Christ, whose name was James, together with some others, and having accused them as law-breakers, he delivered them over to be stoned.\"\n \n\n \n And, if you knew squat about the Jewish law and tradition, hyou would know that 'Christ' is the greek version of the Hebrew 'Moishe' , which is translated as 'annointed'. During the time frame, the official 'annointed' one as the High priest, who was appointed and annointed to that position on a yearly basis.\n \n If you read further, you will see that Ananus was replaced as high priest by Jesus (but Jesus of Nazareth). This is known as 'ignoring the rest of the context of the passage'. Quote mining at it's worst. \n \n [quote]\n More Josephus\n \n \n Context:\n \n Here is the second Josephus reference, the Testimonium Flavianum, as it is popularly called. The authenticity of the passage was first questioned in the 16th century; one of its most significant detractors was the French sceptic Voltaire, so if you here scoffing - understand it is secularists by-in-large. The passage reads: \n \n \"Antiquities 18.3.3 Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was the Christ, and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men among us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared to them alive again the third day; as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians so named from him are not extinct at this day.\"\n [/quote}\n Even the most ardent conservative Biblical scholar will admit that antiquties 18 is at the very least modified in the 4th century. Now, because they have \n admitted was modified , they have to show that it is not a total forgery. \n \n I see no evidence this passage existed before the 4th century. It is a piaus forgery for the faithful. It must really hurt to have to rely on FORGERIES to prove something :\n \n [quote]\n \n If that is all your rinsed off parsing nets you... reading anything does you no good. Pliny, Setonius and Josephus wrote on events concerning Christ's life. In all honesty... you cannot revise history to suit your bent, and ignoring what people spoke freely on and deciding what to accept and ignore doesn't help you either - mainly because you weren't;t part of the reality then. You're just trying to rinse off what you can handle of what actually happened; this is the signature trait of a hard-line secularist, which is no point at all nor makes any sense. \n \n \n\n \n \"Yes, he was born 125 C.E, and no one has denied that Christians existed in the 2nd Century C.E. and that they worshipped a god man they thought were exectued.\"\n \n That's a lie... and not even rational. If you deny the cause - how do you logically subsitatiate the effect? You admit Christians exist but deny Christ existed. That is what we call a reprobate intellect... completely! unstable in all its ways... Look, Christians bear Christ's Namesake... all upon a ministry they didn't create nor could have. So which is it Trebor... Christ never existed - or Christians somehow do? Your language is licentiously dismissive... for no reason. What you meant is, the people who watched Christ crucified... and then reported it - this would include secularists too like the average Roman citizen. This is what you cannot get past... there is no \"thought\" - they saw, you \"think\" but ignore.\n \n \n \n \"That is merely recording the beliefs of the Christians, not if there was a historical Jesus.\"\n \n \n Feelings aren't facts Trebor... just because you don;t like it doesn't means it isn't real. Christ's crucifixion was a matter of public record - you can't dodge that, neither did the secular historians who commented on matters surrounding this historic fact.\n \n \n \n Lastly... outside of your loose references to Mara Bar-Serpaion, which no credible apologist would use, you have completely failed to discredit the technology of the day to record the events of the day... i.e. ink and scrolls and Christ's crucifixion. Like I said before, sorry they didn't tape recorders... but you'd have even less excuse then. But give a fool an inch... and they'll try to take a year off your life. Sorry Trebor - you have not made any convincing arguments to deny that Christ didn't exist not one, but let a secularist have and opportunity to revise history - now that I wouldn't put past you, or any mind like yours.\n \n \n Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh.... for you silence should be like money. The quieter you are their richer you look.\n \n -That Darn Republican\n\n \n Hey, if you want to think these meager late writings are evidence of a historical Jesus. you can.

   "Why do the fundies always state that which applies directly to them, and somehow think it scores them a point against the opposition?\n\n \n \"Fundies,\" he said!!\n \n Liberal Fundamentalism \n \n Someone once said to beware of zealots. Yet Jesus Christ was a zealot for the ways of God, and Mother Theresa was certainly a zealot for helping the sick and needy. Being a zealot, then, is not automatically a prescription for hated. Likewise, religious fundamentalism. One can certainly believe in the fundamental teachings of Jesus Christ and Biblical values, practice them, and not be a threat to society or one's neighbors. On the other hand, there's a new and particularly pernicious brand of fundamentalism making the rounds in America today - liberal fundamentalism. \n \n Liberal Fundamentalism is a failed and destructive philosophical enterprise, replete with a host of anti-Biblical, pseudo-religious doctrines that seeks to elevate the ways and \"wisdom\" of man above the wisdom and desires of God. Its principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are revisited through suspect liberal \"scholarship\" or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of today's liberal elitists. \n \n The genesis of today's liberal fundamentalists was the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and \"free-love,\" illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and they enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt. \n \n Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice are often foreign concepts to them. \"Right and wrong,\" and \"good and evil\" were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than if it \"feels good, let's do it.\" The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their \"progressive\" mindset was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values. They said not to trust anyone \"over 30,\" and now they're over 30 and say, \"Trust us, and what we teach!\" Thank you, FOXNews.com - University of Colorado Board Votes to Fire Embattled Professor Ward Churchill - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News Ward Churchill. \n \n One of the most revered mantras of liberal fundamentalism is \"equality.\" The net effect of this experiment, in many instances, was to elevate women via the degradation of men, promote racial equality by instituting race-based preferences and reverse discrimination, engender class warfare against people of means via their socialistic redistribution of wealth schemes (a concept centered in greed for other people's money, rather than relying on one's own personal initiative and work ethic), and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, pornography, and other ungodly issues) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. \n \n Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal \"tolerance.\" However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a contradictory, partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant. \n \n Rather than truly embrace \"freedom,\" liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses that are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUV's, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools and the workplace, embrace a de-facto litmus test against pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, try to squelch legitimate religious speech via \"hate-speech\" laws (note Canada), and generally engage in a wide range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values. \n \n Ii is certainly arguable, then, that \"progressive\" liberal fundamentalism substantially undermines the basic effectiveness of the government and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence. - Author Unknown \n \n emoticon_xbye",

And you look at the so called character of believers in Christ who oppose your lies about who God is with boldness and consider their character flawed for simply opposing you. \n \n It is true though that believers in and followers of Christ are not perfect, but we are seeking to sincerely be more like Him in our daily walk. And He is the most perfect example of living right who has ever lived. On the other hand, the people you do respect and never judge are people who have no such example or righteous teacher to follow or be more like. Here is what true christians practice in their personal lives and strive for as faithful followers of a perfect and Holy example who died so that we might live more abundant lives.\n Tts 3:1 Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work,\n Tts 3:2 to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility to all men.\n Tts 3:3 For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.\n Tts 3:4 But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared,\n Tts 3:5 not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,\n Tts 3:6 whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior,\n Tts 3:7 that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.\n Tts 3:8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, that those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.\n And these also:\n 2Sa 22:36 \"You have also given me the shield of Your salvation; Your gentleness has made me great.\n \n Isa 40:11 He will feed His flock like a shepherd; He will gather the lambs with His arm, And carry [them] in His bosom, [And] gently lead those who are with young.\n \n Mat 11:29 Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.\n \n 2Cr 10:1 Now I, Paul, myself am pleading with you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ--who in presence am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you.\n \n Gal 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,\n \n Gal 6:1 Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted.\n \n Eph 4:2 with all lowliness and gentleness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love,\n \n Phl 4:5 Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord [is] at hand.\n \n Col 3:12 Therefore, as [the] elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering;\n \n Col 3:13 bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also [must do].\n \n 1Th 2:7 But we were gentle among you, just as a nursing [mother] cherishes her own children.\n \n 2Ti 2:24 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient,\n \n 2Ti 2:25 in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth,\n \n Jam 1:19 So then,* my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;\n \n Jam 1:20 for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.\n \n Jam 3:17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.\n \n 1Pe 3:8 Finally, all [of you be] of one mind, having compassion for one another; love as brothers, [be] tenderhearted, [be] courteous;*\n These are the life principles and characteristics of Christ which we attempt to emulate and which you find so offensive in us.

However, Rome destroyed Jerusalem in 70 A.D., and no mention of that destruction is made in the Gospels (although around 30 A.D., Jesus did predict said destruction), therefore, the Gospels must have been written before 70 A.D. (within a few decades of the Crucifixion in 32 A.D.) The spread of the Gospel message was rapid in the decades after the Crucifixion, no doubt aided by these written Gospels and letters from the Apostles. And translations into other languages were early and often, with no discrepancies of facts showing amongst the various translations, also demonstrating that the Gospels were consistent and written down shortly after Christ's crucifixion.\n \n As the written Gospels were being circulated in the decades after Jesus' incarnation, it is obvious that many people who witnessed the works, words, and crucifixion of Jesus were then still alive, and indicatively, none of them objected to the accuracy of the circulating Gospels. And the Roman historians Suetonius and Tacitus confirm the historicity of Christ and the faith that He fostered, as does the Hebrew Talmud which confirms that Jesus did in fact perform miracles.\n \n The Roman historian Thallus recorded that the sun did go dark at mid-day during the time of the Crucifixion in 32 A.D., as the Bible also describes. Thallus said that the darkness was due to a solar eclipse, however, the Passover (when Christ was crucified) always occurred during full moons (when solar eclipses cannot happen). And the Bible describes three hours of mid-day darkness, whereas, solar eclipses last merely a few minutes, therefore, the pagan Thallus accurately recorded the mid-day darkening, but not the mechanism for the darkening. (The mechanism for the sky's darkening at the Crucifixion remains a mystery.)\n \n Bible skeptics say that the Apostles may have conspired to somehow fake the resurrection of Jesus, and thenceforth, deceitfully sought a following of believers who would gullibly embrace a resurrection charade. This notion is illogical, however, because the Apostles would never die for what they knew to be a lie. Eleven of the twelve Apostles suffered violent martyrdoms for their public proclamations about the resurrected Christ, why then would they send themselves to a life of persecution and eventual martyrdom for a contrivance that they could easily have disavowed?\n \n The Jewish officials who wanted the death of Jesus hadn't any motivation to fake Christ's resurrection, for that would have only confirmed the claims of the One that they wanted to dispatch, and the Roman officials also hadn't any motivation for essentially the same reasons. Were the Roman sentries assigned to guard the tomb of Jesus to blame for faked resurrection? No, the sentries faced execution should they have worked with the Apostles in a charade of defiance against Roman hegemony.\n \n The Jews were expecting the Messiah at that time, but most were expecting a military hero who would throw-off the yoke of Rome. Daniel 9 predicted that the \"Anointed One\" would be cut-off (killed) four hundred and eighty-three years after the command to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem (which was decreed by Cyrus of Persia around 450 B.C.), therefore obviously, some Jews saw that Jesus truly is the Messiah. And many Jews also realized that the circumstances of Christ's incarnation fulfilled the centuries-old prophecies about the Messiah in minute detail.\n \n The life and physical death of Jesus Christ are historically well-documented, and there aren't any logical reasons to think that any of the factions involved in the Crucifixion would have been motivated to fake the resurrection, so we can safely say that the resurrection is an historical fact because there were hundreds of eye-witnesses of Jesus' resurrected body recorded in the Gospels (and remember, these Gospels were not considered to be inaccurate by the Apostles' contemporaries in the decades after the Crucifixion).Gospel Veracity",

You cannot attack the veracity of the bible by narrowly attacking any aspect of it but must use a well rounded and time tested methodology in order to look at it from multiple avenues. The link below explains and defends the process used by objective researchers in order to confirm the historical veracity of what the NT says. If you can defeat it using this methodology then you will be onto something real. Otherwise, you are just a spoiler attempting to throw irrational and dead end wrenches into the works.\n Presenting Evidence That Demands a Verdict\n \n By: Multiple Authors (Bio)\n \n Of the four approaches profiled in this book, the classical and evidentialist approaches are the closest to each other. Indeed, many apologists, such as William Lane Craig, J. P. Moreland, and Richard Swinburne, cannot for various reasons be neatly placed into one approach rather than the other. One reason this is so is that the second &#8216;step&#8217; or stage of the classical apologetic uses many if not all of the very same arguments that are part of the evidentialist arsenal. That is, after showing that God exists, classical apologists turn to evidences showing that God has revealed himself in the Bible and incarnated himself in Jesus&#8212;and these evidences will be the same evidences that are crucial to most evidentialist apologetics. Another reason for the similarity between these two approaches is that evidentialism is by nature eclectic, and therefore evidentialists freely use classical apologetic arguments, including those used by the classical apologist to establish theism.\n \n Despite the similarities between the two approaches, there are some differences that justify recognizing them as two distinct &#8216;families&#8217; or types of apologetics. As we have already noted, the main difference is that classical apologetics builds the case for Christianity in two stages: first the evidence for God (theism), and second the evidence for Christianity. The rationale for this approach is that the miracles of Christianity can be viewed as credible only within a theistic worldview. Evidentialists, on the other hand, think the case for Christianity can be most effectively presented using evidences for creation, for the historicity of Jesus and especially his resurrection, and other evidences in one &#8216;cumulative case&#8217; for Christian theism.\n \n Scripture as Source\n \n According to John Warwick Montgomery, &#8220;The final and best evidence of God&#8217;s existence lies in his Word&#8212;in the triple sense of Christ, the gospel he proclaimed, and the Scripture that infallibly conveys it.&#8221;1 This statement nicely captures the spirit of the evangelical evidentialist apologetic. Rather than developing an apologetic for theism as preparation for considering the specific claims of Christ to reveal God to us and to reconcile us to God, the evidentialist views Christ and the Bible, in which we learn about Christ, as the best source for a Christian apologetic.\n \n The first step for evidentialists such as Montgomery, then, is to defend the biblical writings, not as infallible Scripture, but as historically credible and reliable documents. Securing belief in God is not considered a prerequisite to taking this first step; only clearing away any methodological or philosophical assumptions that prejudge the question of the truth of the biblical narratives is necessary. So, for example, in his book History and Christianity, Montgomery details &#8220;four common errors&#8221; in the anti-Christian polemic of philosopher Avrum Stroll before beginning his apologetic proper: (1) Stroll relies almost exclusively on modern &#8220;authorities&#8221; of a radically rationalistic sort (17-18).2 (2) Stroll ignores the evidence of the earliest primary documents, specifically the letters of Paul (18-19). (3) Stroll begs the question by assuming that the miraculous events reported in the Gospels could not have happened simply because they were miraculous (19-21). Note that Montgomery does not argue here that miracles are possible; he simply objects to the assumption that they are impossible. (4) Stroll engages in groundless historical speculation when he suggests that the Christian view of Jesus was the product of &#8220;messianic fever&#8221; in first-century Judaism (21-22).\n \n Having cleared away these errors, Montgomery begins his positive case with this disclaimer: &#8220;We won&#8217;t naively assume the &#8216;inspiration&#8217; or &#8216;infallibility&#8217; of the New Testament records and then by circular reasoning attempt to prove what we have previously assumed. We will regard the documents, even though today they are usually printed on fine India paper with verse numbers, only as documents, and we will treat them as we would any other historical materials&#8221; (25-26).\n \n To assure his readers he is employing an unbiased method of treating the historical reliability of the New Testament, Montgomery chooses tests of reliability drawn from a textbook on English literary history by a military historian.3 These are the bibliographical, internal, and external tests (26). Montgomery and other evidentialists use this threefold test regularly to defend the historical reliability of the New Testament.4\n \n The bibliographical test seeks to determine whether the existing or extant copies of a document are reliable reproductions of the wording of the original document. Montgomery emphasizes that we have many more manuscript copies for the New Testament writings than for other ancient writings, and that the time gap between the earliest complete copies and the originals is smaller for the New Testament than for other ancient writings (26-29). &#8220;To be skeptical of the resultant text of the New Testament books is to allow all of classical antiquity to slip into obscurity, for no documents of the ancient period are as well attested bibliographically as the New Testament&#8221; (29).\n \n The bibliographical test does not establish the factual accuracy of the historical narratives in the documents, only that the documents as we know them are substantially the same as they were when originally written. Accurate copies of fables would still be fables. But the claim is so often made that the New Testament writings are unreliable because of mistakes in the copying process that apologists find it necessary and helpful to point out the evidence for the textual reliability of the Bible.\n \n The second and third tests address the historical reliability of the contents of the biblical documents. The internal test considers the claims of the writings as to their historicity and internal consistency. Here Montgomery and other evidentialists insist &#8220;that the benefit of the doubt is to be given to the document itself, not arrogated by the critic to himself&#8221; (29). Paul&#8217;s writings claim to be written by Paul, and the Gospels, especially Luke and John, claim to be recording history based on eyewitness testimony (29-30). These claims should be accepted at face value as truthful unless and until evidence to the contrary is produced.\n \n The external test asks whether the testimony of the biblical writings is corroborated or undermined by extrabiblical sources. Here Montgomery focuses on the Gospels. Luke&#8217;s accuracy is confirmed by the archaeological and geographical investigations of William Ramsay toward the end of the nineteenth century (31-32). Second-century Christians who knew the apostles or their immediate disciples testified that the Gospels were based on eyewitness testimony. Thus Mark&#8217;s Gospel was based on Peter&#8217;s recollections; Matthew, himself an apostle, wrote his Gospel while the other apostles were still alive; Luke was written by Paul&#8217;s traveling companion; and John the apostle wrote the Gospel bearing his name (32-34).\n \n Montgomery concludes &#8220;that on the basis of the accepted canons of historical method . . . the New Testament documents must be regarded as reliable sources of information&#8221; (43). This line of argument &#8220;depends in no sense on theology. It rests solely upon historical method, the kind of method all of us have to use in analyzing historical data, whether Christians, rationalists, agnostics or Tibetan monks&#8221; (44).\n \n Besides passing tests of general historical reliability, Scripture functions in more profound ways as the source of evidence for its own truth and the truth claims of Christianity. Evidentialists marshal evidences from a number of directions to build a cumulative case for the truth of the Bible. These evidences include the miracles of the Bible, the uniqueness of the Bible, and fulfilled prophecy. Later we will consider the evidentialist approach to the miracles of the Bible; here we will highlight the argument from fulfilled prophecy.\n \n Fulfilled prophecy, while it has always had a place in apologetics,5 has a distinctive use and emphasis in evidential apologetics, especially since the nineteenth century when books like Alexander Keith&#8217;s Evidence of the Truth of the Christian Religion Derived from the Literal Fulfilment of Prophecy went through many editions.6\n \n Evidentialists note that &#8220;fulfilled prophecy was part of the means of establishing Old Testament religion.&#8221;7 John Bloom, for example, quotes the Lord&#8217;s challenge in Isaiah issued to idols and all false gods to prove themselves by predicting the future (Isaiah 44:21-23; 44:7-8), and comments: &#8220;The God of the Bible is calling for a rigorous test which involves the objective prediction of future events in human history. . . . Logically, we can reverse this challenge to other &#8216;gods&#8217; and ask if the God of the Bible can predict the future Himself. If He can, and if no other religion can substantiate a similar claim, then we have an objective, historically testable verification that the God of the Bible alone exists.&#8221;8\n \n Bloom identifies four criteria that need to be satisfied in order to conclude that a genuine prophecy has been given. (1) It must be clear. (2) We must know that it was given before the event. (3) It cannot be fulfilled by the actions of the human person making the prediction. And (4) its content must be unusually specific or long range so as to make its fulfillment remarkable. Bloom then implicitly adds a fifth, namely, that the successful prediction must not be accompanied by a number of false predictions. Thus Jeane Dixon might be given some credit for predicting John F. Kennedy&#8217;s assassination but for the fact that so many of her other predictions have failed.9 Anyone making dozens of unlikely predictions year after year is bound to get a few of them right!\n \n Evidentialists point to three clusters of fulfilled prophecies as evidence for the divine inspiration and truth of the Bible. First, the Old Testament contains numerous prophecies concerning the rise and fall of various nations and cities surrounding Israel, such as Egypt, Tyre and Sidon, Babylon, and Nineveh. There is some dispute about the details of the Tyre prophecy in Ezekiel 26, but evidentialists are confident that the chapter, properly interpreted, was dramatically and literally fulfilled.10\n \n Second, evidentialists cite the existence and history of Israel as an amazing fulfillment of biblical prophecy.11 Robert Newman tells the story of the skeptical Frederick the Great, who asked his court chaplain for a good argument for God, to which the chaplain replied, &#8220;The Jew, your majesty!&#8221;12 The Bible predicts that the Jews would fall into idolatry and be chastised, yet would later be returned to the land. Evidentialists point out that nations have repeatedly tried to annihilate the Jewish culture and people and yet have failed; they see this as evidence of God&#8217;s remarkable providential care for the Jewish people.13\n \n Third, evidentialists are especially impressed by the fulfilled prophecies in the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus. The Gospels, especially Matthew, strongly emphasize the idea that Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. Evidentialists are aware of the common criticism that the Gospel writers take the Old Testament texts out of context, but they reply that this criticism is without merit. Newman points out various paradoxical features of Old Testament messianic prophecies that find their natural and obvious fulfillment in Jesus. The Messiah was to be a Jew who brought light to the Gentiles (Isaiah 42:6-7; 49:5-6). He was to be born a human son, yet he preexisted as God (Micah 5:2; Isaiah 9:6-7). He will be humble yet exalted (Daniel 7:13-14; Zechariah 9:9). He will suffer ignominiously yet be vindicated and exalted as universal ruler (Psalm 22; Isaiah 52:13&#8211;53:12). He will be both king and priest, offices kept separate in Judaism (Psalm 110).14 Newman also cites prophecies indicating that the Messiah would come toward the end of the Second Temple period (ca. 515 b.c.&#8211;a.d. 70), making it impossible that any individual living after that time could be the Messiah (Haggai 2:3-9; Daniel 9:24-27).15\n \n These three types of fulfilled prophecies in the Bible add up to an impressive array of evidences that evidentialists believe are unparalleled and should be quite convincing. The skeptic whose worldview excludes divine fulfillment of prophecy is advised that the evidence is sufficient to call such a worldview into question. So Newman concludes, &#8220;one would be a fool to keep appealing to accident when the evidence suggests one&#8217;s worldview is faulty.&#8221;16 Fulfilled prophecy, then, not only provides evidence for the inspiration of the Bible, but for evidentialists it also contributes to the case for the theistic worldview.\n \n Evidentialists are not alone in using fulfilled prophecy as part of their apologetic. However, while evidentialists use it to prove the existence of God, classical apologists generally do not. Norman Geisler, for example, states plainly: &#8220;Fulfilled prophecy does not prove the existence of God, but it does show that unusual events predicted in his Name that come to pass are evidence of his special activity.&#8221;17Bible.org: Presenting Evidence That Demands a Verdict",

Connecting a deity and the winter solstice was also very common (and again, it wasn't specifically in the bible, but imposed \n by roman tradition later).\n\n \n Tsk tsk\n \n Here are the claims of parallels between Jesus and Horus, with responses: \n \n 1) Horus was born of the virgin Isis-Meri on December 25th in a cave/manger with his birth being announced by a star in the East and attended by three wise men. \n \n Let's take this one apart and deal with each separate issue: \n \n Horus' mother was not a virgin. She was married to Osiris, and there is no reason to suppose she was abstinent after marriage. Horus was, per the story, miraculously conceived. Seth had killed and dismembered Osiris, then Isis put her husband's dead body back together and had intercourse with it. In some versions, she used a hand-made phallus since she wasn't able to find that part of her husband. So while it was a miraculous conception, it was not a virgin birth. \n \n Horus was given three different birthdates in mythology, one of which does correspond to December 25th. But since Jesus wasn't, per the evidence, born on 12/25, this isn't a parallel. \n \n \"Meri\" (technically \"Mr-ee\") is the egyptian word for \"beloved\" and was apparently applied to Isis prior to Jesus' time, as a title, not as part of her name. But since there were probably thousands of women between Horus' time and Jesus' with a name or title that was a variation on \"Mary\", there's no real reason to suppose that Jesus' mother was named after Isis in particular. \n \n Horus was born in a swamp, not a cave/manger. Acharya's footnotes for this point only make the claim that Jesus was born in a cave, and say nothing about Horus being born in one. \n \n Horus' birth was not announced by a star in the east \n \n There were no \"three wise men\" at Horus' birth, or at Jesus' for that matter (the Bible never gives the number of wise men, and they showed up at Jesus' home, not at the manger, and probably when Jesus was a year or two old). \n \n Acharya's source for the last two claims appears to be Massey, who says \"the Star in the East that arose to announce the birth of the babe (Jesus) was Orion, which is therefore called the star of Horus. That was once the star of the three kings; for the 'three kings' is still a name of three stars in Orion's belt . . . \" Massey's apparently getting mixed up, and then the critics are misinterpreting it. Orion is not a star, but a constellation, of which the 'three kings' are a part. And even if there is a specific star called 'the star of Horus', there's no legend stating that it announced Horus' birth (as the critics are claiming) or that the 'three wise men' (the three stars in Orion's belt) attended Horus' birth in any way. \n \n 2) His earthly father was named \"Seb\" (\"Joseph\"). \n \n First of all, there is no parallel between the Egyptian name \"Seb\" and the Hebrew name \"Joseph\", other than the fact that they're common names. Also, Seb was Osiris' father, not Horus'. \n \n 3) He was of royal descent. \n \n This one's true! But it's not really a comparison to Jesus. When followers speak of Jesus being of 'royal descent', they usually mean His being a descendent of King David, an earthly king. Horus was, according to the myth, descended from heavenly royalty (as Jesus was), being the son of the main god. \n \n 4) At age 12, he was a child teacher in the Temple, and at 30, he was baptized, having disappeared for 18 years. \n \n He never taught in any temple and was never baptized. Also, Jesus didn't 'disappear' in the years between His teaching in the temple and baptism. He worked humbly as a carpenter. \n \n 5) Horus was baptized in the river Eridanus or Iarutana (Jordan) by \"Anup the Baptizer\" (\"John the Baptist\"), who was decapitated. \n \n Again, Horus was never baptized. There is no \"Anup the Baptizer\" in the story. \n \n 6) He had 12 disciples, two of whom were his \"witnesses\" and were named \"Anup\" and \"Aan\" (the two \"Johns\"). \n \n Horus had four disciples (called 'Heru-Shemsu'). There's another reference to sixteen followers, and a group of followers called 'mesnui' (blacksmiths) who join Horus in battle, but are never numbered. But there's no reference to twelve followers or any of them being named \"Anup\" or \"Aan\". \n \n 7) He performed miracles, exorcised demons and raised El-Azarus (\"El-Osiris\"), from the dead. \n \n He did perform miracles, but he never exorcised demons or raised his father from the dead. Also, Osiris is never referred to as 'El-Azarus' or 'El-Osiris' (clearly an attempt to make his name more closely resemble the Bible's \"Lazarus\"). \n \n 8) Horus walked on water. \n \n No, he did not. \n \n 9) His personal epithet was \"Iusa,\" the \"ever-becoming son\" of \"Ptah,\" the \"Father.\" He was thus called \"Holy Child.\" \n \n Horus was never referred to as \"Iusa\" (nor was anyone in Egyptian history - the word does not exist) or \"Holy Child\". \n \n 10) He delivered a \"Sermon on the Mount\" and his followers recounted the \"Sayings of Iusa.\" \n \n Horus never delivered such a sermon, and, as pointed out above, he was never referred to as \"Iusa\". \n \n 11) Horus was transfigured on the Mount. \n \n No, he was not. \n \n 12) He was crucified between two thieves, buried for three days in a tomb, and resurrected. \n \n Horus was never crucified. There's an unofficial story in which he dies and is cast in pieces into the water, then later fished out by a crocodile at Isis' request. This unofficial story is the only one in which he dies at all. \n \n 13) He was also the \"Way, the Truth, the Light,\" \"Messiah,\" \"God's Anointed Son,\" the \"Son of Man,\" the \"Good Shepherd,\" the \"Lamb of God,\" the \"Word made flesh,\" the \"Word of Truth,\" etc. \n \n The only titles Horus is given are \"Great God\", \"Chief of the Powers\", \"Master of Heaven\", and \"Avenger of His Father\". None of the above titles are in any Egyptian mythology. \n \n 14) He was \"the Fisher\" and was associated with the Fish (\"Ichthys\"), Lamb and Lion. \n \n He was never referred to as \"the fisher\", and there are no lamb or lion in any of the stories. Acharya S.'s footnotes on this claim only show an association with fish (which is that Horus WAS a fish, unlike Jesus), with no evidence of his being called 'the fisher' or having any association with a lamb or lion. \n \n 15) He came to fulfill the Law. \n \n There was no \"law\" he was supposed to fulfill. \n \n 16) Horus was called \"the KRST,\" or \"Anointed One.\" \n \n He was never referred to by either of these titles. \"Krst\", in Egyptian, means \"burial\", by the way. It wasn't a title. \n \n 17) Like Jesus, \"Horus was supposed to reign one thousand years.\" \n \n No mention of this in Egyptian mythology. \n \n Jesus & Horus Parallels - A Christian Response\n \n You're busted, again Trebor.",

And my so called cut and paste job is still waiting for any one of you mental midgets to refute the common sense value of the methodology which historians rely on in order to attack the evidence from multiple angles in order to prove or disprove its veracity.\n \n I want to repeat a quote from the link I posted above just to outline why you can never discover the truth regarding the truth of the bible. It's because you refuse to go into any study with an objective and open mind. Here is how the link puts it:\n The first step for evidentialists such as Montgomery, then, is to defend the biblical writings, not as infallible Scripture, but as historically credible and reliable documents. Securing belief in God is not considered a prerequisite to taking this first step; only clearing away any methodological or philosophical assumptions that prejudge the question of the truth of the biblical narratives is necessary. So, for example, in his book History and Christianity, Montgomery details \"four common errors\" in the anti-Christian polemic of philosopher Avrum Stroll before beginning his apologetic proper: (1) Stroll relies almost exclusively on modern \"authorities\" of a radically rationalistic sort (17-18).2 (2) Stroll ignores the evidence of the earliest primary documents, specifically the letters of Paul (18-19). (3) Stroll begs the question by assuming that the miraculous events reported in the Gospels could not have happened simply because they were miraculous (19-21). Note that Montgomery does not argue here that miracles are possible; he simply objects to the assumption that they are impossible. (4) Stroll engages in groundless historical speculation when he suggests that the Christian view of Jesus was the product of \"messianic fever\" in first-century Judaism (21-22).\n \n Having cleared away these errors, Montgomery begins his positive case with this disclaimer: \"We won't naively assume the 'inspiration' or 'infallibility' of the New Testament records and then by circular reasoning attempt to prove what we have previously assumed. We will regard the documents, even though today they are usually printed on fine India paper with verse numbers, only as documents, and we will treat them as we would any other historical materials\" (25-26).\n \n To assure his readers he is employing an unbiased method of treating the historical reliability of the New Testament, Montgomery chooses tests of reliability drawn from a textbook on English literary history by a military historian.3 These are the bibliographical, internal, and external tests (26). Montgomery and other evidentialists use this threefold test regularly to defend the historical reliability of the New Testament.4\n \n In closing, since you don't know me at all let me assure you that if I thought for a second that the available historical evidence regarding the bible was fraudulent or manipulated in any way, and had no confidence in its veracity, I would have real problems trusting it as I do. In bible college we studied the historical evidence in detail from objective sources and with objective outlooks. I never attempted once to force the evidence to fit the outcome I desired and neither did any source I relied on. Unlike the so called science of evolution, and those who worship at its throne of lies, we bible students want the absolute truth and nothing more, or less.",

   "Prove it.\n \n \n \n Tsk tsk\n \n Here are the claims of parallels between Jesus and Horus, with responses: \n \n 1) Horus was born of the virgin Isis-Meri on December 25th in a cave/manger with his birth being announced by a star in the East and attended by three wise men. \n \n Let's take this one apart and deal with each separate issue: \n \n Horus' mother was not a virgin. She was married to Osiris, and there is no reason to suppose she was abstinent after marriage. Horus was, per the story, miraculously conceived. Seth had killed and dismembered Osiris, then Isis put her husband's dead body back together and had intercourse with it. In some versions, she used a hand-made phallus since she wasn't able to find that part of her husband. So while it was a miraculous conception, it was not a virgin birth. \n \n Horus was given three different birthdates in mythology, one of which does correspond to December 25th. But since Jesus wasn't, per the evidence, born on 12/25, this isn't a parallel. \n \n \"Meri\" (technically \"Mr-ee\") is the egyptian word for \"beloved\" and was apparently applied to Isis prior to Jesus' time, as a title, not as part of her name. But since there were probably thousands of women between Horus' time and Jesus' with a name or title that was a variation on \"Mary\", there's no real reason to suppose that Jesus' mother was named after Isis in particular. \n \n Horus was born in a swamp, not a cave/manger. Acharya's footnotes for this point only make the claim that Jesus was born in a cave, and say nothing about Horus being born in one. \n \n Horus' birth was not announced by a star in the east \n \n There were no \"three wise men\" at Horus' birth, or at Jesus' for that matter (the Bible never gives the number of wise men, and they showed up at Jesus' home, not at the manger, and probably when Jesus was a year or two old). \n \n Acharya's source for the last two claims appears to be Massey, who says \"the Star in the East that arose to announce the birth of the babe (Jesus) was Orion, which is therefore called the star of Horus. That was once the star of the three kings; for the 'three kings' is still a name of three stars in Orion's belt . . . \" Massey's apparently getting mixed up, and then the critics are misinterpreting it. Orion is not a star, but a constellation, of which the 'three kings' are a part. And even if there is a specific star called 'the star of Horus', there's no legend stating that it announced Horus' birth (as the critics are claiming) or that the 'three wise men' (the three stars in Orion's belt) attended Horus' birth in any way. \n \n 2) His earthly father was named \"Seb\" (\"Joseph\"). \n \n First of all, there is no parallel between the Egyptian name \"Seb\" and the Hebrew name \"Joseph\", other than the fact that they're common names. Also, Seb was Osiris' father, not Horus'. \n \n 3) He was of royal descent. \n \n This one's true! But it's not really a comparison to Jesus. When followers speak of Jesus being of 'royal descent', they usually mean His being a descendent of King David, an earthly king. Horus was, according to the myth, descended from heavenly royalty (as Jesus was), being the son of the main god. \n \n 4) At age 12, he was a child teacher in the Temple, and at 30, he was baptized, having disappeared for 18 years. \n \n He never taught in any temple and was never baptized. Also, Jesus didn't 'disappear' in the years between His teaching in the temple and baptism. He worked humbly as a carpenter. \n \n 5) Horus was baptized in the river Eridanus or Iarutana (Jordan) by \"Anup the Baptizer\" (\"John the Baptist\"), who was decapitated. \n \n Again, Horus was never baptized. There is no \"Anup the Baptizer\" in the story. \n \n 6) He had 12 disciples, two of whom were his \"witnesses\" and were named \"Anup\" and \"Aan\" (the two \"Johns\"). \n \n Horus had four disciples (called 'Heru-Shemsu'). There's another reference to sixteen followers, and a group of followers called 'mesnui' (blacksmiths) who join Horus in battle, but are never numbered. But there's no reference to twelve followers or any of them being named \"Anup\" or \"Aan\". \n \n 7) He performed miracles, exorcised demons and raised El-Azarus (\"El-Osiris\"), from the dead. \n \n He did perform miracles, but he never exorcised demons or raised his father from the dead. Also, Osiris is never referred to as 'El-Azarus' or 'El-Osiris' (clearly an attempt to make his name more closely resemble the Bible's \"Lazarus\"). \n \n 8) Horus walked on water. \n \n No, he did not. \n \n 9) His personal epithet was \"Iusa,\" the \"ever-becoming son\" of \"Ptah,\" the \"Father.\" He was thus called \"Holy Child.\" \n \n Horus was never referred to as \"Iusa\" (nor was anyone in Egyptian history - the word does not exist) or \"Holy Child\". \n \n 10) He delivered a \"Sermon on the Mount\" and his followers recounted the \"Sayings of Iusa.\" \n \n Horus never delivered such a sermon, and, as pointed out above, he was never referred to as \"Iusa\". \n \n 11) Horus was transfigured on the Mount. \n \n No, he was not. \n \n 12) He was crucified between two thieves, buried for three days in a tomb, and resurrected. \n \n Horus was never crucified. There's an unofficial story in which he dies and is cast in pieces into the water, then later fished out by a crocodile at Isis' request. This unofficial story is the only one in which he dies at all. \n \n 13) He was also the \"Way, the Truth, the Light,\" \"Messiah,\" \"God's Anointed Son,\" the \"Son of Man,\" the \"Good Shepherd,\" the \"Lamb of God,\" the \"Word made flesh,\" the \"Word of Truth,\" etc. \n \n The only titles Horus is given are \"Great God\", \"Chief of the Powers\", \"Master of Heaven\", and \"Avenger of His Father\". None of the above titles are in any Egyptian mythology. \n \n 14) He was \"the Fisher\" and was associated with the Fish (\"Ichthys\"), Lamb and Lion. \n \n He was never referred to as \"the fisher\", and there are no lamb or lion in any of the stories. Acharya S.'s footnotes on this claim only show an association with fish (which is that Horus WAS a fish, unlike Jesus), with no evidence of his being called 'the fisher' or having any association with a lamb or lion. \n \n 15) He came to fulfill the Law. \n \n There was no \"law\" he was supposed to fulfill. \n \n 16) Horus was called \"the KRST,\" or \"Anointed One.\" \n \n He was never referred to by either of these titles. \"Krst\", in Egyptian, means \"burial\", by the way. It wasn't a title. \n \n 17) Like Jesus, \"Horus was supposed to reign one thousand years.\" \n \n No mention of this in Egyptian mythology. \n \n Jesus & Horus Parallels - A Christian Response\n \n You're busted, again Trebor.\n\n \n Except, of course, those aren't my points,.. and I pointed out the specific text that with my claim..

Little bits and pieces have been borrowed from here and there to make up a conglomeration.. and then a few unique bits added on.\n \n For example.. let's look at horus.. from the Egyptian book of the dead.\n \n He was born in a cave.\n \n The ancient Egyptians had a ritual where they paraded a manger and child around the streets at the winter solstice. \n \n Of course, the date celebrated by Christians was chosen a few hundred years after the alleged birth of Jesus.. and is not biblical. But hey, what the heck.\n \n His birth was announced by angels.. and witnessed by Shepards. The star Sirirus announced his birth (Very arch typical of deities). He was baptised by\n Anup the Baptiser Anup is another name for Anubis the annointer/embalmer. This is in the Egyptian book of the dead, in the iwhere Anubis is sending off people to the underworld (papyrus of Neb-get)\n \n Those are not unique to Horus and Jesus also.. that pattern is very typical of myths in the middle east. Connecting a deity and the winter solstice was also very common (and again, it wasn't specifically in the bible, but imposed \n by roman tradition later).\n",

If you can't get that,well, you can run and hide.\n\n \n :xbanghead\n \n Silly me for thinking you'd actually read and respond to what I wrote. I'll say it one last time before I place you on ignore. Here is what you quoted:\n \n \nAn or Ani, a name or form of Ra, the Sun-god (compare \"Ani at the head of the cycle of the gods,\" Gr\u00e9baut, Hymne, p.\n 22), and also of Osiris. Ani is also identified with the Moon-god; compare {footnote p. 255}[*] \"Hail, Ani, thou shinest\n upon us from heaven every day. May we never cease to behold thy rays! Thoth protecteth thee and maketh thy soul to\n stand up in the maat boat in thy name of Moon.\" For the identification of Ani with Horus, see Naville, La Litanie du Soleil,\n p. 99, note 10. The god Ani is also addressed as \"Eye of Horus \" by the deceased in the 39th chapter of the Book of the\n Dead, which refers to the \"uniting of a soul to its body in the underworld.\"\n\n \n Now, considering that nowhere in the above is the word \"Anubis\" or \"Anup\" written, how in the holy #### do you deduce that Anubis is \"also known as 'The eye of Horus'\"? It says Ani is \"a name or form of Ra.\" It says Ani is also Osiris. It says Ani is identified with Horus. It says Ani is addressed as \"Eye of Horus.\"\n \n What does it not say again? It does not say that Anubis is known as the Eye of Horus. One more time. Of the various gods the above claims is identified with the name Ani, which one, starting with an \"A\" and ending with \"nubis\" does it not mention? It happens to be Anubis.\n \n Ra. Osiris. Horus. Eye of Horus. But not which other? Yep, it does not say Anubis.\n \n No. Anubis. How terribly, terribly simple is that, and how poor a reader or utterly dishonest does one have to be to not acknowledge it?\n \n You make me embarassed to be an atheist. Bye-bye.",

   "I'll try to be brief.\n \n \nHello, Art,\n \n What do you make of the following?\n \n It is true that Judea did not technically become a Roman province until 6 AD, but the facts prior to that indicate much tighter authority and control than your statement might lead one to believe.\n\n \n Miller would have us believe the relationship between Rome and Jewish Palestine was in some sense extraordinary because he wants to allow the possibility of a census in Judaea before 6 CE. But the relationship was just like any other relationship between Rome and a client kingdom, and there is zero reason to think there was a census in Judaea before Archelaus was deposed/Judaea-Samaria was made into a province.\n \n \nRome did a military conquest before Herod the Great was even born. Pompey attacked Jerusalem and even invaded the Temple. was made a tributary (read: PAID TRIBUTE$) to Rome until Caesar defeated Pompey in Egypt around 48 BC.\n\n \n This is true, for what it's worth. Hyrancus and his brother Aristobulus had been waging a civil war against each other, and when Pompey rolled into Syria, both of them pleaded for his help. When Aristobulus p issed him off, Pompey diverted his attack on the Nabateans and laid seige to Jerusalem, defeating Aristobulus' forces, taking a peek inside the Holy of Holies, and installing Hyrcanus as a client king.\n \n But of course, this isn't extraordinary. Pompey was going around conquering everyone. If you cooperated, you had a chance to stay in power. Right after Pompey returned to Rome, his general Marcus Aemilius Scaurus went about laying waste to Nabatea as Pompey had originally intended. At the behest of Antipater (Herod's father), king Aretas agreed to tribute.\n \n \nHerod the Great's dad had aided Caesar in that endeavor and so won the favor of Julius Caesar (and with it a procuratorship of, plus Roman citizenship and exemption from taxes.) Then in 47 BC, the daddy Herod appointed the son Herod to be governor of Galilee...still completely under Roman rule.\n\n \n As above, the outline is true; Antipater aided Augustus and gained his favor. He also appointed Herod to govern Galilee. But this situation was no more one of \"Roman control\" than in any other client kingdom. There is no room for a Roman census here.\n \n \nHe still had to be appointed tetrarch by Antony-- still a thrall, eh?!. He was also proclaimed 'king' by the Roman leaders (Octavius and Antony) in 40 bc--but he had to re-conquer the land from the Parthians, which he did in 37bc. As a 'client kingdom', they were still under the authority of Rome (all of the rulers, for example, were appointed--including ALL the Herods--and ratified by Rome.)\n\n \n The terms of client kingship frequently included things like Roman veto over rulers. This is still not extraordinary, and still does not allow room for a Roman census under Herod.\n \n \nThe client-kings WERE still subject to Roman enrollment decrees. [see Blaiklock, The Century of the New Testament,(1962) and The Archeology of the New Testament (1970)]\n\n \n A Roman census was used to assess persons and property for the purposes of taxation. Because client kingdoms were not taxed (directly; they paid tribute collected internally), the subjects of client kingdoms would never be subject to census. We know that Quirinius conducted such a census in 6 CE when Judaea-Samaria was incorporated into the Empire, so there is no reason to suppose Luke had in mind any other.\n \n I strongly suspect, therefore, that Blaiklock has no primary data to offer in support.\n \n \nJudea - Chronology \n until 63 BCE - independent state \n 63 BCE-6 CE - client kingdom of Rome \n 6-41 - Roman province \n \n Judea: Encyclopedia - Judea\n \n c) Josephus explicitly states that Herod the Great (73 B.C. - 4 B.C.) paid Roman tribute to Octavian/ Augustus; and he also took responsibility for the tribute on lands he leased from Cleopatra and parts of Arabia (Ant. 15.96, 106-7, 132-33).\n \n .Herod Antipas ruled Galilee and Perea from 4 BCE-39 CE with the status of tetrarch (Luke 3:1; Josephus, War 1.668; Ant. 17.188). The title of tetrarch was determined both by his father's will and his status as a Roman client controlling a relatively small district.\n \n \n Galilean Fishing Economy\n\n \n All of this is true.\n \n \nI also picked the following up from a poster at another forum, though I cannot vouch for its merits:\n \n Nazareth was the childhood home of Jesus and where he labored as a carpenter. Recently though, archaeological investigations within the city have yielded new insight into the city's cultural diversity and may even explain why it was held in contempt in the days of Christ. In the summer of 2003, forensic archaeologists and biblical scholars descended on a small souvenir shop owned by the family of a Christian Arab by the name of Elias Shama. It seems that in the previous years, Shama had been doing a little exploring in the basement of his shop. Shama discovered some 4 foot high passageways seperated by small brick columns all leading to a walled-off room. Inside here, underneath a white marble floor, were ash residues indicating the presence of a once functioning furnace. When Shama finally shared the news of these findings, many here-to-before uninterested parties became quite interested.\n \n It seems these passageways, or tunnels, were the foundations of a very large Roman style bathhouse dating from the time of Christ. An expert on Holy Land digs, Professor Richard Freund, believes the significance of such findings \"cannot be overstated.\" \n \n I am sure that what we have here is a bathhouse from the time of Jesus and the consequences of that for archaeology, and for our knowledge of the life of Jesus, are enormous.\n \n \n Further excavations even showed an older bathhouse under the one discovered by Shama. Radiocarbon dates have yet to be released but the presence of the underfloor system of heating channels and the \"cold room\" leave no doubt as to its usage and the stratigraphy leaves little doubt as to its proximity to the time of Christ.\n \n These findings also change a historians view of the place and significance of Nazareth in the Roman Empire. Until now, Nazareth was perceived as a small and poor Jewish settlement where families lived in hillside caves. A village where Jesus would have had little or no contact with Romans or their culture until he parted as an adult. But the size of this giant bath, large enough to serve a large Roman garrison, leads scholars to believe that Nazareth may have been the \"local hub of military control from Rome\" instead of the previously perceived village of Sephori. This would indicate that Joseph, Mary, and Jesus actually lived in the \"very heart of Roman military power\" and would give Jesus the opportunity to be fully indoctrinated in Roman customs and to be understanding and tolerant of Roman culture. \n \n Much lies in the balance here. Further excavation has been halted by both financial and political roadblocks, but some day Shama hopes to continue and possibly uncover trinkets and artifacts from where Jesus lived. His shop is close to collapsing due to the excavations on the bathhouse project but he remains optimistic in spite. Shama hopes one day, \"to make the bathhouse of Jesus live again, just like it was 2000 years ago.\"\n \n Nazareth@Everything2.com\n \n I had heard the 'Roman Garrison' in Nazareth theory before, thought it's been a number of years.\n\n \n Two things. First, i'm unaware of any published reports on the ostensible bathhouse, so all these issues will have to wait. Second, i'm extremely skeptical of any Roman military presense in Galilee during the period. As I've written elsewhere:\n \n After Antony's troops aided Herod the Great in his conquest of the throne, a legion commanded by one Julius remained stationed around Jerusalem until 30 BCE (An. 15.3.7). However, subsequent support was called upon from the legions garrisoned in Syria (which usually numbered four, though these were sometimes called out to battle elsewhere, as in the case of Rome's war against the Parthians). Thus, Chancey (2006) calls attention to the apparent absense of Roman troops during the episode of state-sanctioned banditry in Trachonitis (An. 15.10.1), Herod's war with the Nabateans (An. 16.9.1) and the violence that followed Herod's death (An. 17.10.1). After Herod's son Archelaus was deposed, his soliders would have passed to the Romans where they would serve as auxilary troops.\n \n \nAnyway, contrary to some anti-Biblical skeptics, I do believe Nazareth existed at the time of Christ, due to pottery shard findings, etc.\n\n \n It clearly existed. The fact that the only people claiming otherwise are a biologist (Frank Zindler), a piano teacher (Rene Salm) and a computer salesman (Kenneth Humphreys) should give one pause.\n \n Random examples I can dig up in two seconds:\n \n Pfann et al (2007, pgs. 71-72), their report on the excavation of the Nazareth terrace farms: Figs 40:2-3,5-7 are examples of Hellenistic jars or jugs. 40:4 is a Hellenistic or Early Roman storage jar. 38:6 is an Early Roman casserole or krater. 38:3 is a Herodian storage jar.\n \n There is Alexandre's forthcoming Hellenistic, Hasmonean and Early Roman coins from Mary's Well (quoted in Pfann & Rapuano 2008).\n \n Etc.",

However, I will continue to comment on your bad information, and correct it so the observers can make up their own mind about who makes more sense.\n \n The whole 'Joseph went to Bethlehem to be part of a census' story totally discredits 'Luke/acts'.

This was after Terah died. Thus, Terah could have been no more than 145 when he died; or Abram was only 75 years old after he had lived 135 years.\n\n \n Terah could have STARTED bearing at age 70 (following the pattern of the genealogy in which the childless years are mentioned first) and Abram could have been born last when Terah was 130. This is not unreasonable since Abram himself bore children later than that. (Genesis 17:17 indicates he was ten years older than Sarah. Genesis 23:1 says Sarah died at 127. Genesis 25:1-2 tells us that Abraham was still bearing children with his subsequent wife several years later.) Furthermore, Abraham's brother got married, had Lot, and died ALL before Abram got married. So Abram's brother, Haran, would have been MUCH older.\n \n Creation Science Evangelism | Now Reading &ldquo;Contradictions in the Bible? (02)&rdquo;\n \n Or,\n \n Many have assumed that because Genesis 11:26 states, &#8220;Now Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran,&#8221; that Abram (also known as Abraham; cf. Genesis 17:5) was Terah&#8217;s firstborn, and that he was born when Terah was 70. The truth is, however, Abraham was not born for another 60 years. When Stephen was delivering his masterful sermon recorded in Acts 7, he stated that Abraham moved to the land of Palestine &#8220;after the death of his father [Terah&#8212;EL]&#8221; (7:4). Yet if Terah was 205 years old when he died (Genesis 11:32), and Abraham departed Haran when he was 75 (Genesis 12:4), then Terah was 130, not 70, when Abraham was born. In light of this information Henry Morris and John Whitcomb have aided us in better understanding Genesis 11:26 by paraphrasing it as follows: &#8220;And Terah lived seventy years and begat the first of his three sons, the most important of whom (not because of age but because of the Messianic line) was Abram&#8221; (1961, p. 480).\n \n Apologetics Press - How Old Was Terah When Abraham Was Born?\n \n \n\n Time for some New Testament falsities:\n \n MT 26:49-50, MK 14:44-46 Jesus is betrayed by Judas with a kiss, then seized.\n LK 22:47-48 Jesus anticipates Judas' kiss.

No kiss is mentioned.\n\n \n The Luke verse is an argument from silence, though similar to what follows: Nowhere in the John account does it say \"...that Judas could not get close enough to Jesus to kiss him. Not being able to get close to him had nothing, therefore, to do with whether he kissed him or not.\" You haven't made your case.\n \n 101 Cleared-up Contradictions[1].doc\n \n \nMT 28:1 The first visitors to the tomb were Mary Magdalene and the other Mary (two).\n MK 16:1 Both of the above plus Salome (three).\n LK 23:55 - 24:1, 24:10 Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and \"other women\" (at least five).\n JN 20:1 Mary Magdalene only (one).\n \n MT 28:1 It was toward dawn when they arrived.\n MK 16:2 It was after sunrise.\n LK 24:1 It was at early dawn.\n JN 20:1 It was still dark.\n \n MT 28:1-2 The stone was still in place when they arrived.

   "Superficial. The main answer to these is this: \"Genesis 1 is chronological, revealing the sequential events of the creation week, whereas Genesis 2 is topical, with special concern for man and his environment,\" and is addressed in the following article:\n \n Apologetics Press - Are There Two Creation Accounts in Genesis?\n \n \n \n Terah could have STARTED bearing at age 70 (following the pattern of the genealogy in which the childless years are mentioned first) and Abram could have been born last when Terah was 130. This is not unreasonable since Abram himself bore children later than that. (Genesis 17:17 indicates he was ten years older than Sarah. Genesis 23:1 says Sarah died at 127. Genesis 25:1-2 tells us that Abraham was still bearing children with his subsequent wife several years later.) Furthermore, Abraham's brother got married, had Lot, and died ALL before Abram got married. So Abram's brother, Haran, would have been MUCH older.\n \n Creation Science Evangelism | Now Reading &ldquo;Contradictions in the Bible? (02)&rdquo;\n \n Or,\n \n Many have assumed that because Genesis 11:26 states, \"Now Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran,\" that Abram (also known as Abraham; cf. Genesis 17:5) was Terah's firstborn, and that he was born when Terah was 70. The truth is, however, Abraham was not born for another 60 years. When Stephen was delivering his masterful sermon recorded in Acts 7, he stated that Abraham moved to the land of Palestine \"after the death of his father [Terah-EL]\" (7:4). Yet if Terah was 205 years old when he died (Genesis 11:32), and Abraham departed Haran when he was 75 (Genesis 12:4), then Terah was 130, not 70, when Abraham was born. In light of this information Henry Morris and John Whitcomb have aided us in better understanding Genesis 11:26 by paraphrasing it as follows: \"And Terah lived seventy years and begat the first of his three sons, the most important of whom (not because of age but because of the Messianic line) was Abram\" (1961, p. 480).\n \n Apologetics Press - How Old Was Terah When Abraham Was Born?\n \n \n \n The Luke verse is an argument from silence, though similar to what follows: Nowhere in the John account does it say \"...that Judas could not get close enough to Jesus to kiss him.

You ignorantly state that we as a group who are like minded, then we must have no thoughts of our own. But you are blind to the fact that you unbelievers who are secular in your thinking also are like minded as a group in your opposition to our spiritual beliefs, and have no original thoughts of your own either.

We all inherited the sin nature so God has freely offered us a way out of the guilt which comes with it through Jesus.

Remsburg's The Christ: A Critical Review and Analysis of the Evidence of His Existence, lists the following writers who lived during the time, or within a century after the time, that Jesus is supposed to have lived:\n \n Josephus \n Philo-Jud\u00e6\u00e6us \n Seneca \n Pliny Elder \n Arrian \n Petronius \n Dion Pruseus \n Paterculus \n Suetonius \n Juvenal \n Martial \n Persius \n Plutarch \n Pliny Younger \n Tacitus \n Justus of Tiberius \n Apollonius \n Quintilian \n Lucanus \n Epictetus \n Hermogones Silius Italicus \n Statius \n Ptolemy \n Appian \n Phlegon \n Ph\u00e6\u00e6drus \n Valerius Maximus \n Lucian \n Pausanias \n Florus Lucius \n Quintius Curtius \n Aulus Gellius \n Dio Chrysostom \n Columella \n Valerius Flaccus \n Damis \n Favorinus \n Lysias \n Pomponius Mela \n Appion of Alexandria \n Theon of Smyrna \n \n Enough of the writings of the authors named in the foregoing list remains to form a library. Yet in this mass of Jewish and Pagan literature, according to Remsburg, \"aside from two forged passages in the works of a Jewish author, and two disputed passages in the works of Roman writers, there is to be found no mention of Jesus Christ.\" Nor, do any of these authors make note of the Disciples or Apostles -- increasing the embarrassment from the silence of history concerning the foundation of Christianity.",

In as much as Jesus simply mirrored many other so-called messiahs pre-dating him, you haven't commented on that.

Many of these people are of the same prejudice organizations such as the Family Research Council. Want to hear another one of your supporters Easy? Here I'll post it for you..\n \n \n Towleroad.com\n Bishop Harry Jackson, the leader of the crusade against Washington D.C.'s equality laws, spoke at the Values Voter Summit over the weekend, asking conference attendees to tone down their racism against Obama because it'll be harder for him to convince his followers to mobilize against gays.\n \n He also claims the LGBT movement is a bunch of elite lawyers who are trying to prevent poor Blacks from voting to save hetero marriage:\n \n Says Jackson: \"[The so-called persecuted gay movement] is a handful of privileged people who are intolerant of anybody with another idea who want to oppress and suppress the truth in the name of freedom.\"\n \n \n King: Same-sex marriage a &#8217;socialist concept&#8217; Iowa Independent\n \n Same-sex marriage is not only a radical social idea, it is a \"purely socialist concept\" and is part of a broader push by to turn the United States into a socialist country, U.S. Rep. Steve King said Wednesday during an interview with a conservative talk radio station.\n U.S. Rep. Steve King\n \n U.S. Rep. Steve King\n \n King was being interviewed in regards to what he believes is the impact of the Iowa Supreme Court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage. He repeated his earlier assertion that the Hawkeye State will become a \"Mecca for same-sex marriage,\" then explained that Iowans do not have \"a very good understanding of what same-sex marriage does to the overall institution of marriage.\"\n \n In order for a socialist society to come about, the foundation of society, i.e., marriage, must be destroyed, King said.\n \n \"If there's a push for a socialist society, a society where the foundations of individual rights and liberties are undermined and everybody is thrown together living collectively off of one pot of resources earned by everyone, this is one of the goals they'd have to go to, is same sex marriage, because it has to plow through marriage in order to get to their goal,\" King said. \"They want public affirmation. They want access to public funds and resources. Eventually all those resources will be pooled because that's the direction we're going. And not only is it a radical social idea, it is a purely socialist concept in the final analysis.\"\n \n However, as the Raw Story's Daniel Tencer points out, King manages to ignore historical fact in his assessment of socialism and homosexuality.\n \n In the \"socialist paradise\" known as the Soviet Union, Josef Stalin criminalized homosexuality with a punishment of up to five years of hard labor. Some historians have argued that many individuals accused of pedophilia in the Soviet Union were in fact engaged in adult homosexual relationships.\n \n Sweden, long considered a social democracy, is today a leader in the gay rights movement; but in 1979, it declared homosexuality an \"illness.\" Transvestitism was only de-listed as an illness in Sweden in 2008.\n \n King also defended former Sen. Rick Santorum,R-Pa., who said legal same sex marriages would open the door to legal polygamy or bestiality. Santorum will be speaking in Iowa Oct. 1.",

   "Easy, I have repented of my sins.\n\n \n Do you know what repenting of your sins means jason? Repenting means \"to turn away from\", to stop doing that which you have repented of.

If so, we have no disagreement here at all because you have fulfilled what Jesus asked of His followers and are sincerely attempting to be more like Him.

You may not be able to see it but I personally know. \n\n \n You are absolutely right, God does love you right now and will accept you as you are. But He doesn't want you to remain as you are but to grow to be more like Him which is why repent means to turn away from your sins. Stagnation causes death so you mustn't remain as you are if you are truly born again, but must grow in Him but you must strive to be more like the God who created you in His image and then took on life to become the perfect sacrificial lamb of God who died for your sins. \n \n \nI remember praying nightly begging God to stop me. Begging him to make me \"normal\". I began to despair. When the feelings not only continued but increased I loathed myself.

Repenting and accepting Jesus as ones savior is an action of faith which results in submitting to His authority over your life. That is what defines salvation. It is a positive act of faith in God that He is more able to lead us through life than we are from our finite perspective in this life. That translates to trusting Him to guide us and obeying His leadership in our life. \n \n Just as an infant is totally incapable of supporting himself for even the most basic aspects of life, so must we realize that we are completely incapable of affectively running our lives as we submit all control and authority for it over to our heavenly father. That is what real faith is. It means trusting God in all aspects of our life. To say I love you God but I will continue to cheat on my wife or have gay sex is to lie to ones self and to God at the same time because it goes against what the bible says about truly being committed to trusting God with ones life. \n \n Liken it to any other kind of relationship. If someone reached out to you in love, could you really have a relationship if everything you did hurt that person while at the same time assuring them that you care about them?

Such relationships did not exist in those times when scripture was written.\n \n Things have changed Archie. And Jesus knows the hearts and minds of every person. If only you knew what I knew. What I have seen. Gay couples going scared into a accepting church for the first time being told their whole lives they are sick or they are not worthy of the love of Christ because who they are.

   "Cheap lip service? Archie if you must know I do not engage in promiscuous sex outside of a committed relationship period.\n\n \n Evidently you don't know the definition of \"cheap lip service\" since this statement of justification encompasses it. Why is that? Because God doesn't tell homosexuals to remain monogamous, He tells you to turn away from the abomination of same gender sex. So even if I believe you will remain monogamous and committed for any length of time, which I don't for a second, That doesn't justify your rebellious lifestyle which goes against everything God wants for you.\n \n \n I value my partner more than that and I feel our love to be sacred. You see you generalize only about sex... It is not all about that I assure you. But you fail to see such things! Is it all about sex in your marriage? I hope not because it is empty... Such relationships did not exist in those times when scripture was written.\n\n \n You sound just like the adulterer who says how much he loves his wife as he is planning his next date to cheat on her on his upcoming business trip. Do you think that God honors his words of devotion as he is breaking his marriage vows to her? Of course you don't. And neither does He honor your commitment to a man whom just having a sexual relationship is an abomination in His sight. Can't you get that Jason? Your flowery words of love and commitment are meaningless in light of their unnatural perversion of what God considers to be pure and holy.\n \n \nThings have changed Archie. And Jesus knows the hearts and minds of every person. If only you knew what I knew. What I have seen. Gay couples going scared into a accepting church for the first time being told their whole lives they are sick or they are not worthy of the love of Christ because who they are. And then bursting into tears realizing there is hope! You do not see it Archie but I do...\n\n \n Sorry Jason, it is you who doesn't understand. Realizing they have a spiritual need and even acknowledging it to the point of repentance is wonderful. But if what they take from that experience is that they can accept Jesus without turning away from the sin of homosexuality, and they will be saved anyway, then they are continuing in the lie and deception of sexual immorality. Just as the adulterer who accepted Jesus out of consciousness of his sin, but he continues to commit the sin of adultery. His faith also is in vain.\n \n So stop telling me I don't get it Jason, cuz I get it just fine. You continue to lie to yourself as you attempt to justify your sin by sounding and appearing religious as you deny the power there of. \n \n \nArchie I agree. But stagnation is of doing nothing. I am doing. I am growing. I am a voice for those who have none and I bring a message of hope and love to those who have been shut out from that all their lives. These are loving couples and people who only want to be loved. And yet all their lives have been turned away for who they are..\n\n \n You, my friend are a vapid proponent of sin and death who thinks more of himself than he ought to. You are a liar who preaches a false gospel of a selfish love which you try to make appear righteous and good when it is vacuous and empty in its content. You like to think you're growing, but you are as stagnant as a dead pool. \n \n \nArchie like I said it is not about sex. It is deeper. You fail to see it. Because you do not know the pain and the strife gays and lesbians especially those of faith go through every single day. If only you knew or could feel what we feel, maybe then you would realize how difficult it really is and the despair many feel..\n\n \n You need to learn Jason that repeating a lie or a self delusion doesn't make it anymore true the second time you repeat it. Your words which appear righteous are still wrong, and lies no matter how many times you say them.\n \n \nArchie I do not think you can measure the love of Christ. I cannot I assure you. I can only tell you of the loving guiding hand He has placed upon gays and lesbians of faith. I do not think God would want His gay and lesbian children to despair of life through suicide and drug addiction. But it is happening Archie. Many whom have been raised in a faith based family feel through stigma and prejudice and stereotype that there is no place for them in this world or the next. But that is wrong. And so is the assumptions placed upon gays and lesbians.\n\n \n I agree that the love of Christ cannot be measured. but what does the truth of that statement have to do with the lie that God accepts homosexual sex between two men or women? The answer is nothing at all. You refuse to get that you are perverting Gods word by attempting to say that any of us can accept Christ as our savior yet remain in sin and conscious rebellion against Him in our active lifestyle. It is a lie and a self delusion and that person will ultimately be a tree with dead fruit. You seem incapable of realizing that you are opposing God Himself by defending and justifying homosexual sex which He has condemned in every verse which discusses the issue. \n \n \nWe are as diverse as straits and just as passionate and loving, and willing to fight for those whom we love and cherish and hold dear to us including the one who redeemed us and loves us for who we are. Not what we are labeled as...\n\n \n I have repeatedly said that God loves the homosexual and will meet them where they are in their spiritual condition. Just as God will meet any other type of sinner where they are at the moment in their current spiritual condition. But God insists that we all repent and turn away from our predominant sins as we start to grow IN HIM as redeemed children of God whom the Holy Spirit has come into as proscribed in the Gospel. But for you to teach or encourage others that they can accept the Lord and continue in the sin of homosexuality is to be a tool of the devil and a deceiver as you corrupt Gods truths in order to satisfy your own guilty conscience and remain within your sinful lifestyle with a self described impunity.",

You think all gays and lesbians are nothing but sex addicted rebellious people... You refuse to acknowledge there are actual committed loving couples and families....\n \n And Archie it is not a \"lifestyle\". Just because I am gay doesn't mean I'm a drag queen or a hairdresser or that I have a lisp or I drive a powder blue Prius.. These are all misconceptions just like your definition of being gay as a \"lifestyle.\"\n \n \n \n \n \nYou sound just like the adulterer who says how much he loves his wife as he is planning his next date to cheat on her on his upcoming business trip.

Why then are there so many interpretations of Christianity? Why so man denominations? Why are those who embrace LGBT peoples with open arms and those that string them up and lynch them, or tie them to a post and leave the, to die like Matthew Sheppard? It is all point of view mixed with opinion, and ignorance... Do not compare my loving relationship to my partner with that of a cheating spouse.... Doing so just shows how out of touch you really are on the subject..\n \n \nSorry Jason, it is you who doesn't understand.

Just as the adulterer who accepted Jesus out of consciousness of his sin, but he continues to commit the sin of adultery. His faith also is in vain.\n\n \n Archie sadly you do not realize nor will you ever realize the struggle gay peoples of faith have endured. Many have committed suicide, or loathed religion because of your black and white perception of salvation. These so called cases of \"cured\" homosexuals are just as sad as those who were attempted to be cured by the Nazis by being forced to sleep with women, or to be castrated... Being gay is not an illness and there is not so called twisted \"cure\", only repression and isolation of one's self to their own demise...\n \n \n \nSo stop telling me I don't get it Jason, cuz I get it just fine. You continue to lie to yourself as you attempt to justify your sin by sounding and appearing religious as you deny the power there of.\n\n \n Appearing religious? Archie please if anyone here is trumping their faith all over the board it is you and Easy. Your the police of \"morality\" on this board... I am merely stating my religious views along with my political and ideological ones as well. I am not trying to be a show pony for Christ unlike yourself and other members of this forum...\n \n \n \nYou, my friend are a vapid proponent of sin and death who thinks more of himself than he ought to. You are a liar who preaches a false gospel of a selfish love which you try to make appear righteous and good when it is vacuous and empty in its content. You like to think you're growing, but you are as stagnant as a dead pool.\n\n \n Archie once again you insult and slander yet again. Just because my views are different from yours you call me a liar and a preacher of false gospel. Such is the MO for the fundamentalist who has nothing left to fling at someone in desperation than to call their views and faith false...\n \n You know nothing of me, and you know nothing of love or the love I share with my partner. It is not a selfish love but an unconditional love to the man of my dreams. There is nothing empty about my love toward him, and you trying to spin it as such is despicable...\n \n \n \nYou need to learn Jason that repeating a lie or a self delusion doesn't make it anymore true the second time you repeat it. Your words which appear righteous are still wrong, and lies no matter how many times you say them.\n\n \n Wrong Archie. They are my beliefs and what I feel in conviction despite what you try to spin or say, or use to diminish my views to others on this board... You may call me a liar or anything else, but others here see the truth in my words and that they indeed come from the heart..\n \n \n \n \n \nI agree that the love of Christ cannot be measured. but what does the truth of that statement have to do with the lie that God accepts homosexual sex between two men or women?

Why don't you try to understand gay people and our struggles before you play off of stereotype and ignorance... Why don't you read the accounts of those enslaved under Hitler, or those tortured under extremist regimes in Iraq, or those murdered under Franco, or those stabbed in the Castro. Or how about just recently the account of the gay man beaten in Queens which was caught on camera which I posted. \n \n Do not so idly play off what we have suffered and endured, and continue to endure. It is not rebellion, but the aching of the heart and the yearning for those whom we cherish and love deeply. So deep that we have payed the ultimate price for that love, and standing up for our right TO love archie!\n \n \n \n \nI have repeatedly said that God loves the homosexual and will meet them where they are in their spiritual condition.

Drawing a line in the sand based upon your own prejudice. You continue to use the word of god as a means of condemnation rather than conviction and hope. Why don't you actually talk to gay Christians and see. Why don't you talk to those gay couples that have been together for 20 30 years or more. Or how about the gay families raising children in a loving caring home...\n \n These people are not the tools of the devil.

One cannot just turn off ones feelings towards someone they love or cherish Archie, that is what you fail to realize.\n \n Trust me I would gladly if given the choice, be strait.

He is living proof of a fundamental literalist who is gripped by his faith and conviction. In my fathers words he is an aggressive salesman so to speak...\n \n Christ taught a message of love Trebor. He embraced the social outcasts of his time including women, lepers, the crippled, all those whom the religious elite of the day despised. Those whom they in privilege despised..\n \n The same can be said today Trebor. Those claiming to be Christian only go through the motions and fail to see the true meaning of unconditional love shown and taught through Jesus.\n \n These people are privileged like for example James Dobson, who is an avid and reckless propagator of anti LGBT bias and discrimination. Who claims that gay and lesbians are a threat to families even though they themselves have families of their own... He teaches that homosexuals can be reversed or \"cured\" when the AMA and other psychiatric organizations state clearly homosexuality is not a mental disorder and to try and repress their sexuality leads to dire consequences..\n \n He currently makes over 180 million a year...\n \n Pat Robertson is another. Claiming that gays and lesbians are destroying America. That we are the root of all evil and that we are wicked and try to \"recruit\" others to partake in our \"devious lifestyle\". Robertson makes over 500 million a year Trebor...\n \n These are the men Christ warned about! These charlatans preaching in His name to achieve their own biased agendas! To instill fear and distrust of other Christians just because they themselves may be gay or lesbian.\n \n Trebor, Christ was not an illusion. And even if He were, the teachings of this person were hope and love without prejudice. Sadly many literalist and fundamentalist Christians have forgotten that completely. In their fear and ignorance breeds anger and discord, which totally overshadows any true message Christ has shown...\n \n Do not be fooled by these people Trebor. There are many Christians who are accepting and loving to all peoples without prejudice. And we have enough respect and decency to express our views, yet respect and admire even those who may have different beliefs and views of their own. Such should be of all who claim to be saved and follow Christ.\n \n Anything less is sheer hypocrisy....",

Yes to that as well.\n \n Why is your being able to validate the authenticity of scripture of importance?\n Because if you feel compelled to admonish, lecture and condemn people using the bible as the reason for and the right to do so, I would think that it would be important that that which justifies your actions be legitimate. Do you not agree?\n \n I actually can cite a number of passages that have been omitted, altered or mistranslated, but I will simply ask two questions. \n \n Why are there so many different bibles? All of which claim to be true and accurate, which is impossible.\n \n Why are there estimated to be over 38,000 Christian denominations? 150 with over 1 million members. That is a lot of people who think they have it right but don't. \n \n If the intent of the Devil is to lead the masses away from God, he seems to be doing a reaonably good good job.\n \n Perhaps if God could have devised a better means of informing us of his requirements this confusion may have been avoided. Maybe the whole making everybody speak different languages thing wasn't a good idea after all.\n \n So how do you know your right? Or can we just agree that all this is your opinion, which is just another link in a long chain of opinions.",

And I say \"IS\" rather than refer to Him in the past tense because He is still alive and well on Planet Earth. \n \n But that wont stop the deniers from attempting to deny his existence. The hubris in addition to the ignorance required to deny His existence is mind boggling which is why I haven't bothered participating in this thread for months now. But let's see anyone disprove the common sense facts and reasoning this link offers. It dispels all of their irrational denials with historically sound reasoning which real historians utilize when determining if ancient historical considerations are valid and reasonable. \n THE EVIDENCE FOR JESUS'RESURRECTION.\n \n The most powerful sign of all that Jesus is who He claims to be, namely the Son of God, is His resurrection from the dead (Acts 2:29-36), Romans 1:4). Here again we are faced with a question of huge implications: Did it happen? Is the Easter story the great exception to the \"usual dreary end of human life?\" Some consider the resurrection of Jesus Christ to be superstition. But take notice of the following partial review of the evidences supporting it as one of the sure and certain events of history.\n \n A critical debate on the question \"Did Jesus rise from the dead?\" took place recently between world-renowned atheistic philosopher, Dr. Antony Flew, and New Testament scholar, Dr. Gary Habermas. A panel of five philosophers from leading universities judged the outcome. What was the conclusion? Four votes for Habermas. None for Flew. And one draw. One respondent to the debate, philosopher Charles Hartshorne, admitted against his own bias, \"I can neither explain away the evidence to which Habermas appeals, nor can I simply agree with Flew's or Hume's positions.\"20 Dr. Flew was judged to have retreated into philosophical sophistry while evading a whole host of widely-acknowledged historical facts.\n \n TWELVE WIDELY-ACKNOWLEDGED HISTORICAL FACTS\n \n These facts include: \"(1) Jesus died due to the rigors of crucifixion and (2) was buried. (3) Jesus' death caused the disciples to despair and lose hope. (4) ...Many scholars hold that Jesus' tomb was discovered to be empty just a few days later. (5) ...At this time the disciples had real experiences that they believed to be literal experiences of the risen Jesus. (6) ...The disciples were transformed from doubters who were afraid to identify with Jesus, to bold proclaimers of His death and resurrection, even being willing to die for this belief. (7) [The resurrection] was central to [their message] and (8) ...proclaimed in Jerusalem [where critics could easily examine the facts surrounding the tomb]. As a result... (9) the Church was born and grew, (10) with Sunday the primary day of worship. (11) James [Jesus' skeptical brother], and (12) Paul, the great persecutor of the faith, [were both converted by the resurrection].\"21\n \n So momentous was this single event in the First Century, its effects have been described as a \"widening circle of ripples\" from \"a boulder crashing into the pool of History.\" 22 In one of the oddest turns in history, a message resting on the death of a condemned outcast (1 Corinthians 1:23) came to be proclaimed as the foundation for \"good news\"-which is what the word Gospel means. Equally amazing was the extent of the transformation of the Mediterranean world following from its proclamation. The impetus for this movement was the conviction that the same Jesus who was crucified was now seen alive again. These facts are admitted even by knowledgeable skeptics.23\n \n The Easter story, of course, has had its critics, ever since Day One. From the account of the first guards in Matthew 28:11f, all the way to the present, there have been efforts to explain away the resurrection. Each new attempt, however, is more perverse than those which came before,24 while still failing to account for the range of indisputable facts. Let's look at the weaknesses of six objections most frequently leveled by critics.\n \n OBJECTION: \"THE EASTER ACCOUNTS ARE MYTH; NOT HISTORY.\"\n \n ANSWER: Negative critics charge that the Gospels have cloaked the original \"primitive\" Jesus (who is represented in the hypothetical Gospel of Q-see endnote 19), in layers of legend and myth.25 Yet there are at least FOUR REASONS why the mythological interpretation fails. Firstly, comparative literature demonstrates that myth requires a number of generations to develop. There are simply no parallels in other literature of myth developing and being believed in the presence of eye-witnesses and within the short time-frame in which the New Testament was formed.26 Secondly, many of these eye-witnesses to His public ministry were hostile toward the Jesus the Gospels describe (Matthew 12:22f). These opponents had both the motives and the means to correct falsehoods about Him had the first disciples attempted them.27 Yet their opportunity did not produce a serious correction. Thirdly, the Gospels are demonstrably independent from the mystery religions. Nor do they resemble either pagan myth or Jewish legend.28 Rather, the Gospels are absent of embellishment and naked in their descriptions. They betray no burning desire to persuade. They also lack theological reflection, but to the contrary, use rather \"primitive\" language (\"the first day of the week\"-Matthew 28:1, John 20:1, as opposed to \"on the third day\"-1 Corinthians 15:4). They also contain other details that are counter-productive to the invention of legendary heroes. For example, the following six factors in John chapter 20 are at odds with the tendency of legendary material: a) With great restraint, no attempt is made to describe the actual drama itself of Jesus rising from the dead. b) Mary neither recognized Jesus (the \"hero\") initially (v.14), c) nor even considered there was anything special about Him (v.16). d) Indeed, even by the end of the day His disciples were still in hiding \"for fear of the Jews\" (v.19). e) And were the Gospels the product of paternalistic (male dominant) bias, as feminists charge, it is incredible their alleged \"inventors\" would have chosen to create women as the first witnesses of the Risen Jesus. The testimony of women didn't even count legally in ancient Middle Eastern cultures.29 f) Yet it was their courage going to the tomb on Easter morning that effectively put the men's contrasting cowardice to shame. Fourthly, the Jews were the poorest candidates for inventing a mythical Christ. No other culture in history has more opposed mythically confusing deity with humanity, than they.30\n \n OBJECTION: \"MIRACLES ARE NOT POSSIBLE.\"\n \n ANSWER: The success of modern science in explaining the world in terms of cosmic regularity has led some to rule out miracles as an outmoded and impossible concept. Yet that is an unwarranted philosophical assumption and not a scientific conclusion. And philosophy cannot dogmatically forbid miracle apart from proof of no reality outside of nature. Once the existence of a transcendent, wise and powerful God (as in the God of Israel) is granted as a possibility, miracles can't be dismissed out of hand. For the actual strength of the case for His existence consider the 2nd reference in both endnotes no. 1 and 36. Skeptical prejudice typically leads to an evasion of the evidence, rather than to that kind of critical analysis which is required on a case-by-case basis.31\n \n OBJECTION: \"THE BODY WAS STOLEN.\"\n \n ANSWER: The tomb was indeed empty.32 Yet neither the Jewish nor the Roman leaders, who had the tomb guarded (Matthew 27:62f), would have taken the body. Rather, both had every motive to produce the body publicly in order to humiliate the first disciples and nip their movement in the bud. And since the scene in question was right at Jerusalem, it was completely within their power to locate the corpse should it still have existed. Yet to their dismay, no such body was ever produced.\n \n In addition to the hostile guards, Jesus' followers likewise had no incentive for hiding the corpse to pretend the resurrection. The dire consequences of their loyalty to Him included beating, imprisonments, and even death. No sane person chooses these for what they know is false. Under such pressures liars confess their deceptions and betray their cohorts.\n \n Some assert, however, that Jesus was raised only spiritually and not bodily, so that whether the body remained in the tomb is irrelevant. But Jewish anthropology rejected both the body/soul dualism and the notion of the immortality of the soul of Greco-Roman thought. Judaism could not conceive of a \"spiritual\" resurrection without a body. And if it indeed actually had happened that Jesus' body remained in the grave, Paul's teaching on the resurrection of the body (1 Corinthians 15) would have attempted to reconcile the apparent contradiction.33\n \n OBJECTION: \"JESUS MERELY RECOVERED FROM HIS WOUNDS\".\n \n ANSWER: Crucifixion was in reality an excruciating experience-indeed, these two words are clearly related. The cause of death by crucifixion was multi-factorial and torturous! These factors included exhaustion asphyxia, dehydration, and congestive heart failure.34 That Jesus could have survived such agony on a Roman cross, to limp out of the tomb by His own power is improbable enough! That His bloodied appearance could have been overlooked, so that He could deceive despairing disciples into believing He was the \"Risen Lord of Life\" is absurd! And such an attempt would have incriminated Jesus as a fraud. Only a supernaturally raised Jesus was capable of healing and empowering the broken hearts of the disciples.\n \n OBJECTION: \"THE WITNESSES WERE JUST 'SEEING THINGS.'\"\n \n ANSWER: On one point virtually all scholars of every stripe agree: The first disciples were themselves utterly convinced they had seen the risen Christ.35 The Easter message breathes through virtually every New Testament document. So the real question is, how do we account for their obvious conviction? Were they just hallucinating? While sounding plausible, many factors contradict it.36 For one, the large number of witnesses (1 Corinthians 15:5-8), covering the spectrum of personality types (John 20 -- Peter, Thomas, the two Marys, etc.), contradict the theory of hallucinations which, by definition, are not shared experiences. Also, the substantial, permanent, and positive change in lifestyle of many of the converted overthrows any theory of hallucination. Jewish scholar, Dr. Pinchas Lapide, has written:\n \n When this frightened band of Apostles suddenly could be changed over-night into a confident mission society...Then no vision or hallucination is sufficient to explain such a revolutionary transformation.\n \n \n OBJECTION: \"THE EASTER STORIES ARE FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS.\"\n \n ANSWER: The Gospels admittedly take work to reconcile. But this problem, as it is typically framed, is vastly overstated. It is important to note that a contradiction goes beyond two parties merely sharing differing sets of observations (which may both finally be shown to be true). Contradictory observations must be shown to be impossible to reconcile. It is true that Matthew focuses on Jesus' Galillean appearances while Luke gives his entire attention to His appearances in Jerusalem. Yet neither says He only appeared in their respective areas. So there is no reason to infer from either of them dishonesty or ignorance of the larger story. Reporters to any event (secular or religious), following all standards of accuracy and integrity, will each edit their stories differently with their eyes on what is relevant to their readers. Since none of the Gospel writers were \"under strict orders\" to tell absolutely everything Jesus ever did, the rigid demands of the hypercritics that all four Gospels tell exactly the same story, are arbitrary and artificial. Regarding Easter morning's first hours, Dr. Sayers provides urgently needed common sense by writing:\n \n One is often surprised to find how many apparent contradictions turn out to be not contradictory at all, but merely supplementary... Divergences appear very great on first sight... But the fact remains that all of the [Easter accounts], without exception, can be made to fall into a place in a single orderly and coherent narrative, without the smallest contradiction or difficulty and without any suppression, invention, or manipulation, beyond a trifling effort to imagine the natural behavior of a bunch of startled people running about in the dawnlight between Jerusalem and the garden.38\n \n FURTHER EVIDENCE FOR THE RESURRECTION\n \n The explosive growth of the Church demands the resurrection of Jesus to account for it. It wasn't the powerful, backed by armies, wealth, and prestige, but mere commoners,39 burdened with every cultural strike against them (1 Corinthians 1:26f), whose Easter message peacefully overcame the Roman Empire. Who could have predicted such an impossible feat? Yet the \"impossible\" actually did happen!40\n \n That Christianity had its origin in Judaism41 is further evidence for His resurrection. What else could have led so many Jews who had longed for a military deliverer, instead to accept a shamefully hung \"criminal\" (Galatians 3:13) as their promised Messiah? And what else could have moved Jews to break their monotheistic42 convictions to worship Jesus as God the Son (John 1:18, Acts 6:7), or change their day of worship from Saturday to Sunday (Acts 20:7)? Jewish bias against the Jesus of the New Testament was massive. A mere invented myth would have been powerless to overthrow their hopes and traditions in favor of a condemned outcast.43 Neither could metaphor have empowered Jews into their willing martyrdom.\n \n In addition, the conversion of Saul of Tarsus points to a momentous miracle. Without question something major happened to this most influential figure of the entire 1st Century apart from Christ.44 Having begun as a violent enemy of the Church (Acts 8:3; 9:1), he was utterly turned around into becoming Jesus' servant. Henceforth choosing suffering for Christ's sake (2 Corinthians 11:23f), Paul gave up all he had, endured persecution, and preached \"Christ crucified\" in city after city all the way to Rome, where he died a martyr's death. For reasons described in the previous paragraph, his new faith was \"miles\" from a natural progression out of Judaism. Nor was his conversion impelled by a sense of guilt and inadequacy. Rather, he had been a proud and satisfied Pharisaic Jew (Galatians 1:13-15, Philippians 3:4-7). Nothing short of an encounter with the risen Christ has remotely explained his major about-face.\n \n The other Apostles also, overcame fear to brave suffering, imprisonment, and death as they proclaimed the Good News of the Risen Christ across their world. Is it thinkable these people would die so willingly for merely a myth?45 In contrast to others who have died for an unverifiable hope beyond the grave (e.g. mystics seeking reincarnation or Moslem militants expecting reward from Allah), Jesus' disciples lived and died for the publicly verifiable claim that the grave was empty and He was seen alive again. Legal scholar, Dr. Simon Greenleaf, writes::\n \n Propagating this new faith, even in the most inoffensive and peaceful manner, [early Christians received] contempt, opposition ...and cruel deaths. Yet this faith they zealously did propagate, and all these miseries they endured undismayed, nay rejoicing. As one after another was put to a miserable death, the survivors only [continued] their work with increased vigor and resolution...The annals of military warfare afford scarcely an example of like heroic constancy... and unblenching courage...If it were morally possible for them to have been deceived in this matter, every human motive operated to lead them to discover and avow their error...From these [considerations] there is no escape but in the perfect conviction and admission that they were good men, testifying to that which they had carefully observed...and well knew to be true.46\n \n THAT CONCLUSION WHICH LEADS TO A NEW BEGINNING\n \n \"Easter is not primarily a comfort, but a challenge,\" writes J.N.D. Anderson, late Dean of the School of Law at the University of London \"...If it is true, then it is the supreme fact of history, and to fail to adjust one's life to its implications means irreparable loss.\"47\n \n Indeed, this essay is not about mere historical curiosity, but about an event of enormous consequences to you. For according to Romans 1:4, Jesus' resurrection affirms the Bible's high claims about Him (see p. 2 of this essay), and that He is the way to heaven that God has provided (John 14:6, Acts 4:12). It guarantees there will be a Last Judgment (Acts 17:31), and that there is a Heaven and a Hell (Revelation 1:18). Yet this Risen Christ offers the forgiveness of sins and everlasting salvation for whoever believes in Him (John 11:25,26, Romans 4:24,25). Everyone is inescapably affected by these implications. Therefore you cannot afford to remain an agnostic regarding Jesus and His claim on you. While many today are indifferent to such matters, avoiding Him is not an honest proposition. The mounting evidence supporting His claims demands your consideration.\n \n And consideration is demanded not only for your intellect, but for your whole being! For the One who is \"Alive forevermore\" (Revelation 1:18) says, \"Behold I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and [fellowship with you]\" (Revelation 3:20). By \"door\" is meant access to your heart, mind, and will. Jesus wills entry into your life that He may be your Savior and Lord. So \"Today...Do not harden your heart\" (Hebrews 4:7). Rather, open your heart, and let the One who died and rose for you come in! Simple Catholicism by Fr. Phil Bloom\n ",

   "Not about to go through all of that, and point out different things that would support my thoughts, but I can say that there is proof, and I will only give one example, although you are free to go through and debate it:\n \n The Historical Jesus is a reconstruction of Jesus using modern historical methods.\n \n Paul Barnett pointed out that \"scholars of ancient history have always recognized the 'subjectivity' factor in their available sources\" and \"have so few sources available compared to their modern counterparts that they will gladly seize whatever scraps of information that are at hand.\" He noted that modern history and ancient history are two separate disciplines, with differing methods of analysis and interpretation.[126]\n \n In The Historical Figure of Jesus, E.P. Sanders used Alexander the Great as a paradigm-the available sources tell us much about Alexander's deeds, but nothing about his thoughts. \"The sources for Jesus are better, however, than those that deal with Alexander\" and \"the superiority of evidence for Jesus is seen when we ask what he thought.\"[127] Thus, Sanders considers the quest for the Historical Jesus to be much closer to a search for historical details on Alexander than to those historical figures with adequate documentation.\n \n Consequently, scholars like Sanders, Geza Vermes, John P. Meier, David Flusser, James H. Charlesworth, Raymond E. Brown, Paula Fredriksen and John Dominic Crossan argue that, although many readers are accustomed to thinking of Jesus solely as a theological figure whose existence is a matter only of religious debate, the four canonical Gospel accounts are based on source documents written within decades after Jesus' lifetime, and therefore provide a basis for the study of the \"historical\" Jesus. These historians also draw on other historical sources and archaeological evidence to reconstruct the life of Jesus in his historical and cultural context.\n \n In contrast, Charles Guignebert, Professor of the History of Christianity, at the Sorbonne, maintained that the \"conclusions which are justified by the documentary evidence [concerning the life of Jesus] may be summed up as follows: Jesus was born somewhere in Galilee in the time of the Emperor Augustus, of a humble family, which included half a dozen or more children besides himself.\"[128] (Emphasis added). He adds elsewhere \"there is no reason to suppose he was not executed\".[129]\n \n Recent research has focused upon the \"Jewishness\" of the historical Jesus. The re-evaluation of Jesus' family, particularly the role played after his death by his brother James,[130] has led scholars like Hans K\u00fcng to suggest that there was an early form of non-Hellenistic \"Jewish Christianity\" like the Ebionites, that did not accept Jesus' divinity and was persecuted by both Roman and Christian authorities. K\u00fcng suggests that these Jewish Christians settled in Arabia, and may have influenced the story of Christ as portrayed in the Qu'ran[131].\n \n \n Now, I do not agree with all that was said in that article, however, I do agree with some of it, and the point that I am trying to make is contained in that article, although I know that someone is going to pick through it, and show me where I am wrong, even though I have just stated that I don't agree with everything that was said in said article.

   "[QUOTE]\nAnswer what? The resurrection happened.\n \n \n Maybe, but if Jesus is God as you say, then it is not possible for him to have died and without that there is no salvation thru faith. Since you missed the earlier question I will save you some time by answering your first objection. Saying that only his human aspect experienced death ignores his divine and immortal aspect as well as his being one of the trinity. Being omnipotent means nothing but a temporary alteration of his physical existence at that moment. What is death to an entity that has no need for organs, blood, air or any of the things we as mortals need to be considered alive? \n \n The omnipotence of God, the Trinity, the dual nature of Jesus and the resurrection are not all compatible. The Holy Spirit may guide you to the truth and the devil may guide you to what is false but you have to be willing to use some of the common sense God has endowed most humans with to see which is which.\n \n Blind faith is always going to be blind",

Sanders \n \n The Case Against Q Quotations\n \n Now, show me the historical, traditional, and archaelogical evidence for Q? Up until the last couple of centuries, no one had ever heard of Q, and there's simpler explanations for common material (the diciples shared accounts, the Holy Spirit revealed the information to them, etc.). Show me Q? \n \n We have no copies of Q, no copies of portions of Q, no references to Q in any of the early Christian writings, no references to Q in any of the early non-Christian writings, no references to Q in any of the gospels or the writings of Paul or the other letters; in fact, no conclusive evidence whatsoever that Q ever existed.\n \n It's nothing more than a hypothesis.\n \n The long and the short of the matter is that, for Mack, and for the post-Bultmannian school in general, this use of Q can be shown to be quite inconsistent, arbitrary, and circular. What furthers calls into question their perspective is that a large number of scholars outside of their camp, using different starting points and different criteria for redactional analysis, have come to very different understandings of (the supposed) Q.\n \n \"....they have deliberately remained vague about whether or not Q was one document, a loose assemblage of passages, or simply a convenient name for oral or 'floating' traditions . . . . This work is mostly of curiosity value, since it shows how far a hypothesis can be pushed despite its lack of fundamental support.\"",

Included also is a poem by E. L. Mascall. \n &#61623; Austin Farrer \n &#61623; E. L. Mascall \n &#61623; James Hardy Ropes \n &#61623; Morton Scott Enslin \n &#61623; John Drury \n &#61623; E. P. Sanders \n \n The Case Against Q Quotations\n \n Now, show me the historical, traditional, and archaelogical evidence for Q? Up until the last couple of centuries, no one had ever heard of Q, and there's simpler explanations for common material (the diciples shared accounts, the Holy Spirit revealed the information to them, etc.). Show me Q? \n \n We have no copies of Q, no copies of portions of Q, no references to Q in any of the early Christian writings, no references to Q in any of the early non-Christian writings, no references to Q in any of the gospels or the writings of Paul or the other letters; in fact, no conclusive evidence whatsoever that Q ever existed.\n \n It&#8217;s nothing more than a hypothesis.\n \n The long and the short of the matter is that, for Mack, and for the post-Bultmannian school in general, this use of Q can be shown to be quite inconsistent, arbitrary, and circular. What furthers calls into question their perspective is that a large number of scholars outside of their camp, using different starting points and different criteria for redactional analysis, have come to very different understandings of (the supposed) Q.\n \n &#8220;&#8230;.they have deliberately remained vague about whether or not Q was one document, a loose assemblage of passages, or simply a convenient name for oral or &#8216;floating&#8217; traditions . . . . This work is mostly of curiosity value, since it shows how far a hypothesis can be pushed despite its lack of fundamental support.\"\n\n \n You won't read it so I will just paste the link to where everything above is addressed. It will also provide evidence why most scholars think Q is more likely.\n \n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/q.html\n \n You really need to start paying attention. What started this adventure into Q? My stating that Matt and Luke were based on Mark and Q in response to your claim that there were 4 independent accounts of Jesus' life. In your moment of rapture thinking to trump the claim you post the above. Maybe there was no Q, maybe it did exist as an oral account or started that way, but regardless of whether it did or did not exist there is one thing that both sides agree on. Matthew and Luke are not independent. Matthew used Mark and Luke used either Mark, Matthew, Q or some combination. \n \n Your indie sources no more consist of all four",

   "The book of Acts records instances where the authorities took notice. Also, we have in the record that Pilate took notice of religious claims being made by a Samaratian and crushed them mercilessly--he was recalled and lost his post over that.\n \n \n And The Acts also state that the Sanhendrin decided to ignore them\nNo it doesn't. They were advised to. You've assumed that they followed it. Secondly, the Sanhedrim was in the hands of one faction of Jews (the Sadducees). The Pharisees were not controlled by them. Thirdly, they only had control in Palestine, not elsewhere.\n \n \nName them. Which of them was a threat to the establishment?\n\n \n The Pharisees and the Sadducchees had different ideas about Judiasm, so did the Ebonites and the Zealots were causing trouble. The disciples of John were wandering around somewhere and Baal always seemed to pop up and that doesn't get into the Roman Gods or Egyption or the numerous others in the region. \n \n To answer your question any one could have been but none were really considered anything but a distraction. Roman policy was minimal interference with religion and law in occupied nations (minimal varied depending on the emperor)\n\n \n The Sadducees were the establishment--why should they cause problem for themselves?\n \n There's no evidence that the disciples of John were causeing trouble.\n \n There's no evidence that the the followers of Baal were causing trouble at that time.\n \n There's no evidence that there were followers of Roman or Egyptian gods were operating in the area--or that they were causing any sort of trouble.\n \n Killing hundreds, if not thousands, of Samaratians hardly sounds like \"minimal interference.\"\n \n \nGranted and not relevant. If anything it reinforces the idea that this early church was weakening the established Jewish religion. That would explain why the relied, in part on the Roman gov't in their attacks on the apostles.\n\n \n Are you sure about both of these statements? I don't see Christianity undermining traditional Judaism to the point they somehow get the Romans to retaliate on their behalf.\nThe early Christian movement didn't have to undermine the religion globally--they only had to do it in one city (like Rome). Read Acts for other accounts of how the Jews tried to use the Romans to do their dirty work for them.\n \n \nPartly out of jealousy in the early Christians church success at converting Gentiles.\n\n \n God's chosen people were upset that the people God didn't want were becoming Christians? No that wasn't a reason of contention between Jews and Christians. Paul is the the reason Gentiles were accepted into Christianity at all.\nFirst of all, you are under the mistaken and false impression that the gentiles were not wanted by God. Secondly, Gentoiles were turning to Christianity long before Paul become the apostle to the Gentiles. Even during Christ's lifetime they were turning to Him.\n \n \nMost Christians in Jerusalem were NOT wiped out in 70 AD, they fled to Pella. \n\n \n Jerusalem Christians can trace the beginning of the end when Rome sacked Jerusalem. The leadership was gone, the followers that escaped were absorbed in Pauline Christianity. Both of which are reasons contributing to the gradual shift away from Judiasm. The Jerusalem Christians never recovered from the Roman Jewish war.\nI have no idea what the first sentence means. The second contradicts the evidence we have from within Acts. There was a gradual shift from Judaism because the Jews rejected Christianity. They later developed an oath against Christians that the attendees at the synygogue had to take. Up till then the early Christans saw themselves as a Jewish sect.",

The presupposutions generally fall on the side of Christians, who start with a beleif that the Gospels are fact and loo for evidence to support that. I don't say that there is no historical value to the Gospels. I don't suggest they be ignored and discarded as worthless fabrications.\n \n \n \nYou are mixing time frames.

I am not suggesting that the Gospel accounts be ignored. They of course have value providing insight into beliefs, ideas, social interaction, economics and so on, but they are used for more than that. Because we have something from the past doesn't automatically make it worthy as evidence to validate a specific event. If that were the case the Gnostic writings or even the Apocrypha would be used as more than a means of understanding different and opposing views in early Christianity. \n \n Your comparison of the Gospels and The Rubicon is flawed. The Rubicon has several things the Gospels do not. They share some things such as no originals, but the Rubicon has reliable 3rd party corroboration from neutral and opposing writers, the Gospels do not, While Caesar does not state I crossed the Rubicon, he does say where he was, followed by where he went. From point A to point B is a road that crosses the Rubicon and to go around wouldn't work. This isn't taken at face value, but other written evidence supports it. The Rubicon has coins and inscriptions attesting to written events, the gospels do not. There are other differences, but I think the point made all ready.\n \n The Gospels fall far short of possessing the credibility to say without question certain specific events happened as they describe. They are not originals, they have been accidentally and intentionally altered, they are not from eyewitnesses, they are not from neutral or 3rd party sources, which there is no evidence from and other reasons that while still being valuable historical documents make them questionable historical evidence.",

   "\"...they (Gospels) are not from eyewitnesses..\" \n\n \n Only if you were willfully ignorant of historical testimony would you conclude that. \n \n The second-century writer Papias wrote: Matthew made an arrangement of the oracles in the Hebrew language, and each translated them as he was able...\n \n Were you familiar with Eusebius (who quotes Origen), you would know that \"the first (Gospel) was written by Matthew...and was prepared for the converts from Judaism\" (Ecclesiastical History, 6:25). There is also additional evidence that it was originally written in Hebrew. Eusebius quotes Papias as stating, \"\"Matthew put together the oracles in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could.\" Irenaeus wrote, \"Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome and laying the foundations of the church.\"\n \n In addition, many of the disciples / Jewish converts had migrated to Antioch (in Syria) - Acts 11:19-27 - which is where many believe Matthew wrote his Gospel. \n \n Irenaeus testified on the authority of Polycarp (John's disciple) that John wrote the Gospel that bears his name while he was at Ephesus. Clement of Alexandria also confirmed John's authorship. In 2 Peter, Peter himself is identified as the author (3:1) who also wrote the first epistle (3:1). The first epistle idenfies Peter as the author (1:1). The author of 1st Peter identifies himself to be an eyewitness to Christ and his suffering (5:1). \n \n We also know that Mark was a close associate and interpreter for Peter (i.e. Papias and Irenaeus) who wrote Mark based on Peter's personal accounts. So, although there will always be skeptics such as yourself, the evidence seems pretty clear to me.\n \n The following are just some of the numerous eyewitness accounts contained in the Gospels and Epistles.\n \n Luke 24:30ff - When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. They asked each other, \"Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\" They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together 34 and saying, \"It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\" Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. \n \n Luke 24:36-39: While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\" They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. He said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\" \n \n John 20:16-18: Jesus said to her, \"Mary.\" She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, \"Rabboni!\" (which means Teacher). Jesus said, \"Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.' \" Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: \"I have seen the Lord!\" And she told them that he had said these things to her. \n \n John 20:19-20: On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. \n \n John 20:26-28: A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\" Thomas said to him, \"My Lord and my God!\" \n \n 1 Corinthians 15:3 -8: For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me also... \n \n Acts 1:1 -4: In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: \"Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. \n \n 1 John 4:14 - And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. \n \n 2 Peter 1:16 - We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.\n \n Luke 1:1-4: Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. \n \n Matthew 28:5-9: The angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.\" 8 So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them. \"Greetings,\" he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. \n \n Jesus IS Lord!",

   "Convienient would be to accept the Gospels at face value. The presupposutions generally fall on the side of Christians, who start with a beleif that the Gospels are fact and loo for evidence to support that. I don't say that there is no historical value to the Gospels. I don't suggest they be ignored and discarded as worthless fabrications.\nThat is the correct approach.\n \n \nIf that were the case the Gnostic writings or even the Apocrypha would be used as more than a means of understanding different and opposing views in early Christianity.\nThey are.\n \n \nYour comparison of the Gospels and The Rubicon is flawed. The Rubicon has several things the Gospels do not. They share some things such as no originals, but the Rubicon has reliable 3rd party corroboration from neutral and opposing writers, the Gospels do not, While Caesar does not state I crossed the Rubicon, he does say where he was, followed by where he went. \nThat's because you are going beyond the limits of the example--it is kind of like taking a parable literally, or engaging in allegory. The simple fact is that we do not have the originals of either and where the Goispels were written by eyewitnesses those who wrote about Caesar crossing the Rubicon were not. So, if one were to argue that we can dispose of the Gospels on those counts then you should do so for this. Secondly, you are expecting more for the Gospels than it is reasonable to expect.

   "That is the correct approach.\n\n \n Only if validating the the position is is superior to accuracy and truth. Looking to confirm introduces possible bias and justifies not considering credible contradictory evidence.\n \n \nThey are.\n\n \n How so? As far as I know there are no plans for Christians to adopt gnostic texts as suitable for anything. Same with Baptists and Methodists with the Apocrypha. The Gnostic texts had 15 minutes of fame where some tried to use them to refute Biblical texts, but that didn't last to long nor get very far. I haven't seen many protesters holding signs quoting the Gospel of Mary, haven't heard of any legislation coming from the The hymn of the pearl.\n \n \nThat's because you are going beyond the limits of the example--it is kind of like taking a parable literally, or engaging in allegory. The simple fact is that we do not have the originals of either and where the Gospels were written by eyewitnesses those who wrote about Caesar crossing the Rubicon were not.\n\n \n You seem to want to compare apples to oranges and then say apples are peaches. The comparison is made attempting to show a bias towards the Gospels as historic evidence. If anything it's a really poor comparison to make (I realize you didn't come up with this originally). Any document that has the potential to effect a significant number of people directly and everyone else indirectly is going to get far more scrutiny than a document that describes events whose repercussions have been absorbed and no longer have any current influence. \n \n The first books of Caesar's Civil War which include the period inclusive of the Rubicon crossing are accepted as being written by Caesar. The last books are disputed. Jesus wrote nothing. \n \n \nSo, if one were to argue that we can dispose of the Gospels on those counts then you should do so for this. \n\n \n One is not arguing that the Gospels be disposed of, nor is one basing any argument on their use on one factor or even two. The are no originals for either making any corroborating evidence that much more valuable. For the Rubicon it exists in the form of writings from neutral and opposing 3rd party sources written. Writers deemed credible based on confirmation of content of other written works.The Gospels do not. \n The Gospels have a significant number of variations, some of which are purposeful. The Rubicon has physical evidence in the form of coins and inscriptions. The Gospels do not.\n \n \n Secondly, you are expecting more for the Gospels than it is reasonable to expect. \n\n \n Thomas wanted to stick his fingers into Jesus' wounds because he couldn't believe his eyes, ears and the people around him. Sorry if 2000 years later those of us who have not received a visit from Jesus to discuss our views on Christianity ask for a little higher standard for what we think is credible support. Reasonable in this case is proportional to the ramifications or it matter as much as it matters. Their value as historical documents is validated almost simply by existing, but that is dwarfed by their value as Christian doctrine and this is what causes the intense evaluation of their contents.\n \n \nBecause Judea was a \"backwater\" for the Roman empire we will not have as much recorded material as we will for well known Roman figures. Even today with the internet the odds of you finding out about someone who was a homeless, unemployed, itinerant preacher is well nigh nill.\n\n \n We are'nt talking about Joe Roman losing his wife, house and job. This is the death and raising of the son of God. Even if you ignore all his works it seems hard to believe that he was raised and seen by 500+ people and if that isn't enough hundreds more crawled out of their graves to wander the city. Yet not a word is written.\n \n \nPartially answered above. And which came first the coins and inscriptions or the writings for whcih we do not have the poriginals and weren't written by eyewitnesses?\n\n \n The coins and inscriptions can be dated visually by the markings or text. \n What point are you trying to make here? You have already argued that lack of originals should not disqualify as evidence, so why now make it an issue?\n \n \n \nWho said they were? BTW, neither are the accounts of the crossing of the Rubicon originals.\n\n \n I didn't say the Rubicon docs were original \n \n \nIrrelevant, nothing of significance was changed. See the UBS Greek Bible and Bruce Metzger's Textual Commentary.\n\n \n It's a nice hope, but as has been pointed out a number of times there are no originals. It is therefore impossible to say with certainty the text has remained the same. It is believed based on all the documents that most of the additions and deletions have been identified. \n \n \nThey are and there's no evidence that they were not. BTW, we do know for a fact that the writers of the crossing of the Rubicon were not from eyewitnesses.\n\n \n Really, Luke was wandering around the whole time of Jesus ministry along with Mark taking notes? If not please explain then how they are eyewitnesses.\n \n You keep making a big deal about eyewitnesses, but make no comment on the credibility of eyewitness testimony, the accurracy of it, other evidence in support of it and so on.

   "Only if you were willfully ignorant of historical testimony would you conclude that. \n \n The second-century writer Papias wrote: Matthew made an arrangement of the oracles in the Hebrew language, and each translated them as he was able...\n\n \n This should be below under Eusebius since it's him quoting Papias. How many of his 5 books exist today, that would be none. All there is are a few quotes from him as recorded by others. Like Eusebius who didn't much care for him. He is also considered to have a tendency to embellish and he never spoke with an Apostle, only people who he says did. He wasn't a fan of the written word, thinking the spoken word was better, but he states it so let's say he is indeed giving a confirmation that at least by his time Mark & Matthew had Gospels that were known \n \n \nWere you familiar with Eusebius (who quotes Origen), you would know that \"the first (Gospel) was written by Matthew...and was prepared for the converts from Judaism\" (Ecclesiastical History, 6:25). There is also additional evidence that it was originally written in Hebrew. Eusebius quotes Papias as stating, \"\"Matthew put together the oracles in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could.\" Irenaeus wrote, \"Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome and laying the foundations of the church.\"\n\n \n Eusebius isn't known for having all his facts straight, Irenaeus is getting his information also from Papias, but they aren't writing about the Gospel in today's bible. It is believed papias is talking about a Gospel that has been lost. By the 18th century Christians were beginning to question if there ever really was Matthew Gospel in Aramaic using Hebrew letters. \n \n Won't you have to spend a weekend in the lake of fire for referencing Origen. I don't think the decree of anathema has been lifted.\n \n In addition, many of the disciples / Jewish converts had migrated to Antioch (in Syria) - Acts 11:19-27 - which is where many believe Matthew wrote his Gospel. \n \n \nIrenaeus testified on the authority of Polycarp (John's disciple) that John wrote the Gospel that bears his name while he was at Ephesus. Clement of Alexandria also confirmed John's authorship. In 2 Peter, Peter himself is identified as the author (3:1) who also wrote the first epistle (3:1). The first epistle idenfies Peter as the author (1:1). The author of 1st Peter identifies himself to be an eyewitness to Christ and his suffering (5:1). \n\n \n Hearsay and few people attributr 2 Peter to Peter. \n \n \nWe also know that Mark was a close associate and interpreter for Peter (i.e. Papias and Irenaeus) who wrote Mark based on Peter's personal accounts. So, although there will always be skeptics such as yourself, the evidence seems pretty clear to me.\n\n \n Eyewitness means pretty much what you would think it means. That the person saw the event. Luke is not an eyewitness, neither is Paul or most of the other authors of the NT for that matter. \n \n Mark wouldn't be an eyewitness, but supposedly it's all from Peter. Which should be considered when reliability is questioned. Odd how Paul has 18 letters, Matthew and John a Gospel each and despite Mark being nothing but a translator is given the title for, if you are correct, what is really the Gospel according to Peter. Instead there are but 2 letters from the man supposedly destined to be the foundation on which the Church is built. Strange how Mark got his information from Peter but doesn't say anything about that or the resurrection.\n \n If we ignore evidence that suggests the Gospels of today were not written by any of the Apostles they are named for, that doesn't prevent that they may have, but been lost or incorporated into other works, your eyewitnesses are reduced by 2. \n \n I see nothing wrong with questioning the authenticity of the Bible. I am not alone, Any Christian denomination that doesn't accept the Bible as inerrant is doing so because even they have some doubt .",

   "This should be below under Eusebius since it's him quoting Papias. How many of his 5 books exist today, that would be none. All there is are a few quotes from him as recorded by others. Like Eusebius who didn't much care for him. He is also considered to have a tendency to embellish and he never spoke with an Apostle, only people who he says did. He wasn't a fan of the written word, thinking the spoken word was better, but he states it so let's say he is indeed giving a confirmation that at least by his time Mark & Matthew had Gospels that were known \n \n Eusebius isn't known for having all his facts straight, Irenaeus is getting his information also from Papias, but they aren't writing about the Gospel in today's bible. It is believed papias is talking about a Gospel that has been lost. By the 18th century Christians were beginning to question if there ever really was Matthew Gospel in Aramaic using Hebrew letters. \n \n Won't you have to spend a weekend in the lake of fire for referencing Origen. I don't think the decree of anathema has been lifted.\n \n In addition, many of the disciples / Jewish converts had migrated to Antioch (in Syria) - Acts 11:19-27 - which is where many believe Matthew wrote his Gospel. \n \n Hearsay and few people attributr 2 Peter to Peter. \n \n Eyewitness means pretty much what you would think it means. That the person saw the event. Luke is not an eyewitness, neither is Paul or most of the other authors of the NT for that matter. \n \n Mark wouldn't be an eyewitness, but supposedly it's all from Peter. Which should be considered when reliability is questioned. Odd how Paul has 18 letters, Matthew and John a Gospel each and despite Mark being nothing but a translator is given the title for, if you are correct, what is really the Gospel according to Peter. Instead there are but 2 letters from the man supposedly destined to be the foundation on which the Church is built. Strange how Mark got his information from Peter but doesn't say anything about that or the resurrection.\n \n If we ignore evidence that suggests the Gospels of today were not written by any of the Apostles they are named for, that doesn't prevent that they may have, but been lost or incorporated into other works, your eyewitnesses are reduced by 2. \n \n I see nothing wrong with questioning the authenticity of the Bible. I am not alone, Any Christian denomination that doesn't accept the Bible as inerrant is doing so because even they have some doubt . \n\n \n <Flush<\n \n Excuses, excuses. I'll stick with what I posted.\n \n The material I posted beats the gradeau out of what you have for Q. But you believe Q instead. Oh ye of GREAT FAITH!",

   "When one denies that they can be used as a reliable evidencer that is the same thing.\n \n We work with what we have and what is within reason. We do not erect artificial barriers. OTOH, how many original mss of Caeser's do we have again?\n \n \n There aren'tanyoriginals about Caeser crossing the Rubicon or Boadicea either--and no one calls them a myth.\n\n \n \n Your ignoring the point. Whether Caesar crossed the Rubicon or the documents that say he did are original or from eyewitnesses is meaningless. If they are shown to true will a group of Christians march on Washington to demand all bridges be torn down or try and enact laws preventing them from being built? \n \n The documents are comparable as historical reference and should be judged by the same standards for their use in that capacity. As historical evidence used as the basis for introducing legislation or opposing it or as the source of a value system or guidelines for moral and ethical responsibilities or obligations they should be held to a considerably high level of scrutiny and failure to meet those standards should exclude them. If Christians wish to accept the conditions imposed on them by the Bible I have no problem with that, but don't make that choice for me and don't tell me I'm wrong when you can't prove your right\n \n \nWhere is it required that He do so?\n\n \n He isn't. \n \n Your not required to have a will either, but most would agree it's not very smart not to. Most would also agree that if you do a written version is much better than a verbal one.\n \n \nAh, so you believe an event actually happened when it is convenient. Keep reading and you'll find that he never did stick his finger into the wounds--and what did he exclaim?\n\n \n I could have used he huffed and he puffed and he blew the piggy's house down as an example, it doesn't mean I think it happened\n \n \nBy our standards. Work within the limits of that day. Now what do you get?\n\n \n We work within the context of the period to determine meaning, we don't subject the 21st century to 1st century logic and comprehension of it's physical surroundings.\n \n \nWe don't know whow many were raised from the dead at that time. They didn't use graves, they had tombs. Writing about it wasn't required. Work within the limits of the day.\n\n \n Graves were used, not everybody could afford a tomb and not everybody was allowed a tomb. You have numerous witnesses including the bodies themselves of an unspecified number of people who had been dead and buried returning to the city and then nothing. No panic in the streets, no awe, no questions, no statements, no nothing.\n \n I am working within what is reasonable for the period. The fact that we have written accounts of the period and area of events of far less significance isn't by itself enough to discredit the Gospels. When looking at evidence sometimes you find what you expect and sometimes you don't expect what you find. When 3rd party written accounts do appear they are not expected but not denied as support. It's all put together and then a conclusion is made.\n \n \nYou missed the point: which came first the coins or the writings? Anyone familiar with the times knows how coins can be dated.\n\n \n \n Oh come on. You think the Gospels are are ok but think someone forged a bunch of Roman coins to spread the lie that Caesar crossed the Rubicon. This is your point?\n \n \n \nWe can have a high enough degree of confidence that we can say that we have as close to the original as we will probably ever get. They had thousands of mss to work with. Only an XXXXX would expect a perfect copy.\n \n Sort of correct. The vast majority have been identified and none have affected any doctrine.\n\n \n Originals are not required to prove certain things or gather information concerning an event or something said. They are very helpful when your copies have been constantly tampered with and the first one you have is a few hundred years old. \n \n I am happy you feel safe that you have the the Bible the way God intended, should we stop looking to confirm that or is there enough doubt that the researchers should keep at it?\n \n Why would they change the word of God anyway? This should not even be a discussion. The very fact that it happened even once intentionally raises questions. The fact that it happened a number of times is sufficient reason to have considerable doubt.\n \n \n \nThey would have done that back then. When Paul pointed to the eyewitnesses, those who were opposed to the movement could have easily denied the events based on those very points if they had something that was real to work with. But, they couldn't destroy the eyewitness testimony because they knew it was true.\n\n \n What? Paul points to who? The opposition didn't deny the events? They had nothing real to work with? They knew it to be true? And I am a fool or XXXXX, but you feel perfectly fine posting this. Prove it.",

Perhaps this can happen concerning the spoken words of Jesus, but the description of events and given the length of the Gospels and that alone should be enough to look further.

Then later stating there was no copying. You state they are eyewitness accounts, then say Mark's source was Peter's Roman guards and that Luke used sources other than himself. All the while repeating the time you've spent researching this, giving each answer authoritativly, but becoming caustic when asked for a definitive answer. \n \n This led to methods and standards used to determine authenticity.

Jesus crucifixion and death \n \n a) Early (and enemy) attestation from the Apostle Paul - (1 Thessalonians 5:9-10, 2:15; 1 Corinthians 1:23, 2:2 and early creedal passages in 1 Corinthians 15:3 - ca. 50-60AD) \n b) Multiple attestation in all four Gospels and the Book of Acts (ca. 70-100AD) \n c) Enemy/neutral attestation from Jewish historian Josephus (Antiquities 18:64 - 96AD) \n d) Enemy/neutral attestation from Roman historian Tacitus (Annals 15:44 - ca. 115AD) \n e) Enemy/neutral attestation from Greek satirical writer Lucian (The Death of Peregrine, 11-13 - ca. 150AD) \n f) Enemy/neutral attestation from Talmud (Sanhedrin 43a - ca. 200AD) \n g) Principle of Embarrassment applies to the humiliating suffering and death of a supposed Messiah and the Son of God (as well as Principle of Dissimilarity from Jewish anticipation of a military type leader in the Messiah). \n \n Atheist NT scholar Gerd L&#65533;demann acknowledged, \"Jesus' death as a consequence of crucifixion is indisputable.\" Gerd Ludemann, The Resurrection of Christ, pg 50. \n \n The critical NT scholar and Jesus Seminar co-founder John Dominic Crossan wrote, \"Jesus&#65533; death by execution under Pontius Pilate is as sure as anything historical can ever be. For, if no follower of Jesus had written anything for one hundred years after his crucifixion, we would still know about him from two authors not among his supporters. Their names are Flavius Josephus and Cornelius Tacitus...We have, in other words, not just Christian witnesses but one major Jewish and one major pagan historian who both agree on three points concerning Jesus: there was a movement, there was an execution because of that movement, but, despite that execution, there was a continuation of the movement.\" John Dominic Crossan, Who Killed Jesus?, pg. 5 \n \n Crossan also said, \"Despite the differences between the studied impartiality of Josephus and the sneering partiality of Tacitus, they agree on three rather basic facts. First, there was some sort of a movement connected with Jesus. Second, he was executed by official authority presumably to stop the movement. Third, rather than being stopped, the movement continued to spread. There remain, therefore, these three: movement, execution, continuation. But the greatest of these is continuation.\" John Dominic Crossan, The Essential Jesus, p. 7. \n \n John P. Meier wrote, \"For two obvious reasons practically no one would deny the fact that Jesus was executed by crucifixion: (1) This central event is reported or alluded to not only by the vast majority of NT authors, but also by Josephus and Tacitus...(2) Such an embarrassing event created a major obstacle to converting Jews and Gentiles alike...that the Church struggled to overcome...\" (John P. Meier, \"The Circle of the Twelve: Did It Exist during Jesus' Public Ministry?\", Journal of Biblical Literature 116 [1997] p. 664, 665). \n \n FACT 2. The tomb was discovered empty. \n \n a) Early attestation from Paul - he implies an empty tomb (1 Cor. 15:3-4) \n b) Multiple attestation from all four Gospels (the very early Pre-Markan Passion source probably contained the empty tomb) \n c) The disciples were accused of stealing Jesus&#65533; body by unbelieving Jews - indirect enemy confirmation that the tomb was empty (Matthew 28, Christian apologist Justin Martyr Dialogue with Trypho 108 - ca. 150AD; Christian apologist Tertullian De Spectaculis 30 - ca. 200AD) \n d) The principle of embarrassment applies to the empty tomb reported as having been discovered by women \n e) We have no record of Jesus&#65533; corpse being produced only accusations that the disciples stole the body. \n f) Setting the stage for the empty tomb was the honourable burial of Jesus by Joseph of Arimethea (another fact we could admit as number 6 - but won't as it isn't really necessary to do so). It is attested by all four Gospels. As well Paul mentions the burial of Jesus(1 Cor 15). It also is strengthened by the Principle of Embarrassment where a Jewish member of the council, rather than a disciple or family member, that condemned Jesus was reported as honourably burring Jesus. This would have been offensive to the disciples and as such is unlikely to be a fabrication. \n \n Liberal theologian John A. T. Robinson commented on the burial of Jesus, \"[it is] one of the earliest and best&#65533;attested facts about Jesus.\" John A. T. Robinson, The Human Face of God (1973), p. 131. \n \n William Wand, a past Oxford University church historian wrote, \"All the strictly historical evidence we have is in favour [of the empty tomb], and those scholars who reject it ought to recognize that they do so on some other grounds than that of scientific history.\" William Wand, Christianity: A Historical Religion? (1972), p. 93-94 \n \n NT critic D. H. Van Daalen wrote, \"It is extremely difficult to object to the empty tomb on historical grounds; those who deny it do so on the basis of theological or philosophical assumptions.\" D.H. Van Daalen, The Real Resurrection(1972), p. 41. \n \n The apostles sincerely believed Jesus rose from the dead and then appeared to them. So sincerely that some were willing to endure persecution and possibly even death because of this belief: \n \n Claims of appearances to the disciples: \n \n a) Early (and enemy) attestation from Paul (1 Cor. 15:4-8) \n b) Multiple attestation from all four Gospels (even without the later addition of 16:9-20, early attestation in Mark's Gospel predicts the Rez and appearances in 8:31, 9:31, 10:34 and suggests there will be appearances made by Jesus 14:28, 16:6-7) \n c) Multiple attestation from the Book of Acts (ch. 1-5, 10, 13, 17) \n d) Possible neutral/enemy attestation from Tacitus (he may be inadvertently providing evidence that the apostles at least believed Jesus appeared to them in Annals 15:44 when he says, \"...[Christianity] thus checked for the moment [by the crucifixion of Jesus], again broke out not only in Judea...\") \n e) Possible neutral/enemy attestation from Josephus (he may be reporting that the disciples at least believed Jesus appeared to them in Antiquities 18) \n f) The Principle of Dissimilarity applies to the notion of a man/Messiah resurrecting from the dead before the end of time was contrary to Jewish belief and therefore reduces the odds it was \"made up.\" \n g) Principle of Embarrassment applies to the evidence that some disciples at the first instance did not believe but had doubts that Jesus was alive (Matthew 28:17, Luke 24:36-38, John 20:24-25).\n \n Persecution and death of some disciples: \n \n a) Early attestation from the Book of Acts (ch. 12 - death of James brother of John) \n b) Early attestation from Clement of Rome (1 Clement 5 - ca. 95AD) \n c) Attestation from Ignatius (Letter to the Smyrnaeans 3:2-3 - ca. 110AD) \n d) Attestation from Polycarp (Letter to the Philippians 9 - ca. 110AD) \n e) Attestation from Dionysius of Corinth (ca. 170AD - quoted by Eusebius Ecclesiastical History 2:25:8) \n f) Attestation from Tertullian (Scorpiace 15 - ca. 200AD) \n g) Attestation from Origen (Contra Celsum 2:56,77 - ca. 230-250AD)\n \n Atheist NT scholar Gerd Ludemann said, \"It may be taken as historically certain that Peter and the disciples had experiences after Jesus' death in which Jesus appeared to them as the risen Christ.\" Gerd Ludemann, What Really Happened to Jesus? A Historical Approach to the Resurrection, (1995) p. 80. (It should be noted Ludemann believes these were visions) \n \n Paul, an enemy and persecutor of the church (Acts 8:3, 1 Cor. 15:9, Gal. 1:13) was transformed and became a prolific apostle because of his belief that a risen Jesus appeared to him. He was persecuted and reported as martyred. \n \n Appearances of Jesus to Paul and his conversion: \n \n a) Early, multiple and eyewitness attestation from Paul himself (1 Cor. 15, Gal. 1, Phil. 3) \n b) Multiple and early attestation from the Book of Acts (ch. 9, 22, 26)\n \n Paul&#8217;s suffering/martyrdom: \n \n a) Early, multiple and eyewitness attestation from Paul for his suffering (2 Cor. 11, Phil. 1) \n b) Multiple and early attestation from Book of Acts (ch. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23) \n c) Early attestation from Clement of Rome (1 Clement 5) \n d) Attestation from Polycarp (Letter to the Philippians 9:2) \n e) Attestation from Tertullian (Scorpiace 15 and also quoted by Eusebius in Ecclesiastical History 2:25:8) \n f) Attestation from Dionysius of Corinth (c. 170AD - quoted by Eusebius in EH 2:25:8) \n g) Attestation from Origen (Commentary on Genesis as quoted by Eusebius in EH 3:1)\n \n James, brother of Jesus (Mark 6:3) and skeptic of His claims before the appearance of Jesus to him, was transformed and became a leader in the Church in Jerusalem. He was reported as martyred. \n \n a) Principle of Embarrassment applies as Jesus' own family and brother James were described as skeptical prior to appearances (multiply attested - Matthew 13:57, Mark 3:21, 6:3-4, John 7:4-5) \n b) Jesus appeared alive to James after His death (early and enemy attestation from Paul - 1 Cor. 15:7) \n c) James is later described as an apostle by Paul (Gal 1:19) and leader in the early church in Jerusalem (Gal 2:9,12 and Acts 15) \n d) Suffered and martyred - Enemy/neutral attestation from Josephus (ca. 96AD - Antiquities 20), further multiple attestation from Hegesippus (ca. 160AD - as quoted by Eusebius in Ecclesiastical History 2:23), and Clement of Alexandria (ca. 180-200AD as quoted by Eusebius in EH 2:1).\n \n Compliments: Goose - Debating Christianity.com",

   "God raising Jesus and appearing alive explains: \n \n\n \n \n How does this relate to the article concerning research observation of methods used by Middle Eastern people in the transmission of oral stories?\n \n \n1. Why the tomb was found empty. This is quite simple. If Jesus was still found in the tomb He was obviously still dead. \n 2. It explains the disciples sincere belief Jesus appeared to them. It further explains why the disciples turned from abandoning Jesus from fear before the crucifixion to proclaiming that Jesus was the Christ and that He rose from the dead despite persecution and even possibly death after the crucifixion. \n 3. The conversion of a church enemy Paul and his subsequent prolific career as an apostle despite hardships, persecutions and ultimately martyrdom. \n 4. The conversion of James, a sceptic prior to the crucifixion, and subsequent role as a leader in the church. \n\n \n \n We don't know for sure the tomb was empty or if there really was a tomb, but let's say there was and it was empty. \n \n Jesus was convicted of a terrible crime, the punishment for which was to be both cruel and lengthy, but he dies earlier than expected. Jewish law forbids a dead body hanging overnight, but it is the passover and by the time the body is released it is almost sunset. There is no time to prepare the body (even the wicked were given the chance to redeem themselves after death) Jewish law did permit a temporary holding place for instances such as this.\n \n The Temple is required to perform burial rites for those who have no relatives to do so. Since the Apostles were hiding, the temple would have believed it their responsibility. Jesus as a wicked person convicted of a capital offense would not be permitted to be buried near righteous people and would have been buried in a criminals graveyard separated for that purpose (all criminals, not just Jesus)\n \n This is a much more likely explanation, than he was raised from the dead, something that requires the assumption of God in order to be a consideration.\n \n \n \nA legend (or fable, fiction or fraud) that Jesus rose from the dead would not adequately account for: \n \n 1. The disciples sincere belief that Jesus appeared to them. People do not subject themselves to persecution or death for what they know to be lies and legends. \n 2. The conversion of Paul, an enemy. \n 3. The conversion of James, a skeptic. \n\n \n \n 1) Who said they all thought it was a lie? Of course they thought it was true, don't you? If this is evidence to validate a religion there are about 2000 or so that qualify.\n \n 2) I honestly I have never heard a good objection to this, but at the same time doesn't mean much. Crooks become Cops, Democrats become Republicans, Christians become Athiests and vice versa. Doing so doesn't validate the new except for the person making the change. \n \n 3) Same as 2\n \n \n \n \nHere are 5 \"facts\" that should pass enough of the listed criteria to be considered probable: \n\n \n What happened to the listed criteria?\n \n \n \nFACT 1. Jesus crucifixion and death \n \n a) Early (and enemy) attestation from the Apostle Paul - (1 Thessalonians 5:9-10, 2:15; 1 Corinthians 1:23, 2:2 and early creedal passages in 1 Corinthians 15:3 - ca. 50-60AD) \n\n \n Paul was not an enemy while instructing the Churches\n \n \nb) Multiple attestation in all four Gospels and the Book of Acts (ca. 70-100AD) \n\n \n OK\n \n \nc) Enemy/neutral attestation from Jewish historian Josephus (Antiquities 18:64 - 96AD) \n\n \n Not an enemy, not nuetral and not real.\n \n \nd) Enemy/neutral attestation from Roman historian Tacitus (Annals 15:44 - ca. 115AD) \n\n \n Possibly real, but again doesn't say anything significant. Not quoted by Christian writers, word for Christian was changed from another word, but could have been misspelling), Unexplained errors so let's call this a maybe.\n \n \ne) Enemy/neutral attestation from Greek satirical writer Lucian (The Death of Peregrine, 11-13 - ca. 150AD) \n\n \n Again doesn't say anything that is significant considering it is written almost 100 years after Jesus's death\n \n \nf) Enemy/neutral attestation from Talmud (Sanhedrin 43a - ca. 200AD) \n\n \n Not even a chance on your best day would this be considered evidence for Jesus.\n \n \ng) Principle of Embarrassment applies to the humiliating suffering and death of a supposed Messiah and the Son of God (as well as Principle of Dissimilarity from Jewish anticipation of a military type leader in the Messiah). \n\n \n Maybe the author isn't fimiliar with Christianity. The fact that the Son of God died a horrible death as foretold in scripture to wash away your sins was then and is still used today. \n \n What is the Principle of Dissimilarity? \n \n \nAtheist NT scholar Gerd L&#65533;demann acknowledged, \"Jesus' death as a consequence of crucifixion is indisputable.\" Gerd Ludemann, The Resurrection of Christ, pg 50. \n\n \n I don't know about indisputable, but most people don't disagree\n \n \n\n The critical NT scholar and Jesus Seminar co-founder John Dominic Crossan wrote, \"Jesus&#65533; death by execution under Pontius Pilate is as sure as anything historical can ever be. For, if no follower of Jesus had written anything for one hundred years after his crucifixion, we would still know about him from two authors not among his supporters.

Third, rather than being stopped, the movement continued to spread. There remain, therefore, these three: movement, execution, continuation. But the greatest of these is continuation.\" John Dominic Crossan, The Essential Jesus, p. 7. \n\n \n \n I didn't read whatever this is from, but why does he first say Jesus was killed because of the movement and this is as sure as anything in history, and two pages later (odd) now say presumably?\n \n I addressed the author references already.\n \n \nJohn P. Meier wrote, \"For two obvious reasons practically no one would deny the fact that Jesus was executed by crucifixion: (1) This central event is reported or alluded to not only by the vast majority of NT authors, but also by Josephus and Tacitus...(2) Such an embarrassing event created a major obstacle to converting Jews and Gentiles alike...that the Church struggled to overcome...\" (John P.

Pilate would have been involved in something like that. Big no no robbing graves. \n \n \n \ne) We have no record of Jesus&#65533; corpse being produced only accusations that the disciples stole the body. \n\n \n They waited what 50 days before they said anything. The Temple is going to commit a huge sin and parade a decomposing corpse around town that would have been completely unrecognizable. \n \n \nf) Setting the stage for the empty tomb was the honourable burial of Jesus by Joseph of Arimethea (another fact we could admit as number 6 - but won't as it isn't really necessary to do so). It is attested by all four Gospels. As well Paul mentions the burial of Jesus(1 Cor 15).

This would have been offensive to the disciples and as such is unlikely to be a fabrication. \n \n\n\n \n I have already addressed most of this but isn't JofA referred to as a disciple and I doubt it would have been offensive since they didn't plan on doing it and does nobody care about Nicodemus. This paragraph is just all kinds of wrong\n \n Preaching was a pretty lucrative business considering what jobs they had prior. There was some harassment, but for the most part the persecution wasn't immediate and wasn't constant. To be a victim was a badge of honor, for many the best thing that could happen to them in their mind.",

   "So you want us to believe that the corrupt Jewish leaders (as Jesus documented time and again), are suddenly going to start following the law when they just violated it with their kangaroo court?\n\n \n This kangaroo court has only the Gospels to say what happened, who by the way even if Mark, Matthew, Luke and John were the authors were not present. Maybe, just maybe the Jews honestly thought he was guilty of Blasphemy, but it is much easier to assume religious leaders are corrupt and would willingly lie and plot to murder an innocent man in the name of God. What does that say about your views on religious integrity?\n \n \n \nAnd that the Romans were now knowingly guarding an empty tomb?\n\n \n Which is oddly missing from Peter's account (written by Mark) and Luke's and John's. Which would have the Romans admitting they fell asleep on duty, which would have been a capital offense. Does it seem odd that if true Pilate and Jews would have first hand verifiable evidence that the son of God had been resurrected. Pilate and the Sanhedrin could have been there within hours to investigate. The Gospels would have us believe that Pilate was not convinced of Jesus' guilt, still followed the letter of the law. Getting confirmation of Jesus' death before taking the word of a respected council member of Jesus' death. There is no mention of guards by Mark, Luke or John only Matthew. Again something to ponder, the significant number of similarities the synoptic posses is rivaled only by what they don't share.\n \n \n \nAnd that the recorded wrapping of the body in linen and placing it in the tomb of Joseph of Arimethea was a lie?\n\n \n I said Joseph did indeed place the body in a tomb, but that would have been temporary. The women went to the tomb for what purpose? To perform burial rites. They saw the body placed in the tomb, why would they go to perform the burial rites if it had been done? Why did they not assist Joseph? How would Joseph had enough time before Passover began and no work is to be done?He didn't have the time and his placement in the tomb was not permanent. That is why the women didn't help and that is why they came back to do so\n \n \nAnd so on and so on?\n \n Sorry, but it's easier to believe the Biblical accounts than all these other far out AND UNSUBSTANTIATED theories.\n\n \n Why Christianity and not Bhuddism? \n \n \nBecause that's what you are engaging in - trying to establish a whole host of unsubstantiated theories.\n \n Let's see. According to Bible deniers...\n \n Matthew was lying or deceived. Or whoever wrote that was lying and deceived. Same with Peter, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, James, Jude, and pretty much everyone in the New Testament. THEY ALL GOT IT WRONG!\n \n Sorry, that requires a much greater faith than what I can muster.\n\n \n How many people follow televangelists or get swindled on Ponzi scams? How often is history written in a light favorable to the writers? Do you deny that honest people are often mislead sometimes by people who themselves believe? Do you deny that the church forged and altered scripture? That they intentionally destroyed opposing viewpoints? You have to admit these things happen, but find it unreasonable to think these actions had any kind of lasting effect. That somehow all the bad was kept apart from the good. Keep your belief your probably a better person for it, but do me a favor and keep that beleif in your life.",

   "Jesus Must Be God \n \n John 1:23 quotes Isaiah 40:3 as saying John the Baptist was to prepare the way of the LORD (Jehovah). John prepared the way before Jesus so Jesus must be LORD (Jehovah). \n \n In Isaiah 44:8 God is the only Rock. Psalm 18:31 says, \"Who is the Rock except our God\"? I Corinthians 10:4, identifies Jesus as the Rock. Jesus must also then be God the Rock. \n \n Isaiah 44:24 says that God (Jehovah) is the one who has made all things. Colossians 1:16, speaking of Christ, says that \"all things were created by Him and for him\". Jesus must therefore be Jehovah God. \n \n In Jeremiah 10:10 it says \"the LORD (Jehovah) is the true God\". I John 5:20 states that Jesus is the \"true God\". Jesus must be the true God.\n \n Isaiah 43:10,11 says that \"I, even I, am the LORD; and there is no savior besides Me. Jesus is the Savior (Matthew 1:21, Titus 2:13; 2 Peter 1:1, etc., etc.). Jesus must be God the Savior.\n \n Jehovah knows all things (Psalm 147:5). Jesus knows \"all things.\" (John 16:30). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah alone is the only one who knows the hearts of all men. (1 Kings 8:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus knows the hearts of all men. (John 2:24-25; Rev. 2:18, 23). Jesus must be God.\n \n Jehovah is our sanctifier. (Exodus 31:13). Jesus sanctifies us (Hebrews 10:10). Only God is the sanctifier of men. Jesus must be God.\n \n Jehovah is our peace (Judges 6:23). Jesus is our peace (Ephesians 2:14). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is our righteousness (Jeremiah 23:6). Jesus is our righteousness. (Romans 3:21-22; 1 Corinthians 1:30). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be delivered / snatched out of His hand (Deuteronomy 32:39). Jesus is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be \"snatched\" out of His hand. (John 10:28). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah's voice is \"like the roar of rushing waters\" (Ezekiel 43:2). Jesus' \"voice was like the sound of rushing waters\" (Revelation 1:15). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is present everywhere.(Proverbs 15:3; Jeremiah 23:24; I Kings 8:27); Jesus is omnipresent (John 1:48; Matthew 18:20; 28:20). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah's nature does not change (Malachi 3:6). Jesus' nature does not change. (Hebrews 13:8). \n \n Jehovah is the only God we are to \"serve\"(2 Kings 17:35); Jesus (identified as the Creator in Colossians 1:16-17) is to be served (Colossians 3:24). Jesus must be Jehovah. \n \n Jehovah the Lord is to be set apart as holy (Isaiah 8:12b-13). Jesus, as Lord, is to be set apart as holy (1 Peter 3:14b-15a).\n \n Jehovah's glory is not to be given to another (Isaiah 42:8). Jesus shares Jehovah's glory (John 17:5). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n God's name is Jehovah (or Yahweh-YHWH - Isaiah 42:8). Jesus has Jehovah's name (John 17:11; John 16:14-15). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the \"mighty God\" (Jeremiah 32:17-18; Isaiah 10:20-21). Jesus is the \"mighty God\" \n (Isaiah 9:6) who is \"Almighty\" (Revelation 1:7-8).\n \n Jehovah is \"the first and the last\" (Isaiah 44:6; 48:12). Jesus is the \"first and the last\" (Revelation 1:17-18; 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the \"Alpha and the Omega\" (Revelation 1:8; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus is the \"Alpha and the Omega\" (Revelation 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah's title is \"the Holy One\" (Isaiah 47:4). Jesus is \"the Holy One\" (Acts 3:14; John 6:69). Jesus must be Jehovah, the Holy One.\n \n Jehovah is the \"stumbling stone\" of Israel (Isaiah 8:13-15). Jesus is the \"stumbling stone\" of Israel (1 Peter 2:6-8). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the great Judge who gives life to whom he wishes and who renders to each man \"according\" to his \"deeds\" (Psalm 98:9; Deuteronomy 32:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus is the only judge who gives life to whom he wishes and renders to each man \"according\" to his \"deeds\" (John 5:21-22; Revelation 2:18, 23). Jesus must be Jehovah. \n \n Jehovah is the great \"shepherd\" who leads his people to \"the spring of the water of life\" (Psalm 23:1-2; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus as the \"shepherd\" of His people, leads them \"to springs of the water of life\" (John 10:11-18; Revelation 7:17). THERE IS ONLY ONE SHEPHERD --John 10:16.\n \n Jehovah is \"Lord of Lords\" (Deuteronomy 10:17). Jesus is \"Lord of Lords.\" (Revelation 17:14; 19:16). The Father is Lord of all (Matthew 11:25; Acts 17:24). Jesus is \"Lord of all.\" (Acts 10:36). THERE IS ONLY ONE LORD (Jude 4) .\n \n Jehovah created the universe (Psalm 102:25-27). Jesus created the universe (John 1:3; Colossians 1:15-19; Hebrews 1:10-12). THERE IS ONLY ONE CREATOR. (Isaiah 44:24). Jesus must be Jehovah. \n \n witforjesus.org, etc.",
