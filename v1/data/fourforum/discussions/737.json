   "People seem to think new age as hippie loving pagans.... Well I don't know when pagans were hippie loving unless they were hippies. But anyway New Age just refers to unorthodox beliefs. It is like taking a belief and changing it to modern society. If you peer through the new age section you will see everything from the belief in vampirism to the belief in Satanic worship to your common witchcraft/ wicca beliefs and even to your new age christian beliefs. \n \n So what is your opinion with the new age beliefs? Do you think this is a good thing to our society or another religius movement that should be destoried?\n \n In my opinion I see nothing wrong with it. I have found that many who follow new age beliefs either in a christian way or a satanic way or even a pagan way seem to be more open to other beliefs. Maybe this is the evolution of religion. Yet people do stay orthodox in their beliefs.",

Do you think this is a good thing to our society or another religius movement that should be destoried?\"\n \n - Personally I don't think worshiping the devil has alot to contribute to scociety so I don't really veiw it as a \"good thing\". No religious practice should ever be destoryed. No one has the right to do that, unless the maintaing of that practice is violating the rights of others and the religion is purely based on that. For example if there was religion where its sole purpose was to buy weapons. Go into school and shoot people.... Well something needs to be done about it.\n \n \"Maybe this is the evolution of religion.\"\n \n - Nah, we are still where we were 100's of years ago. :) \n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "Well it depends on the religion or the new age beliefs. Like a lot of new age beliefs take the idea of the ancient ways to a whole new light. I don't agree with a lot of it... But I don't think there is anything wrong with it. \n \n As for devil worship... It depends on your opinion of what kind of Satanism it is... There is Anton Satanic ways and there is the Lucifer worshiping ways. Neither are good or are they bad. Their beliefs are diffrent from what Christians impose Satan/ Lucifer as. (Well through my research that it).\n \n Its really a matter of opinion on this. A lot of people see it as wrong because it is unorthodox. Others see it as a new evolution of life. People look at new age theories which there is almost hundreds of paths as away of enlightenment.",

   "people have a very misconstrued view of satanism and witchcraft. i will clairify.\n \n satanism:\n satanism is hard to digest because of how much the media has twisted it around. satanism is much like the way they worshiped god in the ancient times. how is this? they sacrifice animals, but to the devil. why the devil? well, they don't see the devil is this bad guy. they see god as this bad guy. when lucifer wanted to be like god, and god punished lucifer to eternal damnation, the satanists saw this as cruel and unusual punishment. they worship lucifer becuase they thought god was afraid of his power and that god is really the 'evil' side. they actually follow the bible's ancient practices more than christians.\n \n wicca/witchcraft:\n the correct term is 'wicca'. me, knowing a wiccan, knows a lot fo this. this is possibly the most harmless religion out there. no suicide bombers, no jahova's witnesses, no 'poke your eye out dradels'; nothing. this religion is based around nature. they worship nature. plain as that. media, again, has distorted society's outlook on this religion. but pentagrams are evil. not exactly, just like the satanists the pentagram's points stand for the 4 elements; fire, water, wind, earth; and their god or goddess. in wicca, it is goddess. it would be wrong to say that these religious people could do wrong. of course, they can, but in their belief, everything comes back three fold. so why would they do bad?\n \n if you have anymore questions, i would be happy to answer. i left some out probably.",

   "Wicca is a modern term for modern witchcraft. Wicca or Wiccan hd another meaning but it sliped my mind. I practice witchcraft actually and from my first hand knowledge from studying both wicca and other forms of witchcraft I have found that wicca to be a weak religion based magick. Wicca teaches to much that there is good and evil and very little on the princples of magick. Magick is a form of energy created by negative and positive streams. The only actually evil or good in magick is created by man. Regardless of what kind of magick you use if you use to much of it you will get harmed wether it is for \"good\" or for \"evil\".\n \n I know a lot on magick not because I read but because I actually practice it.\n \n As for the worship Satan... Well it depends on the reasonings behind Satanic worship. Satan can just be a symbol for rebelion... Or it is a symbol for a new world. Lucifer was jelius angel who fell because he hated what God was doing. He wanted more love then God was offering. Lucifers main agenda was to be higher then God. He thought he could do more then God. So many who worship Lucifer either fear him or see him as an idol. Not an evil idol but someone they respect.",

   "i found out that there is a difference between wicca and witchcraft. wicca is what i stated before. witchcraft is what most think satanism is.\n \n this form of witchcraft is befuddling. i recently met a person who followed this. this is the 'ultimate' crime against 'god'. one is a witch if, supposedly, they know god exists, but turn their back on him/her. these witches are extremely smart and perfect the art of language. they can manipulate most people. aside from perfecting language, they know science very well. this is 'magic'. they do NOT worship the devil, i repeat, do NOT worship the devil. they worship no one. they only shun 'god'.\n \n back to the 'perfecting language'. witches learn how to think and speak backwards. why? because our brain works backwards. look at it like this; when we think of a moment, we remember it backwards. when we think of a word, we remember it backwards. this is how we process information whether we know it or not. the witches use this against us; much like when 'stairway to heaven' plays and, when played backwards, the message is, over and over: 'satan, sweet satan.'\n \n somethign else, does anyone know what the peace symbol actually is or where it came from? well, this will become of shock to you, but the peace symbol is a witch symbol. i will explain.\n when a witch is enducted, they preform a ceremony in which they take an upside-down, wodden cross and break the arms downward, thus, creating, what we believe, the peace symbol. this is not a peace symbol.\n \n any questions would be gladly answered, if i can. if not, i will talk to this person i met.",

What do you mean that I remember things backwards, even if I don't know it?\n \n I think this is a pile based on the fact that the image projected on the retina is reversed and inverted by the lens in our eye, but we \"don't know it.\"\n \n Actually, experiments have been performed where the subjects wore glasses that reversed and inverted the image before it reached the eye. At first it was disorienting, but after a time the subjects found that they perceived the world normally again. They then experienced the same disorientation when they removed the glasses - everything seemed reversed and inverted.\n \n I think that you should take a salt shaker with you when you talk to your friend.
