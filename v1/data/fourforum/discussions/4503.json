   "1. People please don't argue with Hunter about what the ten commandments are because he is right. His ten commandments are (albeit somewhat simplified and abridged) basically the ten commandments.\n \n 2. Hunter, you're answers to my previous question point to the very definition of what a fundamentalist is. To shed light on this, here is an article I wrote for my class, \"Fundamentalism and the Future of Religion:\"\n \n \nReligion and Fundamentalism\n \n I sat back today watching a documentary about the horrific events that have launched fundamentalism from the back of the newspapers, into the forefront of American lives. Nine-eleven was a catastrophic day when America was attacked on our own soil on a massive scale not seen since WWII. It woke all of us up to the dangers of not only radical Islamic fundamentalism, but the dangers of fundamentalism in general.\n It is easy, however, to simply throw terms around. We must go further and ask ourselves what we are talking about; what is a religion, what is fundamentalism, and what is their relationship with each other?\n Religion must have some central components to it. To create a laundry list of necessary criteria we must begin by saying that it engenders some sense of community. When you are a member of a religion, you are not alone. The next major component to a religion is that it has some systematic belief that is centered on \"the sacred.\" That is to say, they believe in something more than themselves and that there is a correct way, as well as an incorrect way, to live one's life.\n The three main elements described above (specific sense of community, belief in the sacred, and a systematic belief or doctrine) describe a lot about religion, but they cannot tell us the full story. Religion's mythos, or stories that identify themselves, also tells us a lot about religions. Since the written word was invented, religions began to write down their mythos' in what is now commonly known as scripture. \n Another fascinating portion of religion that cannot be ignored is the common experience. Ranged from the mystic medicine man of the Navajo Tribes to the vision of St Mary, all religions have some form of \"sacred imagery\" or some way to travel to the beyond world. This mythos and \"sacred imagery\" is often made \"real\" through the use of rituals which often try to close the infinite gap between the sacred and the individual through a communal practice.\n Rituals are very diverse; from the Native American sweat lodges to the Roman Catholic Eucharist, the common cardinal importance of the ritual is to bring members of the community together to affirm their beliefs and connect to the sacred. By closing the infinite gap it helps the individual to relate with the sacred. By communally reaffirming one's belief in the common creed through ritual, not only is the community being brought together, a common narrative being created, but also we see the individual being empowered through their religion.\n What has this to do with the violence that has been done in \"God's (or Allah's) name\"? What is fundamentalism? The preliminary definition given to us by Ian Lustig is a terrific place to start, yet we must keep in mind that it misses the retreatist fundamentalists. Maybe a more moderate version of his definition, coupled with Jessica Stern's observation is needed. Something along the lines of, \"A religious structure where its adherents regard its tenets as uncompromisable and have direct transcendental imperatives that may involve political action oriented toward the rapid and comprehensive reconstruction of society, or a radical and comprehensive escape from society aimed at living in a world that never truly existed.\"\n This definition, of course, assumes that fundamentalism is a subset of religion. In essence, one could say that all fundamentalist systems are religions, but not all religions are fundamentalist systems. As both Kimball and Armstrong point out, most of the world's major religions are weathered, and moderated. They have survived for a time and as such have come to understand and recognize other religions as an acceptable fact to life. \n In my conversation with Catholics, for example, they often say that Catholicism is the best way to get to God, yet they will quickly acknowledge that other religions have \"rays\" of truth in them. It affirms their beliefs, but accepts other interpretations as having some grace or truth value in them. \n Fundamentalist systems stand in opposition to this tolerance of diversity. A fundamentalist would argue that there is only one truth and that they know this truth, all other religions; therefore, are wrong on some, most, or all of their beliefs. They would then go further to say that, unless you believe in what they believe that you will not be saved. I am thankful that most fundamentalists, at least in America , tend not to take this to violent ends. Unfortunately there are those in the Middle East who have no problem with waging a Holy War, or as they call it, Jihad, on those infidels who are either slandering their religion or who believe in a different religion. \n In essence the major item that divides fundamental beliefs from the more \"mainstream\" religious beliefs is when they become hard in their tenets and view them as not only uncompromisable, but something that should be protected and kept \"pure.\" Now, I don't have a problem if they do this locked away in their own communities (e.g. the Amish) but when they take radical or violent action, then it is time to understand the threat that we face. \n \n \n \n 3. As a philosopher I am duty bound to ask: \n \n \n1. Bible inerrancy: It is my belief that every word in the Bible is the inspired word of God. Many different translations from the original texts could pose minor problems. Some people claim that there are books which were left out of the Bible for some reason. Be that as it may be, I still accept the the King James version of the Bible to be correct and satisfactory to God and man.\n \n 2. The divinity of Jesus: I accept this without question.\n \n 3. The virgin birth: I accept this without question.\n \n \n \n How do you know this? How do you know that you should believe in 1 and why should you believe in 2 or three \"without question?\"",

His ten commandments are (albeit somewhat simplified and abridged) basically the ten commandments.\n \n 2. Hunter, you're answers to my previous question point to the very definition of what a fundamentalist is. To shed light on this, here is an article I wrote for my class, \"Fundamentalism and the Future of Religion:\"\n \n \n \n 3. As a philosopher I am duty bound to ask: \n \n \n \n How do you know this? How do you know that you should believe in 1 and why should you believe in 2 or three \"without question?\"\n\n \n Thanks for agreeing with me on the truth that I posted concerning The Ten Commandments. That makes you and I both 100% correct.\n \n I believe that the most important thing that a person can do with their time on this earth is to seek the truth about the means to eternal life. Life after death in Heaven with God or eternity in Hell. I believe that a personal relationship with Jesus is the only way to salvation, I am totally convinced of it. Jesus Christ was either a poached egg or God himself. Jesus claimed to be God, I chose to believe him. Many others disagree with my beliefs and that is their right. One of the greatest gifts that God gave to mankind is free will. Use it wisely as your very soul depends on what you do with your use of free will.\n \n Why don't you actually read the New Testament with an open mind and see for yourself that Jesus spoke the absolute truth about everything. No man in the history of the world has had a greater impact on humanity than Jesus. I do not understand how that fact can be ignored. It is the truth and cannot be denied. Eleven of the twelve original deciples died because of their belief in Jesus. They were all sane men of greatly varied backgrounds. None of them would have chosen to die for a rumor. I know that I wouldn't, but I would die for my Lord. A man is to die, and then the judgement of Christ. That is is it in a nut shell. Salvation is not a complicated issue, there is no grey area here. You either believe in Christ and go to Heaven or not. The choice is yours and yours alone. Christianity excludes no body. All are welcome. It is my hope and prayer that everyone at least keep an open mind and give Jesus a chance to save you from yourself and eternity in Hell.",

Isn't it amazing how many people claim to have read the Bible and who claim to base their faith on the Bible who aren't aware of what it says and are too lazy to find out?\n \nI mean no disrespect to you, but I really don't understand why you are fighting this losing battle with me.\n\n Yes you do. You have been full of insult from the beginning and you do mean disrespect. Just look how you declare yourself to be the winner and then follow up with the thought that you should possibly research the matter.\n \nPerhaps I should do some research on the origin of the commandments as I posted them. Anyway, let us agree to disagree.\n\n If you want. I doubt that you will actually research it. Moreover, when you find out that I am correct I doubt that you have the integrity to admit it. Just so we are clear on what I am asserting so you don't twist it to make yourself appear correct as you tend to do - I am asserting the the 10 commandments that Duo and I listed are the ONLY commandments that are identified IN THE BIBLE as the 10 commandments. I am not saying that the other commandments that you listed did not come from the Bible. I am saying that the Bible does not identify them as the 10 commandments that Moses brought down from the mountain.\n \n1. Bible inerrancy:\n \n 2. The divinity of Jesus:\n \n 3. The virgin birth:\n \n 4. The belief that Jesus died to redeem man:\n \n 5. An expectation of the Second Coming, or physical return of Jesus Christ to initiate his 1000-year rule on earth:\n\n Congratulations, Hunter. You have just accepted the 5 primary tenets of fundamentalism. So I guess that makes you a fundamentalist.\n \nPeople please don't argue with Hunter about what the ten commandments are because he is right. His ten commandments are (albeit somewhat simplified and abridged) basically the ten commandments.\n\n So you don't read the Bible either? What Hunter listed and what you agree with are 10 commandments. They do come from the Bible. But that is not the point. They are not THE 10 Commandments that are identified as such in the Bible. The problem is that on the one hand many so called christians claim to follow the doctrine of \"sola scriptura.\" And then they accept traditions that are not stated in the Bible. The commandments that you and Hunter accept are not the commandments that Moses was given on the mountain and that the Bible identifies as THE 10 Commandments. You and Hunter are using a modified version of the traditional 10 commandments of the Roman Catholic Church.",

Which is the point you are making by my over generalization of the topic :).\n\n \n I was raised in that era, with those values, and there's no doubt they were generally effective in producing responsible citizens. A big difference between then and now was the background of parents and grandparents from those eras. A majority experienced the major economic depression of 1929, which continued right up to WW2. Even when prosperity arrived with and following WW2, personal responsibility was still important to those generations and reflected by empathsis on personal savings, limited or no debt and close, personal family relationships. Those days and values have generally disappeared.\n \n I now watch a majority of parents put themselves in financial positions that would give me high anxiety with every waking breath and allow little or no sleep. That's been the norm for the past couple of generations, with each generation sinking deeper and deeper in their pursuit of free personal time and unaffordable material acquisition.

   "I was raised in that era, with those values, and there's no doubt they were generally effective in producing responsible citizens. A big difference between then and now was the background of parents and grandparents from those eras. A majority experienced the major economic depression of 1929, which continued right up to WW2. Even when prosperity arrived with and following WW2, personal responsibility was still important to those generations and reflected by empathsis on personal savings, limited or no debt and close, personal family relationships. Those days and values have generally disappeared.\n \n I now watch a majority of parents put themselves in financial positions that would give me high anxiety with every waking breath and allow little or no sleep.

   "My grandfather had a problem with the local KKK back in the 20's. He was a farmer and was postmaster in the small community. One day the head of the local clan asked my grandfather to join. When my grandfather refused the man told my grandfather he \"was either with us or against us, and those that are against us can have their barns burn down and their stock die\". My grandfather replied that if his barn burned or his stock died or any harm came to any of his family, he would hold him personally responsible and would deal with him, and that he would tell his brothers of their conversation. For months after that my grandfather plowed with his rifle across the plow and his pistol in the bib of his overalls. My father recalled he and his brothers sleeping with loaded rifles in the room. My grandfather's barn was in good shape and his stock were healthy when he sold the farm years later.\n Dono",

   "You know, everyone is keeps talking about the moral character of General Nathan Bedford Forrest, and his purposes for founding the Ku Klux Klan. Well, he wasn't even there when it started. The original KKK was meant to be a secret organization so that some kids could have some fun being secretive. It was started to rebel against the Reconstruction, and became a huge group extremely quickly. There was no real organization at all until they had representatives meet, and that was when General Forrest was appointed Imperial/Grand Wizard. He disbanded it, yes, in 1869 after it proved uncontrollable, and unnecessarilay violent. No, I do not know if I spelled unnecessarily right, so don't ask. emoticon_wow\n\n \n This is all true, but there is a separate thread about Forrest here in this forum where he's been discussed at length.",
