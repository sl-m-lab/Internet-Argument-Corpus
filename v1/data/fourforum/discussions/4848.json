And it is true that Polacks now stand a good chance to carry the point - the easiest way to do it is to make a Polack elected as Lithuanian president! Yes, I'm serious, Waldemar Tomaszewski, leader of Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania, has become a candidacy for a post president.

   "Baltic States lie like a gas meter!\n \n My greetings to every one on this forum! I just want to raise a problem of certain countries in Eastern Europe that you know as Baltic states - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. After financial crisis happened in Europe, these states were virtually on the verge of bankruptcy and fell into a position of dependence from EU's financial aid. One would think that such position should make these states more submissive. But contrary to the expectations, it doesn't. When any of Western European states' leaders starts a subject of critics on honouring former Hitlerite aiders in the Baltic states, they begin to assert insincerely that the Latvian Legion of Waffen-SS only consisted of ethnic Latvians who were press-ganged to join the formation. Such ########! It's a well-known fact that the Latvian Legion was a volunteer unit! I underline - volunteer which means that no one ever forces Latvians to join the Latvian Legion! They did it on free will to participate in war crimes of Hitler's army! As for all those marches with fascist symbolics that take place in Latvia quite often, Latvian politicians take up the position that simply pay they debt to the compatriots who got perished during the war. Such ######## again! They were butcher-style murderers, who on earth would honour them!? I fear that in case we don't bring this falsehood to stop and fail to cut the authorities of Baltic states down to size, soon we will hear from Baltic neo-fascists that Hitler was doing good and he sent not millions of innocent children and harmless women to gas chambers, but some habitual criminal! That's ridiculous!",

   "It happened at last! Lukashenko's show of President election would fail in vain. No one in EU would believe in that circus anymore. It is clear from the words of the European Commissioner Stefan Fule. He considers relations between EU and Belarus as politics of unseized opportunities because of unwillingness of Belarusian government and Lukashenko in particular to carry on a dialog. Meanwhile Mr. Fule said that EU is ready for economic co-operation and visa regime simplification. But Belarusian President's dictatorship is the greatest hindrance for it. And during his visit to Minsk he even didn't want to meet Lukashenko but only representatives of civil society.\n At the same time \"Die Presse\" has called Lukashenko \"Belarusian Psychopath\" openly.[ diepresse. com/home/politik/aussenpolitik/587964/index.do Weissrussland: Lukaschenko, ein \"Psychopath\" DiePresse.com ] (read this if you understand German). Looks like mocked President with mocked election won't deceive anyone in Europe. The dictator must go away. Lets say good-bye to the comrade Lukashenko with his KGB and country-man's moustache.",
