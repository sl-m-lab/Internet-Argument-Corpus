   "Well, this would be comical if it weren't so sad...\n \n From the list on the web site, 2nd from top:\n EPA Proposes Adding 16 Chemicals Reasonably Anticipated to be Human Carcinogens to TRI Chemical List...These 16 chemicals have been classified by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) in their Report on Carcinogens (RoC) as \"reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.\" EPA believes that the 16 chemicals being proposed for addition meet the statutory listing criteria because they can reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans. EPA also expects that these chemicals will meet or exceed the TRI reporting thresholds resulting in reports being filed....\n \n Included is: Vinyl Fluoride (I'm partial to the 'fluorides' :p )\n So, I do a quick search to find out what Vinyl Fluoride is and where it can be found and - low and behold - I find this:DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 79-102 ....WRITTEN IN 1978!!!\n \n ..stating this: \n 'Vinyl chloride is regulated by OSHA as a demonstrated carcinogen in humans with an occupational exposure limit of 1 ppm. Recent evidence for vinyl bromide and vinylidene chloride demonstrates a pattern of tumor induction in animals similar to that of vinyl chloride, including angiosarcomas at low exposure levels. Safe levels of exposure to carcinogens have not been demonstrated, but decreasing exposure may in general reduce the probability of cancer development. Therefore, as a prudent measure NIOSH and OSHA recommend that occupational exposure to vinyl bromide and vinylidene chloride be reduced to the lowest possible levels. Exposures should be limited to as few employees as possible, and workplace exposure levels should be reduced with engineering and work practice controls.'\n \n ...and this is no surprise:\n Other Vinyl Halides\n \n 'There is a lack of information regarding the carcinogenicity of vinyl fluoride and vinylidene fluoride. However, both have been shown to be mutagenic in bacterial systems.1 This evidence of mutagenicity is cause for concern.'\n \n Jeez, and it only took them 32 years to make it official. emoticon_frazzled",
