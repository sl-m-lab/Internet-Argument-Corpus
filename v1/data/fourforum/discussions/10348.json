   "**\n Quite a while back much was made by darwinist side to the effect that 'horizontal gene transfer' was a phenomenon confined to single-celled organisms, bacteria and protists. But science moves on--\n \n \"Article:\n from SCIENCE NEWS: The Weekly Newsmagazine of Science\n Sept. 1, 2007 vol. 172, No. 9 \n (Page 131)\n \n \"Share alike: Genes from bacteria found in animals\" by P. Barry\n \n Some insects and roundworms pick up DNA from bacteria living within their cells, new research shows.\n \n The DNA transfer occurs in the animals' egg cells, so the genetic modification passes between generations. The mechanism therefore provides an alternative to mutation of existing DNA as a way for the species to acquire new genetic traits.\n \n Gene swapping is ubiquitous among bacteria and other single-celled organisms. Even plants and fungi are known to occasionally adopt a piece of foreign DNA. But scientists thought that multicellular animals picked up genes from bacteria only rarely.\n \n \"Our data are indicating that [DNA transfer] is goinig on all the time,\" says John H. Werren of the University of Rochester in New York, who led the research team.\n \n The discovery challenges the prevailing view of animal evolution, in which genetic information is passed exclusively from parents to offspring. The transfer of DNA from bacteria means that an individual could acquire and pass on genes that it had not inherited.\n \n \"We're sort of on the edge of a transformation in the field\" of animal evolution, comments Laura A. Katz of Smith College in Northampton, Mass. \"These sorts of data allow us to redefine the field to capture this other process going on.\"\n \n Werren's team looked at several species of insects and roundworms infected by a parasitic bacterium called Wolbachia pipientis, which afflicts about 20 percent of insect species as well as many other invertebrates. The bacterium lives inside the animals' cells, including their egg cells, giving it ready access to the chromosomes that are passed on to the animals' offspring.\n \n \"I think that physical access is the key to allowing this [DNA transfer] to happen,\" Werren says. The way in which animals' bodies insulate their eggs and sperm from foreign bacteria is the main barrier to heritable-DNA transfer in animals, he says.\n \n The researchers compared the genetic code of the bacterium with the code of 11 other species: four roundworms, four fruit flies, and three wasps. The team found that all but three of the fruit fly species had segments of the bacterium's genetic code embedded in their DNA. The report appears online and in an upcoming Science.\n \n Some of this transferred DNA is active in the host species' cells, the researchers found, but they didn't determine whether the genes serve a biological function in the host.\n The team also scanned an arcchive of published genomes for 21 other invertebrate species and found bacterial genes in nine of them.\n \n Such bacterial genetic code is routinely ignored during the sequencing of animals' genomes because most scientists have assumed that the foreign DNA is a sign of contamination, Werren says. However, the new research rules out the possibility of contamination, Katz says. \"I think it's a really beautifully done, elegant study.\"\n \n Julie C. Dunning Hotopp, a member of the research team and a scientist at the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Md., says that the mechanism by which DNA leaves the bactyeria and becomes inserted into the host species' chromosomes remains uncertain.\n While in-cell parasites such as W. Pipientis are common among invertebrates, none is known to infect people or other mammals, Werren says.\"\n \n Just FYI.",

   "Big deal, I posted that on this board earlier linked to the original news article in science. Guess you did not read it, old news is no news. But this is an interesting finding is it not. Problem so far is that the integration of the parasites genome in the insects has not yet been shown to have an effect. The parasite is notorious however for altering the behaviors of its hosts to favor its own reproduction, going so far as to alter the sex ratio of the host species. Its a very interesting bug indeed, small genome and a tendency to take some degree of \"control\" over hosts. The system in general may tell us something of the development and evolution of endosymbionts and organelles.",

Once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection.

This is why evolutionary biologists object to being called Darwinists in the sense that you and WW usually try to impose on us, and it is why we insist that there is more to evolution than natural selection or RM&NS alone, and it is why we talk about the Neodarwinian Synthesis and Modern Evolutionary Theory. HGT validates the modern ToE. Modern evolutionary theory incorporates Darwin's version, and lot's more. HGT is part of the \"lots more\". \n \n Some versions of lateral gene transfer have been accepted and studied for many decades, notably versions of conjugation in bacteria. (It wasn't until biologists were able to start sequencing DNA in quantity that we were able to see all the retroviral DNA segments and so forth.)\n \n When someone like Gould (for example) talks about Darwinian evolution, depending on context, they are talking about either 1) the historical early version of the ToE as Darwin envisaged it, 2) the position that natural selection is the dominant process in evolution, or 3) an instance of evolutionary change in which natural selection is inferred to have been by far the most significant process. Evolution has moved well beyond Darwin's initial ideas to include mutations, recombination, and genetic drift, including HGT, in all sorts of combinations with each other and with natural selection.\n \n As Chemist says, once HGT has occurred, the new version with the new genes can easily find itself competing with the old version, providing another way that NS can be involved, but it doesn't have to be. NS is just not all there is to evolution.\n \n I can't wait to see how you are going to misinterpret this next.",

(Gravity as an effect of the curvature of space and time by mass constitute a powerful materialistic explanation that does not require either accidents or fantasies about 'intelligent falling'.)

It's the same genome, just different suites of genes being expressed under different circumstances. Liver cells are genomically identical to nerve cells, but they do not express genes identically.\n \n (3) This means genes are not \"left of of the loop\". They are the loop, just tied together in different ways in different cells, organs and regions of the body.\n \n \n#2 How can evolutionists claim to know which creatures came from which if horizontal gene transfer is now an accepted phenomenon, which means genes can quickly dart across populations, possibly creating new traits and species without these going through the selection process to be created?....... this would completley screw up any notion of which species came from which and there would be no way to construct a phylogenetic tree because ancestry and lines of descent would be anyone's guess, a crapshoot.\n\n \n Because horizontal gene transfer is just one mechanism among many for altering genomes, and a relatively rare one in metazoan organisms.

Many genes, in fact, are involved in the expression of phenotypic traits in different parts of the body.

We have a lot of detail about how genes are expressed during development, and how their expression is controlled. \n \n Suites of genes are involved in tail development in mammals (starting off with the higher numbered -- i.e. posterior -- Hox genes which are one family of master control genes for development along the anterior-posterior axis of all metazoa), and these are pretty much the same for the basic tail architecture in cats and rats (it's subsidiary genes that control minor factors such as the amount and distribution of fur on a mammalian tail). It's certainly not all down to a single gene. They are suppressed in apes, but they are still there, and indeed, apes are sometimes born with vestigial tails (and snakes and whales with vestigial legs).\n \n Biology can explain everything your intelligent designer can, and with less contrived effort.",

   "horizontal gene transfer is just another example of a physiological process that is able to destablize the genome in times of stress and environmental challenges.....in this way, the genome can mutate, DNA can be deleted or inserted or amplified many thousands of times if necessary...the sequences can also be rearranged and recombined with other sequences. Horizontal gene transfer can also occur, which allows genes to jump around from site to site in the genome and even convert other genes to their own sequences. The genome is not a stable thing -- it's always in flux and ready to change with a changing environment. Evos have long denied this but the evidence is clear that genetics flatly contradicts the genetic deterministic nonsense that ToE was built on. (ToE could only make sense if one believes in genetic determinism.) And sure enough, for decades the genome was said to be immune from context and unchangeable except for the occasional random w.r.t. fitness mutation, but we now know that the genome is quickly able to cope and respond to physiological and environmental stresses in a purposeful, intelligent way. ToE is dead.",

   "Horizontal gene transfer can also occur, which allows genes to jump around from site to site in the genome and even convert other genes to their own sequences.\n\n \n You need to study your genetics a bit more. Transposons are NOT the same as horizontal gene transfers. As to geneticists and evoltutionists ignoring same, I suggest you look into the work by Barbara McLintock\n \n \n[McClintock was] interested in chromosome breakage, making important observations on the behavior of chromosomes lacking telomeres. ... These observations so intrigued her that she began an intensive investigation of the chromosome-breaking locus. Within several years she had learned enough to reach the conclusion, published in 1948, that the chromosome-breaking locus did something hitherto unknown for any genetic locus: it moved from one chromosomal location to another, a phenomenon she called transposition. The study of transposable genetic elements and transposition became the central theme of her genetic experiments from the mid-1940s until the end of her active research career. ...\n\n \n You might note that this sort of effect was known at about the same time as the Lederbergs experiments. In 1983 or so McClintock won the Nobel for physiology and medicine for her work on transposable elements.",

And whats going on is NOT in your phrase \"cope and respond to physiological and environmental stresses in a purposeful, intelligent way\". No intelligence is involved (unless you think corn thinks :xcensored ) and neither HGT nor transposable elements alter genomes through intent. The mechanisms are known you realize and your charges that evoltuionists and geneticists ignore these processes is untrue. Your own overlay of intelligent motivation of these processes is your own personal fantasy.",

   "So THIS is why Dawkins and all the other dreamers in the evolutionist camp decided to skip HGT talk. Now the dreamers have to face reality and tell us all how they can possibly construct any form of genetic tree when genes are hopping in and out of organisms and not relying on selection + sexual reproduction for their prolification.\n\n \n You might note that the paper in question was published in Science very recently. Here is the opening and the citation.\n \n \nOriginally published in Science Express on 30 August 2007\n Science 21 September 2007:\n Vol. 317. no. 5845, pp. 1753 - 1756\n DOI: 10.1126/science.1142490\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n Reports\n Widespread Lateral Gene Transfer from Intracellular Bacteria to Multicellular Eukaryotes\n Julie C. Dunning Hotopp,1*{dagger}{ddagger} Michael E. Clark,2* Deodoro C. S. G. Oliveira,2 Jeremy M. Foster,3 Peter Fischer,4 M\u00f3nica C. Mu\u00f1oz Torres,5 Jonathan D.

Spiro,1 Elodie Ghedin,1,7 Barton E. Slatko,3 Herv\u00e9 Tettelin,1{ddagger}\u00b6 John H. Werren2\u00b6\n \n Although common among bacteria, lateral gene transfer-the movement of genes between distantly related organisms-is thought to occur only rarely between bacteria and multicellular eukaryotes. However, the presence of endosymbionts, such as Wolbachia pipientis, within some eukaryotic germlines may facilitate bacterial gene transfers to eukaryotic host genomes. We therefore examined host genomes for evidence of gene transfer events from Wolbachia bacteria to their hosts. We found and confirmed transfers into the genomes of four insect and four nematode species that range from nearly the entire Wolbachia genome (<1 megabase) to short (<500 base pairs) insertions. Potential Wolbachia-to-host transfers were also detected computationally in three additional sequenced insect genomes. We also show that some of these inserted Wolbachia genes are transcribed within eukaryotic cells lacking endosymbionts. Therefore, heritable lateral gene transfer occurs into eukaryotic hosts from their prokaryote symbionts, potentially providing a mechanism for acquisition of new genes and functions.\n\n \n Given that the specific article was published less than a month ago I would hardly think that it has had time to impact Dawkins attending or not attending \"HGT talk\" of any sort. As to impacting analysis of relationships of linages are concerned from what I know of that process a gene incorporated from a symbiont is unlikely to bias the computation of the most likely set of genetic distances - especially after the point in time where the incorporation first occurred. By the way the transfer of prokaryotic symbiont genes into the nucleus of a eukaryote was one of the processes which led to the formation of endosymbiont organelles like chloroplasts and mitochondria. Both such organelles NOW have a reduced genome with many of their proteins being made in the nucleus rather than within the organelle. A convergence to interdependence which stabalizes the relationship by making it obligatory. Very interesting aspects of evolution there. Read Margulis.",
