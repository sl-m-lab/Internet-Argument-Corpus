I don't really care if they buy a plane as long as it's made in America. I think Boeing just announced the layoff of 10,000 employees due to slumping sales. Cessna has laid off people. Lockheed, too.\n \n The purchase of an American made airplane would definitely contribute more stimulus to the US economy than some of the tripe that Nancy Pelosi promotes in the new spending bill...such as condoms and birth control classes. I suppose that kind of stupidity is what we should expect from a product of California government. The woman is dangerous.",
