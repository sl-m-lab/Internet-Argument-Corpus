   "Did the IRS go too far?\n \n \n The Internal Revenue Service has warned one of Southern California's largest and most liberal churches that it is at risk of losing its tax-exempt status because of an antiwar sermon two days before the 2004 presidential election.\n \n Rector J. Edwin Bacon of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena told many congregants during morning services Sunday that a guest sermon by the church's former rector, the Rev. George F. Regas, on Oct. 31, 2004, had prompted a letter from the IRS.\n \n In his sermon, Regas, who from the pulpit opposed both the Vietnam War and 1991's Gulf War, imagined Jesus participating in a political debate with then-candidates George W. Bush and John Kerry. Regas said that \"good people of profound faith\" could vote for either man, and did not tell parishioners whom to support.\n \n But he criticized the war in Iraq, saying that Jesus would have told Bush, \"Mr. President, your doctrine of preemptive war is a failed doctrine. Forcibly changing the regime of an enemy that posed no imminent threat has led to disaster.\"\n \n On June 9, the church received a letter from the IRS stating that \"a reasonable belief exists that you may not be tax-exempt as a church ... \" The federal tax code prohibits tax-exempt organizations, including churches, from intervening in political campaigns and elections.\n \n The letter went on to say that \"our concerns are based on a Nov. 1, 2004, newspaper article in the Los Angeles Times and a sermon presented at the All Saints Church discussed in the article.\"\n \n The IRS cited The Times story's description of the sermon as a \"searing indictment of the Bush administration's policies in Iraq\" and noted that the sermon described \"tax cuts as inimical to the values of Jesus.\"\n http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-allsaints7nov07,0,6769876.story?coll=la-home-headlines",

   "Excerpt:\n \n \n\"We have staked the whole future of American civilization, not upon the power of government, far from it. We have staked the future of all of our political institutions upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.\"\n \n So said James Madison, architect of the Constitution, defender of religious freedom and fourth president of the United States, according to the Religious Right.\n \n But to church-state separationists and historians of the post-colonial period, something about this Madison quote has never felt quite right. It seemed unlikely that the same Madison who advocated \"total separation of the church from the state\" and battled to disestablish the Anglican Church in Virginia would say it. The sentiment appeared to clash with his well-known advocacy of a healthy distance between religion and government.\n \n A few years ago, with the quote popping up increasingly in the mass media (including Rush Limbaugh's daily radio show), Robert S. Alley, professor emeritus at the University of Richmond and author of James Madison on Religious Liberty, undertook a dogged effort to track it down. Enlisting the help of the editors of The Papers of James Madison at the University of Virginia, Alley scoured reams of documents, books and writings. After coming up empty-handed, the Madison scholar concluded that the quote was probably fictional.\n \n Now the major purveyor of the quote, Texas-based Religious Right propagandist David Barton, has admitted it's bogus. Last year Barton's group, WallBuilders' issued a one-page document titled \"Questionable Quotes,\" a list of 12 statements allegedly uttered by Founding Fathers and other prominent historical figures, that are now considered to be suspect or outright false. Madison's alleged comment about the Ten Commandments is number four on the list and is flatly declared by Barton to be \"false.\" (See [below] for a full list of the bogus quotes.)\n \n Advocates of separation of church and state were left breathless over Barton's audacity. For nearly 10 years, the Texas propagandist has traveled the country, putting on programs about America's alleged \"Christian heritage\" at fundamentalist churches and other venues. During these events, Barton argued that the separation of church and state is a myth foisted on the country by the Supreme Court 50 years ago. The United States, he insisted, was founded by Christians and was intended to be a fundamentalist-style \"Christian nation.\"\n \n What was Barton's proof for these claims? Many of the quotations he now admits are groundless! At least nine of the 12 were included in Barton's 1989 book, The Myth of Separation, and appeared in the video version, \"America's Godly Heritage.\" Barton was so enamored of one quote supposedly uttered by Benjamin Franklin (\"Whosoever shall introduce into the public affairs the principles of primitive Christianity will change the face of the world.\") that it was included on a biographical sketch WallBuilders distributes about Barton, saying it \"fully sums up what David believes and teachers.\" Barton now admits the quote is \"questionable\" and recommends people don't use it.\n \n Alley finds Barton's reliance on phony history disturbing. \"It's one thing to get up and make a speech and allude to something that isn't there, but when you have somebody parading a document in a book and that turns out to be an outright lie, it's more dangerous,\" Alley told Church & State magazine. \"The danger is that people will find credibility in what he does largely because he represents himself in that mode. He's a double fraud.\"\n \n Continued Alley, \"For Barton to withdraw these quotes is fine, but that doesn't change the fact that they were wrong to begin with.\"\n\n \n http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/founding.htm",

I'd as soon churches and pastors stick to matters of worship, myself. But all in all, I don't think it breaches their tax-exempt status. You have to remember this is a moral issue for them. As far as their concerned they might as well be encouraging people to vote against candidates who support any other thing they view is morally wrong. \n \n Churches have had a LONG history of this sort of thing, going back all the way to beginning of our country. In the late 1700s, churches were platforms for the voices of discontent in being beholden to England, helping lead to the Revolutionary war. Paul Revere himself used a church to warn of the oncoiming British soldiers. \n \n In the 19th century, both abolitionists and slavery-advocates BOTH used churches for their message. Can you imagine having punished churches for allowing abolitionist speakers? It too was a political issue. \n \n Also in the 19th and 20th centuries, there was a major alliance between churches and the temperance movement--make no mistake, churches played a HUGE role in the passing of the 18th amendment--prohibition. Ironically, the feminist movement (often today assumed to be a part of progressive liberalism) also heavily pushed for prohibition and was in bed with fundamentalist churches in getting it passed. They did so because of the rampant problems of spousal abuse by drunken husbands. Even though prohibition proved to be ill-advised, can you imagine punishing churches for allowing feminist speakers to encourage congregants in the issue of prohibition?\n \n Do you think churches were sterile of commentary from pulpits on the U.S. entering WWII? Surely you'd agree there were speakers in these churches that took a stand on that issue. Can you imagine punishing churches for that? \n \n So you simply don't have precedent on your side when it comes to this. Churches have, from the get-go, been platforms for people's views, including their political views. Is it constitutional? I don't know. I do know that apparently few have thought it was UN-constitutional, until now, given that it's been the norm for pretty much all of American history.",
