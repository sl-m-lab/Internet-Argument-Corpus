   "I'm really not sure how I should be responding to you Brady. You haven't made a single point in this new thread you've started. In fact all you've done is let the people know that the NRA store has new merchandise out.\n \n If you're going to follow the posting style of Galileo, and put forth the opinions of others and basically claim them as your own position, it would really be helpful if you picked someone with more credibility than Josh Sugarmann. Let's take a look at an entry he made dating back to June 2008:\n \n Josh Sugarmann: DC Ban on Semiauto Handguns Stands\n \n \nYesterday's decision flips legal logic and common sense on its head. As measured in gun death and injury, handguns are our nation's most lethal category of firearm: accounting for the vast majority of the 30,000 Americans who die from guns each year. They are also our nation's leading murder and suicide tool. Yet the majority opinion offers the greatest offender the strongest legal protection. It's analogous to the Court carving out special constitutional protection for child pornography in a First Amendment case.\n \n In its ruling, the Court brushed away our nation's history of mass shootings, assassinations, and unparalleled gun violence. It has instead accepted an abstract academic argument with dangerous real-world results for residents of the District of Columbia.\n\n \n In his blog entry Sugarmann exercises his gift for hyperbolic nonsense by making outrageous claims about the Supreme Court supposedly falling down on the job and failing to perform a duty it isn't charged with. Sugarmann's entry basically amounts to claiming that the Supreme Court should use temporary standards of modern society, to reinterpret the meaning and intent of the founding document of our nation. This would be akin to claiming that today's fears of terrorism should be used to remove the protections long recognized by the Fourth Amendment because domestic terrorists would exploit its protection to carry out bombings in the name of committing glorious acts of jihad.\n \n Josh Sugarmann -as well as you if you're adopting this position as your own- in making this latest entry seems to have chosen to simply disregard the actual experiences of people in everyday life who find themselves the victim of violent attacks; attacks where one needs to stab someone in order to survive the encounter and walk away alive. Sugarmann doesn't seem to mind talking about acts where somebody chose to break the law and commit assault against another, but he also doesn't seem to care about the well being of those that were assaulted and targeted. \n \n Here the NRA is making available to the public defensive tools that have a history of working for the intended purpose, and he's calling them paranoid. Personally I say it's more paranoid to fear that someone who chooses to exercise their constitutionally protected rights will simply become a danger to the public and needs to be strictly regulated.\n \n I've also noticed that when the logic used by supporters of gun control is applied to other points of discussion, those who originally supported the logic no longer want to have the discussion. To Galileo I pointed out how people with cameras are linked to the manufacture and distribution of child pornography, and he left the debate without making any further posts.\n \n On a final note is this simple fact. Not counting the laws in specific areas, everything Sugarmann mentions in his blog are perfectly legal to not only own but use. So his blog entry is nothing but bemoaning the sale of a legal product. That's like mocking an umbrella salesman and accusing him of peddling fear to move his product.",

You responded by throwing a red herring at me which didn't answer the question. I decided I had better things to do with my time than play games so I didn't continue the debate any further. Now you're just trying to muddy the waters. \n \n Let's get back to the topic of this thread. I hope these James Bond type weapons can't easily make it past airport security.

Now you're just trying to muddy the waters.\n\n \n If this is the truth then I believe you should've said something to signal that you were done, instead of simply not responding any longer. Failure to announce your leaving of a discussion doesn't sound like one deciding that they had better things to do. Instead it sounds more like one trying to run away from failure and insufficiency to maintain a position.\n \n \nLet's get back to the topic of this thread. I hope these James Bond type weapons can't easily make it past airport security.\n\n \n Fear mongering about airports and security isn't the topic of this thread. Since Brady had no input of his own to offer I'm not entirely sure there was a topic here.\n \n Just a few sentences ago you accused me of trying to muddy the waters. Now you're going and introducing airport security into a thread that has absolutely nothing to do with airport security and everything to do with the deficiencies of the Violence Policy Center and those that choose to cite them. It appears to me that you're the one attempting to muddy the waters here.\n \n \nI wonder what it means when it says that the \"tactical pen\" will get the job done.\n\n \n Well Sugarmann does quote \"breaking glass\" as a use for the tactical pen. So I'm assuming that if you need to get out of your car due to a crash, it makes for a fine escape tool. Or it could mean that it'll simply save your life when you need it to do just that.",

   "You again Galileo? You're showing up with more and more frequency than your previous posts would suggest. However the quality of the material you put forward as being of your own position doesn't seem to have improved any. Case in point:\n \n \nI suppose that people like to carry a gun around because it makes them feel more in control. They don't want to be a helpless victim of tragic circumstances.

Gun Possession Of Questionable Value In An Assault, Study Finds\n\n \n I've read this article very carefully. I call it an article because it's not the actual study that we were linked to, merely the abstract of the study that gives tidbits of information but not the overall picture. This presents problems.\n \n First and foremost, city officials have complained about the laws of Pennsylvania not allowing for home rule, and Philadelphia doesn't like that because they claim to have a serious crime problem. So serious in fact that they actually went ahead and broke state law in order to enact their own laws in an illegal and unenforceable manner. The fact that this \"study\" was performed in a city supposedly plagued with crime issues already suggests that honesty and neutrality was on the minds of those conducting it.\n \n Second on the list, the possession of a firearm at the time. The article talks about possession at the time of a shooting, and list examples such as in the vehicle, holster, waistband or pocket. But none of these options would suggest easy to view display that would alert someone that they were armed. The article mentions nothing about the number of people who were shot and were actually holding their gun at the time, or had it out in a clear and viewable manner. That too suggests that the accuracy of this \"study\" is highly questionable.\n \n Third up, the article says that the control group for the study were people who were \"randomly selected\" by phone and asked if they had a gun, if they had ever been shot, or if they ever shot anyone. Now personally I don't know about you, but if somebody just randomly calls me up and starts asking me about whether or not I have a gun, I'm just going to hang up on them. I have no way of verifying the validity of the call to tell if it's genuine or someone looking for a potential victim, and it's really nobody's business what I choose to own. And since there's no penalty for noncompliance with telephone solicitors I'm not inclined to say anything I don't agree with. To assume that someone will be honest with you over the telephone when they never met you is just plain foolish.\n \n Fourth, and perhaps the most relevant, is that the article fails to mention anything about legal status. We already know that the Philadelphia city officials consider the city to be highly dangerous and crime plagued territory, which leads one to wonder about those that were shot. There's no mention about how many of those 677 that were shot had some prior criminal record, how many were found to be in illegal possession of a firearm, or how many were engaged in criminal activity at the time of actually being shot. That is relevant information and we were denied access to it. Were any of these people shot during a dispute with a drug dealer? How many had gang affiliations and were shot by a rival gang member? How many of them had outstanding warrants in connection with felony offenses? It would be foolish to believe that all 677 of these people were doing absolutely nothing wrong at the time of being shot, because the real world just doesn't work like that.\n \n \nI have heard gun activists claim that guns are the great equalizer. It seems to me that this claim is very questionable and that, obviously, a gun benefits the person greatly who has the advantage of surprise. Consider the example of John Hinckley who attempted to assassinate a US president. Why was Hinckley able to injure three people despite all of the secret service agents near him? Because he had the advantage of surprise.\n\n \n So the win goes to the individual that made the premeditated and willful determination to commit deliberate harm to another? They decide to go out and hurt or kill someone on purpose, and you wish us to believe that being armed in response to such a threat is either foolish or downright dangerous?\n \n I have read many of your posts since I got here and started to replying to you. I've replied to quite a few that you've made in recent time, all of them with questionable material. To me this latest post of yours is even more questionable. You present us with an article summary of a study that's critically lacking in relevant information, expect us to take it at face value, and then go on to suggest that being armed in order to deal with a premeditated assault will either do no good at all, or might actually make things worse than they might've been if we just let this random stranger go ahead and assault us without opposition?\n \n \nAn advantage which is likely magnified by having a gun since more destruction can be committed with a gun between the time a criminal begins to attack and the time that people are able to respond defensively to an attack than with a more primitive weapon.\n\n \n I disagree. The advantage a firearm gives the premeditated offender is only an advantage due to laws that allow the one who breaks said laws in the first place, to obtain such an advantage in the first place.\n \n You've basically admitted that the one who made the premeditated decision to go out and hurt someone has the advantage. Making the premeditated determination to either hurt or kill another person is a felony offense and is supposed to bring either a sentence of life without the possibility or parole, or the death penalty depending on the circumstances.\n \n Now if someone is determined to commit a crime that could likely lead to them being put to death, why should I choose to believe that they won't commit and offense that only amounts to a misdemeanor in most places? Someone will commit a murder, but they won't illegally conceal a firearm in a public place? I don't buy it.\n \n \nA person who receives a concealed carry license after attending a three hour class is in an even less desirable position to defend against a crime with a gun than a secret service agent who is probably one of the most skilled people in the world at using a gun in self defense.\n\n \n Could you kindly not make such sweeping and negative stereotypical generalizations about concealed carry holders? Military and police personnel have concealed carry permits, they obviously know how to shoot. And some of the holders that I know are high class competition shooters who could give anybody in the Secret Service a run for their money.\n \n In the world of shooting sports there's a sport known as Tactical Three Gun. Look it up and you'll see some of the kinds of people that possess a concealed carry permit. There's hardly a lack of skill to be had.\n \n More important than that though. Regardless of a person's skill level, I feel it's better that they have the opportunity to make a difference and take steps to protect themselves, than to be told that their lack of skill is prohibitive in nature and will keep them from having a say in their own affairs.\n \n Citing a lack of experience really isn't a good suggestions for discussions such as this. As a comparison, nobody is ever prepared to be a parent the first time around, but it isn't mandatory for couples to obtain certificates of qualification before they can have a child of their own.\n \n Come to think of it, I'm not aware of any constitutionally protected activities that require a person to show proficiency before they can take part in said activities. I know that there used to be literacy tests for minority members to pass before they were allowed to vote, but such standards were outlawed.\n \n There are a number of isolated territories throughout the states that have their own requirements, but on the whole I'm unaware of any widespread laws that mandate a person must first take a safety test or show proficiency before they're legally allowed to buy a gun in the first place. Nor are there any known laws that require a person show that they underwent qualification tests before they can legally enter a plea of self defense when it comes to shooting a home invader or other dangerous individual.\n \n \nBecause of the limited effectiveness of guns as a self defense tools and because a gun may promote a false sense of security leading to a greater willingness to take risks, I don't think I'd ever carry a gun for self defense.\n\n \n You're entitled to your own opinions. However your opinions and false knowledge shouldn't be grounds for applying your standards to the rest of us, in an attempt to make us fall in line with what you believe.\n \n You claim guns are of limited effectiveness as a self defense tool. The numbers showing those with concealed carry permits, the number of guns purchased from year to year, and the fact that our military soldiers and police officers are armed with guns rather than other implements, suggest that your views are not shared by the majority of the country. Nor is there evidence to suggest that any other implement created in the 230+ years of this country's history is more effective than a gun when it comes to keeping someone safe.",

After all, they are so ineffective, you spend hours and hours on diatribes trying to sway people's opinion against carrying these insignificant tools. Why bother? \n \n Since the threat from them is so miniscule, you shouldn't have a problem with me carrying one then, right?\n \n Oh, I forgot. ANYTHING TO PROMOTE THE AGENDA. (Even when it conflicts with itself). There's a big clue, Galileo. When you see glaring conflicts in the reasoning of your argument, doesn't it raise a red flag? Even to you?\n \n 1) Guns are so dangerous we need to ban them.\n 2) Guns are so ineffective, people don't really need them for self defense.\n \n Well? Are you telling me you can't see the conflict? How can someone as intelligent as you NOT see it? Unless, you somehow intellectually steer your mind around it in some form of denial process brought on by some kind of unswerving loyalty to an agenda.\n \n 1) Guns are so simple as to allow children to mow innocent bystanders down without aim.\n 2) Guns are so technical, only experts can use them with any effectiveness.\n \n Both conflicting examples forward the anti agenda. Guess which one will be used to do so. Yup. BOTH. Mutually exclusive?....aaaaaaa! Who cares? Use them anyway. After all, FACTS only matter in ALL OTHER AREAS WE NEED SCIENTIFIC PROOF. When it comes to firearms, EMOTIONAL arguments are what counts no matter how conflicting they may be.\n \n Speaking of emotional arguments......\n \n Addressing your first paragraph:\n \n You have a lot to say about how carrying a weapon makes one feel. Lots of lines in there about feeling safer, and feeling confident. Very emotional based. \n \n Maybe next time, you can offer us some food for thought on reality. Feelings don't stop bullets. Do you think any students at Virginia Tech felt like they needed a gun when they walked into their classrooms shortly before Cho Seung-Hui walked in and started shooting? How did anyone's feelings affect the outcome? I'm sure nobody felt like being shot. According to you, since feelings of security are what it's all about, their feelings should have deflected the bullets, right? Do you think cops carry guns to make them feel safer, or as a useful, real, tool to defend themselves with?\n \n A gun is a tool. It is like any other tool. Do you ever worry about how a carpenter feels about using a hammer to pound nails? How come nobody asks how a mechanic feels about the wrench he uses? It is only another tool, like a gun, used for a specific purpose. How come nobody is concernned with the feelings of a hairstylist? After all, they use scissors. How do those scissors make them feel? Chefs use knives. How do you think those sharp, dangerous, edged tools make them feel?\n \n What? Their feelings about the tools they use are irrellevant?\n \n Then why all the concern about the tool I use to keep myself safe? Why do my feelings of safety, manhood, virility, and any other feelings now become so important?\n \n Want the TRUTH?\n \n It has nothing to do with any feelings on my part. To me, a gun is an inanimate tool. The only feelings that are at issue are ones that are brought by someone concerned with such things.\n \n Now, between you and me, Galileo, which of us bases their argument solely on feelings and not on concrete, factual, evidence (reality)?\n \n Now, I'd suggest that in order to further your agenda, far fetched suppositions and hypothesized theories about the feelings of safety by those who carry guns be left out of your argument. This is mere advice, as using appeals to feelings only shines a spotlight on an ineffective and pointless ideal only focused on by those concerned with emotion and not with actual FACTS.\n \n Of course, if you didn't use an emotional based argument, you'd be rather quiet as the fact based argument for gun control has been completely detroyed long ago. Therefore, I guess I can't fault you for resorting to the only argument left to you no matter how pointless it is.\n \n \n Addressing the article between your paragraphs:\n \n You do realize that the study was done in an urban area in a very anti-gun city where the instances of lawful gun ownership is extremely low (not to mention the likelihood of a valid CCW permit which is even lower)? Whatever you do, don't interview people in an area concurrent with the demographics of a regular legally armed citizen. (After all, you anti-gunners are always ranting about CCW holders are all middle-aged, overweight, crusty old white guys!) I guess this is why the study was done in an area so chock full of those middle aged, overweight white guys...oh wait! URBAN PHILIDELPHIA! Yeah. All those middle aged white guys you're always lampooning! You can't even CHEAT with any integrity!\n \n Addressing your second paragraph:\n \n 2) Here's a good read about your focus on equilization. You say the claims are \"questionable\"? Well this should take your questions and put them to rest: Why Carrying a Gun is a Civilized Act \n \n Footnote:\n \n 1) If the actual defensive use of a gun is so overrated, why am I able to Google \"self defense shooting\" and receive 20,000 hits in .64 seconds all listing the actual individual names of persons who have effectively used a gun in self defense, but I can give you 3 days to simply list (1) individual name of a person saved by a gun control law and the actual law that saved them, and I'm willing to bet we don't see a reply doing so?",
