   "Firstly, you have to start thinking on the epic scale of the omnipotent being (i.e spanning the full extent of the universe, as well as those that might precede and survive it) something that seems to cause the suffering of several billion people might lead to creation of something that will benefit countless billions upon billions. What we might consider benevolent now, might not be in the grand scheme of things.\n \n Now with regards to the omnipotent thing, you need to firstly clarify what sort of omnipotence you are talking about, whether we have a being who can do anything that is possible (which might boil down to a human) or something that can make four sided triangles.\n Assuming we are talking near-true omnipotence, we suddenly encounter a being that can end itself and the entirity of creation. This deity might have a philosophical problem with making a perfect world - as such a universe would be without purpose, in just existing to exist it renders any good pointless. The deity then has to decide whether it would prefer a universe where more good than bad happens and whether it is willing to consider an ammoral universe as 'good' (i.e does a universe need more good than bad to be 'good', or is an equal balance acceptable). Is a life of suffering better or worse than oblivion? \n \n On top of this, just because a entity is benevolent and omnipotent does't mean it knows how to use its own powers. It might be omniscient with regards to its created universe but as it exists outside the universe it might have no idea what it has to do to create total perfection (if it even knows what it is).\n \n The set of three god powers aren't exactly defined. Will an all good deity settle for balance or neutrality? Can an all powerful being break its own rules? Doesn't the all knowing entity need to be truely omnipotent or is otherwise going to be unaware of everything that holds its own information.\n \n They are nice words, but pretty much all are logical impossibilities anyway (seeing as 'good' is completely subjective).",

God isn't a control freak. You will get a more comprehensive discussion of the following in Chapter 7 of Kenneth Miller's Finding Darwin's God.\n \n Basically, our lives have to have meaning. That is, what we choose has to have real consequences. That includes how we treat our fellow human beings -- including acts that cause unhappiness -- and how we react to what happens to us. Do we react with grace, compassion, and courage? Or do we react with selfishness and cowardice? \n \n So God created a real universe with real consequences.

What you see is converted to nerve impulses in the retina and that becomes what we see. But there is an objective entity out there that causes those nerve impulses.\n \n Now, we \"see\" in dreams. So, it's obvious that the nerve impulses can be triggered by stimuli other than objective entities. The experiments that you describe are the same thing: artificial stimulation of the nerve impulses. I took the effort to get Persinga's work -- that is the one on sensed presence. If you look at the methodology closely, Persinga can stimulate sensed presence by very complex and artificial electromagnetic impulses. The problem is that you aren't going to encounter such impulses in nature. Therefore the experiments don't explain why people not in the experiments have the sensed presence.\n \n OTOH, it's obvious that deity is going to have to communicate with us thru our material brains. What Persinga's experiments show are the internal circuits that would be triggered by deity. Only if you can find a common natural situation to reproduce the signals would you have an argument that sensed presence is not due to deity. \n \n \nYou can have your 'god' feelings, but you can't create a 'god' detector.\n\n \n No one has created a machine to do that yet. But, if the experiences are valid (and you have to show that each and every one is not), then evolution created one.\n \n Look, I'm not trying to convince you to be theist. What I am doing is looking at specific arguments you are using against theism and testing them to see if they are valid. I've already indicated that there is a valid argument for adhering to atheism.\n \n Unfortunately, you won't be able to find it as long as you keep incorrectly attacking the validity of personal experience.",

   "Its easy if you're omnipotent. \n\n \n No, it's not. Of course, we can discard omnipotence and just say that God is very powerful but not omnipotent.\n \n Remember that we have 2 conflicting entities: free will and universal happiness. In order for us to never do anything that would cause unhappiness to another person, God would have completely regiment our thoughts and actions. But then there goes the ability to choose.\n \n \nRegardless of free will or not, we are very strongly influenced by past events and biology with regard to our actions not to mention that our free will is diluted by our limited abilities - we can only choose to do things that we are capable of. Given that all those things have been previously set by God to begin with, then hes already made some pretty huge inroads on free will.\n\n \n This is a mistaken view of free will. You are using free will in the sense that we are able to choose among limitless possibilitiies. But that isn't free will. Free will is simply the ability to choose among alternatives. There are many factors that limit the number of choices. For instance, in going from work to home, biology means that I can't choose to fly; I don't have wings. Geography, time limitations, and my physical limitations mean I can't swim to work. I can't choose that one.\n \n However, I can choose to drive myself, carpool, or take public transportation. If I drive myself, I have a number of choices as to routes and the method that I drive: carefully or not so carefully.\n \n Now, if God were to try to make everyone happy all the time, God would have to step into either my body or my mind and use force (mild force but force) to keep me from speeding, make sure that I always make the careful decisions, etc. in order to prevent my causing an accident.\n \n Maybe you want a control freak god like that, but I'm glad that God isnt like that. Well, from our conversations, you would want a god like that. It's such an easy strawman to argue against. After all, since bad things do happen to good people, it's obvious that such a control freak god does not exist.",

But it is a minority position within theism. Welcome to invalid synecdoche. Sometimes known as making a strawman argument.\n \n IMO, it is human tendency to want to ascribe supernatural backing to some of the horrific things that humans do to each other -- especially when you are on the receiving end. Thus you see the slow transformation of Satan from a simple gofer for God to an archenemy and polar opposite. People need something to blame for the persecution they are undergoing. \n \n Notice that nearly all this transformation takes place out of scripture so that the minority position that there is a battle of good vs evil comes from the Essenes, Book of Enoch, some gospels and letters not included in the canon, Milton, and Dante. That says nothing about its accuracy, but it does contradict that monotheism requires such a battle or that all versions of monotheism have such a battle.",

That badly damages the evidential value of reports of such experiences.\n\n \n It doesn't damage it at all.

The problem with the experiments is that there is no natural situation that is going to recreate the signals they used in the experiments. Now, are there other natural phenomenon that would trigger the circuit? Fairly common ones? No one has reported such. But it's possible; I can't rule it out. Can an internal state trigger the circuit? Again, possible, but no one has reliably associated any mental state with sensed presence. Certainly no state that would be present in otherwise sane and healthy people.\n \n And there is another question: why do we have such a circuit at all? Why hasn't evolution eliminated such a circuit as not useful and a waste of energy to make?

   "Actually, no. All the jurists have to do is decide that the women are believable beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n For that to be the case there would have to be some additional characteristic of the women, over and above their mere words, that rendered their testimony more believable than the guards'. This goes beyond the simple 'one word against another' scenario you originally set up: you have moved the goalposts. To move from the analogy back to the original issue, do you claim that those reporting experience of sensing the presence of a deity possess such a property, making their testimony more believable?\n \nIt doesn't damage it at all. After all, in dreams no such object need to be in front of the eyes for sensation of sight to be experienced. That doesn't negate that the object actually does exist when a person sees it with open eyes.\n\n I'm surprised you invoke dreams as evidence for your side of the argument. Dreams are a classic demonstration that the brain can be persuaded, without extraordinary external intervention, of the reality of non-existent presences and events: exactly the position of those who are sceptical of 'religious experience'.\n \nALL the experiments demonstrate is that there is a brain circuit for experiencing presences that are not physically there. Well, in order to detect presences that aren't there, there MUST be such a circuit.\n\n There is no such 'must'. It is entirely possible that such sensations are an epiphenomenon of some other brain activity; dreams themselves are considered by some workers to be such an epiphenomenon, arising as scraps of memory are sorted and deleted during REM sleep.\n \nAnd there is another question: why do we have such a circuit at all? Why hasn't evolution eliminated such a circuit as not useful and a waste of energy to make?\n\n Firstly, the 'circuit' need not have evolved for this function in the first instance: see above. More fundamentally, who says a religious sensibility is not evolutionarily advantageous? I for one am certain that survival of early human societies was aided enormously by the commonality of purpose and sense of control imposed by shared belief in supernatural forces.\n \nOf course, if the people are really communicating with deity, it is easy to find all kinds of selective advantage for that to our evolutionary ancestors.\n\n But the selective advantage is just as real even if the deity is not. It is the believing, and the sharing of belief, that imposes the advantage: it wasn't necessary for Quetzalcoatl to exist for Aztec society to reap the benefits of believing he did.",

More endorphins = more of the feeling called \"happiness.\" The real question, I suppose, is: \"if endorphins are constantly released, is a resistance built up?\"\n If the answer is yes, that indicates that God could not make people happy all of the time, but that that situation is his fault (he created people, right?).\n If the answer is no, then God could make people happy constantly, but doesn't.\n (Required disclaimer: I do not intend to indicate that I accept the existance of a deity. I am simply exploring the possibility to look for conflicts.)\n\n i suppose god could certainly overdose us with endorphines continuously, but will that change the effect that outside events have on our lives? the reason why i asked about your definition of the CAUSE of happiness is that when an event occurs, i wanted you to tell me how you determine if its good or bad. when an event occurs that affects our lives, we put it on a subjective good/bad scale. based on where it lands on the scale, this is what causes us to be happy or not. at least that's my analysis, do you disagree?\n \n \nProbably no. That said, I would like to point out that a minimum of temperature fluctuation needs to be experienced for one to feel \"warm\" in comparison to feeling \"cold.\" Similarly, a state of happiness (defined as a comparative term) can be mantained with only short breaks.\n\n this is the nature of relativity. ot cannot exist unless its relative counterpart also exists.\n \n lets look at the original question by going back to what god actually did: put adam and eve in a garden insulated from all bad events. they had food, comfortable surroundings and the presence of god. plus they had the companionship of each other and the responsibility to tend to the garden (whatever that entailed). would you say that adam and eve would have been continuously happy in such an environment? would they have been experiencing an perpetual endorphine high?",

If god is willing to allow some to have limited free will, why doesn't he limit it a bit more and stop people from killing each other?\n Why doesn't he make sure that people in the situation of a prisoner's dilemma cooperate so they will both be happy?\n\n actually, god could limit people's free will so that they wouldnt kill each other. everybody would be robots doing only what god wanted them to do. i suspect angels function this way, and like i said, in heaven, most likely resurrected people would be this way too. but i think god doesnt want people to be robots. there's no point in rewarding a robot for carrying out what you programmed it to do.\n \n the prisoner's dilema doesnt control or limit free will. in fact, its a calculated decision tree.\n \nNice sidestep. My point was that they never have a time without as much suffering to be able to compare to the time when they were suffering.\n\n lets not get too emotional. somebody who had a lifetime of suffering would have to compare somebody else's life of less suffering. \n \n everybody has to bear their own weight due to body mass and gravity. this is an inconvenience that everybody is inflicted with. but we dont consider it suffering, because its common to everybody, and there is no group that escapes the burden of their weight. if some people didnt have a weight problem and others did, there would certainly be an outcry that the weight bearing group is \"suffering all their life\". thats because theres a group that suffers relatively less to compare to\n \n \nSo why would god have created a place where people were punished eternally for not believing in him without evidence?\n \n But he set those consequences.\n Why does it seem that he is not all-loving?\n\n hell is the counterpart to heaven. if heaven is extreme positivity, then hell is extreme negativity. the argument for why hell should or shouldnt be so horrible is exactly the argument for why heaven should or shouldnt be so blissful. we always encounter the argument that god is malicious because he created hell to be so terrible, yet never seem to have a problem with heaven being so great. suppose we tone down hell, so that if you die a non-believer all you get is a slap on the wrist, and we proportionately tone down heaven so that when you die all you get is a pat on the back, would that make god seem more all-loving?\n \n the both consequences balance out evenly if you ask me. god, by being the terrible fiend that created heaven, and the glorious king that created heaven, seems just as loving. if you dont look at the whole picture, your judgement will be badly biased\n \n \nPascal's wager... Hopefully you don't mean that as a reason to believe in your god. Even Pascal didn't use it that way...\n\n my god? watch those emotions, my friend. your question was if someone believed that god didnt exist, would that be grounds to go to hell. to spell it out, if someone didnt believe that god existed, and god actually existed, they would go to hell. pascal's wager sums it up, but you missed it. follow the context of the discussion \n \n \n\"Could end you up in hell...\"\n It is nice of you to admit that it is rational not to believe in god based on the evidence. Will you take that back when the Pascal's wager angle is refuted?\n\n faith is the opposite of rationality. this is no secret. taking something on faith as being irrational has nothing to do with pascal's wager\n \n \nCouldn't god have created a universe in which it was possible to be happy without minding the suffering which came with it?\n\n he did... the garden of eden, and heaven. no suffering exists there, although i cannot possibly imagine how it there could be happiness in either place\n \n \nAlso, are you saying that heaven gets boring after a while and that people are forced to spend eternity there anyway?\n\n you read what i typed fairly correctly\n \n \nWhy does god want faith?\n Most celebrities I know don't mind giving evidence of their existance... They get more attention that way.\n Why should god care if there is evidence of his existance?\n\n everything we know about god, including everything i've argued thus far, is based on what the bible says. i quoted a scripture directly out of the bible that spells out the nature of god as far as rational evidence is concerned. the question \"why\" is beyond my scope. its in the bible, and the bible says that whatever is in the bible is the truth about god. not much to do there...\n \n \nThat is your view. Christian scientists would say that your view violates god's will. Why should I believe one rather than another?\n In particular, why should I believe the one without evidence?\n\n the bible is clear on its requirements for those who wish to please god. if you have evidence that something is true, then you dont need faith to believe it. and if you dont have faith, you cant please god.",

However, in my mind there is a distinction between \"incapable of understanding God\" and \"not able to understand God completely.\"\n \n Incapable of understanding God, to me, implies that we have no ability to understand anything about God at all, period. However, I know this to be untrue. There is much of God I DO understand. There is much more that I do not, but I still understand God at least on some level. Theists do not say that they cannot understand God. You use it in a form that implies that we should not try and should just accept everything.\n \n This cannot be farther from the truth for me and for a whole host of christians. In fact, the verse \"Seek first the kindom of heaven and His righteousness...\" makes it very clear that we should seek to know God. There are many other verses (the one in first john for instance). The very fact that Jesus (God the son) came to earth to dwell among us is why we know God wants to be known. The new testament tells us that Jesus is the exact representation of God the father. \n \n I simply do not accept the statement that we cannot understand God. It is too simplistic and leaves too much out. We can know and understand God but to a degree.\n \n As I said, if this is really what you are saying (and again, I have not read all the posts) then I do agree with you. I just prefer that you restate your premise to be more precise.\n \n EF",

   "I am starting this thread because I have asked this one question many times and I have never gotten a satisfying answer. In fact, the only answer I got was, \"That strays to far from the topic of this thread.\"\n I intend to get an answer this time.\n \n Here's the question: how can a benevolent, omnipotent god exist in a universe with so much unhappiness?\n\n \n Here's a religious answere to your question I got from a book:\n \n WHY SO MUCH SUFFERING?\n 5 People of various religions have gone to their religious leaders and teachers to ask why there is so much suffering. Often, the response is that suffering is God's will and that he long ago determined everything that would ever happen, including tragic events. Many are told that God's ways are mysterious or that he brings death upon people-even children-so that he can have them in heaven with him. As you have learned, though, God God never causes what is bad. The Bible says: \"Far be it from the true God to act wickedly, and the Almighty to act unjustly!\"-Job 34:10.\n 6 Do you know why people make the mistake of blaming God for all the suffering in the world? In many cases, they blame Almighty God because they think that he is the real ruler of this world. They do not know a simple but important truth that the Bible teaches. You learned that truth in Chapter 3 of this book. The real ruler of this world is Satan the Devil.\n 7 The Bible clearly states: \"The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.\" (1 John 5:19) When you think about it, does that not make sense? This world reflects the personality of the invisible spirit creature who is \"misleading the entire inhabited earth.\" (Revelation 12:9) Satan is hateful, deceptive, and cruel. So the world, under his influence, is full of hatred, deceit, and cruelty. That is one reason why there is so much suffering.\n 8 A second reason why there is so much suffering is that, as discussed in Chapter 3, mankind has been imperfect and sinful ever since the rebellion in the garden of Eden. Sinful humans tend to struggle for dominance, and this results in wars, oppression, and suffering. (Ecclesiastes 4:1; 8:9) A third reason for suffering is \"time and unforeseen occurrence.\" (Ecclesiastes 9:11) In a world without God as a protective Ruler, people may suffer because they happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n 9 It is comforting for us to know that God does not cause suffering. He is not responsible for the wars, the crimes, the oppression, or even the natural disasters that cause people to suffer. Still, we need to know, Why does God allow all this suffering? If he is the Almighty, he has the power to stop it. Why, then, does he hold back? The loving God that we have come to know must have a good reason.-1 John 4:8.\n \n A VITAL ISSUE IS RAISED\n 10 To find out why God allows suffering, we need to think back to the time when suffering began. When Satan led Adam and Eve into disobeying God, an important question was raised. Satan did not call into question God's power. Even Satan knows that there is no limit to God's power. Rather, Satan questioned God's right to rule. By calling God a liar who withholds good from his subjects, Satan charged that God is a bad ruler. (Genesis 3:2-5) Satan implied that mankind would be better off without God's rulership. This was an attack on God's sovereignty, his right to rule.\n 11 Adam and Eve rebelled against God. In effect, they said: \"We do not need God as our Ruler. We can decide for ourselves what is right and what is wrong.\" How could God settle that issue? How could he teach all intelligent creatures that the rebels were wrong and that his way truly is best? Someone might say that God should simply have destroyed the rebels and made a fresh start. But God had stated his purpose to fill the earth with the offspring of Adam and Eve, and he wanted them to live in an earthly paradise. (Genesis 1:28) God always fulfills his purposes. (Isaiah 55:10, 11) Besides that, getting rid of the rebels in Eden would not have answered the question that had been raised regarding God's right to rule.\n 12 Let us consider an illustration. Imagine that a teacher is telling his students how to solve a difficult problem. A clever but rebellious student claims that the teacher's way of solving the problem is wrong. Implying that the teacher is not capable, this rebel insists that he knows a much better way to solve the problem. Some students think that he is right, and they also become rebellious. What should the teacher do? If he throws the rebels out of the class, what will be the effect on the other students? Will they not believe that their fellow student and those who joined him are right? All the other students in the class might lose respect for the teacher, thinking that he is afraid of being proved wrong. But suppose that the teacher allows the rebel to show the class how he would solve the problem.\n 13 God has done something similar to what the teacher does. Remember that the rebels in Eden were not the only ones involved. Millions of angels were watching. (Job 38:7; Daniel 7:10) How God handled the rebellion would greatly affect all those angels and eventually all intelligent creation. So, what has God done? He has allowed Satan to show how he would rule mankind. God has also allowed humans to govern themselves under Satan's guidance.\n 14 The teacher in our illustration knows that the rebel and the students on his side are wrong. But he also knows that allowing them the opportunity to try to prove their point will benefit the whole class. When the rebels fail, all honest students will see that the teacher is the only one qualified to lead the class. They will understand why the teacher thereafter removes any rebels from the class. Similarly, God knows that all honesthearted humans and angels will benefit from seeing that Satan and his fellow rebels have failed and that humans cannot govern themselves. Like Jeremiah of old, they will learn this vital truth: \"I well know, O God, that to earthling man his way does not belong. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.\"-Jeremiah 10:23.\n \n WHY SO LONG?\n 15 Why, though, has God allowed suffering to go on for so long? And why does he not prevent bad things from happening? Well, consider two things that the teacher in our illustration would not do. First, he would not stop the rebel student from presenting his case. Second, the teacher would not help the rebel to make his case. Similarly, consider two things that God has determined not to do. First, he has not stopped Satan and those who side with him from trying to prove that they are right. Allowing time to pass has thus been necessary. In the thousands of years of human history, mankind has been able to try every form of self-rule, or human government. Mankind has made some advances in science and other fields, but injustice, poverty, crime, and war have grown ever worse. Human rule has now been shown to be a failure.\n 16 Second, God has not helped Satan to rule this world. If God were to prevent horrible crimes, for instance, would he not, in effect, be supporting the case of the rebels? Would God not be making people think that perhaps humans can govern themselves without disastrous results? If God were to act in that way, he would become party to a lie. However, \"it is impossible for God to lie.\"-Hebrews 6:18.\n 17 What, though, about all the harm that has been done during the long rebellion against God? We do well to remember that God is almighty. Therefore, he can and will undo the effects of mankind's suffering. As we have already learned, the ruining of our planet will be undone by the turning of the earth into Paradise. The effects of sin will be removed through faith in Jesus' ransom sacrifice, and the effects of death will be reversed by means of the resurrection. God will thus use Jesus \"to break up the works of the Devil.\" (1 John 3:8) God will bring all of this about at just the right time. We can be glad that he has not acted sooner, for his patience has given us the opportunity to learn the truth and to serve him. (2 Peter 3:9, 10) Meanwhile, God has been actively seeking sincere worshipers and helping them to endure any suffering that may come upon them in this troubled world.-John 4:23; 1 Corinthians 10:13.\n 18 Some might wonder, Could all this suffering have been prevented if God had created Adam and Eve in such a way that they could not rebel? To answer that question, you need to remember a precious gift that God has given you.\n \n HOW WILL YOU USE THE GIFT FROM GOD?\n 19 As was noted in Chapter 5, humans were created with free will. Do you realize what a precious gift that is? God has made countless animals, and these are driven largely by instinct. (Proverbs 30:24) Man has made some robots that can be programmed to follow every command. Would we be happy if God had made us like that? No, we are glad to have the freedom to make choices about what kind of person to become, what course of life to pursue, what friendships to form, and so on. We love to have a measure of freedom, and that is what God wants us to enjoy.\n 20 God is not interested in service performed under compulsion. (2 Corinthians 9:7) To illustrate: What would please a parent more-a child's saying \"I love you\" because he is told to say it or his saying it freely from the heart? So the question is, How will you use the free will that God has given you? Satan, Adam, and Eve made the worst possible use of free will. They rejected God God. What will you do?\n 21 You have the opportunity to put the marvelous gift of free will to the best possible use. You can join the millions who have taken a stand on God's side. They make God rejoice because they take an active part in proving Satan a liar and a miserable failure as a ruler. (Proverbs 27:11) You too can do that by choosing the right course of life. This will be explained in the next chapter.\n \n WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES\n &#9642; God does not cause the bad conditions in the world.-Job 34:10.\n &#9642; By calling God a liar and saying that He withholds good from His subjects, Satan questioned God's right to rule.-Genesis 3:2-5.\n &#9642; God will use his Son, the Ruler of the Messianic Kingdom, to end all human suffering and to undo its effects.-1 John 3:8.",
