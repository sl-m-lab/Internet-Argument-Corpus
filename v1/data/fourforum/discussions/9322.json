   "Well, evolutionists are up to their old tricks. The absurdity continues to reach new lows.\n \n They now, in all their intellectual glory, have identified a so-called \"suicide gene.\" And since evolutionists believe that mutations are selected and then passed on to offspring because of their wonderful benefit, they're now in a position where they need to pull a rabbit out of a hat and convince people that killing themselves is biologically beneficial. Hey don't laugh -- these college-educated folks have already declared Depression a beneficial trait. What's to stop them from claiming that a bullet to the head or purposeful drug overdose is beneficial as well?? It's the next logical step if one's common sense is out to lunch.\n \n http://www.heall.com/healingnews/june/suicide.html\n \n \n Suicide is the world's ninth leading cause of death. The researchers found a mutation in a gene that regulates the brain's level of serotonin, one of the proteins that carries messages between cells. They estimated that the mutation more than doubles the risk of suicidal behavior in those who have it. ``Individuals who carry the (mutation) are at higher risk when a situation that triggers their suicidal tendencies will occur,'' neurobiologist Dr. Pavel Hrdina, who co-wrote the landmark study, told the Post.\n \n Now can someone tell me why in the world this gene would be selected for? I mean what possible biological benefit could arise for killing yourself? Why in the world would a gene mutation that reduces serotonin be helpful? This of course, says nothing to the fact that it would be impossible to breed after you're dead. \n \n But just on an outside chance -- could it not be that mutations are merely the result of non-accidental biological processes within the body? Could it not be that being \"selected\" has nothing what-so-ever to do with killing yourself? Could it not be that people who are seriously depressed experience certain mutations that other people do not?...and that these mutations are brought on by emotional cues? And it would be no different with Depression, anxiety, Adhd, cancer -- or any other disease. Could all these not have holistic or environmental explanations? \n \n The hoops that evolutionists have to jump through to keep this silly theory afloat are incredible.",

   "Could it be that you've stumbled upon a fatal mutation? I thought you denied the existance of detrimental mutation. If this is true, then it seems pretty detrimental to me.\n \n Also, merely reducing the level of seratonin does not force suicide on someone. They may be more vulnerable to pressures making them commit suicide, but that does not mean they will be exposed to those pressures. They may have relatively stress free lives.\n \n I'd personally say that the presence of that mutation kinda undermines SS's version of infinite idividual adaptation, as why would an individual develop a mutation that would make you commit suicide? Kinda stupid if you can control your own adaptation....\n \n N.B. Ensure that the 'suicide gene' name is the one it has been given by scientists. It may be just the media jumping on a word in the report. Happens all the time in palaeo....",

Or are the scientists saying this gene mutation causes serotonin uptake problems? They have also found gene mutations which lead to greater incidences of cancer and other diseases. I don't see how this challenges the theory of evolution.\n \n Previously, people believed there was no reason to have the sickle cell gene. Later they realized that sickle cells made a person less vulnerable to malaria. Evolution doesn't (and will probably never) go the way supersport unwittingly believes it should.\n \n I truly doubt you believe the scientists are logically concluding that depression does not have any environmental factors at all. A person who is more prone to schizophrenia genetically may or may not get this due to their environment.\n \n I don't think you understood what you read. Maybe you should let go of your superstitious biases, and believe in reality.",
