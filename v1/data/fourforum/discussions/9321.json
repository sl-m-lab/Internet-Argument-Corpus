   "The Truth About Homework\n \n Needless Assignments Persist Because of Widespread Misconceptions About Learning\n \n By Alfie Kohn\n \n \n \n There's something perversely fascinating about educational policies that are clearly at odds with the available data. Huge schools are still being built even though we know that students tend to fare better in smaller places that lend themselves to the creation of democratic caring communities. Many children who are failed by the academic status quo are forced to repeat a grade even though research shows that this is just about the worst course of action for them. Homework continues to be assigned - in ever greater quantities - despite the absence of evidence that it's necessary or even helpful in most cases.\n \n The dimensions of that last disparity weren't clear to me until I began sifting through the research for a new book. To begin with, I discovered that decades of investigation have failed to turn up any evidence that homework is beneficial for students in elementary school. Even if you regard standardized test results as a useful measure, homework (some versus none, or more versus less) isn't even correlated with higher scores at these ages. The only effect that does show up is more negative attitudes on the part of students who get more assignments.\n \n In high school, some studies do find a correlation between homework and test scores (or grades), but it's usually fairly small and it has a tendency to disappear when more sophisticated statistical controls are applied. Moreover, there's no evidence that higher achievement is due to the homework even when an association does appear. It isn't hard to think of other explanations for why successful students might be in classrooms where more homework is assigned - or why they might spend more time on it than their peers do.\n \n The results of national and international exams raise further doubts. One of many examples is an analysis of 1994 and 1999 Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) data from 50 countries. Researchers David Baker and Gerald Letendre were scarcely able to conceal their surprise when they published their results last year: \"Not only did we fail to find any positive relationships,\" but \"the overall correlations between national average student achievement and national averages in [amount of homework assigned] are all negative.\"\n \n Finally, there isn't a shred of evidence to support the widely accepted assumption that homework yields nonacademic benefits for students of any age. The idea that homework teaches good work habits or develops positive character traits (such as self-discipline and independence) could be described as an urban myth except for the fact that it's taken seriously in suburban and rural areas, too.\n \n In short, regardless of one's criteria, there is no reason to think that most students would be at any sort of disadvantage if homework were sharply reduced or even eliminated. Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of American schools - elementary and secondary, public and private - continue to require their students to work a second shift by bringing academic assignments home. Not only is this requirement accepted uncritically, but the amount of homework is growing, particularly in the early grades. A large, long-term national survey found that the proportion of six- to-eight-year-old children who reported having homework on a given day had climbed from 34 percent in 1981 to 58 percent in 1997 - and the weekly time spent studying at home more than doubled.\n \n Sandra Hofferth of the University of Maryland, one of the authors of that study, has just released an update based on 2002 data. Now the proportion of young children who had homework on a specific day jumped to 64 percent, and the amount of time they spent on it climbed by another third. The irony here is painful because with younger children the evidence to justify homework isn't merely dubious - it's nonexistent.\n \n *\n \n So why do we do something where the cons (stress, frustration, family conflict, loss of time for other activities, a possible diminution of interest in learning) so clearly outweigh the pros? Possible reasons include a lack of respect for research, a lack of respect for children (implicit in a determination to keep them busy after school), a reluctance to question existing practices, and the top-down pressures to teach more stuff faster in order to pump up test scores so we can chant \"We're number one!\"\n \n All these explanations are plausible, but I think there's also something else responsible for our continuing to feed children this latter-day cod-liver oil. Because many of us believe it's just common sense that homework would provide academic benefits, we tend to shrug off the failure to find any such benefits. In turn, our belief that homework ought to help is based on some fundamental misunderstandings about learning.\n \n Consider the assumption that homework should be beneficial just because it gives students more time to master a topic or skill. (Plenty of pundits rely on this premise when they call for extending the school day or year. Indeed, homework can be seen as a way of prolonging the school day on the cheap.) Unfortunately, this reasoning turns out to be woefully simplistic. Back \"when experimental psychologists mainly studied words and nonsense syllables, it was thought that learning inevitably depended upon time,\" reading researcher Richard C. Anderson and his colleagues explain. But \"subsequent research suggests that this belief is false.\"\n \n The statement \"People need time to learn things\" is true, of course, but it doesn't tell us much of practical value. On the other hand, the assertion \"More time usually leads to better learning\" is considerably more interesting. It's also demonstrably untrue, however, because there are enough cases where more time doesn't lead to better learning.\n \n In fact, more hours are least likely to produce better outcomes when understanding or creativity is involved. Anderson and his associates found that when children are taught to read by focusing on the meaning of the text (rather than primarily on phonetic skills), their learning does \"not depend on amount of instructional time.\" In math, too, as another group of researchers discovered, time on task is directly correlated to achievement only if both the activity and the outcome measure are focused on rote recall as opposed to problem solving.\n \n Carole Ames of Michigan State University points out that it isn't \"quantitative changes in behavior\" - such as requiring students to spend more hours in front of books or worksheets - that help children learn better. Rather, it's \"qualitative changes in the ways students view themselves in relation to the task, engage in the process of learning, and then respond to the learning activities and situation.\" In turn, these attitudes and responses emerge from the way teachers think about learning and, as a result, how they organize their classrooms. Assigning homework is unlikely to have a positive effect on any of these variables. We might say that education is less about how much the teacher covers than about what students can be helped to discover - and more time won't help to bring about that shift.\n \n Alongside an overemphasis on time is the widely held belief that homework \"reinforces\" the skills that students have learned - or, rather, have been taught -- in class. But what exactly does this mean? It wouldn't make sense to say \"Keep practicing until you understand\" because practicing doesn't create understanding - just as giving kids a deadline doesn't teach time-management skills. What might make sense is to say \"Keep practicing until what you're doing becomes automatic.\" But what kinds of proficiencies lend themselves to this sort of improvement?\n \n The answer is behavioral responses. Expertise in tennis requires lots of practice; it's hard to improve your swing without spending a lot of time on the court. But to cite an example like that to justify homework is an example of what philosophers call begging the question. It assumes precisely what has to be proved, which is that intellectual pursuits are like tennis.\n \n The assumption that they are analogous derives from behaviorism, which is the source of the verb \"reinforce\" as well as the basis of an attenuated view of learning. In the 1920s and '30s, when John B. Watson was formulating his theory that would come to dominate education, a much less famous researcher named William Brownell was challenging the drill-and-practice approach to mathematics that had already taken root. \"If one is to be successful in quantitative thinking, one needs a fund of meanings, not a myriad of 'automatic responses,'\" he wrote. \"Drill does not develop meanings. Repetition does not lead to understandings.\" In fact, if \"arithmetic becomes meaningful, it becomes so in spite of drill.\"\n \n Brownell's insights have been enriched by a long line of research demonstrating that the behaviorist model is, if you'll excuse the expression, deeply superficial. People spend their lives actively constructing theories about how the world works, and then reconstructing them in light of new evidence. Lots of practice can help some students get better at remembering an answer, but not to get better at - or even accustomed to -- thinking. And even when they do acquire an academic skill through practice, the way they acquire it should give us pause. As psychologist Ellen Langer has shown, \"When we drill ourselves in a certain skill so that it becomes second nature,\" we may come to perform that skill \"mindlessly,\" locking us into patterns and procedures that are less than ideal. \n \n But even if practice is sometimes useful, we're not entitled to conclude that homework of this type works for most students. It isn't of any use for those who don't understand what they're doing. Such homework makes them feel stupid; gets them accustomed to doing things the wrong way (because what's really \"reinforced\" are mistaken assumptions); and teaches them to conceal what they don't know. At the same time, other students in the same class already have the skill down cold, so further practice for them is a waste of time. You've got some kids, then, who don't need the practice and others who can't use it.\n \n Furthermore, even if practice was helpful for most students, that doesn't mean they need to do it at home. In my research I found a number of superb teachers (at different grade levels and with diverse instructional styles) who rarely, if ever, found it necessary to assign homework. Some not only didn't feel a need to make students read, write, or do math at home; they preferred to have students do these things during class where it was possible to observe, guide, and discuss.\n \n Finally, any theoretical benefit of practice homework must be weighed against the effect it has on students' interest in learning. If slogging through worksheets dampens one's desire to read or think, surely that wouldn't be worth an incremental improvement in skills. And when an activity feels like drudgery, the quality of learning tends to suffer, too. That so many children regard homework as something to finish as quickly as possible - or even as a significant source of stress -- helps to explain why it appears not to offer any academic advantage even for those who obediently sit down and complete the tasks they've been assigned. All that research showing little value to homework may not be so surprising after all.\n \n Supporters of homework rarely look at things from the student's point of view, though; instead, kids are regarded as inert objects to be acted on: Make them practice and they'll get better. My argument isn't just that this viewpoint is disrespectful, or that it's a residue of an outdated stimulus-response psychology. I'm also suggesting it's counterproductive. Children cannot be made to acquire skills. They aren't vending machines such that we put in more homework and get out more learning.\n \n But just such misconceptions are pervasive in all sorts of neighborhoods, and they're held by parents, teachers, and researchers alike. It's these beliefs that make it so hard even to question the policy of assigning regular homework. We can be shown the paucity of supporting evidence and it won't have any impact if we're wedded to folk wisdom (\"practice makes perfect\"; more time equals better results). \n \n On the other hand, the more we learn about learning, the more willing we may be to challenge the idea that homework has to be part of schooling. \n\n \n \n http://www.alfiekohn.org/teaching/edweek/homework.htm\n \n Interesting...",

   "Students wouldn't feel overworked if they managed to budget their time more effectively. The average volume of homework being assigned in the United States is increasing, but it is by no means unmanageable by students who plan ahead. I find my classmates struggle with their homework because they're attempting to do more than they can handle. This is likely attributable to my location more than anything, but school sports take up more time than homework. My school's soccer or hockey team may not return home until 7 or 8pm after an hour long trip, a match, and an hour long return. Homework on the other hand does not require four or five hours of work a night if uninterrupted and if longer assignments are spread out over the course of the week. If high school students feel they are too busy to complete homework for all their classes, they may do better to drop other activities or take less demanding courses.\n \n That is not to say I agree with teachers assigning large amounts of homework, I am merely trying to show that homework does not take up extensive amounts of time, most students simply prioritize other activities thus decreasing the amount of time they can allocate for homework. High school students are not overworked. I am taking four weighted courses this semester, three of which are AP classes I've been taking since the beginning of the year. I receive a significant amount of homework each night compared to my classmates, but because I've prioritized my homework and studying over other activities, I've encountered no problems keeping up with homework or the class. I play golf by myself to avoid unnecessarily long team trips and still have plenty of time left over for on-line activities and teaching myself Korean. To suggest the work unmanageable is ludicrous, I think it would be more accurate to say that many students choose not to manage their homework as effectively as they could if they considered it a priority.\n \n I value homework as it increases my ability to learn the material. I find I get more out of spending half an hour on calculus work than taking the actual class. In the classroom one learns, homework is a way in which to encourage practice and more efficiently drill concepts and equations into one's head. The class is necessary for providing the means to tackle the equations, but unless more time can be provided for practice in school, homework is the best alternative for providing that opportunity, at least for people who learn better through experimentation and experience more than through listening to explanations.\n \n How beneficial homework is to the majority of students is easily debatable, but students who are focused on learning as much as they can through their work are less likely to encounter difficulty meetings their teacher's demands. Many people who may need to practice a new learned concept would not if it was not required, this is why homework is required. The idea is that it further cements new information into students' heads more effectively than leaving them to their own devices. I am biased because I find homework immensely useful to my learning, but a system in which students could further practice or learn information solely by their own accord would, for the majority, prove less beneficial than forced assignments related to the topic.\n \n \nAlso, has anyone else ever wondered why teens commit the highest number of suicides?\nThat could be due to a variety of reasons, from trouble adjusting to the demands of adulthood to severe harassment to the lack of acceptance for one's sexual orientation. I would be very interested in a study attempting to determine whether there is a correlation between large amounts of homework and teen suicide, but there are a huge number of factors which would need to be accounted for.",

I just got done with 4 1/2 years of engineering school. Try taking ever single test you take (thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and advanced math) on a curve with brainic workaholics who are hellbent on beating the curve. \n \n Try graduating and figuring out what to do with your life and in a hurry while you're digging deeper into the loans.\n \n I agree with E Mutz that we are the masters of our lives and our level of stress is more or less self-induced. I know this because I used to be stressed all the time - then took a deep breath and a bigger picture - exhaled - and feel much much better. \n \n On a different but relevant note, I feel homework is given too much weight in university as well.

   "I have to disagree with you again here. Let's examine the conditions you have set up: School grades are A, B, C, D, F. If it's the same as when I was in school, you can pass with anything other than an F. In a job, you either get fired or stay, which is a pass / fail system (or P / F). With school grades, you have an 80% chance of passing and a 20% chance of failing. With a P/F system, you have a 50% of either passing or failing. So, how would the grading method with a higher chance of success and a lower chance of failure be more stressful?\n\n \n Wrong, wrong, wrong. Just because there are 5 outcomes does not make them all equally likely. The only way it would do is if they were norm referenced to make sure 20% of students got each grade. Trying to assign numerical values to the chances of keeping a job is hard, it does not make any sense to claim that you have a 50% chance of losing a job. Apart from anything else, what sort of timescale are we talking about? I day? 1 year? 50 years?\n \n Apologies for the rant, trainee maths teacher, I had to stamp out this misconception with my year 8s this morning.",

We do dread going to school every morning, I don't know 1 kid that doesn't.\n\n \n Well, as I have said before, your level of stress is up to you. However, adults have many more responsibilities than kids do, thus their lives can certainly be considered more stressful (or at least there is more opportunity to be stressed). No offense, but you aren't an adult, and you haven't been out in the real world. Just because you choose a job doesn't mean you wake up every single morning and want to go to work. Either you are exaggerating by saying that every kid dreads going to scool every morning, or there are a lot of kids in need of a shrink. I mean, come on...what if there is some hot chick in one of your classes that you really like? You wouldn't be eager to go to school for that? That is really sad.\n \n I'd also like to add that a lot of your level of responsibility and/or stress is directly related to the choices you make. Generally speaking, you take on those responsibilities for some type of reward later on. This is why people who want to be successful strive to get good grades in school and take difficult classes. However, it isn't like it ends with good grades. Just because you get straight As in school doesn't mean you are just going to be handed a cake job and a fat paycheck without any type of effort. You will be working hard throughout your whole life, and the amount of responsibilities grow. Eventually, you will probably be faced with raising a kid (or kids) of your own.

Dont get me wrong, i actually quiet enjoyed high school, being a teenager however ... emotional roller coaster!\n \n My perception is not that teenagers are dealt a more stressful lifestyle, its simply that teenagers do not yet posses the maturity, hormonal stability and life experience to handle the stress. This is the problem.\n The overburdening of teenagers with what may simply be declared \"normal\" stress in an adult world is exasperated by the under developed psychological aspects of youth.\n \n 6 years on and entering a law degree i believe i am far greater prepared to handle the enormous amounts of stress this academic venture will prevail. Its also undeniable this chapter will pose a far greater level of stress than any year of high-school.\n As an adult we have a far greater ability to delegate, deal and manage our stress. As a teenager it is simply trial and much error coined with the instability of our raging hormones.\n \n As someone mentioned earlier being a teenager majestically sucks! Does this mean its the most stressful period in a life cycle? no it does not, but it does suck more than the rest.\n \n On the topic at hand, yes there is far to much emphasis on homework in the academic system, especially elementary and high school years. One should not forget that social development is actually rated of far more importance in elementary years than academic success. Without proper social skills academia is futile. Helping teenagers to develop/encourage their own independent thirst for knowledge has far more benefit in the future than the forced instruction to do so.",

Type A - Driven by my own expectations and desires. No one to blame but myself.\n \n Looking back at school, I have no desire to go back and did not want to relive it through my kids going there. I did however identify with the fellow that mentioned the fact of girls being there. :)\n \n I think its just a matter of perspective. You want to be rich or a straight A student, then deal with the stress. I made the choice to live a peaceful life, but I too am type-A. So I have to put all this stress back into perspective, on a regular basis. \n \n I never did do homework though. My type-A revolved around girls and I was such a loser. Imagine the frustration there. :)",

You won't always have a teacher to quiz for your answers.\n \n And one other thing . . . you sit completely lost for half an hour. I used to get a couple of hours every night (which I do admit was pretty sh**ty).\n \n And why do you think you should not get into trouble for not doing as you were asked? You will be asked to do many things throughout your life that you don't feel like doing. It's only fair in that everyone will go through it, so get used to it.",
