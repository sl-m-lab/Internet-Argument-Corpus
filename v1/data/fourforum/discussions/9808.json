   "Nine more US soldiers killed yesterday in one attack. 85 or more killed just this month alone.\n \n I have family over there, and I understand that any deaths are a trajedy; however, there is no reason to complain about the number of deaths in Iraq. Vietnam experienced over 85 or more deaths in a week or less; this is much worse than our current position.\n \n situation is no better today. Actually it is worse.\n \n How many people did Saddam Hussein murder? Also, it is the stragglers of his supporters and terrorists that are attacking civilians. If we leave, these attacks will not decrease, they would increase without fear of retaliation.\n \n They don't want us there.\n \n Thats what the media tells you. Like I said, I have friends and family members who have been in Iraq, and every one of them tells some story of how many people rejoice and celebrate at the sight of an American soldier, threatening their own lives to protect the citizenry.\n \n Bring the troops home.\n \n If we get out, more problems will be faced. Terrorists/insurgents from Iran and other areas would flock into the area, causing more pointless death than their is currently. Also, we, the US citizens, will be seen as cowards that don't even have the mettle to continue through the conflicts end. This will lower our influence in global affairs, that could result in further disaster to not only our economy, but aggressor nations will not take us seriously either. And do you know what happens when an aggressor thinks that a power won't retaliate to it? It happened in the 1930s, Hitler didn't take the Western powers seriously, and much blood was shed. It happened on 9/11. The terrorrists did not take us seriously, and do you want to prove them right? I don't know if we should have invaded originally or not, I'll admit that. But don't tell me that their situation has gotten worse. And don't tell me that we should pull out. If that happens, all those deaths you complain about will be for nothing. The brave troops that fell deserve better than for the country for which they died half-:xcensored the job and take the easy way out. I don't care if you support the war or not, thats your opinion. But, please, I ask you, support the troops, especially the ones that gave their lives to liberate Iraq. Don't dishonor them by advocating leaving and making their sacrifice a moot point.",

When I asked \"How many people did Saddam murder?\" it was a genuine question. Based on what I have heard, the situation has in fact improved (Also, I don't trust media on such issues, no media is unbiased). My main point was that if we do pull out now, as the protestors wish, the Middle East situation will grow worse. When we finally got out of Vietnam (as the protestors wished), the North Vietnamese went back on their agreement and invaded the South. When the president tried to re-enter us in the conflict, Congress, with their political agenda, denied it and left S. Vietnam to rot. I personnally consider this a failure and do not want a similar occurence to happen again. I'm not sure of the numbers, but again it seems that a vocal minority is again winning many people from a silent majority. My point was if we pull out, the consequences are worse than those of seeing the conflict through its entirity (to keep it from \"disintigrating\")",

   "just your reference to treason being an archaic idea. Is treason even an offence in the US?\n\n \n Here's an interesting article that deals with the question of modern day treason in the USA in regard to the War on Terror. Here's page one in case you can't access it.\n \n Time of Treason\n New York Sun Editorial\n October 13, 2006\n \n Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States. -18 U.S.C. 2381\n \n The Justice Department's announcement that it has obtained an indictment for treason against Adam Gadahn ups the ante on the legal front of the war against terror. The move is a long overdue warning for any frivolous American youths who are tempted to join the war against their country. Treason is not child's play. It's a deadly serious matter for the country, the traitor's fellow citizens, and, now, for the traitor himself.\n \n The definition of treason has changed over the centuries, but it has always been intended to include that species of crime that destabilizes not just a family or a neighborhood or even a city but the entire country. One of the earliest treason statutes in the English tradition was enacted during the reign of Edward III and proscribed, among other things, levying war against the king and adhering to and aiding and comforting his foreign enemies, precepts that found their way virtually unchanged into the American Constitution.\n \n By its nature, there has always been a political nature to treason, and its prosecution at times became highly politicized in English history. Even so, revulsion at treason could \"cross party lines.\" William Blackstone recounted in his 1769 commentary on English law that Edward IV had prosecuted treasons committed against his predecessor, Henry VI, during the Wars of the Roses even though Edward IV denied the legitimacy of Henry VI's claim to the throne.\n \n Blackstone noted that treason statutes considered only the actual occupant of the throne even if someone else technically had a better claim and deserved to be king instead. Although the concept of a \"loyal opposition\" wouldn't develop in its modern form until not long before Blackstone's own day, Englishmen had long held that, to the extent dissent was permissible, it should only be voiced in the context of the normal political process and not in armed rebellion. Treason is very different from mere dissent.\n \n The founders of America grasped the way in which treason was subject to abuse. So they prohibited Congress from defining it in any way other than levying war against the United States or adhering to its enemies, giving them aid and comfort. They prohibited the authorities from taking a confession anywhere but in open court and, absent that, prohibited the courts from bringing in a conviction save on the testimony of two witnesses to an overt act, and they insisted that the two witnesses had to have seen the same overt act.\n \n Continued\n 1 | 2 | Next >>\n \n \n http://www.nysun.com/article/41533",

Because regardless of what may happen there militarily, the political situaiton is about as bad as could possibly have been imagined. THE DAWA PARTY IS RUNNING IRAQ. That would be the same Dawa party that is funded by and wholly controlled by Tehran. IRAN NOW OWNS IRAQ. What we are fighting for is to ensure that control. \n \n People seem mystified when they see IRan flexing thier muscles now. Iraq was the sole counter to Iranian influence in the ME and not only did we remove that stumbling block, we handed it over to Iran. We essentially handed the entire ME over to Iran.\n \n Victory??? We were defeated the day the Iraqi votes were counted and they elected leaders who were pro iranian. Everything from that point on has been nothing but an attempt to save face and to influence the iraqi people after the fact.

   "First off, you're absolutely right, I should be using the word \"I\" to describe my thoughts and feelings on the subject and furthermore if I do use the pronoun \"WE\" I should atleast qualify that with who it is I claim to be speaking for. Resolved.\n \n Secondly : //\"Agree 100%. A soldier dying is alike a fart in the wind. It means nothing. That is what soldiers are for. We have a voluntary military so our soldier signed up. They volunteered. If they get killed, that is just life.\"// Then we are Agreed and Resolved on that issue if thats what you really believe. \n \n \n Now to claify some issues:\n \n 1. //\"Saddam was on Al Quedas hit list, too.\"// Sources please. Also keep in mind that there may be lots of people on Al Quedas list. There are many factions in Islam and just because one man is on one factions list doesn't make him any less a fundamentalist. \n 2. //\" Iraq was a secular country. Saddam Hussein was considered an \"enemy of islam\" by the islamic fundamentalists.\"// Again sources are a must. Iraq's national flag has \"Allah Akbar\" inscribed on it in arabic. I have a hard time believing, prima facie, that they considered themselves \"secular\" even though the bathist/socialists did supress Islam to some degree while Sadam was in power. I will leave it up to you to show me that that degree was to such an extent that a reasonable person would consider them \"secular.\" Citing to me the repression and neglect of the shias in the south and the out right hostilities against the kurds in the north is in my mind an example of how un-\"secular\" Sadam was. I view a lot of this as sectarian strife between the shia, sunni, and the kurds. Sadam, his family and indeed the culture at that time was anything but secular. While the same old rules and barbaric underpinnings applied and were present, they were merely glossed over (and thus prolonged) by a thin socialist crust. For more information on other instances of sectarianism under sadams rule, look at the persecution of native christian peoples living in Iraq. \n 3.//\"Those ...islamic fundamentalists now know that if they attack us, we will spend a trillion + dollars to make them stronger than ever.\"// This is immaterial to me. Obviously, our attacks have emboldened them if thats what you're getting at. I don't care. My point is that its time to kill them and settle this, not worry about how we're going to stir them up or hurt their delicate sensibilites. \n 4.//\"I hate to burst your bubble of rightous idignation, but if we wanted to take revenge on the muslims by invading a country, Iraq would be about the worst choice possible.\"// On this we can agree. Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia would have made a great starting places too. However, don't worry, my \"bubble of rightous [indignation]\" has not been burst. I'm confident we'll get to these places in due time. Iraq and Afganistan are decent starters though.\n 5.//\"Not in Bin Ladens wildest wet dreams could he possibly have even hoped to have made such massive advances in his goal...especially not thanks to uncle sam.\"// You need to prove that Bin Laden really feels this way about his new tactical situation unless you're willing to acknowledge that this is just speculation on your part. No matter how that's resolved, I feel that we should be doing more; not limiting ourselves to just Iraq and Afganistan so I tend to agree with you that there's a problem but obviously we're going to differ on the nature of that problem, it's level of threat to us and how to take care of it.\n \n \n Many of the criticisms in your post glance off of my main point- this is about REVENGE. I really don't care that you think im ignorant - I dont have to be told that, I know it's true. I don't care that you think I'm self righteous or indignant - In my mind I have good reasons for feeling that way. What needs to be addressed in my mind, is this idea of revenge and our motivations for fighting this war. Many of us (if you want names I can give them to you - and by \"us\" I mean junior guys who I served with in my various units who joined up after 9/11) joined up for revenge and to teach a lesson to what we percieved to be conspirators and perpatrators in an already rising tide of anti-western sentiment among Muslims living in the middle east. In our minds this lesson has been DILUTED by talk of \"rebuilding\" (a pretensious little word which basically translates into non-phony language as \"conquest), and stabilization (meaning misguided attempts to put systems of government and leaders into place that are usually hated and despised by the vast majority of the people). We shouldn't be there in this capacity - we should be there soley as unabashed killers and conquerors. Look, the Muslim holy leaders constantly preach jihad and martyrdom to the masses. The Masses eat it up. Wouldn't we be giving a vile and backwards civilization exactly what it wanted - An honorable way to self destruct? These Muslims are hopeless. Torn apart by endless sectarian strife even on good years, their holiest text is a convoluted mess, which sounds frankly as though it were written by somebody with Bi-polar disorder. I am not waiting around 800 years for a muslim messiah. They wanted and started a holy war, and now WE will end what they started with their inevitable dissolution as a somewhat coherent civilization. They made the wine, now they can drink the cup. We need to end this now. Declare war, bomb them back to the stone age, split up their lands between India, China, and us and let the pesky names of Allah and his prophet slip from our minds forever. \n \n \n P.S. - I would be interested to know what branch of service your were in and what your MOS was and what your motivations were for joining? Did you join before or after 9/11?",

For more information on other instances of sectarianism under sadams rule, look at the persecution of native christian peoples living in Iraq. \n\n \n I combined those two because they are similar:\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/14/AR2006091401545.html\n \n \nThe CIA learned in late September 2002 from a high-level member of Saddam Hussein's inner circle that Iraq had no past or present contact with Osama bin Laden and that the Iraqi leader considered bin Laden an enemy of the Baghdad regime, according to a recent Senate Intelligence Committee report.\n\n \n http://www.cato.org/dailys/03-05-03.html\n \n \nLast summer, when CNN acquired a cache of internal Al Qaeda training videotapes, they discovered a Qaeda documentary that was highly critical of Hussein. Peter Bergen, the CNN terrorism expert who interviewed Bin Laden in 1998, noted that Bin Laden indicted Hussein, as \"a bad Muslim.\" \n \n That theme continues in the latest \"Bin Laden\" audiotape, released to Al Jazeera. In it, Bin Laden (or someone claiming to be him) urges Muslims to fight the American \"crusaders\" bent on invading Iraq. But even while urging assistance to Hussein's \"socialist\" regime, \"Bin Laden\" can't resist condemning that regime: \"The jurisdiction of the socialists and those rulers has fallen a long time ago .... Socialists are infidels wherever they are, whether they are in Baghdad or Aden.\"\n\n \n Baathists are not just socialists. Bathism is an extreme form of secular facism. Bin Ladenns goal for the ME is to restore a caliphate with Baghdad as its capitol. A caliphate is ruled by a religous leader. His caliphate would look pretty stupid on a map with an iraq shaped cutout in the middle of it, and it seems unlikely that he would be able to convince teh secular fascist to hand over baghdad as its capitol especially since, as I showed above, he and Saddam were enemies.\n \n http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/09/20060905-4.html\n \n \nThey hope to establish a violent political utopia across the Middle East, which they call a \"Caliphate\" -- where all would be ruled according to their hateful ideology. Osama bin Laden has called the 9/11 attacks -- in his words -- \"a great step towards the unity of Muslims and establishing the Righteous... [Caliphate].\"\n \n This caliphate would be a totalitarian Islamic empire encompassing all current and former Muslim lands, stretching from Europe to North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. We know this because al Qaeda has told us. About two months ago, the terrorist Zawahiri -- he's al Qaeda's second in command -- declared that al Qaeda intends to impose its rule in \"every land that was a home for Islam, from [Spain] to Iraq. He went on to say, \"The whole world is an open field for us.\" \n\n \n \nThis is immaterial to me. Obviously, our attacks have emboldened them if thats what you're getting at. I don't care. My point is that its time to kill them and settle this, not worry about how we're going to stir them up or hurt their delicate sensibilites. \n\n \n I am not talking about emboldening them. I am talking about handing over Iraq to them. I am talking about the fact that since our ill fated invasion of Iraw AQ is more than twice as big and has nearly 5 times th money they did prior to the invasion. \n \n Time has a pretty good article about AQs explosive growth since the invasion of Iraq at:\n \n http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,642825,00.html\n \n The invasion of Iraq has been the ultimate recruiting tool for AQ and has strengthened their hold over the ME. \n \n \nOn this we can agree. Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia would have made a great starting places too. However, don't worry, my \"bubble of rightous [indignation]\" has not been burst. I'm confident we'll get to these places in due time. Iraq and Afganistan are decent starters though.\n\n \n LOL. We cannot even provide a stable Iraq because while we have the meanest military on the planet when it comes to an invasion, we are not worth a damn at occupation. We can bomb anything, anywhere, any time, but the vast majority of our troops SUCK on the ground in the towns where it matters. \n \n Iraq was an 8th tier nation. Can you imagine what an invasion and subsequent occupation of Iran would look like? Saudi Arabia will no longer allow us to use our bases there. We would have to stage the attack form Iraq, and Iran has MORE than enough ballistic missiles to take out every US base in Iraq. We could take out half of their missiles first (if we knew where they were) and they would STILL have enough to wipe out every US base in Iraq and large segments of israel to boot. \n \n We built a military that is GREAT at destroying things, but sucks at waging war. For years military leaders have been complaining that we lack the ground resources to win a war. Now it has been proven. Politicians like neat planes and cruise missiles. \n \n \nYou need to prove that Bin Laden really feels this way about his new tactical situation unless you're willing to acknowledge that this is just speculation on your part. No matter how that's resolved, I feel that we should be doing more; not limiting ourselves to just Iraq and Afganistan so I tend to agree with you that there's a problem but obviously we're going to differ on the nature of that problem, it's level of threat to us and how to take care of it.\n\n \n Bin Ladens primary goal is a caliphate in the middle east with Baghdad as its capitol. Now, thanks to the US, Iraq, including baghdad, is under the control of religous fundamentalists. \n \n \n Many of the criticisms in your post glance off of my main point- this is about REVENGE. I really don't care that you think im ignorant - I dont have to be told that, I know it's true. I don't care that you think I'm self righteous or indignant - In my mind I have good reasons for feeling that way.

We need to end this now. Declare war, bomb them back to the stone age, split up their lands between India, China, and us and let the pesky names of Allah and his prophet slip from our minds forever. \n\n \n Then maybe you need to go out and actually learn a little about the enemy and what is going on before you decide to go off on a crusade of revenge. All we have managed to do in Iraq is kill a half a million innocent people who had NOTHING to do with attacking the US and we have strengthened our real enemy. \n \n Frankly, if youa re truly in this for revenge, and believe that the war in IRaq is justified as revenge, not only are you an ignorant fool, you are an absolute disgrace to your uniform. Fortunatly for the rest of the world, your kind will not be tolerated in our military for long. You inevitably end up being either drummed out by those who are still honorable, killed by your fellow soldiers, or you will commit a war crime and end up in leavenworth. \n \n Your attitude is part of the reason that we are having so much trouble coming up with qualified officers. Those of the old guard want nothing to do with you and nobody with any brains is willing to jump into this idiotic \"revenge\" war where we take \"revenge\" on people who are completely unconnected to the events we are seeking revenge for. That is not \"revenge\". That is just blood lust and it is never tolerated for long. If to you this is a war of revenge then you are worse than Bin Laden. Bin Laden also seeks revenge, but he at leasts restricts it to those that he percieves as having committed the offense that he seeks revenge for. You, on the other hand, are apparently just killing randomly as \"revenge\". \n \n \nP.S. - I would be interested to know what branch of service your were in and what your MOS was and what your motivations were for joining? Did you join before or after 9/11?\n\n \n Army. 18A. I joined because I was considering the possibility of a later career in politics and the voters like to see some military experience. 18A because what I specifically needed was a security clearance and combat, and there are only 2 places in the entire military you can be assured of combay without spending years waiting for it. \n \n I had been out for some time by the time 9/11 came along and all this idiocy broke loose. That was back int he old days when we actually fought terrorism. 6 man teams in under cover of darkness. Kill or capture the bad guy and then get out. Now we invade the entire freaking country, the bad guys all get away, and then we invade another country that is totally unrelated and where there are not even any targets. \n \n I am not saying that invading Afghanistan was necessarily a bad thing. What shocked me was the complete idiocy involved in not getting the bad guy (Bin Laden). Getting the bad guy and then invading the country would have worked much better. \n \n Prior to the war in Afghanistan, I called a member of my former unit to tell him \"good luck\". I assumed that they would be in afghanistan prior to the actual war starting to...you know....get the bad guys. I was shocked when he said \"we are not going\". I was even more shocked when he told me \"nobody is going\". ###???? The odds of us capturing Bin Laden in an invasion was ZERO. There was simply no possible way it could be done. He has been operating there since the soviets and we knew full well he had a complete CIA designed network including multiple hardened escape routes. \n \n That is when I realized that the \"war on terror\" probably had little or nothing to do with terror. IF you start the war by intentionally NOT capturing the head terrorist, there is no way you are fighting a war on terror. Aq did not have that many facilities in Afghanistan, and we knew where all of them were. 5 teams in and in 2 weeks BL would have been either dead or sitting in a federal prison here in the states awaiting trial. That would have been a sure thing. In an invasion scenario, BL escaping was the only sure thing.\n \n Since the goal of the war is obviously NOT to combat terror, what is it? You say it is revenge, but as has been shown clearly, there is no \"revenge\" here. Revenge is somethign you take on the people who you percieve as having wronged you. Not in anybodies wildest dreams can Iraq fall into that category in relation to terror.\n \n The only conclusion that I can draw is that the goal is perpetual warfare. We intentionally let BL escape by excuting the campaign in a manner that we knew absolutly would result in his escape. Then we invade Iraq, which anybody with even half a brain recognized was in no way related to the war on terror, and which that same halfwit should easily have been able to recognize would inflame much of the world and result in a strengthening of our enemies. I don't think that a lot of people (myself included) recognized how humilitaing the Iraqi experience would be (I expected the utter failure, but not the disgraceful, dishonorable war crimes commited by our troops).",

His caliphate would look pretty stupid on a map with an iraq shaped cutout in the middle of it, and it seems unlikely that he would be able to convince teh secular fascist to hand over baghdad as its capitol especially since, as I showed above, he and Saddam were enemies.\n\n \n Thank you for citing sources- I have no problem with them; interesting you quoted from the Cato institute.\n \n Now to begin, I already acknowledged that Sadam not only supressed Islam in Iraq while he was in power but that he was also probably decried by other radical fundamentalists in other sects of Islam. The problem I see you having is trying to prove that he ACTED secular and imposed his secularism on Iraq while in control to such a degree that he himself, his regime and indeed the people of Iraq are not deserving of having their country turned into Dresden circa February 1945. The people of Iraq openly supported strong anti-western sentiments, and they openly supported Jihad on the west. Like I already stated, they rattled their sabres too hard. They started this thing. Muslims danced in the streets openly when the news that the towers had fallen hit the world media outlets. They wanted jihad, and now we are fufilling their greatest wishes- their wives and husbands and grandmothers and grandfathers and little sons and daughters are paying the price - on a daily basis. The beautiful thing is - we aren't even doing most of the killing. They're doing it to themselves. Iraq is literally ripping itself apart from the inside. Its a case of divide and slaughter. We cut off the head of the chicken and watch, laughing, as it scurrys frantically around the barnyard. What better, more poetic justice than to subvert the very culture, the very concept of jihad so that they wage it against ONE ANOTHER? No better revenge. For now that is.\n \n \n \nI am not talking about emboldening them. I am talking about handing over Iraq to them. I am talking about the fact that since our ill fated invasion of Iraw AQ is more than twice as big and has nearly 5 times th money they did prior to the invasion.\n\n \n I could not agree more. Instead of lying to ourselves and being phony, we need to acknowledge what this is really about, make a plan and then execute. They wanted jihad and went too far (although you could argue they went too far long ago) and now we want revenge. We unabashedly declare our intentions and reap a human crop that will teach the world and what little mulisms remain alive in it that we mean business when we say we do not tolerate acts of terrorism and aggression against civilian targets. I could care less that the pentagon or the white house was hit. They're politicians and high ranking military functionaries who should be willing to accept the high level of danger that goes hand in hand with their jobs and the absurd level of power they have over regular american citizens. But to strike at CIVILIAN targets like the world trade center? UNFORGIVABLE.\n \n \nLOL. We cannot even provide a stable Iraq because while we have the meanest military on the planet when it comes to an invasion, we are not worth a damn at occupation. We can bomb anything, anywhere, any time, but the vast majority of our troops SUCK on the ground in the towns where it matters.\n\n \n Again, I don't care that we cant provide a stable Iraq. I too think its a laughable, missguided enterprise. I dont WANT there to be a stable Iraq. \n \n \nIraq was an 8th tier nation. Can you imagine what an invasion and subsequent occupation of Iran would look like? Saudi Arabia will no longer allow us to use our bases there. We would have to stage the attack form Iraq, and Iran has MORE than enough ballistic missiles to take out every US base in Iraq. We could take out half of their missiles first (if we knew where they were) and they would STILL have enough to wipe out every US base in Iraq and large segments of israel to boot.\n\n \n This is an interesting, albeit irrelevant topic. I would love to argue in another context about the feasibility of attacking Iran and Syria and the rest of them. However, where we would differ is on our motives for discussing such a scenario. I would use it as grounds for improving our capabilities to include such a mission whereas I'm assuming you wouldn't want to support such a mission at all. \n \n \nWe built a military that is GREAT at destroying things, but sucks at waging war. For years military leaders have been complaining that we lack the ground resources to win a war. Now it has been proven. Politicians like neat planes and cruise missiles. \n\n \n Brother, again let me clarify, we may or may not lack the ground resources to win a war of stability and support operations but thats not the war I want at all. I totally agree, we do lack the ground resources to win such a war. In fact, such a war without the support of the populace is unwinable. But my point is that we should be killing this populace without mercy since it is they who wanted a total war of jihad in the first place. In such a war we would CRUSH them, rest assured brother.\n \n \n \nThen maybe you need to go out and actually learn a little about the enemy and what is going on before you decide to go off on a crusade of revenge. All we have managed to do in Iraq is kill a half a million innocent people who had NOTHING to do with attacking the US and we have strengthened our real enemy.\n\n \n I was very much alive when I watched Muslims in the middleeast and in indonesia dancing in the streets when they found out the towers had fallen and all OUR innocents had been killed. I was very much alive when, much earlier when I was a child, my father told me about the Iran hostage crisis, the Munich Olympics incident and the various plane hijackings perpetrated on innocent people by Muslim \"fundementalists.\" Innocent people killed because the terrorists were trying to send a message to washington politicians about Israel. This goes to the crux of the matter - HOW CULPABLE ARE THE MUSLIM PEOPLE AS A WHOLE of the crimes that their religious, political, military and paramilitary leaders commission or allow to happen through intentional inaction. I believe they are GUILTY as hell and I will endeavor to prove it to you over the course of the next few days. They are linked by INTENTIONAL, PREMEDITATED bonds of support, even BROTHERHOOD with their Political, Military and espescially RELIGIOUS leaders to crimes against the western world for which no \"sorry\" will solve and for which there is no form of redress.\n \n \nFrankly, if youa re truly in this for revenge, and believe that the war in IRaq is justified as revenge, not only are you an ignorant fool, you are an absolute disgrace to your uniform. Fortunatly for the rest of the world, your kind will not be tolerated in our military for long. You inevitably end up being either drummed out by those who are still honorable, killed by your fellow soldiers, or you will commit a war crime and end up in leavenworth.\n \n \n Again, I acknowledge that not only am I ignorant, but that I am also a fool as any human being on this planet would be wise to admit. However, even this ignorant fool can see that there can be no and should be no peace between the western world and Islam. All out war will only be postponed to our detriment. \n \n \nYour attitude is part of the reason that we are having so much trouble coming up with qualified officers. Those of the old guard want nothing to do with you and nobody with any brains is willing to jump into this idiotic \"revenge\" war where we take \"revenge\" on people who are completely unconnected to the events we are seeking revenge for. That is not \"revenge\". That is just blood lust and it is never tolerated for long. If to you this is a war of revenge then you are worse than Bin Laden. Bin Laden also seeks revenge, but he at leasts restricts it to those that he percieves as having committed the offense that he seeks revenge for. You, on the other hand, are apparently just killing randomly as \"revenge\". \n\n \n Is it unfortunate that you, our elders and senior brothers, see us as unqualified disgraces and yourselves as distant from us in this way. We respect your experience and your intelligence. Even though you were in a different branch of service from myself, I feel a bond with ANY infantryman from any branch of service, whether they be 0311, 0331, '41, 11B even 11Mikes. You have to understand that we joined AFTER 9/11 for a purpose that was tempered, for many of us in the MARINES in the fire fights and IED explosions that claimed so many of my fellow Marines lives and limbs. Many of us, no matter the battalion we served in, had to endure 3 COMBAT TOURS. We have seen how few \"Innocents\" there really are. Frankly Brother, WE have become the new oldschool now. We are defined by REAL combat tours in a very real, hostile environment where we deal with these so-called innocents on a day to day basis. This is not bloodlust speaking. This is 4 years and 3 combat tours worth of experience telling you - WAR and resolution is coming. The only way you're going to convince your army brothers and your older, stronger, meaner Marine cousins to stop joining up, is to somehow unlink the bonds that connect the vast majority of guilty-as-sin Muslims from their psychotic, jihad loving leaders. Good luck on that. In the meantime, I'll be posting here with as many old links detailing the conduct of everyday muslims and their complicity and support of terrorism against the west.\n \n Sincerely,\n \n Tanstaafl07",

   "\n 1. I would suggest you take a look at some of my past posts. I have not changed my position on the Iraq war at all. What has happened in Iraq is EXACTLY what I and many others predicted before we even went in. The result in Iraq was never in question. The outcome we got was the only possibility from the start. \n 2. I would suggest you check the polls on that. Even before Iraq became a cesspool of sectarian violence and crime most Iraqis hated us.\n 3. The idea that what you are championing here is a better life for the Iraqi people is an insult to the Iraqi people. Currently, we are in Iraq fighting so that the Islamic fundamentalist government that is running death squads out of their security ministry. The people we are killing are the ones who are fighting the Islamic totalitarians running the place. \n 4. At least be honest enough to admit that you do not give a rats XXX about the Iraqi people. If you did, you would not be supporting our drive to place them in the iron grip of an Iranian controlled totalitarian government. You just do not want to admit that our mission in Iraq has been a complete failure and you are willing to condem not only every Iraqi there today but many future generations to totalitarianism in order to avoid having to make that admission.\n 5. And what about conservatives? I am probably further to the right than anybody on this forum, and I think that Bush should be tossed up against the nearest wall and shot. The man has done NOTHING right for years. His immediate response to 9/11 was good. I was actually proud of him. Since then he has done more harm to this country than any single person I can think of in the last century. His foreign policy has been absolutly horrid, his economic policies have been disasterous, and his social policies have been abysmal. \n 6. Unfortunatly there seem to be a lot of delusional people out there that believe that being \"conservative\" means supporting the war mongering fiscal liberal that is in the white house merely because he has an R after his name. \n 7. You are talking about the guy who lied to get us into a trillion + dollar recreational war that resulted in handing the entire ME over to our enemies.\n \n Same guy who pushed for and passed a multi trillion dollar prescription drug benifit program that resulted in HIGHER drug costs for most seniors.\n \n 8. Same guy who appointed his buddy with no qualifications to run FEMA then tried to deflect the blame when the Katrina response was botched so badly.\n \n Same guy who has completley gutted our military.\n \n 9. You cannot POSSIBLY be a conservative and support that liberal SOB in the white house. The idea that the \"leftists\" are causing our loss in Iraq is ludicrous. YOU ARE THE LEFT. \n \n The war in Iraq was lost before it ever started. The idea that we are somehow going to \"win\" now is laughable. It simply cannot be done and there is no monday morning Quarterbacking going on. What has happened in IRaq is EXACTLY what many people, myself included, have been predicting from the start.\n\n \n 1. Mine, was actually a challenging compliment. Feeding hatred for the president really is the easy part. I agree the war is and probably was a botched effort from the start. Had the effort been supported whole heartedly \n instead of being used as a power point for election by people who actually voted for it, conveniently changing their minds and demonizing one person. Or been decried and voted against the action it may well be different. To argue that is simply arguing the unknown. \n 2. Polls? I don't have a lot of faith in them. \n 3. Actually, I do hope for a better life for Iraqis. Not defined as \"perfect\" as I don't consider that possible. But, at least with the ability to choose who leads their nation even if that choice views the U.S. with contempt. But, not being overly naive, I do confess that considering the effects of \"Islam\" on any government, that democracy is likely low on the gift list of the average Iraqi.\n 4. Wow, I didn't realize what a jerk I am. I admit one thing, I don't want to wave the white flag. Nor do I look forward to the massacre that will take place upon our departure. \n 5. I have seen your claim to conservatism prior to this thread. I do not question it. I am much farther to the right than the options available to me to support will allow me to go. I simply choose not to hate the president for making mistakes. I could, but I would simply be one more person feeding the hate without seeking solutions. I have never heard of possible options provided by anyone. Had the left or the far right offered some option other than the path the president took, and voted their conscience the beginning may have not brought the action to the condition it is in. But, most were on board with the action and turned against it when it became politically expedient, to the mis-fortune of the average Iraqi citizen. \n I don't give presidents much credit for the economics of a nation. People are working as much or more than they ever have. Life for the average American, not perfect, but far better than many citizens of the world. No one has attacked the U.S. since 9-11. Life is good. No president should get the credit for that or the blame for the opposite. \n 6. Another option? \n 7. Patience, you think you're unhappy now? 2008 will make this mess seem like a solution. \n 8. Your opinion. President Clinton, reduced the military from 16 to 10 divisions. Katrina preparation was the fault of Nagin and La. Governor. \n 9. You don't get to define me. Your attempt simply exposes your lack of respect and your pompus attitude toward any who minutely disagree with your judgments. Now, if you present a party or a leader who represents your views and others might consider supporting, your good judgment may actually have an effect. Other than spreading hate and discontent. \n If your problem solving is as astute as your ability to degrade, this nation needs you.",

What better, more poetic justice than to subvert the very culture, the very concept of jihad so that they wage it against ONE ANOTHER? No better revenge. For now that is.\n\n \n The problem here is that you have set an impossible buden of proof. Secularism in this case is essentially the lack of religous control. Proving the lack of religous control is virtually impossible without examining every law that Iraq had on the books. \n \n I still fail to see how this has anything to do with revenge for 9/11. Saddam had nothing to do with that. The Iraqi people had nothing to do with that. You may as well kill a half million people in cleveland and save the gas money it takes to get to Iraq if you are looking for revenge for 9/11. \n \n \nI could not agree more. Instead of lying to ourselves and being phony, we need to acknowledge what this is really about, make a plan and then execute. They wanted jihad and went too far (although you could argue they went too far long ago) and now we want revenge. We unabashedly declare our intentions and reap a human crop that will teach the world and what little mulisms remain alive in it that we mean business when we say we do not tolerate acts of terrorism and aggression against civilian targets. I could care less that the pentagon or the white house was hit. They're politicians and high ranking military functionaries who should be willing to accept the high level of danger that goes hand in hand with their jobs and the absurd level of power they have over regular american citizens. But to strike at CIVILIAN targets like the world trade center? UNFORGIVABLE.\n\n \n Is it unforgivable? Were those people civilians in the classic sense of the word? This is the difficult part of living in a democracy. Bin Laden is actign on a list of grievances that go back decades. US policies in the ME have resulted in the death and oppression of millions. They have been convenient for us, and we have made a LOT of money with them, but all the same there is no question that those policies...our actions, have resulted in the death and oppression of millions of people. Now those people are ######.\n \n Americans tend to point at our electedleaders and say \"the politicians did it...not US\" while failing to take responsibility for the fact that WE ELECTED those politicians and failed to keep them from actively participating in the murder and oppression of millions of people. IF it had been a short term situation...a situation where we could feasibly claim that a certain set of politicians acted in poor faith and we removed them for doing so, that would be one thing. That is not the case, though. This has been a systematic thing for several decades. \n \n That being the case, I do not think it is possible to clain that the people of the united states were not complicit in the acts. We could have stopped it at any time and chose not to. It was never a secret. We just didn't care because it was working out well for us, and if a few million arabs had to pay for it, many with their lives, it didn't matter because we found it convenient and profitable. \n \n What Bin Laden did on 9/11 was not strike at innocent civilians. He sought collectrive retrobution for a collective act. Citizens of a democracy do not have the luxury of complete disconnect from the actions of their government. For a citizen of a totalitarian nation, there is not responsibility. If the government of Iran chooses to support terrorists, the people of Iran have no voice in the matter. They do not have the option of simply voting their leaders out of office. \n \n I guess I am having trouble understanding your position here. Bin Laden hitting the WTC was dispicable, but invading Iraq and killing a buinch of Iraqis who were in no way connected was not??? Bin Laden at least limited his response to the transgressors. We are just killing randomly. How is random killing superior to targeted killing?\n \n \nAgain, I don't care that we cant provide a stable Iraq. I too think its a laughable, missguided enterprise. I dont WANT there to be a stable Iraq. \n\n \n I do not see where a stable Iraq as things stand now would benifit the US. I would just as soon walk away and let them fight it out. No matter which side emerges victorious, we are going to be dealing with an anti-Us government in Iraq. We need to get used to that fact and move on. The politicians seem to have the idea that if we can stabilize the place it will turn pro-US overnight. Sad to say, but that simply is not reality. We have killed WAY too many people there to end up with a pro-US government. \n \n \nThis is an interesting, albeit irrelevant topic. I would love to argue in another context about the feasibility of attacking Iran and Syria and the rest of them. However, where we would differ is on our motives for discussing such a scenario. I would use it as grounds for improving our capabilities to include such a mission whereas I'm assuming you wouldn't want to support such a mission at all. \n\n \n I owuld not support such a mission because it would be destined for failure. I have been in Iran. I know what they have there, and we are not going to take it with air power. A significant ground effort would be required and it woudl have to be a sustained effort. We are talking a seige. Much hs been said about Irans bunkers. They are not just C&C bunkers or storage bunkers. They fight from those bunkers, and they are impervious to our munitions. In order to win a war with Iran, we would essentially have to put those bunkers under siege and wait for them to be driven out by starvation. All the while their well structured resistance network would be picking our forces off. It would not be pretty.\n \n \nBrother, again let me clarify, we may or may not lack the ground resources to win a war of stability and support operations but thats not the war I want at all. I totally agree, we do lack the ground resources to win such a war. In fact, such a war without the support of the populace is unwinable. But my point is that we should be killing this populace without mercy since it is they who wanted a total war of jihad in the first place. In such a war we would CRUSH them, rest assured brother.\n\n \n What you are talking about here is genocide. We would never get away with it. First of all, when you embark on something like that you have essentially moved the conflict to an endgame scenario. We move to wipe every arab muslim off the planet and they have nothing to loose. They will ALL fight us. We would never survive. Not only would we be facing over a billion muslims fighting for their very survival, you are talking about open warfare on a region that supplies a good deal of the worlds oil. Look at some fo the projections that were made regarding possible war with Iran and the projected effects on world oil prices. $100 to start and $200 per barrel if they close down the strait of hormuz (which they surely would). The US could not survive tose oil prices. We woudl be detroyed.\n \n \n \nI was very much alive when I watched Muslims in the middleeast and in indonesia dancing in the streets when they found out the towers had fallen and all OUR innocents had been killed.\n \n \n But when we killed millions of THEIR innocents, it was ok?? \n \n \nI was very much alive when, much earlier when I was a child, my father told me about the Iran hostage crisis, the Munich Olympics incident and the various plane hijackings perpetrated on innocent people by Muslim \"fundementalists.\" Innocent people killed because the terrorists were trying to send a message to washington politicians about Israel. \n\n \n Complete and uttr BS. Apparently your father was as poorly informed as you are. The Iran hostage crisis was the DIRECT result of the US and the UK installing a tyrant (the shah) to rule Iran. \n \n \nThis goes to the crux of the matter - HOW CULPABLE ARE THE MUSLIM PEOPLE AS A WHOLE of the crimes that their religious, political, military and paramilitary leaders commission or allow to happen through intentional inaction. I believe they are GUILTY as hell and I will endeavor to prove it to you over the course of the next few days. They are linked by INTENTIONAL, PREMEDITATED bonds of support, even BROTHERHOOD with their Political, Military and espescially RELIGIOUS leaders to crimes against the western world for which no \"sorry\" will solve and for which there is no form of redress\n.\n \n Then you, sir, are an idiot. You seem to have this moronic misconception that we were just wandering around, minding our own business, and suddenly, out of nowhere, these lunatics attacked us. That is simply not what happened. For decades we assisted or directly participated in the oppression and murder of millions. They hit back. It was not particularly surprising. some woudl even have said it was inevitable. If you terrorize people for long enough, they eventually strike back. If you come home every night and kick your dog, that dog will eventually bite you. \n \n Are you aware of the fact that the majority of the world muslims do not live in the middle east? They are spread throughout the world and most of them have nothing to do with this. \n \n \n Again, I acknowledge that not only am I ignorant, but that I am also a fool as any human being on this planet would be wise to admit. However, even this ignorant fool can see that there can be no and should be no peace between the western world and Islam. All out war will only be postponed to our detriment. \n\n \n So to counter the \"muslim threat\" we invade a secular nation. This is beyond delusion. this is borderline insanity.\n \n \n \nIs it unfortunate that you, our elders and senior brothers, see us as unqualified disgraces and yourselves as distant from us in this way. We respect your experience and your intelligence. Even though you were in a different branch of service from myself, I feel a bond with ANY infantryman from any branch of service, whether they be 0311, 0331, '41, 11B even 11Mikes. You have to understand that we joined AFTER 9/11 for a purpose that was tempered, for many of us in the MARINES in the fire fights and IED explosions that claimed so many of my fellow Marines lives and limbs. \n Many of us, no matter the battalion we served in, had to endure 3 COMBAT TOURS. We have seen how few \"Innocents\" there really are. Frankly Brother, WE have become the new oldschool now. We are defined by REAL combat tours in a very real, hostile environment where we deal with these so-called innocents on a day to day basis. This is not bloodlust speaking. This is 4 years and 3 combat tours worth of experience telling you - WAR and resolution is coming. The only way you're going to convince your army brothers and your older, stronger, meaner Marine cousins to stop joining up, is to somehow unlink the bonds that connect the vast majority of guilty-as-sin Muslims from their psychotic, jihad loving leaders. Good luck on that. In the meantime, I'll be posting here with as many old links detailing the conduct of everyday muslims and their complicity and support of terrorism against the west.\n\n \n \n W efought with honor. You new bunch are a bunch of whiney little bitches. Oh, poor you, you had to serve 3 combat tours. You signed up knowing you were going to have to serve combat tours. The fact that you were stupid enough to join the military specifically to fight an unsupported and unjust war pretty much excludes you from any sympathy. You guys are having to serve extra tours and extended tours because there are not enough replacements. Nobody wants to fight this war. You wanted to fight it, now fight it and quit your whining. And frankly the idea that some snot nosed enlisted puke has become the old guard is laughable. The average career of a military officer in the US military is 38 years. You have a LONG wasy to go before you are even going to be viewed as anything but a worthless new guy.\n \n You do not even seem to be able to understand the concept of honor among soldiers. You are a united states soldier. Your job is to protect the lives and well being of innocents at any price. This is why the military is having trouble retaining officers today. The guys who have been around, who actually served with pride as part of an honorable military, want no part in your pathetic orgy of slaughter. One of the guys in my unit once turned himself over for court martial because he used a fragmentation grenade in a civilian area while we were taking heavy fire. No civilians were injured, but our standing orders were to preserve and protect the civilian population at all costs, and he endangered those people through his actions. That is the way things WERE done prior to this latest round of idiocy. 10 years ago I could have had you discharged due soley to your attitude on this.\n \n The problem is that we have had trouble getting recruits. No reasonable person is going to sign up to throw thier life away on a crusade that by all accounts is strngthening our enemies and endangering the united states. So, the Bush administration has loosened enlistment criteria. For decades white supremacists, lunatics, and XXXXXX were not accepted. Now that has changed and they are taking all manner of trash. At one time your arttitude would have led to a psych evaluation and probably discharge because the fact that you cannto properly identify the mission OR the enemy makes you a liability. Today, they will keep you around until you rape some Iraqi girl and kill off her entire family. Then, IF the media catchs you, they will do something about it. \n \n Luckily, the Bush administration is on the way out, and whoever replaces him is not going to continue to protect you. The only republican that really has a shot at the white house is McCain, and he is from the old guard. He is not going to tolerate the kind of #### that has been going on in our military.",

To argue that is simply arguing the unknown. \n\n \n The war was originally supported wholeheartedly by most in America and virtually all in American politics. The democrats and most true conservatives did not jump ship until the war started going badly and the revelatiosn started coming that the Bush administration had lied ot get us there. \n \n From a practical standpoint there was no way we were going to win the war. It was an impossibility from day one regardless of support, troop strength, or tactics. This is fourth generation warfare. Stop trying to re-fight WWII. At one time it might have been argued that this was not Bush fault, but rather he had been given bad advice. Now that the military commanders from the pre invasion days have juped ship and made public statements, we know that is not the case. They told him that they needed 400,000 troops in order to suceed in the mission and that civilain casualties would have to be minimized, and that we could expect 25% casualties on our side. Instead he sent a fractio of the required troop strength and adopted a strategy that minimized american casualties at the expens of the civilian population. Now we can't seem to figure out why the Iraqis are not our buddies. Go figure.\n \n \n3. Actually, I do hope for a better life for Iraqis. Not defined as \"perfect\" as I don't consider that possible. But, at least with the ability to choose who leads their nation even if that choice views the U.S. with contempt. But, not being overly naive, I do confess that considering the effects of \"Islam\" on any government, that democracy is likely low on the gift list of the average Iraqi.\n 4. Wow, I didn't realize what a jerk I am. I admit one thing, I don't want to wave the white flag. Nor do I look forward to the massacre that will take place upon our departure. \n\n \n So you wish the IRaqis well, and are supporting the religous fundamentalists that are running death squads in their country. There is a reality deficit here.\n \n \n5. I have seen your claim to conservatism prior to this thread. I do not question it. I am much farther to the right than the options available to me to support will allow me to go. I simply choose not to hate the president for making mistakes. I could, but I would simply be one more person feeding the hate without seeking solutions. I have never heard of possible options provided by anyone. Had the left or the far right offered some option other than the path the president took, and voted their conscience the beginning may have not brought the action to the condition it is in. But, most were on board with the action and turned against it when it became politically expedient, to the mis-fortune of the average Iraqi citizen. \n\n \n At this point there are no good options. We can either continue to support the tyrants we have put in power, or we can stop. Either way a lot of Iraqis are going to die. The first way, continued support, results in the survivors living undre a totalitarian fundamentalist regime. The second way at least they have a chance at something better.\n \n \nI don't give presidents much credit for the economics of a nation. People are working as much or more than they ever have. Life for the average American, not perfect, but far better than many citizens of the world. No one has attacked the U.S. since 9-11. Life is good. No president should get the credit for that or the blame for the opposite. \n\n \n I seldom give credit to current presidents for current economic conditions either. From a practical standpoint it takes so long for the results of a presidents actions to filter into the economy as a whole that they are typically out of office long before we see those effects. the excpetion to this is deficit spending, because that is one area over which there is direct control and over which there is no real debate over the long term effects.",

   " Fightingand dying and reflecting VERY poorly on the US. This is why soldiers in the US military were always held to the highest standards of behavior while deployed...until they got hard up for people, then we let it slip a little...then a lot.\n\n \n This is the reality of fighting a war on a political and military front. People screw up and the press is there to hold us accountable. Its a good thing. The mission is not yet the mission that I want. But it is still the mission that our Commanding Officers want. Regardless of my feelings on the subject, I always obey orders no matter how dirty, inconvient, or self defeating I think they are. And need I remind you that all Marines and Soldiers have screwed up no matter the state of war that we were in at the time. Only now, often if you \"screw up\" it's in a combat zone and it has strategic political consequences. As much as I respect you Seniors and Elders, you have to admit that you never had nearly as much rope as we do to hang ourselves. Standards have not losened brother, let me assure you, the stakes have merely increased and you only hear of the really bad screw ups.\n \n \nRead the last NIR.

You want to pullout and have us sent home. WE want to STAY, REFINE, and EXECUTE the MISSION not just in Iraq but in Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and those portions of Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philipines that are afflicted by this virus that is Islam.\n \n \nFinally (because I sense you are growing weary of this topic)...No BS...one soldier to another...get down and get a psych workup done.

Find somebody to help you untie those knots.\n\n \n I appreciate your advice however I can tell you with complete confidence that I am not suffering from any form of PTSD in any way. Combat Stress is not the big scary thing that the head shrinks and the defeatist media would love for you to believe that it is. I can tell you that it afflicts only a very tiny percentage of Marines that I have served with, and it always manifests itself in those particular individuals while they are in conus. For the vast majority of those who are afflicted and who do exhibit symptoms while in country, they get over it and it never bothers them again. I have heard of a Marine not being able to complete his tour due to the minor impediment of PTSD. Never. I have heard of only one case of a service member who freaked out, dishonored himself, and ###### his pants to such a degree that his command made him disappear. That was in the case of a particular Corpsman who served with 2/5 while they were in Ramadi in '05. We don't have medics like the Army. Our Battlefield medics are known as Corpsman, and on the whole, they are as fine as, and, in many cases, become superior to the Marines that they fight along side with and save on a daily basis in Iraq. If you really care to know the particulars, I can get in touch with my buddy Cpl Murietta who is probably back in Ramadi right now with 2/5 again and you can learn about what PTSD really is. But, back to my secondary point, cases of PTSD are EXTREMELY RARE. And primarily, I am certainly not one of those suffering from this minor ailment, as any one of my buddies can attest to. Again, this is not a brush off from me of your considerations, I'm just letting you know for the sake of my pride and for those who do actually suffer from this condition, that I thankfully do not suffer from PTSD.",

They helped build planes, they made assembly lines to clothe them, they flew planes to deliver food and supplies to them while under attack?\n\n \n Umm, I have no beef here. They helped BUILD things in FACTORIES not in the MILITARY. Check your records. They were employed by the government, and most didn't have the option to sign a contract for military service. Now on to this buisness of flying them food and supplies. I have never heard of such a thing happening. \n NOW, I do know there were female pilots and some of them may very well have flown resupply missions, POSSIBLY into combat zones as a last resort and when all other means had failed. These were the exceptions and not the rules. They, in no way, proved anything beyond the fact that they could fly a plane, pick up an MRE box (or whatever they had back in WWII) and put it on the ground. Every Marine should be ready to fight and die. Therefore every Marine should be male. Females add nothing but problems and performance issues to the equation. Drop your holier than thou attitude. There are reasons for a lot of the traditions we have. Not all of those reasons are cogent, but in this case our elders and ancients turned out to be correct. \n \n \nBefore you start saying you compromised to have them in the military open up your history book.\n\n \n My pleasure. I love reading about this topic. Start me off and give me the source you're working with wouldn't you?\n \n \nLoose boot camp you say? One of my very closest friends joined the marines not too long ago. During this \"loose\" boot camp he brove his ankle in 4 spots and tore 3 ligaments. Not to mention 2 of the other men training broke their arm and leg.\n\n \n Did you friend mention that most of our time in boot camp is wasted marching around in antiquated battle formations THAT HAVE PASSED FROM USE FOR NEARLY A CENTURY AND A HALF? Not to mention, the marines are traditionally used for HIGHLY UNCONVENTIONAL OFFENSIVE AIRBORNE, TRACK AND AMPHIBIOUS ASSAULTs. Ever tried to do a column left in 30 meters of water with a 90 lb ruck and keep your rifle, your mortar equipment, and your section all together? Yeah, didn't think so. Not that this stuff doesn't have SOME value but gee whiz, there's a better way to do things.\n \n Listen I'm not saying we sit around sining Kumbayyah, I'm saying we get rid of the antiquated uniforms, the antiquated tactics and drill, and replace them with things of VALUE in todays battlefield. This kind of attitude pervades even into the fleet especially with the lifers who come off the drill field. They are totally ignorant of what its like in afganistan and Iraq. Which reminds me: Even seen a column half right climbing up some god awful mountain in Afganistan? No? Didn't think so. Ever seen Humvees doing an about face on Route Fran in the middle of Fallujah? Yeah, again, didn't think so. WE develop the tactics. THEY keep teaching us like we're marching off to gettysburg and you guys eat it up. Quit encouraging them! I'm not saying we have to \"tear it all down.\" Far from it. But you can still enstill discipline and make marines without handicapping boots by teaching them all the wrong modes of discipline by teaching them outmoded forms of organization and downright backwards uniforms that we DONT EVEN WEAR INTO BATTLE! You think we wear that Alpha uniform into combat deployments? Think again chump. That stuff stays back in TMO. Its useless and expensive to us and the Taxpayers.\n I DONT have all the answers, Im just saying we should start looking at better ways to get boots ready for MCT and SOI. (And those are a whole other issue. Although they are adapting pretty quickly from what I've seen. More quickly than our Boot Camp, thats for sure.)\n \n \n \nNow how is something you call loose going to cause all this damage? i would reconsider what you said above because it is very ignorant, and personally it ticks me off. (being a woman joining the military.)\n\n \n You just answered your own question there buddy. Do you realize that YOU as the taxpayer have to pay for you buddies if they get kicked out of the Marine Corps for those Medical Problems? And most of those medical problems come about NOT from constantly running and PT, but from marching around in antiquated formations learning lessons that are hundreds of years dusty. Boot camp should start, run, and end at Camp Pendleton NOT San Diego MCRD. *Sigh* Ok this is not going anywhere. Ok here, Ill list the things I would change about Boot Camp. Not saying I wouldn't want to change more but here goes:\n \n 1. Scrap all the worthless, costly, superflous uniforms except for our green and tan diggie BDUs.\n \n 2. Get rid of the EMPHASIS on the CURRENT form of marching and formations (you know, lining us up like ducks?). Practice fire team rushing, taking cover, rushing, bounding, over watch, getting across danger areas, etc etc. SOI (ITB/MCT) can sharpen those skills, but boot camp should get you atleast aquainted with practicing these things. For christsake, this isn't the 17th century. I know we all loved 300 but come on.\n \n 3. If you're going to develop a Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, ACTUALLY TEACH IT LIKE WE'RE GOING TO USE IT. Did you know, that after about T-20 or 30 we take some cheesy MCMAP test and then its pretty much curtains for MCMAP? And MCMAP is a joke. Why spend all this tax payer money on developing this stupid hack martial arts form when a perfectly good system already exsists - namely judo. I'm not exagerating here. After about Training day 30, you're training in MCMAP training pretty much stops. You don't even really get a chance to pursue it until you pick up Sergeant or Staff on your second hitch and then ONLY if your command sends you to the school and then ONLY if everyone elses commands havent sent them to the same school and filled up all the available boatspaces. Martial Arts training, Rifle Range Traning, and HIKING should be constant from day ONE and shouldn't stop until you get deployed. \n \n 4.

   "You're obviously being facetious, however I'm wondering what your point is beyond confirming our suspicions that you've run out of anything meaningful to say.\n\n My statement was a response to TANSTAAFL'07's remark that \"The Cannon fodder\" is NOT willing to come home. Most of the \"Cannon fodder\" wants to change the mission to include all of Islam as deserving of enemy #1 status. .\n This is of course a BS argument because he cannot in any way speak for most of the troops just like I can't speak for all of them. And judging by his response to my remarks the point is obviously lost on him.\n \n \n \nThe Marines are not phony. They have however, been diluted by constant compromises (women in the military, lax standards, loose boot camp). My seniors tell me that even 5 years ago, things were a lot tougher going through boot camp and SOI. Physical standards were tougher in the fleet yet they were a lot tighter. Fire team leaders were gods. Officers were distant and focused on doing what they were best at - Paper work.\n\n I'm not saying that the Marines are phony, just that TANSTAAFL'07 is a fake Marine. Every other post he keeps reminding us that he's a Marine but judging by his behavior, he can't possibly be one.\n Hew can't even identify the mission, nor can he identify who the enemy is. I know that standards have dropped, but I seriously doubt that the Marines would let him in. If he would have said that he was Army I might have believed him.\n He's just one of those armchair generals that likes to pretend he's a real man by saying he's a Marine.

   "just that TANSTAAFL'07 is a fake Marine.\n\n \n LCPLIC is TANSTAAFL'07 and both are ME. I thought you would get that. I got banned as Tanstaafl for saying \"meanie\" words. Now on to this nonsense of being a fake marine. Listen you say I'm not a marine. I'm telling you unequivocaly that I am. If you would actually read what I've posted and ask another marine who's in the fleet he could tell you that I was in. There is no way a non-marine would know about all that stuff and be able to write about it as I have done.\n \n \nThis is of course a BS argument because he cannot in any way speak for most of the troops just like I can't speak for all of them. And judging by his response to my remarks the point is obviously lost on him.\n \n\n \n *sigh* Dear, GOD I never CLAIMED to speak for EVERY SINGLE soilder and marine over there. OF COURSE the National Guard and the Reservists are whining about having to be over there - its in their self interest to do so. They signed on to do 1 weekend a month and 2 weeks a year to get some extra money and assistance for going to school. They are the DREGS of our armed service. They are always involved in near miss friendly fire incident (we got shot at doing a cas evac going into JC/Camp Ramadi by these XXXXXX. I think it was either the Pennsylvania national gaurd or the Kentucky National Gaurd. Pretty sure it was the Penn national gaurd. They're akin to conscripts in terms of the quality of their service. They volunteered of course, but they didn't volunteer to fight but as a GAMBLE hoping (foolishly of course) thinking nothing would happen and they would get to skate by. Well, their feet are to the fire now and they are predictably screaming bloody murder. HOWEVER, within the ACTIVE DUTY ranks, I CAN speak for virtually my entire REGIMENT when I say that we want to expand the mission and continue the fight. You gotta understand, the 5th Marine Regiment is located in Camp San Mateo on Camp Pendleton. Its pretty small. Everyone sees and knows just about everyone else on a daily basis. Now, a lot of guys across battalions don't know other guys in different battalions personally, but we're aware of each other and hear each other talking. I have NEVER heard the kind of defeatist junk coming out of many of your mouths and the mouths of some of those sissy reservists and national gaurd weekend warrior types, coming out of the mouths of ANY active duty infantry marine. Our job is the toughest, and the most dangerous, so you'd expect us to be the loudest about getting out of Iraq. NOT SO. \n \n This has got me thinking. Do you live in Southern California by chance? Any body on this forum who WANTS EMPIRICAL PROOF THAT WHAT I HAVE JUST SAID IS TRUE, LEMME KNOW! I can give you a tour of San Mateo and you can ask the Marines YOURSELF without higher ups knowing about it so you can't claim the test was somehow tainted. I'm serious as a heart attack. You want a chance to test your silly little civilian beliefs? Fine, you got it. Post on this board and let me know and I'll get it set up. Seriously, I'm not kidding around.\n \n P.S. - Where does a civilian get off telling a Marine what Marines believe and don't believe? Thats absurd. I'm sorry I don't fit your little narrow minded profile of what a marine should be, but this is reality. The vast majority of the infantry VOLUNTEER to fight the war, partly in the hopes that the mission will be expanded and we will go over to Iran. You're the arm chair general, thinking that we would have anything to benefit strategically by pulling out and not pursuing this. This has to end NOW.",

   "Yes, lets.\n \n \n \n \n Umm, I have no beef here. They helped BUILD things in FACTORIES not in the MILITARY. Check your records. They were employed by the government, and most didn't have the option to sign a contract for military service. Now on to this buisness of flying them food and supplies. I have never heard of such a thing happening. \n NOW, I do know there were female pilots and some of them may very well have flown resupply missions, POSSIBLY into combat zones as a last resort and when all other means had failed. These were the exceptions and not the rules. They, in no way, proved anything beyond the fact that they could fly a plane, pick up an MRE box (or whatever they had back in WWII) and put it on the ground. Every Marine should be ready to fight and die. Therefore every Marine should be male. Females add nothing but problems and performance issues to the equation. Drop your holier than thou attitude. There are reasons for a lot of the traditions we have. Not all of those reasons are cogent, but in this case our elders and ancients turned out to be correct. \n \n \n \n My pleasure. I love reading about this topic. Start me off and give me the source you're working with wouldn't you?\n \n \n \n Did you friend mention that most of our time in boot camp is wasted marching around in antiquated battle formations THAT HAVE PASSED FROM USE FOR NEARLY A CENTURY AND A HALF? Not to mention, the marines are traditionally used for HIGHLY UNCONVENTIONAL OFFENSIVE AIRBORNE, TRACK AND AMPHIBIOUS ASSAULTs. Ever tried to do a column left in 30 meters of water with a 90 lb ruck and keep your rifle, your mortar equipment, and your section all together? Yeah, didn't think so. Not that this stuff doesn't have SOME value but gee whiz, there's a better way to do things.\n \n Listen I'm not saying we sit around sining Kumbayyah, I'm saying we get rid of the antiquated uniforms, the antiquated tactics and drill, and replace them with things of VALUE in todays battlefield. This kind of attitude pervades even into the fleet especially with the lifers who come off the drill field. They are totally ignorant of what its like in afganistan and Iraq. Which reminds me: Even seen a column half right climbing up some god awful mountain in Afganistan? No? Didn't think so. Ever seen Humvees doing an about face on Route Fran in the middle of Fallujah? Yeah, again, didn't think so. WE develop the tactics. THEY keep teaching us like we're marching off to gettysburg and you guys eat it up. Quit encouraging them! I'm not saying we have to \"tear it all down.\" Far from it. But you can still enstill discipline and make marines without handicapping boots by teaching them all the wrong modes of discipline by teaching them outmoded forms of organization and downright backwards uniforms that we DONT EVEN WEAR INTO BATTLE! You think we wear that Alpha uniform into combat deployments? Think again chump. That stuff stays back in TMO. Its useless and expensive to us and the Taxpayers.\n I DONT have all the answers, Im just saying we should start looking at better ways to get boots ready for MCT and SOI. (And those are a whole other issue. Although they are adapting pretty quickly from what I've seen. More quickly than our Boot Camp, thats for sure.)\n \n \n \n \n You just answered your own question there buddy. Do you realize that YOU as the taxpayer have to pay for you buddies if they get kicked out of the Marine Corps for those Medical Problems? And most of those medical problems come about NOT from constantly running and PT, but from marching around in antiquated formations learning lessons that are hundreds of years dusty. Boot camp should start, run, and end at Camp Pendleton NOT San Diego MCRD. *Sigh* Ok this is not going anywhere. Ok here, Ill list the things I would change about Boot Camp. Not saying I wouldn't want to change more but here goes:\n \n 1. Scrap all the worthless, costly, superflous uniforms except for our green and tan diggie BDUs.\n \n 2. Get rid of the EMPHASIS on the CURRENT form of marching and formations (you know, lining us up like ducks?). Practice fire team rushing, taking cover, rushing, bounding, over watch, getting across danger areas, etc etc. SOI (ITB/MCT) can sharpen those skills, but boot camp should get you atleast aquainted with practicing these things. For christsake, this isn't the 17th century. I know we all loved 300 but come on.\n \n 3. If you're going to develop a Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, ACTUALLY TEACH IT LIKE WE'RE GOING TO USE IT. Did you know, that after about T-20 or 30 we take some cheesy MCMAP test and then its pretty much curtains for MCMAP? And MCMAP is a joke. Why spend all this tax payer money on developing this stupid hack martial arts form when a perfectly good system already exsists - namely judo. I'm not exagerating here. After about Training day 30, you're training in MCMAP training pretty much stops. You don't even really get a chance to pursue it until you pick up Sergeant or Staff on your second hitch and then ONLY if your command sends you to the school and then ONLY if everyone elses commands havent sent them to the same school and filled up all the available boatspaces. Martial Arts training, Rifle Range Traning, and HIKING should be constant from day ONE and shouldn't stop until you get deployed. \n \n 4. There should be a regimented weight lifting program and a complementing Diet. Most Marines in boot camp Lose upper body strength (measured in pullups) or stay about the same. Why? The object of training should not be to turn us into skinny little tooth picks but to build us into human pack mules capable of handling the brutal 20 mile hikes that await most Infantryman in the fleet (much much more \"fun\" awaits you if you're recon but thats a different story. They actually have an AWESOME training regime, but a lot of that has to do with letting team leaders handle the training instead of waiting for some lazy, micromanaging SNCO to tell us what we may do, like they do in the regular grunts.)\n \n Ok so thats a start. Ask your buddy if they still make them do the reaper. And wish him good luck, especially if hes in the infantry or is open contract. Tell him to pray they don't send him to 29 Palms - it BLOWS. \n \n Every marine is going to have a different opinion, obviously. A lot of guys might say they gained a pullup or 2. Some might say they joined on for the uniform. I gotta say as a guy who is, unfortunately, NOT ignorant, that after having done 3 combat tours, I can tell you what is useful and what is a waste of money. But hey what do I know right? I'm just a Marine and you, you're an all knowing civilian! You watched a CNN news special so you're solid, right? God save us..\n\n \n \n ok first of all after your little statement about women not adding anything but \"problems and performance issues\".. im gonna tell you straight up. You sound completely ist! WHat the hell is wrong with women wanting to stand for their beliefs, country and put those freaking ists back in their place.

After that line your comments and ignorant remarks werent even worth the time in reading.\n\n \n I'm with stupid to a point on this one. IF women pass the same physical tests as men, I see no problem with them serving in any condition as long as birth control is required (pregnancy=court martial offense). The problem when it comes to the physical tests is that they have devised a second set of less strenous tests for women. IMO this is unacceptable. There are good reasons for requiring upper body strength and endurance and if a woman cannot pass the same test as the guys, she does not belong there.\n \n On the birth conrol issue....when you train with a military unit you become part of a team. You learn to function together as a unit. If it is time for deployment and members of that unit are missing because they are pregnant, your unit is fractured and is less combat effective. You loose unit cohesion and risk the lives of everybody on that team (assuming we are talking combat missions here). IMO that is unacceptable.",

Many of whom were innocent civilians.\n \n They don't want us there.\n \n \nThats what the media tells you. Like I said, I have friends and family members who have been in Iraq, and every one of them tells some story of how many people rejoice and celebrate at the sight of an American soldier, threatening their own lives to protect the citizenry.\nWhy would the media tell us that outright lie?

Terrorists/insurgents from Iran and other areas would flock into the area, causing more pointless death than their is currently.\n We're the ones who originally brought the enemy to Iraq. Keep in mind we are fighting a philosophy, not real estate. The biggest reason for NOT invading. Its like saying that if we eradicate the terrorists in Iraq we are finally safe. We all know this is simply not true. Their philosophy will live on and attack us in other places. \nAlso, we, the US citizens, will be seen as cowards that don't even have the mettle to continue through the conflicts end.\n What will determine the end of the conflict? \nThis will lower our influence in global affairs, that could result in further disaster to not only our economy, but aggressor nations will not take us seriously either. And do you know what happens when an aggressor thinks that a power won't retaliate to it? It happened in the 1930s, Hitler didn't take the Western powers seriously, and much blood was shed. \n There isn't a country on this planet that wants to do battle with us whether or not we leave Iraq. \nIt happened on 9/11. The terrorrists did not take us seriously, and do you want to prove them right? \n The terrorists didn't attack us because they thought we were weak. They attacked us because we are the infidel and support the Jewish Nation. \nI don't know if we should have invaded originally or not, I'll admit that.\n I think the administration is with you on this one. \nBut don't tell me that their situation has gotten worse. And don't tell me that we should pull out. If that happens, all those deaths you complain about will be for nothing. \n Yes, we should pull out ASAP. \nThe brave troops that fell deserve better than for the country for which they died half-:xcensored the job and take the easy way out. I don't care if you support the war or not, thats your opinion. But, please, I ask you, support the troops, especially the ones that gave their lives to liberate Iraq. Don't dishonor them by advocating leaving and making their sacrifice a moot point\n I think you can tell by my avatar that I understand troop support. How many more troops have to die, be maimed for life before enough is enough? I support the troops. However, I support them enough to get them out of that unwinable situation and get them back home with their families. We sitting on almost 4,000 deaths of our GI's and 25,000 maimed. 4+ years in and we're no closer than we were in the beginning. \n \n Define \"winning\" there, please.

   "Ok explain to me how walking away from this will defeat terrorism..\n \n You can not defeat terrorism, the first recorded suicide killing can be found in the story of Samson. Most of the terror attacks on U.S. soil has come from Christian sects either bombing abortion clinics or Federal buildings. The only way to defeat terror is by having a society that remains diligent, and watches for such domestic threats. Someone has to report an over heard conspiracy from their respective Church; synagogue; or Mosque. Basically anywhere cults or groups would gather.\n \n the fact of the matter is, we can run, but we wont be able to hide... We must get the job done there or we will have to endure war on our own soil... (remember how this all started in the first place..\n \n So that brings it down to this... Would you rather our soldiers be dying over there or our civilians on our own soil?? We should be thankful for our armed services and their willingness to lay down their lives in love instead of the opposite side who lay down their lives in hate.. \n \n The attacks on U.S. soil came from a group known as Al Qeada. This group was operating in Afghanistan and was birthed in Saudi Arabia. The group only allows Sunni members and believes the Shia sect to be traitors to the truth faith. The Shia faith was started by a Jew, and they are awaiting a Messiah like the Christian and Jewish faiths are. Al Qeada has found some refuge in Iraq amongst the indigonious Sunni groups. The Shia want to engage Al Qeada but are held at bay because of their inability to mobilize and address the Al Qeada threat. Al Qeada can only operate in Iraq while U.S. forces are there preventing the mobilization of the far larger and better trained Shia Militias. Basically; our operations in Iraq actually contributes to the presence of Al Qeada.\n \n The Shia Militias have made it clear (Hezbollah, Hamus, etc.) that they do see the United States as a threat and have no interest in conducting operations against us. Though they do not want U.S. forces in the Middle East and have reacted negatively to any presence in their areas of operation. We can accommodate this because we have made it clear, we not an Imperial power.\n \n It is note worthy to state that the Al Qeada attack on 9-11-01 was by Osama Ben Laden's statements; because U.S. forces where in Saudi Arabia. We have withdrawn those forces at the Saudi Royal Families request just after 9-11. You can guess what the chanting was about in the streets of Saudi Arabia when we left and who they thanked.\n \n  In their heads, this isnt an idealogical war, its a theological war... and they wont stop even if we pull out.. they will seek us out. \n \n Al Qeada has made new objectives and they include the progression of their branch of the Muslim faith. The same objective most faiths have but their tactic includes terror. Currently the #1 best sold tee shirt in South America is the Osama Tee Shirt with towers behind him. It is also interesting to note that the single greatest charity provider is the Sunni Religion. No other religion touches their giving and this is proving to be effective in their out reach efforts.\n \n Al Qeada is our threat; they have stated their intentions to attack U.S. interests all over the world. We are busy trying to stabilize a place that by all known sects in the region has little love for us (the kurdish sect is touch and go). The reasons (mostly do to the cold war) are fascinating and should be openly discussed so like minds from both sides can express their grievances and come to a mutual understanding. To date, such talks have not occurred.",

Are you for or against abortion?? (just curious)\n\n \n Around 650000 more people have died than would have if the invasion hadn't taken place. Of those, around 200,000 were killed by coalition forces. Unless you are claiming they were all killed by British troops I'm not seeing what the confusion is. Even if we rely on passive sampling methods (e.g. media reports) there have still been 25 times as many people killed in Iraq as were killed during the September 11th attacks. The real issue here is that you think US lives are worth more than those of Iraqis.\n \n As for abortion, personally I'm against it and don't think anyone should have an abortion, but I don't think that, given there is no consensus on the issue, I have the right to impose my morality on others, particularly when I am never going to have to deal with being pregnant, and particularly given the consequences in terms of the harm caused to desperate women when abortion is prohibited.",

   "Looks like we've had a military force since colonial days.\n \n 1700s\n \n The Continental Army was created on 14 June 1775 by the Continental Congress as a unified army for the states to fight Great Britain, with George Washington appointed as its commander. George Washington, although not a great tactician, made use of the Fabian strategy and used hit-and-run tactics, hitting where the enemy was weakest, to wear the British, and their allies, the Hessian mercenaries, down. With a decisive victory at Yorktown, and the help of French and Dutch, the Continental Army prevailed against the British, and with the Treaty of Paris, the independence of the United States was acknowledged.\n \n After the war, though, the Continental Army was quickly disbanded as part of the Americans' distrust of standing armies, and amateur state militias became the new nation's sole ground army, with the exception of one battery of artillery guarding West Point's arsenal. However, because of continuing conflict with American Indians, it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army. The first of these, the Legion of the United States, was established in 1791.\n \n [edit] 1800s\n \n The First Barbary War (1801-1805) was the first of two Barbary Wars fought between the United States and the North African states known collectively as the Barbary States. The First Barbary War proved that America could execute a war far from home, and that American forces had the cohesion to fight together as Americans rather than Georgians or New Yorkers. The United States Navy and Marines became a permanent part of the American army and the American mythos, and Lieutenant Decatur returned to the U.S. as its first post-Revolutionary war hero.\n \n The War of 1812 (1812-1815), the second and last American war against the British, was mostly a series of defeats for the US Army. An invasion of Canada completely failed, and US troops were unable to stop the British from burning the new capital of Washington, D.C.. However, the Regular Army, under Generals Winfield Scott and Jacob Brown, proved they were professional and capable of defeating a British army in the Niagara Campaign of 1814. Two weeks after a treaty was signed, though, Andrew Jackson defeated the British invasion of New Orleans. However this had little effect, as per the treaty both sides returned to the status quo.\n \n Between 1815 and 1860, a spirit of Manifest Destiny struck the United States, and as settlers moved west the US Army engaged in a long series of skirmishes and battles with American Indians the colonists uprooted. The US Army also fought the short Mexican-American War, which was a victory for the United States and resulted in the new territories of California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming and New Mexico.\n \n The Civil War (1861-1865) was the most costly war for the United States. After most states in the South seceded to form the Confederate States of America, CSA troops opened fire on the US fort Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, starting the war. For the first two years Confederate forces solidly defeated the US Army, but after the decisive Battle of Gettysburg combined with superior industrial might and numbers, Union troops fought a brutal campaign through Confederate territory and the war ended with a Confederate surrender at Appomatox Courthouse in April 1865. Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% in the North and an extraordinary 18% in the South.[5]\n \n Following the Civil War, the US Army fought a long battle with American Indians, who resisted US expansion into the center of the continent. But by the 1890s the US saw itself as a potential player internationally. US victories in the Spanish-American War (1898) and the more unknown and controversial Philippine-American War (1898-1913), as well as US intervention in Latin America and the Boxer Rebellion, gained America more land and international prestige.\n \n [edit] 1900s\n \n The US joined World War I (1914-1918) in 1917 on the side of Britain and France. Millions of US troops were sent to the front and were instrumental in the push that finally broke through the German lines. With victory on November 11, 1918, the Army once again decreased its forces.\n \n World War II started in 1939 but the United States did not join until 1941 following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. On the European front, US Army troops made up large portions of the forces that captured North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, and on D-Day, the resulting liberation of Europe and defeat of Germany, the millions of US Army troops played a central role. In the Pacific, millions of Army soldiers participated in the \"island hopping\" campaign that wrested the Pacific islands from Japanese control. Following Axis Powers surrender in August/September 1945, US troops were deployed to Japan and Germany to occupy the two nations.\n \n However, this set the stage for the west-east confrontation known as the Cold War (late 1940s to late 1980s/early 1990s). Millions of US troops were deployed to West Germany and the rest of Europe in anticipation of Soviet attack, but the invasion never came. Instead, US troops and their allies fought non-Soviet communist forces in Korea and Vietnam, as part of the domino theory.",
