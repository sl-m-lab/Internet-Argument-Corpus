   "Drug gang sweep results in hundreds of arrests - CNN.com\n \n \nAuthorities across the United States have arrested 678 people with alleged ties to Mexican drug trafficking organizations in a three-month operation led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency announced Tuesday.\n \n Among those caught up in the sweep were 322 people with violent criminal histories, the agency said in a news release. They represent 133 gangs and 24 countries, it said.\n \n The operation targeted transnational gangs, which the agency said include large numbers of foreign nationals as members and often are involved in human smuggling, identity theft, fraud, weapons trafficking and the drug trade.\n \n \"Like any street gang, these transnational gangs also have a propensity toward violence,\" according to the news release. \"Their members committed a number of violent crimes including robbery, extortion, assault, rape and murder.\"\n \n The sweep, called Project Southern Tempest, also resulted in the arrests of 164 other people for alleged non-drug violations or immigration violations, the agency said.\n \n Authorities seized 86 guns, eight pounds of methamphetamine, 30 pounds of marijuana, a pound of cocaine, $70,000 in cash and two vehicles during the operation, which began in December and ended this month, the release said.\n \n The operation is the largest-ever led by the agency to target gangs with ties to drug trafficking, according to the release. It involved 173 local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.\n\n \n See? This is the type of operation that has to be carried out in order to actually fight crime. Not limiting the number of firearms a person can purchase each month, or mandating registration and storage methods, but rather targeting street gangs.\n \n As the article says those arrested have violent criminal histories and are involved in weapon smuggling, drug trafficking and murder, to say the least. These are the real people that the authorities need to be going after. These are the targets that law enforcement should be spending their resources on, not crucifying FFL dealers and private individuals and mandating more and more paperwork.",
