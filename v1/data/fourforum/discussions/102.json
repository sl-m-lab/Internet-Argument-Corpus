One less species.\n\n \n Jurassic Theropods like Compsognathus had hollow bones.\n http://www.cbv.ns.ca/marigold/history/dinosaurs/datafiles/compsognathuspic.jpg \n \n Therepodian dinosaurs show clear general skeletal affinities with modern birds such as long limbs, hollow bones, foot with 3 toes in front and 1 reversed toe behind and a long ilium.\n \n Coelophysis, from the late Triassic was one of the first theropod dinosaurs.\n \n Deinonychus and Oviraptor from the late Triassic to the Cretaceous were bipedal advanced theropods, larger, with more bird-like skeletal features: semilunate carpal, bony sternum, long arms and reversed pubis. Striking detailed similarity to birds.\n \n There is a gap in the fossil record here although Protoavis could belong here, unfourtunately, the fossil is poor.\n \n Archaeopteryx  from 225 Ma, shows a mosaic of reptilian and avian features, with the reptilian features predominating. The skull and skeleton are basically reptilian (skull, teeth, vertebrae, sternum, ribs, pelvis, tail, digits, claws, generally unfused bones). Bird traits are limited to an avian furcula (wishbone, for attachment of flight muscles; recall that at least some dinosaurs had this too), modified forelimbs, and -- the real kicker -- unmistakable lift-producing flight feathers. Archeopteryx could probably flap from tree to tree, but couldn't take off from the ground, since it lacked a keeled breastbone for large flight muscles, and had a weak shoulder compared to modern birds. (Wellnhofer, 1993)\n \n S. santensis from 138 Ma was a better flyer than Archaeopteryx. It had a short trunk, claws on the toes, flight-specialized shoulders, stronger flight- feather bones, tightly folding wrist and short hands.\n \n A not yet named bird/dino from 131 Ma has a reptilian pelvis and legs, with bird-like shoulders. The tail is medium-length with a fused tip.\n \n Then there's Hesperornis, Ichthyornis, and other Cretaceous diving birds. There are many fossils. Their skeleton is further modified for flight showing fusion of pelvis bones, fusion of hand bones and a short, fused tail). It also still had true socketed teeth, a reptilian trait.\n \n There are others and this is by no mean exhaustive. This is just to show that there are very good transition lineages.\n \n Although no modern birds have teeth, chicken bills can be induced to develop teeth, indicating that chickens still retain the genes for making teeth.\n \n There is also an intriguing fossil Microraptor gui that has flight feathers on both the front and back legs.\n http://eur.news1.yimg.com/eur.yimg.com/xp/reuters_ids/20030123/i/2567138235.jpg \n \n I can provide more info on any of these if you wish.\n \n References\n \n Wellnhofer, P. 1993.

The Theropod dinosaurs were the size of a large bird, were excelent runners and probably ate insects.

   "My point was that just because an animal has features that resemble different animals doesn't mean it has evolved from them.\n\n \n But who has claimed that it is so? Certainly not evolutionary biologists. So you are claiming that since birds fly and bumblebees fly that evolutionary biologists claim that birds evolved from bumblefbees? And since the snout of a Platypus (you didn't even invest the integrity to learn how to spell that correctly, did you?) has a superficial resemblence to a duck, it must be that evolutionary biologists are asserting that the platypus evolved from a duck.\n \n I'm still waiting for an explanation of where you studied evolution, by the way. You assured us that it was a \"detailed\" study. And yet, you display your total ignorance by equating evolution to \"gotten better.\"\n \n \nOnce again, my point was that evolutionists contradict each other.\n\n \n Then by that standard, christianity is horse puckey! Christians contradict each other. Oh! But wait. Anyone who disagrees with you isn't \"really\" a christian.\n \n \nOne says A. was mostly bird, the other says mostly reptile. One says A. was a link, another says that A. could not have been a link.\n\n \n I see that you lack the integrity to even learn how to spell the words necessary to discuss the topic. Let me help. That is Archaeopteryx. Those who have actually invested the integrity to learn what they are talking about and those who have studied evolutionary theory in detail know that A. is only meaningful when previously referenced and then, only when the species is also mentioned - in this case A. lithographica or A. bavarica. But since you can't spell platypus, why would anyone expect that you had actually done a detailed study to the extent that you could spell Archaeopteryx?\n \n But, no matter. Your total ignorance of science is apparent from the very fact that you think that disagreement on some details casts a doubt on the grander theory. (Of course, you don't seem to see disagreements on major tenets of faith as evidence against your form of christianity, based primarily on mythology) A minority of evolutionary biologists disagrees with the theory that birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs. One of those is Allan Feduccia, a favorite son of creationists, in spite of the fact that gives no credence to creationism. Creationists even offer quotes from Feduccia as if they were somehow supportive of creationism. Those who do are, without question, totally ignorant of the principles of logic and science. Disproof of one hypothesis does not support any other. Thus, any arguments against evolutionary theory are not support for creationism. Creationism must either stand or fall on its own merits. Scientists (who were also creationists) struck down a literal reading of Genesis more than 200 years ago. And yet, American fundamentalist creationists have reject their contradictory findings, based on actual study, in favor of the mythology of nomadic herdsmen.\n \n \n\n Well, here's another quote from Allan Feduucia:\n \n \"Feathers are unique to birds, and no known structure intermediate between scales and feathers has been identified.\" (J. Alan Feduccia, The Age of Birds, Harvard University Press, 1980, pg. 52)\n\n \n Yippie doo! A 23 year old quote from an ornithologist defending his point of view. And his point of view has (or had) merit. But since then, several feathered dinosaurs (not birds) have been found. It has also been shown that the difference between a scale and a feather may be no more than a single point mutation. (You do know what I'm talking about, don't you Calli? You do know what a \"point mutation\" is, don't you?) Bottom line is that there may be no intermediate between scales and feathers. A single point mutation produces feathers from scales. Various kinds of feathers require only further mutation.\n \n \nSounds contradictory to me!\n\n \n So what is your point? Are you claiming that the tenets of christianity are in doubt because the several thousand denominations hold contradictory views? Science proceeds by challenges and contradictions. Contradiction in science is not evidence of doubt but evidence of a field of advance. In religion, it is without question, a matter of the veracity of the ultimate truth. Which of the thousands of christian faiths hold the truth?",

Scientists qualified in ornithology, paleontology, vertebrate anatomy and so on have said that the representation is accurate, but of course, you know better since you have studied none of that.\n \n http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather1.jpg \n \n So it now seems that you have conceded that the front limbs were useful, claws and all. The question is not about the feathers. Obviously, such an organism existed whether you can understand it or not. Unless you are claiming that your god created this fossil to fool us.\n \n But the feathers - they supply insulation. Makes one wonder at the education of creationists that they are unaware of this. They could have been useful in running, increasing the speed. Perhaps they increased the ability to leap. Maybe they were useful for gliding. Could be a lot of things.\n \n The point is, your assertion was that such structures could not have existed because you didn't understand. I have shown physical evidence of actual organisms. They did exist - that's a fact. So it doesn't matter what you can imagine. They did exist and they weren't useless.",

   "Todays squirrels and birds tend not to go into combat with claws capable of ripping a scaled hide, and teeth designed to tear flesh.\n\n \n I stated in another post that Compsognathus probably ate insects. We can only speculate on the behaviour of these creatures because nothing like them, except birds, are alive today. Your idea of the terrifying and aggressive scale ripping, flesh tearing dinosaurs probably comes from the over imaginitive minds of hollywood producers.\n \n If these creatures are anything like birds in their behaviour, they probably didn't fight each other often. Considering their size and structure they probably prefered to settle their differences with some sort of display (possibly another reason for their early feathers) and pick their physical battles very carefully.\n \n \nI went about this wrong. I am meaning that it would take millions of years for wings to evolve. During these millions of years, they will be undeveloped, simply masses attached to the dinosaur, and totally useless. When they reach their fully evolved form, they may have been of use, but until then, they could serve no purpose, and help the dino in no way at all, serving only as excess weight, and larger profile, hindering survival by not allowing particularly good hiding or movement. During the actual period of the wings evolution, they would be totally useless.\n\n \n And yet this is what they fossil record shows. There is alot of information floating around on the uses of feathers for insulation, hunting techniques, display etc before flight.\n \n Half a feather might not be as good for flight as a \"fully developed\" one, but dinosaurs had them and they probably were able to glide, albeit poorly, with them. Even less of a feather might shade a pool of water to allow them to spot small fish or for display to attract a potential mate. To say they were \"totally useless\", is simply false.

   "...except for the surprising lack of feathers present.\n \n \n I'm not sure what you are saying. Are you saying that you think that theropod dinosaurs should have more feathers than this Sinornithosaurus does? First you claim that the entire forelimb would have been useless, and when shown that it was not you claim that the feathers could not have existed because they would be useless, and now when shown a fossil that shows feathers, you are surprised that there are not more.\n \n I suspect that not all of the feathers on this creature are apparent in the fossil.\n \n http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather5.jpg \n \n http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather9a.jpg \n \n http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather11.jpg \n \n But there are enough to show that feathered dinosaurs did, in fact exist. Any argument about whether or not is is possible that such creatures existed is moot. It is irrelevant that you feel that such limbs would have been useless. Obviously they were not.\n \n So now we return to your original confused and erroneous arguments.\n \n \n1)Reptile develops feathers. They offer reduced protection. They itch. Rustle in the bush. Feathers devolve.\n\n \n They do not. They offer increased thermal protection and thus make a greater range of habitats possible. Feathers also offer increased protection from attack. They are so good that several native American cultures were known to make armor from feathers. They absorb and spread impact quite well.\n \n Feathers don't itch and they don't rustle in the bush.\n \n Do you have an answers that aren't examples of shallow thinking?\n \n \n2)Reptile develops wings. These thing are completely useless on a dino, they evolve right the hell away.\n\n \n Why would they be useless? They aren't useless on birds? And how is this qustion different in any meaningful way from the above? Aren't wings forelimbs with feathers? It seems that soaring or gliding or even faster running would be extremely useful.\n \n \n3)Reptile develops bird feet. These are far greater hinderances than assests, they go away.\n\n \n Why would they go away? Birds still have bird feet. How are they a hinderance? Have you looked at the feet of tridactyl dinosaurs? Are you aware that dinosaur tracks were at first thought to be the tracks of large birds? Wouldn't \"bird feet\" be beneficial to an animal that lived in trees?\n \n \n4)Reptile develops birdlike bones. Bones break, dinos can't do anything, go extinct. One less species.\n\n \n Absolute nonsense. Bird bones are very strong and offer the added advantage of being light. According to your logic birds should be extinct and unable to do anything.\n \n \n5)Everthing develops simultaniously. Abomination is the result half way through development, species either dies out or reverts to former self.\n\n \n But it has never been claimed that everything developet simultaneously. Probably not.\n \n So back to the original question that you ducked with ad hoc arguments. What is Archaeopteryx. If it is a bird, why does it have a tail, grastalia, teeth, pre-orbital fenestra, and on and on. If it isn't a bird then why does it have feathers, opposable hallux, pneumatic bones, a furcula, and even a small carina in one specimen? How can creationism explain Archaeopteryx?\n \n http://home.houston.rr.com/bybayouu/graphics/Archaeopteryx_lithographica_1.jpg",

It has been shown that repetition of the lesson increases learning. This is especially true when addressing reduced intellect. So far your whole argument has been \"I just can't believe...\" and your attitude has been \"I refuse to learn\" I am not \"holier than thou,\" but I am certainly more educated than thou about this topic.\n \n \nAnyhow, I have no problems with the Archaeopteryx. It was an interesting creature, but simply having features present from two different forms (bird and dinosaur) doesn't mean it is a link?\n\n \n Yes, you do have a problem with Archaeopteryx. You can't explain it from a creationist point of view. I'm not claiming that it is a \"link,\" whatever that may be. It is a transitional form. It is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors. It also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds. Some characteristics exist in both. The furcula, for example. A furcula has been identified in some theropods, but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved. An indication that it may be mostly connective tissue. Archaeopteryx has a furcula. But even at that it doesn't compare to the same structure in birds. It is intermediate. Imagine that!\n \n \nHmm...Bears have fur, claws, and the various organs necessery to survival. Beetles don't have fur or claws, but they do have all the organs necessery for survival. Cheetahs have all of the above, but their claws are more retractable, and more advance. Good grief, are bears a transitional species?\n\n \n No. Whoever claimed that they are?\n \n And what does \"organs necessary for survival\" mean? What are you talking about? You didn't even get the retractable claws part right since cheetahs can't retract their claws. I guess you realize that you have made yourself look like a fool with that little bit. That's why I keep going over what has been covered before. You don't understand and you flail with your little beetle nonsense. Actually, it is not just nonsense, it is stupid. I wonder why you don't have the integrity to learn the basics of what you claim to oppose. Really! This beetle/bear/cheetah thing is comic. Perhaps if we went over what a transitional is once again it might help.\n \n By the way, you didn't address the Sinornithosaurus pictures. While Archaeopteryx may be claimed to be a bird (with sustained flight doubtful due to the lack of carina), Sinornithosaurus is a dinosaur with feathers - and \"useless\" wings that end in clawed, grasping hands, not much different than the fully fledged Archaeopteryx. So you probably don't have a problem with it either. Or even Confuciusornis, Liaoningornis, or any of the other various examples of toothed or tailed birds/dinosaurs that have been discovered from China to Spain.\n \n Isn't it sad that I need to keep going over these matters that have already been covered in hopes that you might grasp what is being discussed?",

Do I need to go into detail about what organs necessery to survival are? I assume you know what an organ is? Good, that's a step in the right direction. So, a beetle has these, but not claws, or fur. The bear has all the organs, correct biology for survival, ect, but with the additions of fur and claws. Thats evolution, a step up. Now, the average housecat therefore must be a form connected by the bear to the beetle, due to the more advanced sight and claws it posesses. Hence evolution. Creature A is not advanced, but then we find creature C, which has much of what creature A has, but with improvents. We then discover creature B which has bits from both sides, and whadda know, it must be a transitional fossil. And yes, this is quite comic.

Much less does it offer any support for creationism. In fact, I have yet to see any support for creationism.\n \n Feduccia has published a more recent study that supports his view of the origins of the bird digits as compared to dinosaur digits. Feduccia asserts that birds evolved directly from some archosaur rather than through dinosaurs. One wonders at the wisdom of creationists in selecting an evolutionary biologist as an argument against evolution. The discussion is not whether evolution occurred, but only the specific course of that evolution. There is not a lot of support for Feduccia's viewpoint but it is certainly an issue that needs further study. Perhaps it will be resolved, perhaps not. There is actually very little embryologic evidence as to the origin of therapod digits but what there is seems to indicate I-II-III.\n \n Ruben et al. relied on a single, low resolution, poorly focused photograph of a single specimen of Sinosauropteryx for their conclusions. You can verify this fact by referring to the actual paper cited. Others who have examined high resolution photos of several specimens using various lighting techniques, or even the actual specimens, disagree with the conclusions drawn by Ruben et al. The separation that they claim exists between the abdominal cavity and the thoracic cavity does not exist. What Ruben et al. see as a separation is actually an irregular break in the sediment. Close examination of the site reveals obvious breaks in the ribs at that location that are continued in the counter slab. Apparently the irregular break occurred during separation of the slab/counterslab.\n \n As for the un-referenced comment about the shape of the bird pelvis. By the time dinosaurs were being described, bird anatomy was well known. There is a superficial similarity between the shape of the ornithischian pelvis and that of birds. In both the pubis runs back in parallel with the ischium. However, birds (and saurischians) lack the prepubic process of the ornithischians. Early birds, such as Archaeopteryx even retained the club-like termination that is typical of saurischians. \"Bird hipped\" (ornithischian) and \"Lizard hipped\" (saurischian) are descriptive names applied to general configuration only. It implies no ancestral implications. To make such a claim is either ignorant or dishonest.\n \n There is no question about whether Pie actually read the referenced journals. He didn't.
