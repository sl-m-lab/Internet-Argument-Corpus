   "My 6 y/o nephew (with help from his parents) bought me a study bible for my birthday. It is a beatiful leather-bound book with maps and everything. I looked it up online, and it sells for ~$50. A bigger waste of money I cannot imagine. First off, we already have a bible in the house. Second, I have already read the bible. Third, I don't believe in any of the fantastical elements to the bible, and consider it nothing more than a book of philosophy. \n \n My biggest issue wasn't really with the money...it was with the fact that my inlaws informed me that my nephew told them that is what I should get for my birthday...because I am not saved and he thought maybe it would help me to to understand jesus and accept him as my savior. In other words, it was his idea. \n \n I watched as this kid has been brainwashed by my inlaws since he was born. Although he has learned the catch phrases and can parrot them back ad nauseum, it is obvious that he really does not understand the fundamentals of christianity...and nor should he...keep in mind he is only 6. But it is blatently obvious that he never had a choice to believe any of this...it became ingrained into him just like the english language. It's called indoctrination...and it is easiest when done to children. It's just plain sad to watch. \n \n Last summer, my nephew found a snake in their yard while we were visiting. Both his parents and his grandparents (my wifes parents) were there at the time. I laughed when my nephew asked why it didn't have any legs. I wasn't laughing at his question, I was already laughing at the rediculous answer that I knew my mother in law was about to spew forth. As predicted, she spoke quickly about the garden of eden and the serpent and god's punishment for tricking eve, etc etc. My son also listened intently, and when she was finished...he just as quickly retorted with \"nuh uh...it's because of evolution...they are \"vestigal\" organs.\". While he stumbled on the word \"vestigial\" slightly...I was still so proud of him. My mother in law shifted uncomfortably in her seat and gave me the evil eye...while I ever so slightly smiled back at her. Needless to say, the subject got changed rather quick. \n \n My son later asked me in earnest why mimi would make up such a silly story. I quipped that maybe mimi was becoming mentally ill...and he seemed satisfied with that answer.",

Teaching Children to ask questions and think for themselves is not Indoctrination. Teaching Children to believe in something for which there is no real evidence Is, However I don't call it indoctrination because it's more like Brain washing. If a Child was not told by some Adult, Parent, or religious figure that \"GOD\" made the world and wants to save us all then that Child would not know to Go looking for Religion. \n \n An Atheist simply has no belief, Atheism is not a \"Movement\". IMO there should be one though because Mankind has had religion through most of our journey as a species and it's high time to change that. Religion has held us back as a species , not to mention the Atrocities that Men have committed in the name of Religion. \n \n I find it hilarious as well as sad that you people can systematically discard the hundreds of Gods that man has worshiped through the ages yet you question Us when we Discard your God.

My goodness Jyoshu I thought you smarter than this at least! Did you even read what the President read to kids? or his message?

And it just doesn't add up at all. \n \n \n\n I definitely do disagree with you about having 9 year-olds protesting abortions. Abortion is a clear cut issue--children tend to know it's wrong right up front to kill a baby in the womb--they have to be TAUGHT the pro-choice view that it's ok to do such a thing. \n\n \n Having an objectionable view on Abortion is one thing. Bringing your child to an abortion clinic at age 9 where they have no clue what a fetus is or how sex even works is just sick!!\n \n I mean seriously? Do you expect a child to grasp the concept of Abortion when they still believe in Santa Claus? You'd be mad to even think they would...\n \n And this goes for those on BOTH sides of the issue Jyoshu not just pro lifers.\n \n \n \n I don't see why they should not be allowed to take part in protests like that; it's part of the American system and participation in democracy.\n\n \n You cannot vote till age 18. Children do not even begin to hit puberty till earliest 11 and even then have little understanding of the world around them... This is just lunacy your speaking.\n \n \n \n \n Are you saying you wouldn't let a 9 year old protest for gay rights?\n\n \n \n Yes!! yes I am! I wouldn't let a child attend a gay rights rally, or a pride festival or any of that! Their far too young to grasp sexual concepts like that and have a firm understanding....\n \n That too is a form of indoctrination. It may be positive from my point of view but objectively I'd be a liar if I said it wasn't a form of indoctrinating an ignorant mind at such a young age.\n \n \n \n \nIt's not bad in any form where it's not harming people. \n\n \n Oh please..... Let's not go down a slippery slope on this OK?\n \n \n To truly get an objective view you would be viewing videos by religious people too to get their perspectives, if you were really interested in forming your own opinion. \n\n \n I have my own opinion. You forget Jyoshu I sat in a pew for well over 18 years forming my opinion on the matter... That much is clear.\n \n \n I think you've made up your mind already and wanting to make yourself feel better about it with these videos. \n\n \n Feel better? No no Jyoshu I want to learn! I want to see the world objectively for the first time! To learn is to be free and to understand is euphoria... \n \n Seeing these videos provides insight into a very precarious area that covers a broad spectrum of many sub issues... It's sad you cannot see it for what I can.\n \n \n There's no shortage of proactive atheists out there on a crusade about atheism or against religion, that's for sure, so if that one viewpoint is all you're wanting to watch, then you're set. \n\n \n A crusade? Are Atheists bombing buildings? Flying planes into skyscrapers? Killing US Soldiers? Shipping packages that are bombs via UPS to Jewish places of worship? NO.\n \n \n So do not claim for one minute we Atheists are on a crusade of any kind. What we Atheists see is a danger to the world. Fundamentalist Religion is ruining and endangering this world on all fronts. \n \n If you cannot see this look no further than the next article stating how many lives were claimed by the next suicide bomber Jyoshu.\n \n Either you will accept the evidence. or you will refute it and attempt to shape it to fit your views as all religious people do.\n \n \n But it's like right wingers who only ever listen to their own pet radio talk shows and so forth.\n\n \n I listen to sermons Jyoshu. I listen to religious people call in to Atheist public talk radio and voice their opinions in a debate like manner.

Yeah, whatever you say Jazy. emoticon_rolleyes Getting a little 'drama queen' on us, eh? Oooh, the sky is falling!!\n\n \n No I'm afraid that is rather your department.

Or all the Obama worship going on in young children classrooms we see Youtube vids of all the time.\n I definitely do disagree with you about having 9 year-olds protesting abortions. Abortion is a clear cut issue--children tend to know it's wrong right up front to kill a baby in the womb--they have to be TAUGHT the pro-choice view that it's ok to do such a thing. I don't see why they should not be allowed to take part in protests like that; it's part of the American system and participation in democracy.

So I don't see why being TAUGHT (accurately) is such a bad thing. All children have to be taught right from wrong...\n \n But yeah, a 9 year old who probably doesn't even know where babies come from is too young to be protesting abortion. Abortion protesters are jerks anyway. Most women who choose to have an abortion have just made the toughest choice of their lives, and the protesters have no insight into what those women are going through.

Most religious people somehow think that their Values and Morals are better than non religious people.. that's Arrogance.\n \n \n\n And I suspect that's what you're going to find with most people. Guess you're going to just have to get used to religion being a reality around you!\n \n \n Believe me I realize the Horrible fact that religion is here. But more and more people are opening their eyes to the reality that God is Imaginary and one day, probably not in my lifetime, but one day religion will die and mankind will finally be free to advance as a species. \n \n \n\n :) If it gets you all turned on to think of religion as brainwashing or whatever, go for it. But it ain't my experience.\n\n \n I don't think it I know it. I don't get off on knowing that either, I think it is a sad thing for anyone to be caught up in a religion that teaches people not to think for themselves.\n \n \n\n I'm glad for the religion of folks like ML King Jr, Desmond Tutu, Mother Theresa, etc.\n\n \n Yeah, these might have been some good people, with maybe the exception of The Nun. But they were just as brainwashed as you or any other religious Nutt. Mother Teresa,, Yeah Deny sick people of medical care because she placed faith in God that he would heal them and because she thought that their suffering would bring them closer to Jesus..

Sometimes it's in the form of nationalism, as in the form of Hitler and Mussolini. But the common denominator in them all is extremism. Just singling out religion is a cop out.

However from what little detail I could get from the article it told me they also sang Jesus songs... Perhaps your right. Perhaps we should get Obama away from our school children. He's teaching them religion..... *gasp*\n \n Quite ironic no?\n \n \nGay Text Books: Senator Mark Leno of San Francisco is proposing Senate Bill 48, known as the Fair Education Act. It would require classroom text books to be re-written with historical details about the gay movement in America and California. - KTXL[/url]\n \n\n \n So you want to refute history then? What because gay people are gay their to be snuffed out of history? Whether you agree with the gay rights movement or not, from a strictly historical standpoint this is not only tolerable but right.\n \n Just because you don't agree with perhaps Martin Luther King Jr. lets say and the civil rights movement, does that then mean it should not be taught?\n \n Or another angle, what about Hitler? Or the Holocaust? Just because you don't agree with the actions of Nazism should we refrain from teaching the lessons of our past?\n \n You see Jyoshu the interesting thing about history is you cannot skew it. Unless your Texas changing the interpretation of the founding fathers which is just a crime in my opinion...\n \n But nevertheless. History does not lie. History shows us the progress and the utter failures of humanity our best triumph and our lowest falls... This is what you must embrace if we are to move forward as a species and as people in this world.\n \n \nHomosexuals brainwashing our children in elementary schools\n\n \n I won't even comment on the above link.

Our minds are very rapid learners and very keen especially at a young age.\n \n However just from sheer lack of experience and sexual development in our bodies at our age you and I can both say a child, like Abortion will not grasp nor fully be able to realize the full scope of the issue revolving around their sexuality at that particular age.\n \n \n \n \nWhat, one or two churches, max? Sorry but that only confirms the picture you're giving of your limited skewed view of religion.\n\n \n Jyoshu I could go to a thousand churches, read every single holy text front cover to back and they would still all have the very same holes in them as the other....\n \n \n \n \n \nAbsolutely a crusade. \n\n \n My goodness your utterly mad!

How can you make such leaps and bounds to this claim? Is your religion that ingrained into your head you'll now accuse people who want nothing more than rationality and a clear understanding of our world to be insane?\n \n If these men were off tilt I could really tell you no one in the scientific community would pay them any mind and they'd be just other fringe people. But their not.\n \n And accusing these men of being crazy because you personally cling to the equivalent the world is flat is just utter nonsense.\n \n \n \n \n They've crossed the line from lack of belief to pro-active ideology against something they hate and have bigotry toward.\n\n \n hate and have bigotry towards.... Is this not what religious people do now? is this not what you've been doing in this post? I find it quite laughable that someone with your seemingly depth and perception at the very basis, can be tricked and fooled by such utter nonsense Jyoshu.\n \n If you claim scientists are bigots its not from a theological standpoint but a rational one with mounds upon mounds of evidence... \n \n If you claim they hate religion I would say that is a tad extreme. But if you look at the counter result, the other alternative I could see why many of them are utterly bitter towards religion.",

   "Secular Morality as Inferior\n \n Excerpt:\n \n \nThere are those who think that a morality based on a negative motivation is inferior to one based on positive motives. To avoid doing wrong based on fear is far inferior to a morality based on well reasoned principles and the desire of the autonomous moral agents to act in a manner that is in accord with some set of basic ethical principles that resonates with some core values. Religious morality appears to rest on fear. There is the fear of reprisals from deity or deities. There is fear of punishments from a deity. There is fear of a next lifetime being set under conditions that are not favorable. There is the fear of the loss of salvation and eternal damnation and punishment. Opposed to such a motive secular ethics is based on the well reasoned conclusion that certain conditions for social life that a valued are better achieved by adherence to some set of guiding principles for decision making. \n \n There is much criticism of the moral foundation of Western Civilization located in the proselytizing religions of monotheistic tradition. The morality of the Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions have all at one time or another supported many heinous human actions and organized violence against others, even within the same tradition. Many atrocities have been committed in the name of those religions. \n \n While it is often argued that religion despite whatever may be its shortcomings or flaws or faults does at least instill a morality or a community ethos without which social life and civilized life would not be possible. Against this claim there are a growing number of people who would argue that a morality resting on a religious faith that is founded on nothing but faith in the hope of securing a better life after a life on earth is a morality that fosters within people a sense of meanness towards others and even a selfishness in a concern for personal salvation. Such a morality does its worst on humans when it encourages a faith upon which it rests that is a faith that is held without or beyond reason and evidence to support it. Such a morality is inclined to be one that is without a degree of sensitivity for nuance and for critical and reflective thought. It is a morality of literal interpretation and simple minded applications. It is a morality of tradition that finds it very difficult to adapt to changes in the physical and social environments and to incorporate advances of science and technology into its moral schema. This morality is one that resists adaptation to progress. Slavery, the subjugation of women, just and holy war theory, the inequality of social classes are all supported by such morality.\n \n Morality founded upon the hope of survival of the death of the body and eternal life is a morality that has at its base a number of difficulties. It is founded on a reward-punishment approach to morality that is rather simplistic and childlike. If there is a situation for which there is no punishment does that make it permissible? If the motive for doing what is morally good is the hope of eternal life then what happens when a) there is no proof that there is such a life? b) the idea of an eternal life becomes less positive and more negative as people realize that an infinite amount of time is an idea that drains meaning out of the value of human life?\n \n It is sometimes thought that the religions of the East are more spiritual and contemplative and thus more innocuous and perhaps more humane than those of the West. The record indicates otherwise. There are cases too numerous in the East of atrocities and of human insensitivity to match those in the West. Even within the traditions of Buddhism there have been tales of physical violence on massive scales for over two thousand years.\n \n In the light of the horrors perpetrated by or in the name of religion alternatives are sought for the ethical principles found in religious traditions. The non-religious or secular alternatives are sought through the use of human reason, a universal resource. A view of morality that is founded on reasoning and a naturalistic worldview is thought to be more dependable and more capable of being universalized than is any set of principles that are dependent on religious worldviews. There are people at work on developing or applying such secular ethical principles to their lives and attempting to develop and maintain a social life under such principles. Secular humanists are such people along with those who make their moral decisions based on principles such as those developed by philosophers like Mill and Kant and Rawls.\n \n Some might argue that for the most part secular ethics have already replaced religious ethics in everyday practice. It could be concluded that most people who claim that their ethical principle is one that is rooted in some religious tradition are actually in practice operating from another ethical principle altogether. One of the most common such principles is that of ethical egoism whereby decisions are made based on what is thought to be in the best interests of the person making the decision and one that most satisfies the interests of that actor whatever those interests may be.\n \n This is most true of people in developed nations with advanced information technologies and communications and entertainment systems. There has been a \"secularization\" of daily behavior in such locations for some time. The operative moral base or ethical principle employed in such settings by most people is not a religion based ethic nor does it come from a deity. It is the secular principle of ethical egoism. Philosophers and moralists such as secular humanists have been working on the promotion of an alternative ethical base, such as based on caring for other human beings.\n \n Caring to produce the satisfaction of the interests of the greatest possible number of humans when making moral choices is at the base of the ethical tradition known as Utilitarianism\n \n Recently there has been the growing movement of secularists (non-religious peoples) to develop a moral foundation for a social order that is progressive and life affirming. The Council for Secular Humanism has its The Affirmations of Humanism: A Statement of Principles available for examination and consideration. There are other such groups as the Ethical Culture Societies promoting ethical principles that are not based on any religion as a basis for ordering social life. \"Ethical Culture is a humanistic religious and educational movement inspired by the ideal that the supreme aim of human life is working to create a more humane society.\"\n \n There are therefore examples of societies and cultures that have moral codes without a belief in a deity and there are efforts to establish a moral order that is not founded on religion. Their efficacy as compared to moral traditions stemming from or dependent upon some religious tradition remains to be determined.\n \n Here is one study that indicates that secular societies may have less violent crimes:\n \n Cross-National Correlations of Quantifiable Societal Health with Popular Religiosity and Secularism in the Prosperous Democracies: A First Look by Gregory S. Paul, Baltimore, Maryland Journal of Religion & Society Volume 7 (2005) ISSN 1522-5658 \n \n http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/pdf/2005-11.pdf\n \n Abstract\n \n Large-scale surveys show dramatic declines in religiosity in favor of secularization in the developed democracies. Popular acceptance of evolutionary science correlates negatively with levels of religiosity, and the United States is the only prosperous nation where the majority absolutely believes in a creator and evolutionary science is unpopular. Abundant data is available on rates of societal dysfunction and health in the first world. Cross-national comparisons of highly differing rates of religiosity and societal conditions form a mass epidemiological experiment that can be used to test whether high rates of belief in and worship of a creator are necessary for high levels of social health. Data correlations show that in almost all regards the highly secular democracies consistently enjoy low rates of societal dysfunction, while pro-religious and antievolution America performs poorly.\n \n Societies worse off \"when they have God on their side\" By Ruth Gledhill, Religion Correspondent The Times, UK September 27, 2005:\n RELIGIOUS belief can cause damage to a society, contributing towards high murder rates, abortion, sexual promiscuity and suicide, according to research published today. According to the study, belief in and worship of God are not only unnecessary for a healthy society but may actually contribute to social problems. The study counters the view of believers that religion is necessary to provide the moral and ethical foundations of a healthy society.It compares the social performance of relatively secular countries, such as Britain, with the US, where the majority believes in a creator rather than the theory of evolution. Many conservative evangelicals in the US consider Darwinism to be a social evil, believing that it inspires atheism and amorality. Many liberal Christians and believers of other faiths hold that religious belief is socially beneficial, believing that it helps to lower rates of violent crime, murder, suicide, sexual promiscuity and abortion. The benefits of religious belief to a society have been described as its \"spiritual capital\". But the study claims that the devotion of many in the US may actually contribute to its ills.The paper, published in the Journal of Religion and Society, a US academic journal, reports: \"Many Americans agree that their churchgoing nation is an exceptional, God-blessed, shining city on the hill that stands as an impressive example for an increasingly skeptical world.\"In general, higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy and abortion in the prosperous democracies. \"The United States is almost always the most dysfunctional of the developing democracies, sometimes spectacularly so.\"Gregory Paul, the author of the study and a social scientist, used data from the International Social Survey Programme, Gallup and other research bodies to reach his conclusions. He compared social indicators such as murder rates, abortion, suicide and teenage pregnancy. The study concluded that the US was the world's only prosperous democracy where murder rates were still high, and that the least devout nations were the least dysfunctional. Mr Paul said that rates of gonorrhoea in adolescents in the US were up to 300 times higher than in less devout democratic countries. The US also suffered from \"uniquely high\" adolescent and adult syphilis infection rates, and adolescent abortion rates, the study suggested.Mr Paul said: \"The study shows that England, despite the social ills it has, is actually performing a good deal better than the USA in most indicators, even though it is now a much less religious nation than America.\"He said that the disparity was even greater when the US was compared with other countries, including France, Japan and the Scandinavian countries. These nations had been the most successful in reducing murder rates, early mortality, sexually transmitted diseases and abortion, he added.Mr Paul delayed releasing the study until now because of Hurricane Katrina. He said that the evidence accumulated by a number of different studies suggested that religion might actually contribute to social ills. \"I suspect that Europeans are increasingly repelled by the poor societal performance of the Christian states,\" he added.He said that most Western nations would become more religious only if the theory of evolution could be overturned and the existence of God scientifically proven. Likewise, the theory of evolution would not enjoy majority support in the US unless there was a marked decline in religious belief, Mr Paul said.\"The non-religious, pro-evolution democracies contradict the dictum that a society cannot enjoy good conditions unless most citizens ardently believe in a moral creator.\"The widely held fear that a Godless citizenry must experience societal disaster is therefore refuted.\"\n",

   "That's what morals are. They ARE evolutionary instincts that allow us to be a social species. If we went around murdering, raping, and stealing then no one would feel safe living in a community and we would all go out on our own to fend for ourselves. \n\n \n So you denigrate religion for doing things 'cause God tells 'em to, but then you do things because your genes and overall society causes you to do it. 6 of 1, half of the other. You anti-theists claim religious people act moral only because God told 'em to (which is a disingenuous, unfair, and dishonest over-simplification of an accusation, by the way), but is it any better that you chalk up your morality as having evolved for nothing more than the preservation of society?? No, it's not.\n \n Your whole premise about morality only coming about this way is a classic example of begging the question. \n \n \nMy whole point is that Christians claim to have a perfect moral code from God. If God himself is not moral in the human sense, then his moral code is useless to us as a society.\n\n \n Your whole way of thinking here leaves out a HUGE 900 lb elephant in the room: that God is under NO obligation to anyone to adhere to human-being-level moral rules he made for HUMANS. For the eternal being who knows the future of the human race and whole universe? Nah, I think he gets a pass on that. \n \n Let me use an analogy to help you understand this. Let's say a person owns a plexiglass ant farm. He takes care of the ants. Every now and then he does have to cull the colony a bit, but the ants get along pretty well overall. They've never actually laid eyes on their owner--he's too far away from their limited field of vision. But does the owner of the ants have to ALSO live in a plexiglass ant-farm enclosure HIMSELF just because he expects his ants to? No. He doesn't. He's exempt from those expectations, because he's the ant owner and can do what he wants (equivalent to God, in a relative sense). Now, if the ants could think thusly, they might get mad that the Great Ant-Owner in the Sky doesn't enclose himself TOO in a plexiglass ant-farm and force the same restrictions on himself that he does the lowly ants! They might get bitter, stomp around, and even stop believing in the Great Ant Owner in the Sky because ... dang it ... he must be a hypocrite!!! They might even start espousing the idea that Ownerism ('theism) is the root of all wars and problems in the history of the ant colony and use any chance they get to say how much they think that believing in the Great Owner is, well, stupid. (And in the end, all that pouting meant nothing, because the ants finish out their days in the plexiglass ant farm, owned by the Great Ant Owner in the Sky. :)\n \n \nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\n \n That's why. Certain things like murder, rape, and stealing are wrong for obvious reasons, and need to be controlled to establish a safe society. But laws that do nothing but enforce a religious view, such as the view that homosexuality is immoral or that drinking or gambling is immoral (and I'm not talking about drinking and driving), obeying the Sabbath, swearing on a bible, etc. have no place.\n\n \n How the heck do such laws 'establish religion', exactly?? (Hint, they don't) The establishment clause clearly means, well, laws intended to ESTABLISH religion. Not regulation. However, I'll agree with you that laws can go too far sometimes. But I don't agree with you that Christians shouldn't be influenced by their religion in their work in government. That's not a fair application of the 1st Amendment.\n \n \nFirst of all, atheism was not the cause of any of those atrocities. You don't do something because of a lack of belief in something.\n\n \n Well, my opinion is that the modern movement of people like yourself that you refer to as 'atheism' has gone way beyond merely some benign 'lack of belief.' If that's all it was, people like XCalibre and MrWriteLA wouldn't be hanging out message forums day and night preaching the horribles of religion. The more accurate term for the Hitchens movement is 'anti-theism', not 'atheism'.\n \n \nWrong again. I'm living proof that a person can break the binds of religion. I lived the life of a Christian for 32 years, was a devout Christian. But Things happened in my life that made me start asking questions, and when I found the answers my eyes were opened to reality and I left religion to salvage what was left of my one and only Life ....\n ... I think it is a sad thing for anyone to be caught up in a religion that teaches people not to think for themselves. \n\n \n And there are people like C.S. Lewis and and others--MANY others--who went the other direction and started asking questions, only to find their eyes were opened to theism. Why on earth should I believe you over them? Some of these people were great thinkers, so certainly religion doesn't mean 'not thinking for oneself'? Again, why should I believe you over them?\n \n \nAnd what \"Values\" do I espouse that are so wicked ? That's the Problem with Religion. Most religious people somehow think that their Values and Morals are better than non religious people.. that's Arrogance.\n\n \n Take a step back and look at what you're doing here: by equating religion with ignorance and yourself as having 'your eyes opened' by being atheist, you're associating your values (atheism) with superiority. Ironically, you're doing the very thing you are denigrating theists for. The only one here I see doing that is you.\n \n \nThese men were all Religious at one point, And anything they did to Cause suffering was done so out of religious beliefs. Religious Factions have labeled them Atheists because the Religious just can't have people thinking a \"Good Christian\" could do such things...\n\n \n Hate to break it to ya, but almost everyone is theist in some way. Your problem is that you engage in a false causality here--assocation does not equal cause. Classic logical fallacy.",

   "More Einstein:\n \n Albert Einstein \"Religion and Science,\" 1956\nEverything that the human race has done and thought is concerned with the satisfaction of felt needs and the assuagement of pain. One has to keep this constantly in mind if one wishes to understand spiritual movements and their development. Feeling and desire are the motive forces behind all human endeavour and human creation, in however exalted a guise the latter may present itself to us. Now what are the feelings and needs that have led men to religious thought and belief in the widest sense of the words? A little consideration will suffice to show us that the most varying emotions preside over the birth of religious thought and experience. With primitive man it is above all fear that evokes religious notions-fear of hunger, wild beasts, sickness, death. Since at this stage of existence understanding of causal connexions is usually poorly developed, the human mind creates for itself more or less analogous beings on whose wills and actions these fearful happenings depend. One's object now is to secure the favour of these beings by carrying out actions and offering sacrifices which, according to the tradition handed down from generation to generation, propitiate them or make them well disposed towards a mortal.\n \n I am speaking now of the religion of fear. This, though not created, is in an important degree stabilized by the formation of a special priestly caste which sets up as a mediator between the people and the beings they fear, and erects a hegemony on this basis. In many cases the leader or ruler whose position depends on other factors, or a privileged class, combines priestly functions with its secular authority in order to make the latter more secure; or the political rulers and the priestly caste make common cause in their own interests.\n \n The social feelings are another source of the crystallization of religion. Fathers and mothers and the leaders of larger human communities are mortal and fallible. The desire for guidance, love, and support prompts men to form the social or moral conception of God. This is the God of Providence who protects, disposes, rewards, and punishes, the God who, according to the width of the believer's outlook, loves and cherishes the life of the tribe or of the human race, or even life as such, the comforter in sorrow and unsatisfied longing, who preserves the souls of the dead. This is the social or moral conception of God.\n \n The Jewish scriptures admirably illustrate the development from the religion of fear to moral religion, which is continued in the New Testament. The religions of all civilized peoples, especially the peoples of the Orient, are primarily moral religions. The development from a religion of fear to moral religion is a great step in a nation's life. That primitive religions are based entirely on fear and the religions of civilized peoples purely on morality is a prejudice against which we must be on our guard. The truth is that they are all intermediate types, with this reservation, that on the higher levels of social life the religion of morality predominates.\n \n Common to all these types is the anthropomorphic character of their conception of God. Only individuals of exceptional endowments and exceptionally high-minded communities, as a general rule, get in any real sense beyond this level. But there is a third state of religious experience which belongs to all of them, even though it is rarely found in a pure form, and which I will call cosmic religious feeling. It is very difficult to explain this feeling to anyone who is entirely without it, especially as there is no anthropomorphic conception of God corresponding to it.\n \n The individual feels the nothingness of human desires and aims and the sublimity and marvellous order which reveal themselves both in nature and in the world of thought. He looks upon individual existence as a sort of prison and wants to experience the universe as a single significant whole. The beginnings of cosmic religious feeling already appear in earlier stages of development-e.g., in many of the Psalms of David and in some of the Prophets. Buddhism, as we have learnt from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer especially, contains a much stronger element of it.\n \n The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man's image; so that there can be no Church whose central teachings are based on it. Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with the highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as Atheists, sometimes also as saints. Looked at in this light, men like Democritus, Francis of Assisi, and Spinoza are closely akin to one another.\n \n How can cosmic religious feeling be communicated from one person to another, if it can give rise to no definite notion of a God and no theology? In my view, it is the most important function of art and science to awaken this feeling and keep it alive in those who are capable of it. We thus arrive at a conception of the relation of science to religion very different from the usual one. When one views the matter historically one is inclined to look upon science and religion as irreconcilable antagonists, and for a very obvious reason. The man who is thoroughly convinced of the universal operation of the law of causation cannot for a moment entertain the idea of a being who interferes in the course of events-that is, if he takes the hypothesis of causality really seriously. He has no use for the religion of fear and equally little for social or moral religion. A God who rewards and punishes is inconceivable to him for the simple reason that a man's actions are determined by necessity, external and internal, so that in God's eyes he cannot be responsible, any more than an inanimate object is responsible for the motions it goes through. Hence science has been charged with undermining morality, but the charge is unjust. A man's ethical behaviour should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear and punishment and hope of reward after death.\n \n It is therefore easy to see why the Churches have always fought science and persecuted its devotees. On the other hand, I maintain that cosmic religious feeling is the strongest and noblest incitement to scientific research. Only those who realize the immense efforts and, above all, the devotion which pioneer work in theoretical science demands, can grasp the strength of the emotion out of which alone such work, remote as it is from the immediate realities of life, can issue. What a deep conviction of the rationality of the universe and what a yearning to understand, were it but a feeble reflection of the mind revealed in this world, Kepler and Newton must have had to enable them to spend years of solitary labour in disentangling the principles of celestial mechanics!\n \n Those whose acquaintance with scientific research is derived chiefly from its practical results easily develop a completely false notion of the mentality of the men who, surrounded by a sceptical world, have shown the way to those like-minded with themselves, scattered through the earth and the centuries. Only one who has devoted his life to similar ends can have a vivid realization of what has inspired these men and given them the strength to remain true to their purpose in spite of countless failures. It is cosmic religious feeling that gives a man strength of this sort. A contemporary has said, not unjustly, that in this materialistic age of ours the serious scientific workers are the only profoundly religious people.\n \n You will hardly and one among the profounder sort of scientific minds without a peculiar religious feeling of his own. But it is different from the religion of the naive man. For the latter God is a being from whose care one hopes to benefit and whose punishment one fears; a sublimation of a feeling similar to that of a child for its father, a being to whom one stands to some extent in a personal relation, however deeply it may be tinged with awe.\n \n But the scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation. The future, to him, is every whit as necessary and determined as the past. There is nothing divine about morality, it is a purely human affair. His religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection. This feeling is the guiding principle of his life and work, in so far as he succeeds in keeping himself from the shackles of selfish desire. It is beyond question closely akin to that which has possessed the religious geniuses of all ages.\n \n (Albert Einstein, The World as I See It, Secaucus, New Jersey: The Citadel Press, 1999, pp. 24-29.)",

   "A great article!\n \n Does Morality Require God?\n \n \nMorality Requires God ... or Does It?\n by Theodore Schick, Jr.\n \n The following article is from Free Inquiry magazine, Volume 17, Number 3.\n \n Although Plato demonstrated the logical independence of God and morality over 2,000 years ago in the Euthyphro, the belief that morality requires God remains a widely held moral maxim. In particular, it serves as the basic assumption of the Christian fundamentalist's social theory. Fundamentalists claim that all of society's ills - everything from AIDS to out-of-wedlock pregnancies - are the result of a breakdown in morality and that this breakdown is due to a decline in the belief of God. Although many fundamentalists trace the beginning of this decline to the publication of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species in 1859, others trace it to the Supreme Court's 1963 decision banning prayer in the classroom. In an attempt to neutralize these purported sources of moral decay, fundamentalists across America are seeking to restore belief in God by promoting the teaching of creationism and school prayer.\n \n The belief that morality requires God is not limited to theists, however. Many atheists subscribe to it as well. The existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre, for example, says that \"If God is dead, everything is permitted.\" In other words, if there is no supreme being to lay down the moral law, each individual is free to do as he or she pleases. Without a divine lawgiver, there can be no universal moral law.\n \n The view that God creates the moral law is often called the \"Divine Command Theory of Ethics.\" According to this view, what makes an action right is that God wills it to be done. That an agnostic should find this theory suspect is obvious, for, if one doesn't believe in God or if one is unsure which God is the true God, being told that one must do as God commands will not help one solve any moral dilemmas. What is not so obvious is that theists should find this theory suspect, too, for it is inconsistent with a belief in God. The upshot is that both the fundamentalists and the existentialists are mistaken about what morality requires.\n \n The Arbitrary Lawgiver\n \n To better understand the import of the Divine Command Theory, consider the following tale. It seems that, when Moses came down from the mountain with the tablets containing the Ten Commandments, his followers asked him what they revealed about how they should live their lives. Moses told them, \"I have some good news and some bad news.\"\n \n \"Give us the good news first,\" they said.\n \n \"Well, the good news,\" Moses responded, \"is that he kept the number of commandments down to ten.\"\n \n \"Okay, what's the bad news?\" they inquired.\n \n \"The bad news,\" Moses replied, \"is that he kept the one about adultery in there.\"\n \n The point is that, according to Divine Command Theory, nothing is right or wrong unless God makes it so. Whatever God says goes. So if God had decreed that adultery was permissible, then adultery would be permissible.\n \n Let's take this line of reasoning to its logical conclusion. If the Divine Command Theory were true, then the Ten Commandments could have gone something like this: \"Thou shalt kill everyone you dislike. Thou shalt rape every woman you desire. Thou shalt steal everything you covet. Thou shalt torture innocent children in your spare time. ...\" The reason that this is possible is that killing, raping, stealing, and torturing were not wrong before God made them so. Since God is free to establish whatever set of moral principles he chooses, he could just as well have chosen this set as any other.\n \n Many would consider this a reductio ad absurdum of the Divine Command Theory, for it is absurd to think that such wanton killing, raping, stealing, and torturing could be morally permissible. Moreover, to believe that God could have commanded these things is to destroy whatever grounds one might have for praising or worshiping him. Leibniz, in his Discourse on Metaphysics, explains:\n In saying, therefore, that things are not good according to any standard of goodness, but simply by the will of God, it seems to me that one destroys, without realizing it, all the love of God and all his glory; for why praise him for what he has done, if he would be equally praiseworthy in doing the contrary? Where will be his justice and his wisdom if he has only a certain despotic power, if arbitrary will takes the place of reasonableness, and if in accord with the definition of tyrants, justice consists in that which is pleasing to the most powerful? Besides it seems that every act of willing supposes some reason for the willing and this reason, of course, must precede the act.\n Leibniz's point is that, if things are neither right nor wrong independently of God's will, then God cannot choose one thing over another because it is right. Thus, if he does choose one over another, his choice must be arbitrary. But a being whose decisions are arbitrary is not a being worthy of worship.\n \n The fact that Leibniz rejects the Divine Command Theory is significant, for he is one of the most committed theists in the Western intellectual tradition. He argues at great length that there must be an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good God and consequently that this must be the best of all possible worlds, for such a God could create nothing less. Ever since Voltaire lampooned this view in Candide, it has been difficult to espouse with a straight face. Nevertheless, what Leibniz demonstrates is that, far from being disrespectful or heretical, the view that morality is independent of God is an eminently sensible and loyal one for a theist to hold.\n \n An Empty Theory\n \n To avoid the charge of absurdity, a Divine Command theorist might try to deny that the situation described above is possible. He might argue, for example, that God would never condone such killing, raping, stealing, and torturing, for God is all-good. But to make such a claim is to render the theory vacuous. The Divine Command Theory is a theory of the nature of morality. As such, it tells us what makes something good by offering a definition of morality. But if goodness is a defining attribute of God, then God cannot be used to define goodness, for, in that case, the definition would be circular - the concept being defined would be doing the defining - and such a definition would be uninformative. If being all-good is an essential property of God, then all the Divine Command Theory tells us is that good actions would be willed by a supremely good being. While this is certainly true, it is unenlightening. For it does not tell us what makes something good and hence does not increase our understanding of the nature of morality.\n \n A Divine Command theorist might try to avoid this circularity by denying that goodness is a defining attribute of God. But this would take him from the frying pan into the fire, for if goodness is not an essential property of God, then there is no guarantee that what he wills will be good. Even if God is all-powerful and all-knowing, it does not follow that he is all-good, for, as the story of Satan is supposed to teach us, one can be powerful and intelligent without being good. Thus the Divine Command Theory faces a dilemma: if goodness is a defining attribute of God, the theory is circular, but if it is not a defining attribute, the theory is false. In either case, the Divine Command Theory cannot be considered a viable theory of morality.\n \n The foregoing considerations indicate that it is unreasonable to believe that an action is right because God wills it to be done. One can plausibly believe that God wills an action to be done because it is right, but to believe this is to believe that the rightness of an action is independent of God. In any event, the view that the moral law requires a divine lawgiver is untenable.\n \n God the Enforcer\n \n There are those who maintain, however, that even if God is not required as the author of the moral law, he is nevertheless required as the enforcer of it, for without the threat of divine punishment, people will not act morally. But this position is no more plausible than the Divine Command Theory itself.\n \n In the first place, as an empirical hypothesis about the psychology of human beings, it is questionable. There is no unambiguous evidence that theists are more moral than nontheists. Not only have psychological studies failed to find a significant correlation between frequency of religious worship and moral conduct, but convicted criminals are much more likely to be theists than atheists.\n \n Second, the threat of divine punishment cannot impose a moral obligation, for might does not make right. Threats extort; they do not create a moral duty. Thus, if our only reason for obeying God is the fear of punishment if we do not, then, from a moral point of view, God has no more claim to our allegiance than Hitler or Stalin.\n \n Moreover, since self-interest is not an adequate basis for morality, there is reason to believe that heaven and hell cannot perform the regulative function often attributed to them. Heaven and hell are often construed as the carrot and stick that God uses to make us toe the line. Heaven is the reward that good people get for being good, and hell is the punishment that bad people get for being bad. But consider this. Good people do good because they want to do good - not because they will personally benefit from it or because someone has forced them to do it. People who do good solely for personal gain or to avoid personal harm are not good people. Someone who saves a drowning child, for example, only because he was offered a reward or was physically threatened does not deserve our praise. Thus, if your only reason for performing good actions is your desire to go to heaven or your fear of going to hell - if all your other-regarding actions are motivated purely by self-interest - then you should go to hell because you are not a good person. An obsessive concern with either heaven or hell should actually lessen one's chances for salvation rather than increase them.\n \n Fundamentalists correctly perceive that universal moral standards are required for the proper functioning of society. But they erroneously believe that God is the only possible source of such standards. Philosophers as diverse as Plato, Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, George Edward Moore, and John Rawls have demonstrated that it is possible to have a universal morality without God. Contrary to what the fundamentalists would have us believe, then, what our society really needs is not more religion but a richer notion of the nature of morality.\n",

   "This guy also has a series of thought-provoking and witty essays on his site, of which this is just one. Recommended.\n \nGod as a Moral Signpost\n \n There is an argument that ethical atheists and agnostics should shut up, not because \"there are some things man is not meant to know\", but because God is a convenient deterrent, a sort of bogeyman preventing crime and immorality.\n \n Though God may effectively have served this purpose in past centuries (especially in the Middle Ages, when most people believed in a fierce, interventive personal God), God has faded too much to be effective in this manner today.\n \n Most of the people I meet who insist that they believe in God seem to need a benign presence in the background and never relate any of the daily conundrums and decisions of their life to him. This is the God of courtrooms (\"In God we rust\", reads the memorable inscription in one New York City courtroom) and coins, as comforting and meaningless to us as \"E Pluribus Unum.\"\n \n My evidence is only anecdotal. I don't know any fundamentalists, Christian or Islamic; millenarians; snake handlers; Branch Davidians or Seventh Day Adventists. But in general, I think there are a number of reasons why God is not needed--or effective--as a moral stopsign in our society.\n [*]People who love God are not the ones we are worried about. Calm and charity may be conducive to a love of God, rather than the other way around. Is there a would-be Ted Bundy out there who would have murdered fifty people by now, but for the fear of God?\n \n [*]God has served about as often as a catalyst for immoral acts as a deterrent to them. During the Middle Ages--the last period when God may have been at all effective as a moral deterrent--there was nonetheless immense bloodshed carried out in his name. Today, numerous factions continue to involve God in their violence (including American priests calling for the murder of abortion doctors.) A signpost is only effective when it always faces the same way; a sign which can swing like a weather-vane--now calling for peace, now for violence--doesn't stand for anything. If we could all agree on the rules, God might be an effective signpost; but, if we could all agree on the rules, we might not need God.\n \n [*]Without God, all is not permitted. Since the Bible's \"render unto Caesar\" and \"Do unto others\", since the first formulation of \"God helps those who help themselves,\" we have recognized that God is no substitute for human compassion and justice. The two systems, God's and man's, have always coexisted. Since, as the Prisoner's Dilemma proves, the most effective deterrent is prompt retaliation, more of us refrain from stealing or killing due to the fear of imprisonment or execution than the fear of God. If you could pick just one of the two systems to live under, in the complete absence of the other, you would do well to pick human justice. It's imperfect but at least it's tangible, and faster and more apparent than God's justice.As I address in [my] final essay, human morality exists, and exists without God, for other reasons than the fear of punishment. It is safe to say that ethical atheists and agnostics do not have a duty to shut up; influencing people away from God does not need to influence them away from morality.\n",

As I said above, that's got to be one of the most disingenuous and unfair accusations I ever hear against religion. As if theism AND doing things out of compassion can't go hand-in-hand. They most certainly can and often DO, it's fallacious and erroneous to assert that just because religion is present as motivation, compassion is NOT present.",

   "Related to this \"God as Threatening Invisible Daddy Wielding a Flaming Yardstick\" idea, I think, is the predisposition these Fundies (at least ones who frequent this forum) have shown towards Authoritarianism... \nFundamentally Aware Issue 10\n \n Authoritarianism, the practice of requiring blind obedience, has been widely recognized by scholars as another common feature among fundamentalists. One can certainly be fundamentalist without being authoritarian and vice versa. And it is uncertain whether authoritarians mask as fundamentalists or fundamentalism leads to an authoritarian personality. Regardless, there is a high incidence of the two traits combined. This is seen as women and children have few, if any rights in many fundamentalist homes, based on a literal reading of the Bible in which men have all authority. God, identified in the Bible as male, issues the laws, and men interpret and enforce them. All civilized societies recognize the need for rules. Yet, Christian fundamentalists believe the rules they impose have been handed down from God and obedience to such rules must be maintained. Their authoritarian personality helps explain why fundamentalists believe society must conform to their rigid views. At the same time, the nature of authoritarianism assists in understanding some of the personality traits common to fundamentalists.\n \n Gary Leak and Brandy Randall in the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion (1995) found that those who score high on the Rightwing Authoritarianism scale have several tendencies. They are likely \"to aggress against unpopular or unconventional groups, feel morally superior and self-righteous,\" and \"possess a mean-spiritedness that is coupled with vindictiveness.\"[i] They often take \"'secret pleasure' when others experience misfortune and appear prejudiced toward out-groups.\"[ii] These negative traits are commonly seen in fundamentalists... \nGee, sound like anyone we know?",

   "So you denigrate religion for doing things 'cause God tells 'em to, but then you do things because your genes and overall society causes you to do it. 6 of 1, half of the other. You anti-theists claim religious people act moral only because God told 'em to (which is a disingenuous, unfair, and dishonest over-simplification of an accusation, by the way), but is it any better that you chalk up your morality as having evolved for nothing more than the preservation of society?? No, it's not.\n \n Your whole premise about morality only coming about this way is a classic example of begging the question. \n\n \n I don't think I've ever made the claim that theists only do things that God tells them. I think that is an oversimplification of the truth, however, that is exactly what is implied when a theist claims that a non-theist can't have morals (I'm not saying that you've said that, but I've heard religious people say that many times). \n \n I also never said that we obey morals only on evolutionary instinct. I meant that the reason we have certain basic morals (such as violence and stealing) is because without them societies and civilizations would be highly unstable. That doesn't explain every person's actions. There are still good people and bad people. There are still people who use compassion, empathize, and generally care about other people. \n \n You mentioned animals not \"consciously engaging in some moral code.\" That's kind of the same thing I am talking about with early human societies. In order to survive together, they had to act a certain way. \n \n And honestly, I don't care whose morality is 'better.' If you do good things then that's great; I don't really care about your motivation. \n \n \nYour whole way of thinking here leaves out a HUGE 900 lb elephant in the room: that God is under NO obligation to anyone to adhere to human-being-level moral rules he made for HUMANS. For the eternal being who knows the future of the human race and whole universe? Nah, I think he gets a pass on that. \n \n Let me use an analogy to help you understand this. Let's say a person owns a plexiglass ant farm. He takes care of the ants. Every now and then he does have to cull the colony a bit, but the ants get along pretty well overall. They've never actually laid eyes on their owner--he's too far away from their limited field of vision. But does the owner of the ants have to ALSO live in a plexiglass ant-farm enclosure HIMSELF just because he expects his ants to? No. He doesn't. He's exempt from those expectations, because he's the ant owner and can do what he wants (equivalent to God, in a relative sense). Now, if the ants could think thusly, they might get mad that the Great Ant-Owner in the Sky doesn't enclose himself TOO in a plexiglass ant-farm and force the same restrictions on himself that he does the lowly ants! They might get bitter, stomp around, and even stop believing in the Great Ant Owner in the Sky because ... dang it ... he must be a hypocrite!!! They might even start espousing the idea that Ownerism ('theism) is the root of all wars and problems in the history of the ant colony and use any chance they get to say how much they think that believing in the Great Owner is, well, stupid. (And in the end, all that pouting meant nothing, because the ants finish out their days in the plexiglass ant farm, owned by the Great Ant Owner in the Sky. :)\n\n \n But God basically did \"live in the ant farm\" in biblical times. He directly chose a group of people, spoke to them through their leaders, and led them on a genocide adventure. \n \n That's not even the point. If God meddles in human affairs and claims to be an authority on human morality, he can be judged as such. Does he have to answer to anyone? No. But as far as human morality goes, he has an extremely cruel track record. By human standards, he is an immoral, hypocritical tyrant with the suffering and blood of millions on his hands. \n \n \nHow the heck do such laws 'establish religion', exactly?? (Hint, they don't) The establishment clause clearly means, well, laws intended to ESTABLISH religion. Not regulation. However, I'll agree with you that laws can go too far sometimes. But I don't agree with you that Christians shouldn't be influenced by their religion in their work in government. That's not a fair application of the 1st Amendment.\n\n \n They certainly do. Laws restricting what businesses can sell on a Sunday is forcing them to recognize the Christian day of worship. Laws telling people what they can and can't do in the privacy of their own home, and censorship of media are also enforcing religion on people. These most certainly respect the establishment of religion. \n \n \nAnd there are people like C.S. Lewis and and others--MANY others--who went the other direction and started asking questions, only to find their eyes were opened to theism. Why on earth should I believe you over them? Some of these people were great thinkers, so certainly religion doesn't mean 'not thinking for oneself'? Again, why should I believe you over them?\n\n \n Of course someone who was once an atheist could become a theist. Religion can bring hope, comfort, and a feeling of peace to people, and the fear of the unknown can be very persuasive in bringing people to religion. However, a lot of these people listed as agnostics think it is equally likely that a god may or may not exist. That's a very different point of view than that of an atheist. \n \n That being said, you shouldn't just 'believe' anyone. Do some research and look for evidence. \n \n \nHate to break it to ya, but almost everyone is theist in some way. Your problem is that you engage in a false causality here--assocation does not equal cause. Classic logical fallacy.\n\n \n I don't see how atheists can be theists in any way.",

These most certainly respect the establishment of religion.\n \n \n Blue laws are pretty much either a.) a thing of the past, or b.) rarely ever really enforced, at least here in the U.S., for the very reasons you bring up. I don't disagree with you that these things are undesirable in terms of laws (I'm a libertarian for the most part, after all.) However I don't agree they constitute 'forcing religion' on people. I think that phrase should constitutionally be reserved for cases that force someone to worship a certain way, for instance. That was the context it was written in, after all, when the founding fathers of the U.S. left Great Britain. They likely didn't mean we should somehow have a government sanitized of any religious influence whatsoever (which is an impossible task, IMO).",

   "A great article!\n \n Does Morality Require God?\n\n \n Not to rain on your parade but surely you can see the many logical fallacies in this article you posted. The basic argument the author seems to be making is that you can't say God is good and therefore only does good things but at the same time the author claims that certain things are wrong because they are wrong. That may take awhile to set in but think about and you will see that the author basically commits what he faults later in the article. \n \n I have to apologize that I don't have much time to further respond but I'd be happy to if you'd like.",

   "Frankly, I don't know that I've EVER heard any theist say than a non-theist can't have morals, that I recall. In my experience religious people are well aware that morals are not religious-only and that there are non-theists out there who act in a good way.\n\n \n I heard my own mother once say she wasn't sure if an atheist could be a moral person. Rabbi Marc Rubenstein is a guy who once said that atheists couldn't be moral, just, or intelligent. \n \n I think you are right, though. Most theists would never make that type of ridiculous claim. I think the claim would be that they are less moral. Of course part of that could be due to a different view of morality on a lot of issues (drinking, premarital sex, homosexuality, cursing, etc.) I have also heard them say that even atheists' morals and conscience still come from God.\n \n \n \nHe can be '\"judged\" in the sense of a human having an opinion of the Deity, but only in a way that carries no weight whatsoever, to the point where it's completely irrelevant that some might 'judge' God. A defendant or plaintiff in a court case can 'judge' the judge as well, but it matters not one iota. The only one who's judgment carries any weight whatsoever is the judge himself. So I'm really not sure it matters, frankly.\n\n \n Right. Like I said, that opinion wouldn't matter in the end, but what it means is that maybe God's moral laws (such as blasphemy and sexual laws) aren't in the best interest of life on earth. It also effects whether a person finds that god worthy of worship. \n \n \nBlue laws are pretty much either a.) a thing of the past, or b.) rarely ever really enforced, at least here in the U.S., for the very reasons you bring up. I don't disagree with you that these things are undesirable in terms of laws (I'm a libertarian for the most part, after all.) However I don't agree they constitute 'forcing religion' on people.

That was the context it was written in, after all, when the founding fathers of the U.S. left Great Britain. They likely didn't mean we should somehow have a government sanitized of any religious influence whatsoever (which is an impossible task, IMO).\n\n \n Well, the ones I was mainly referring to (alcohol sales, hunting, etc. on Sunday) are still in full effect in the Bible Belt and other parts of the country. They don't force religion in the most extreme way, but they are still religious-based laws and should be done away with. \n \n We obviously have different opinions on a lot, but I think most of the stuff we are arguing over we've pretty much seemed to settle.",
