   "Steeeve - you are under the illusion that not killing people is due to some 'fundamental goodness' in the world. The reason we don't go out killing people is that in a group, someone who does that threatens individuals and the members of the group act to preserve themselves by dealing with the murderer. 'Morals' developed later due to a variety of similar but more complicated reasons. Pretty much all our laws exist to protect individuals (essentially yourself) you are willing to sacrifice freedoms to gain the protection of a group\n\n This explanation of the origin of morality relies on a \"State of Nature\" claim proposed by many social contract theorists. This argument begs the question in that it relies on the existence of such a state. In essence, the claim \"the reason we don't go out killing people is that in a group, someone who does that threatens individuals and the members of the group act to preserve themselves...\" has no base. It is merely a \"possible explanation\" that requires a hypothetical State of Nature.",

Here are the significant findings:\n \n http://www.tourolaw.edu/patch/Scott/\n 4. A free negro of the African race, whose ancestors were brought to this country and sold as slaves, is not a 'citizen' within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States.\n 5. When the Constitution was adopted, they were not regarded in any of the States as members of the community which constituted the State, and were not numbered among its 'people or citizens.' Consequently, the special rights and immunities guarantied to citizens do not apply to them. And not being 'citizens' within the meaning of the Constitution, they are not entitled to sue in that character in a court of the United States, and the Circuit Court has not jurisdiction in such a suit.\n 6. The only two clauses in the Constitution which point to this race, treat them as persons whom it was morally lawful to deal in as articles of property and to hold as slaves.\n 7. Since the adoption of the Constitution of the United States, no State can by any subsequent law make a foreigner or any other description of persons citizens of the United States, nor entitle them to the rights and privileges secured to citizens by that instrument.\n 8. A State, by its laws passed since the adoption of the Constitution, may put a foreigner or any other description of persons upon a footing with its own citizens, as to all the rights and privileges enjoyed by them within its dominion and by its laws. But that will not make him a citizen of the United States, nor entitle him to sue in its courts, nor to any of the privileges and immunities of a citizen in another State. \n \n Or in shorthand, a slave or decendant is not a citizen, even though a state passes a law stating that, and as such, Dred Scot did not have the right of protection against slavery that his chosen state had given him because \"When the Constitution was adopted, they were not regarded in any of the States as members of the community which constituted the State, and were not numbered among its 'people or citizens.' \"\n \n So your claim of the census counting having any significant bearing here is an outright falsehood.\n \n I do wish that you actually examined these things before making unfounded, outright false claims.",

That is lying.\n \nthis means I have the intent to give you wrong informtion that I know is wrong...how do you know that I know it is wrong assuming that it is? You don't.\nWhen I show a claim to be false and it is repeated, then it no longer is an opinion but rather an outright lie.
