Well their both liars. Not in their opinions no no their both way too clever for that.\n \n They are lying because they really don't have an opinion at all! These two are what we call trolls.

A person that harms for the enjoyment, attempts to cause a response, a person who will derail any topic or discussion for the sheer pleasure.\n \n Not only are these two trolls but they have effectively locked down this site to their posts. They will stop at nothing to greet new people and then we see the new users disappear due to the trolling.\n \n As a result this site has died. It has lost its reputation of being a worthy debate site compared to others BECAUSE of the result of trolling and users leaving.\n \n Also by the lack of any admin taking the initiative where in other forums these two would have been banned at the very beginning. Here is a perfect video describing EXACTLY what these two are.\n \n I also am making a stand saying that we should ignore these two. The whole board!

We have evidence. We have fact. The very laws that govern us now are evidence. There is no evidence a being made these laws since there is no physical evidence. \n \n Just another spellbound parlor trick to control people Archie. See you already say fall of man. We as little children are already brainwash to think we are bad. We need saving. We need something because we have this very primitive fear instilled in us by religion since the beginning. We are bound and brainwashed before we even realize it...\n \n There was no fall of man. There was a rise of man. Rise of intelligence and good Archie.

It is beyond you to grasp such a supernatural relationship. \n \n As I sit here right now at my Macbook, God is speaking to me and guiding what I am writing to you. I am never ever alone in life and He is never apart from me for even a second of time. Here's what Jesus promised before He went to glory.\n Jhn 14:16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;\n Jhn 14:26 But the Comforter, [which is] the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\n Jhn 15:26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, [even] the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:\n Jhn 16:7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.\n The Comforter is the Holy Spirit who dwells within each believer. He is our crimson chord that ties us to our heavenly Father for eternity. God knows me personally because He is connected to me personally through HIS OWN HOLY SPIRIT which indwells me all the days of my life. I hope you can come to first understand and then appreciate how awesome this supernatural relationship is. It is more incredible than one can fully put into words and describe.",

They will stop at nothing to greet new people and then we see the new users disappear due to the trolling.\n \n As a result this site has died. It has lost its reputation of being a worthy debate site compared to others BECAUSE of the result of trolling and users leaving.\n \n Also by the lack of any admin taking the initiative where in other forums these two would have been banned at the very beginning.

What a dork!\n I'm bi-sexual. I've been with a half a dozen women. And one was a white dance instructor, married to a physician, who wanted to \"keep\" me.

So don't you look stupid about right now? I know how to keep them coming back for \"more\". XXXXX.\n\n \n Look at who it is who's injecting race in every post here; it's the black racist homosexual who plays the race card at every turn in the hope of attacking anything we uppity whites dare say with your politically correct legalistic interpretations so as to condemn us with it as you attempt to get posters banned. \n \n You're the definition of a TROLL who brings nothing at all to this forum in the way of valid debate content.

Well, you've revealed yourself to be a racist, and a homophobe by simply pointing that out. Race card? What race card? Black people can hardly play the cards they wear on their skins. If everybody can see the card, how could it possibly played to any advantage? Duh. \n Uppity whites??? You're confused. The only thing that makes you think that you're superior or remotely 'uppity' is your white skin and your expectation of entitlement because of it. Delusion. \n And I certainly must be formidable, if you think I possess mystical powers and prowess enough to get you superior and hyper-intelligent beings 'banned'. Thank you. \n No, hometown...me, calling you on your racism and bigotry, does not a racist of me make. \n You're the definition of a TROLL who brings nothing at all to this forum in the way of valid debate content. All you offer and contribute is race baiting so as to falsely indict those you can't beat in honest debate, the tactics of a true hypocrite and philosophical coward of which you represent the undeniable definition of. \n \n \n Where is any evidence of any honest debate? All I've seen is ad hominem attacks and lies. Debate is from a long line of tradition and respectful intercourse. Lord knows that's beyond most of you here.

JP is far above you in intelligence and character it boggles my mind why he bothers to respond to your pathetic baiting. emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n What a cop out. Afraid?\n And oh, yeah, JP, he of the 140 I.Q. To listen to the both of you tell it, I wouldn't stand a chance. But ask him about how I \"played\" him at TPA...so much so, it got him banned...and I was so incensed by his attempt to \"get me\", I sought him out, and followed him here to inform him that the administration staff didn't ban me, and that he is a laughing stock. Ask David.\n And I've embarrassed him here, as well. Where is he? He ran away, because he's no match for me, as I've proven, beyond the shadow of a doubt. Neither are you. Only you don't know it yet. I eat conservatards for breakfast, lunch and dinner. My I.Q. is a verifiable 126, 98 % greater than the general population. I graduated in the top 15% of my high school class, and was awarded a scholarship for prosective medical students. I'm being considered for poet laureate of Houston....and just to be nominated is an honor, in and of itself. My readers group, consisting of 99 % middle-aged white and Jewish women, love me. So all that talk about me being a racist is wishful thinking on your part. I don't fit your stereotype, and your speculation doesn't fit my reality. So there you go. \n \n You actually think that you can write fiction here about a life and relationships you wish you had and we will accept or believe them as anything more than fantasy.

Why? Because you said so? Because it's the truth? Or because you're white, which makes you automatically right?\n \n Uh, you don't know about me? Ask around.
