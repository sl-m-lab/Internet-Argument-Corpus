   "No surprises here.\n \n This article is a great example of one of the many awful effects the media has on the gay rights movement (others include promoting stereotypes). This one involves the wording of the opponents of this amendment:\n \n \"Critics argued the amendment could have unexpected consequences, such as potentially preventing companies from offering health benefits to employees' partners -- gay or heterosexual.\"\n \n If someone asked me why I opposed the amendment, can you actually imagine me saying, \"Well, I oppose it because it could have unexpected consequences.\" Of course not! I oppose the amendment because it denies equal rights and benefits to a group of people who deserve nothing less. I oppose the amendment because it is evil. The media has never once mentioned a half decent argument in support of gay rights. This article does nothing but promote the idea that supporters of gay rights actually agree with banning same-sex marriage but they oppose the amendment because of \"unexpected consequences\". How is anyone supposed to understand the opinion of same-sex marriage supporters with the most timid and weak message in the world being portrayed as the primary line of reasoning held by supporters of same-sex marriage?",

Crowell and comes two months after the mayor appealed a ruling by a New York City judge that denying marriage to gay and lesbian couples violated the state constitution.

Though maybe not all of them have any respect for their opponent's sense of morality, it is probably tough to do that when their opponent's sense of morality says, \"I get more rights than you because my religion says so\". And that is how most see it.\n \n \nNo more so that it infuriates and frustrates us when some of you predict that marriage in this nation will be redefined eventually. It IS the institution of marriage we're trying to protect, after all. Sorry, but it's not a fight to oppress you or deny you civil rights; it's a fight to protect marriage--I don't think you've ever really realized that. I believe the good fight of protecting marriage will win in the end.\n\n \n Maybe what frustrates me is the idea that marriage is somehow \"protected\" if good people are kept away from it, that somehow denying any of the fantastic gay people I know is going to keep marriage safe. How does one protect something from anything that isn't harmful or evil? Same-sex couples are not harmful and they are not evil. They're just people who want the same rights as everyone else, and I can't see how stopping them from having those rights does anything but tear the sanctity of marriage to shreds.",

   "To me it has nothing to do with equal or civil rights.........It is a special right that gays want....They already have the same rights I have when it comes to marriage......They can marry anyone of the opposite sex...\n\n \n Would it be equal if I said that only Muslims get the right to marry or the right to special tax benefits? Certainly you can change your religion to be a Muslim, so you aren't being denied any rights at all. We could take the right to vote away from Christians too. Would everyone still have equal rights in that case?\n \n Realistically, the same rights are not equal rights unless everyone has equal access to them. If give the right to marry to everyone, but we say \"homosexuals can only use this right if they stop being homosexual\" then we are indeed denying rights to homosexuals in the same way that we would be denying rights to Christians or anyone else.

But MrWrite was pointing out that you only see this because people of the majority religion are willing to portray our own religions in the worst possible light themselves, and they are willing to go beyond that and deny us legal rights. If so many of our opponents did not do the same thing and worse, less supporters of gay rights would likely feel justified in portraying their opponents in a horrible light.",

They said if the amendment passes on April 5, it would make the lives of thousands of Kansans more difficult.\n \n \"For me, as a Christian, if I am taking the faith seriously, there's only one way I could vote and that's no,\" said the Rev. Robert Meneilly, a retired Prairie Village pastor who was among those who signed the letter. \"If we are all made by the same God in the same image, we should all have the same rights.\"\n \n Bruce Ney, president of the group Kansans for Fairness, said the letter was put together by clergy members who \"are somewhat taken aback by the idea that every Christian religion in the state of Kansas backs this amendment when, in fact, that is not true. This was their attempt to make that clear and get the word out.\"\n \n In the letter, the ministers say that \"it is not the state government's role to codify one religious interpretation of the Bible, or one religion over another in the Kansas Constitution. To the contrary, the great contribution of our constitution is to protect the rights of all faiths.\"\n",

   "Being Gay? Does anyone here actually think that Gay People just started increasing in numbers recently because the door was opened for them? Does anyone actually believe the percentage of the population that is gay is any different from any other time? Homophobia is a \"normal\" dysfunction (if there is such a thing), and it is understandable to a certain extent. I must say the reasoning of some of those who oppose any form of Gayness period, seems a bit extreme.\n \n Specifically, this Mr. Voice of Reason, he appears to be the loudest, and most vulgar opponet of equal rights for all. His reference to \"Anal Intercourse\" is a example of \"My Morality is SUPERIOR to yours\". I ask this question; if \"some\" people find homosexual sex as disgusting as beastiality, will we have to legislate sodomy laws for Hetrosexual Anal Sex? Perhaps we should outlaw masturbation because it is a form of birth control?\n \n I am not Gay personally . . . I have two nephews who are, and I am honest enough to admit I am still a bit uncomfortable with the affection displayed by 2-men. I am learning to deal with my personality flaw. Since the Amendment Process of changing our Constitution is very challenging, it would appear that no National Amendment would ever have a chance of passing. The door was opened for equal rights for homosexuals long ago, and it is not ever going to close. My suggestion for the people having a difficult time dealing with it, you better get use to it, for it will never go away. Besides, Gay people are People too, perhaps we should remember that.

The term \"silent majority\" is not appropriate.\n \n I have no doubt that majority's desire to oppress the minority did play some factor in Bush's win in Ohio, but statistics suggest that it was a very small part.\n\n \n Just for your information getting a majority of the vote means over 50 percent........\n \n Why was Kerry so sure he was going to win Ohio? It is becasue the silent majority stood up big time...........",

   "Being Gay? Does anyone here actually think that Gay People just started increasing in numbers recently because the door was opened for them? Does anyone actually believe the percentage of the population that is gay is any different from any other time? Homophobia is a \"normal\" dysfunction (if there is such a thing), and it is understandable to a certain extent. I must say the reasoning of some of those who oppose any form of Gayness period, seems a bit extreme.\n \n Specifically, this Mr. Voice of Reason, he appears to be the loudest, and most vulgar opponet of equal rights for all. His reference to \"Anal Intercourse\" is a example of \"My Morality is SUPERIOR to yours\". I ask this question; if \"some\" people find homosexual sex as disgusting as beastiality, will we have to legislate sodomy laws for Hetrosexual Anal Sex? Perhaps we should outlaw masturbation because it is a form of birth control?\n \n I am not Gay personally . . . I have two nephews who are, and I am honest enough to admit I am still a bit uncomfortable with the affection displayed by 2-men. I am learning to deal with my personality flaw. Since the Amendment Process of changing our Constitution is very challenging, it would appear that no National Amendment would ever have a chance of passing. The door was opened for equal rights for homosexuals long ago, and it is not ever going to close. My suggestion for the people having a difficult time dealing with it, you better get use to it, for it will never go away. Besides, Gay people are People too, perhaps we should remember that. People with good hearts, that are great role models, and can contribute more than someone who sprnds their entire being trying to discriminate against them.\n\n \n I personally don't have anything against gays.....What they do in the privacy of their bedrooms is their business...........\n \n I do wish the would practice safe sex.....Maybe AIDS might be eradicated if they would do that........\n \n I just don't think the definition of marriage should be changed for them many reasons I have already stated.......\n \n You liberals don't address my reasons for being againsr gay marriage.....you just resort to your name calling and insults..........\n \n That is the sad part.......",

   "I don't believe I specifically addressed you as the name caller but you know who they are...........The ones that call us homophobes and bigots becasue we don't think the definition of marriage shoukd be changes.........\n\n \n You did not specifically point me out, but you said, \"You liberals\". Because I am one of the liberals who has been responding to you here, I feel that your statement points me out, among others.\n \n \nOne more time just for you.....The reason I am against the definition of marriage changing is because of the problems it would cause ......If that was approved why could not a man marry 2 women or his brother or sister...............\n\n \n Aha, well allow me to explain. First, there is actually a good reason to oppose polygamous and incestual relationships. Starting with incestual relationships, such relationships first have a higher chance at producing children with birth defects. Although I do not feel incestuous couples should be punished for this nature, it is difficult to avoid the fact that some harm does exist by failing to discourage incestuous relationships. It can also be shown that incestuous relationships are generally the result of a form of psychological abuse which results from abuse of the natural bonds of love formed in a family. Again, I do not wish to punish those among whom this is not the case, but again, by failing to discourage incestuous relationships, we are faced with this harm.\n \n Regarding polygamous relationships, well it simply does not make practical sense to allow people to extend their marriage to many individuals. Doing so would allow, for example, one individual to extend his health care benefits across ten different spouses and all of their children. It simply isn't practical to allow that sort of health care coverage. The same could be said with all of the benefits of marriage; one could write off countless people as dependants for tax breaks or food stamps, and one person could naturalize as many people as he wishes. Currently people in polygamous relationships can extend those benefits to one other person, and that is both fair and practical.\n \n That being said, neither of these sorts of relationships will likely become legalized for the simple fact that they are incredibly unpopular, and this isn't likely to change. Beyond that, there are good reasons to deny those forms of marriage, as I stated above, so we'll have good arguments against them should someone try to legalize them.\n \n Finally, the possibility of these things being legalized really has no bearing on the morality of same-sex marriage. Even if it was certain that allowing same-sex marriage would allow these forms of marriage, that would only be a downside of legalizing same-sex marriage, it wouldn't be a reason that same-sex marriage itself is wrong.\n \n \nPeople who were not even gay would be getting married just for the tax benefits...........Income taxes which are already high would have to be raised much higher...........There are a mulitutde of reasons I could expound on but you get the picture..............\n\n \n Remember that people who are not straight currently get married just for the benefits, and people who do not love each other currently get married just for the benefits. The people who are likely to do that would not increase in number simply because same-sex marriage is legalized, they just might not have to look as hard to find someone willing to do it with them. This is compounded by the fact that even people who marry for convenience would not want to be branded as gay, and would therefore be unlikely to engage in such a marriage. There is no reason to believe that legalizing same-sex marriage would suddenly make an additional number of people believe that it is acceptable to marry just for the benefits, it would only make it slightly easier for people who would already do that to do so. Beyond that, the same negative effect you describe, if it can even be called a negative effect, is present in opposite-sex marriage to an even greater degree. Because of this, there is no reason to believe that there would be any detrimental effect on marriage itself.\n \n Regarding increased taxes, I will link to a government study finding that legalizing same-sex marriage will improve the federal budget, reducing taxes, not the other way around:\n \n http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=5559&sequence=0\n \n This study also fails to factor in reduced adoption costs related to increased adoption rates of same-sex couples.\n \n Yet even if same-sex marriage did increase taxes, it would do so only in a fair manner. It can only be understood today that opposite-sex couples force same-sex couples to pay for their marriages through tax money. When same-sex couples ask opposite-sex couples to fund their marriages in return, opposite-sex couples have refused. Heterosexuals are forcing homosexuals to pay for their marriages while recieving nothing in return. This increase in taxes, if it were an increase in taxes, would only make each taxpayer pay for his own marriage. It would fix heterosexuals taking money from homosexuals.\n \n I have addressed your reasons. Feel free to debate them or bring up some new points, but please give them fair consideration.",

   "Your to sensitive my friend...........Read my lips........I mentioned no names...\n\n \n Again, I would like to remind you that we are having a so-called debate over the internet. Therefore, it is quite impossible for me to \"Read\" your \"lips\". It cannot be done.\n \n When I was a child, I could say things like, \"those Miller's are all Dope Peddlers\". Even though it was just John who was selling Pot. I seriously hope you can maturely understand the preceding example. \n \n If you would like to actually address any of the words in my post that led to your subliminal and non confrontational response, I am here to entertain anything you wish to counter with. When I write \"counter\", I mean actually addressing the subject at hand. My internal senses tell me that if  you were actually involved in any kind of debate on a personal  level, you would probablly not have much to say, or be embarrassed enough to leave the room. Unless of course you had a few neocon talking points waiting in reserve (which would probably have noting to do with the subject). Now, if I am wrong, forgive me, I am new.\n \n Also, I assure, I have no sensitivity as it concerns debate, you know what I mean, real debate.",

You have not done so.\n \n \nPeople who were not even gay would be getting married just for the tax benefits...........\n\n Are you saying this doens not happen now?\n \n \nIncome taxes which are already high would have to be raised much higher...........There are a mulitutde of reasons I could expound on but you get the picture..............\n\n \n A congressional study found that same-sex marriage would INCREASE federal revenues by aprox. $1 BILLION per year over a each of the next 5 years.",

   "Its and expression my friend............ lighten up :)\n\n \n I am just curious, is this a coded message meant to inform me that you will not discuss any one issue or question I have asked of you? If we were actually having a discussion in person, you would not be able to avoid every issue, for your words would pin you down, and you would either have to explain yourself or admit that you have no clue.\n \n Political Forums? The last refuge for MacCarthy type zealots who believe confrontation, division, and emotions are the keys to getting what they want? I do know this, having a debate opponent who never addresses an issue is quite frustrating to say the least. Shall my experiment with Political Forums turn into an exercise in futility?",
