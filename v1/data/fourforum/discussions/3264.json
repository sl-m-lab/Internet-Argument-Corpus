   "This month's Wired Magazine:\n The Crusade Against Evolution\n =======================\n Not surprised while reading this, very pretient to this forum.\n \n To summarize:\n \"Teach the Controversy\"\n (most paraphrased from oct. 2004 wired)\n \n This is what many of us will recognize having spent even just a little time in this forum. Certain people who post here, of course, immediately spring to mind.\n \n Creationists, that is, religious fundamentalists, have bred a new strategy to spread the word of gawd. In a nutshell, they do this:\n \n 1. Don't mention the bible in debates about evolution or intelligent design.\n 2. Use scientific words, pseudo-science, and most of all, don't get into factual debates, just use rhetoric and cast doubt on the issue.\n 3. You want to show that \" a complex issue can be seen from two entirely rational yet opposing views\". The word \"rational\" of course being the lie.\n 4. They don't need anyone in the scientific community to agree, in fact, they have never, and still haven't, made any progress in terms of having creation/intelligent design even remotely accepted by scientists. They just need to sway \"public\" opinon.\n 5. Education in our country, and politics, are determined in a democractic way, not by a bunch of experts. So, swaying public opinion with phoney science seems to work fine.\n \n Another interesting distinction is that one promoter of this movement, the Discovery Institute, was founded by a conservative think-tank...basically an organized group of educated, yet profoundly evangelical people with an agenda to spread their faith (christianity in this case, in case the thousands of religions of the world might have confused you on who was behind this one) \n They simply don't care if it's accepted in the scientific arena. That's not the goal. The goal is to spread doubt, have it \"appear\" a contested issue (evolution vs creationism), to hook people away from godless evolution to their faith-based belief system. Give those people a \"way out\" of listening to scientific materialism. Show them that it's OK to disagree with rational science, and to believe in a supernatural almighty apathetic creator.\n \n Science on the other hand spawned from philosophy, and it's goal is \"understanding\", and seems to have stumbled upon evolution, not set out to prove it. Always interesting to draw those comparisons.\n \n And of course, this approach has had little to no impact on science. It continues to work hard to add to the knowledge of the entire human race, while some people seem content to try and tear it down in favor of irrational, self-rightous madness.\n \n It struck me as funny to be reading it in Wired today, after just exlaiming about certain people on this forum, and those exact bullet items all seemed to fit in so nicely. While I may never truly know each person's motivations, this article seems to back what I've witnessed first hand...and it's scary stuff. It seems getting people to think rationally is hard when we only live for 75ish years...we have to keep....teaching...sanity.\n \n I know a few people on this forum that \"Teach the Controversy\", do you?\n \n -Mach",

   "Teach the controversy is a good term for describing what the Young Earth Creationist movement (in particular) seems to have adopted over the last 20 or so years as a response to their percieved assault on the Christian ideal by the findings in certain areas of scientific study.\n \n I suppose groups such as Answers in Genesis and the Instiute for Creation Research could be seen as organisations whose sole purpose is to disseminate and forward the \"teach the controversy\" agenda. Men such as Tim LaHaye (best known for his co-authorship of the Left Behind series of books) and Ken Ham are key figures in driving these organisations on.\n \n I find the whole issue insidious to say the least. Thats a pretty strong word to use but I think it is more than justified in this instance.\n \n The mimicry of scientific writing style is particularly unpleasant. It misleads impressionable readers into thinking they are reading something that is actually science and without bias. Just about every effort is made to cast doubt on the outlook of mainstream science and supplant it with a reassuring creation based alternative. To an audience that is not well read in the science of, say, evolution I fear it is quite often very compelling, and takes advantage of their predisposition not to question that which comes from knowledgable \"good Christian\" teachers. Exposure to such material will basically neuter in many people the desire to find out more and deny them the chance to make up their own opinions on the matter from thier own readings. It makes science appear stupid, dishonest and deceitful and can colour peoples opinion to automatically treat such science as conspiritorial and untrustworthy.\n \n It is no small wonder these people are constantly attempting to infiltrate their material in the school cirriculum- they know it is best to start on those that are at their most impressionable.\n \n I also see another perversion of the use of language by those who \"teach the controversy\". They claim themselves to be evangelical, yet they are forwarding an agenda that is based on material not found within the Christian Gospels. Perhaps we should call them Genesists as that seems to be the only content that matters to them in the Christian message.\n \n \n I agree with you Mach- it is scary stuff. I don't even live in the USA where \"teach the controversy\" is at its strongest. However, I am seriously concerned by its creeping infiltration- no sooner is one door of opportunity shut to these groups than others routes are sought.\n \n Interesting to hear what else other people have to say on this one.",

   "At a time when the United States smugly considered itself to be the world leader in science, the USSR launched Sputnik I (October 4, 1957), and then just about a month later (November 3, 1957), Sputnik II. The U.S. was shocked. Programs were started to \"catch up with the Russians.\" NASA itself was one of these programs. Still, the USSR also put it's first man into orbit (April 12, 1961) before the first American flew in a suborbital flight (May 5, 1961).\n \n Progress was slow and it took a while to catch up. One program in the schools was to revamp the science curriculum in our schools. Instead of science as a list of facts, the new programs concentrated more on learning the process of science, how it worked, and the logical conclusions that are the theories of science. Curriculums with new texts were developed in all of the sciences. I became familiar with the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS). After a more or less traditional biology education, as a young teacher I used the text books from this program. Fortunately, I also had a good background in cell physiology, genetics and evolution.\n \n As a result of the renewal of science teaching, a backlash to certain scientific concepts arose. This backlash grew from a small group of 7th Day Adventists. When science didn't cover material about the age and origin of the universe, or the age of the earth, there was no objection from religious leaders. But when current science was finally being taught, some saw it as being in conflict with their religion. The worst scientific concept of all from the standpoint of the religious fundamentalists was that of the common descent of all life from a common ancestor.\n \n Nevertheless, we did a better job of teaching science for a time. Court challenges to the teaching of science by religious fundamentalists were defeated again and again. The courts struck down statutes that outlawed the teaching of evolution and an old earth and universe. The courts struck down laws that required the teaching of \"creation science\" along side real biology. Creation science was judged not to be science while evolutionary biology was found to represent the most current biological information.\n \n But we are again not doing such a good job in the teaching of science. The U.S. actually ranks near the bottom in tests given to 12th grade students that measure competence in math and science. When our President can reveal his own ignorance by stating that \"the jury is still out\" on evolution, it does not bode well for the future of the U.S. as a leader. The decline has started. High tech jobs are moving out of this country. Soon we will be a second rate country following the lead of India, China and Japan.\n \n But creationism isn't the cause but just one of the symptoms. We don't do a good enough job in teaching science that children are able to recognize creationism for the foolishness that it is. Our children have so little understanding of science that they are unable to recognize the religious claptrap of men like Ken Ham, Kent Hovind, Carl Baugh and Henry Morris for the ignorance that it is.",

(Note: with regards 'The Cross' you were unhappy to be labelled anti-Christian when you debated against one particular thing - the Cross - you should know how I feel :) )\n \n But the nationalist science theory of the poster I addressed struck my interest because he tied it in to a specific series of events; the space race. Even more specifically, the fact that the Soviets beat you. (Note: They also beat you in putting a woman into space, and also in having a 'space-walk') And it seems that the blame for this is twofold\n a) the poor teaching of science\n and\n b) religious people\n \n I would like to know - when you talk of 'advantage' what do you mean.

Maybe you're speaking from an expert position on this subject matter? I, ahem, think not, as always, you are using poor exaggeration in your post. Maybe you are just one of many \"teaching the controversy\".\n \n It's ironic, a creationist's fear of the knowledge that they evolved from lesser life-forms leaves them acting irrationally...as animals do. While those who choose the path of rational thinking admit their animal nature, and strive for reason, the opposite of their animal nature. \n \n \n You aren't attacking science, you are attacking rational thought, you're attacking the human race. What our ancestors have died in passing on to us, the entire foundation of our learned knowledge and society, that we continue to build upon. You disgrace the human race with irrational thinking. Rational thought is what seperates us from uncivilized chaos. You didn't get your computer, air conditioning, your home, a longer life-span, your civilized society, and your modern medicine from some non-existent god, you got it from other humans. Most of whom are dead, but who did a little something constructive with their obscenely short lives. Do them all a favor and respect their contribution to your life, don't dedicate yourself to tearing it down with irrationality as you sit in a climate controlled environment on a computer built from a semiconductor implanted with various elements, and live in a country with laws and a society that has come to be through the hard work of humans, a few of whom had the bright idea to better their existence, and the existence of those around them. They didn't do this with the intervention of gods and goddesses, they did it through their mental and physical efforts.\n \n Science? Evolution? They don't care if you attack them, you come with the wrong weapons. Faith and fantasy have little effect on reason. They aren't supported by some obscure scientific establishment, they are supported by reason. What science tries to describe will exist with or without the human race. Faith and fantasy, on the other hand, our products of the human mind.\n \n (disclaimer for other sentient life forms of course.)\n \n -Mach",

If you want to debate - for example on the 'noun' debate, you've had plenty of opportunity to do so.\n It is interesting you have the same qualifications that Ungerdunn/Accipitridae stated he had, as well, you use the exact same 'factless' argument - with regards refutations made somewhere else, some other time. As well, you make the same claims with regards to English, and the same defence - that it is not an insult - based on an 'observation' that itself rests on this hollow claim that somewhere else I have been refuted.\n One might expect to learn by their mistakes. But when you make such an insult, and I state it is insulting, and warn you, then you're warned by others, then you continue, then you're banned, and then you re-enter under another name, to do the same again, only for this to follow through to another banning, only for you to do it again here, obviously you're committed to a particular debating style and can't help modify your behaviour.

It merely claims that since there is inadequate (none) evidence, it's not rational to believe in it. Hence, a-theist.\n\n The term agnostic was coined by T.H. Huxley. There is a subtle difference in the meaning of the two terms, agnostic and athiest. As you point out, an atheist is one who is without a belief in a god. Even at that, there are strong and weak atheists. A strong atheist denies a belief in god, whild a weak atheist doesn't believe because there is not evidence.\n \n On the other hand, an agnostic doesn't consider the question, holding the view that it is unanswerable. The existance of god is unknowable and therefore not worthy of consideration. The distinction between a weak atheist and an agnostic may be a bit semantic, but they know who they are.\n \n#2 Teaching controversy where one does not exist, especially on such a topic as this, is not productive, and misleading at best. And besides, if you teach religion in school, you violate the seperation of church and state, plain and simple. Teaching a religion-based viewpoint in a public school in an effort to \"contrast\" it with science, is simply teaching religion. Let this debate occur in college, or later in life, not on the tax-payer dime. Religious institutions already get tax breaks, why give them even more welfare?\n\n Certainly true. More than 99% of degreed biologists and geologists are evolutionists. Of natural/physical scientists in general, more than 95% are creationists. Many of the leading \"creation scientists\" don't even have legitimate science degrees (Hovind, Baugh, Patton). One of the favorite claims of creationists is that the number of scientists who believe in creation is growing, and they offer lists. Of course, their lists include historical scientists from the times when modern science was just being developed. They include Newton (an arian), Copernicus, Galileo, Maxwel, and on and on. Few actually lived after the publication of \"Origin\". But they offer a list of 150 or so \"scientists,\" few of whom are biologists or geologists, as evidence.\n \n So about 1% of the population is named Steve in some form. The NCSE has compiled a list of scientists named Steve who accept the theory of evolution. All of them have subscribed to the following statement:\n \nEvolution is a vital, well-supported, unifying principle of the biological sciences, and the scientific evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the idea that all living things share a common ancestry. Although there are legitimate debates about the patterns and processes of evolution, there is no serious scientific doubt that evolution occurred or that natural selection is a major mechanism in its occurrence. It is scientifically inappropriate and pedagogically irresponsible for creationist pseudoscience, including but not limited to \"intelligent design,\" to be introduced into the science curricula of our nation's public schools.\n\n There are currently 450 Steves on the list, many more than the lists proffered by creationists. When you include the other 99% of scientists not named steve, there is no controversy about evolution.\n \n The Project Steve site of the NCSE is HERE\n The list honors Dr. Steven Jay Gould, Harvard Professor of biology, geology, and paleontology, prolific author, theorist, and educator of evolutionary science.\n \n As for the \"separation of church and state,\" creationists will point out that those words aren't in the Constitution. Of course, the actual words were from Thomas Jefferson in his description of the intent of the 2nd Amendment in a letter to the Danbury Baptists. He said that the 2nd Amendment offered a \"...wall of separation between church and state.\" Jefferson was reassuring them that the federal government would not make laws supressing their particular brand of Christianity. They were a persecuted minority in the late 1700s and early 1800s. Isn't it a perverse bit of irony that it is now the Baptists who lead the fight to strike down both the establishment clause and the free exercise clause in an effort to impose their religion on everyone?",

I am not so obsessed that I feel the need to track down old posts in which your claims were laid bare, what good would it do?\n\n That's hysterical. It's 'cause you for the most part, you can't. You simply refer to 'somewhere else' as if such deluded statements convince people.\n \nAs for Berlinski:\n \n http://www.discovery.org/scripts/vi...sponses&id=1406\n let the spinning commence! \n\n \nYou had a point in citing this site? Was it the whole site you objected to, or particular bits? I for one would like to speak up for Mach here, who might be disinclined to read this very long site. \n\n \nI didn't object to anything,\n\n Not true. I cited your claims re: Berlinksi.\n \nand if you would take your lithium like you are supposed to, your mind may have slowed enough to understand the point.\n\n What point?\n \nAfter I mentioned Berlinski's take on ID, after you had been mentioning him and someone asked who he was, you wrote:\n\n \n\"Ah, what a critical eye you have. Note all the references SLP gave. Don't be fooled by unsourced anti-debate rhetoric.\"\n\n \nSo, I provided a url that showed that Berlinksi doesn't think much about ID, either. Pretty obvious, when one's mind is not racing, searching for something - anything - to use to distract and distort.\n\n That's not true. Your claim was that Berlinksi didn't believe in evolution. You said so Post 13\n Mach replied 'if this were true...then... blah blah blah'\n And I said, don't be fooled because you posted no cites to back your claim\n You responded Post 16 with the citation above. You even linked it to the bit about Berlinski. You said \"As for Berlinksi....\" and then gave the citation. And does it back your claim? Nope. They are the times you mention Berlinski on this thread.\n That's the hilarity of your whole style of argument. You make generalised statements tantamount to speculation and ad hominem. When pinned down for any actual evidence you give a site which, if you haven't read it, it makes one wonder why cite it, and if you actually did read it, you seem to miss that it doesn't support your claim; so why cite it?\n \nYour claim in post 13 was\n\n \nBerlinski is an egomaniacal conservative mathematician. \n\n \nSpeculation? Proven where? What's a 'conservative' mathematician, does he vote Republican?\n\n \nI am sure he does. His associations (the Discovery Institute, writing in 'Commentary' magazine, etc.) indicate his affiliations.\n No speculation required.\n\n Really? So being apart of Discovery, if that's what he does, means he's an egomaniac. Mmmm... I see your point. Not!\n \nHe blabbers on about how evolution is impossible. \n\n \nI'll take a guess, but please let me know if you had another bit in mind...\n \" I pointed this out in my book, Icons of Evolution (2000), and Mr. Berlinski agrees, writing that Darwinism is little more than a ?fantastic extrapolation? in which the mechanism responsible for some minor changes within species ?is read into the global record of life itself.? (Ibid).\n This is not to say that 'evolution is impossible' BUT 'Darwinian evolution is impossible'. \n\n \nAmazing distinction. \"An act of intelligence is required to bring even a thimble into being,why should the artefacts of life be different?\" says Berlinski.\n One should wonder why you get so hung up on tangential minutiae like you do. Most likely to distract from the issues.\n\n But you're the one who made the categorical statement... Berlinski doesn't believe in evolution. This is just not supported by any evidence that you present.\n \nHe also, however, recently wrote that ID is not science. \n\n \nRecently? In the same post, or another?\n\n \nSame thing. The spirit of his beliefs are obvious.\n\n Oh, it proves itself. Right!\n \nI don't imagine that we will be hearing much from the ID crowd about that... \n\n \nSpeculation.\n\n \nWow - yes, yes it IS speculation! My, your powers of perception are impeccable! This is just incredible! Monty the magnificent can tell when someone is speculating even if they did not come right out and say so! Is that not incredible!!???? We'd better contact the Randi Foundation for Monty's million bucks is waiting for him!\n\n Speculation based on what? Even wading through the sarcasm, all you've done is provided a statement and basically said 'it is'. What is the value of such speculation? Nil.\n \nIf I were marking this 'treatment' of yours I would give it a poor grade based mainly on the failure to link any of your statements with an actual piece of evidence... \n\n \nThis is an internet discussionboard, XXXXX. Unlike obsessive zealots, normal people do not feel the need to make every post a publication-ready opus (not that anything you have written would come close). Ad hominem? You bet. That is about all I can see Monty the great warranting.\n\n Do you think name-calling helps? But as for having evidence, you provide a cite, and I can cast a critical eye over it, and it doesn't prove your point - if you had one. Now you get all defensive and claim that you don't need any facts to back up your speculation, ad hominem etc. I suppose you believe a 'discussion' board is one in which you give a rant, and a few insults, and I reply in kind.\n \nother than your citation which is in effect to say 'it's all there somewhere - you do the research'. This does not include the speculation at the end which, because the rest of your treatment is evidence-lite, must itself lack any rational.\n\n \nAny rational what?\n\n I left off an 'e'.\n \nWhere are your cites? What, I have to read it all myself and see where there is no rational something? No rational something, oh dear! maybe I should search through old posts and dig up some of Monty's gaffe's to divert the issues, oh my, what shall I do?\n\n I don't need to cite to look at your cite. That's a silly argument. You volunteered providing information.\n \nBy the way, Monty - I noticed that you have yet to grace my 'Teach the Controversey' thread.\n I wonder why? \n\n \nIf you're asking, I've not even read it.\n\n \nOf course not.\n\n Ah dear sweet nonsense. Is this what you call 'discussion'? I'm amazed anyway that you exhibited such control and only got off a few insults.",

   "#1 Agnostic is a fairly useless term in my opinion, and I think it weakens the position. If you don't believe in any specific religion's claims of a supreme being or creator, then you're atheist. You're NOT A THEIST. I don't care if you understand the limitations of knowledge and cannot claim to know it \"doesn't exist.\" It's the same thing. You do not believe in it. It's not rational to believe in it. Atheism does not require one to claim omniscience about the existence of anything. It merely claims that since there is inadequate (none) evidence, it's not rational to believe in it. Hence, a-theist.\n\n actually, there is a distinct difference between agnostics and atheists. athiests actively believe that God doesnt exist. agnostics entertain that God could possibly exist or not, but believes a conclusion cannot be made with the knowledge available.\n \n \n#2 Teaching controversy where one does not exist, especially on such a topic as this, is not productive, and misleading at best. And besides, if you teach religion in school, you violate the seperation of church and state, plain and simple. Teaching a religion-based viewpoint in a public school in an effort to \"contrast\" it with science, is simply teaching religion. Let this debate occur in college, or later in life, not on the tax-payer dime. Religious institutions already get tax breaks, why give them even more welfare?\n\n the idea is not teaching religion in schools. teaching the controversy is essentially planting seeds of doubt into the audience's minds. by giving them grounds to reconsider the validity of the evolution theory, you force them to think objectively about whether its true or not. of course, for those who are already convinced about evolution or creation already, like mach said, there is no controversy. \n \n it will be interesting to find out just exactly what \"controversal information\" about evolution will be presented. no doubt evolutionists will be working towards debunking them as soon as they pop up",

I went through his attack on Berlinski with some precision; going over what he actually said, and the source he quoted. That he was found lacking and has now gone is not an insult. That's why you can make generalsied and factless points such as this and try and pass them off as debate. As stated, I went through SLP's arguments.

   "The term itself is modern, but is derived from Greek; gnosis (knowledge) with 'a' put in front (which in Greek means 'without' as in amoral is without morals, and is different from immoral).

Just that we can never know. That's a difference from denial. However, I have, in an effort to refute you, searched through many dictionaries, and see that it can be used in the context you use, BUT also in the context I use.\n Hence...\n \"Agnosticism\n A philosophical theory of the limitations of knowledge, professing doubt of or disbelief in some or all of the powers of knowing possessed by the human mind. \n I. EXPOSITION\n (2) Agnosticism, as a general term in philosophy, is frequently employed to express any conscious attitude of doubt, denial, or disbelief, towards some, or even all, of man's powers of knowing or objects of knowledge. The meaning of the term may accordingly vary, like that of the other word \"Scepticism\", which it has largely replaced, from partial to complete Agnosticism; it may be our knowledge of the world, of the self, or of God, that is questioned; or it may be the knowableness of all three, and the validity of any knowledge, whether of sense or intellect, science or philosophy, history, ethics, religion. The variable element in the term is the group of objects, or propositions, to which it refers; the invariable element, the attitude of learned ignorance it always implies towards the possibility of acquiring knowledge.\"\n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01215c.htm\n and\n Agnosticism\n Agnosticism is the position of believing that knowledge of the existence or non-existence of God is impossible. It is often put forth as a middle ground between theism and atheism. Understood this way, agnosticism is skepticism regarding all things theological. The agnostic holds that human knowledge is limited to the natural world, that the mind is incapable of knowledge of the supernatural. Understood this way, an agnostic could also be a theist or an atheist. The former is called a fideist, one who believes in God purely on faith. The latter is sometimes accused by theists of having faith in the non-existence of God, but the accusation is absurd and the expression meaningless. The agnostic atheist simply finds no compelling reason to believe in God\n http://skepdic.com/agnosticism.html\n However, \n \" In its original implication, corresponding to the position of its inventor, the term agnostic represented a state of suspended judgment with regard both to theism and atheism. On the ground that existing evidence does not justify either the affirmation or the denial of the being of God, God is held to be unknown.\"\n http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=901&letter=A&search=agnosticism\n As coined by Huxley, it didn't mean an denial of God! And this site gives a more fuller explanation...(in part reads...)\n \"Atheism and Agnosticism\n The main purpose of this article is to explore the differences between atheism and agnosticism, and the relations between them. The task is made more difficult because each of these words are what Wittgenstein called ?family resemblance? words. That is, we cannot expect to find a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for their use. Their use is appropriate if a fair number of the conditions are satisfied. Moreover even particular members of the families are often imprecise, and sometimes almost completely obscure. Sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself, even passionately, as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalised philosophical scepticism which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic.\n http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/stanford/entries/atheism-agnosticism/\n Thus in common usage people misuse the word. The proper use of the words are in different contexts. One is denial of God. The other is doubt that God exists, or a belief that we can never know God. That is not to deny that God exists - just to say 'we'll never know'.\n Thus...\n Agnosticism\n Belief that human beings do not have sufficient evidence to warrant either the affirmation or the denial of a proposition. The term is used especially in reference to our lack of knowledge of the existence of god. In this, the agnostic, who holds that we cannot know whether or not god exists, differs from the atheist, who denies that god exists. \n Recommended Reading: Clarence Darrow, Why I Am an Agnostic and Other Essays (Prometheus, 1994) {at Amazon.com} and Bertrand Russell, Why I Am Not a Christian, and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects (Simon & Schuster, 1977)\n http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/a2.htm#agno\n \n Other references:\n http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/ath/blag_what.htm",

You know which uni I went to?\n \nOkay if you admit some of it is true, then which bits of evidence are true? \n\n \nA case in point of your constant \"so have you stopped beating your wife yet\" questions.\n\n You'll have to explain what this means.\n \nSome of it may be true. We have no way of knowing which though if that were the case. I do not admit some is true. I do not admit all of it is untrue.\n\n There's that Nuremburg problem again! You dismiss all the evidence.\n \nThen that is false; see example re: magistrates above. For you you are trying to argue 'conflict=truth unknowable', but you don't have this view in regards science, I bet. \n\n \nWhat are you gibbering on about here?\n\n You have no problem with 'scientific truth' even when they must wade through evidences, and even when the same pieces of evidence can be used for mutually exclusive theories. So your dismissal of a whole lot of one evidences seems odd.\n \nYou tell me. You're the one who is either arguing that there is some, or there isn't.\n If there is some, how would YOU tell?\n What is the logic of throwing it all out, if there might possible be some? \n\n \nBecause we have no way of knowing whether any of the evidence that religions offer is valid or not. It is unreliable evidence.\n\n Then you state it is ALL unreliable because some of it is (probably) false.\n \nWhy do you feel it illogical to throw out unreliable evidence?\n\n Why do you feel it illogical to taint all the evidence?\n \nIt would be preferable if you avoided that type of language. \n\n \nAnd I would prefer it if you ceased misrepresenting everything I write.\n\n So, you now say you have the right to use questionable language based on an unsupported generalisation.\n \nBut I bet you're totally unconcerned, never-the-less at conflicts in science. \n\n \nThen you lose your bet. Conflicts in science are a good thing: they encourage further testing and improve the reliablity (sic) of our knowledge. I am very concerned about conflicts in science, for if they ceased, then science would start to descend to the faith-based depths of religions.\n\n Why isn't it all unreliable because some of it is? Why isn't this the case for science evidence?\n \nThe mistake is that you made an assumption that I was confused... I expect you applied set-theory to this \n\n \nI proved you were either confused, or just made a little mistake that you can't admit to, with sets, yes. You might like to answer my simple little question on that matter one day BTW.\n\n You questioned me as to the connection. I stated from the beginning it was to do with primates. You didn't accept it, because it got in the way of your theory, which you now state is proved. What fun. Still I suppose that could justify you for being rude here too, if you wanted; another unsupported theory.\n \nWhat about 'God is'? Wouldn't God, by definition be hard to define? \n\n \nIf one cannot define a thing, then how can one carry out repeatable tests to assertain (sic) it's existence and thus derive evidence for its existence?\n\n Really, so repeating a test guarantees it's accurate?\n So applying a type of testing that wouldn't be able to test for God anyway, is reliable?\n \nWhy does this mean God does not exist? \n\n \nIt doesn't: its evidence to suggest it doesn't exist. If we cannot define something, then it suggests that thing doesn't exist.\n\n I gave a definition of God, the one He gives of Himself. He says \"I am\". You just don't like the definition, based on the fact if can't be tested by your idea of testing; and therefore because your idea of testing determines truth, you can't determine if God is true.\n \n The world could be full of invisible spirit unicorns; there could be a god. \n\n What's an invisible spirit unicorn and how does it differ from the 'normal' unicorn?\n \n Why does this mean God does not exist? Humanity can't decide yet if they can test if there are aliens. I doubt you categorically deny aliens exist; as you do of God. \n \n \nOh dear, I see we are getting nowhere with you yet again Monty. Tell me Monty, which bit of my statement \"We cannot know that there definately [isn't] a god\" (spelling corrected) has lead you to conclude that I categorically deny god exists?\n\n I hope I get this summation right...\n What you mean is you'll establish as reliable a system called science, that even though it committs erros that you're happy about, and spits out mutually exclusive theories based on the same 'objective' evidence; and although this science can't, by it's very construction test for God in the first place, you'll use it as the only yardstick for whether God exists or not; and based on the fact that it can't test for God anyway, you'll not accept any other searches for God. And although this doesn't mean God doesn't exist, we can't prove God does, because of the very nature of the system we're using. And any other searches for truth that also comes up with conflicting results are unreliable, because it comes up with different results, even though the more 'accurate' version 'science' does as well! What a hoot.\n In effect you're constructing an argument that science is more reliable, because it's more reliable.",

   "[quote=Montalban]It is a lot of people claiming lots of different instances of different crimes by lots of people, with those people providing evidence to differing degrees of guilt, complicity, or total innocence. This is why it's such a good analogy. \n \nHow many WWII holocausts have there been in the last 1,000 years Monty?\n\n I'm dealing with the Nuremberg trials, not 'the holocaust'. They are not wholly synonymous. The trials involved all crimes against humanity, including atrocities against non-Jewish civilian populations, and allied PoWs. The scope of it was immense. You could argue not as 'immense' as with differing religions (excepting that of the great religions there's a lot of commonality; such as a belief in the super-natural; for all its complexity, for example, Hinduism ultimately believes in one god, too!). The scope of setting of the trials included sifting through partial records and evidences (some destroyed by the Nazis, some accidentally, by the allies), and conflicts of testimony. Many of the key criminals had months of time to prepare their statements, collaborate them, and thus present false alibis and misleading information.\n \nOh it's one isn't it. It isn't a valid analogy as it is a bunch of trials related to one event: the holocaust.\n\n You seem to mistake the Nuremberg trial; my analogy, with a part of it. As if you were to deal with Hugh Trevor-Roper's investigation into the death of Hitler; to ascertain if he really had died, and use one small incident in the allied campaign to bring justice to bear, as 'it'. (He had to work through vastly diminishing evidence, contradictory witnesses - who had a motive for protecting their leader, and was able to come up with the report that Hitler was dead; Nuremberg was much much more vast).\n Not only were there judges from four separate victorious nations, but each nation had their own legal teams, which didn't always act to pool their resources, further complicating issues.\n Consult Tusa, A, & Tusa, J, (1983) \"The Nuremberg Trial\"\n But, to put it simply, you'd throw it all away.\n \nReally? You know which uni I went to? \n\n \nNo. I don't much care either.\n\n Oh, be nice!\n \nYou'll have to explain what this means.\n\n \nIt is called a \"loaded question\".

You dismiss all the evidence. \n\n \nNope, just the unreliable evidence.\n\n No, you dismiss it all. You won't even test which bits are true, because some of it is false. Therefore you discard it all. I thought you'd want to pursue the truth, but obviously 'too hard', is the stamp you apply.\n \nYou have no problem with 'scientific truth' even when they must wade through evidences, and even when the same pieces of evidence can be used for mutually exclusive theories. So your dismissal of a whole lot of one evidences seems odd. \n\n \nIt seems odd to you, true. That is because you cannot grasp the difference between objective evidence and subjective evidence.\n\n Can you give me an example of objective evidence; something never subjected to man's subjective mind.\n \nThen you state it is ALL unreliable because some of it is (probably) false. \n\n \nKindly quote where I claim that.\n\n Are you now saying that it is reliable? In that case why not use it?\n \nWhy do you feel it illogical to taint all the evidence? \n\n \nOops, another instance of \"have you stopped beating your wife yet?\" from Monty.\n\n You do have a tendency for colourful, and violent metaphor.\n \nSo, you now say you have the right to use questionable language based on an unsupported generalisation. \n\n \nDo I? Kindly quote where I say that.\n\n I'd be more than happy for you to say that we can use this evidence.

You are unwilling to say as you have claimed they are and aren't on two separate occasions.\n\n I don't need to clarify anything. I gave you an answer. You didn't accept that. Rather than mere asking for clarification you announced your theory as if it's fact... there-by expressing whether its possible to discuss that topic then, in a reasonable tone.\n \n Really, so repeating a test guarantees it's accurate? \n \n \nNo. It increases the probability that it is accurate.\n\n How do you know?\n \nSo applying a type of testing that wouldn't be able to test for God anyway, is reliable? \n\n \nWhy wouldn't one be able to test for a god. If it exists and influences the physical world, then its affects upon that physical world are measurable.\n\n Cool. What's a good test we can use?\n \nI gave a definition of God, the one He gives of Himself. He says \"I am\". \n\n \nThat's just a meaningless statement of your opinion of what a god is.\n\n It might be meaningless to you. It's not to myself, and quite a number of Christians. Which itself doesn't prove it's right, but suggests that you're out of step with understanding a concept that even Sunday School children learn.\n \nSomeone else might say the definition is \"we are\" because they believe there are many gods. So straight away we have failed to define anything as there isn't even agreement on how many there are. \n\n So? God doesn't use that definition.
