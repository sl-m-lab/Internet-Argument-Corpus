   "This may be my only post on this thread as my discussions with OC generally get skewed by his false logic and digressions from the main topic.\n\n \n Aside from your constant failure to actually prove anything you say or disprove a single argument I made.\n \n \nFirstly, Hillary is not honest. She is trying to get elected...nothing more.\n\n \n Then we can call anyone we want a Marxist because they are dishonest. You're a Marxist! emoticon_xagree \n \n \nAfter she gets elected, the real Hillary will stand up. Recall, if you can, that a lot of people liked Hitler before he turned really bad.\n\n \n And you know this how? What makes you think that you know the real Hillary?\n \n Your argument is nothing more then idle speculation. And a number of leaders have done what they said they would do and not changed from the previous leadership behavior. \n \n I still notice you don't want to discuss how Hillary supported Bill's push to lower supervision on Tyson Foods which lead to serious spikes in food poisoning and recalls by them. That has largely been kept quiet. It would seem that those kinds of actions are the Real Hillary rather then your idle speculation.\n \n You more or less are now pretending I never said that. Why is it that? Because it makes holes in your argument? \n \n \nSecondly, one does not have to agree with every plank of a particular party to be considered one of them.\n\n \n True, but one does have to follow the basic ideology, especially the unifying theme. You wouldn't call someone who followed some of Jesus's teachings but didn't believe in Jesus to be a Christian, likewise you wouldn't call someone who believes in Capitalism and the Class Structure to be a Marxist or a Communist. You wouldn't call someone a believer in Democracy if they didn't think people should be allowed to vote even if they believed in a free press, civil rights and the works. There are some key criteria that must be met before one can be labeled anything. If we are, as you are, to ignore this, we can define anything however we want and thus label anyone anything we so choose. The English Language for all purposes becomes useless and everything boils into arguments about semantics. But that may be the only way you can win a argument....\n \n You have no actual proof that she now believes in Marxism and the only thing that actually points that way is a paper she wrote over 35 years ago.\n \n Hence your argument is entirely relying upon speculation that she has not changed her views on Communism and Marxism in over 35 years.\n \n Explain to me how that is going to make a good argument that she is in fact a believer in the removal of Capitalism and for a classless society. \n \n \nJust as the logical error in concluding that Johnny is a commie because he wears a red hat when everyone knows that commies wear red hats does not make Johnny a commie, the fact that Hillary may appear to you to be acting oppositely to one thing that you consider to be a litmus test for a Marxist does not mean that she cannot be one.\n\n \n So your argument is that she may, based on no actual evidence, be a Marxist? \n \n Simply because she isn't acting like one does make her one? What kind of asinine argument is that?\n \n Well then. You're a Marxist because you are acting opposite to what Marxist do to pretend you're not a Marxist. Bush is a Marxist and acts differently to hide from being a Marxist. \n \n This is completely ridiculous. You're calling someone a Marxist based on pure, idle speculation.\n \n And you wonder why Kronus made the comment about how much lunacy your argument has.\n \n \nIf I recall correctly, you tried a similar approach in the Natural thread some time ago, likely hoping to dupe us all into agreeing that everything you do is natural. You do have a way with trying to slip through the back door.\n\n \n I did no such thing. That argument was very simple. Humans are a part of nature. Homosexual activity is found in nature. Therefore homosexual activity is natural. Things found in a state of nature are natural. Not really hard to figure out. \n \n \nHillary is Marxist.\n\n \n Based on pure speculation, without any proof on the logic that simply because she isn't acting like one makes her one.\n \n That doesn't answer my question and it raises a few more.\n \n Jim is implicitly arguing that he knows more then lawyers, doctors and the heads of numerous large corporations about the nature of Hillary.\n \n Please tell me, what makes you think you are smarter and more knowledgeable then people with advanced degrees, CFOs, and JDs all of which are trained very well to do analytical critical thinking?",
