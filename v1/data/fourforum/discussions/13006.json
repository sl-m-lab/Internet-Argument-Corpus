If the same survey methodology is used to measure both criminal and defensive gun use, many more people will report that they have been a victim of a gun crime than having used a gun in self defense. Most of the \"defensive gun uses\" reported in studies that ask every respondent directly about gun use are actually criminal uses of guns.\n\n \n In other words. If it is or was illegal to carry a gun in your state, and your life was threatened, and you carried a gun because you believed that it is better to be judged by 12, rather than to be carried by 6, what you did was a criminal use of a gun to protect yourself! \n \n My story of a Defensive Gun Use. So, what would you do.\n \n I became disabled and had to retrain for a new career. I had no family that could help so I had to move into a Cleveland Housing projects while I went back to college. While there I saw massive drug dealing, which also drew prostitution, and gambling. I saw street or parking lot gambling, public intoxication and public urination, and an occasional dead body, all from the drug dealing. However, I figured that the drug dealers weren't bothering me so what did I care. After all, I was only going to be there for a very short time and it is a victimless crime right? Just like Mexico! emoticon_smile\n \n Uh huh!\n \n Allow me to expel a few falsehoods. First of all, most every one of the drug dealers were NOT residence of the housing project, and neither were they the majority of their customers. Most all of the residents, although many were undereducated, were, in fact, good-harted people who were, for the most part, good neighbors too.\n \n I was speaking to a neighbor, single mother of 2, and she was telling me that her children do not sleep on their beds at night. When I pressed her about this, she embarrassed admitted that they sleep under their beds because of the almost nightly gunfire from the Drug dealers, and their patrons. Not residents. Most of the gun fire was from the drug dealers showing off, I am figuring, or testing out a gun being traded for crack. Any way, when I heard this, I lost my Natural mind. I thought to myself that in no way would I allow this to go on while I was still alive and on this Earth, and while I could still do something about it. I called the cops and was referred to the Housing police. They said they would do as much as they can, but their efforts were pretty ineffective. So I video taped all of the actors doing their crimes and took telephoto still pictures for positive identification and never told a sole that I was doing it because just before this, a church worker was murdered by the drug dealers because he inadvertently video taped a drug dealer while producing a video to try and spur donations. \n \n I mailed it to the Housing police and told my Senator, John Glenn about everything and his office got involved. They told the Housing authority, and the DEA, I think and contacted my Ohio State elected officials. There was an attempt to clean up the problem but it was not in any way what I thought the effort should be since the evidence I gathered had them dead to rights. They instead said they were going to concentrate their efforts on the Drug Buyers instead of the sellers. I thought, What? That isn't going to solve anything, but I waited to see the results. Nothing! Absolutely Nothing, but a show.\n \n It was not long after the show that the son of a neighbor came over and told me that Moody, the head of the drug dealers, was going to kill me, because he somehow found out about the video tapes and the photos. I talked to the Cleveland Police and was again referred to the housing police, so I went down to their off ice and talked it over with the Captain. He informed me that I was, indeed, in a heap of danger. I asked him what I could do and he told me that if I did not own a gun to buy one and carry it. He explained that (Before Ohio's CCW laws) there was a statute on the books called the prudent man defense. It seemed that the Ohio legislators in their wisdom, did not want to make any laws that violated common sense and put the law abiding in a trick bag for running afoul of a law that they could in no way obey. Hence, the Prudent Man Defense. \n \n To make a painfully long story short, I was once confronted by a drug dealer, and I produced my pistol. After that, all of the Drug Dealers left me along, but was told that Moody was still planning to kill me. \n \n My friend from school knows a Cleveland Cop and told him about what was happening to me with a whole bunch of harassment and vandalism, and my friend was told by the cop, \" Let the Black uneducated people kill each other! My friend explained that I was white and a Veteran and that I did not deserve to be left totally unprotected the way I was, and the cop again said, \" I Said! Let the Negroes Kill each other.\" Which was extremely typical of my experience there.\n \n At any rate, Moody was shortly arrested and convicted of murdering someone else and the Drug Dealers moved down as far away from me as they could. Before I left, only two people were ever arrested. Moody and another drug dealer, but no arrest were ever made even after all of the evidence I presented.\n \n So you can blow and go all you want to, but guns also save lives. And what I did would be counted as a criminal act by Galileo, and his survey!",

So why are you actively supporting laws that would leave their intended targets disarmed and helpless?\n \n \n\"After controlling for other aspects of the surveys, these surveys indicate that criminal gun use is far more common that self-defense gun use. For example, in May 2000, a Washington Post national random-digit dial survey asked 'Not counting military service, have you ever been threatened with a gun or shot at?' Twenty-three percent (23%) said yes.

Seven percent (7%) of respondents said yes....\n\n \n We've been over this before, countless times in fact, but you and your side continue to play ignorant!\n \n Phone surveys are unreliable and can't be entered into evidence one way or another, because there's no way to ensure the results are factual. Everyone lies on the phone, you know that as well as we do. Everyone here has gotten away from a telemarketer or family member through outright and bold faced lying. If people will lie to a telemarketer, they'll lie on a phone survey asking personal and private questions as well.\n \n There's also no way to guarantee that this so called \"random phone survey\" didn't intentionally handpick people out of special interest states like California or New York to shape the results as they want.\n \n However if you want to use random phone surveys, we're gonna use them against you and show how wrong you are. In the first survey you mentioned only 23% of people responded that they'd been shot at or threatened by someone armed with a gun. That means 77%, more than three quarters of the number questioned, have never been threatened. That fact alone tears down your entire position.\n \n \n\"So how can anyone claim that there are more self-defense gun uses than criminal gun uses? They do so by comparing different types of surveys. They compare the results of Box B with Box C! However, it is completely inappropriate to compare estimates which come from two radically different survey methodologies.....\n\n \n This is very hypocritical of you. You use the Kellerman study anytime it fits your agenda, yet Kellerman only compared murder rates to create a very biased paper to support his anti-gun agenda.\n \n \n\"Second, there is no accepted understanding of what constitutes a criminal or a self-defense gun use. For example, criminals often believe that their gun use during a crime was in self-defense...\n\n \n You've said some very ignorant things before in the past, but this may be a new standard. You're telling me that if someone walks into a school and starts shooting students in the back of the head execution style, that can't be considered a criminal use of a firearm because there are no established guidelines about what is illegal and what isn't?\n \n \n\"The opportunity for a law-abiding gun owner to use a gun in a socially desirable manner--against a criminal during the commission of a crime--will occur, for the average gun owner, perhaps once in a lifetime.\n\n \n So what? I don't care! Gun ownership is an individual right and that's the end of it! You don't have to exercise a right hundreds of thousands of times a year for it to be protected by the Constitution.\n \n \nIt is a rare event. Other than self-defense, the use of a gun against another human is socially undesirable. Regular citizens with guns, who are sometimes tired, angry, drunk, or afraid, and who are not trained in dispute resolution, have lots of opportunities for inappropriate gun uses. People engage in innumerable annoying and somewhat hostile interactions with each other in the course of a lifetime. It should not be surprising that inappropriate, socially undesirable 'self-defense' gun uses by people who believe they are law-abiding citizens outnumber the appropriate and socially beneficial use of guns.6\"\n http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/hicrc/files/Bullet-ins_Spring_2009.pdf\n\n \n And yet the Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center can come up with only a handful of incidents where a concealed carry holder assaulted another. Not even 300 incidents, as opposed to countless hundreds of thousands of concealed carry holders who have never done anything wrong. The math speaks for itself, you lose this one as well.\n \n \nWhat do we learn? The claim that guns are used much more often in self defense is based on making inappropriate comparisons. If the same survey methodology is used to measure both criminal and defensive gun use, many more people will report that they have been a victim of a gun crime than having used a gun in self defense. Most of the \"defensive gun uses\" reported in studies that ask every respondent directly about gun use are actually criminal uses of guns.\n\n \n This is why we have a judicial system, to decide what is and isn't legal. A drug lord can claim that their killing of a rival was self-defense because they had to protect their turf, but just because they say so doesn't mean it's the truth.",

For example, criminals often believe that their gun use during a crime was in self-defense...\n \n \"The opportunity for a law-abiding gun owner to use a gun in a socially desirable manner--against a criminal during the commission of a crime--will occur, for the average gun owner, perhaps once in a lifetime. It is a rare event. Other than self-defense, the use of a gun against another human is socially undesirable. Regular citizens with guns, who are sometimes tired, angry, drunk, or afraid, and who are not trained in dispute resolution, have lots of opportunities for inappropriate gun uses. People engage in innumerable annoying and somewhat hostile interactions with each other in the course of a lifetime. It should not be surprising that inappropriate, socially undesirable 'self-defense' gun uses by people who believe they are law-abiding citizens outnumber the appropriate and socially beneficial use of guns.6\"\n http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/hicrc/files/Bullet-ins_Spring_2009.pdf\n \n What do we learn? The claim that guns are used much more often in self defense is based on making inappropriate comparisons. If the same survey methodology is used to measure both criminal and defensive gun use, many more people will report that they have been a victim of a gun crime than having used a gun in self defense. Most of the \"defensive gun uses\" reported in studies that ask every respondent directly about gun use are actually criminal uses of guns.\n\n \n I learned a few things from the post. The author claimed \"most households don't have guns\". According to 1997 stats, 25% of ALL US adults owned firearms. If you assume that there are typically two adults per household, that means 50% of households have guns, so the statement is false.\n On a personal note, someone tried to break into my brother's apartment shortly after he was married. He quickly opened the door, yelled \"freeze MFer or I'll blow your head off!\" while holding a short-barrelled shotgun and watched the perp #### himself. being half asleep and in possession of a slightly modified shotgun, my brother didn't call the cops to report this self-defensive use of a firearm.",

   "I believe the RKBA is a fundamental right of man, and I have promoted that view here. Does this mean I am guilty of neglecting other rights? I don't think so, Iangb.\n \n You use child pornography as an example. I agree that the undefined term \"freedom of speech\" is broad enough to cover child porn, and that a law prohibiting it infringes upon free speech. Yet I have no problem with making it illegal. You may say then that I must believe that all rights are equal, but some are more equal than others. Absolutely not. \n \n I have said this many times: No right is absolute. In your example of child porn the justification for the infringement is the government's compelling state interest in preventing child molestation. This is why to convict someone of manufacturing, distributing, or possessing child porn I must prove that the image is of an actual person under the age of 18 as opposed to a computer generated image. This is why actual child porn is illegal but cartoon child porn is not.\n \n Likewise, freedom of religion is not defined, but the right is not absolute enough to permit human sacrifice. And yes, the otherwise undefined RKBA is not absolute-despite extremists on BOTH sides of the GC debate arguing that it is absolute. \n \n With this in mind I'll turn to your statement: \n \n \n The question then becomes, 'where do you draw the line between freedom and security'? \n\n \n The problem today is too many people think we need to redraw this line in absolutist terms-and it always seems that those who get the best protections are the ones holding the chalk. For example, we can bend the line around Guantanamo because that's somebody else. Locking those guys up does not affect me (or so they argue). The same goes for those who want to draw the line to white out the RKBA. By their own personal choices they have already surrendered their RKBA-why then should someone else be allowed to choose otherwise? It's always easy to give up a right in exchange for perceived security when it is viewed as being someone else's right.\n \n Personally, I think my founders did a fair job of drawing that line with my Bill of Rights. I believe all of the rights expressed there exist. I'm unwilling to allow someone else to give away my RKBA, but I recognize the right is subject to limitation. I have no problem with felons forfeiting their right by their actions, for example. \n \n Now too often talking GC here is like talking health care reform in Washington. People try to avoid responsibility and criticism by confining themselves to broad and vague platitudes while avoiding specifics-which I generally find to be a waste of time. \n \n And so my question for you, Iangb, is if I put the chalk in your hands then where would you draw the line? Are there specific firearms laws you are willing to propose for discussion? \n \n --- \n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, New haven, 1921.\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\" Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) Justice Brandeis, dissenting.",

Right now.\n \n \nSo throwing more guns at the problem doesn't seem to make much sense.\n\n \n Can you present anything to support your claim that we're suggesting \"throwing more guns at the problem\"? I haven't seen any such claims on the side of conservatives. We support letting people who already have guns actually being allowed to carry them, but I haven't seen anyone saying that we have to get hundreds of thousands of more guns bought up and distributed.\n \n Have you?\n \n \nAnd how do you reconcile gun ownership with this principle of personal self defense when guns are used much more often to victimize people than in self defense? I suspect that you do not really believe in the principle of personal self defense.\n\n \n It's quite simple really. We as gun owners aren't violating the rights of anyone. The criminal element isn't connected with us, and taking away our gun rights isn't going to stop them. And since we support criminals being locked up, or just plain killed, we're not the source of the problem. Nor are we supporting the criminal misuse of firearms.\n \n Just because criminals steal and use cars for high speed chases doesn't mean that we should ban car ownership, does it? Just because arsonists burn down entire buildings and kill families with a book of matches, doesn't mean that we should ban them either, does it?\n \n Instead of focusing exclusively on legal gun owners, and harassing us like it's all our fault, like we're the source of all evil in the world, why don't you instead go after the criminals who're actually breaking the laws repeatedly, because they were given a plea bargain that kept them out of prison?",

I answer that question in the post you responded to; I would attempt to draw it in a place which maximises neither freedom nor security, but instead focuses on maximising the quality of life of the population as a whole.\n \n Personally, I think that the UK system is too prohibitive (sporting-wise).

In order to buy a gun (or, possibly, ammo), you must have a license.\n 2.

'Sport' or 'work' motives must include evidence that they actually are using their firearm for the stated purpose.\n 4. Possible further requirements for a license: A practical/theory test similar to a UK driving test, to show that the owner is not entirely incompetent and likely to only harm others or themselves.\n 5. Licence holders may, on private property, allow non-licensed individuals to handle and use guns. However, any harm that results from this is considered to be directly caused by the license owner.\n 6.

   "Where would I draw the line? I answer that question in the post you responded to; I would attempt to draw it in a place which maximises neither freedom nor security, but instead focuses on maximising the quality of life of the population as a whole.\n \n Personally, I think that the UK system is too prohibitive (sporting-wise). However, it does have several good features. The end result I would probably go for (skipping details of how it was introduced, which would be incredibly tricky to do) would be:\n 1. In order to buy a gun (or, possibly, ammo), you must have a license.\n 2. In order to get a license, you must provide a 'valid' reason for owning one, and proof that you are unlikely to misuse one.\n 3. A 'valid' reason for owning a gun would be: sport, work or 'other' (must be specific). In general (with some exceptions), 'self-defence' should not be considered a valid reason for owning a gun. 'Sport' or 'work' motives must include evidence that they actually are using their firearm for the stated purpose.\n 4. Possible further requirements for a license: A practical/theory test similar to a UK driving test, to show that the owner is not entirely incompetent and likely to only harm others or themselves.\n 5. Licence holders may, on private property, allow non-licensed individuals to handle and use guns. However, any harm that results from this is considered to be directly caused by the license owner.\n 6. Set up a gun registry database, to contain: Make, model, current owner, id number and date of purchase/sale - nothing more. Gun thefts to be reported on discovery, lest the individual be suspected of selling on guns illegally.\n \n Yes, this would (likely) involve drastically changing the 2nd amendment. Precedent for changing (or, rather, removing) amendments has already been set by the 21st, however.\n \n Incidentally, thanks for responding. No-one else seems to have \n managed.\n\n \n GOOD GOD! why not just hand them in?because that is basically what your saying! drastically changing the 2nd amendment?sounds like it would be just #### canned!emoticon_xkill",

   "Somehow, I think I'm better qualified to judge quality of life in the UK than you, seeing as I actually live here.\n\n \n I lived in England with my family for the most of my life. My family lived in the UK going as far back as my great, great grandparents. I have plenty of experience with how like in England was.\n \n You're hardly the best one to make judgments about the quality of life over there.

You're so ingrained in the Orwellian world that Britain has become, you can't notice the forest through the trees.\n \n \nSo you're against background checks for guns in the US?\n\n \n No I have no problem with standard background checks. But when you start suggest that that's not enough, I draw the line at that point. If I can pass the background check then I see no reason why I should be subjected to any further hoops to jump through before I can exercise my rights that you don't believe in.\n \n This is off topic though. Passing the background check means having clean records. Clean records mean, in the eye of the law, you're not likely to commit harm or misuse with a firearm. This is the rule, not the exception.\n \n \nHow about background checks for working in schools? How about driving tests?\n\n \n Undergoing a background check to obtain a position of employment is not the same thing, and it's not comparable in this matter either. Also, driving is a privilege, not a right so it's not comparable either.\n \n \nYou seem to be going for the 'blow statements out of proportion' tactic, but - it would cut down the likelihood, yes.\n\n \n So you're telling us that what amounts to a 15 minute interview can prove conclusively that a person either will or won't, at a later point in time, prove their own stupidity while armed? How can you guarantee this?\n \n Even the stupidest, most incompetent people ever born, can prove capable enough during a driving test to get a license, but these are the same people who later get wasted and try to drive home from a party, or drag race in the streets because they thought somebody was challenging their masculinity by passing them on the road.\n \n What you're proposing has no crime fighting potential, no method of guaranteeing people would be less accident prone, and sounds like nothing more than an intentional inconvenience to those who wish to live differently than you.\n \n \nIf you ask someone to put the safety back on and they pull the trigger instead, that's a fairly good sign they shouldn't own a gun yet.\n\n \n How exactly is that a sign of anything conclusive?\n \n \nIf you've deliberately allowed them to get to the gun, and had the opportunity to prevent them from doing so but deliberately failed, then I would say it's pretty much your own fault you got shot, yes?\n\n \n What you're talking about; knowingly supplying a weapon to an individual you had reason to know was prohibited from possession, is already a felony offense.\n \n \nNot a clue.

You want us to repeat the exact same mistakes that both England and Australia made?

In the suburbs where guns are also plentiful I might add. Hardly no crime, maybe a murder every ten years or so, maybe a few break ins, and some domestic squabbles, is about it, when living in the suburbs. So we know it can be done, but it will take money and effort, on our part. The solutions our government tried only became a way to make a living without the effort. I am speaking of welfare.

More self defence and more criminal use, not 'or'.\n \n Uh, did you see an \"or\" in that? Nope, none there! If you get more self-defense, you will have less criminals and criminal use because of loss of criminals getting shot in their profession. Perhaps you are confused and view self-defense as a criminal act in which case you would be WRONG as self defense has been and will continue to be a lawful exercise of an inalienable right. It is not vigilatism!! This is something garnished from the plate of the anti-Constitutionalist and some in law enforcement who are envious of the fact that most folks are perfectly capeable of taking care of themselves while they see a decreased need for their services and rightly fear for their reason to exist. They can become highly emotional about it. I kind of suspect that you have something to do related to law enforcement? Just a feeling and no need to answer that one. At least you are a pleasant fellow to talk to and not \"a cheeky fellow\" as some of your countrymen are :)\n \n Earlier, I posted a reference to John Lott's studies and book of More guns equal Less Crime. The majority of antis get sidetracked claiming gun control equals crime control but get overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary. That the right to self-defense has always existed as a fundamental and unalienable right in this Republic. Even 'the wise latina' hem and hawed claiming not to know there was any cases supporting the right to self defense. There are: Sotomayer Overlooks All 14 Supreme Court Self-Defense Cases\n \n Is your claim that self-defense equals more criminals or criminal misuse? When they jailed the farmer for shooting at violent yobs and criminal trespassers in your nation of GB, did you agree with that decision in your country?\n \n Sorry about the delay in getting back to you but the old man is a bit busy today and I need to finish my loop, gotta eat too you know? :)",

Canada doesn't even have half the number of guns we do, and their database is costing them $2 billion in taxpayer money. There's no way the American budget could feed such a beast.\n \n And besides that, the registry would only have the information of those willing to obey the laws, IE the people who aren't going to go out and shoot and kill others for the fun of it. The list would be useless as a crime fighting tools. The guns they would recover would never be in the registry, and even if they were by some chance, it'd be discovered that they were reported as stolen at a previous date, or that the registered owner had been killed and his guns stolen.\n \n \nWhy? Someone has been unlawfully killed by what you are claiming should be an 'inalienable right', regardless of other circumstances.\n\n \n Guess what, we don't care. Criminal misuse is no excuse for declaring war on our rights.\n \n Even if our crooked politicians could implement Britain-style gun control in America, that wouldn't do a thing to approach the problem. Our criminal element, which imports drugs from overseas and across the borders, could easily order in new weapons as well. The borders are too porous to keep drug shipments out, weapon shipments wouldn't be any easier to stop.\n \n Of course you really don't care about that fact. To you it's just irrelevant. This has been brought up before and all you or the other gun control supporters have to say in response is \"but it'll make the numbers lower\" as if that somehow makes things better and more acceptable. Well it's not. The only numbers that'll be lower, will be the number of criminals killed by home owners in self defense.\n \n When are you going to get it through your head, that de-horning the ram won't address the issue of the wolf?\n \n \nAnd... we return to the \"if we ban guns, we should also ban cars/cameras/the internet!\" argument. \n\n \n It's the truth. You can't talk about banning only one thing that can be used to harm others, unless you're willing to consider applying the same standard to everything else that has played some role in harming or killing others.",

The criminal is going to be more likely to strike at a time and place where their victim has a lesser chance of being armed. Perhaps this simple concept explains your statistics?",

   "Good lord iangb. You want us to repeat the exact same mistakes that both England and Australia made? Spend our time and money on taking guns away from the law-abiding, who are NOT the problem, while the criminals import their guns in with their drugs? Gun control is NOT Crime Control! How many millions of crime fighting dollars do we need to waste in order to get that message? \n \n As we have seen from other threads, there is a substitution effect! What both England and Australia are learning from us, is that you control crime with good cops, and better crime fighting techniques and equipment! \n \n Who commits murder, is the question we need to ask. Then how do we stop it? \n \n What we here in the U.S. can learn from both England and Australia is what role proper socialization plays in creating a society that respects life. Our inner city drug dealers have been socialized by the previous gangs and drug dealers who are creating a revolving door of these exact same problems. Racism, the previous institution of slavery have also created a backlash that is coming back to haunt good people who must live in these inner city death traps! Solve some of these problems and we might have a chance! Gun control socializes no one!\n \n If you are lucky enough to live in one of our better suburbs, you can't even understand the gravity of the inner city problems because we are so far removed from their life conditions. In the suburbs where guns are also plentiful I might add. Hardly no crime, maybe a murder every ten years or so, maybe a few break ins, and some domestic squabbles, is about it, when living in the suburbs. So we know it can be done, but it will take money and effort, on our part. The solutions our government tried only became a way to make a living without the effort. I am speaking of welfare. What the inner city youth need is proper role models, not gun control!\n\n \n Sounds like Ian wants to put old doc out of business? Just wait until he gets government health care----oh, he already does, tough.\n \n *Footnote. When anti-gun activists list the number of deaths per year from firearms, they neglect to mention that 60 percent of the 30,000 figure they often use are suicides. They also fail to mention that at least three-quarters of the 12,000 homicides are criminals killing other criminals in disputes over illicit drugs, or police shooting criminals engaged in felonies. Subtracting those, we are left with no more than 3,000 deaths that I think most would consider truly lamentable.\n \n Firearms in America: The Facts\n \n Martin L. Fackler, MD\n Monday, Dec. 25, 2000 \n I must confess to being a member of a very dangerous group. I am a physician: We cause more than 100,000 deaths per year in the USA by mistakes and various degrees of carelessness in treating our patients. Why does society tolerate us? \n Because we save far more patients than we kill. Firearms are entirely analogous. Although used in far fewer deaths* - they are used to prevent about 75 crimes for each death. Firearms, like physicians, prevent far more deaths than they cause.

   "I hate that old rehashed lies keep getting repeated and reworded like it is an original or recent finding when it is just a reposting of an old gun control lie.\n \n The title posted by star gazer is a misleading lie in itself.\n \n Ian posts reasons he thinks should revoke a right we fought a revolution over and one that is strictly prohibited from interference from any government infrigement.

   "Where would I draw the line? I answer that question in the post you responded to; I would attempt to draw it in a place which maximises neither freedom nor security, but instead focuses on maximising the quality of life of the population as a whole.\n \n Personally, I think that the UK system is too prohibitive (sporting-wise). However, it does have several good features. The end result I would probably go for (skipping details of how it was introduced, which would be incredibly tricky to do) would be:\n 1. In order to buy a gun (or, possibly, ammo), you must have a license.\n 2. In order to get a license, you must provide a 'valid' reason for owning one, and proof that you are unlikely to misuse one.\n 3. A 'valid' reason for owning a gun would be: sport, work or 'other' (must be specific). In general (with some exceptions), 'self-defence' should not be considered a valid reason for owning a gun. 'Sport' or 'work' motives must include evidence that they actually are using their firearm for the stated purpose.\n 4. Possible further requirements for a license: A practical/theory test similar to a UK driving test, to show that the owner is not entirely incompetent and likely to only harm others or themselves.\n 5. Licence holders may, on private property, allow non-licensed individuals to handle and use guns. However, any harm that results from this is considered to be directly caused by the license owner.\n 6. Set up a gun registry database, to contain: Make, model, current owner, id number and date of purchase/sale - nothing more. Gun thefts to be reported on discovery, lest the individual be suspected of selling on guns illegally.\n \n Yes, this would (likely) involve drastically changing the 2nd amendment. Precedent for changing (or, rather, removing) amendments has already been set by the 21st, however.\n \n Incidentally, thanks for responding. No-one else seems to have managed.\n\n \n Let me first address your specific proposals in this post. I want to return more to your \"maximizing quality of life for the population as a whole\" post later.\n \n #1 Licensing the RKBA. I disagree with this. I believe individual rights exist to provide a check on the power of government. It is the right of the individual against governmental action. The government has no ownership interest in an individual right, and it is not the government's prerogative to license it. We either have to accept the RKBA as a right, in which case allowing the government the power to license the right encourages the government to attempt to license other rights; or we declare it is not a right. \n \n #2 Proof of valid reason for a license. For the reasons stated above I believe this is a bad idea. As an aside, how would you prove to a government official you were unlikely to misuse a firearm?\n \n #3. Self defense not a \"valid reason\" for having a gun. I believe that self-defense is the first law of nature, and for that reason I disagree with your proposal. But assume I got a gun under your system for sporting purposes and happened to use it in self-defense, then would that be lawful under your system? Assume, for example, that a man broke into my home with a pry bar and tried to use it to kill me. If self-defense cannot be a purpose for having a firearm, then would you also abolish the right of self-defense altogether? Or would it be modified to deny the right of self-defense with firearms? In other words, would it be illegal to kill or wound in self-defense entirely? Or, would it be illegal to defend myself with my sporting purpose shotgun, but still OK to defend myself with a well-aimed swing of a 7 iron or baseball bat?\n \n #4 Proficiency testing as part of the license. Because I believe it is a right, then I do not believe you could require me to demonstrate proficiency any more than I would encourage the thought that the government could require me to prove I am literate before I can buy a book; or make me pass a religious history test before I could go to a church of my choice. Of course, if I misuse the firearm then lack of proficiency is always a factor in determining criminal and civil liability for my actions.\n \n #5. I do not believe we should license the exercise of a right on private property. I also prefer the existing agency liability laws we have. \n \n #6. I have spoken before about registration http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/12552-editorial-we-want-them-registered.html#post349631 and mandatory theft reporting: http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/11679-what-your-knowledge-level-5.html#post326703 \n \n I agree, as you have noted, that all of your proposals are permissible if the individual right is abolished by amending it out of the Constitution. My complaint against the Brady Campaign and others who have advanced the fraudulent \"collective right/state's right\" theory is they have attempted to do in the courts what they know they lack the political power to do at the ballot box.",

   "Iangb:\n \n I went back and re-read your \"maximizing quality of life for the population as a whole\" post again http://www.4forums.com/political/342035-post81.html \n \n When you asked the question of where to \"draw the line between freedom and security,\" my answer was we did it by recognizing and defining certain individual rights. \n \n But I want to give a more complete answer to your post now because I've given it some thought and I find myself in disagreement with it. The problem I have with your post is I read it to redefine the limitation on government action away from respecting individual rights to focus instead on this \"maximizes the quality of life for the population as a whole\" ideal. I read this to be the ultimate question in your post, and if the answer is \"yes, the law meets that goal\" then the concept of individual rights must yield when they are believed to be in conflict with the legislative goal. \n \n Please correct me if I am misunderstanding this. \n \n I have no problem initially with your legislative goal to \"maximize the quality of life for the population as a whole.\" But when this goal comes into conflict with individual rights, then I believe the individual right must always trump this policy goal. I believe that to allow otherwise invites tyranny. \n \n Now I know \"tyranny\" is almost a 4 letter word here-kind of like saying \"Nazi.\" But this is not what I mean with the word. I don't believe allowing your goal to triumph over individual rights would bring about a tyrant dictator in America. We are after all a majority rule democracy. Rather, I fear allowing your goal to trump an individual rights model would bring about the tyranny of the majority. \n \n We know that in a democracy the question of what \"maximizes the quality of life for the population as a whole\" has always been answered by the will of the majority-what the majority thinks is best. With that in mind, the individual rights model we adopted in America works towards this balancing principle: \"majority rule, but respect for minority rights.\" \n \n I believe that respect for these rights of the individual should be the ultimate goal of any legislation. I do not believe we can safely set this principle aside in favor of a vague \"maximizes the quality of life for the population as a whole\" standard. To our shame we have done it before. \n \n In my nation it was the will of the political majority that kept black men enslaved for decades. In my opinion the supreme irony of the Revolutionary War was that (in my state at least) the same men who cried the loudest to \"take up arms against the tyrant king\" had with equal clarity of conviction decided that keeping the black man unarmed and enslaved to them would \"maximize the quality of life for the population as a whole.\"\n \n It was the same will of the majority that decided the policy of denying the RKBA to and forcing the migration of the Native American to \"reservations\" would act to \"maximize the quality of life for the population as a whole.\"\n \n It was the same will of the majority that decided a policy of forcing both the disarmament of and the concentration style internment of the Japanese American in World War II would act to \"maximize the quality of life for the population as a whole\" (with the belief that it would ensure security from spying and sabotage) \n \n And surely the goal of \"maximizing the quality of life for the population as a whole\" (through the belief it would provide greater domestic security) is the policy consideration behind holding suspected terrorists indefinitely without trial at Guantanamo Bay. \n \n The bottom line, as I see it, is this....If your goal of \"maximizing the quality of life for the population as a whole\" is not forced to yield when it infringes upon individual rights, then the will of the majority will undoubtedly pervert your goal to read \"whatever is in our collective best interest, regardless of how it punishes those not with us,\" and we will hear Thucydides remind us that: \"The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.\" \n \n Now I agree we can look back on the history of my nation and see many examples of how having these individual rights did not protect minorities or individuals from the tyranny of the majority. But if these circumstances existed then they are not the fault of the liberties themselves. Rather, they happened because of the fault of those in power who broke their oaths to protect and defend those rights when asked to do so by the tyranny of an irritated majority-and the actions of weak minded or self serving public servants in the past do not justify the abandonment of these rights today. \n \n I know the RKBA is unpopular with some in power in Washington. But what cannot be doubted now is that this individual right is indeed listed in the BoR alongside the rights of freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly, to not have soldiers quartered in your house, to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, to remain silent when accused of a crime, to a grand jury indictment before trial, to a trial by jury, to representation at trial, to confront and cross-examine your accusers, to the presumption of innocence and the requirement of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, to be free of cruel and unusual punishments. I believe these rights exist to draw the line between freedom and security. If we concede to those in power today the authority to eliminate the RKBA because they feel it interferes with their goal of \"maximizing the quality of life for the population as a whole,\" then we concede to those in power tomorrow the same authority to tell us they can eliminate any other right in the BoR if it interferes with their similar policy goal. If there ever existed a slippery slope, then surely this would be it.\n \n But I don't want to misread what you said in your \"maximizes the quality of life for the population as a whole\" post, or infer something into it which was not intended. If I have, then please let me know. Regardless of whether I have or not I welcome your comments. \n \n ---\n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, New haven, 1921.\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\" Olmstead v.

   "From the Houston Chronicle of July 23, 2009\n 74-year-old man shoots carjacker in SW Houston\n \n A 74-year-old man shot and wounded a teenager who attempted to carjack him with a knife early this morning in southwest Houston, police said.\n \n The 18-year-old male suspect was wounded in the abdomen and was caught by police after he tried to run away following the shooting. He was taken to Ben Taub General Hospital in fair condition.\n \n No other injuries were reported.\n \n Police have not released the suspect's name because no charges have been filed against him, but investigators said that he will mostly likely be charged with aggravated robbery.\n \n The shooting happened outside a home in the 10900 block of Corona in southwest Houston about 6:30 a.m., police said.\n \n The victim, August Peters, had just parked his car in front of his wife's home when he noticed another car drive past him and park at the curb across the street.\n \n When the victim got out of his car, he told investigators that the teen came up to him and pressed a knife against his throat.\n \n \"He said, 'Give me your car or I'll kill you,'\" said Victor Senties, a spokesman for the Houston Police Department.\n \n The victim was able to reach inside his car to get a pistol. He fired two shots at the suspect, Senties said.\n \n The suspect ran into the driveway of a home across the street and then somehow got into the home. He broke a window to get out and continued running away. Senties said no one was at the home at the time.\n \n Police found the teen moments later on bridge on Wilcrest near Bellaire about two blocks from where he was shot.\n \n Investigators are uncertain if the teenager got out of the car the victim had seen park on the street. They have no description of the vehicle and no other suspects at this time.\n \n From WLEX of July 21, 2009\n Intruder Fatally Shot By Homeowner In Garrard County\n \n Police are investigating after they say a man was shot to death early Tuesday morning while trying to break into a home in Garrard County.\n \n The incident happened at about 12:45 a.m. at a home on Old Richmond Road. Kentucky State Police said Dallas Richard Helton, 40, had broken into the back of the home, and was shot once in the chest by the homeowner, Herlin McQuerry, 67. Helton stumbled out to the driveway where police said he died.\n \n Police said McQuerry also fired a shot at the alleged getaway car being driven by Tonya Fowler, 35, of Berea. She was later arrested and charged with complicity to commit burglary second degree.\n \n Helton's 17-year-old son was also in the vehicle. Police questioned him, but have not charged him.\n \n Helton's family claims they were looking at rental property. However, Kentucky State Police said Helton was wearing a black ski mask and armed with a crowbar. Police added McQuerry's house was not listed for rent.\n \n No charges will be filed against McQuerry in the case.\n \n From the July 22, 2009 Anchorage Daily News:\n \n Daniel Ames reckons he dealt one for the good guys on Saturday night near Soldotna when he came home, found two burglars in his house, wrestled with them over a pistol, then took them down, telling them he was going to blow off their knees if they didn't start following his orders.\n \n \n One of the two 21-year-olds charged with the burglary turned out to be Ames' next-door neighbor, according to a report from the Alaska State Troopers. The young man registered a blood alcohol content of .418, which is more than five times the legal limit to drive.\n \n Ames called the young men bandits. \n \n The 49-year-old construction worker was returning home from work on Saturday around 9 p.m. when a neighbor told him some kids were wandering around near his home, which was being remodeled. \n \n He rushed home to find his neighbor, Chance Tallman, and Joshua Simons trying to walk out of his house with a $125 ceiling fan, he said. \n \n Ames said he wasn't going to let those guys get away with burglary. \n \n \"What are you two buttheads doing in my house?\" he said.\n \n To that, apparently, one of the young men said, \"Who are you calling buttheads?\" and began to pull out a Glock pistol. \n \n Ames grabbed for it and began wrestling, thrashing Tallman's hand against wall studs to loosen his grip. The gun broke loose and then, according to Ames, the men looked ready to carry on with their fists. That's when he pulled out his own concealed weapon, also a Glock. He shot into the ground to let the burglars know he was serious, he said.\n \n He told the men to get down on their knees. If they didn't, he was going to blow off their kneecaps. \n \n He had them. Drama over. Good guy wins. Or so he says.\n \n Tallman told troopers a different story. He was merely trespassing, picked up the fan to admire it, thinking his mother would like it, and then Ames barged in the door, put him in a chokehold, then recklessly shot the gun into the floor.\n \n As for the Glock, that was his mother's, Tallman told the troopers. She showed up on the scene afterward and confirmed it was hers, troopers said.\n \n Simons admitted to troopers that he was trespassing but said he was only admiring the construction work. \n \n Troopers charged Tallman with burglary, theft, assault and misconduct with a weapon. Simons faces burglary and theft charges. \n \n Trooper Sgt. James Truesdell, who investigated the case, said that when he arrived Ames had both men on the ground in the front yard. A Glock 23 was on the ground with a round in the chamber. Ames told the trooper that he had taken the pistol from Tallman, Truesdell wrote in his report.\n \n The trooper said he didn't charge Ames with any crime but the district attorney may feel differently after reading the report. When asked what he meant, he read Alaska statutes on what constitutes legal defense of life and property.\n \n From the July 20, 2009 Tallahassee Democrat:\n \n BRISTOL #-Bradley Harvell, 82, closed the Slip N' Slide bar that is connected to his house on County Road 333 around 8 p.m. Sunday and walked inside his house an hour later. He ate some dinner dropped off by a neighbor and then went to bed.\n Harvell said a short time later, he heard a knock at the door.\n \n \"There were two knocks at my door,\" Harvell said. \"I didn't get up when I heard the first one. But I decided to go see who it was on the second knock.\"\n \n As Harvell cracked the door open to take a peek outside, a man dressed in a black T-shirt, black jeans with a blue bandanna covering his mouth, forced his way inside.\n \n Harvell said the man, later identified as Octavius Barnes, 24, of Sanford, Fla., shot him with a stun gun, causing Harvell to fall back on his bed. The intruder then pulled out what appeared to be a black pistol and demanded money.\n \n Harvell pulled out his money clip and gave the robber half of the cash. When pressed to give more, Harvell said he turned it all over.\n \n But Harvell then reached for his .357 magnum among a pile of papers on the floor next to his bed and shot Barnes near the stomach. Barnes fell over on the TV, knocking it onto Harvell, who fired another round, striking Barnes in the head.\n \n \"I did what I did to try and save myself,\" Harvell said Monday afternoon, after spending the night with his sister in Bristol. \"I'm 82-years-old. I've made it this far, and I want to keep on living.\"\n \n The call came in about 9:20 p.m., according to the Liberty County Sheriff's Office. When a deputy arrived, with her weapon drawn, Harvell said he told her, \"There's no need for the gun. I don't think he's going to get up and do anything else.\"\n \n From July 19, 2009 Detroit channel 4:\n \n PONTIAC, Mich. -- Neighbors in one community said a man was shot and killed early Sunday morning after he interrupted a neighborhood party and robbed some of the partygoers.\n \n \"It's like playground rules. They just broke one of them by going in and robbing and turning your back on someone,\" neighbor Andre said.\n \n Andre said 29-year-old Gregory Scott interupted a dice game in the basement of a house in the 300 block of Seward Street in Pontiac at about 3:30 a.m.\n \n Andre said Scott pulled a gun on partygoers and robbed them. \"He goes in, pulls out a gun, let off a shot or two to make the person come out his money, and he was fine with that and turned his back,\" Andre said. \"But everybody had pistols ... lights went off on him then.\"\n \n Andre said the man was shot several times as he ran up the stairs and out of the house.\n \n \"He made it outside. He fell outside,\" Andre said.\n \n Neighbors said two other people were also wounded but were able to walk away from the scene.\n \n From WVEC of July 16, 2009\n No charges against Suffolk store owner who shot suspect\n \n No charges will be filed against a man who shot and killed a would-be robber in his store, the Suffolk commonwealth's attorney announced Thursday.\n \n On the morning on June 21, the alarm went off at James Durden's Whaleyville store - J&L Food Mart. \n \n Durden, who lives close by, grabbed a gun and went to the store. His brother told 13News that Durden opened fire because he thought the man pointed a gun at him.\n \n That man, identified as Ernest Scott Roop, was struck four times.\n \n Detectives determined Roop was wearing camouflage clothing with his face concealed in a \"ninjna\" style fashion. They also said Roop had a hunting knife and crowbar and was wearing heavy construction gloves.\n \n In the letter to Police Chief Thomas Bennett, C. Phillip Ferguson stated, \"Mr. Durden was confronted with a very dangerous situation created by Roop and was legally justified in using deadly force as he genuinely believed that Roop had a firearm and that his own life was in danger.\n \n In addition, from a practical standpoint, convinced that a Suffolk jury would not convict Mr. Durden of criminal misconduct under the facts of this case.\n \n Therefore, this Office declines to prosecute any charges against Mr. Durden.\" \n \n From the Birmingham News of July 14, 2009\n Store owner says robber shot himself\n \n An owner of the Vineyard Food Market told The Birmingham News that a man shot himself dead as he ran after robbing the store on Tuesday night.\n \n The owner said he fired a shot at the fleeing man, who had grabbed money in the store and ran, but he did not think he had hit him.\n \n Police have not confirmed that account of the incident, but said the dead man had attempted to rob the store on Crestwood Boulevard.\n \n Jerry Tucker, owner of Crestwood Antiques a few doors down from Vineyard Food Market, was called to the scene because an alarm went off at his business after a bullet went through a window. Tucker, who has been in business there for eight years, said it's a nice community, but there is a lot of crime.\n \n Tucker said his son-in-law closed a computer store that he had owned in the same shopping center after several break-ins.\n \n Tucker said the owners of the Vineyard are well-liked by members of the community.\n \n \"This is tragic. They are really good folks,\" he said.\n \n From WAVE of July 16, 2009\n Homeowner subdues intruder until police arrive\n \n Police in Oldham County are investigating another apparent home invasion attempt. This time the homeowner subdued the alleged intruder until police could arrive.\n \n According to a press release from the Oldham County Police Department, officers were sent to the 1000 block of Goshen Lane about 1:30 a.m. Friday on a report of a home invasion burglary.\n \n When police arrived on scene, they found the home owner, Wes Johnson, and a houseguest, Richard Rackleffe, restraining 34-year-old Sherman Ellis from Louisville. \n \n Johnson told us it was about 1 a.m. Friday when Wes Johnson, his wife and their two out-of-town guests went to bed. About a half-hour later, Johnson says they heard something strange: the garage door opening and closing.\n \n \"We got out there and the garage was closed and we couldn't really figure out what was going on,\" Johnson said.\n \n They didn't know it then, but Ellis had cut open the top of the Johnson's convertible and used the garage door opener to get inside their home. \"When I walked back inside, I asked my wife to go up and call 911 and notify them that something was wrong,\" Johnson said.\n \n That's when he noticed something in the basement. \"I saw a closet door in our basement close. When I approached the door and kicked it open the guy came out and started to assault me,\" Johnson said.\n \n Johnson says he and Ellis continued to struggle. \"When somebody's coming at you in the darkness in the night and somebody comes at you with something in their hand to hit you, it helps you realize real quick that something's not right.\"\n \n Johnson says he yelled for his wife to bring him a pistol he had in the house. In the meantime, Johnson's guests - both former FBI agents - came running downstairs.\n \n \"The guy was fighting all he could,\" said Johnson's guest, Richard Rackleffe. I used to work with defense tactics and all I did was take the arm and put it in a twist, where he quit fighting and he just succumbed or submitted at that point.\"\n \n They held Ellis at gunpoint until police arrived and even then Johnson said Ellis fought officers, slightly injuring one before being handcuffed.\n \n Even though Johnson managed to get the upper hand, the experience has left him shaken. \"It definitely takes all the peace and comfort you have of going home and closing the door and knowing that you are in a safe place.\"\n \n Police say Ellis lives in Portland, and told Johnson he was in Oldham County for a party. When he got left behind he said he planned to steal a car to get home.\n \n But Johnson says that doesn't explain why Ellis decided to enter his home.\n \n Ellis has a long criminal past, including multiple rape charges. And he's listed on the Kentucky Sex Offender Registry for raping a 15-year-old girl.\n \n Ellis is charged with burglary, robbery, assault, resisting arrest, assaulting a police officer and possession of burglary tools. He is being held in the Oldham County Jail on a $10,000 full security bond. \n \n From July 18, 2009 KIVI channel 6:\n \n \n Boise Police received a call of a man with a gun this afternoon at approximately 1:18 p.m. in the area of Americana and River Streets. As multiple Boise Police units arrived on the scene, they located two men with handguns and de-escalated the situation. \n \n According to BPD spokesman Charles McClure, \"Witnesses tell police that the original suspect, later identified as John Dickey, had stolen personal property from the victim at a nearby homeless shelter. The suspect fled on foot traveling Eastbound on River Street. As the victim chased the suspect on foot, a third man intevened in the chase by producing a handgun and ordering the suspect to stop. The suspect was on the ground and held at gunpoint when the third citizen -- who was also a concealed weapons permit holder and only saw a man with a gun pointing it at someone, intervened and demanded that the other man drop his gun. Officers then arrived on scene and took the suspect into custody.\"\n \n At this time, the original theft suspect -- John W. Dickey, 46 -- has been taken into custody and charged with misdemeanor petit theft. Dickey has no known address.\n \n \n From July 17, 2009 WAFB channel 9:\n \n \n PORT ALLEN, LA (WAFB) - A ten-year-old boy left home alone with his sister used his mother's gun to shoot an intruder in the face, police said.\n \n Late Tuesday, West Baton Rouge Parish sheriff's deputies received a call to a Port Allen apartment complex after several shots rang out from inside one of the apartments. \"You are out here trying to work and for someone to come and do that and invade your home is very hard,\" the children's mother said. She asked to not be identified.\n \n Deputies say Dean Favron and Roderick Porter knocked several times on the apartment door. The two young children, a ten-year-old boy and eight-year-old girl, stood on the other side, terrified. \"He told his sister to be quiet and seconds later, they started kicking on the door and finally kicked the door in,\" said Sheriff Mike Cazes. The two children ran to their mother's bedroom closet. \n \n In a panic, the ten-year-old grabbed his mother's gun for protection. \"He did what I told him to do. I never told him to get the gun, but thank God he did,\" she said. Once the two suspects opened the door, threatening the kids, deputies say the boy fired a bullet into the lip of Roderick Porter. The two men were taken to the hospital by a third suspect, who is a 15-year-old juvenile. Once they got to the hospital, they were later arrested. \"It's just hard. I don't understand why they would do that. I know they have little brothers and sisters and they wouldn't want anyone to break into their house,\" said the mother.\n \n \n From the Houston Chronicle of July 16, 2009\n NW Houston resident fatally shoots intruder\n \n A man was shot and killed in a Spring Branch home this morning in what police believe was a case of self-defense.\n \n Shortly before 7:30 a.m., paramedics received a call that a man was wounded in the 9000 block of Kerrwood, northwest of the intersection of Hammerly and Bingle.\n \n Police on the scene say it appears the dead man was killed trying to rob the modest wood-frame house, which has a visible security camera installed outside.\n \n Neighbors said crime has increased in the area in recent years, mostly break-ins and burglaries.\n \n \"It's disturbing, but there's nothing you can do about it,\" neighbor Terry Vick said, referring to what happened today.\n \n Ginny Evans, who has lived in the area for less than two years, said she was stunned by the shooting.\n \n \"I can't blame him. I'd shoot (an intruder) if he was in my house,\" said Evans, who added that she had given her pistol to a friend but now plans to either ask for it back or buy another one. \n \n \"It's real scary, and it's sad,\" she said.\n \n No arrests have been made and authorities are still on the scene. No other information was immediately available.\n \n From the July 13, 2009 Redding (Cal.) Record-Searchlight:\n \n \n An Anderson man shot and killed a 33-year-old Burney man early Sunday after he allegedly caught him trying to steal property from his Tranquil Lane home, investigators said.\n \n Jerry Kirk called 911 about 3:40 a.m. saying he'd just shot a man in his front yard, Shasta County sheriff's Capt. Dave Compomizzo said.\n \n Curtis Evin Ingalls died from his wounds on the property, Compomizzo said. The home sits behind a gate at the end of a quiet street surrounded by walnut orchards and horse pastures.\n \n Compomizzo declined to say how many times Ingalls had been shot with Kirk's handgun or where he had been hit.\n \n The two men knew each other, Compomizzo said.\n \n Kirk went to confront Ingalls after he caught him trying to take tools and other equipment from the property, Compomizzo said.\n \n \"He didn't assault Kirk, but he went after him,\" Compomizzo said.\n \n No arrests have been made in the case.\n \n Crime scene investigators remained at the property throughout the morning, and investigators continued interviewing witnesses and family members throughout the day, Compomizzo said.\n \n Ingalls has a lengthy criminal history in Shasta County. On Wednesday, he pleaded no contest to obstructing an executive officer, a felony, according to electronic Shasta County Superior Court records.\n \n He was to be sentenced Aug. 5.\n \n In January, Ingalls pleaded no contest to obstructing a police officer and injuring a police dog. He was sentenced to 63 days in Shasta County jail, court records show.",

   "I know of one instance in which gun ownership did attract criminals. It was the Chicago gun buyback program. Kids robbed guns from peoples' houses in order to turn them in for $50 apiece.\n\n \n \n \n [CENTER]Like cash for unwanted gold.\n \n Go to\n A Gold Rush For Gold Thieves?\n Jewelry has always been a favorite target of thieves, but Target 11 discovered that it may be even more so now that burglars have found a new way to get rid of the jewelry.\n \n Target 11 began investigating after receiving a call from a North Side woman who was the victim of a burglary. She said the thieves only took gold jewelry.\n \n She began contacting Internet gold companies and discovered that many had no way of identifying stolen jewelry.\n \n Target 11 also contacted a host of mail-in companies and discovered that some of them require customers to sign a waiver and provide identification, but most need only a name and an address. That's it. There are relatively few questions asked. Even police admitted it's an easy out for burglars.\n \n \"There's really no law or ordinance as far as I know that we can enforce what they're selling or buying or make them report to us so that would be a loophole in the system, \" said Pittsburgh police Sgt. Kevin Gasiorowski.\n \n While those mail-in companies appear to operate with little restriction, it's a much different story for gold dealers in the city of Pittsburgh. Eddie Lowy owns Banner Coin Exchange. Under the law, he's required to log every transaction, notify police and hold the jewelry for 30 days. Lowy said he supports the restrictions and he believes the restrictions should apply to all companies, even the Internet mail-in operations.\n \n \"I'm saying that for the evil element out there, this has been a boom for them,\" said Eddie Lowy.\n \n The problem was such a concern in one state that it prompted lawmakers to take action. Florida passed legislation requiring mail-in companies to follow strict guidelines. The companies must notify police of the transactions, photograph the jewelry and create a database for police to view the items. The companies are also required to hold the jewelry for 10 days before melting it.\n \n \"The same thing happened with copper. When the copper was high, we had a spike in copper-related burglaries. Now that copper is low, we don't see as many.

It is completely legal and authorized BY LAW.\n \n Many defensive gun uses are never reported to police because there is no crime. Oft times just the appearance of a gun is enough to make a perp stop and not complete his criminal act. Also, the news media doesn't like reporting defensive use by citizens. They would rather report sensational stories of blood and guts, ie. murders by felons. The same methology is never used to report crime vs. non criminal gun use. Just as the links I posted yesterday, even though a gun was used to hold the criminal and/or was not reported by the news media. Even in the Colorado shooting which was stopped by a citizen who happened to be an ex-cop, they reported that \"an off duty officer stopped the shooter\".\n \n You got to get a handle on yourself.

Oh you mean the guy who pretended to be a woman for three years in a desperate attempt to rescue his credibility after other scholars accused him of fabricating statistics?\n Who is Mary Rosh? John Lott is Mary Rosh, That's Who.\n\n \n Who is David Hemenway and who is the anti-gun Joyce Foundation that is now withdrawing from the gun controller funding to keep from throwing good money after bad?\n \n In this two page article (bulletin) he quotes himself 6 times, and only mentions others work without quoting any cites only 4 times.\n \n He ignores and dissallows the very definition of self defense which is in imminent fear of death or serious bodily injury BY STATING \"for example, a pre-emptive strike would not be considered a self-defense gun use\". IOW, you have to allow the perp the first shot and/or follow up shots which would make his illogic more apt. He asks that screeners \"ignore\" negative data and assume that a respondent could not have experienced a true self defense situation.\n \n He also pleads that the 'buyer' reject the first estimate which is 2.5 million in favor of a lower estimate which is still over TWO TIMES as many defense instances as there are TOTAL DEATHS involving guns for any type of death by gun. This is an old update in 2000 regurgitated yet again, third time now, second was in 2000, and funded by the anti-gun Joyce Foundation.\n \n His reasoning is much like a worse hypothesis than by Kellerman who only counted dead bodies and suppositions. Hemenway would have us accept that if an armed perp was killed before firing a shot then it could not have been self defense from a \"pre-emptive act\" of a person being so uncouth as to shoot the criminal without giving them the first shots. He also asks that self defense from wild animals not be included. \n \n He goes on to the point of complete inanity by pressing his theory that \"most self-defense cases rely on judgement and could be considered criminal acts\". This cuts against the laws that govern self-defense and appropriate and lawful acts in the penal codes so I guess he doesn't accept those laws either. (that is a statement and not a question)\n \n His conclusion is not unlike Bellesiles, SSRN-Fall from Grace: Arming America and the Bellesiles Scandal by James Lindgren\n \n Hemenway concludes that people who defend themselves do so in a criminal way and even so the number of criminal uses still outnumber defensive gun use. He supposes that even 2.5 million DGUs are somehow less than the number of criminal uses reported by the BJS and FBI. Hemenway concluded in III that there was no way to measure \"gun intimidations\" as they may not have been reported as a crime.\n \n By doing so, he completely ignores the fact that many use of force applications such as penal code admissable threat of force be ignored because they might be: socially undesirable, and many might inappropriately be missed by Approach 2 (e.g., many gun intimidations may not be reported as crimes). \n \n By contrast it appears that the large majority of the self-defense gun uses reported using Approach 1 are socially undesirable; they are largely escalating arguments, or preemptive gun use out of fear rather than \n a response to an attempted crime. Most would appropriately be missed by Approach 2, and should not be considered genuine self-defense gun uses.\n 5\n They are actually reports of inappropriate or criminal gun \n use. :xcensored\n \n Mostly he requires his readers to ignore the law and accept his suppositions which are untentable, unexcusable and unacceptable! ...and that is who Hemenway is!",

My expose of Hemenway, which star gazer chose to emulate when he posted Hemenway's thesis and attempted to defend it as logical, failed miserably but you chose to be the standard bearer and berate us with unlawful demands by the author. I have taken the time to assess his faults, misconceptions, massaging of statistics and misrepresentation of the very essence of self defense which he demands you agree with to make a horse apple more palatable. It is no more palatable with your weak defense than it was previously since 1996. You can't defend those stats of Hemenway because he chooses not to accept the legal definition of self defense but makes all sorts of claims about why the reader should dismiss them with a lame accusation that some may be criminal or pre-intervention. The ignorance is that the legislatures have adopted the Castle Law which is a legal stance to clarify, not change what already existed, their intent and state that the criminal cannot file charges, torts, and complete the crime by punishing the property owner or one in defense of his life, property or a third person. Criminals are getting shot and you don't appear to like your odds. Now why would that be? emoticon_smile",

Never has been and if you go back through my posts you will find I am a staunch advocate of it because the police have no duty to protect you.\n \n What is not counted is the many times a firearm is used to deter or prevent crime when nary a shot was fired. These actions are the ones decried by the study author who claims they are criminal acts when they are not. This data you presented doesn't take into account legal gun owners charged with a crime but never convicted. I am certain there are far more to justifiable self defense than merely a dead body and the Penal Code make it clear when a person is justified in those acts. Hemenway sets his own standards which I discuss at length and show why his \"survey\" is faulty and also Dr. Lindgren's notation of those faults.\n \n Methology of dead body count is a poor indicator of the deterrance factor and about as accurate as counting bodies shot by police and disregarding arrests and imprisonment.\n \n I freely admit you found something that is new to me but then it never was my point, it was yours and the damand that I find evidence to support your claim which although interesting does not carry much weight in the topic posed by star gazer nor Hemenway.

You might try Cook and Ludwigs studies also.\n \n The point you are bent on making is that there are far more criminal uses by criminals than by armed citizens. Well, that won't cut it. We have over 98,000 death by doctor and medical mistakes so why do we tolerate that? Simply because it saves more lives than it takes. You can argue survey all you want until the cows come home and keep spinning your wheels.\n \n I showed you the futility of the \"legally justified shootings by citizens. That does not count those charged with a crime and later are justified in court. A citizen does not get the free pass a police officer does. One thing you may not know about most prosecutors is they have a lot of power and let their personal belief and politics enter into their actions. This alone has cause gun owners a lot of grief...for nothing because they can always claim they were just doing their job.\n \n I explained to you and warned you about using dead bodies as an accurate glimpse of the effect of ccw laws and those who exercise them. Remember Kellerman? Your claim that more people reported guns used as a crime instead of self-defense is a non starter. You have no idea how many use a gun without the dead body to deter criminal acts and no one will deny that most of these are never reported because no crime was committed, the gun prevented it/crime.\n \n Wowee, the police only justifiably killed about 100 more so that means the police aren't doing their job by your estimation? We got another thread going where cops are shooting kids over real looking guns. Where was the dead at Ruby Ridge, Waco, Oklahoma City counted? As homocides even though probably killed by cops just as Randy Weaver's dog, wife, and kid was. Justifiable huh?\n \n Don't be so eager to take those stats so stated as the definitive word. I personally don't think they were added until the Heller case about 3 years ago now.\n \n Cook and Ludwig, not gun affeciandos, thought John Lott's figures were a little high, check it out and see what they found. Judging from the FBI STATS, that would amount to about 4-5 per State. We did much better here in Texas :) There are other surveys out also that you might not like as much as the ones you chose but don't let that slow you down none.

   "Doc...\n \n Try reading my links. Cook and Ludwig is the 'second attempt' that is linked to in my above post. As for Lindgren - link me a second time? I have searched, and I cannot find - both on this forum, and beyond. In fact, one of the first hits I got then googleing 'Lindgren DGU' was this page which goes against some of the claims made by Lott in 'More guns, less crime, rather than supporting it.\n \n Your attempts to read extra details into my post are misguided, not to mention inaccurate. The statistics given just support the position given in my above post (that there is more gun crime than gun usage), in the way that is described in the post. I am not implying anything else from those stats, be it about the effectiveness of the police, how the 'justified homicides' are some indication of DGU rates, or anything else.\n \n You mention that doctors are 'tolerated' because they save more lives than they end. This simply backs up my argument - if more lives are ended by guns than are saved, why tolerate them? As we have no way of telling how many lives were saved (NATO), we can rephrase this - if more crimes happen because of guns than are prevented by them, why tolerate them?\n \n Finally, you return to the same position that NATO and many others have returned to before when met by this argument - 'I don't care if it turns out that guns cause more crime overall, it's my right to have one!'. For that argument, it's your turn to read back through this thread - Bryan remains the only person who has responded to that linked post of mine (to avoid hypocrisy, that post is here).

That survey, too, provided some more reasons why the number might have been artificially inflated to such a high figure.\n Perhaps the inflation is not on the DGU end. Or would that be deflation?\n Finally comes the survey mentioned in the start of this thread, which (as far as I can see) was never really debunked. Using identical methods of questioning, more people claimed to have been the victim of gun crime than been the defender with a gun.\n \n \n\n \n Well perhaps you should look a little closer when you have the time and are not on the fly. The point you miss or conviently over look is that there are DGUs here. Now that alone should be enough to give pause to the slavery crowd. That it doesn't shows a callous disregard for innocent life in pursuit of an insidious agenda. I for one am leery of any survey done by supposed health care people. Now if they were criminologists I would put more credence to their writings. \n \n \"Civilian firearm ownership in the United States carries with it the cost of\n criminal violence.\" When your introduction contains this, one need read no further. Even in your country there is criminal violence, gun violence even. So to suggest that ownership of any thing carries a cost of criminal violence is nonsense from the start. \n \n \"The National Crime Victimization Survey is a multistage probability sample\n of 59000 housing units in the United States.

   "Doc...\n \n Try reading my links. Cook and Ludwig is the 'second attempt' that is linked to in my above post. As for Lindgren - link me a second time? I have searched, and I cannot find - both on this forum, and beyond. In fact, one of the first hits I got then googleing 'Lindgren DGU' was this page which goes against some of the claims made by Lott in 'More guns, less crime, rather than supporting it.\n\n \n I had it open when I posted earlier. It is a pay per view site anyway but I can't find it now. My puter erases all history and cookies on shutdown and frankly I am too tired to search for it again.\n \n \nYour attempts to read extra details into my post are misguided, not to mention inaccurate. The statistics given just support the position given in my above post (that there is more gun crime than gun usage), in the way that is described in the post. I am not implying anything else from those stats, be it about the effectiveness of the police, how the 'justified homicides' are some indication of DGU rates, or anything else.\n\n \n I am not posting for your benefit alone Ian, there are lots of others who read these posts and I post mostly for their benefit so there will not be misunderstandings. Answering simple question may be sufficient for you but not to some who are not familiar with the history and subject matter.\n \n \nYou mention that doctors are 'tolerated' because they save more lives than they end. This simply backs up my argument - if more lives are ended by guns than are saved, why tolerate them? As we have no way of telling how many lives were saved (NATO), we can rephrase this - if more crimes happen because of guns than are prevented by them, why tolerate them?\n\n \n Framing an answer in a statement like that is misleading. We know the criminal homicide rate when adjusted for suicide and other causes it winds up as only about 800 deaths of non criminal gang bangers, dope dealers etc. that are truely lamentable. Guns save lives too. You cannot go by body count because dgu is a means to say the criminal was thwarted and no crime took place. I suggest NATO is close to right when he mentions the number of guns. I know in Texas, our crime rate dropped 17% the first year. Florida had a similar experience. Rossi and Wright did a prison survey and found almost 3/4ths of the criminals feared citizens with guns more than the cops. I think that is very meaningful!\n \n \nFinally, you return to the same position that NATO and many others have returned to before when met by this argument - 'I don't care if it turns out that guns cause more crime overall, it's my right to have one!'. For that argument, it's your turn to read back through this thread - Bryan remains the only person who has responded to that linked post of mine (to avoid hypocrisy, that post is here). I regret that I had to stop posting for a while just after he posted - if I find the time, I will respond to his post separately, as it was an interesting (and balanced!) one.\n.\n \n Bryan is like most of us, he will not surrender any right including the 2A! He will probably respond if you reply to his post. I didn't bother to reply to your post because Bryan did and you never responded. I would have said about the same thing but probably not as well :)\n \n If you start giving up your rights, you will wind up working for those who do. Probably for free. Learn to say \"yes massa\".\n \n \"There exists a law, not written down anywhere, but in our hearts.... I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots, or violence, or armed robbers, or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right.\"-Cicero (106-43 BC) \n \n Being from where you are that should have a familiar ring? Is there nothing so sacred you would not die protecting? I feel your shame but I do not feel guilty because that was your choice. I made my choice before the GCA of '68 and have been a vigorous defender of all my rights especially the Second Amendment for if you give up your right to arms all is lost! Governments stand in awe of armed citizens where I trust it shall always remain...do you know who said that?",

They are usually not charged with murder as the self defense is considered justifiable. But they are often charged with illegally carrying a weapon. (A felony in it's own) Isn't this a wonderful result of gun laws? (As I remark in my earlier post) There are only two options for those in Illinois who are victims of a violent assault: Die, or break the law. Either that or do what the Illinois State Police web site recommends for rape victims: Puke on yourself. (Think I'm kidding? See here!: Sexual Assault - If You Are Confronted...)\n \n Notice that using a firearm is NOT considered an option. (Although, guess what the police choose to protect themselves? Don't see too many Illinois State Troopers with barf on their shirts, do you?)\n \n However, it seems very funny that one can perform a lawful act with an item that is illegal to carry in the first place. Therefore, the very gun laws that are passed make it impossible for a lawful citizen to to defend themselves with a firearm without being carted off to jail.\n \n One must be a criminal to do so in Illinois. You have to have a gun to use it for defense.....the mere act of having it makes one a felon there. Therefore....\n \n Only criminals can participate in \"justifiable homicide\" there. The effect is that the OP remarks upon a self-fulfilling condition. The OP points out that more criminals consider their shootings self-defense than the law abiding...\n \n .... Of course \"criminal gun use\" is more prevalent in Illinois. There are no \"justifiable homicides\" by anyone legally carrying a firearm because nobody can legally carry a firearm there. All justifiable homicides can only be performed by those who break the law (illegally carry a gun) therefore \"criminal gun use\".\n \n That's why I stay here in Missouri where I can use the same means the police do....a lawfully, and responsibly carried firearm, to provide for my self-defense.\n \n Yet, this also leads to a lower statistic of \"justifiable homicides\" as the crime rate here is lower than that of Illinois. Funny, the \"evil\" guns that cause so much crime aren't really needed here because the crime is lower.

The fatality rate of violent crime is about 1 in 300 so even if we were to assume that that study is correct and that defensive gun uses were 100% effective in stopping a violent crime that would be 7,500 lives saved (1/300 * 2.5 million = 7,500).

This is an overestimate since it assumes that guns are 100% effective and that all of the 80,000 crimes that guns were used to defend against were assaults when in fact some were robberies and burglaries (which have lower fatality rates than assaults).

   "Gun laws are getting looser across much of U.S.\n \n By ERIK SCHELZIG\n \n Associated Press Writer\n \n NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - It's been the year of the gun in Tennessee. In a flurry of legislative action, handgun owners won the right to take their weapons onto sports fields and playgrounds and, at least briefly, into bars.\n \n A change in leadership at the state Capitol helped open the doors to the gun-related bills and put Tennessee at the forefront of a largely unnoticed trend: In much of the country, it is getting easier to carry guns.\n \n A nationwide review by The Associated Press found that over the last two years, 24 states, mostly in the South and West, have passed 47 new laws loosening gun restrictions.\n \n Among other things, legislatures have allowed firearms to be carried in cars, made it illegal to ask job candidates whether they own a gun, and expanded agreements that make permits to carry handguns in one state valid in another.\n \n The trend is attributed in large part to a push by the National Rifle Association. The NRA, which for years has blocked attempts in Washington to tighten firearms laws, has ramped up its efforts at the state level to chip away at gun restrictions.\n \n \"This is all a coordinated approach to respect that human, God-given right of self defense by law-abiding Americans,\" says Chris W. Cox, the NRA's chief lobbyist. \"We'll rest when all 50 states allow and respect the right of law-abiding people to defend themselves from criminal attack.\"\n \n Among the recent gun-friendly laws:\n \n - Arizona, Florida, Louisiana and Utah have made it illegal for businesses to bar their employees from storing guns in cars parked on company lots.\n \n - Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, South Carolina and Virginia have made some or all handgun permit information confidential.\n \n - Montana, Arizona and Kansas have allowed handgun permits to be issued to people who have had their felony convictions expunged or their full civil rights restored.\n \n - Tennessee and Montana have passed laws that exempt weapons made and owned in-state from federal restrictions. Tennessee is the home to Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, the maker of a .50-caliber shoulder-fired rifle that the company says can shoot bullets up to five miles and is banned in California.\n \n The AP compiled the data on new laws from groups ranging from the Legal Community Against Violence, which advocates gun control, to the NRA.\n \n Public attitudes toward gun control have shifted strongly over the past 50 years, according to Gallup polling. In 1959, 60 percent of respondents said they favored a ban on handguns except for \"police and other authorized persons.\" Gallup's most recent annual crime survey in October found 71 percent opposed such a ban.\n \n The NRA boasts that almost all states grant handgun permits to people with clean criminal and psychological records. In 1987, only 10 states did. Only Wisconsin, Illinois and the District of Columbia now prohibit the practice entirely.\n \n \"The NRA has a stranglehold on a lot of state legislatures,\" said Kristin Rand, legislative director the Violence Policy Center, a gun control group in Washington. \"They basically have convinced lawmakers they can cost them their seats, even though there's no real evidence to back that up.\"\n \n Tennessee's new laws came after the Republican takeover of the General Assembly this year, but most other states that loosened restrictions didn't experience major partisan shifts. Most of the states where the new laws were enacted have large rural populations, where support for gun rights tends to cross party lines.\n \n While some states have tightened gun laws during the same period, the list of new restrictive laws is much shorter. In 2009 alone, more than three times as many laws were passed to make it easier on gun owners.\n \n New Jersey's 2009 law limiting people to one handgun purchase per month is the most notable of the more restrictive laws. Other examples this year include Maryland's ban on concealed weapons on public transit and Maine's vote to give public universities and colleges the power to regulate firearms on campus.\n \n The most contentious of Tennessee's new gun laws was one allowing handguns in bars and restaurants that serve alcohol. It took effect in July after lawmakers overrode a veto by the governor. Last month, a Nashville judge struck down the law as unconstitutionally vague, but supporters have vowed to pass it again.\n \n A similar Arizona law that took effect in September allows people with concealed-weapons permits to bring their guns into bars and restaurants that haven't posted signs banning them.\n \n While Tennessee's law was in place, many bars chose not to let customers bring guns in. Likewise, more than 70 communities have opted out of allowing guns in parks.\n \n \"People go in there and start drinking and then they want to start a fight. What are they going to do if they got a gun in their hand?\" said Larry Speck, 69, who works at an auto repair shop in Memphis. \"I've got a gun permit and I'm not carrying mine in there even if they have a law.\"\n \n Chattanooga retiree Ken Hasse, 71, said he worries about the possible consequences of allowing people to carry their guns in places like parks. \"It's going to tempt somebody to use one,\" he said.\n \n Supporters of expanding handgun rights argue that people with state-issued permits are far less likely to commit crimes, and that more lawfully armed people cause a reduction in crime. Opponents fear that more guns could lead to more crime.\n \n Academics are divided on the effects of liberalized handgun laws, and determining the impact is complicated by the move in several states to close handgun permit records.\n \n A Violence Policy Center project has mined news reports to find that more than 100 people have been killed by holders of handgun-carry permits since 2007, including nine law enforcement officers. The project originally intended to list all gun crimes by permit holders, but there were too many to keep track of, Rand said.\n \n \"They shoot each other over parking spaces, at football games and at family events,\" Rand said. \"The idea that you're making any place safer by injecting more guns is just completely contradicted by the facts.\"\n \n The flood of legislative victories in Tennessee after many years of frustration now has some gun backers aiming for a whole new level of freedom: No permits at all.\n \n The permit laws \"are an extra burden on people to exercise essentially a constitutional right,\" said John Harris, executive director of the Tennessee Firearms Association.\n \n The Daily Citizen, Dalton, GA - Gun laws are getting looser across much of U.S.\n Even tho they did include the lies and drivel from VPC it is impressive.",

I have already presented evidence to support my claims about this matter.\n\n \n You had oooooodles of proof in the first 5 pages. Did you miss this one? From Doctors for integrety of policy research.\n Firearms in America: The Facts\n \n posted in full for educational and scholarship values: IOW for those who do not know how to read links.\n \n \nFirearms in America: The Facts \n Martin L. Fackler, MD\n Monday, Dec. 25, 2000 \n I must confess to being a member of a very dangerous group. I am a physician: We cause more than 100,000 deaths per year in the USA by mistakes and various degrees of carelessness in treating our patients. Why does society tolerate us? \n Because we save far more patients than we kill. Firearms are entirely analogous. Although used in far fewer deaths* - they are used to prevent about 75 crimes for each death. Firearms, like physicians, prevent far more deaths than they cause. (Gary Kleck, \"Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America,\" Hawthorne, N.Y., Aldine de Gruyter Publisher, 1991)\n \n Consider the implications of the fact that firearms save many more lives than they take. That means decreasing the number of firearms would actually cause an increase in violent crime and deaths from firearms. \n \n This inverse relationship between the number of firearms in the hands of the public and the amount of violent crime has, in fact, been proven beyond any reasonable doubt. (John R. Lott Jr., \"More Guns Less Crime,\" University of Chicago Press, 1998)\n \n History supports the inverse firearm-crime relationship. In \"Firearms Control - A Study of Armed Crime and Firearms Control\" in England and Wales (London, Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1972, p. 243), Chief Inspector Colin Greenwood found that:\n \n No matter how one approaches the figures, one is forced to the rather startling conclusion that the use of firearms in crime was very much less when there were no controls of any sort. ... Half a century of strict controls on pistols has ended, perversely, with a far greater use of this class of weapons in crime than ever before.\n \n In Tasmania, Australia, on 28 April 1996, a lone gunman killed 35 and wounded 21 at the Port Arthur Historic Site. The Australian legislature reacted by outlawing self-loading rifles and pump as well as self-loading shotguns. One year after the massive confiscation of guns the effects of this action became clear. Every category of violent crime had increased; the most striking was a 300 percent increase in assaults against the elderly.\n \n Those demented persons who have expressed their frustration by a shooting spree have apparently retained enough good sense to choose places where those shot would almost certainly be unarmed: a schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., the Columbine High School, a Jewish day care center in Los Angeles, a Long Island Rail Road car (due to the highly restrictive ban on handgun carry permits in New York). \n \n The emotional reaction to these incidents, attempting to make certain places \"gun free\" zones, for example, revealed a striking lack of rational thought. Apparently those pushing for \"gun free\" zones failed to recognize that the perpetrators of these incidents chose their sites specifically because they were already essentially \"gun free\" areas - practically guaranteeing no armed resistance to foil their plans. \n \n Such gun-restrictive proposals are a certain recipe for making the situation worse. Lott's studies have shown that such mass shootings essentially disappear in states that pass laws allowing qualified citizens to carry concealed handguns (The American Enterprise, July-August, 1998).\n \n Consider the steadily decreasing rate of violent crime over the past eight years. An article in USA Today (K Johnson, 9 Oct 00, 3A) reported \"Gun injuries in crimes fall 40% in 5 years.\" This stark decline has occurred concomitantly with a constant rise in the number of firearms in the hands of the American public. \n \n This strongly supports the \"more guns less crime\" relationship verified by Kleck, Lott, history, and common sense. This steady decrease has brought the current percentage of gun violence in the USA to its lowest rate in the past three to four decades. One would expect the anti-gun groups to be pleased and to moderate their goals. \n \n Instead, apparently rankled by the facts proving their theories dead wrong, they are promoting increasingly prohibitive gun laws with ever-increasing zeal. Could it be that the media attention bestowed upon their cause has become addictive? Certainly, legislators have found the free TV time given to their anti-gun tirades something they cannot live without.\n \n I suggest that a reason for the decreasing crime rate, caused in part by the increasing number of guns, lies, perversely and ironically, in the counterproductive exaggerations and incessant repetitions, by the TV media, of each and every bloody shooting they can find. \n \n This has frightened and misled the public into believing the threat from guns is ever increasing, rather than decreasing sharply, and has whetted their appetites for firearms to defend themselves. Thus the public has bought more firearms - which has further decreased the violence from firearms.\n \n There is a perception among gun owners that they are being treated irrationally as legislators pander to the misinformed majority who are being swayed by emotional appeals that fly in the face of the studies cited above, history, and basic common sense. They feel that legislators should be obliged to soberly consider the facts and not have their votes dictated by blind, unthinking, and most often counterproductive, emotion.\n \n Consider firearm registration: being increasingly promoted by nearly all anti-gun groups - and politicians. These promoters neglect to explain why or how they expect firearm registration to prevent future violence; especially since, historically, such restrictive laws have always proven ineffective or counterproductive - most often causing a marked increase in violent crime, as shown in the examples given above. We already know how honest, formerly law-abiding, citizens will react to irrational laws requiring them to register their firearms. \n \n California has taught us. After Purdy's shooting spree on the Stockton schoolyard in 1989, the Californian legislature passed a law requiring the registration of all \"assault rifles.\" In the emotional frenzy following that shooting incident, everybody expected legislators to pass such a restrictive law. \n \n What happened? The price of \"assault rifles\" tripled in California. Many tens of thousands of these rifles poured into California before the law went into effect. Then came the time for registration. Very few \"assault rifle\" owners chose to obey the law. \n \n It is uncertain how many criminals were created by this irrational law, but most estimate that fewer than 10 percent of the \"assault rifles\" in California were registered. If an estimated several hundred thousand \"assault rifle\" owners in California chose to become criminals rather than obey an irrational law, how many gun owners nationwide can we expect to do the same if required to register their guns? \n \n Most of the facts explained above are unknown to the majority of the American public. The pro-gun political activists spend so much time harping on the Second Amendment that they tend to overlook the factual proof that decreasing the number of guns increases violence, and vice-versa. \n \n Additionally, I believe that most Americans consider their right to protect themselves and their families a far more fundamental right than the Second Amendment.\n \n Many honest gun owners are now frightened. They have every reason to be. Few of the facts outlined above have been revealed by a media that, instead, gives full play to the emotionally based appeals and flagrant exaggerations of the anti-gun groups. \n \n These gun owners fear that they will be forced into a difficult moral decision: Do they obey a law requiring them to register their firearms, when they are fully aware of the irrationality and counterproductive nature of such a law? Or are they morally obligated to disobey such an unjust law - and thus become a criminal? Our forefathers faced a similar moral dilemma. Had most of them chosen to obey, we would still be a colony of England.\n \n We must separate, dispassionately, the clearly established facts about firearms in the USA from emotionally based opinions, exaggerations, and falsehoods. No rational approach to any problem is possible until this is done. \n \n I worry that irrational restrictive measures, such as mandated gun registration, will result in a massive backlash of civil disobedience - not by drug-dazed teenagers, but by sober, honest, and mature adults who are well-armed and proficient in the use of their weapons. That could tear this country apart.\n \n *Footnote. When anti-gun activists list the number of deaths per year from firearms, they neglect to mention that 60 percent of the 30,000 figure they often use are suicides. They also fail to mention that at least three-quarters of the 12,000 homicides are criminals killing other criminals in disputes over illicit drugs, or police shooting criminals engaged in felonies. Subtracting those, we are left with no more than 3,000 deaths that I think most would consider truly lamentable.\n \n \n Dr. Martin Fackler is America's most foremost forensic expert on ballistic injuries.\n",

Used to visit a US Marshall I got acquainted with at pistol matches, one of those things that just kinda click when equals meet and your conversations are agreeable to both. One morning I went with a friend to a town about 200 miles away where he lived; the friend had to get his chemical applicator renewal. We talked through 5 pitchers of coffee until about 5 pm non stop. When my friend came out and we realized how long we had visited, that he needed to get home for supper and we needed to eat also he said: \"you know this is the most relaxed I have been in my entire life, most people want to hear stories about my career and about shooting and such and you never mentioned anything job related.\" No doubt he understood I had stories of my own. People that do, don't. People that don't imagine all sorts of stuff, like you do. I doubt that you would be comfortable around me at all? I certainly would not try to entertain you with something you wouldn't and could not understand and the big question would be why would I want to share a personal tragedy with someone who wouldn't understand and with someone who would understand is understood at the handshake. Why do you suppose what you claim? You have no basis of understanding nor does anyone have any desire to tell you personal stories to entertain you or impress you. Now Sarge and I would get along just fine but I doubt he would mention nor volunteer personal experiences nor would I.\n \n \nPerhaps, but highly speculative on your part.\n\n \n No, personal experience strictly from volunteers in a learning situation to promote more learning from situational awareness. \n \n \nA number of my friends and family keep firearms.\n\n \n ok. \n \n \nI would not allow my kids in households with firearms if I suspected that the firearms were not properly secured.\n\n \n So how are you gonna know?

Depending on which research you believe, the number of defensive gun uses ranges from 83,000 per year to 3.6 million. The 83,000 comes from the US DOJ and is flawed because it only counts reported instances of defensive uses. Other numbers are dubious as well, but I'll let Tim tell you all about the problems with Lott. \n \n SayUncle >> More gun stats debunked\n Now that is a small part of the beating.

There seems to be a gross attempt at propaganda to assume or attempt to pretend that folks exercising their self defense/2A rights do so for the joy of killing when nothing could be farther from the truth. People shoot bad people because they value their lives and their families lives more than some demented perp..they shoot to live!\n \n That alone gets boring as most propaganda does and has long ago lost any shock value, sensational value in an attempt to demonize folks who are obeying the highest law of the land and of Nature itself. Nothing turns me off like some of the comments on these boards and the demands that there must be dead bodies to count and explicitly shows beyond reasonable doubt that most citizens who exercise self-defense are reluctant to take a life when they risk theirs by not doing so. We shoot to live, not for a body count. In most jurisdictions, it is frowned on and illegal to fire \"a warning shot\". We are taught to shoot center of mass because that is the best place to stop and the easiest to hit under stress, bad lighting, and rushing adrenalin. Critics would have one ignore this and like Kellerman attempt to use a body count which, as Shakespeare said, \"full of sound and fury, signifying nothing\".",

   "This entire discussion topic was merely an attempt by star gazer to attempt to prove Kellerman's unvetted, non peer reviewed attempted hatchet job on behalf of the gun grabbers. It failed miserably and now he tries to ressurect the thesis he should have posted now at the beginning instead of the dishonest claims he has made to avoid the thesis and concentrate on the object of Kellerman's destroyed study that was reproduced from 1986 and slightly re-done in the early 1990s. The deceit didn't work huh star gazer? :)\n \n Anyone, and I think of sinjin, can attempt to claim they felt \"threatened by a gun\" even if they found out hours later that the shopkeeper who offed a perp at the store they bought candy for the kids from. Yeah, that's right, we get interviews on the boob tube all the time where a shooting took place and neighbors blocks away claim to feel 'threatened' because it/the scene, was only blocks from their house.\n \n This kind of stuff gets put down by folks like Kellerman as when the question is asked, \"have you ever been threatened by a gun\"? That is a positive response so it is included in their \"poll\" and goes down as \"proof\" that guns are used more in criminal use than in self-defense...ie. one shopkeeper, one shot perp and 15 willing to \"feel threatened\". Same ploy gets used in a bus crash, some folks rush to jump on the wreck and claim they were passengers who were injured on the bus. This is the kind of junk folks who pose as researchers like to pose as \"proof\" of their thesis.\n \n Say, any of you anti-constitutionalist want to buy some ocean front property in Arizona?

Langan, Ph.D., BJS Statistician and David P. Farrington, Ph.D., BJS\n Visiting Fellow, University of Cambridge (Adobe Acrobat PDF file)\n\n \n Good ones Sarge. Cook and Ludwig thought Lott was a little low in his findings.\n \n OTOH, current history doesn't reflect well on Kellerman's \"work\".\n \n Kellerman Debunked!\n \n \nKellerman used many statistical tricks such as limiting any defensive gun use to that where the trigger was actually pulled and excluding any gun use which ocurreding any gun use which ocurred outside the home (such as the front yard). Using multiple categories and then condensingg the data from there tended to obscure the more obvious factors such as, most suicides in his study did not use a gun. And he also refused to allow criminologists such as Kates and Kleck to examine his \"data.\" Too many to mention here. \n \n Despite the 1986 \"study\" being trashed by every major criminologist, the \"43 times\" soundbite that emerged lives on in news stories and HCI literature. The 1986 \"study\" is actually kind of boring and tacky when compared to Kellerman\"s 1993 NEJM submission Again, without a hint of peer-review (since the peers didn't get a chance to look at the data until May of 1997), Kellerman this time has not only one co-author, but nine!! Five MDs, three PhDs and one BA in total, not a recognizable name from the world of criminology among them. \n \n Oh, and Kellerman was now one of the major recipients of over two million in grants from the CDC. The CDC head that gave Kellerman the money and helped him hide his data from the probing eyes of scholarly criminologists, thus violating federal law, is now President Clinton's pick for Surgeon General. Anyway, the soundbite that comes from the 1993 \"study\"? \"A gun in the home is 2.7 times...\" \n \n On purpose. Kellerman\"s first \"mistake\" is building his is building his paper around a \"case-control model.\" A CCM does well when used to from a general hypothesis about, say, what is causing a particular disease outbreak. But it has a problem with being very sensitive to sample errors and it played right into Kellerman\"s hands. \n \n Kellerman took homicide data from three different counties from August 1987 to August 1992. These counties surrounded Seattle (co-author and medical examiner, Donald Reay\"s jurisdiction), Memphis and Cleveland. He then investigated each homicide case to see what lifestyle factors it had (drug-use, renting/owning). The proper thing to do would have been to use a random sample of people who may, or may not have been involved in a homicide. Having found the \"case\", Kellerman now finds a \"control\" nearby who supposedly shared the demographics but did not have a homicide in the household. \n \n Here is where everything goes to hell in a handbasket. First, Kellerman was only able to get 388 valid cases out of 1860 official reports but only 316 matched controls. Such a small sample is prone to wide statistical variations absent an agenda such as Kellerman et al. It would be interesting to see why, exactly, Kellerman decided to drop so many cases from the study--but none of the analyses that I have read were writtenread were written after 1996. Again, homicides whether lawful or not are included along with suicides. And even \"police\" was listed as a category in the \"Offender\" column. \n \n What Kellerman found was that in the homicide homes, 71% of the victims had high rates of criminal activity which agrees with other studies which find that 75% of murderers and 75% of cop killers are adults with long felony histories.. Hardly something that would compare to the rest of America. No, the gun didn't do it. The nature of the criminal did. Criminals killing criminals. \n \n The study never made an effort to decide whether the person being killed was an intruder --OR--whether the gun which may or may not have been present was actually used. And since Kellerman's study shows that 71% of the homicide victims were killed by people whose relationship to the victim indicates that the killer did not live in the victim's house--and presumably brought his own weapon, if any, with him. All Kellerman asked was, \"In this household where a homicide was committed, was there a gun, any gun, in the house?\" Nothing more. \n \n It turns out that the cases did not quite match up with the controls. While the cases had an overwhelming violent history of crime, assault, drug abuse and, drug abuse and domestic violence (real stuff, notthe pushy- shovey type) the controls background check consisted of, \"Were you ever arrested?\" Well, I have been arrested--failure to appear in court for not licensing my dog. Not the same stuff. Also, nothing was asked of convictions or seriousness of the crime. \n \n Kellerman, goes to the control house which must be at least \"one block\" away from the case house, but no maximum is listed. They could have been way far away from the nasty murder neighborhood. Anyone who has traveled through Phoenix can pass by $200,000 homes and stumble right into run-down apartments and nasty trailer parks in a heartbeat. \n \n So Kellerman comes up with what he calls a \"risk ratio\" or \"relative risk\" which is actually just a statistical \"odds ratio\". Kellerman uses the term \"risk\" to make his pronouncement more terrifying. In logic, this is called an \"equivocation.\" But was does a 2.7 odds ratio mean? An odds ratio of 1.0 denotes a positive risk. Negative 1.0 denotes an opposite association. An odds ratio from 1.1 to 3.0 is shown to mean a \"weak or nonexistent\" association. 3.1 to 8.0 is considered moderate. 8.0-16 is considered strong. And over 16.0 is extremely strong. Kellerman's odds ratiorman's odds ratio of 2.7 then, is meaningless. And his 95% confidence interval measurement of 1.7 to 2.7 shows that his measurement is actually quite good. Tight CI spreads are better. If a CI shifts in one direction, it suggests that the correct number is actually toward that shift. Recall that Kellerman's odds ratio of 43 in his 1986 study was not matched with any CI. Now you know why. :) \n \n So, Kellerman measured odds ratios for other behavioral and environmental factors. I wonder how they aligned with the chance of our criminal buddies getting themselves killed? Let's have a look. The tables might take some adjusting to view properly. \n \n Behavior Odds Ratio Confidence Interval \n \n 1) Victim Drank Alcohol 2.6 1.9-3.5 \n \n 2) Drinking Problems (house) 7.0 4.2-11.8 \n \n 3) Drinking Problems (work) 10.7 4.1-27.5 \n \n 4) Victim Drink Prob (work) 20.0 4.9-82.4 \n \n 5) Housemember drugs 9.0 5.4-15.0 \n \n 6) Victim uses drugs 6.8 3.8-12.0 \n \n 7) Physical fights (drinking) 8.9 5.2-15.3 \n \n 8) Medical attention (fight) 10.2 5.2-20.0 \n \n 9) Any household arrested 4.2 3.0-6.0 \n \n 10 Victim arrested 3.5 2.4-5.2 \n \n ed 3.5 2.4-5.2 \n \n Environmental Factors \n \n 1) Home Rented 5.9 3.8-9.2 \n \n 2) Victim lived along 3.4 2.2-5.1 \n \n 3) Security access 2.3 1.2-4.4 \n \n And now, finally, we get to guns... \n \n 4) Gun(s) in home 1.6 1.2-2.2 \n \n Handgun 1.9 1.4-2.7 \n \n Shotgun 0.7 0.5-1.1 \n \n Rifle 0.8 0.5-1.3 \n \n Did you guys catch the significance of that?

There's an entire upcoming generation to include in defensive gun uses, yet the older generations don't \"retire\" from needing a firearm. There's no set age in which a person will no longer need to defend themselves, yet every day someone will achieve an age in which they are legally able to use a firearm for self defense (and do).",

There seems to be a gross attempt at propaganda to assume or attempt to pretend that folks exercising their self defense/2A rights do so for the joy of killing when nothing could be farther from the truth.

Nothing turns me off like some of the comments on these boards and the demands that there must be dead bodies to count and explicitly shows beyond reasonable doubt that most citizens who exercise self-defense are reluctant to take a life when they risk theirs by not doing so. We shoot to live, not for a body count. In most jurisdictions, it is frowned on and illegal to fire \"a warning shot\". We are taught to shoot center of mass because that is the best place to stop and the easiest to hit under stress, bad lighting, and rushing adrenalin. Critics would have one ignore this and like Kellerman attempt to use a body count which, as Shakespeare said, \"full of sound and fury, signifying nothing\"\n\n \n Heck I don't get this body count thing in relation to DGU and whether or not\n the DGU is 25 or 2.5 mill. annually,its a moot point if your part of the body count,and trust me on this, I don't like moot points.emoticon_xagree",

   "[QUOTE=Doc Jones;383086]This entire discussion topic was merely an attempt by star gazer to attempt to prove Kellerman's unvetted, non peer reviewed attempted hatchet job on behalf of the gun grabbers. It failed miserably and now he tries to ressurect the thesis he should have posted now at the beginning instead of the dishonest claims he has made to avoid the thesis and concentrate on the object of Kellerman's destroyed study that was reproduced from 1986 and slightly re-done in the early 1990s. The deceit didn't work huh star gazer? :)\n \n \nAnyone, and I think of sinjin, can attempt to claim they felt \"threatened by a gun\" even if they found out hours later that the shopkeeper who offed a perp at the store they bought candy for the kids from. Yeah, that's right, we get interviews on the boob tube all the time where a shooting took place and neighbors blocks away claim to feel 'threatened' because it/the scene, was only blocks from their house.\n\n Isn't that like asking the blond why she moved?...and she says she heard that most accidents happen within 5 miles of home.Apology in advance to any natural blonds\n \nThis kind of stuff gets put down by folks like Kellerman as when the question is asked, \"have you ever been threatened by a gun\"? That is a positive response so it is included in their \"poll\" and goes down as \"proof\" that guns are used more in criminal use than in self-defense...ie. one shopkeeper, one shot perp and 15 willing to \"feel threatened\". Same ploy gets used in a bus crash, some folks rush to jump on the wreck and claim they were passengers who were injured on the bus. This is the kind of junk folks who pose as researchers like to pose as \"proof\" of their thesis.\n\n \n \nSay, any of you anti-constitutionalist want to buy some ocean front property in Arizona?

   "Murder down, Gun sales up: Proof that guns don&#8217;t cause crime\n \n \nNo correlation between gun ownership and violent crime\n Murder down, Gun sales up: Proof that guns don't cause crime\n By Second Amendment Foundation Monday, December 21, 2009 \n A ten percent drop in murders during the first six months of this year at a time when gun sales were up dramatically is more proof that there is no correlation between gun ownership and violent crime, the Second Amendment Foundation said today. \n \n The FBI released data Monday that shows murders dropped by 10 percent from the same period in 2008. Meanwhile, according to data released by the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) shows that during the first six months of this year, gun sales were up. January 2009 background checks rose 28.8 percent over the same month in 2008, February's NICS checks were up 23.3 percent and in March they were up 29.9 percent over March 2008. The trend continued in April, with NICS checks up 30.3 percent, while May showed a slowdown, up only 15.5 percent, and in June they were up 18.1 percent.\n \n \"What this shows,\" said SAF Executive Vice President Alan Gottlieb, \"is that gun prohibitionists are all wrong when they argue that more guns result in more crime. Firearms in the hands of law-abiding citizens are no threat to anyone. Perhaps violent criminals were actually discouraged by all of those gun sales earlier this year, because the media made a point of reporting the booming gun market.\n \n \"Anti-gunners,\" he continued, \"have lost another one of their baseless arguments. Millions of Americans bought guns during the first six months of this year, many of them for the first time. Yet with all of those new guns in circulation, coupled with an increased demand for concealed carry licenses around the country, the streets have not been awash in blood, as gun banners repeatedly predict.\n \n \"Hard facts trump hot air,\" Gottlieb concluded. \"These people are consistently wrong about our rights. Millions of people bought guns, especially semiautomatic sport-utility rifles that gun grabbers want to ban because they say people aren't safe with all of those guns in private hands. Well, the people disagree, and so does the data.\"\n",

   "Responses to some of the bogus criticisms often made of Kellermann's studies by gun activists:\n \n 1. \"99.8 percent of the protective uses of guns do not involve homicides,\" says Paul Blackman of the NRA. Defensive gun uses include waving the weapon, firing warning shots, wounding the intruder, etc.\n \n It is simply untrue that researchers cannot measure the nonfatal protective benefits of firearms, or that Kellermann's survey failed to detect such a benefit. If firearms deter, scare away or wound intruders, then the murder victimization rate of gun owners should be lower than non-gun owners. The absence of a gun in the home would have been recognized as a murder risk, rather than the presence of a gun.\n \n Kellermann's case-control method was ideally suited to detect such benefits, if they existed. For example, suppose that guns save 100,000 lives a year, through nonfatal means. Assuming a perfect protection rate, we would see no homicides in households with guns, and 100,000 in households without them. A case-control survey would find the risk associated with guns to be 0.0 -- a perfect benefit. But suppose (more realistically) that guns protect their owners only half the time. There might then be, say, 100,000 homicides in homes with guns and 200,000 in homes without them. A researcher using the case-control method would find that 33 percent of the cases and 50 percent of the controls owned guns, for an odds ratio of .50. Being less than 1, that's a very strong benefit.\n \n Of course, Kellermann's survey found quite the opposite -- a risk 2.7 times greater.\n \n 2. Guns do not emit magic rays that control people's minds, or magnetize murderers to the doorstep.\n \n This strawman argument is based on a false stereotype. Over 76 percent of the homicides were committed by a relative or acquaintance of the victim, and only 3.6 percent were verified as strangers breaking in. Furthermore, arguments and romantic triangles comprised half the homicides. But the most important point here is that a gun in the home only raised the risk of gun homicide -- not homicide by any other means. The most straightforward explanation is that greater gun availability transformed a normal family fight into something much more deadly.\n \n 3. People threatened by violence bought guns to defend themselves, hence the correlation between gun ownership and murder.\n \n This is possible, but the number would only be very small, for the following reasons. The study already controlled for domestic violence, so the only way this could happen is if the murderer threatened the life of the victim before things escalated into violence. The victim would then have to buy a gun, which would fail to protect.\n \n Several things make this unlikely. First, we would expect a history of violence to precede any threats or attempts on a person's life, which is, after all, the ultimate form of violence. Second, the study showed that gun ownership resulted in an increased risk in gun homicides only, not any other type of homicides. Why would the murderer restrict himself to a gun, and then only if the victim had a gun? Third, this makes a poor case for gun deterrence, since the correlation is only possible when the gun fails to protect. Again, the researchers found no protective benefits of gun ownership.\n \n 4. Kellermann's study didn't document whether a firearm used in a particular homicide was the same one kept in the home, or whether it might have been carried in by the murderer.\n \n True, the study doesn't say, but the study's findings make it logically impossible for a significant number of these guns to have been brought in from the outside. The study found that keeping a gun in the house raised the chances of gun homicide only, not any other kind of homicide. It also found that it raised the chances of being killed by a family member or intimate acquaintance, not a stranger or non-intimate acquaintance. We can therefore eliminate the possibility that owning a gun raises the risk of a stranger breaking in (and then only with a gun!). The only alternative is that a family member or intimate acquaintance brought a second gun into the house on the day of the murder (any longer-term storage would have classified it as a \"gun in the house\";) . That all murderers using handguns would do this seems highly implausible. It is also unlikely that these live-in murderers would restrict themselves to guns; we should expect to see other murder methods employed as well. The only plausible conclusion is that the vast majority of the guns used for homicide were the ones kept in the house.\n \n Pro-gun advocates might try a different tack. If an angry spouse has a gun, the other might seek protection by buying a gun also. However, this strategy had to fail for the survey to find a correlation between gun ownership and homicide. This does nothing to rescue the pro-gunner's point that guns protect their owners.\n \n 5. Proxies for the murder victim were not asked if the gun had previously been used for self-defense.\n \n What this objection is asking us to imagine is this: a gun prevents a murder from happening in, say, nine cases. But on the tenth it fails (by necessity, to produce the murder victim in question). If guns really provided this kind of protection, we could easily imagine that one of the previous nine murder attempts would have been successful, had the victim not possessed a gun. In that case, non-gun owners would have seen a higher murder rate. This is something the study would have found (see point 1), but it did not; it found a higher murder rate among gun owners. Pro-gunners might then argue that an individual facing a likely threat sought protection by buying a gun, hence the higher correlation. But this is the same argument rebutted in point 3. Ultimately, the pro-gunners starting assumption is incorrect. Guns do not prevent a series of threats, one of which ultimately succeeds; rather, guns enhance the possibility of murder.\n \n 6. \"These people were highly susceptible to homicide,\" says Paul Blackman of the NRA. \"We know that because they were killed.\"\n \n If there is an Illogic Hall of Shame, this remark deserves to be emblazoned above its front entrance. By this reasoning, we should not put seat belts in cars, because people killed in car crashes were susceptible to those accidents anyway.\n \n What Blackman is doing here is evoking a general risk for murder, while ignoring its specific risk multipliers. You may, in general, have an antagonistic person in your life given to flashes of murderous temper. But there are specific factors that may increase the risk of murder. Does he drink? Use drugs? Commit crime? Own a gun? Increasing any of these behaviors increases the risk. But it makes no sense to increase the risk multiplier, let someone get murdered, and then argue that the multiplier was not at fault, since the victim was obviously susceptible to murder anyway.\n \n This argument also ignores one of the study's findings, that a gun in the home increased the risk of gun homicide only, and not any other method of homicide.\n \n 7. Of course if someone gets shot in their home, there's bound to be a gun in the home. And drowning victims are always found near water.\n \n This is a variation of the Blackman argument above. Water is not the only thing correlated with drowning. There are all the usual risk multipliers, such as a lack of lifeguards, life jackets, warning signs, adult supervision, etc. And notice that this analogy is incorrect. The analogy of guns isn't to water; it's to a lack of lifeguards. The analogy to water is actually murder in general.\n \n 8. The majority of the homicides were not committed by guns, so could not have been committed by Kellermann's scary \"guns in the home.\"\n \n Homes that kept guns experienced an increase in homicides, but this increase was entirely due to gun-related homicides, not homicides by any other method. This objection misses the point.\n \n 9. The researchers did not include in their analysis those cases where the home-owner shot a non-resident intruder.\n \n These cases were rare, but even so, this objection is irrelevant. The protective benefits of a gun would have still shown up in the different victimization rates of gun-owning and gun-less households. (See point 1.)\n \n 10. This study was conducted by medical doctors who were out of their league; this is an issue best left for criminologists.\n \n Epidemiologists are highly experienced at using the case-control method to determine risk factors. This is how cigarette smoking was linked to lung cancer, for example. The statistical method is the same no matter what the risk factor, be it cigarettes, a virus, a missing vitamin or a gun. A good analogy is that of an astronomer using optics technology to make a breakthrough in optometry.\n \n 11. The use of the case-control method allows for spurious associations.\n \n This objection is bogus, since it ignores the role of multivariate analysis.\n \n 12. A disproportionate number of survey respondents were criminals, hence the correlation between gun ownership and murder.\n \n But the survey controlled for criminal backgrounds and domestic violence. The gun/murder correlation was reached after multivariate analysis factored these variables out.\n \n 13. The study was conducted in urban areas, which have high crime. This would promote both gun ownership and death in violent crimes.\n \n But the survey controlled for neighborhoods. The researchers matched the control subjects by neighborhood to the case subjects.\n \n 14. Most of the victims were black, and blacks have a higher murder rate.\n \n Irrelevant. The study controlled for race.\n \n 15. The victims typically had stunningly different lifestyles from the controls: more drinking, crime, drug use, domestic violence, etc.\n \n Again, this objection ignores that multivariate analysis factored out all these variables. The \"2.7 times\" statistic measures gun possession alone (within the limits of the study's 31 variables).\n \n 16. The survey failed to ask about other variables.\n \n The survey asked questions about 31 variables, but in a complex world it's always possible to think up more. Kellermann asked about the most obvious ones; even then, only six retained significance in the final analysis. If there were indeed a \"missing variable,\" it would have to be extremely strong -- and probably extremely obvious as well -- to produce a murder risk of 2.7.\n \n 17. The survey failed to determine the strength of the variables (severity of drug use, domestic violence, crime, etc.)\n \n Indeed, the study asked only \"yes or no\" questions about problems in the home. For example, it asked whether any member of the household had been arrested, without determining the severity of the criminal charge. However, just because the individual questions did not control for severity does not mean the entire study didn't, since it asked a total of 15 questions about behavior, many closely related to each other. But this is really an argument about refining the study's results, not overturning its conclusions, which would be highly unlikely.\n \n 18. The study underestimated the amount of drug use or other domestic problems, which was really the cause of an increased murder risk for gun owners.\n \n Not true. After the researchers controlled for these other risks, the murder risk associated with guns increased, from 1.6 in the univariate analysis to 2.7 in the multivariate analysis. If the study had underestimated the amount of drug use or other domestic problems, then the true risk associated with guns would be even greater.\n \n 19. The number of guns in the control homes were underreported.\n \n If this were true, this would indeed artificially raise the murder risk of having a gun in the home. Conversely, if the number of guns in the case homes were underreported, then this would artificially lower the murder risk associated with guns. But the authors do not believe this was a problem. First, in two of the three counties they studied, they compared their survey results to a pilot study of homes listed as the addresses of owners of registered handguns. The survey respondents' answers were found to be generally valid. Second, the rate of gun ownership by the control respondents in all three counties was comparable to estimates derived by previous social surveys and Cook's gun-prevalence index. (6)\n \n Of course, respondents might not have disclosed possession of illegal guns. Pro-gunners argue that the case subjects were prevented from underreporting the possession of such guns, because murder itself is almost impossible to underreport. (It's difficult to hide either a corpse or a person's absence). And a murder causes the police to search -- and usually find -- the murder weapon, so the truth about gun ownership in the case homes probably came out. However, control subjects have not been investigated by the police for guns, nor do they desire such a search, so they may lie about possessing an illegal gun. The researchers were aware of this possibility, and they assured the respondents that their answers were confidential, and that they could freely refuse to answer any questions. Even so, only a very few respondents refused to answer a question. Ultimately, the possibility of underreporting remains pure speculation at the moment, and further research needs to clarify this question.\n \n Conclusion\n \n The Kellermann study is valid, if incomplete -- as any study must necessarily be. More research needs to be done on other possible variables contributing to the murder rate, although Kellermann has apparently identified the most important ones. The results could be refined by determining the severity of some factors, like criminal background. And it would be good to reconfirm the honesty of the respondents' answers. But the study itself is sound, and gun-control advocates can use it with confidence.\n source",

   "Epidemiologists gather and use statistical data to explain disease conditions in a population.

First, the doctors devised and published epidemiological studies in medical journals, which showed that the problem of gun injuries is large and serious. Then, follow-up studies and articles would quote the earlier studies' conclusions as fact, without ever mentioning the limitations or qualifications on those conclusions. Thus we have the debunked Kellermann study at the top of the pack. \n \n The Kellermann study researchers collected all of the 1,860 official reports of homicides in the three counties. They excluded all homicides that did not occur in the victim's \"home.\" Cases involving the homicide victim under 13 years old were excluded, too. They counted multiple murders and murder-suicides as single homicides to avoid double counting.23 They excluded cases where homeowners killed intruders. So they cherry picked the data.

Accordingly, their \"results may not be generalizable to more rural communities or to Hispanic households.\" \n \n (3) possible \"reverse causation\": some of the association between gun ownership and homicide may have come from the victims having previously \"acquired a gun in response to a specific threat.\" \n \n (4)\"we cannot exclude the possibility that the association we observed is due to a third, unidentified factor.\"\n Disarming the Data Doctors: How to Debunk the 'Public Health' Basis for 'Gun Control'\n \n Now this is stuff taken from the study.

   "From: PAUL NIXON \n \n Subj: Kellerman analyzed \n \n Conf: PR_NET (103) Read: No Status: Public \n \n This from a local fellow who works in the health care field: \n \n Last week I covered some of the more glaring and easily understood errors of the two and one-half page 1986 New England Journal of Medicine article by ER doctor Arthur Kellerman which claimed that \"a gun in the home is 43 times more likely...\" \n \n Kellerman used many statistical tricks such as limiting any defensive gun use to that where the trigger was actually pulled and excluding any gun use which ocurreding any gun use which ocurred outside the home (such as the front yard). Using multiple categories and then condensingg the data from there tended to obscure the more obvious factors such as, most suicides in his study did not use a gun. And he also refused to allow criminologists such as Kates and Kleck to examine his \"data.\" Too many to mention here. \n \n Despite the 1986 \"study\" being trashed by every major criminologist, the \"43 times\" soundbite that emerged lives on in news stories and HCI literature. The 1986 \"study\" is actually kind of boring and tacky when compared to Kellerman\"s 1993 NEJM submission Again, without a hint of peer-review (since the peers didn't get a chance to look at the data until May of 1997), Kellerman this time has not only one co-author, but nine!! Five MDs, three PhDs and one BA in total, not a recognizable name from the world of criminology among them. \n \n Oh, and Kellerman was now one of the major recipients of over two million in grants from the CDC. The CDC head that gave Kellerman the money and helped him hide his data from the probing eyes of scholarly criminologists, thus violating federal law, is now President Clinton's pick for Surgeon General. Anyway, the soundbite that comes from the 1993 \"study\"? \"A gun in the home is 2.7 times...\" \n \n On purpose. Kellerman\"s first \"mistake\" is building his is building his paper around a \"case-control model.\" A CCM does well when used to from a general hypothesis about, say, what is causing a particular disease outbreak. But it has a problem with being very sensitive to sample errors and it played right into Kellerman\"s hands. \n \n Kellerman took homicide data from three different counties from August 1987 to August 1992. These counties surrounded Seattle (co-author and medical examiner, Donald Reay\"s jurisdiction), Memphis and Cleveland. He then investigated each homicide case to see what lifestyle factors it had (drug-use, renting/owning). The proper thing to do would have been to use a random sample of people who may, or may not have been involved in a homicide. Having found the \"case\", Kellerman now finds a \"control\" nearby who supposedly shared the demographics but did not have a homicide in the household. \n \n Here is where everything goes to hell in a handbasket. First, Kellerman was only able to get 388 valid cases out of 1860 official reports but only 316 matched controls. Such a small sample is prone to wide statistical variations absent an agenda such as Kellerman et al. It would be interesting to see why, exactly, Kellerman decided to drop so many cases from the study--but none of the analyses that I have read were writtenread were written after 1996. Again, homicides whether lawful or not are included along with suicides. And even \"police\" was listed as a category in the \"Offender\" column. \n \n What Kellerman found was that in the homicide homes, 71% of the victims had high rates of criminal activity which agrees with other studies which find that 75% of murderers and 75% of cop killers are adults with long felony histories.. Hardly something that would compare to the rest of America. No, the gun didn't do it. The nature of the criminal did. Criminals killing criminals. \n \n The study never made an effort to decide whether the person being killed was an intruder --OR--whether the gun which may or may not have been present was actually used. And since Kellerman's study shows that 71% of the homicide victims were killed by people whose relationship to the victim indicates that the killer did not live in the victim's house--and presumably brought his own weapon, if any, with him. All Kellerman asked was, \"In this household where a homicide was committed, was there a gun, any gun, in the house?\" Nothing more. \n \n It turns out that the cases did not quite match up with the controls. While the cases had an overwhelming violent history of crime, assault, drug abuse and, drug abuse and domestic violence (real stuff, notthe pushy- shovey type) the controls background check consisted of, \"Were you ever arrested?\" Well, I have been arrested--failure to appear in court for not licensing my dog. Not the same stuff. Also, nothing was asked of convictions or seriousness of the crime. \n \n Kellerman, goes to the control house which must be at least \"one block\" away from the case house, but no maximum is listed. They could have been way far away from the nasty murder neighborhood. Anyone who has traveled through Phoenix can pass by $200,000 homes and stumble right into run-down apartments and nasty trailer parks in a heartbeat. \n \n So Kellerman comes up with what he calls a \"risk ratio\" or \"relative risk\" which is actually just a statistical \"odds ratio\". Kellerman uses the term \"risk\" to make his pronouncement more terrifying. In logic, this is called an \"equivocation.\" But was does a 2.7 odds ratio mean? An odds ratio of 1.0 denotes a positive risk. Negative 1.0 denotes an opposite association. An odds ratio from 1.1 to 3.0 is shown to mean a \"weak or nonexistent\" association. 3.1 to 8.0 is considered moderate. 8.0-16 is considered strong. And over 16.0 is extremely strong. Kellerman's odds ratiorman's odds ratio of 2.7 then, is meaningless. And his 95% confidence interval measurement of 1.7 to 2.7 shows that his measurement is actually quite good. Tight CI spreads are better. If a CI shifts in one direction, it suggests that the correct number is actually toward that shift. Recall that Kellerman's odds ratio of 43 in his 1986 study was not matched with any CI. Now you know why. :) \n \n So, Kellerman measured odds ratios for other behavioral and environmental factors. I wonder how they aligned with the chance of our criminal buddies getting themselves killed? Let's have a look. The tables might take some adjusting to view properly. \n \n Behavior Odds Ratio Confidence Interval \n \n 1) Victim Drank Alcohol 2.6 1.9-3.5 \n \n 2) Drinking Problems (house) 7.0 4.2-11.8 \n \n 3) Drinking Problems (work) 10.7 4.1-27.5 \n \n 4) Victim Drink Prob (work) 20.0 4.9-82.4 \n \n 5) Housemember drugs 9.0 5.4-15.0 \n \n 6) Victim uses drugs 6.8 3.8-12.0 \n \n 7) Physical fights (drinking) 8.9 5.2-15.3 \n \n 8) Medical attention (fight) 10.2 5.2-20.0 \n \n 9) Any household arrested 4.2 3.0-6.0 \n \n 10 Victim arrested 3.5 2.4-5.2 \n \n ed 3.5 2.4-5.2 \n \n Environmental Factors \n \n 1) Home Rented 5.9 3.8-9.2 \n \n 2) Victim lived along 3.4 2.2-5.1 \n \n 3) Security access 2.3 1.2-4.4 \n \n And now, finally, we get to guns... \n \n 4) Gun(s) in home 1.6 1.2-2.2 \n \n Handgun 1.9 1.4-2.7 \n \n Shotgun 0.7 0.5-1.1 \n \n Rifle 0.8 0.5-1.3 \n \n Did you guys catch the significance of that? Handguns are insignificant and shotguns and rifles are positively good!!! \n \n Oh, joy. \n \n 5) Any gun unlocked 2.1 1.4-3.0 \n \n 6) Any gun loaded 2.7 1.8-4.0 \n \n Ahhh! there's that 2.7 number buried in there. I knew we'd find it. \n \n 7) Guns kept mainly for self-defense 1.7 1.2-2.4 \n \n So as we can see, with the odds ratios alone, we can see that the entire soundbite that came from this study is bogus. But wait, there's more. Presumably, the cops knew if there was a gun in the homicide house since they searched it (even if it was not used in the homicide.) How was the presence of a gun deduced for the control households? Why, Kellerman just asked them. \"Hi, I'm doing a study on homicides with guns (yes,cides with guns (yes, they did tell them the intent of the study) you haven't had anyone killed in your family, do you have any guns there?\" \n \n Well, if you were a felon, how would you answer that question? \"Hell no I ain't got no guns!!\" What if you were unsure whether it was legal to keep a gun? What if the homicide victims were involved in crime and felt (rightly) that they had a good chance of getting killed? Perhaps they have more guns than usual. \n \n Well, Kellerman thought of that. In a separate validation study, he proceeded to get a list of gun permit holders and called them up and asked them if they had a gun. If they said \"yes\" they were telling the truth. \"No\" meant the opposite. Well, if one had a permit, that would mean that they not only went through the trouble of government hoop jumping, but they were likely not felons. So not only were they more likely to be more truthful than the control households, they were also more likely to be cooperative with \"authorities.\" \n \n So, what were the gun ownership differences between the case households and the control households that lead to this magic 2.7 \"relative risk\" figure? It turns out that of the case homicide households, 45.4% of them had a gun somewhere ingun somewhere in the house. Loaded, unloaded, locked, unlocked. And the non homicide control households? 35.8% of them did likewise. A spread of just 9.6 points difference and this guy justifies a two-million dollar CDC grant??!! \n \n I can't take it anymore. For a more thorough discussion on the 1986 study, contact Jews For the Preservation of Firearms Ownership and ask them for their Winter 1997 issue. The 1993 study is handled nicely in the Spring 1995 Tennessee Law Review in an article co-written by Don Kates and others. \n Kellerman Debunked!",

   "\"The 1993 Kellerman study was equally flawed although Kellerman backed away from the 43 times figure and concluded that a person who had a gun in their home was 2.7 times more likely to be the victim of a homicide than one who did not. The paper suffered many flaws as later pointed out by many authors including the likes of Henry E. Schaffer M.D., J. Neil Schuman, and Criminologists Gary Kleck, Don Kates and others. Most significant is that Kellerman's study and paper never underwent a peer review, which is regarded as the final treatment to any work or so called scientific study.

They have been exposed repeatedly by actual criminologists and real doctors as well as our own congress.\n \n StateMaster - Encyclopedia: Arthur Kellermann\n \n \nCritics of Kellermann's 1993 paper responded with a large body of statistical analysis, some accurate (i.e. the study population was urban and therefore higher risk in general, compared to suburban or rural areas; that residents of homes where there is a risk of fatal domestic violence typically are more aware of the fact than external researchers), and some inaccurate (i.e. that members of rival gangs were tabulated as \"family member or intimate acquaintance\"; that the data was \"cherry-picked\"). Particular attention was paid to the fact that he did not \"release his data\" immediately upon publication, even though Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's grants do not require the individual investigator to make data public until there are no more publications to be developed from it. SUNY-Buffalo's Lawrence Southwick, among others, went as far as to publicly speculate \"that Kellermann's full data set would actually vindicate defensive gun ownership.\" [2] In 1997, Congress cut funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's injury prevention center by $2.6 million, the exact amount the CDC spent on the firearms research the previous year; the point was not lost on the CDC. Congress has also added language to every CDC budget since then prohibiting the agency from funding anything that might \"advocate or promote gun control.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, is recognized as the leading United States agency for protecting the public health and safety of people. ... Lawrence Southwick (ca. ... 1997 (MCMXCVII) was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Gregorian calendar. ... \n \n Kellermann continues to be a lightning rod for those opposed to gun control, with large numbers of websites and Usenet postings repeating the attacks (both correct and incorrect) on his research, continuing to claim that he is still \"hiding\" his data, accusing him of fraud, and claiming that the study has been \"debunked\".\n\n \n (More)CDC funding cut after kellerman studies - Google Search\n \n \nand had anti-gun Profs Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig run and study and write a report. The report is Guns in America: National Survey of Private Ownership and Use of Firearms. The only problem was, both Cook and Ludwig were honest men. Rather than being able to discredit Kleck's work, they found they, if any thing, Kleck was conservative in his estimates of DGUs.* You might find the section on flase positives and its flip side, false negatives enlightening, especially the last paragraph:\n \n http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/165476.pdf\n \n Quote:\n The key explanation for the difference between the 108,000 NCVS estimate\n for the annual number of DGUs and the several million from the surveys\n discussed earlier is that NCVS avoids the false-positive problem by limiting\n DGU questions to persons who first reported that they were crime victims.\n Most NCVS respondents never have a chance to answer the DGU question,\n falsely or otherwise. \n \n Also, please note Exhibit 7, page 8.\n \n \n *DGU = Defensive gun use.\n\n \n Now let's see what Dr. Miguel Faria of Doctors for Integrity of Policy research says about Kelleman and people like him.\n \n The Perversion of Science and Medicine: Gun Control and Public Health\n \n \nIn the case of Dr. Kellermann, it was reported that during his formal presentation at the (October 17, 1993) HELP conference, in an emotional moment admitted his personal anti-gun bias (a bias that, as we have seen, is evident in the pattern of his research). [Slide 33] Although in a letter to the Journal of the Medical Association of Georgia, Kellermann denied making such a statement at that specific meeting, he did not actually repudiate his general anti-gun bias. Dr. Kellermann's elitism (and true appreciation of the value of a gun for self-protection), nevertheless, is well encapsulated in the following retort directed at a question by a reporter and quoted in the San Francisco Examiner (April 3, 1994): \"If that were my wife [being attacked], would I want her to have a .38 Special in her hand? 'Yeah,' says Dr. Kellermann.\"\n\n \n What honest doctors and criminologists are doing about it?\n \n \nWe testified about the misrepresentation of data, skewed study populations (as to selection and extrapolations), inappropriate research models for the subject under study, and arrival to preordained conclusions (i.e., results-oriented research) - all evident in the immensely shoddy \"gun (control) research\" conducted by the CDC/NCIPC. The panel was also informed about how the NCIPC researchers breach accepted scientific practice by refusing to release and make available to other researchers their publicly funded, original data for further critical analysis.\n \n We recommended that the committee eliminate all funding for the NCIPC for the fiscal year of 1997, and thereby realize a savings to taxpayers of nearly $50 million annually - and most importantly, effecting a major step forward, towards liberating science from the oppressing claws of politics.\n \n \n \n Conclusion\n \n \n \n Although we were not able to close the doors of the NCIPC, our efforts culminated in a significant defeat for the gun-prohibitionists in public health by the House of Representatives that July of 1996. The House voted to shift $2.6 million away from the NCIPC and earmarked the funds for other health research projects. The redirected funding was the amount formerly allocated by the NCIPC to their discredited \"gun (control) research.\" Dr. Kellermann's gun research was defunded by the CDC, and he is now conducting research on the benefits and need for motorcycle helmets.\n \n The successfully passed Dickey Amendment, which de-funded the NCIPC's anti-gun initiative, hopefully will effect a major step toward restoring integrity to public health and perhaps, returning it to its former traditional role of stamping out infectious diseases and epidemics. Although, the re-direction of $2.6 million away from NCIPC seems a modest attempt to restore the integrity of public health research, it also sends the greater symbolic message: [Slide 35] that citizens, including many scientists and physicians, are not going to sit idly by and allow the perversion of science and medical research for political ends.\n \n Nevertheless, the jury is still out. Whether this victory is fleeting and evanescent or definitive and long lasting is yet to be seen. I urge every one of you to remain informed and vigilant on this issue. As Thomas Jefferson once said: \"To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.\"\n\n \n \n \n Thank you.\n \n \n Dr. Faria is Editor emeritus of the Medical Sentinel and author of Vandals at the Gates of Medicine (1995), Medical Warrior: Fighting Corporate Socialized Medicine (1997), and Cuba in Revolutuion: Escape From a Lost Paradise (2002).\n \n Copyright\u00a91999-2003 Miguel A.

   "This strawman argument is based on a false stereotype. Over 76 percent of the homicides were committed by a relative or acquaintance of the victim, and only 3.6 percent were verified as strangers breaking in. Furthermore, arguments and romantic triangles comprised half the homicides. But the most important point here is that a gun in the home only raised the risk of gun homicide -- not homicide by any other means. The most straightforward explanation is that greater gun availability transformed a normal family fight into something much more deadly.\n\n \n If that claim doesn't make you prickle like a lightening strike and make you actually THINK of the probability of this asinine statement being true then there is NO hope for you. Even kellerman said he would want his wife to have a .38 in my last post. Think he realized he would be 43 times more likely to die at the hands of his wife than by any other means? That claim you made reminds me of a bottom feeder without any common sense what so ever!\n \n In any gun study of means of death, guns rank far down the list, even down from drownings in 5 gallon buckets but you put that trophy up as absolute fact? That is so pitiful it is not worth a giggle, much less a lol. The obvious answer for your ilk would be to ban romantic relationships.\n \n Is this poem about you star gazer?\n SUSIE \n LEE DONE FELL IN LOVE,\n SHE PLANNED TO MARRY JOE.\n SHE WAS SO HAPPY \n 'BOUT IT ALL,\n SHE TOLD HER PAPPY SO.\n \n PAPPY TOLD HER, SUSIE \n GAL,\n YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER.\n I'D JUST AS SOON YO' MA DON'T \n KNOW,\n BUT JOE IS YO' HALF BROTHER.\n \n SO SUSIE PUT ASIDE HER \n JOE\n AND PLANNED TO MARRY WILL.\n BUT AFTER TELLING PAPPY THIS,\n HE \n SAID, 'THERE'S TROUBLE STILL.'\n \n YOU CAN'T MARRY WILL, MY GAL,\n AND \n PLEASE DON'T TELL YO' MOTHER.\n BUT WILL AND JOE, AND SEVERAL MO'\n I \n KNOW IS YO' HALF BROTHER.\n \n BUT MAMA KNEW AND SAID, MY CHILD,\n JUST \n DO WHAT MAKES YO' HAPPY.\n MARRY WILL OR MARRY JOE;\n YOU AIN'T NO KIN \n TO PAPPY.",

THEY ALSO REPORT A 4.4% DROP IN VIOLENT CRIME. Lott has been vendicated yet again.\n \n What you and KT arue is that their must be dead bodies for proof or either a body being treated in a hospital for a gunshot wound and even go so far as trying to come up with some excuse that fact alone is all that matters. We and Doctors For Integrity in Medical Research know better. A 10% drop in homicides is more than KT \"generously allowed\" to garnish his wild A guess in an attempt to emphasise his garnished figure.\n \n The UK, especially England and GB have increases in all catagories since your gun bans. ...and you are proud of this? Victoria, a state in Aussie land of antipodeans, garnished an increase of violent crime of 400% the first year of the gun ban. Now you can slink around like a skunk and try to appear you have the \"faith\" but it is removed far from you and the stink will never go away. DGUs by their statistical odds as in the prison survey by Wright and Rossi, show the fear of an armed homeowner is greater than their fear of cops by a large factor! Your disarmed nation punishes anything to do with guns by law abiding citizens, give criminals a free ride, and punishes the innocent rather than the criminal.\n \n I still maintain you got a serious short in the synapses!\n \n What qualifications does KT have other than a certificate to teach computer science at a trade school? Jesus star gazer you stoop too low to have any credibility at all.

In 1997, congress deleted the money from CDC budget and passed a law that no farther trash would be funded by CDC. Now, they think they have found a way around this ban on funding trash studies and produced yet another by funding another group to publish a new study that has Paul Helmke absolutely ecstatic.\n \n It didn't fly then and will not fly now. You lost the war on the 2A being an individual right by a unanimous SCOTUS ruling and are about to lose again on the incorporation issue.\n \n Your ignorace is to ignore the fact that most criminals will avoid any house or person who they think could be armed which deters crime by criminals even from unarmed people like yourself (so you claim) and try to brush that off as not a D eterrant G un U se.

They pointed out the shortcomings of the NCVS under reporting by as much as 2/3rds. I know what their questions are, I will use an example in my quote. That is a large part of KT and your problems.\n \n \nThus, while the observed associations may reflect a causal albeit unspecified path-way, they may also be entirely spurious. As Kellermann and his colleagues note (1993:1089), \"it is possible that reverse causation accounted for some of the association we observed between gun ownership and homicide.\"\n AN ADMISSION. Now the story of the types of studies. Note your favorite which is laid bare by the committe of the National Committee Press:\n \n \nWithin the past five years, have you yourself or another member of your household used a handgun, even if it was not fired, for self-protection or for the protection of property at home, work, or elsewhere? Please do not include military service, police work, or work as a security guard.\n \n If the answer was yes, they were then asked:\n \n Did this incident [any of these incidents] happen in the past 12 months?\n \n The discrepancies in the prevalence estimates of defensive gun use can and should be better understood. Remarkably little scientific research has been conducted to evaluate the validity of DGU estimates, yet the possible explanations are relatively easy to categorize and study. The two surveys are either (1) measuring something different or (2) affected by response problems in different ways, or (3) both. Statistical variability, usually reflected by the standard error or confidence interval of the parameter, also plays some role but cannot explain these order of magnitude differences.\n \n Coverage\n Perhaps the most obvious explanation for the wide variation in the range of DGU estimates is that the surveys measure different variables. In the NSDS, for example, all respondents are asked the gun use questions. In contrast, the NCVS inquires only about use among persons who claim to be victims of rape, assault, burglary, personal and household larceny, and car theft. The NCVS excludes preemptive uses of firearms, uses that occur in crimes not screened for in the survey (e.g., commercial robbery, trespassing, and arson), and uses for crimes not revealed by respondents.1\n \n McDowall et al. (2000) found some evidence that these differences in coverage play an important role. In an experimental survey that overrepresents firearms owners, 3,006 respondents were asked both sets of questions about defensive gun use, with random variation in which questions came first in the interview. By holding the survey sampling procedures constant (e.g., consistent confidentiality concerns and recall periods), the authors focus on the effects of questionnaire content. Overall, in this experiment, the NCVS survey items yielded three times fewer reports of defensive gun use than questionnaires that ask all respondents about defensive uses.\n \n The McDowall et al. (2000) crossover experiment is informative and is exactly the type of methodological research that will begin to explain the sharp divergence in gun use estimates and how best to measure defensive gun use. There remains, however, much work to be done. The sample used\n \n 1 \n It is well known, for example, that incidents of rape and domestic violence are substantially underreported in the NCVS (National Research Council, 2003). <SNIP<\n \n (CONT)\n \n Furthermore, McDowall et al. (2000) speculate that preemptive uses recorded in the NSDS but not generally covered in the NCVS (which focuses on victims) are susceptible to a greater degree of subjectivity and thus inaccurate reporting.\n \n A number of other general arguments have been raised as to why these surveys might be inaccurate. Some suggest that respondents may forget or conceal events that do not lead to adverse outcomes (Kleck and Gertz, 1995; Kleck, 2001a), while others suggest that respondents may exaggerate or conceal events due to social stigma. Some have even suggested that respondents may strategically answer questions to somehow influence the ongoing public debate (Cook et al., 1997). Finally, Hemenway (1997b) raises what amounts to a mechanical, rather than behavioral, concern\n \n 5 \n See Kleck (2001a) for a detailed review of the various hypotheses about inaccurate reporting in gun use questionnaires.\n \n 6 \n Kleck argues that the NCVS is well designed and uses state-of-the-art survey sampling techniques for measuring victimization, but for exactly those reasons it is not well designed for measuring defensive gun use. <SNIP<\n \n \n Kleck and Gertz (1995), the response rate in the NSDS appears to lie somewhere between 14 and 61 percent.8 The response rate in the NCVS survey is substantially higher, at around 95 percent.\n \n Survey data are uninformative about the behavior of nonrespondents. Thus, these data do not identify prevalence unless one makes untestable assumptions about nonrespondents. *WHICH IS WHAT KT DID A simple example illustrates the problem. Suppose that 1,000 individuals are asked whether they used a firearm defensively during the past year but that 500 do not respond, so the nonresponse rate is 50 percent. If 5 of the 500 respondents used guns defensively during the past year, then the prevalence of defensive gun use among respondents is 5/500 = 1 percent. However, true prevalence among the 1,000 surveyed individuals depends on how many of the nonrespondents used a firearm. If none did, then true prevalence is 5/1,000 = 0.5 percent. If all did, then true prevalence is [(5 + 500)/1,000] = 50.5 percent. If between 0 and 500 nonrespondents used a firearm defensively, then true prevalence is between 0.5 and 50.5 percent. Thus, in this example, nonresponse causes true prevalence to be uncertain within a range of 50 percent.\n \n Prevalence rates can be identified if one makes sufficiently strong assumptions about the behavior of nonrespondents. In the DGU literature, nonresponse is assumed to be random, thus implying that that prevalence among nonrespondents is the same as prevalence among respondents. The committee is not aware of any empirical evidence that supports the view that nonresponse is random or, for that matter, evidence to the contrary. *AGAIN WHAT KT ATTEMPTED\n \n Empirical Evidence\n While the literature on self-defense has been preoccupied with the basic measurement questions, a handful of studies assess the efficacy of defensive gun use.10 Using data from the NCVS, Kleck (2001b) compares the probability of injury and crime by different defensive actions. The results, summarized in Table 5-2, suggest that respondents who use firearms are less likely to be injured and lose property than those using other modes of protection. For example, while the overall rate of injury in robbery is 30.2, only 12.8 percent of those using a firearm for self-protection were injured. Ziegenhagen and Brosnan (1985) draw similar conclusions about the efficacy of armed (although not firearm) resistance when summarizing 13 city victim surveys. Using a multivariate regression analysis, Kleck and DeLone (1993) confirm these basic cross-tabular findings.11 Defense with a firearm is associated with\n \n 10 \n A number of studies use samples of data collected from crimes reported to police. Police records are presumed to understate resistance in general and defensive gun use in particular (Kleck, 2001a; Kleck and DeLone, 1993). More importantly, these surveys cannot reveal successful forms of resistance that are not reported to the police at all.\n \n 11 \n The committee is not aware of other multivariate analyses of the effects of resistance with a firearm on crime and injury. Researchers have, however, evaluated the effects of armed resistance. Using data from the NCVS, Kleck and Sayles (1990) conclude that rapes are less likely to be completed if the victim uses armed resistance. Lizotte (1986) draws similar conclusions using data from city victim surveys.\n \n <SNIP< TO COMMITTE CONCLUSION:\n \n Both Kellermann and Reay (1986) and Rushforth et al. (1974) compare fatalities caused by self-defense and other motivations. Both studies find that people using guns in self-defense account for a small fraction of fatalities in the home. Kellermann and Reay find that there were nearly 5 times as many homicides and 37 times as many suicides as perpetrators killed in self-defense. They go on to conclude, \"The advisability of keeping a firearm in the home for protection must be questioned.\" Rushforth et al. (1974) found similar results and drew similar conclusions.\n \n Although the facts are in no doubt, the conclusions do not seem to follow. Certainly, effective defensive gun use need not ever lead the perpetrator to be wounded or killed. Rather, to assess the benefits of self-defense, one needs to measure crime and injury averted. The particular outcome of an offender is of little relevance. It might be, as Kleck (2001b) suggests, that the ratio of firearm-caused fatalities to fatalities averted because of defensive gun use is a more relevant comparison. Answering this question, however, requires researchers to address the fundamental counterfactual questions regarding the effects of both defensive and offensive uses of firearms that have been the subject of much of this report and have generally proved to be elusive. Simple death counts cannot answer these complex questions.\n \n Case-control sampling schemes matching homicide victims to non-victims with similar characteristics have also been used to infer whether owning a firearm is a risk factor for homicide and the utility of firearms for self-defense (see Chapter 7 for a discussion of the case-control methodology). Kellermann et al. (1993) found that persons who had a firearm in the home were at a greater risk for homicide in their home than persons who did not have a firearm (adjusted odds ratio of 2.7). Cummings et al. (1997) found that persons who purchased a handgun were at greater risk for homicide than their counterparts who had no such history (adjusted odds ratio of 2.2).\n \n In light of these findings, Kellermann et al. (1993) ultimately conclude that owning firearms for personal protection is \"counterproductive,\" (p. 1087) and that \"people should be strongly discouraged from keeping guns in the home\" (p. 1090). This conclusion rests on the implicit assumption that the decision to own a firearm is random or exogenous with respect to homicide in the home (after controlling for various observed factors, including whether a household member has been hurt in a fight, has been arrested, or has used illicit drugs). Cummings and his colleagues (1997) do not draw such strong causal conclusions, but instead simply describe the observed positive association between firearms and homicide.\n \n [I]In the committee's view, the exogenous selection assumption and the resulting conclusions are not tenable. While these observed associations between firearms ownership and homicide may be of interest, they do little to reveal the impact of firearms on homicide or the utility of firearms for self defense. \n \n Thus, while the observed associations may reflect a causal albeit unspecified path-way, they may also be entirely spurious. As Kellermann and his colleagues note (1993:1089), \"it is possible that reverse causation accounted for some of the association we observed between gun ownership and homicide.\"\n",

   "\"The idea that the availability of guns increased the lethality of violent crime was first established by a 1968 study of crime in Chicago by Franklin Zimring, currently a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley. Zimring showed that most homicides and other assaults stem from arguments between people, rather than premeditated gangland-style executions. In addition, he found that assaults with a firearm were much more lethal than those in which the attacker uses a knife, even though the circumstances of gun and knife attacks closely resemble each other in most respects.15 If the number of wounds inflicted is a reflection of the attackers&#8217; homicidal intentions, assailants using knives actually demonstrated greater intent to kill their victims than did the assailants who used guns. A similar conclusion was reached when Duke University professor Philip Cook compared gun and non-gun robberies in a series of studies during the &#8216;70&#8217;s and &#8216;80&#8217;s.6, 16, 17 The implication is that more guns mean more death, and policies that can keep guns from violence-prone individuals should reduce the number of homicides. In addition to increasing the lethality of violent acts against individuals, guns enhance assailants ability to, within seconds, wound or kill many people, including children and other innocent by-standers. It is no surprise that incidents in which assailants seriously injure or kill many people with weapons other than firearms are quite rare in the U.S. where firearms are so plentiful. As a result, policy makers and researchers have struggled to identify ways to keep guns away from those who are most likely to misuse them, while preserving access to guns for most law-abiding adults. Among the gun control measures that are designed to reduce the availability of guns to potentially dangerous individuals include regulations that require background checks to screen eligible from ineligible buyers, registration of firearms, licensing of firearm owners, and restrictions on the number of firearms that can be legally purchased. Most of these measures have not be adequately evaluated, however, there is some evidence that background checks requirements for handgun sales have some effect in reducing violent behavior by convicted felons. Policy makers have also sought to regulate gun design with the objective of minimizing public health costs associated with gun misuse. Examples of this approach include bans on guns with fully-automatic firing mechanisms and proposals to require all new handguns to come equipped with devices that prevent unauthorized use.

Not surprised.\n \n \nZimring showed that most homicides and other assaults stem from arguments between people, rather than premeditated gangland-style executions.\n\n \n Zimring obviously never visited Chicago, Los Angelas or DC.\n \n \nIn addition, he found that assaults with a firearm were much more lethal than those in which the attacker uses a knife, even though the circumstances of gun and knife attacks closely resemble each other in most respects.\n\n \n So what?\n \n \nThe implication is that more guns mean more death\n\n \n Then why is DC's murder rate at its lowest point in decades, and only after the Heller ruling?\n \n \nand policies that can keep guns from violence-prone individuals should reduce the number of homicides.\n\n \n So Zimring agrees that keeping dangerous criminals locked up is the best way to do things.\n \n I'm glad we can all agree on this.\n \n \nIn addition to increasing the lethality of violent acts against individuals, guns enhance assailants ability to, within seconds, wound or kill many people, including children and other innocent by-standers.\n\n \n On the flip side of the coin, firearms enhance a person's ability to quickly and effectively disable violent assailants in a matter of seconds.\n \n Only fools wait ten minutes for the police to come to the rescue.\n \n \nIt is no surprise that incidents in which assailants seriously injure or kill many people with weapons other than firearms are quite rare in the U.S. where firearms are so plentiful.\n\n \n There's a knifing in Britain every four minutes. Explain that.\n \n \nAs a result, policy makers and researchers have struggled to identify ways to keep guns away from those who are most likely to misuse them, while preserving access to guns for most law-abiding adults.\n\n \n How hard is it to comprehend the idea of locking up dangerous offenders like drug dealers and gang members? It's not rocket science, and it's a lot better than trying the route of \"Maybe if we take this other thing away from the people it might make a difference.\"\n \n But then you wouldn't care about that, because it doesn't fit your policy.\n \n \nAmong the gun control measures that are designed to reduce the availability of guns to potentially dangerous individuals include regulations that require background checks to screen eligible from ineligible buyers,\n\n \n Straw purchasers easily defeat that measure. Even you've admitted it.\n \n Next!\n \n \nregistration of firearms,\n\n \n How would registration of the tool tell you when a person is ineligible to possess it? Furthermore how would it inhibit even one crime?\n \n And how would registration help if you never recover the gun to perform a trace?\n \n \nlicensing of firearm owners,\n\n \n So you want us reduced to the status of sex offenders because we choose to exercise a constitutional right?\n \n \nand restrictions on the number of firearms that can be legally purchased.\n\n \n At one time, or all together? Are you talking one gun a month laws, or are you suggesting a permanent lifetime cap after people reach a certain number?\n \n How would any good come from that? Can you defend this position? Or is this just gonna be another case of us kicking the XXXX out of you because you're as two dimensional as a piece of paper?\n \n \nMost of these measures have not be adequately evaluated,\n\n \n There's no point in evaluating what we know won't work. That's like asking why we aren't trying to better protect the tasmanian tiger from extinction.\n \n \nhowever, there is some evidence that background checks requirements for handgun sales have some effect in reducing violent behavior by convicted felons.\n\n \n How does this occur when you factor in straw purchasers and back alley arms dealers?\n \n \nPolicy makers have also sought to regulate gun design with the objective of minimizing public health costs associated with gun misuse.\n \n \n Pure BS. There's no way to make a gun somehow \"less deadly\" without rendering it useless.\n \n Are you going to take up your old argumentative position that certain types of firearms are somehow \"five times more deadly\" than others types? That if you get shot with a certain gun you'll be \"three times more dead\" than you would if you got shot with another?\n \n \nExamples of this approach include bans on guns with fully-automatic firing mechanisms\n\n \n How many people have been killed with legal machine guns?\n \n \nand proposals to require all new handguns to come equipped with devices that prevent unauthorized use.\n\n \n 100% impossible. There's no way to manufacture a gun that can become a one trick pony and work for only one individual.\n \n You should be ashamed of yourself for repeating this notion. It amounts to a defacto ban.\n \n \nThere is also evidence that restrictions on carrying of guns in public places,\n\n \n So after decades of widespread concealed carry, you still can't trust people to be responsible and not open fire in a crowd just because it's Monday morning?\n \n \nparticularly in high-risk settings\n\n \n What qualifies as a \"high risk setting\"?\n \n \nand often with stepped-up enforcement, can significantly reduce gun violence.\n\n \n Enforcement of what, prohibitions on carrying in certain undefined \"high risk settings\"? What're you going to propose; setting up block by block check points so all cars and drivers can be stopped and thoroughly searched?\n \n \nAlthough research by John Lott and Gary Kleck has challenged the prevailing view that gun regulations can reduce lethal crimes, the many limitations of Lott's and Kleck's research indicate that there is no reason to move from view of guns and violence backed by research in previous decades. Until proven otherwise, the best science indicates that more guns will lead to more deaths.\"\n http://www.bmsg.org/pdfs/myths.pdf\n\n \n The Supreme Court disagreed with you. They eviscerated your entire argument in the Heller ruling. Yours in the position of a dead animal that's ready for stuffing and mounting.",

   "No, that is the findings of the National Publishing Committee! That is, unless you want to call the NCVS an \"experimental survey.\n\n Right from your post:\n \"McDowall et al. (2000) found some evidence that these differences in coverage play an important role. In an experimental survey that overrepresents firearms owners, 3,006 respondents were asked both sets of questions about defensive gun use, with random variation in which questions came first in the interview. By holding the survey sampling procedures constant (e.g., consistent confidentiality concerns and recall periods), the authors focus on the effects of questionnaire content. Overall, in this experiment, the NCVS survey items yielded three times fewer reports of defensive gun use than questionnaires that ask all respondents about defensive uses.\"\n \n \n\n Your claim that more criminal gun use holds no water! Kleck and Lott are right and history has proven it. Just consider that violent crime and murder are at the lowest levels since stats have been kept and more guns than ever per personal use.\n\n Claiming it does not make it so. Even if crime has fallen it does not mean it's because, for example, more handguns being carried in public which Lott claimed. You're going to have to do better than that to get past the numerous scholarly criticisms that have dealt devastating blows to Lott's and Kleck's studies. \n \n \n \n\n You sure you want to get into this despite Kellerman's own admission, his \n illegal funding by CDC, the near ruin of NEJM which led to appointment of a \n new director, and the findings of JAMA?

   "Not until you prove otherwise. This is your argument, I'm not gonna make it for you. My job is to knock your argument down and disgrace you.\n\n But you aren't knocking anyone's arguments by merely stating \"Zimring obviously never visited Chicago, Los Angelas or DC.\"\n \n \n\n I'm more concerned with the concept of why the individual that committed the murder was able to kill in the first place. Why are you seemingly alright with dangerous individuals being let out of prisons?\n\n Keeping people in prisons will do some good but it won't stop them from committing a crime for the first time. \n \n \n\n I've got a better question: what's the got to do with anything? How does criminal use negate constitutionality?\n\n Loaded question. It only negates your misinterpretation of what's constitutional.\n \n \n\n You still haven't provided numbers. Exactly what number of lives saved by firearms ownership would justify said ownership to you and yours?\n\n More lives than are taken by the criminal use of guns. \n \n \n\n Same level of violence and murder, just a different implement.\n \n Are we really any safer now?\n\n Same level of murder? Stop making baseless claims. \n \n \n \n\n What's it matter? Stabbing someone with a knife is assault with a deadly weapon whether somebody dies or not. So if somebody's stabbing another, they have the intent and motivation to commit cold blooded murder.\n\n Doesn't it matter if the victim dies or not?\n \n \n \n\n No you little twit. This shows how little you care about doing what's right, and instead doing what your politics demand.\n\n Don't get your knickers all in a bind. \n \n \n\n How?\n \n Why don't you explain to the class how this would work out properly. Don't just throw it out there and expect us to accept it blindly. Justify it, explain yourself, defend your position.\n\n Obviously, having more undercover officers trying to catch dealers engaging in illegal gun sales at gun shows and in stores would give dealers more of an incentive to follow the law. It's not rocket science. \n \n \n \n\n No arrests were ever made. No charges were ever filed. No court dates were ever set. Ergo no crimes were committed, otherwise the ATF would be gangbusting these sellers.\n\n So Jack the Ripper never committed any crimes because he was never arrested? Enough of your word games. \n \n \n\n Then why are you pushing for it so desperately? Why is your side of the aisle painting gun registration into the picture of some magical solve all solution?\n\n Another straw man. \n \n \n\n This is a forum for discussing gun control, not driving. Take it elsewhere.\n\n Nice dodge. No one claimed it was a forum to discuss driving. It was only an analogy to demonstrate the ridiculous absurdity of your argument. \n \n \n \n\n Have you finally tallied the numbers of how many bulk sales result in straw purchases as opposed to individual sales? Or are you just going to ignore the facts that the numbers aren't on your side?\n\n What numbers aren't on my side? \n \n \n \n\n The Supreme Court didn't address DC's law on the definition of \"machine guns\" but the district quickly abandoned their definition anyway.\n \n Honestly, when are you going to quit beating to death that one little paragraph? It's not helping your side one bit. And when the next Second Amendment case comes before the Supreme Court, the \"longstanding prohibitions\" clause will be eviscerated and rendered moot.\n\n So because it was in \"one little paragraph\" it's not valid? Dream on. Get ready for a second beating with the next Supreme Court case. \n \n \n \n\n Well then present some proof that your proposed restrictions have actually worked. Otherwise shut up.\n\n Why? So you can ignore the evidence again and keep on making unproven claims?\n \n \n \n\n How should I know? I left the UK, I'm free.\n\n Still doesn't answer the question.\n \n \n \n \n\n That's right, that's why criminals don't XXXX with people who are armed with effective weapons. If you don't like that then move to France where people like you belong.\n\n Another unproven claim. \n \n \n\n Which serve no purpose and can only be used after the gun has been rendered useless.\n\n Serves no purpose? So you are claiming that it's just as safe for a two year to play with a gun that has no trigger lock as with a gun that does have it? Or are just more interested in promoting a political agenda than gun safety? Shame on you. \n \n \n\n Three 20 rounders or six 10 rounders, there's no difference. In a school, church, mall, or army base, the differences cease to exist since nobody will ever be able to shoot back. In such a location you could practically walk around with a muzzle loader and still kill to your heart's content, nobody will be able to present opposition since you'll be the only one armed.\n\n It could make a difference in other places.\n \n \n\n Show the number of gangsters that used machine guns to begin with, compared to the number who used more commonly available weapons like handguns and sawed off shotguns.\n\n Even if there were more crimes committed with other weapons that doesn't negate the fact that there have been very few crimes committed with machine guns since 1934 nor does it negate the fact that gun control can be effective. \n \n \n \n \n\n Oh really?

Why do you and Doc Jones try to muddy the waters when someone tries to bring up a study about how the police were able to fight crime by confiscating illegal weapons? Do you oppose the police confiscating illegal weapons? Do you oppose fighting crime? Do you support criminals more than the police?

   "Keeping people in prisons will do some good but it won't stop them from committing a crime for the first time.\n\n \n Well of course not! Even in a police state there's no way to eliminate the possibility of first time offenders. That's not the point though, first time offenders are a minor problem. The real concern are these experienced career criminals that just keep reoffending over and over again. The ones who have been in and out of jails and prisons more than anybody else.\n \n \nLoaded question. It only negates your misinterpretation of what's constitutional.\n\n \n Misinterpretation my *** I'm backed by the Supreme Court on this one. Gun ownership is constitutional. Handgun ownership is protected. Owning an AR-15 can't be banned.\n \n The only misinterpretation around here is that of your side.\n \n \nMore lives than are taken by the criminal use of guns.\n \n \n Again, another thing you haven't proven otherwise on. All you have is misrepresented statistics that, like a piece of origami, can be made to say whatever the user wishes them to say.\n \n \nSame level of murder? Stop making baseless claims.\n\n \n Then prove the post '97 UK experienced a drastic reduction in murder levels.\n \n \nDoesn't it matter if the victim dies or not?\n\n \n Not if the same offenders are still out and about. Assault with a deadly weapon is the same no matter what was used.\n \n Some could argue victims of stabbing have it worse, because a lot of knife users don't wash their weapons, meaning transfer of blood borne diseases is a significant risk.\n \n \nObviously, having more undercover officers trying to catch dealers engaging in illegal gun sales at gun shows and in stores would give dealers more of an incentive to follow the law. It's not rocket science.\n\n \n Two things.\n \n First, the ATF investigates the FFL records to look for discrepancies, and if they find any they revoke the license of that dealer in short order, and take them to court over it.\n \n Second, where's the funding going to come from for these \"more undercover officers\"? How're you going to provide enough for all of the gun stores in a single state, nevermind the whole country.\n \n \nSo Jack the Ripper never committed any crimes because he was never arrested? Enough of your word games.\n \n \n Jack the Ripper is far different than the matters of today. Nice dodge attempt though.\n \n \nAnother straw man.\n\n \n Answer the question or drop the point.\n \n \nNice dodge. No one claimed it was a forum to discuss driving. It was only an analogy to demonstrate the ridiculous absurdity of your argument.\n \n \n Analogy doesn't work. Driving isn't a right protected by the constitution.\n \n \nWhat numbers aren't on my side?\n\n \n All the numbers. You haven't proven conclusively that any percentage of bulk sales lead to firearms trafficking. Even in New Jersey the statistics show that over 98% of bulk transfers never result in a straw purchase resale.\n \n \nSo because it was in \"one little paragraph\" it's not valid? Dream on. Get ready for a second beating with the next Supreme Court case.\n \n \n In 1995 the Supreme Court ruled the \"longstanding prohibition\" of guns inside school zones was unconstitutional. See United States v Lopez. Even when the government ran rickshaw around the ruling and passed the prohibition again, they included a specific provision that specified the law didn't apply to people with a concealed carry permit.\n \n Next!\n \n \nAnother unproven claim.\n\n \n Unproven? There's no evidence that criminals will intentionally avoid armed targets because they don't want to get killed while trying to commit a crime?\n \n \nServes no purpose? So you are claiming that it's just as safe for a two year to play with a gun that has no trigger lock as with a gun that does have it? Or are just more interested in promoting a political agenda than gun safety? Shame on you.\n\n \n A trigger lock can only be used after the gun has been emptied, thus rendering it useless. A two year old could pull the trigger on an empty gun a billion times, and no harm would ever occur to them. Thus trigger locks are useless for preventing accidents.\n \n \nIt could make a difference in other places.\n\n \n Could, but won't. Never happens. Even when 10 round magazines were the law, criminals still had access to ones that held 20, 30, even 75 rounds. Your side never did a thing about that fact.\n \n \nEven if there were more crimes committed with other weapons that doesn't negate the fact that there have been very few crimes committed with machine guns since 1934 nor does it negate the fact that gun control can be effective.\n \n \n Nor is it justification for excessive levels of paperwork, taxes and control.\n \n \nSmart Lock Technology Inc.

Those aren't smart guns, those are gun locks. Even the 1911 conversion kit doesn't qualify, because it can be used by anyone holding a magnet.\n \n \nBad analogies. In those cases the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\n \n And the benefits of national gun ownership outweigh the risks, because the criminals will have less opportunity to exercise a force monopoly.\n \n \nYou'd be exposed to it even with a gun.\n \n \n More propaganda from the left. This is no different than telling women \"even if you had a gun for defense what's keeping somebody from knocking you down and taking it away from you?\"\n \n \nI checked the footnotes.

   "Here is what we know about who commits crimes and murder.\n \n   FBI: Burgeoning gangs behind up to 80% of U.S. crime \n \n Gun Violence and Constitutional Issues \n The FBI statistics reveal that 75 percent of all violent crimes for any locality are committed by six percent of hardened criminals and repeat offenders.18 Violent crimes continue to be a problem in the inner cities with gangs involved in the drug trade.\n\n \n  Study done by the University of Tennessee Med school \nLooking only to official criminal records, data over the past thirty years consistently show that the mythology of murderers as ordinary citizens does not hold true. Studies have found that approximately 75% of murderers have adult criminal records, and that murderers average a prior adult criminal career of six years, including four major adult felony arrests. These studies also found that when the murder occurred [a]bout 11% of murder arrestees [were] actually on pre-trial release--that is, they were awaiting trial for another offense. \n \n The fact that only 75% of murderers have adult crime records should not be misunderstood as implying that the remaining 25% of murderers are non-criminals. The reason over half of those 25% of murderers don't have adult records is that they are juveniles. Thus, by definition they cannot have an adult criminal record. Juvenile criminal records might well show these murderers to have extensive serious criminal records. \n\n \n \n \n   Violence in America - Effective Solutions \n more than two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are involved with drug trafficking or have evidence of ante-mortem illicit drug use.\n \n Not only do the data show that acquaintance and domestic homicide are a minority of homicides,[26] but the FBI's definition of acquaintance and domestic homicide requires only that the murderer knew or was related to the decedent. That dueling drug dealers are acquainted does not make them \"friends.\" Over three-quarters of murderers have long histories of violence against not only their enemies and other \"acquaintances,\" but also against their relatives.\n \n The gun control advocacy literature from the \"medical community\" shows that fully two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are, in fact, drug dealers and their customers who wreak tremendous human and economic havoc upon society. In failing to account for this, the medical literature cannot and does not honestly assess these deaths.\" \n\n \n  CRIME: THE INNER-CITY CRISIS\nThe problem of youth homicide is very heavily concentrated in black males aged 15-19.3\n For inner-city black teenagers, the homicide rate is astronomical. The huge rise in gun crime perpetrated by older urban teenagers has not been replicated in other areas. In the suburbs, where legal restrictions on guns are generally less severe, the mortality rate has stayed about the same.\n \n Gun control advocates sometimes convey the impression that current murder rates are dramatically higher than ever before. And if one looks at statistics for particular age groups, one finds a substantial rise in murder arrests. From 1985 to 1991, arrests of adults for murder declined, but arrests for murder of 17-year-old males rose 121%; arrests of 16-year-old males rose 158%; arrests of 15-year-old males rose 217%; and arrests of boys 12 and under rose 100%.\n \n The white youth homicide arrest rate has remained stable, while the black rate has skyrocketed. Some drug policy scholars trace the sudden upsurge in violence to the pharmacological effects of crack/cocaine. Economist Sam Staley argues that the war on drugs and the criminalization of the drug trade generate levels of violence that make the inner city unlivable, with levels of violence far higher than would occur in a world where drugs were controlled by means other than the criminal law.20 Since drug dealers are likely to be carrying large sums of money, they are at serious risk of robbery.X Since they cannot rely on the police for protection, they must, to survive, protect themselves.\n\n \n   Fact 7: Crime, Violence, and Drug Use Go Hand-In-Hand -- From the DEA\n A 1997 FBI study of violence against law enforcement officers found that 24 percent of the assailants were under the influence of drugs at the time they attacked the officers and that 72 percent of the assailants had a history of drug law violations.\n",
