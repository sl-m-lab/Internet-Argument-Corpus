Gun free zones are areas that criminals enter with guns because they know they are no armed law-abiding citizens there to stop them.\n \n Criminals enter gun free zones with guns to commit crimes against unarmed law-abiding citizens.\n\n \n How many criminals really go to a school to commit a crime because they are worried about armed citizens? This is going a little too far. The gun free zones at schools were enacted in response to school shootings. While I will admit that this is kind of an odd paradox (like the guy who is getting ready to shoot up a school is going to stop because he doesn't want to commit a class 3 non person felony by taking a gun into a gun free zone), at least the intent of these laws was not specifically to chisel away at our rigts. I can honestly sy I think te folks that instituted this honestly believed they were protecting kids.\n \n I think there should be an exemption for teachers and administrators, though.

   "The original intent and purpose of the Second Amendment was to preserve and guarantee, not grant the pre-existing right of individuals, to keep and bear arms. Although the amendment emphasizes the need for a militia, membership in any militia let alone a well regulated one, is not required to exercise the right to keep and bear arms. \n \n The Second Amendment is an individual right. It does not say the \"militia\" has the right to keep and bear arms, it says the people have that right. \n\n \n States and municipalities have varying laws concerning the bearing of guns. Check it out for yourself. I'm just stating what I believe to be true:\n \n Mississippi has a gun slinger law that allows any non-felon to carry a gun. That doesn't mean they can carry one into the courthouse. In the old West, almost everyone \"slung iron\", but there were places that they had to check their guns at the door.\n \n In some places, you can carry a concealed weapon, in others, you cannot.\n \n In Kennesaw, Georgia, the law says every home must have a gun inside. (The crime rate is well below average there.)\n \n Establishment of gun-free-zones is not in conflict with our right to bear arms. There are places where the presence of guns is detrimental to the safety of people due to the emotional instability of other people who may have a gun within reach.\n \n Legally owned guns should be \"checked at the door\" or left at home when a person enters a designated gun-free-zone. Law abiding people will have no problem with this. It is the criminals who will object.\n \n When guns are outlawed, only criminals will have guns. emoticon_xhoho",

(Oct. 29, '98) -- The nation was horrified when 16-year-old Luke Woodham walked into his Pearl, Mississippi, High School with a .30-30 hunting rifle, shot to death his ex- girlfriend and her close friend, then shot and wounded seven other students. \n \n Then the nation learned Woodham had stabbed his mother to death earlier that morning. \n \n Then the nation learned that the local prosecutor had charged six more students with having conspired in the killings as part of a Satanic plot. \n \n What most of the nation never learned was that Assistant Principal Joel Myrick, using his own gun, stopped the killer as he tried to flee the school. \n \n The news media virtually ignored the fact that an armed citizen had possibly prevented more bloodshed -- using a gun possessed in violation of the Federal Gun-Free School Act, which prohibits firearms within 1,000 feet of a school. \n \n To find out what happened I talked to the school's principal, Roy Balantine. \n \n Mr. Balantine said when he heard the shots he ran into the hall and \"saw a kid with a gun,\" then immediately called 911. Mr. Myrick, he said, was in his office on the opposite side of a \"commons\" that the school surrounds. \n \n Myrick also had run into the hall and seen a student with a rifle; he shoved several students into his office and locked the door, then ran toward the shooting. \n \n He saw Woodham shoot and wound one of the students -- and Woodham saw him, so Myrick jumped back out of the line of sight. \n \n That's when, Mr. Woodham told me, \"Mr. Myrick remembered that he had been out to visit his parents over the weekend, and that he remembered that he had forgotten to take his gun out of his pickup. \n \n \"So Mr. Myrick ran across the commons and out the back door and got the gun, and loaded it, then came around the side of the building.\" \n \n At that point, Mr. Balantine said, he saw the student pull out of the school parking lot and pull up behind a car that was stopped at a stop sign. As Myrick ran toward the car, Woodham pulled around the stopped car, but spun out and off the road. \n \n Before he could get the car going again, Myrick was there with the .45 pointed in Woodham's face, demanding \"Why did you do that?\" \n \n That's when Woodham \"instantly became a coward,\" Myrick had told one local reporter. \n \n Woodham must have feared that Myrick would shoot him for he stammered, so Mr. Balantine told me, \"Oh, Mr. Myrick; I'm the one who gave you the discount on the pizza last week.\" \n \n Myrick got Woodham out of the car, made him lie on the ground, pulled his coat over his head and kept one foot on his back until police arrived. \n \n Woodham's rifle was in the car, and he still had 30 rounds. \n \n \"With all that ammunition, we don't know what he might have done,\" Mr. Balantine told me. \"We don't know if he would've gone to the junior high or the pizza parlor where he worked, or what.

While the problem of kids being bullied and ostracised can contribute to the reasons some of these kids decide to shoot their classmates, this is not the debate. I do agree that at risk kids need to be identified and assessed as to the level of threat they provide, and the behavior that causes them to be bullied and ostracised cannot be tolerated. But again, that is a subject for another post. \n \n You propose to abolish gun free zones, and allow people to carry guns into schools. Do you honestly think that some of these kids will care knowing that a teacher or the principle might be armed? Can you assure me that someone will be present to stop a shooting before it begins? Even in the case you presented before, you stated that the principle heard the shooting, then came running out and saw the gunman. By this point, people have been shot. The problem with your method is that for someone to notice that there is a shooting taking place, shots must be fired first in most cases. So in your opinion it is better to let a few people die first, then get into a gunfight with the shooter perhaps after he has some hostages.

Most of these school shootings are occuring at suburban or rural schools with no known history of gun problems in the past. This type of attitude is dangerous.

JustAnotherGuy likes to repeat catch phrases over and over stating that criminals will not obey gun free zones...and only law abiding citizens obey gun free zones. This is something so basic and fundamental that I would assume this is understood. I certainly do not think this constitutes a basis for an argument though. He contends that by employing security measures we are denying people of their constitutional rights. Although repeated requests have been made for him to tell us how he would prevent school shootings...he has not provided any ideas. The only thing he can even remotely come close with is saying that people could defend themselves with guns if they were attacked. But it still leaves schools open to becoming shooting galleries...at least until one of these armed people can respond and kill the shooter. (Unless the shooter by that point has hostage/s. Likely then the rescuer would create more problems than he solves with his gun). But it is all still after the fact. Chances are someone has already been shot before an armed citizen is responding to the situation. But in his mind, a few dead innocent school children are acceptable as long as we do not violate peoples constitutional rights and treat them like \"criminals\". I contend that with simple security measures we can keep all guns out of schools, and eliminate the threat all together. Sorry for misunderstanding you.",

Criminals will simply walk into gun free zones with guns. Criminals will do this in many ways. If there is a fence around the gun free zone the criminal will simply throw the gun over the fence to another criminal. If there is a check point with a metal detector a criminal will create a disturbance to distract the security officer then walk past the check point.\n\n \n I must be blind. Where have I vilified law-abiding citizens. You think it's so easy to get around security ;) Perhaps if you try to \"create a disturbance\" to get a gun past security at an airport we'll see how far you get.",

I meant to say that this guard was a bad example as it is obviously not a guard's job to run away.\n\n \n That's okay. We all are woefully lacking, at times, to express ourselves correctly. No Problem. BTW, we agree.\n \n \nDo you want a teachers militia to secure schools? Their main concern should be to educate, n\u00f3t to observe the scene.\n \n \n 99.99 % of the time, they would be teaching. It would probably never be necessary to ever do otherwise, but this asks a question. If your child was in a school such as Columbine when the **** hit the fan, would you have been glad there was a teacher or teachers present, armed, but not to the knowlege of the perps, that were willing to place themselves in danger to protect your kid/s? To me, it's a no brainer, but hey, that's just me.\n \n \nPupils that can legally go to school armed still frighten me in some way. \n\n \n The chances are your fears are groundless. Kids use to be able to take firearms to school and never killed anyone by doing stupid things. They can't even take a pocketknife to school any longer. Someone will bitch and raise hell about it.\n \n \nThere are always too many XXXXXX who like to show off and injure someone with a weapon.\n \n \n Is this truly a fear, or are you attempting to transfer what you may do, in like circumstances, to others. I have two grandsons I would trust implicitly to take firearms to school. They both have been taught and know what a firearm is capable of.

   "Comedian, I had written a nice epistle regarding the post last evening.

Unfortunatly, the anti gunners like to use example of the few times that there are violent episodes in our schools to push their agenda. I think that they most likely sit at home with their fingers crossed just waiting for columbine type massacres so they can rally the american public and get stupid laws passed. \n \n \n Difference is that we cannot control lightning, we can control kids bringing guns into schools and killing other kids.

My agenda is certainly not \"anti-gun\", it is anti-gun crime. I am all for guns, I own 8 of them myself.

That's why I argue about things like gun-free zones or armed passengers, not banning guns in the US alltogether. That would be an unrealistic goal for the far future.\n\n \n Sorry, Comedian, I had forgottened this thread. Let me suggest to you, in relation to your above posting, if a nut case or one simply wishing to make some grandiose statement decides to shoot up a place, ( and this is not as common as the media would have you believe ) is he/she more likely to attempt to do so where he/she knows there are armed citizens, or in a 'gun free' zone?\n \n \n\n No, thanks. :)\n \n I shot a lot during my military service (where the real fun with guns begins) and it really is fun and it certainly gives you an immense feeling of power (the last can be good and bad). But I don't think that introducing guns into our gun-free society would lower our crime rate; which isn't too alarming anyway.\n\n \n Then, of course, the benefits may not be worth the introduction. I certainly have no quarrel that with something that works in another country, as it is not any of my business. My quarrel is those from another country thinking their agenda will work here, and in reality, not having a clue about the American crime culture. \n \n \nMy suggestion was to install some kind of agency (that was what I meant with 'office') that supervises the whole gun safety subject.\n\n \n I'm not sure how it works where you live, ( Germany, I think you stated ) but this country is over run with beauracratic XXXXXX as it is. The llast thing we need is another beauacracy, with all the entailing costs, that would accomplish little, except yo promote their own careers. \n \n \nSchools had an official partner throughout the country and old prejudices between the NRA and anti-gunners would be needless.\n But I am not sure if this would even be possible because maybe this would fall under state law.\n\n \n The partnership between the NRA, schools, and government, lasted for a good while, but alas, the damned GGs have screwed that up.\n \n \nAre there already any or is it forbidden to introduce shooting clubs in schools?\n\n \n I'm not sure, but I would doubt seriously if such programs exist any longer.\n \n \nThe only thing that all countries seem to have in common is maybe the non-lack of crappy politicians. :p\n\n \n Unfortunately, you are only too correct. I have advocated for quite a while now, putting politicians on short rations, and weeding out the incompetents and ne'er do wells.\n \n \nIn that case a law is useless.\n I hope this is not a too big problem in the US in general when it comes about new laws?\n\n \n This is exactly what happens when most politicians believe they know better than the people that sent them to office, exactly what the people need.\n \n It may be a world wide problem. I suspect it is. It seems though, we have an overabundance of congresscritters in this country that have gone way beyond their level of incompetence.\n \n Again, sorry for not responding sooner.
