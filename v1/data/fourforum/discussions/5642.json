   "Notice how the upward push in the dollar valuation has had no effect on the price of crude oil. More water to pour on the silly \"inflation\" link. The great irony is that a stronger dollar will actually help the pitiful European economies and potentially bad for our economy.\n ============================\n Dollar hits 9-mth high vs euro\n \n Sunday June 12, 10:20 PM EDT\n \n By David McMahon\n \n TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar jumped to a nine-month high against the euro on Monday as traders shrugged off a meeting of G8 finance ministers and focused on the prospect of more rises in U.S. interest rates.\n \n It also hit a nine-month peak versus a basket of major currencies after data on Friday showed an unexpected narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit -- one of the main drivers of the dollar's three-year decline to the end of 2004.\n \n Dealers said the U.S. currency was still riding high on comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan last week. He told a congressional committee that the U.S. economy was on a \"firm footing\" and suggested interest rates still had room to rise.\n \n \"We're likely to see the dollar move higher this week, especially after Greenspan's upbeat testimony, which the market has not done factoring in,\" said Mitsuo Imaizumi, a forex manager at Daiwa Securities SMBC.\n \n In London on Saturday the finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations plus Russia (G8) kept up pressure on developing Asian economies to adopt market-based exchange rates.\n \n But the meeting produced no clues as to when China will relax the peg of its yuan currency to the dollar, a move many analysts expect would buoy other Asian currencies including the yen.\n \n In line with convention the G8 did not release a formal communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 on foreign exchange.\n \n Instead, dealers focused on data that showed the U.S. trade deficit widened to $56.96 billion in April -- the fourth widest on record but narrower than the $58.0 billion forecast by economists.\n \n At 0145 GMT the euro fetched around $1.2085, down 0.3 percent from late Friday levels in New York.\n \n Dealers said the euro lurched lower after triggering stop-loss orders at $1.2100, taking it as far as around $1.2070, its lowest mark since Sept. 8.\n \n The dollar was little changed at 108.65 yen after rallying 1.2 percent on Friday in its biggest daily gain in more than four months.\n \n DOLLAR UPSIDE\n \n A rise above 108.90 yen would carry the dollar to its highest level against the Japanese currency since October.\n \n Technical charts suggest a rise above 109 yen could then propel the dollar as high as 112 yen in the near term, Daiwa SMBC's Imaizumi said.\n \n The euro has fallen more than 10 percent against the dollar so far this year. The greenback was up more than 11 percent versus the Swiss franc...\n \n (snip)\n \n http://finance.myway.com/ht/nw/bus/20050612/hlm_bus-n12224872.html",

This is the guy who aregued not long ago that the Euro was not actually up against the dollar at all if you considered it (the dollar) against the \"basket of currencies\" that the Euro is based on.\n \n He also probably does not understand that a very minor fluctuation, a hundred pips even, is big news in the currency world. Outside the currency world, it is not such big news, since currencies in the real world are traded at the bank rate.",
