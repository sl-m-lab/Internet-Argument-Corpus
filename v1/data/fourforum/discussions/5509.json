From the evidence I've seen so far, this corresponds roughly to the 30th week. Before that time, the fetus is simply a body without a mind - a thing that simply has the \"potential\" of being a person (by my definition - human with a mind). A thing does not have rights except what the mother chooses to attach to it. \n \n Once the fetus acquires a mind, then a balance has to be made between the rights of the mother and that of the fetus (which I also might start calling her \"child\" at that stage). One situation where I would still give the mother the right to kill the fetus is if the continued pregnancy would seriously jeopardize her life. I'm sure there are many situations which would not be as morally clear, but these are the general guidelines I would use.",
