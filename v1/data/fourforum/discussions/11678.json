   "SnakeSpit, refer to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's recovery plan for America: \n \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt was inaugurated to the Presidency of the United States on March 4, 1933, bringing with him a hope for better times in the midst of the Great Depression. In May of 1933 the Federal EmergencyRelief Administration was allocated $500,000,000 in direct relief of money to be spent by the federal government through state and local agencies. The National Industrial Recovery Act passed by Congress and signed by FDR on June 16, 1933, supported an enormous appropriation of money in the sum of $3,300,000,000 for relief through public works to be dispensed at FDR's discretion.\n \n By January 1934, a Land Planning Committee had been set up within the Federal Emergency Relief Act to consider the problem of land utilization in the country. Land use and maintenance had become an important economic topic during the New Deal, since the income from poor lands was less than the cost to maintain services such as roads and schools for the residents of the land. Conrad L. Wirth, Assistant Director, Chief of the Branch of Planning of the National Park Service (NPS), became the Department of the Interior's representative on the Land Planning Committee. He was in charge of the State Park Emergency Conservation Program and he also had administrative oversight of all the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps operated by the NPS. Wirth was familiar with the 1928 report of the Joint Committee on Recreational Survey of Federal Lands that revealed an \"urgent need\" for natural areas near large cities for recreation. Mr. Wirth proposed a program to buy land near metropolitan areas no longer suitable for agriculture, in order to \"provide quality outdoor recreation facilities at the lowest cost for the benefit of people of lower and middle incomes.\" Farmlands sought for this program were those abused by erosion and poor farming practiecs and labeled with the phrase \"submarginal land.\"\n \n http://www.nps.gov/archive/cato/culthist/wpaccc.htm\n \n Unfortunately, because of the reckless and irresponsible fiscal behavior of Bush/Cheney/Paulson/Bernanke/Cox/Gramm, et al, dire actions like this are needed at the moment.\n \n Putting people to work then made America strong.

What we are facing right now is the price of 30+ years of irresponsible government and irresponsible citizens. \n\n \n Exactly correct. I do take issue with the fact that the current administration has doubled our national debt (operating debt), which has hampered the governments ability to actually respond to the problem. At the same time, that is largely speculative since it is not likely the government could do anything beyond possibly expanding food stamp benefits to actually help out here.\n \n There is a VERY real possibility, though, that the massive extra debt taken on by the Bush administration will end up causing us some pretty serious problems in the months to come as a nearly saturated treasury market struggles to absorb the $1.7 trillion in new treasury issues that we have to push this year. \n \n \n \nThen why did the democrats try to pass unemployment legislation back in June?

I supported the idea, and did so for the same reason that real conservatives everywhere should have...it is cheaper to feed people and put a roof over their head than to fight them. That is also why I think it is important that we fund the food stamps program and do it NOW. A hungry man will fight. People in the US are too heavily armed to starve to death quietly.",

   "As for Palin, she is unknown at best. We have no idea if she is a true conservative because she has to follow McCain. If I had to guess I'd bet she is a rank and file republican which means and Eric Cantor as opposed to a true conservative...and I can't even think of an example. Ron Paul might be the close but he is too crazy.\n\n \n Hello....I am right here!",

I went a step further than my usual \"I will start funding hte other guys\" and actually told 2 of them \"If you vote for this, I will run against you and use every means at my disposal to win...and I need to know now because if I am going to have to unseat an incumbent I have to get started now digging up every piece of dirt I can on you and every member of your family....\"\n \n They both agreed to vote against it.
