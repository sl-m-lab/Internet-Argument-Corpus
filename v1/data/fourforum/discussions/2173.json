   "Racism again has been brought to the forefront. The new \"democracy\" in the Middle East is standing by it's right to protect itself as a Jewish state. \n \n Well that's nice. I remember the world community objecting when certain people wanted Aryan states. But now that Israel, the friendly ally of the U.S., wants to conduct a mission of ethnic cleansing and racial intolerance, the request is granted by the world's superpower. \n \n Endorsing \"rights\" and acknowledging situations on the ground by giving Israel entitlement to parts of the West Bank, is not only illegal, not only goes against the roadmap, but it is plainly morally and humanly unjustified. But when has justice ever been a factor when it comes to Israel or the way in which it chooses to do business or oppress their neighbors. \n \n This latest news takes the last amount of hope from the disheartened refugees that were so brutality ousted from land they called home. The blatant disregard of human rights by supposed world democracies is beyond crimes of humanity. It is crimes against the message they have been trying to send to the Middle East for so long. \n \n This newest attempt to crush hopes of peace, diminish the possibilities of a viable Palestinian state, and tarnish the memory of the Palestinian people, whom have been violently obstructed or murdered over these last 56 years, is just tragic. Ariel Sharon, George W. Bush, and the people that support them don't have the faintest idea of what terror is. If they did and spent a couple of days in the West Bank or Gaza Strip, they could see the terror that is brought upon the Palestinian people by the state of Israel. \n \n Check out my website, poeticinjustice.net, the underground voice in politics\n Remi",

   "How is a Israel a \"democracy?\" I see nothing wrong with their Democratic process. Why stick it in quotes?\n \n Ethnic cleansing? Please. There is no genocide occuring, and it should not noted that fewer Palestinian CIVILLIANS have been killed than Israelis. (Often people decide to count militants as Palestinian victims, which is completely absurd. Including deaths unrelated to the activities of the IDF are also misleading, but included in these counts by some \"humanitarian\" decrying Israeli crimes.)\n \n There is already a viable Palestinian state and a vibrant Palestinian people... in Jordan, established after foreign mandate to be the Palestinian state on 77% of historic Palestine with a 75% Palestinian ethnic makeup. Jordan gave up its claim to the West Bank years ago... if Arafat and his people want to stay in Israeli territory and fight that's their fault.",

   "Broker,\n \n Not sure where your sources are coming from. Only 461 Israeli's have died from suicide bombings over the last three and a half years, while over 2800 Palestinians have been killed, with Israeli newspapers projecting that anywhere from 55 to 60 percent have been civilians, not milititants. Keep feeding the propoganda and maybe someone will go along with it. The fact is Israel is an illegal occupying, oppressive force that has only concede to laws of destruction. It is funny to me that a people can go through genocide, then bring genocide to another people. Hypocritical don't you think?\n \n Remi\n check out my website, poeticinjustice.net, the underground voice in politics",

   "This newest attempt to crush hopes of peace, diminish the possibilities of a viable Palestinian state, and tarnish the memory of the Palestinian people, whom have been violently obstructed or murdered over these last 56 years, is just tragic. \n\n \n You won't get much sympathy for Palestine from Mainstream America; remember how we settled this country. Few posters even seem to understand how Israel was formed as a state by a UN resolution resulting from guilt regarding the treatment of Jews by Nazi Germany and the desire of post-WWII countries to rid themselves of Jews.\n \n Israel was attacked by Muslim countries and did defeat them in every war from 1967 on, the common rational of those who say Israel is entitled to keep real estate gained during hostilities. With virtually unlimited material, money and encouragement from the world's most powerful military, the US, most nations would be able to easily defeat their neighbors. Israel, with a population of 5 million, is the largest single recipient of US foreign and military aid.\n \n Israel is basically our Mideast gunslinger. As long as we have business interests, oil, in the Mideast, we will support Israel. Our foreign policy has been purchased at will by special interests since Valley Forge, and all that's done is become more blatant as the stakes grow larger. Natural resources have always been the root of all world strife.\n \n I'm not taking sides one way or the other, just pointing out the facts of life. Politicians have long known that waving the flag suppresses a majority of dissent, and our system of government is directed by a majority of voters.",
