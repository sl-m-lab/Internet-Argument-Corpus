   "Georgia is brainlessly following American ways and habits. But following the way of the Big Brother it definitely outdid it. Bush and his command at least waited for dispersal of the Tibet demos to occur and only after it they started to call boycotting of the Beijing Olympiad. Georgian president didn't bother to wait and started boycott of Sochi Olympyc Games by bland print!\n Now Georgia declares openly that Olympiad Sochi-2014 can't take place. I guess it's due to fact that Saakashvili hates the idea just. His major argument (the construction of Olympic objects cripples ecology) looks more like a ritual show just! It looks like that Georgian leader can't find something bette. I guess he's still under impression of how the greens tried to persecute him during Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline construction (they had every real reason to)! Saakashvili's lack of foresight and competence becomes apparent in all spheres; he can't make an attempt without assistance and can't copy someone movements even! In reality he should aware of the Russian's healthy ways when they reconsidered their plans to construct Olympic bobsleigh facilities just to please to nature! And they didn't care about money!",
