   "-A 1995 study by UC and Texas A&M economists shows a significant drop in employment rates after th 1990-91 federal wage hike. Employment of low skilled (and often young) males dropped 5%...7% for females.\n \n -The 1978 Congressional Minimum Wage Study Commisson concluded that for every 10% increase in the min wage, 1-3% of low skilled workers would be barred from employment, or lose their jobs.\n \n -A 1995 study at the University of Wisconsin concluded that in states with an increase in minimum wage, low skilled working mothers tended to stay on welfare for an average of 44% longer than in those states without the increase.\n \n -A 1995 study at Michigan State University concluded that higher skilled teens (or those often perceived to be more \"desirable\", such as white teens) displaced lower skilled or less \"desirable\" teens by as much as 20% after a minimum wage hike.\n \n -A 1992 study of New Jersey's employment rate after their min wage hike found that employment declined 4%, compared to neighboring Pennsylvania's employment rate, which remained stable.\n \n -A 1988 study by the Council of Economic Advisors concluded that the increase in federal min wage would result in job losses for minorty, low skilled, and younger workers.\n \n -A 2001 study at Ohio University shows that because of inefficient targeting of the poor and unintended adverse consequences on employment and earnings, min wage laws are ineffective as an antipoverty device.\n \n -A 2000 study out of John Hopkins University concluded that *the proposed federal min wage hikes would harm low skilled and minority teen workers.\n \n -A 2001 study out of Ohio State University concluded that there*is no statistically significant negative relationship between the minimum wage and a lowering of*poverty.\n \n I could go on. The simple fact of the matter is that the min wage hurts low skilled workers (that is, workers whos marginal revenue product is below the set min) and does nothing for the rest of us. I mean, the DOE determined that 38% of people on welfare are functionally illiterate. Four out of ten welfare recipients couldn't perform simple quantitative tasks, such as making change. How can we expect these people, who produce next to nothing, to find a job at $5.75 an hour?\n \n -GFA",
