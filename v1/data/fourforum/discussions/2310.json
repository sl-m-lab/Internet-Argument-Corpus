   "The recent trend of reality programming has me thinking that there is a lack of creative talent and a certain level of laziness and immaturity in Hollywood. The programs themselves are nothing but a collection of immature brats looking for attention, fame and money. The sight of a bunch of guys acting like horny pimply adolescents in adult bodies competing for the affections of a beauty queen (the show was Average Joe) is ridiculous to say the least. Then again I saw a sitcom episode this week (I believe it was Faith and Hope) which was just as immature and childish as the typical reality horndog fest. Jenny McCarthy guest starred as a friend of one of the sisters and her character was dating their 70 year old dad. it wasn't even funny. It was just stupid. I can't believe Hollywood isn't going out of business with all this **** on TV.",

I haven't watched it but my aunt and uncle do and I know they wouldn't watch something childish and stupid. I submit to you however that a majority of reality programming is. I saw an episode of some dating show on MTV where three guys were in some competition for a girl and the girl went to each of the guys bedrooms and was searching for things in one of the guys dresser. She found an unused condom and naturally was disgusted and I'm thinking \"what trash is this\"? Why would anyone want to watch stuff like this? You've got nudity and sex from time to time on the Real World and kids watch this stuff. And of course the FCC is all worried about Howard Stern. For crying out loud that's just radio. It doesn't matter who out there is on radio, there is no way they compete with **** that's broadcast on TV every day.",
