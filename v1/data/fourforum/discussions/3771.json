You better read Matthew 13:10-23.\n\n It's self evident by looking at the presentation and the target audience.\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n According to your alleged interpretation and scripture cited, possibly no one but those who asked for an explanation understood what He was saying when he gave the parables.\n \n His large audience (the crowds) mostly knew what He was speaking of because he spoke in a language they understood. \n Otherwise, Jesus was wasting his breath...no?\n The apostles on the other hand didn't understand and had to ask for further explanation...what's that say about them?\n \n He didn't speak in parables to hide anything but to more easily present his message of salvation for the common man. \n \n 13:18-19 Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.\n \n \n \nYou're RIGHT GOD kept Christ hid by confusing his enemies. It's NOT a secret that there were several Mary's in his life. That helped hide his mother. And the apostle John looked a lot like Christ. Who knows how many people looked like him to help hide him. In fact, they had to PAY Judas to point out Jesus because they didn't know how to identify him.\n\n Can you cite scripture to back up this allegation? 'Mary' (and permutations of it) was a COMMON name in those times and had nothing to do with 'hiding Jesus'. No one HID Jesus or his parents. Jesus even spoke in the Temple as a child...in Public. \n As for Judas being paid...that has nothing to do with His betrayal. His betrayal was pre-ordained and HAD to come to pass. Money wasn't an issue either...seeing as how Judas was the treasurer of the merry little band of adventurers. OH, and was known for stealing from the funds he kept track of. 30 measly pieces of silver would have been nothing compared to the graft he was involved with...recall his moaning about the oils that were used to anoint the Christ??? \"Coulda had 300 silver pieces or more...\" as the song goes. Judas was greedy but he'd have made more money sucking off of Christ than selling Him out.\n Furthermore, they didn't need to have Jesus identified.\n Several incidents had Jesus CONFRONTING the HYPOCRITICAL Pharasies HIMSELF...in PUBLIC. Kinda hard to miss the man who calls you a viper, wolf, beast, hypocrit...\n All of this is recorded in your lauded scripture...\n If you'd take the time to READ it...\n \n \nThey were afraid to do things in public because the outcast that were there to see and hear him would have caused problems. That's why they went after him while he wasn't in public and they needed Judas to find and point him out.\n\n \n Now who's exagerating stuff?\n Was He not brought before Pontious Pilot in PUBLIC?\n Was He not crucified in PUBLIC?\n As celebration for the Holiday when a convict was released...whom did the PUBLIC ask for? Barabaus the Murderer or the Son of Man?\n Were not many who gave false testimony brought forward to condemn Him with lies?\n Nope, his outcast followers deserted him when the FULL might of the authorities were turned upon them. Even Peter denied Him...as was prophesized. \n \n John 8:59\n At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.\n \n Nope, doesn't seem like they were afraid of confronting Him in public so much as Jesus had a history of RUNNING AWAY. No one hid Jesus...just himself.\n Nope, much easier to simply snatch him when that option was removed.\n Thus, the arrest at night.\n A sting operation using an informant. More 'police' officers and schrewd detective work...much like is used today.\n Nice peaceful arrest of a proven heretic and rabble rouser.\n Culminating in eventual trial and sentence. Ho hum...\n \n \n \n So far, from your statements, you make stuff up, cite only portions of scripture you can twist to support your beliefs and ignore the plentiful other passages that contradict those errant beliefs.\n In general, you sound like someone who's sat under a wolf in your church, parroting what ever that's been spoon fed to you.",

I ask in Christ's name but I DON'T pray to him (see the prayer he taught the apostles when they asked him to teach them to pray - THE OUR FATHER).\n\n \n The answer to your question is YES and NO. Christ is ONE WITH GOD but NOT GOD. By that I mean the SPIRIT OF GOD lives in him but he is not god.\n \n Would GOD pray to GOD? Chirst prayed to God.\n \n To really understand this concept you've got to read John 17:1-26 (see below).\n \n \nJOHN Chapter 17 states -- 1 After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: 2 For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him. 3 Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. 4 I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do. 5 And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began. \n \n 6 \"I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word. 7 Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you. 8 For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me. 9 I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours. 10 All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them. \n \n 11 I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name--the name you gave me--so that they may be one as we are one. 12 While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled. 13 \"I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them. 14 I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. 15 My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. 16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. \n \n 17 Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. 18 As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. 19 For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified. \n \n 20 \"My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, 21 that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. 22 I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one: 23 I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. \n \n 24 \"Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world. 25 \"Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me. 26 I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.\" \n\n \n That's Christ prayer (JOHN 17:1-26) to GOD THE FATHER. Read that passage as if you were saying that prayer and think about what Christ is praying for and saying. You'll understand Christ better once you do and you'll be on your way to knowing GOD.",

   "Nestorianism is the doctrine that Jesus exists as two persons, the man Jesus and the divine Son of God, or Logos, rather than as a unified person. This doctrine is identified with Nestorius (c. 386-c. 451), Patriarch of Constantinople. This view of Christ was condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431, and the conflict over this view led to the Nestorian schism, separating the Assyrian Church of the East from the Byzantine Church.\n \n The Assyrian Church of the East refused to drop support for Nestorius and denounce him as a heretic, and it has continued to be called \"Nestorian\" in the West, to distinguish it from other ancient Eastern churches. However, the Church of the East does not regard its doctrine as truly Nestorian, but rather teaches the view of Babai the Great, that Christ has two qnome (essences) which are unmingled and eternally united in one parsopa (personality). According to some interpretations, the origin of this belief is mostly historical and linguistic: for example, the Greeks had two words for 'person', which translated poorly into Syriac, and the meanings of these terms were not even quite settled during Nestorius's lifetime.\n \n Nestorianism originated in the Church in the 5th century out of an attempt to rationally explain and understand the incarnation of the divine Logos, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity as the man Jesus Christ. Nestorianism taught that the human and divine essences of Christ are separate and that there are two persons, the man Jesus Christ and the divine Logos, which dwelt in the man. In consequence, Nestorians rejected such terminology as \"God suffered\" or \"God was crucified\", because the humanity of Jesus Christ which suffered is separate from his divinity. Likewise, they rejected the term Theotokos (Giver of birth to God/Mother of God) as a title of the Virgin Mary, suggesting instead the title Christotokos (Giver of birth to Christ/Mother of Christ), because in their view Mary gave birth to only the human person of Jesus and not the divine.\n \n For others unfamiliar with the term. Seems like more gobblety gook to me.",

In the Book of Acts, when Jesus is being preached it either started a revival or a riot. \n \n Second, the \"sword\" being spoken of above the is the sword of the Spirit - the Word of God (\"Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\" - Ephesians 6:17). \n \n Third, Jesus is saying if someone loves father or mother (or whatever or whomever) more than me they have an idol in their hearts, and that's a violation of the Ten Commandments. In other words, God is supposed to be first in a person's heart. In some translations there is the word 'hate,' which is just hyperbole to make a point. Any pastor worth his salt will tell you the same thing.\n \n So, Jesus is no hypocrite. And no offense, but your understanding of Scripture is superficial, and it's causing you to believe things that are untrue. The Bible does not suffer superficial review. Unfortunately, there's a lot of that going around in these fora.\n \n Now, please provide your evidence that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is a myth. Otherwise admit that you have overgeneralized your claims about the Bible and / or cannot substantiate them.\n \n p.s. beware of the leaven of liberal fundamentalists! emoticon_xbouncer",

   "You made a claim that the Bible is a collection of myths. Show me where the resurrection of Jesus Christ is a myth.\n\n \n The lack of any scientific proof that is was real is all I need to prove it was not. The story of Jesus was written by men to fulfill a prophecy that had been retold for centuries. somewhere around 1200 years before Jesus there was another man named Horus... born of a virgin,.. had 12 disciples.. healed the sick... raised the dead... was crucified... rose 3 days later and was called the savior of man. It wasn't real anymore than Jesus, and the Jesus MYTH wasn't even original. The only PROOF you have that it was real is hearsay..Stories written by men 70 years after the supposed resurrection who didn't even witness the event. \n \n \n\n I have the historical Gospels as my evidence. You have squat so far.\n\n \n If all you have is the four Gospels then you have jack my friend.. The Gospels are stories just like thew rest of the Bible. Written by men who were not eye witnesses.

You are taking the Bible as the literal word of God which it is far from. The Bible is merely a collection of writings put together by men to Control a population. It was a history of the Hebrew nation mixed with fairy tales and camp fire stories. Nothing more. \n \n So no.. that is not absolute proof that the crucifixion is a myth. But does it really matter?. If I showed you proof, which I don't have... you would not believe it anyway. The only proof I have is Rational thought and the fact that the only evidence for it is four books in a Bible that no one can confirm. \n \n As far as your God is concerned we'll leave that for another debate.. it's all hogwash.",

   "\n Yeah I've read that before.. again it is merely a Christians point of view. \n \n\n \n \n No, it's the facts. And your bias won't allow you to receive the truth.\n \n Here's another refutation of your Horus claim:\n \n Was the life of Jesus copied from Horus\n \n According to Egyptian mythology, Horus was originally believed to be the son of Ra and Hathor and the \n husband/brother of Isis. Later he was seen as the son of Osiris and Isis once Hathor and Isis were merged into \n one being. Horus was considered the sky, sun, and moon god represented by a man with the head of falcon.\n \n VIRGIN BIRTH There are two separate birth accounts in regards to Horus (neither depict a virgin birth):\n Version 1: Hathor, the motherly personification of the milky way, is said to have conceived Horus but we are \n told her husband, Ra, was an Egyptian sun god. Hathor (a sky goddess) was represented by the cow whose milk \n brought forth the milky way. By the will of her husband Ra, she gave birth to Horus:\n \n \"I, Hathor of Thebes, mistress of the goddesses, to grant to him a coming forth into the presence [of the god]... \n Hathor of Thebes, who was incarnate in the form of a cow and a woman.\" Source and Source\n \n Version 2: When we examine Isis as Horus' mother, we are told Isis was not a virgin, but the widow of Osiris. \n Isis practices magic to raise Osiris from the dead so she can bear a son that would avenge his death. Isis then \n becomes pregnant from the sperm of her deceased husband. Again, no virgin birth occurs:\n \n \"[Isis] made to rise up the helpless members [penis] of him whose heart was at rest, she drew from him his \n essence [sperm], and she made therefrom an heir [Horus].\" Source and Source\n \n THE FATHER AND SON UNITY Critics suggest the Christian trinity was adapted from the notion of Osiris, Ra, \n and Horus being one god in essence. Because Horus was born after the death of Osiris, it came to be believed he \n was the resurrection, or reincarnation, of Osiris:\n \n \"He avengeth thee in his name of 'Horus, the son who avenged his father.\" Source\n \n Throughout the centuries, the Egyptians eventually considered Osiris and Horus as one and the same. However, \n this son-as-the-father comparison more closely resembles the metamorphosis of Hathor into Isis than it does the \n Christian trinity. We see Horus first as the son of Ra, then being the equivalent of Ra, then Ra finally becoming \n just as aspect of Horus. Similar to Hathor and Isis, we simply see a merger of one being into another. In \n Egyptian mythology, each god had a distinct beginning by being conceived from other gods. In Christian \n theology, God and Jesus always existed as one and the same, neither having a beginning or an end. Jesus' birth \n did not represent His creation- only His advent in human from. Furthermore, the father-son concept was not \n created by first-century Christians. Prophecies in the Old Testament referred to the future Messiah as the Son of \n God up to 1,000 years before the birth of Christ. I Chronicles 17:13-14\n \n CRUCIFIXION AND RESURRECTION Horus is never said to have been crucified, nevertheless to have died. \n The only connection we can make to Horus being resurrected is if we consider the eventual merger of Horus and \n Osiris. But such a theory results in an catch 22, apparently noticed by the Egyptians as they later altered their \n beliefs to fix the contradictions. In the Egyptian tale, Osiris is either dismembered by Set in battle or sealed in a \n chest and drowned in the Nile. Isis then pieces Osiris' body back together and resurrects Osiris to conceive an \n heir that will avenge Osiris' death (although technically Osiris is never actually resurrected as he is forbidden to \n return to the world of the living). Source and Source\n \n \"[Set] brought a shapely and decorated chest, which he had caused to be made according to the measurements \n of the king's body... Set proclaimed that he would gift the chest unto him whose body fitted its proportions with \n exactness... Then Osiris came forward. He lay down within the chest, and he filled it in every part. But dearly was \n his triumph won in that dark hour which was his doom. Ere he could raise his body, the evil followers of Set \n sprang suddenly forward and shut down the lid, which they nailed fast and soldered with lead. So the richly \n decorated chest became the coffin of the good king Osiris, from whom departed the breath of life.\" Source\n \n BORN ON THE 25TH OF DECEMBER Horus' birth was actually celebrated during the month of Khoiak, \n (October/November). Though some critics claim Horus was born during the winter solstice, this shows more of a \n relationship to other pagan religions which considered the solstices sacred.\n \n TWELVE DISCIPLES Superficially this similarity seems accurate until we see Horus' \"disciples\" were not disciples \n at all- they were the twelve signs of the zodiac which became associated with Horus, a sky god. However \n Jesus' disciples were actual men who lived and died, whose writings exist to this day, and whose lives are \n recorded by historians. Because Horus' \"disciples\" were merely signs of the zodiac, they never taught his \n philosophy or spread his teachings. The fact that there are twelve signs of the zodiac (twelve months) as \n compared to Jesus' twelve apostles is an insignificant coincidence.\n \n MOUNTAINTOP ENCOUNTER Critics point out the similarity of both Jesus and Horus having an encounter on a \n mountaintop with their enemies. Instead of dissecting this piece by piece, I will simply give each version of \n events and let the reader observe the (obvious) differences:\n Jesus: After Jesus completes His fast in the wilderness, Satan tries to tempt Jesus by offering Him all the \n kingdoms of the world if Jesus agrees to worship him, but Jesus refuses. Matthew 4:1-11\n Horus: During battle, Horus rips off one of Set's testicles while Set (sometimes called Seth) gorges out Horus' \n eye. Set later tries to prove his dominance by initiating intercourse with Horus. Horus catches Set's semen in his \n hand and throws it into a nearby river. Horus later masturbates and spreads his semen over lettuce which Set \n consumes. Both Set and Horus stand before the gods to proclaim their right to rule Egypt. When Set claims \n dominance over Horus, his semen is found in the river. When Horus' dominance is considered, his semen is found \n within Set so Horus is granted rule over Egypt:\n \n \"O that castrated one! O this man! O he who hurries him who hurries, among you two! These- this first \n corporation of the company of the justified... Was born before the eye of Horus was plucked out, before the \n testicles of Set were torn away.\" Source \"It is the day on which Horus fought with Set, who cast filth in the face of \n Horus, and when Horus destroyed the powers of Set.\" Source \"Then [Set] appeared before the divine council and \n claimed the throne. But the gods gave judgment that Horus was the rightful king, and he established his power in \n the land of Egypt, and became a wise and strong ruler like to his father Osiris.\" Source\n \n Skeptic Interjection: Does the similarity between the names Set and Satan hold any significance?\n Answer: Set's variant names include Seth, Sutekh, Setesh, and Seteh. The root Set is usually considered to \n translate into dazzler or stable pillar. The different suffixes of his name add the meanings majestic, supreme, and \n desert. The name Satan comes from the Semitic root Stn which represents opposition. Before his fall, Satan's \n original name was Lucifer, or angel of light. The term Satan represents a general adversary, hence his accepted \n identity. Though both names consist of an S and a T, their meanings have nothing in common. The spellings are \n only a result of the original root words which represent their character. Source and Source\n \n SIMILAR TITLES Critics allege Horus held similar titles used to identify Jesus such as Messiah, Savior, Son of \n Man, Good Shepherd, Lamb of God, The Way, the Truth, the Light, and Living Word. However I can find no \n evidence of any of these names ever being used in reference to Horus. I am especially suspicious of the word \n Messiah since it is Hebrew in origin.\n \n IN CONCLUSION We can see the differences between Jesus and Horus far outweigh any superficial correlations.",

   "Source..Contradictions of the Gospel\n \n We are told to accept that Jesus existed based upon the Gospels of the Bible, yet the Gospels are so poorly written that a logical person is at best left to ponder if Jesus even existed. The Gospels are consistently contradictory, filled with mathematic errors and don't compliment each other on very important details. This page shall serve as an example for just how unreliable the Gospels are.\n \n \n \n Gospel Contradictions:\n \n 1) How many generations were there between Abraham to David? Matthew 1:17 lists fourteen generations. Matthew 1:2 lists thirteen generations.\n \n 2) Is Paul lying? In Acts 20:35 Paul told people \"to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'\" Since Jesus never made such a biblical statement, isn't Paul guilty of deception?\n \n 3) When did the leper become not a leper? (Matthew 8:13 & 8:14) Jesus healed the leper before visiting the house. (Mark 1:29-30 & 1:40-42) Jesus healed the leper after visiting Simon Peter's house.\n \n 4) Who approached Jesus? (Matthew 8:5-7) The Centurion approached Jesus, beseeching help for a sick servant. (Luke 7:3 & 7:6-7) The Centurion did not approach Jesus. He sent friends and elders of the Jews.\n \n 5) Was she dead or just dying? (Matthew 9:18) He asked for help, saying his daughter was already dead. (Luke 8:41-42) Jairus approached Jesus for help, because his daughter was dying.\n \n 6) Just what did Jesus instruct them to take? (Matthew 10:10) Jesus instructed them not to take a staff, not to wear sandals. (Mark 6:8-9) Jesus instructed his disciples to wear sandals and take a staff on their journey.\n \n 7) When did John find out Jesus was the Messiah? (Matthew 11:2-3) While imprisoned. John the Baptist sent followers to Jesus to inquire if Jesus was the messiah. (Luke 7:18-22) While imprisoned. John the Baptist sent followers to Jesus to inquire if Jesus was the Messiah. (John 1 :29-34,36) John already knew Jesus was the Messiah.\n \n 8) Who made the request? (Matthew 20:20-21) Their mother requested that James and John, Zebedee's children, should sit beside Jesus in his Kingdom. (Mark 10:35-37) James and John, Zebedee's children, requested that they should sit beside Jesus in his Kingdom.\n \n 9) What animals were brought to Jesus? (Matthew 21:2-7) two of the disciples brought Jesus an XXX and a colt from the village of Bethphage. (Mark 11:2-7) They brought him only a colt.\n \n 10) When did the fig tree hear of its doom? (Matthew 21:17-19) Jesus cursed the fig tree after purging the temple. (Mark 11:14-15 & 20) He cursed it before the purging.\n \n 11) When did the fig tree keel? (Matthew 21:9) The fig tree withered immediately. and the disciples registered surprise then and there. (Mark 11:12-14 & 20) The morning after Jesus cursed the fig tree, the disciples noticed it had withered and expressed astonishment.\n \n 12) Was John the Baptist Elias? \"This is Elias which was to come.\" Matthew 11:14 \"And they asked him, what then? Art thou Elias? And he said I am not.\" John l:21\n \n 13) Who was the father of Joseph? Matthew 1:16 The father of Joseph was Jacob. Luke 3 :23 The father of Joseph was Heli. Christians shall try to LIE and tell you that one is the heritage of Mary and the other Joseph. This is utter XXXXXXXX, the Hebrew and Greek cultures NEVER regarded the bloodline of the mother. They were patriarchal societies which only concerned themselves with paternal lineage.\n \n 14) How many generations were there from the Babylon captivity to Christ? Matthew 1:17 Fourteen generations, Matthew 1:12-16 Thirteen generations.\n \n 15) Matthew 2:15, 19 & 21-23 The infant Christ was taken into Egypt. Luke 2:22 & 39 The infant Christ was NOT taken to Egypt.\n \n 16) Matthew 5:1-2 Christ preached his first sermon on the mount. Luke 6:17 & 20 Christ preached his first sermon in the plain.\n \n 17) John was in prison when Jesus went into Galilee. Mark 1:14 John was not in prison when Jesus went into Galilee. John 1:43 & 3:22-24\n \n 18) What was the nationality of the woman who besought Jesus? Matthew 15:22 \"And behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, Have mercy on me, 0 Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.\" Mark 7:26 \"The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation, and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.\"\n \n 19) How many blind men besought Jesus? Matthew 20:30 Two blind men. Luke 18:35-38 Only one blind man.\n \n 20) Where did the devil take Jesus first? (Matthew 4:5-8) The Devil took Jesus first to the parapet of the temple, then to a high place to view all the Kingdoms of the world. (Luke 4:5-9) The Devil took Jesus first to a high place to view the kingdoms, then to the parapet of the temple.\n \n 21) Can one pray in public? (Matthew 6:5-6) Jesus condemned public prayer. (1 Timothy 2:8) Paul encouraged public prayer.\n \n 22) If we decide to do good works, should those works be seen? Matthew 5:16 \"Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works.\" 1 Peter 2:12 \"Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that ... they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.\" This contradicts: Matthew 6:1-4 \"Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them...that thine alms may be in secret.\" Matthew 23:3-5 \"Do not ye after their [Pharisees'] works ... all their works they do for to be seen of men.\"\n \n 23) Who did Jesus tell the Lord's Prayer to? (Matthew 5:1, 6:9-13 & 7:28) Jesus delivered the Lord's Prayer during the Sermon on the Mount before the multitudes. (Luke 11:1-4) He delivered it before the disciples alone, and not as part of the Sermon on the Mount.\n \n 24) When was Christ crucified? Mark 15:25 \"And it was the third hour and they crucified him.\" John 19:14-15 \"And it was the preparation of the Passover, and about the sixth hour; and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your king...Shall I crucify your king?\" John 19:14-15.\n \n 25) The two thieves reviled Christ. (Matthew 27:44 & Mark 15:32) Only one of the thieves reviled Christ. Luke 23:39-40.\n \n 26) In 1 Corinthians 1:17 (\"For Christ sent me [Paul] not to baptize but to preach the gospel\") Paul said Jesus was wrong when he said in Matthew 28:19 \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them...\" Clearly one of these people is wrong, either way, it's a contradiction.\n \n 27) When did Satan enter Judas? Satan entered into Judas while at the supper. John 13:27 Satan entered Judas before the supper. Luke 23:3-4 & 7\n \n 28) How many women came to the sepulcher? John 20:1 Only one woman went, Mary Magdalene. Matthew 28:1 Mary Magdalene and the \"other Mary\" (Jesus' mother) went.\n \n 29) Mark 16:2 It was sunrise when the two women went to the sepulcher. John 20:1 It was still dark (before sunrise) when Mary Magdalene went alone to the sepulcher.\n \n 30) There were two angels seen by the women at the sepulcher and they were standing up. Luke 24:4 There was only one angel seen and he was sitting down. Mark 28:2-5\n \n 31) How many angels were within the sepulcher? John 20:11-12 two, Mark 16:5 one.\n \n 32) The Holy Ghost bestowed at Pentecost. Acts 1:5-8 & 2:1-4 The holy Ghost bestowed before Pentecost. John 20:22\n \n 33) Where did Jesus first appear to the eleven disciples? In a room in Jerusalem. Luke 24:32-37 On a mountain in Galilee. Matthew 28:15-17\n \n 34) Where did Christ ascend from? From Mount Olivet. Acts 1:9-12 From Bethany. Luke 24:50-51\n \n 35) Can all sins be forgiven? (Acts 13:39) All sins can be forgiven. Great, I'm happy to know God is so merciful, but wait (Mark 3:29) Cursing or blaspheming the Holy Spirit is unforgivable.\n \n 36) The Elijah mystery: (Malachi 4:5) Elijah must return before the final days of the world. (Matthew 11:12-14) Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah. (Matthew 17:12- 13) Jesus insists that Elijah has already come, and everyone understood him to mean John the Baptist. (Mark 9:13) Jesus insists that Elijah has already come. (John 1:21) John the Baptist maintained that he was not Elijah.\n \n 37) Who purchased the potter's field? Acts 1:18 The field was purchased by Judas. John 20:1 The potter's field was purchased by the chief priests.\n \n 38) Paul's attendants heard the miraculous voice and stood speechless. Acts 9:7 Paul's attendants did not hear the voice and were prostrate. Acts 22:9 & 26:14\n \n 39) Who bought the Sepulcher? Jacob, Josh 24:32 Abraham, Acts 7:16\n \n 40) Was it lawful for the Jews to put Christ to death? \"The Jews answered him, we have a law, and by our law he ought to die.\" John 19:7 \"The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.\" John 18:31\n \n 41) Has anyone ascended up to heaven? Elijah went up to heaven: \"And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\" 2 Kings 2:11 \"No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, even the son of man.\" John 3:13\n \n 42) Is scripture inspired by God? \"all scripture is given by inspiration of God.\" 2 Timothy 3:16 compared to: \"But I speak this by permission and not by commandment.\" 1 Corinthians 7:6 \"But to the rest speak I, not the Lord.\" 1 Corinthians 7:12 \"That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord\" 2 Corinthians.",

   "There's tons of websites that answer or refute these sophomoric claims (contradictions). You should also type in \"Harmony of the Resurrection\" to see where you went wrong on those.\n \n So far you've been busted on Horus, busted on the resurrection, and busted on your theology (sword of the spirit, etc.).\n\n \n lmao.. these are not my words.. they are the actual scriptures from your Bible showing the contradictions in all their glory. I haven't been busted on anything.. so far you have presented no evidence that any of it is real. All you have is your bible, which is nothing more than a fairy tale account of the history of the Hebrew people.\n \n More Lies told by the Bible...\n \n End Times\n \n According to the Bible the \"End Times\" Should Have ALREADY Occurred!\n \n Jesus and his apostles made MANY prophecies concerning the Armageddon. Christians would have you believe that it shall come as \"a thief in the night\". Yet, the Bible is rather clear concerning when it would happen. Matter of fact, the Bible consistently said it would follow soon after Jesus' death. When you point out such verses to Christians they will try to weasel it out of it by saying Christ was talking about his \"future\" apostles versus the ones he was directly speaking to. All it takes is a close examinations of the pronouns used in order to see that Christ truly did believe the end times would have happened nearly 2,000 years ago. Keep in mind that the Bible claims it is \"fit for reproof' and Christianity \"lives and dies on the resurrection and end times\". If we are to believe these verses and accept that the end time prophecies failed then surely the whole book is invalid.\n \n False Prophecies About the Armageddon:\n \n Jesus' Predictions:\n \n 1) Jesus falsely prophesies DIRECTLY to the high priest (Caiphas) that he would live to see his second coming. Jesus uses the term \"coming on the clouds of heaven\". This clearly negates the \"coming\" as the resurrection but as a return to the earth on CLOUDS, not his return in human form from the dead. Matthew 26:64 & Mark 14:62.\n \n \"But I tell you: From now on you will see 'the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power' and 'coming on the clouds of heaven.'\" (Matthew 26:64 NAB)\n Then Jesus answered, \"I am; and 'you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.'\" (Mark 14:62 NAB)\n \n 2) Jesus mistakenly tells his followers that he will return and establish his kingdom within their lifetime. Matthew 23:36 & 24:34\n \n Amen, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation. (Matthew 23:36 NAB)\n \n \"Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming upon the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send out his angels with a trumpet blast, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. \"Learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branch becomes tender and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near. In the same way, when you see all these things, know that he is near, at the gates. Amen, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. (Matthew 24:29-35 NAB)\n \n 3) YET AGAIN, Jesus claims those standing RIGHT BEFORE HIM shall see the Armageddon. Matthew 16:28 \"There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\" Don't let Christians lie to you and claim Jesus was referring to his modern day believers. The words \"some standing HERE will not taste death\" clearly refutes such nonsense. Obviously the people he was speaking to died, and curiously Jesus STILL isn't here to claim his kingdom.\n \n 4) Jesus falsely prophesies that the end of the world will come within his listeners' lifetimes. \n Amen, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. (Mark 13:30-31 NAB)\n \n He also said to them, \"Amen, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of God has come in power.\" (Mark 9:1 NAB)\n \n 5) Jesus falsely predicts that some of his listeners would live to see him return and establish the kingdom of God.\n \n \"Truly I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.\" (Luke 9:27 NAB)\n \n 6) Jesus implies that he will return to earth during the lifetime of John. (John 21:22)\n \n 7) Jesus says that all that he describes (his return, signs in the sun, moon, wars, stars, etc.) will occur within the lifetime of his listeners. He purposely defines their generation and NOT a future one. Considering that NONE of those signs took place during the resurrection and that he uses the term of \"Heaven and earth shall pass away\", Clearly Jesus is prophesizing that nearly 2,000 years ago Armageddon SHOULD have occurred. Luke 21:25-33\n \n \"There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and on earth nations will be in dismay, perplexed by the roaring of the sea and the waves. People will die of fright in anticipation of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. But when these signs begin to happen, stand erect and raise your heads because your redemption is at hand.\" He taught them a lesson. \"Consider the fig tree and all the other trees. When their buds burst open, you see for yourselves and know that summer is now near; in the same way, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. Amen, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. (Luke 21:25-33 NAB)\n \n [Editor's note: Matthew 10:23 also has Jesus telling his disciples that the second coming will occur before the disciples finish preaching in Israel: \"When they persecute you in one town, flee to another. Amen, I say to you, you will not finish the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.\" (Matthew 10:23 NAB)]\n \n \n \n John's Predictions\n \n 8) John believes \"the time is at hand,\" and that the things that he writes about in Revelation will \"shortly come to pass.\" Revelations 1:1-3\n \n 9) John quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying he will come \"quickly.\" Revelations 22:7, 12 & 20\n \n 10) John thinks he is living in \"the last times.\" He \"knows\" this because he sees so many antichrists around. 1 John 2:18\n \n 11) John says that the antichrist was already present at the time 1 John was written. 1 John 4:3\n \n 12) John quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying he will come \"quickly.\" Revelations 3:11, 22:7, 12 & 20\n \n \n \n Paul's Predictions\n \n 13) Paul thought that the end was near and that Jesus would return soon after he wrote these words. Philippians 4:5\n \n 14) Paul believes he is living in the \"last days.\" Hebrews 1:2\n \n 15) Paul believed that Jesus would come \"in a little while, and will not tarry.\" Hebrews 10:37\n \n 16) In 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 Paul stated: \"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: And the dead Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air: And so shall we ever be with the Lord.\" Paul shared the delusion, taught by Jesus, in that he expected to be snatched up bodily into heaven with other saints then living, who would, thus, never taste death. The use of \"we\" clearly proves as much. It is difficult to deny that Paul was certain that the end of the world was coming in the lifetime of his contemporaries.\n \n \n \n Other Prophecies About Armageddon:\n \n 17) James thought that Jesus would return soon. James 5:8\n \n 18) Peter wrongly believed that he was living in the \"last times\" and that \"the end of all things is at hand.\" 1 Peter 1:20 & 4:7",

   "Is there really any point in you two having a copy-paste duel? Neither of you are actually reading or responding to what is written, and neither is anyone else going to respond to 2 screenfulls of stuff that odds even the poster hasn't even read themselves.\n \n Suffice to say, I think that most of the contradictions in the Gospels lend credence to them as eyewitness accounts recorded some years after the events - the key events will be well known and recalled, the less important parts and minor details will be remembered differently by different people. So, the precise order of events may differ (John's Gospel especially), exactly how certain events happened may be recorded differently. This only lends more credence to the parts where the Gospels agree, and puts the lie to the idea of a conspiracy to make up the Gospel accounts as a means of control - as I said before, if you were going to make up the story you would write one narrative, not four.",

   "All four Gospels are written in Greek, by authors who were reasonably well educated and literate. In comparison with most other persons in the Roman world, all four authors, in fact, evince a high level of education. Something like 90% percent of the general population was completely illiterate - that is, unable to read and write at all. Christians assume that the Gospels were written as part of Gods message to humanity when in fact that is the farthest thing from the truth. All of the books contained in the Bible are separate Stories, Fables, songs, and other documents that were later put together by MAN to become what the bible is today. These stories were NOT written as the Bible. \n \n The Gospels were not written until upwards of 70 years after the crucifixion of Jesus.. and there is no true historical record that they were actually written by eye witness accounts. Even so, the four separate accounts contradict one another so much that it is evident that they were not written by eye witnesses rather people who later wrote what they had heard and added or left out what they didn't remember. Two of the Gospels do not even mention the most important part of the life of Jesus which is the Virgin Birth. Anyone writing a history of the so called savior of man would not have left that part out. \n \n Long story short the Gospels are just like the rest of the book that is called the Bible. Words.. written by men and believed by fools to be the actual word of a God that has yet to be proven to exist. Believing it to be truth and saying it to be truth does not make it true. It's this kind of delusion that will eventually lead to the downfall of mankind.",

   "The New Testament - Historical Eyewitness Accounts and Testimony\n \n Many arguments have been made that eyewitness testimony is unreliable. In some cases that's true. However, our prisons are full of criminals who, at one time or another, were identified by eyewitnesses who were deemed credible by juries of their peers. If you run across someone who contends that eyewitness accounts are never trustworthy, then advise them the next time their husband, wife, brother, sister, mother, or father comes home to be sure to run a DNA analysis on them (just to be sure).\n \n Others say that recorded eyewitness accounts are nothing more than hearsay. If one wants to make that argument then they should know much of what we know from antiquity is derived from hearsay. Historians and other early, contemporary personalities often record historical accounts from other sources. If one wants to throw out \"hearsay\" then the better part of our collegiate history books would have to have vast sections ripped out of them. It would be extremely unfair to have one standard for non-Biblical, 1st century accounts and another one just for the New Testament.\n \n The disciples lived with Jesus for three and one-half years. They very likely knew him as well as anyone could know a very close, personal friend. To say they were deluded or mistaken leaves the burden of proof for those charges on the accuser, instead of on the writers of the New Testament.\n \n With this in mind, the following are just some of the numerous eyewitness accounts contained in the Gospels and Epistles.\n \n Luke 24:30ff - When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. They asked each other, \"Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\" \n They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together 34 and saying, \"It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\" Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. \n \n Luke 24:36-39: While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\" They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. He said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\" \n \n John 20:16-18: Jesus said to her, \"Mary.\" She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, \"Rabboni!\" (which means Teacher). Jesus said, \"Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.' \" Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: \"I have seen the Lord!\" And she told them that he had said these things to her. \n \n John 20:19-20: On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. \n \n John 20:26-28: A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\" \n Thomas said to him, \"My Lord and my God!\" \n \n 1 Corinthians 15:3 -8: For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me also... \n \n Acts 1:1 -4: In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: \"Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. \n \n 1 John 4:14 - And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. \n \n 2 Peter 1:16 - We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.\n \n Luke 1:1-4: Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. \n \n Matthew 28:5-9: The angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.\" 8 So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them. \"Greetings,\" he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.",

I'm in favour of women and gay men who are called to be priests being ordained. How God expects gay people to behave is not my problem, as I'm not gay, but I find it hard to believe that He would make people gay and then forbid them to act on the emotions and feelings He gave them.\n \n Abortion, IVF and contraception all deal with fundamental questions on what life is and whether life is valuable in itself. I have no problem with contraception or IVF, on abortion I would rather it didn't happen, but I'm never going to find myself in the situation of having an unwanted pregnancy and I'm not prepared to enforce my own morality on those people who do.\n \n As for how I determine what is right or wrong - a mixture of things. I start from the two commandments that Jesus said were most important, loving God and loving my neighbour, look at what the rest of the Bible says in the light of modern understanding of how people and society work, and how the church has traditionally interpreted that; and trust that God will guide me to the right decision - listening for what the Quakers and others call the \"still small voice\" of God.\n \n\n Not hanging laundry, buying alcohol or shopping on Sundays seems like a simple decision that can be made by the church for those who choose to follow their direction - EXCEPT - in reality, it's not.

Having a shared day of rest is beneficial to everyone in society, it gives families time together and helps reduce overwork and stress. It reduces the ability of employers to force staff to work beyond what they are happy with. This is why the Keep Sunday Special campaign in the UK gets as much of its support from the trade union movement as it does from the churches. As to why it should be a Sunday, why pick another day except out of spite?\n \n I think religious people have as much right to participate in the political process as anyone else, and I don't think you can exclude one set of political ideas because you dislike the source of them. You have to work on defeating the ideas themselves. If you want to oppose a ban on abortion, you have to demontrate the harm it will do, you can't just dismiss the views of others because you think they're irrational. Few political opinion are rational, they're all a result of core beliefs that may or may not be religious in character. Belief in free markets, or command economics, or historical inevitability, or human rights, or free speech, or democracy, or any number of other political ideas are all largely axiomatic. For most people who use them, they are totemic assumptions, not intended to be challenged. The problem come, both for religious and non-religious people, when the political opinions built on these ideas become themselves axiomatic. This is what seems to have happened in American politics. \"A woman's right to choose\" and \"Abortion is [legally] murder\" have become such fixed positions that there is no room for debate and discussion. This is why clauses about the mother's life being in danger get beaten out of any restrictions, and why there is massive opposition to a time restriction on abortions. Compare with the UK, where abortion is not a political issue. Abortion is allowed up to a certain point, to protect the life and health (including mental health) of the mother, and beyond that to save the life of the mother. This law wouldn't satisfy either extreme in the US, and it doesn't in the UK, but it is roughly where public opinion, mostly secular, is.\n \n EDIT: with regard to the disciples, they were human, with human failings. There was also this little thing called Pentecost, where they got a bit of a helping hand. Plus, Jesus forgave them, the least we can do is to do the same. Besides, if you were falsifying your story, as you claim Peter did, wouldn't you want to leave out the bits that make you look like an untrustworthy, faithless simpleton?",

I start from the two commandments that Jesus said were most important, loving God and loving my neighbour, look at what the rest of the Bible says in the light of modern understanding of how people and society work, and how the church has traditionally interpreted that; and trust that God will guide me to the right decision - listening for what the Quakers and others call the \"still small voice\" of God.\n \n \n This is where we come to a disagreement. Having a shared day of rest is beneficial to everyone in society, it gives families time together and helps reduce overwork and stress. It reduces the ability of employers to force staff to work beyond what they are happy with. This is why the Keep Sunday Special campaign in the UK gets as much of its support from the trade union movement as it does from the churches. As to why it should be a Sunday, why pick another day except out of spite?\n \n I think religious people have as much right to participate in the political process as anyone else, and I don't think you can exclude one set of political ideas because you dislike the source of them. You have to work on defeating the ideas themselves. If you want to oppose a ban on abortion, you have to demontrate the harm it will do, you can't just dismiss the views of others because you think they're irrational. Few political opinion are rational, they're all a result of core beliefs that may or may not be religious in character. Belief in free markets, or command economics, or historical inevitability, or human rights, or free speech, or democracy, or any number of other political ideas are all largely axiomatic. For most people who use them, they are totemic assumptions, not intended to be challenged. The problem come, both for religious and non-religious people, when the political opinions built on these ideas become themselves axiomatic. This is what seems to have happened in American politics. \"A woman's right to choose\" and \"Abortion is [legally] murder\" have become such fixed positions that there is no room for debate and discussion. This is why clauses about the mother's life being in danger get beaten out of any restrictions, and why there is massive opposition to a time restriction on abortions. Compare with the UK, where abortion is not a political issue. Abortion is allowed up to a certain point, to protect the life and health (including mental health) of the mother, and beyond that to save the life of the mother. This law wouldn't satisfy either extreme in the US, and it doesn't in the UK, but it is roughly where public opinion, mostly secular, is.\n Good points and I'll let it slide for now... I don't have the mental energy right now to nit pick it apart. Later, maybe. ;) But, I will coment on this:\n \n \nEDIT: with regard to the disciples, they were human, with human failings. There was also this little thing called Pentecost, where they got a bit of a helping hand. Plus, Jesus forgave them, the least we can do is to do the same. Besides, if you were falsifying your story, as you claim Peter did, wouldn't you want to leave out the bits that make you look like an untrustworthy, faithless simpleton?\n\n \n I don't claim Peter falsified his story. I'm not convinced that someone named Peter actually wrote the story...and, possible proof that he didn't, is your observation that if he had, he wouldn't have made himself (and the others) look like fools\n Besides, even though you said you don't believe it, the bible is supposed to be the infallable WoG.\n But, this is not the only part of the bible that doesn't make sense, is it? ;)\n \n The fact remains, the disciples of Jesus were untrustworthy slackers. Why on Earth would I believe what they say to be the truth? I don't.",

   "Well, I just came across another of your replies in another thread...\n \nGod wants us to reject the world (indeed at our baptism we are enjoined \"to fight valiantly as a disciple of Christ, against sin, the world and the Devil), to strive against the evil in it, and look for the coming of His kingdom on earth. That doesn't mean loyalty to earthly kingdoms (or republics for that matter), it means engaging with and remaking the government to build a society that works on Christian lines. For example we look to the disciples, who kept a common purse, and the early church, who gave what they had and in return received what they needed - from each according to his means and to each according to his need is a fundamentally Christian idea.\n\n \n This seems to contradict what you said here:\n \n \nI was listing areas of controversy within the church. I'm in favour of women and gay men who are called to be priests being ordained. How God expects gay people to behave is not my problem, as I'm not gay, but I find it hard to believe that He would make people gay and then forbid them to act on the emotions and feelings He gave them. \n I think you are confused about what the bible says about homosexuals. Let me help you understand: What does the Bible say about homosexuality? | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry\n According to the vows you took at your baptism, gay people are your problem and you are \"to fight valiantly as a disciple of Christ, against sin, the world and the Devil\".\n \n \nAbortion, IVF and contraception all deal with fundamental questions on what life is and whether life is valuable in itself. I have no problem with contraception or IVF, on abortion I would rather it didn't happen, but I'm never going to find myself in the situation of having an unwanted pregnancy and I'm not prepared to enforce my own morality on those people who do.\n Again, you are \"to fight valiantly as a disciple of Christ, against sin, the world and the Devil\". So, by not forcing your own morality on others, you are in violation of your baptismal vows.\n \n Btw, in brief, my opinion on whether or not abortion is murder goes something like this: An embryo or fetus is comparable to a fertilized chicken egg (at an age that it is not completely developed and unable to live on it's own, unaided) - it is neither an egg or a chicken but, something in between. Same for an undeveloped human embryo.\n I had the unpleasant experience of seeing my ruptured tubal pregnancy on ultrasound in the emergency room. While I was devestated about losing the potential 'baby' I realized it was not a baby. That image will always be with me. :((I had this happen twice. The second time, the doctor asked permission to take photographs for a medical journal.)\n \n \nAs for how I determine what is right or wrong - a mixture of things. I start from the two commandments that Jesus said were most important, loving God and loving my neighbour, look at what the rest of the Bible says in the light of modern understanding of how people and society work, and how the church has traditionally interpreted that; and trust that God will guide me to the right decision - listening for what the Quakers and others call the \"still small voice\" of God.\n And again, you are to \"to fight valiantly as a disciple of Christ, against sin, the world and the Devil\". So, by making a decision based partly on how modern society works, you are once again in violation.emoticon_ic \n \n \nThis is where we come to a disagreement. Having a shared day of rest is beneficial to everyone in society, it gives families time together and helps reduce overwork and stress. It reduces the ability of employers to force staff to work beyond what they are happy with. This is why the Keep Sunday Special campaign in the UK gets as much of its support from the trade union movement as it does from the churches. As to why it should be a Sunday, why pick another day except out of spite?\n I agree but, that is a labor issue to be decided by the courts and not a church issue to be decided by christians. Or, better yet, let each community decide whether or not they want to shut down all business for a day. emoticon_idea\n \n \nI think religious people have as much right to participate in the political process as anyone else, and I don't think you can exclude one set of political ideas because you dislike the source of them. \n Oh really? What about muslims and their Sharia law? Do you think they have as much right in the political process as a christian? According to you, muslims have just as much right to twist the government to their beliefs as do the christians. See what my point is yet???\n \n \nYou have to work on defeating the ideas themselves. If you want to oppose a ban on abortion, you have to demonstrate the harm it will do, you can't just dismiss the views of others because you think they're irrational.\n Oh yes I can. Irrational people have no business making decisions for the rest of society - that includes those who believe in imaginary gods and have an agenda to create a world based on those beliefs.\n \n \nFew political opinion are rational, they're all a result of core beliefs that may or may not be religious in character. Belief in free markets, or command economics, or historical inevitability, or human rights, or free speech, or democracy, or any number of other political ideas are all largely axiomatic.

   "There is a huge difference in a religious person and a religious zealot and sadly it is the zealots that are destroying the fabric of America. The U.S. was NOT founded on the principles of God. In fact many of the founders were specifically against religion and they made sure when they wrote the constitution that they maintained a separation of church and state. Religious zealots are not capable of thinking for themselves, they only think what will benefit their Faith, their Church, or themselves. If given their way anyone who didn't believe would be burned at the stake. They spread hate, racism, wars, all in the name of their GOD and the man whom they believe was the savior of man. \n \n When this country and in fact the world stops living under a cloud of delusion known as religion then we can finally bring an end to most of the worlds problems. Their GOD sure hasn't done anything in that aspect has he.\n\n \n I think it worth pointing out that the founding fathers were all religious people, they just realized how effective a tool religion could be and were smart enough to remove it from the arsenal of controlling power freaks. The Jefferson Bible does not have 2 pages it represents what TJ thought the message was intended to be and removed what he thought was man making it what he wanted it to be. \n \n Which is the overall problem with religion. Religion needs to be a personal experience on an individual level.

Trickle down economics has never worked under a republican.\n\n \n Horse manure.\n \n Revisiting Liberal Myths &#8211; Reagan and the Deficit\n \n President Reagan entered the White House with an attitude of working honest deals with the Congress on spending. He wanted more defense spending, lower entitlement spending, lower tax rates which would boost the economy (and thus revenues) and seemed to achieve that agreement with Congress in both 1981 and 1982. However, despite getting concessions on taxes, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives never once cut spending, and the actual budgets were higher than what Reagan asked for 7 out of 8 years. This attitude of \"cut spending later\" helped continue the debt trends that began under Ford and Carter. By the end of Reagans terms, debt had increased by $2 trillion. (p.s. Reagan had to rebuild the military that Carter irresponsibly let go down hill)\n \n Actual budget figures in the link below:\n \n The President Reagan Information Page:Budget Myths\n \n The smallest amount by which a Reagan budget was increased by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives was $50 billion. The government shut down on numerous occasions because of budget battles between Reagan and Congress. Interestingly, back then no one blamed the Speaker of the House for shutting down the government. They blamed the President. \n \n When Reagan&#8217;s tax plan was passed in 1982, there were supposed to be two dollars in spending cuts for every dollar of tax cuts. But spending never got cut. In the end, for every new dollar of tax revenue, the Democrats spent $1.80. Rather than cut spending, they let the government shut down and blamed Reagan. \n \n House Atreides - The Truth About Tax Cuts\n \n \nYou need to change the batteries in your calculator.\n\n \n You need to do your homework for a change and quit going to the Barney Franks crowd for your information.\n \n p.s.

   "I'm a conservative, not necessarily a republican, so save your spiel for someone else.\n\n \n Oh so you sometimes vote Democrat? Maybe independent, contribute to the DNC, support some Democratic issues? What is not necessarily a Republican?\n \n Don't feel to bad my views are mostly Republican, but they embarrass me a lot now. They have completely sold out the country and have been taken over by nitwits. The Democrats are better only for the reason their to weak minded to accomplish anything and so their incompetence is not as noteworthy \n \n \nBut the fact of the matter is that your dem gay sex genius Barney Franks was head of the House oversight committee and gave Fannie a clean bill of health. Some oversight.\n\n \n \n No Easy the problem was Bush putting a lot of sugar on to hide the bitter. He caused trade deficits to skyrocket, he pushed deregulation or handcuffed regulators. Sure Fannie and Freddie made a bunch of bad loans, but that so called Clinton push wasn't realized until 2004 when Bush pushed and relaxed restrictions creating competition for Fannie and Freddie with entities they could not really compete with. And if it were the case why did commercial real estate which wasn't part of any of the residential problems suffer as well?\n \n Bush set everybody up and he knew he did. Americans had more debt and less saving then ever. Their assets were all tied to the same things. When the housing market was hit with rising interest rates and resetting ARMs people had nothing to fall back on because their equity evaporated and all the securities were tied to the real estate they were defaulting on. I remember when home loans were 13, 15 20% and home prices were 75 of what they were and people collapsed at a 5 or 7% loan that only increased 1 - 3%. Bush encouraged spend spend spend because it made him and Republicans look good. Notice how right before the crash and during he disappeared. He knew what was going to happen and I really think there was a conscience effort to tank the economy right be fore the election because they knew if they gave the Democrats a sinking ship and then kept punching holes in it by the time the next election and presidential race came up they would landslide and have dominate control again by then the recession would be being controlled and they could stop punching holes fix things and look like heroes. \n \n Read something beside the propaganda and that thing on your shoulder does more than act a place to put your hat.\n Horse manure.\n \n \nRevisiting Liberal Myths - Reagan and the Deficit\n \n President Reagan entered the White House with an attitude of working honest deals with the Congress on spending. He wanted more defense spending, lower entitlement spending, lower tax rates which would boost the economy (and thus revenues) and seemed to achieve that agreement with Congress in both 1981 and 1982. However, despite getting concessions on taxes, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives never once cut spending, and the actual budgets were higher than what Reagan asked for 7 out of 8 years. This attitude of \"cut spending later\" helped continue the debt trends that began under Ford and Carter. By the end of Reagans terms, debt had increased by $2 trillion. (p.s. Reagan had to rebuild the military that Carter irresponsibly let go down hill)\n \n Actual budget figures in the link below:\n \n The President Reagan Information Page:Budget Myths\n \n The smallest amount by which a Reagan budget was increased by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives was $50 billion. The government shut down on numerous occasions because of budget battles between Reagan and Congress. Interestingly, back then no one blamed the Speaker of the House for shutting down the government. They blamed the President. \n \n When Reagan's tax plan was passed in 1982, there were supposed to be two dollars in spending cuts for every dollar of tax cuts. But spending never got cut. In the end, for every new dollar of tax revenue, the Democrats spent $1.80. Rather than cut spending, they let the government shut down and blamed Reagan. \n \n House Atreides - The Truth About Tax Cuts\n \n\n \n Sorry Bud, Trickle Down Economics always made one big assumption that has proven to not be the case. The wealthy who got the breaks didn't put it back into the pot at anywhere near the same rate. All the while Republicans continue to throw money at defense like soldiers should wear it as camo. Keep the nation secure and Military strong, but that isn't what they did. Soldiers getting killed because of substandard issue or their families sending them equipment because Reagan and the Bush's thought financial and physical war were worthwhile. Although believe it or not I thought but for one major instance of bad judgment Bush senior was a good President. \n \n \np.s. It was your drunken-sailor spending democrats who controlled the purse strings the last two years of the Bush Administration. And they never saw a spending program they didn't like, unless it was for defense.\n\n \n Sorry dude the damage was done by then and as I said the Democrats are only better because of how poorly the Republicans have been doing",

For example, faiths that send\n missionaries to dangerous locations can capitalize on the fact\n that people who live in harm's way should already be predisposed\n to believing in God. Seen in this light, it is\n understandable why some religions discourage their members\n from seeking orthodox medical treatment-the more\n harm that comes to them and their family, the more they\n believe. It also makes sense of why religions might encourage\n moralistic explanations for disasters, windfalls, and even\n the creation of the world. The mind of God would seem to\n thrive under such circumstances.'D.M. Wegner",

   "One More Reason Why Liberalism Sucks\n \n David Brooks: Suffering paralysis of the state\n October 13, 2010\n \n Over the decades, governments have become entwined in a series of arrangements that drain money from productive uses and direct it toward unproductive ones. \n \n New Jersey can't afford to build its tunnel, but benefits packages for the state's employees are 41 percent more expensive than those offered by the average Fortune 500 company. These benefits costs are rising by 16 percent a year. \n \n New York City has to strain to finance its schools but must support 10,000 former cops who have retired before age 50. \n \n California can't afford new water projects, but state cops often receive 90 percent of their salaries when they retire at 50. The average corrections officer there makes $70,000 a year in base salary and $100,000 with overtime. (California spends more on its prison system than on its schools.) \n \n States across the nation will be paralyzed for the rest of our lives because they face unfunded pension obligations that, if counted accurately, amount to $2 trillion &#8211; or $87,000 per plan participant. \n \n All in all, governments can't promote future prosperity because they are strangling on their own self-indulgence. \n \n Daniel DiSalvo, a political scientist at City College of New York, has a superb survey of the problem in the new issue of National Affairs. DiSalvo notes that nationally, state and local workers earn on average $14 more per hour in wages and benefits than their private sector counterparts. \n \n This situation, if you'll forgive me for saying so, has been the Democratic Party's epic failure. The party believes in the positive uses of government. But if you want the country to share that belief, you have to provide a government that is nimble, tough-minded and effective. That means occasionally standing up to the excessive demands of public employee unions. \n \n David Brooks: Suffering paralysis of the state | News for Dallas, Texas | Dallas Morning News | Opinion: Viewpoints\n \n When you vote for Obama and his cronies, you're voting for more of the same with the unions. No way Obama & Company are going to, or able to, control their pensions, etc.\n \n IMO it's just liberal imbeciles who are blind, and the uninformed, who continue to vote for that madness. Go ahead, bankrupt the country, yo-yo's. The states are already there.\n \n (they never learn)",

   "I've never known anyone so ignorant ... You EZ take the prize . Bush's War is what put us in this mess, if you don't realize that then you are as dumb as a box of rocks.\n\n \n Liberals have two very serious character flaws. The first is an almost intense lack of ability to grasp the obvious. The second is, even once they know that their back is to the wall, they would rather surrender than fight. They just don&#8217;t have the stomach for freedom.\n \n We all know these folks well. We went to school with them. They were the folks with their underwear pulled over their heads. They were the folks that never made the sports team. They were the kids peeking out from behind the teachers skirt on the playground. Nothing has changed for them since then&#8230; They&#8217;re almost lovable, but they are not reliable in a fox hole.\n \n They are older, but no wiser now and no more ready to defend themselves than they were in school. They desire peace more than freedom itself and they will happily relinquish one in exchange for the other to avoid any threat of a fight... \n \n They are our best talkers. They can nuance their way through even the most complex of issues because talk is what they do best. They can twist or invent facts as needed, on the fly. For a while, it can work. But only until their nuanced position leaves them trapped in a corner. Once trapped in their own web of lies and cowardice, they collapse like a five dollar tent in a tornado.\n \n Today, liberals remain no less committed to their appeasement policies of the past. They remain entirely convinced that Islamic terrorists, and the regimes that breed and support them in the Middle East, can be negotiated with and talked into harmonious peace.\n \n Liberals love and trust the UN, not because it has a track record of resolving international conflicts, it doesn&#8217;t. They love and trust it because they must. They still need someone to watch over them and internationally speaking, the UN is their nanny of choice.\n \n Nothing has changed for liberals and it isn&#8217;t going to change any time soon.\n \n jb-williams.com\n \n You know, I really loved that one comment from that Williams guy I once referenced, which read:\n \n \"Their (the liberal's) inability to grasp the obvious leads them into that corner every time and once there, once diplomacy has run its course without results, they are out of business.\" \n \n In other words, \"After the appeasing liberals are done with their seemingly endless, hot-air, wind-jamming sessions at the inept and corrupt U.N. - after clinging desperately to the coat tails of Jacques Chirac and Rosie O'Donnell; after all their sophomoric Jane Fonda and Cindy Sheehan surrender rallies and Neville Chamberlain pseudo-peace ploys; and with the bad guys still refusing to budge one iota - they're done. Finis. Game over. That's all there is from the libs, there isn't any more. Not even a lethal dose of Viagra can possibly get them to stand up now. All that&#8217;s left for them is to go home, wring their hands, and wait for the WMD&#8217;s to come crashing down on their Greenpeace-utopian fantasyland. \n \n I'm also reminded of the John Kerry appeasers, who wouldn't even stand up to Saddam Hussein in the first Gulf War. If they had their way then, Saddam would not only still be raping and murdering people in Kuwait, but probably in Saudi Arabia as well. And, of course, I also recall the appeasement liberals protesting against going to war in Afghanistan to root out the Taliban and Al Queda - the latter of whom murdered 3,000 of our fellow Americans. They'd still be there too, in greater numbers than present, with their Jihad terrorist camps pumping out new bad guys, had not one courageous President blown them away.\n \n p.s. Harry Reid said the war in Iraq was lost. Obama wanted to do the usual liberal trick and turn tail and run like a yellow coward. They were wrong. And you supported those numbskulls.\n \n Dumb.
