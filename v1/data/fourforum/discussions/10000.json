I have stopped defending the president. But, this irrefutable proof has not led to impeachment. I would not question queen Pelosi's and Harry Reid's state of readiness to take any opporitunity to disgrace and remove the man. Thus, my skepticism concerning irrefutable proof.\n\n \n \n On #1 I think we can agree. The sexual offense was, IMO, not that severe. Even the relatively simple lie that he told to begin with was not that big a deal. The coverup that went along with it was, IMO, the biggie. The Clinton Administration, apparently acting on the direct orders of Bill Clinton, violated multiple federal laws and turned the office of the president into a joke and for WHAT? At least when Nixon did it he was trying to cover up something important (he tried to fix an election). When clinton did it he was trying to cover up some hanky panky with his junior staff...essentially a nothing thing. \n \n On #2, I disagree. IMO, impeachment should have been MUCH more common than it has been. Lew Rockwell writes and interesting article about this in American Conservative magazine that covers it well (the office of the presidency and impeachment was covered extremely well in federalist #69).\n \n http://www.amconmag.com/2007/2007_04_23/article2.html\n \n \nYes, said Hamilton, the president is commander in chief of the military. But this power is only \"occasional\": when the legislature has authorized the military for actual service. He has no power to declare war or to raise and regulate armies. All these powers \"appertain to the legislature.\" Finally, he reminds us, if any powers are abused-such as the power of pardon-the president can be impeached immediately. \n \n One gathers from these passages a vision of the president as a temporary manager, doing only what the legislature approves, always under the relentless threat of impeachment. Presidents would come and go, and they would be in fear of the legislature. One misstep and they could be tossed out. Oh, and by the way, the president can't get rid of the legislature except in one narrow case: he can adjourn them when they otherwise can't agree on how or when to leave. \n\n \n Besides Clinton, there has only ever been one other US president impeached...Andrew Johnson. He was impeached for attempting to remove his secretary of war from office without congressional approval. Talk about a nothing offense...but he was impeached for it.\n \n For the vast majority of our nations history, our presidents have walked a damn thin line. Up until WWII, the office of the president did not hold much by way of real power. What are the presidents constitutional powers? He can negotiate commercial agreements and treaties and welcom ambassadors. Everything else was subject to senate oversight. Even the treaties he negotiated were subject to ratification by the senate. The other real power of the presidency, that he was CIC of the military, was absolutly worthless for most of our nations history because there WAS no military to speak of. Our founders had strong feelings about standing armies and the negative effect they have, and for the vast majority of this nations history those concerns were considered valid. It was not until after WWII that we actually kept a standing military with significant offensive capability. Up until then we mostly kept defensive forces. \n \n Since WWII, the presidents office has gained considerable power with the maintenance of a standing, offensive military. We have also seen expansion in executive power in other areas...ALWAYS during wartime (or \"police action\" time if you prefer). \n \n As far as point #3 goes, the president is FAR too useful to the democrats to impeach him. Nobody with any brains at all can possibly believe that the situation in Iraq will have improved notably before 2008. Even our own military commanders are telling us that. Currently, the war in Iraq is bushs war...the republican war. As long as they keep it that way, it will give the democrats substantial leverage come election time. American voters are WELL aware of the fact that the Republicans in congress backed Bush unconditionally in the war, and that they share responsibility for the mess. \n \n After Pelosi made her \"No impeachment\" promise, a lot of people were absolutly shocked. There is AMPLE evidence for an impeachment. As that unraveled, it became pretty clear that the REASON the democrats are not willing to push an impeachment through is that it appears that FAR too many republicans would be willing to support it. Currently the Democrats have control of congress, and would like to increase that control. The odds are heavily in their favor for taking the white house in 2008 (considered a foregone conclusion by many analysts). The VERY LAST thing they need is to push impeachment against the president and have republican congressmen coming out of the woodwork supporting impeachment...thus showing tha they are willing and able to do what it takes to hold one of their own accountable. Right now, elected republicans everywhere are basically closely associated with Bushs failed war, torture policies, illegal wiretapping, and distain for civil liberties. An impeachment proceeding would be a godsend tot he republican party because it would give them a very definate, very public venue to stand up and seperate themselves from the president.",
