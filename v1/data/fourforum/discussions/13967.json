   "The Daily Beacon\n \n \nThe University of Tennessee's newly announced policy banning all gun ownership by student-athletes is an extreme overreaction to the criminal acts of a few.\n \n UT's athletic director, Mike Hamilton, said that under the new policy, the university will automatically dismiss any student-athlete found in possession of a gun - even those with permits and even those living off-campus. This over-reaching policy prevents law-abiding UT student-athletes from hunting and engaging in recreational and competitive shooting. More importantly, it also prohibits them from owning a firearm for self-defense, a right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.\n \n Let's be very clear - anyone, student-athlete or otherwise, who commits a serious crime ought to be punished. But the law-abiding should not, period.\n \n Sports teach everyone that actions have consequences. Sloppy work in practice leads teams to defeat. Criminal acts lead to punishment. A quality team - on and off the court or field - is what Vol fans want. That is not achieved by depriving students - athletes or not - of their civil rights.\n\n \n There's absolutely no way in hell this could be legal in any sense. That California school got ***** slapped for expelling a student who had a gun off campus, beyond the jurisdictional reach of the school. So how can this school believe they can get away with such an insane policy?",

It's not teaching students to be \"responsible\", it's illegally and wrongfully denying a target group of students the right to own a legitimate item that the Bill of Rights says you can own. Not only is this policy wrong, but it's an infringement on Student Rights and shouldn't even be tolerated.\n \n Your idea of \"responsibility\" is BS.
