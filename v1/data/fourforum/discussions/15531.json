   "Good triumphs over evil.\n\n \n This is hardly an example of good triumphing over evil. It is a falsehood to label to entire Kahr Arms company as evil due to the actions of one of their individual workers. This sends no message other than the simple fact that it is far easier and cheaper to settle out of court than to fight a frivolous lawsuit that is without merit.\n \n $600,000 paid over a period of ten or more years, is hardly a massive blow for a company that makes multiple millions of dollars on a yearly basis. With the price of a Kahr series pistol at about $700, depending on the specific model, this is hardly a large payout to make to a grieving family.\n \n This case was hardly about safety, it was purely political rhetoric. Simply because property was stolen from the manufacturer's plant doesn't mean they are guilty of any real measure of negligence. There are many other examples of stolen property leading to deaths and injuries because of the product's misuse, but nobody has seen fit to file suit against these companies simply because they don't manufacture firearms.\n \n Activist judges choosing to ignore federal law barring frivolous lawsuits is not the same as \"the courts have ruled repeatedly that victims in these cases have the right to a remedy.\"\n \n Simply because legal firearms are acquired through criminal means does not mean the firearm manufacturing companies are to blame.

You&#8217;re thinking this is just another mis-titled ATF Death Watch post. No no no. The missing guns in question here aren&#8217;t the ones the feds intentionally &#8220;lost&#8221; to the Me-hi-can cartels. No, these are federal employee duty guns that &#8211; oopsie! &#8211; just seem to have gone missing. Left in bathrooms, on car trunks&#8230;whatever. So let&#8217;s see&#8230;\n \n Between 2006 and 2008, excluding guns that were stolen, the busy little bees at DHS lost &#8211; actually lost &#8211; 179 guns. That&#8217;s about 60 each year. Or more than one a week.\n \n The FBI? They&#8217;ve had their problems, too. Between 2002 and 2005, they mislaid 160 or 40 a year. Not as big a &#8216;shrinkage&#8217; rate as DHS, but not chopped liver, either.\n \n And both agencies have grown significantly in the last few years. One can only guess how many guns have tumbled down the rabbit hole since the government really began growing like topsy in 2008.\n \n There are about 100,000 FFLs in the US. Three guesses what the consequences of this would be if any 1,000 of them lost guns at rates approaching that of DHS and the FBI.\n \n Look, stuff happens. These are people we&#8217;re dealing with, after all. No one expects them to be perfect. These are public employees, after all.\n \n What&#8217;s so galling, though, is that the same faceless bureaucracies that demand such uncompromising high standards from private sector gun dealers and owners &#8211; and that won&#8217;t flinch at revoking concealed carry or even ownership rights &#8211; can&#8217;t seem to uphold those same standards themselves.\n \n Kahr Arms has lost only 50 weapons in five years?Not much of a comparison is it.http://thetruthaboutguns.com/2011/07/daniel-zimmerman/kahr-agrees-to-600000-record-settlement-over-stolen-gun/",

All that is being sought is an end to frivolous and baseless lawsuits against companies who have done nothing wrong. That is truly the extent of this case. This is not about political or judicial activism. This is not about conservatism or liberalism. What this is about is justice.\n \n \nShould persons who believe that they have been injured as a result of tortuous conduct by the gun industry be deprived of their rights to have the courts determine whether the law entitles them to compensation? Or should legislatures prohibit the courts from determining whether allegedly negligent gun sellers and manufacturers should be liable under the common law?\n\n \n What a person may feel they are entitled to is not relevant to the discussion of this topic. No person possesses a right to file a civil suit against a company on the basis of their product being misused in a criminal fashion. No person is legally entitled to anything simply because they think they deserve it. One does not get something on the basis of wanting it.\n \n Perhaps you could supply us with an argument of legal basis for why a manufacturer should be subjected to a civil suit because their product was acquired through criminal means from any one of a number of different sources, for the sole purpose of furthering a criminal action at some point down the line. The manufacturer did not sell directly to the criminal, they did not make the product available to the criminal, they did not violate business standards. All they did was produce the product and make it available to the general population through licensed distributors.\n \n A company cannot be held liable for the felonious misuse of their product.

   "Concerning the unconstitutionality of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA):\n \n \"Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment guarantee a right to a remedy for injuries to life, liberty, and/or property rights. United States Supreme Court has recognized that laws that eliminate common law causes of action may violate due process. In Poindexter v Greenhow, the Court held, 'it is not within the powers of the state to deny a person all redress for a deprivation of rights secured by the constitution and that to take away the remedy is to take away the right itself.' Poindexter v. Greenhow, 114 U.S. 270 (1885). Under the PLCAA gun manufacturers would not have any responsibility for forseeable harm caused by negligence in producing and distributing weapons and those harmed, past, present, and future would be wholly without a remedy in state or federal court. Under the Fifth Amendment, the City had a substantial, protectable interest in its tort claim. Inherent in the Due Process Clause, is a 'separate and distinct right to seek judicial relief for some wrong.' Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403 (2002). It is acknowledged that Congress may regulate remedies or even state court remedies. Due Process is violated when Congress abolishes an existing remedy and provides no alternative. To deprive the City of its right in interest deprives the City of a vested cause of action without just compensation; thereby the PLCAA is violative of the Due Process Clause and, therefore, unconstitutional.\"\n (City of Gary v.

   "Concerning the unconstitutionality of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA):\n\n \n The case you cited does not appear to be a Supreme Court case but rather a lower court case ruling for the state of Indiana. The case of City of Gary v Smith & Wesson was ruled on in 2002, three years before the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act was signed into law. This case was also initially dismissed because the plaintiffs failed to show sufficient reason under which relief may be granted.\n \n The case itself seems to go against what you claim. City of Gary v. Smith & Weson Corp. - Indiana Personal Injury Lawyers\n \n The common law requirements for public nuisance claims in Indiana are very clear. First, public nuisance claims must arise from an unreasonable use of property. Deller vs. Hofferberth, 26 N.E. 889 (Ind. 1 1), or a violation of a specific statute, Whittington vs. State of Indiana, 669 N.E.2d 1363 (Ind. 1996). Second, to be liable for a public nuisance, one must be in control of the offending item or activity at the time of injury to plaintiff. See, e.g. Brown vs. Powell, 176 N.E. 241, 243 (Ind.Ct.App. 1931). Third, because public nuisance describes a form of harm rather than a free-standing tort theory of liability, plaintiffs must plead an actionable basis in tort for such a claim. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 821B, cmt. e. Fourth, a legislative body cannot authorize conduct on one hand, and seek to punish it through public nuisance actions on the other, particularly where a comprehensive regulatory scheme already governs the challenged conduct. Sopher vs. State, 81 N.E. 913 (Ind. 1907). Plaintiff's Complaint does not satisfy any of these requirements. Plaintiff's Complaint fails to bring the City's public nuisance claim within the limits set by Indiana common law.\n \n \n \nArguing that it need not plead an underlying tort in order to claim relief for the harm produced by a public nuisance, the City departs once again from common law, which requires that a defendant's interference with a public right involve conduct which is \"intentional or unintentional and otherwise actionable under the principles controlling liability for negligent or reckless conduct or for abnormally dangerous activities.\" Restatement \u00a7 821B, cmt. e. In other words, public nuisance claims must arise from conduct which is actionable, not merely any conduct for which liability would not otherwise lie, as plaintiff proposes.\n\n \n \nIndiana common law likewise prohibits the City's public nuisance claim here because defendants' commercial activities are legislatively authorized and extensively regulated. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 821B, cmt. f; Sopher, 81 N.E. at 915. Under an umbrella of statutes and regulations, the United States Congress, the Indiana legislature, and Gary have each authorized the lawful distribution, ownership and sale of firearms of specific styles to federally licensed commercial entities - precisely the activity the City now seeks to declare a nuisance.\n \n The City misstates Indiana law, claiming that defendants owe a duty of care to the City, because harm to the City caused by the criminal misuse of firearms is foreseeable. Indiana law supports the imposition of a duty of care to avoid foreseeable injuries to foreseeable victims only where the defendant has a relationship with the plaintiff that gives rise to a duty to protect the plaintiff from such injuries or, in the absence of such a relationship, where the defendant has actual control over the instrumentality which caused the harm. Ebbingham, 693 N.E.2d at 648; Whitten v. Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp., 570 N.E.2d 1353,1356 (Ind.Ct.App. 1991); Helmchen, 685 N.E. 2d at 181.\n\n \n \nThe City's failure to warn claim is equally flawed. In an attempt to maintain its otherwise deficient claim, the City reconfigures its argument, stating that defendants have not adequately warned buyers about the non-obvious dangers posed by firearms. The City cannot evade the allegations of its own Complaint, which - because of its aggregated nature - seeks to impose liability for failing to warn of the open and obvious dangers associated with firearms, as well as of the dangers of intentional and criminal misuse. In Indiana, a duty to warn of a product's risks extends only to those who can reasonably be assumed to be ignorant of the risks that a warning would illuminate. Senco Prod. Inc. vs. Riley, 434 N.E.2d 561, 570 (Ind.Ct.App. 1982). Moreover, the duty to warn assumes that there is a hidden defect in the product such that the danger created by the defect is not open or obvious to all. See Bemis Co. v. Rubush, 427 N.E.2d 1058, 1061, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 825 (1982). There is no such basis for such an assumption here, in light of the City's aggregated claims which seek liability on the basis of intentional as well as accidental shootings. Accordingly, the City's failure to warn claim should be dismissed.\n\n \n Under the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act a manufacturer or distributor may be sued, but only if they are found to have exercised negligence when dealing with a product with serious design flaws that would make it unsafe, such as firing when the trigger isn't pulled. However they may not be sued if a legal product is acquired in an illegal fashion, by an individual who can't legally own said product, and uses it to commit criminal actions such as assault and murder.",

   "What evidence do you have that there is no basis for being sued for \"public nuisance, negligent sales, and negligent design\" in American law?\n\n \n Because of reading the case of City of Gary v Smith & Wesson. It makes many, many mentions of how the city of Gary attempted to claim up to 18 manufacturers, 6 dealers and numerous distributors, were responsible were any and all shootings within the city under the claim of product liability. This claim was even addressed specifically within the court case:\n \n \nThe City attempts to aggregate all shootings, including accidental and intentional shootings, as a basis for its product liability claim. &#8194; By doing so, the City seeks to hold defendants absolutely liable for injuries sustained through any use of firearms, even where the firearms are misused and/or deliberately operated to cause intentional injury. &#8194; Neither Indiana nor any other court has adopted such a radical departure from product liability law.\n\n \n No.?45A03-0105-CV-155. - CITY OF GARY KING v. SMITH WESSON CORP 225 - IN Court of Appeals\n \n As I have said these lawsuits are frivolous on the basis of trying to hold manufacturers responsible for the criminal misuse of their product.\n \n There is also a substantial bit of information regarding the lawsuit in the negligence section of the claim:\n \n \nThe City also brought suit against all Appellees for negligent marketing, distribution, sale, and failure to warn, and brought suit against manufacturer Appellees for negligent design. &#8194; Specifically, the City alleged that Appellees' &#8220;conduct is negligent and [that they have] breached their duty of care to [the City] and its citizenry by creating and supplying and supporting an illegitimate secondary market for handguns &#8228; by failing to exercise reasonable care in [the] marketing, manufactur[e,] &#8228; distribution[,] and sale of their handguns.&#8221; &#8194; Appellant's App. at 32. &#8194; The City also alleged that &#8220;[a]ll [Appellees] further violated their duty by negligently designing, manufacturing, distributing, and/or selling guns with inadequate, incomplete, or nonexistent warnings regarding the risks of harm of the product[.]&#8221; &#8194;Id. at 34.\n \n The City alleged that &#8220;manufacturer [Appellees] specifically violated [their duty to [the City] to act in a reasonably prudent manner in regards to the design of their handguns] by designing guns which they knew or should have known did not have adequate safety devices[.]&#8221; &#8194;Id. The City further claimed that\n \n [a]s a direct and proximate result of [Appellees'] aforesaid negligent intentional and wrongful acts and omissions, the handguns manufactured, distributed and sold by [Appellees] have damaged [the City] and harmed its citizenry, thereby causing [the City] to incur substantial expenses for police and other law enforcement services, rescue services, emergency medical services and other emergency services, pension benefits, disability benefits, workers' compensation benefits, health care, jail costs, increased security and other services in public facilities and other necessary facilities and services due to the threat of or actual use of the [Appellees'] handguns.\n\n \n And then there is this interesting quote from the court, specifying that manufacturers and dealers owe no duty of care to the city because of misuse of a legal product:\n \n \nAs previously mentioned, none of the Appellees have close relationships with the City, and public policy clearly favors the availability of handguns. &#8194; We conclude that these two factors substantially outweigh foreseeability, even though we recognize that it is reasonably foreseeable that the City will incur costs related to the misuse of handguns in the City.19 We therefore conclude that none of the Appellees owes a duty of care to the City. Absent a duty, there can be no negligence. &#8194; Thus, we must affirm the trial court's dismissal of the City's negligence claims against all Appellees.\n\n \n The crux of the argument, negligent design, seems to focus on this single issue:\n \n \nSome of these allegations involve dangers that are not open and obvious, such as the risk that a handgun could be fired even with the ammunition magazine removed. &#8194; A manufacturer or retailer may be liable for selling a product without warning of a latent danger in its design or use. &#8194;Koske v. Townsend Engineering Co., 551 N.E.2d 437, 440 (Ind.1990).\n\n \n That a handgun may be fired with the magazine removed is in no way a design flaw or a dangerous oversight. This has been a feature to the design since the beginning of the 20th century, if not even before. This is not a danger but rather a fact of design, because there is no reason to change the design to make this act impossible to achieve.\n \n If you wish to cite a case such as City of Gary v Smith & Wesson it would be best to read through the entire case first before attempting to cite any specific portion of it. \n \n The fact that Smith & Wesson was the sole party defendant after all was said and done, doesn't lend much credibility to the charges themselves. 17 out of 18 manufacturers were dropped from the suit, even though some of the manufacturers are responsible for firearms that are termed \"Saturday Night Specials.\"",

   "What if your child found your gun and started playing with it and got their head blown off because it didn't have a trigger lock? Wouldn't you want to sue the manufacturer?\n\n \n If your child shot and/or killed themselves with your personally owned firearm, precisely what responsibility would the manufacturer hold in the matter? They did not directly sell you a loaded firearm, nor did they do anything to hide the potentially lethal nature of the firearm. There is no legal basis for suing any particular manufacturer under such circumstances. The only one who could reasonably be charged with anything would be you directly because you owned it and failed to secure it in a manner the courts determined to be \"proper\" in this matter.\n \n If you believe a trigger lock is so important then it is of no consequence that you buy one yourself. It is not an unreasonable step to take if you truly wish for it to be equipped on your gun for the protection of your child.\n \n \nGuns are a lot more powerful nowadays so I think more safety devices are needed.\n\n \n Firearms are a lot safer nowadays than they used to be back during the time you believe they were \"less powerful.\" However negligence on the part of the owner or operator makes even the most safe of products dangerous. There is no reason for the manufacturer to attempt and make a product -one that is known to be lethal when misused- in such a way that even reckless negligence would prevent it from being used improperly.\n \n Your argument of \"guns are a lot more powerful nowadays\" is also irrelevant to whatever discussion you may take part in, as has been pointed out numerous times. A .357 Magnum or larger is not necessary for dying from a shot to the head. Any firearm, even of weak .17 caliber, would be sufficient to do the job and undercut the crux of your argumentative status. \n \n Even in the day of colonial muzzle loaders and flintlocks there existed rifles fully capable of killing an elephant. For example I submit the 2 bore firearm. It is essentially a single man portable, shoulder fired cannon, with a projectile that weighs half a pound. The foot/pounds of energy generated by it exceed even the .50 BMG cartridge that so many gun control activists seek to demonize. http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2009/09/17/a-mighty-2-bore-muzzleloader/",

This case was remanded for further proceedings.\"\n \n Since the Indiana Supreme Court ruled the claims of the city were valid why are you quoting what a lower court (an Indiana Court of Appeals) said about the issue?",

First of all Xenamnes has done a marvelous job dispatching your argument so nothing further needs to be said by me on that front. \n \n However the question needs to be asked and pointed out that, you think the maker of a lawful product could and should be sued every time a criminal misuses it.

Why can&#8217;t we be sued if we follow Your Scam? According to you, it is Constitutional, so why not sue everybody till everything is gone. Or is that where this eventually goes?

It doesn&#8217;t! \n \n Not to mention the 900 thousand times a year, (Something the Anti Researchers admitted to in the NAS studies) a firearm is used in a Defensive Gun Use (DGU). Can we sue the Brady&#8217;s and VPC etc. every time a gun is used in a lawful DGU? Or how about if we sue them every time a gun isn&#8217;t allowed in a situation?

   "What the city proposes is unConstitutional just like you hobbit gun grabbers. You break law to make law as unConstitutional as that is and try to grab more terrorist power any way possible. You call good...evil and evil....good. You have no concept of right or wrong and no concept of rights, due process nor powers of the several branches of government. None have any power to infringe on an unAlieanable right!!!!!!!!!!!!\n \n \n \nBills of attainder and ex post facto laws\n \n Let us now turn to the prohibitions against bills of attainder and ex post facto laws. Established precedents tend to define these terms narrowly. These precedents are confusing, incomplete, and do not reflect all the rights the mandates were meant to insure. They come from isolated unrelated cases. They may have even served to detract from the rights the mandates were meant to preserve because they only reflect portions of what a bill of attainder actually is.\n \n From English law a punishment less than death without a trial is considered to be a bill of pains and penalties, so one of the issues is to determine whether the phrase \"bill of attainder\" in the Constitution includes the \"bill of pains and penalties\" as well.\n \n To establish what a bill of attainder really is requires some research and reflection. One researcher has summarized the definitions in the various sources and precedents: \"A bill of attainder is a law, or legal device, used to outlaw people, suspend their civil rights, confiscate their property, put them to death, or [otherwise] punish them without a trial.\"[16]\n \n In spite of the limited methodology used for determining what is, and what is not a bill of attainder, some elements are:\n \n A. A bill of attainder proper is the administration of death without a trial.\n \n B. Any punishment without trial is a bill of attainder under the doctrine of inclusion of \"pains and penalties.\"\n \n C. Bills of attainder can include any legislative act which takes away life, liberty, or property. (This concept is mostly ignored by courts and legislatures.)\n \n D. Bills of attainder can apply to specifically named individuals or easily ascertainable groups (including the group of everyone).\n \n One of the greatest hazards of bringing a bill of attainder case is one cannot count on the court to support any of the concepts above. In cases where Article I mandates are addressed, the courts sometimes respond to Article III mandates instead. Most courts avoid the issue.\n \n A criminally prohibited act can be malum in se, an actual injury to someone, or malum prohibitum, which is normally justified as an attempt to prevent injury. But opening legislation to preventive measures is dangerous. Punishing people for their past offenses can be justified as prevention of future crimes, and past crimes are indeed usually the best predictors of future crimes, but when legislators try to use acts other than crimes as predictors of crimes, and prohibit those alleged predictive acts, they are disabling the right of the people to engage in such acts for innocent purposes.\n \n Preventive legislation was not unknown to the Founders, but most of their criminal legislation presumed an act which was an injury to a victim. The difficulty with preventative statutory prohibitions is that they involve disablement of everyone's rights on a theory of causation that may not be valid, and may have unintended consequences that are worse than the intended ones. The prohibition of alcohol by constitutional amendment was a classic failure of this kind, and the present \"war on drugs\" seems to be another one. All too often the predictors chosen are weak or dubious causes of the evil the measure seeks to avoid, and are beneficial in other ways that may greatly exceed the hazards. However, the predictors are too often dramatic in their adverse effects, but diffuse in their beneficial effects, misleading public policy to focus anecdotally on the harm while ignoring the benefits.\n \n Although historically bills of attainder have sometimes imposed punishment legislatively for past acts which may have already been prohibited as crimes, or acts not prohibited as crimes when committed, which would be make them ex post facto laws, some have been justified as preventive, and sought to avoid political opposition by being imposed on a minority class or faction out of power. This would make bills of attainder the legislative equivalent of civil injunctive or mandamus relief, but without the trouble and expense of the plaintiff proving he would be injured if the relief sought is not granted. If done for alleged past acts that were crimes, it is disablement of public rights without due process of law, but if preventive, it is disablement of public rights for possible future acts, and that is in clear conflict with the purpose of government being the protection of rights. Rights may sometimes conflict and need to be balanced, but actual rights must be balanced against actual rights. It does not work to disable actual rights to prevent possible future infringements of rights that may never occur.\n \n The linking of ex post facto laws and bills of attainder to criminal actions fails to consider that the purpose of these provisions is protection of the rights of defendants, and it matters little, except perhaps to the reputation of the defendant, whether the action is called \"civil\" or \"criminal\" if the right sought to be disabled is the same. A competency hearing that seeks to confine the defendant to a mental institution is a petition to disable the liberty of the defendant, and as such must be accorded the same due process protections that a \"criminal\" action would have that sought to imprison the defendant. For the defendant there is little difference between confinement in a mental institution and confinement in a penal institution.\n \n These considerations also open the question of the constitutionality of punitive damages in civil cases. They imply that such punitive damages are necessarily of a character that requires criminal due process. There is no constitutional prohibition against combining civil and criminal cases in a single action, but punitive damages must be imposed by a unanimous verdict of a jury of twelve, based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt, with all the due process protections of criminal trials.\n \n \n - HT Constitutionlist Society",

   "Since the Indiana Supreme Court ruled the claims of the city were valid why are you quoting what a lower court (an Indiana Court of Appeals) said about the issue?\n\n \n Even though it is the Supreme Court of Indiana, in context it is still a lower court ruling and has no say over matters concerning federal law. A state Supreme Court does not have the authority to overturn a federal law or set policy for the rest of the country. This case can only set policy if it is appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, heard by said court, and ruled on by said court in a manner similar to the case of McDonald v Chicago.\n \n The Indiana Supreme Court only found that some of the claims by the city of Gary were reasonable and could stand. It rejected several others. Specifically it rejected the claim of proximate cause and comparative fault, the claim of market share liability, the claim of negligence per se, the claim of damage for harm occurring at the time of sale.\n \n The Indiana Supreme Court has also rejected the claim that the handguns in question were unsafe for sale because they lacked specific features, ruling that it is a matter for trial courts rather than them. Adding to the fact the city of Gary was not the purchaser of the firearms in question and cannot claim harm to the lack of supposed safety features, such as devices that make guns unusable to the registered owner.\n \n No.?45S03-0301-CV-36. - CITY OF GARY KING v. SMITH WESSON CORP - IN Supreme Court\n \n Ultimately the Indiana Supreme Court simply ruled that the city of Gary may continue with its lawsuit at the time, which was before the enactment of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. They didn't specifically rule that Smith & Wesson or any other manufacturer was truly liable for damages incurred through illegal use of their product, only that the city had made a convincing argument to warrant further trial and litigation. It was never stated that the city is entitled to damages, only that they may seek damages.\n \n As stated this is nothing more than a lower court ruling, held before the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act was signed into law. As such it needs to be heard by the Supreme Court to be valid in the context of today. This is further made necessary by the fact that the Indiana Supreme Court specifically stated that they disagree with the findings of liability held by other courts in other states against gun manufacturers and licensed dealers.\n \n The city of Gary alleges that Smith & Wesson and other manufacturers ship firearms to dealers that they know are selling them illegally within the city, and have the authority to change this by not shipping to known corrupt dealers. However this is a false statement. A manufacturer may not stop business with a particularly licensed dealer because of alleged corruption unsubstantiated proof as this would violate the dealer's business rights and subject the manufacturer to lawsuits.\n \n The only way a manufacturer may legally stop shipments to a corrupt dealer is if the corruption charges are proven and sufficient enough that the ATF revoke the dealer's business license, thus making them ineligible for future shipments from the manufacturer.\n \n The city of Gary is also seeking monetary compensation for damages resulting from the illegal use of a legal product by subjecting the manufacturers to lawsuits. However they seem to have no interest in seeking redress from those who are directly responsible for the damages incurred, that being the criminals and prohibited individuals who were actually guilty of the shootings themselves. This detracts from the legitimacy and the credibility of the city's original claim, and instead suggests that outside parties share more responsibility than those directly involved by being in person at the time of the incident.\n \n Further I am uncertain of just what case you cited previously. The above link is directly to the Indiana Supreme Court ruling on City of Gary v Smith & Wesson and nowhere did the court mention the words \"deprive\" or \"unconstitutional\" within their ruling. While this may seem trivial the quoted passage you selected included those two words. What exactly is the nature of the discrepancy?\n \n EDIT\n \n To add further is a section of the quoted passage you selected:\n \n \nIt is acknowledged that Congress may regulate remedies or even state court remedies. Due Process is violated when Congress abolishes an existing remedy and provides no alternative. To deprive the City of its right in interest deprives the City of a vested cause of action without just compensation; thereby the PLCAA is violative of the Due Process Clause and, therefore, unconstitutional.\"\n\n \n Under the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, a manufacturer may still be sued, so the city of Gary is not deprived of action to seek compensation.\n \n Read The Bill: S. 397 [109th] - GovTrack.us\n \n \n(5) QUALIFIED CIVIL LIABILITY ACTION-\n \n (A) IN GENERAL- The term `qualified civil liability action' means a civil action or proceeding or an administrative proceeding brought by any person against a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product, or a trade association, for damages, punitive damages, injunctive or declaratory relief, abatement, restitution, fines, or penalties, or other relief, resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product by the person or a third party, but shall not include--\n \n (i) an action brought against a transferor convicted under section 924(h) of title 18, United States Code, or a comparable or identical State felony law, by a party directly harmed by the conduct of which the transferee is so convicted;\n \n (ii) an action brought against a seller for negligent entrustment or negligence per se;\n \n (iii) an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product knowingly violated a State or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product, and the violation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought, including--\n \n (I) any case in which the manufacturer or seller knowingly made any false entry in, or failed to make appropriate entry in, any record required to be kept under Federal or State law with respect to the qualified product, or aided, abetted, or conspired with any person in making any false or fictitious oral or written statement with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or other disposition of a qualified product; or\n \n (II) any case in which the manufacturer or seller aided, abetted, or conspired with any other person to sell or otherwise dispose of a qualified product, knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer of the qualified product was prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm or ammunition under subsection (g) or (n) of section 922 of title 18, United States Code;\n \n (iv) an action for breach of contract or warranty in connection with the purchase of the product;\n \n (v) an action for death, physical injuries or property damage resulting directly from a defect in design or manufacture of the product, when used as intended or in a reasonably foreseeable manner, except that where the discharge of the product was caused by a volitional act that constituted a criminal offense, then such act shall be considered the sole proximate cause of any resulting death, personal injuries or property damage; or\n \n (vi) an action or proceeding commenced by the Attorney General to enforce the provisions of chapter 44 of title 18 or chapter 53 of title 26, United States Code.\n \n (B) NEGLIGENT ENTRUSTMENT- As used in subparagraph (A)(ii), the term `negligent entrustment' means the supplying of a qualified product by a seller for use by another person when the seller knows, or reasonably should know, the person to whom the product is supplied is likely to, and does, use the product in a manner involving unreasonable risk of physical injury to the person or others.\n\n \n No personal assaults against you or your character have been made. No strawman arguments have been introduced. The use of hyperbole, rhetoric and \"muddying the water\" have not been exercised. The points have been addressed honestly, discrepancies have been pointed out as they have come to light. Further debate and discussion of the facts is merited.",

   "From Paul Helmke's recent testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives, Oversight and Government Reform Committee about the issue:\n \n \"Yet as the six month anniversary of Tucson approaches, we have still seen no change in our nation's weak or non-existent gun laws. We still have no federal law criminalizing gun trafficking, banning assault weapons and magazines, or closing the loopholes in our Brady Background Check system that help arm dangerous killers and supply gun traffickers. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) remains without a confirmed leader and continues to be stymied by laws and Appropriations riders that tie its hands and allow corrupt gun dealers to flagrantly violate the law and keep on selling guns....\n \n \"But federal law allows people without a license to sell guns without a background check....\n \n \"ATF Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the Dallas Field Division, Michael Golson, said of trafficked weapons entering Mexico from the U.S.: 'They're coming from gun shows and flea markets.'...\n \n \"Gun traffickers are able to purchase large quantities of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons and .50 caliber sniper rifles that can penetrate armored car plating and airplanes....\n \n \"Mexican law enforcement is increasingly being out-gunned by drug gangs bearing military-style assault weapons, .50 caliber sniper rifles, and other\n high-powered weapons from the U.S... Mexico Attorney General Medina Mora has said that before the assault weapons ban was allowed to expire, only\n 21 percent of the weapons Mexico seized from traffickers were assault rifles, while today, it is more than half.3...\n \n \"We know how criminals get guns. But we don't give law enforcement the tools to stop them effectively....\n \n \"Corrupt dealers who violate gun laws are specially protected under the law. Instead of letting ATF operate as other law enforcement entities do, ATF is barred from conducting more than one unannounced investigation of any gun dealer each year. So after a dealer has been inspected once, he knows it's unlikely ATF will visit for another year....\n \n \"It is also too difficult to stop corrupt gun dealers from continuing to sell guns, even after they have been found to violate gun laws. To revoke a gun dealer's license, ATF must meet an extraordinary burden of proof, higher than required even in most criminal cases.... Because of this standard, ATF generally requires repeated violations of the law over many years before it attempts to revoke a license. As a result, license revocations are exceedingly rare.\n \n \"And even if ATF succeeds in revoking a license, corrupt gun dealers are allowed to continue to sell guns while their case is on appeal. In fact, gun dealers have been allowed to sell guns even after their licenses have been finally revoked.7 We must stop allowing gun dealers who violate the law to\n continue to do so.\n \n \"We must give ATF the power to track trafficked guns by supporting the proposed rule to require reporting of assault rifle sales along the Mexico border....\n \n \"We strongly oppose legislation like H.R. 1093 being pushed by the gun lobby to make it virtually impossible for ATF to revoke the licenses of law breaking gun dealers....\n \n \"Current law enables gun traffickers and gangs to be supplied with arsenals, placing no limit on the number of guns you can buy in a single purchase....\"\n http://democrats.oversight.house.gov/images/stories/MINORITY/630%20gun%20forum/Paul%20Helmke%20Testimony06302011_PH.pdf\n \n YouTube- Paul Helmke Testimony on Gun Trafficking to Mexico\n\n \n Uh huh, and when Helmke found out it was the corrupt gov't agencies, mainly the ATF he promptly QUIT THE BRADY BUNCH and drifted away into the sunset.\n \n Keep rooting around in the slop though and pretend anything unConstitutional you have to say could have any merit at all. Your submission of already disproven testimony is laughable. You do know the ATF, FBI signed off on gun purchases the FFLs did not want to make. You are full of it.",

As part of society, the gun industry has a duty to act in a way that does not endanger others.\n \n 2) To determine if the gun industry has breached its duty of care that it owes to society, courts use what is known as the reasonable person standard.\n \n \"Tort law measures duty by the reasonable person standard. In determining whether a duty of care has been breached, for example, the courts ask how\n a reasonable person would have acted in the same circumstances.\"\n (from the above link)\n\n \n There are unfortunately parties who would interpret this \"duty\" in very broad terms that can apply in whatever circumstance they choose to use it. This point is not in doubt and has been proven in various other cases.\n \n \nSo what would a reasonable person do in a certain situation to prevent harm from occurring to others? Would a reasonable person distribute defective and hazardous products? I don't think so.\n \n \n This point has already been addressed. In City of Gary v Smith & Wesson the city sued, amongst other reasons, over a lack of what they determined were necessary safety features not being included on the firearms sold within the state. \n \n Among these were features that would render the gun unusable by unauthorized users; a concept otherwise known as \"smart gun technology.\" However such technology does not readily exist and cannot be proven reliable in the real world. It is unfair to hold a manufacturer to unrealistic standards and review and blame them for failing to include devices that don't work. \n \n The other supposed \"safety features\" the city demands would do nothing to prevent criminal use of a firearm, but rather seem to be suited for preventing accidental discharge because the user acted in a blatantly reckless and unsafe manner. In short the devices were sought in order to correct an error on the part of the user rather than the device. No manufacturer owes such a duty to anyone.\n \n A firearm can not be determined as defective simply because it doesn't meet a plaintiff's unreasonable standard of review. The features listed would already prohibit the sale of firearms that various military and police organizations have certified as being suited for their uses after having passed rigorous safety and reliability tests.\n \n As to the hazardous aspect, all firearms are deadly in nature so this would appear a non sequitur. A firearm cannot be manufactured in a way that would make it harmless or unable to cause death if used in an improper manner. A person on trial for manslaughter cannot argue that they believed the gun wasn't loaded, or that the safety was on, or that they didn't mean to shoot the victim.\n \n \nWould a reasonable person require prospective employees to pass a background check before being trusted with deadly weapons?\n\n \n Can it be proven that manufacturers do not already follow this standard?\n \n \nWould a reasonable person continue to supply a certain FFL with guns if there was good reason to believe that this FFL was involved in gun trafficking?\n\n \n Yes actually. For a firearms manufacturer to follow to proscribed business practice would constitute a breach of contract with the FFLs involved and open them up to lawsuits for interfering in their livelihood. As stated previously the only way a manufacturer may legally stop shipments to a corrupt dealer is if the corruption charges are proven and sufficient enough that the ATF revoke the dealer's business license, thus making them ineligible for future shipments from the manufacturer.\n \n America operates on the basis of innocent until proven guilty. Suspicion of misconduct, or reason to believe an illegal act is taking place, are not actual proof of any wrongdoing and cannot be regarded as such because it runs contrary to the legal standard of the country. Manufacturers cannot change the rules of business because somebody somewhere feels something is wrong.\n \n City of Gary v Smith & Wesson provides evidence that a number of licensed dealers were busted in a sting operation, selling firearms to undercover police officers posing as actual buyers and claiming that wouldn't be able to pass the background check. In such a situation where evidence of wrongdoing has been proven then the manufacturer has grounds to terminate their business agreement with them, and the city would have grounds to sue them for distributing to prohibited individuals. In this specific situation the city has a legitimate claim.\n \n \nWould a reasonable person bury their head in the sand and ignore the problem?\n\n \n It has yet to be proven that any manufacturer is truly doing this. See the above point.\n \n \nLet's look at another example to make this point clearer. Suppose a reasonable person who was a pharmacist became aware that a certain pharmacy tech was illegally selling prescription drugs to people who did not have a prescription. Would a reasonable person take no action in that situation? I don't think so.\n\n \n A reasonable person would have the pharmacy tech arrested for such illegal practices once becoming aware of such. As you said \"became aware.\" Becoming aware of such sales in the setting of a pharmacy, discovered by one employee against another, would entail having evidence that could be investigated and proven to have occurred.\n \n However the example does not work the same way with regard to firearms manufacturers and dealers. Only the license holder may make the sales, not their assistants. The manufacturer has no way of analyzing the sales records once the merchandise reaches the dealers and licensed distributors and no way to dictate how they dispose of them since such matters are already governed by federal and state law.\n \n \n3) \"To recover damages (receive compensation), the plaintiff in a tort lawsuit must prove that she or he suffered a legally recognizable injury. In other words, the plaintiff must have suffered some loss, harm, wrong, or invasion of a protected interest.... If no harm or injury results from a given negligent action, there is nothing to compensate-and no tort exists.\"\n (from the above link)\n \n This point is not in doubt. It's obvious that people who have been shot have suffered real harm.\n\n \n This point is in doubt. People who have been shot have suffered real harm. But that harm was suffered at the hands of a criminal individual who had no person's interest in mind except their own at the time of whatever crime they committed, whether it's a mugging, convenience store robbery or drive by shooting. In such a situation it would be the shooter who should be made subject to the tort lawsuit because THEY are the ones who committed the harm, not the manufacturer who made the gun they acquired in an illegal fashion.\n \n \n4) There must be a causal link between the negligence of the defendant and the harm suffered by the plaintiff.\n\n \n The problem lies in just how broadly the \"casual link\" standard is interpreted by the courts. The business practices by the manufacturer and the licensed dealer are already spelled out by federal guidelines. A criminal acquiring a brand name firearm that is sold within the city, through criminal actions, is already operating outside the scope of these federal guidelines and cannot be charged as an unavoidable link in the chain that either legal party has any say over.\n \n \nGun activists have complained about frivolous lawsuits against the gun industry. Are such lawsuits frivolous?\n\n \n Yes they are quite frivolous in nature.\n \n \nI think that is best determined on a case-by-case basis. Each case is different. Let a judge or jury who has heard the specifics of a case determine if it has merit. A blanket ban on lawsuits against a certain industry (with a few narrow exceptions) is not the solution. People who have suffered harm because of negligence by the gun industry should not have their legal rights violated because of the possibility of others misusing the justice system.\n\n \n As said previously there is no blanket ban on lawsuits against the gun industry. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act has an entire section devoted to spelling out circumstances under which a lawsuit may be filed.\n \n Read The Bill: S. 397 [109th] - GovTrack.us\n \n \n(5) QUALIFIED CIVIL LIABILITY ACTION-\n \n (A) IN GENERAL- The term `qualified civil liability action' means a civil action or proceeding or an administrative proceeding brought by any person against a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product, or a trade association, for damages, punitive damages, injunctive or declaratory relief, abatement, restitution, fines, or penalties, or other relief, resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product by the person or a third party, but shall not include--\n \n (i) an action brought against a transferor convicted under section 924(h) of title 18, United States Code, or a comparable or identical State felony law, by a party directly harmed by the conduct of which the transferee is so convicted;\n \n (ii) an action brought against a seller for negligent entrustment or negligence per se;\n \n (iii) an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product knowingly violated a State or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product, and the violation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought, including--\n \n (I) any case in which the manufacturer or seller knowingly made any false entry in, or failed to make appropriate entry in, any record required to be kept under Federal or State law with respect to the qualified product, or aided, abetted, or conspired with any person in making any false or fictitious oral or written statement with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or other disposition of a qualified product; or\n \n (II) any case in which the manufacturer or seller aided, abetted, or conspired with any other person to sell or otherwise dispose of a qualified product, knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer of the qualified product was prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm or ammunition under subsection (g) or (n) of section 922 of title 18, United States Code;\n \n (iv) an action for breach of contract or warranty in connection with the purchase of the product;\n \n (v) an action for death, physical injuries or property damage resulting directly from a defect in design or manufacture of the product, when used as intended or in a reasonably foreseeable manner, except that where the discharge of the product was caused by a volitional act that constituted a criminal offense, then such act shall be considered the sole proximate cause of any resulting death, personal injuries or property damage; or\n \n (vi) an action or proceeding commenced by the Attorney General to enforce the provisions of chapter 44 of title 18 or chapter 53 of title 26, United States Code.\n \n (B) NEGLIGENT ENTRUSTMENT- As used in subparagraph (A)(ii), the term `negligent entrustment' means the supplying of a qualified product by a seller for use by another person when the seller knows, or reasonably should know, the person to whom the product is supplied is likely to, and does, use the product in a manner involving unreasonable risk of physical injury to the person or others.\n\n \n No blanket ban on lawsuits against the firearms industry exists.",

   "Go get 'em Tiger!\n \n Pajamas Media Worse Than Gunwalker? State Dept. Allegedly Sold Guns to Zetas\n \n \nPhil Jordan, a former CIA operative and one-time leader of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's El Paso Intelligence Center, claims that the Obama administration is running guns to the violent Zetas cartel through the direct commercial sale of military grade weapons:\n \n \n Jordan, who served as director of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's El Paso Intelligence Center in 1995, said the Zetas have shipped large amounts of weapons purchased in the Dallas area through El Paso.\n \n Robert \"Tosh\" Plumlee, a former CIA contract pilot, told the Times he supported Jordan's allegations, adding that the Zetas have reportedly bought property in the Columbus, N.M., border region to stash weapons and other contraband.\n \n \"From the intel, it appears that a company was set up in Mexico to purchase weapons through the U.S. Direct Commercial Sales Program, and that the company may have had a direct link to the Zetas.\"\n \n The U.S. Direct Commercial Sales program is run from the U.S. State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. It regulates and licenses private U.S. companies' overseas sales of weapons and other defense materials, defense services, and military training. This does not include the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, which authorized sales to foreign governments. \n An El Paso Times article - as of now ignored by mainstream media - went into much more shocking detail:\n \n \n \"They've found anti-aircraft weapons and hand grenades from the Vietnam War era,\" Plumlee said. Other weapons found include grenade launchers, assault rifles, handguns and military gear including night-vision goggles and body armor.\n \n \"The information about the arms trafficking was provided to our U.S. authorities long before the 'Columbus 11&#8242; investigation began,\" said Plumlee, referring to recent indictments accusing several Columbus city officials of arms trafficking in conjunction with alleged accomplices in El Paso and Chaparral, N.M.\n \n Jes\u00fas Rej\u00f3n Aguilar, the number three man in the Zeta's hierarchy, disclosed last week that the Zetas bought weapons in the United States and transported them across the Rio Grande. Mexican federal authorities captured Rej\u00f3n on July 3 in the state of Mexico, and presented him to the news media the next day. His recorded video statement was uploaded on YouTube.\n \n Jordan agreed with Plumlee's allegations that the Zetas are operating in the Columbus-Palomas border.\n \n (snip)",

It is a matter of being sued because their products are misused and they often don't take common sense precautions to prevent their products from being misused. Examples of such precautions could include:\n\n \n In your own words they are being sued because their products are misused. Meaning their products are used in a manner they weren't marketed or intended for; IE reckless and criminal fashion that are already outlawed.\n \n \n\"Plaintiffs' lawyers were frank in admitting that these lawsuits represented an attempt to advance gun control policy through litigation, rather than legislation. 2 Plaintiffs seek to have gun makers institute controls on the design and the distribution of their products that go well beyond state and federal regulations.\n\n \n There is an unfortunate problem with this approach. Because this is a matter related to a local lawsuit rather than a legislative attempt through one level of government or another there is nothing to stop manufacturers from choosing to abandon the proposed litigation-sought practices and revert to their old methods of business.\n \n The city of Gary lacks any measure of authority to force manufacturers well beyond the jurisdiction of the state from engaging in business practices that would affect sales nationwide. The city cannot legally exert authority beyond city limits against a manufacturer that is already complying with federal law to engage in business to begin with.\n \n \nSpecifically, plaintiffs want the gun industry to: stop developing high caliber, concealable products;\n\n \n The plaintiffs have no such ability to make any such demands as it would affect nationwide sales and violate interstate commerce.\n \n \nrecall products with safety-related defects;\n\n \n Such a recall would be impossible in nature. A manufacturer cannot be forced to institute a recall of millions of products across the nation in order to comply with the demands of a single city and its litigious examples of overstepping its authority.\n \n \ndevelop and implement 'smartgun' technology;\n\n \n Such technology is impossible both on the practical and the physical level. It would also violate consumer's rights by preventing them from being able to sell private property in a private and legal manner, as well as eliminating the ability for a firearm to become a family heirloom and passed down from one generation to another.\n \n \nclose perceived 'loopholes' in gun shows by which assault rifles and high capacity ammunition magazines allegedly flow in the market;\n\n \n This too is impossible. Firearms manufacturers and dealers have absolutely no say in how property holders choose to dispose of their privately owned goods. Once the initial sale has been made through legal channels any subsequent transactions are beyond the scope of authority of anyone in the chain of sales and distribution. Only congress possesses authority to regulate such matters.\n \n \nprohibit sales to 'kitchen-table' gun dealers;\n\n \n Prey tell exactly what is a \"kitchen-table gun dealer\" and why should they be prohibited? If they are in possession of a federal firearms license they are already subject to federal and ATF oversight on their sales and are bound by set laws and practices regarding sales. If they are private individuals simply liquidating their existing stock in a manner inconsistent with earning a living then they are still operating within the law.\n \n \nand develop systems to spot and weed out dealers who sell disproportionate numbers of crime guns...\n\n \n Such a system is already in existence. It is known as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n \n \n\"Wesson cut a sweetheart deal with the Clinton Administration early on in the nuisance lawsuit onslaught, agreeing to modify its product design and distribution in return for being dropped from some of the lawsuits.25 Among other things, Smith & Wesson agreed: to add a second, hidden serial number on its guns to prevent criminals from obliterating them; to sell an external locking device with every gun; to implement internal locking devices on all guns and safety devices and magazine disconnects on all pistols; to create and implement child safety designs to prevent handguns from ready operation by children under the age of six; and to commit a percentage of its annual revenues to the development of 'smart gun' technology.26.\n\n \n This would appear to be an unconstitutional act when going by what you have posted previously regarding congress interfering in ongoing lawsuits.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/436139-post27.html\n \n \n\"Ultimately, the Indiana Supreme Court held that the City presented valid claims for public nuisance, negligent sales, and negligent design. This case was remanded for further proceedings. See, City of Gary v. Smith & Wesson Corp., 801 N.E.2d 1222 (Ind. 2003). During the pendency of this case, Congress enacted, and the President signed into law, the PLCAA.\" \n \n So while the case was pending new legislation was passed by Congress. The court also held that the PLCAA was unconstitutional because it affects pending cases which violates the Separation of Powers:\n \n \"Further, in United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. 128 (1872), the United States Supreme Court established Article III limitation on Congressional law making power. The holding in Klein was simply that Congress cannot, through legislation, direct the outcome of pending cases since to do so would infringe upon the judiciaries role in deciding cases and violate the Separation of Powers as guaranteed by the Constitution. The scope of the PLCAA clearly and unmistakably directs the outcome of this pending case; and, therefore, is a clear and unmistakable violation of the Separation of Powers as guaranteed by the Constitution; and is, therefore, unconstitutional.\"\n\n \n So while the lawsuit of City of Gary v Smith & Wesson was being carried out the Clinton Administration entered into a settlement deal with Smith & Wesson; implement new design changes and the lawsuits will be dropped against you. Isn't that unconstitutional according to what you said?\n \n \n\"Similarly, in August 2003, two California gun dealers and three gun distributors reached a settlement with San Francisco and eleven other California cities and counties in return for being released, shortly before trial, from lawsuits brought by those cities.27 Pursuant to that settlement, the gun dealers agreed to: stop selling firearms at gun shows, implement an enhanced inventory tracking plan to ensure that firearms are not lost or stolen; annually train all employees on how to recognize and block sales to 'straw' purchasers; and maintain electronically all BATF firearms trace requests and provide the requested information to gun manufacturers and distributors to help them monitor the conduct of dealers who sell their firearms.28 Distributors agreed to take extra steps to verify dealer licenses and restrict sales of assault weapons, and to donate $50,000 to partially compensate plaintiffs for some of the costs of the lawsuits.29 Settlements such as these tend to undermine the industry defendants' contention that reduction of gun violence is completely beyond their control, and indicates that plaintiffs are winning key battles, if not the war, on handguns.\"\n http://www.pbnlaw.com/data/articles/Are_Public_Nuisance_Lawsuits_Against_the_Handgun_I-64.pdf\n\n \n California is not at issue when the discussion is linked to litigation within the state of Indiana. Simply because several dealers within the state of California chose to cave because they couldn't afford a legal fight is no sign of progress.\n \n \nSo good progress was being made before the unconstitutional PLCAA became law.\n\n \n It has already been addressed how the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act is not unconstitutional.\n \n You claimed: http://www.4forums.com/political/436120-post24.html\n \n \nDue Process is violated when Congress abolishes an existing remedy and provides no alternative. To deprive the City of its right in interest deprives the City of a vested cause of action without just compensation; thereby the PLCAA is violative of the Due Process Clause and, therefore, unconstitutional.\"\n\n \n To which you were shown: http://www.4forums.com/political/436224-post49.html\n \n Read The Bill: S. 397 [109th] - GovTrack.us\n \n \n(5) QUALIFIED CIVIL LIABILITY ACTION-\n \n (A) IN GENERAL- The term `qualified civil liability action' means a civil action or proceeding or an administrative proceeding brought by any person against a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product, or a trade association, for damages, punitive damages, injunctive or declaratory relief, abatement, restitution, fines, or penalties, or other relief, resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product by the person or a third party, but shall not include--\n \n (i) an action brought against a transferor convicted under section 924(h) of title 18, United States Code, or a comparable or identical State felony law, by a party directly harmed by the conduct of which the transferee is so convicted;\n \n (ii) an action brought against a seller for negligent entrustment or negligence per se;\n \n (iii) an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product knowingly violated a State or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product, and the violation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought, including--\n \n (I) any case in which the manufacturer or seller knowingly made any false entry in, or failed to make appropriate entry in, any record required to be kept under Federal or State law with respect to the qualified product, or aided, abetted, or conspired with any person in making any false or fictitious oral or written statement with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or other disposition of a qualified product; or\n \n (II) any case in which the manufacturer or seller aided, abetted, or conspired with any other person to sell or otherwise dispose of a qualified product, knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer of the qualified product was prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm or ammunition under subsection (g) or (n) of section 922 of title 18, United States Code;\n \n (iv) an action for breach of contract or warranty in connection with the purchase of the product;\n \n (v) an action for death, physical injuries or property damage resulting directly from a defect in design or manufacture of the product, when used as intended or in a reasonably foreseeable manner, except that where the discharge of the product was caused by a volitional act that constituted a criminal offense, then such act shall be considered the sole proximate cause of any resulting death, personal injuries or property damage; or\n \n (vi) an action or proceeding commenced by the Attorney General to enforce the provisions of chapter 44 of title 18 or chapter 53 of title 26, United States Code.\n \n (B) NEGLIGENT ENTRUSTMENT- As used in subparagraph (A)(ii), the term `negligent entrustment' means the supplying of a qualified product by a seller for use by another person when the seller knows, or reasonably should know, the person to whom the product is supplied is likely to, and does, use the product in a manner involving unreasonable risk of physical injury to the person or others.\n\n \n Therefore the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act cannot be deemed as unconstitutional, due to the fact that alternatives to previously existing remedies were put into place so legitimate lawsuits may be filed.",

What accidents were occurring due to the lack of this feature that warranted to city suing over its lack of existence on certain models?\n \n Furthermore why was this feature unnecessary from 1901 forward when magazine fed, semi-automatic handguns were truly coming into being and found popular with the American people, up until the time of this lawsuit?",

For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power.\"\n\n Is he talking about you?

   "  FEDERALIST No. 78 -- The Judiciary Department \n The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution. By a limited Constitution, I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex-post-facto laws, and the like. Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void. Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.\n \n &#8230; No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny this, would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid.\n \n \n Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental. \n",
