   "Ten Reasons Why I Broke Up with God\n By Annabelle Gurwitch, TheNation.com\n Posted on December 13, 2007, Printed on December 13, 2007\n http://www.alternet.org/story/70460/\n \n After his address on religion last week, I'm sure I'll never be invited to Mitt Romney's White House should he be elected President. It's not just because as a National Public Radio commentator, documentary filmmaker, single-payer universal healthcare proponent and driver's license for illegal immigration-supporting liberal, I don't travel in the same circles as he does. As an atheist, I now know that I'm not even included in Romney's America.\n \n You see, I broke up with God years ago, but not really because of the big stuff that leading godless heathens like Christopher Hitchens write about. As with most relationships, it's the little things that drove me crazy. Here's my top-ten list of reasons I gave God the old heave-ho. In no particular order:\n \n 1. Shellfish. My God would never make mussels, clams and oysters taste so good and then prohibit me, a Jewish gal, from eating them.\n \n 2. The meek shall inherit the earth. In my family, like much of America's workforce, not only have the meek inherited nothing, they are barely holding on to their standard of living. So on this point alone, I reject the Bible.\n \n 3. American Gladiators. If there were a God, American Gladiators would not be returning to TV this winter.\n \n 4. Iran. If there were a God one part of our government wouldn't be opening doors to negotiate with Ahmadinejad, while another fans the flames for military action.\n \n 5. There's not enough good Szechwan in Los Angeles. If there were a God, he would make better Chinese food more readily available in Los Angeles. LA is mostly made up of transplanted New Yorkers, so why can't we get good old chicken and broccoli in garlic source out West?\n \n 6. Britney Spears. If there were a God, Britney Spears wouldn't be one of the most Googled topics on the Internet. Although perhaps there is a God and this is one of the signs of the apocalypse. Example: Spears gave us views of her vajayjay: 3,450,000 Google hits. Jonas Salk gave us the polio vaccine: 212,000 Google hits.\n \n 7. Multitasking is of dubious effectiveness. Recent studies have shown that multitasking isn't that productive. If there were a God, he wouldn't allow my illusion of being able to accomplish more on a daily basis to be taken away from me.\n \n 8. God doesn't give you anything you can't handle. My God wouldn't allow people to make up inane aphorisms about him. I'm disorganized, easily distracted, have a fear of anything medical and have a kid with health issues. My God would know that I was a poor choice for this assignment, that this saying is just moronic and only serves to make people like me feel worse when we inevitably fail.\n \n 9. Trannies. Most all of the little beauty tips I've employed in my career as an actress I learned from the transvestites and transsexuals I used go-go dance with on the bar at the Pyramid Club in NYC. Especially tricks with crazy glue. My God simply would not stand for unequal treatment of gay people.\n \n 10. Darfur, AIDS, my awe and respect for the mysteries of science, that lead paint is in kids' toys, that we allow people to live on the streets, that we haven't passed stricter gun legislation... OK, I lied. I have a million top ten reasons why I reject the notion of the kind of God invoked in particular by the Republican candidates, though most of the Democrats have also enrolled in the campaign God-a-thon.\n \n That said, I am willing to admit that I might be completely wrong about God. After all, round-toed Mary Janes are back, which is something I've prayed for, because it's just against nature to squeeze into pointy-toed high heels. Furthermore, Donny and Marie are reuniting. It seems so improbable that there is interest in them that even immaculate conception seems plausible to me now. Not to mention that the chance of a presidential run by former pastor Mike Huckabee -- not long after a movie about existentialism titled I (Heart) Huckabee was released -- seems to be the same as the notion that dinosaurs walked the earth at the same time as man.\n \n But if Mitt and I ever did break bread, he would get no flak from me on the Mormon faith. Compared to burning bushes, people turning into piles of salt, plagues and general mayhem of the Bible, I find Joseph Smith's buried tablets written in the secret language that no one has ever heard of a perfectly reasonable story that was turned into a three-part series on South Park -- such consistently brilliant satire that its existence alone might just prove there is a God.",

(Please now, I am not equating anything here, so I hope others don't jump on this.) The realization one comes to is that my previous way of thinking just isn't going to cut it anymore. I have to face this new reality. It is very painful. It is scary to face the world in a new way. The social repercussion are potentially enormous as you are worry about losing people in your life. I was very fortunate in not really losing anyone, but I was terrified of the possibility. \n \n As you admit, when it is all over, it is a huge relief and life is much better facing the truth rather than self-delusion.",

After the high wears off, they experience the same problems they did before.\n If they are still available, I can show you some youtube clips that show people still suffering moments after an 'anointed healer' laid hands on them and proclaimed them better.\n \n As to speaking in tongues, that's a learned experience and common parlor-style stick. Some who have worked in this 'industry' have come forward and spoken clearly how they get the majority of people to babble like an infant. Others have admitted 'faking' that 'gift' so as to fit in and feel more important. \n There have been NO documented cases of anyone speaking in a foreign language (which is what biblical tongues is about) related to Christianity.\n \n I've personally delt with some people who were like unker here, who have left these types of groups and later admit to how they were sucked into it.\n Fake it til you make it.\n And being conscious of the fact isn't necessary.\n Just like many people who fall for simple psychological manipulation tricks, you can even know how it works and still be a sucker. \n And like a con, some people simply don't want to admit the truth due to pride issues and not wanting to be seen as a dupe or ignorant of weakly taken advantage of.\n \n As I've discussed with you before, the bible is clear on charismatic gifts.\n You get what the spirit gives you and the spirit doesn't have to give you anything unless there is a reason.\n Gifts are not 'show things' to make you feel good. They were for education and conversion purposes.\n \n The lie is in the beginning. Believing what people falsely push upon you from a self imposed position of authority.\n And, I'd ask you to think of Simon the sorcerer from Acts.\n He was a huckster who sought to buy these gifts because his heart wasn't in the right place and he didn't understand what they were for. He wanted to use them to elevate himself and help his business. He saw and wanted.\n He was severly chastised becasue that's not what they are for and you can't buy...nor fake them.\n Fake miracles are the work of the beast. Used to deceive the church. \n These facimilies are used by the 'Super Apostles' Paul warns about. The Wolves in your midst to devour you and market you for their own purposes.\n \n You shouldn't chase after signs and experiences but keep to the unchanging word of God. \n It's for these very reasons that in over 2,000 years of this Christian movement, believers haven't followed such or put much focus on it. And in nearly every recorded instances of some prophet (after the 1st Apostles have long died) comeing forth and pushing that they have these gifts, a close review of their beliefs in comparison to what the Word has to teach has proven them to be heretics.\n \n A 'Christian experience' is the regenerating and strengthening of a believer in times of temptation and turmoil. To withstand attacks and remain firm in their faith. To suffer loss and grieve yet to be made ever more in the image of the Christ.\n It's NOT to babble like a pagan, or wallow upon the floor like a drunkard. To run, shout and carry on like a hysterical woman. \n It's to know that the good works, which are the fruit of your faith, will speak to all who witness of your conviction and that no matter what persecution you face you are the one to seek reconciliation with your tormentors and be ever ready to forgive when asked and if that doesn't happen, to know that the kingdom of Heaven awaits. A place where you'll be justified for your faith and actions and know eternal joy in the light of God.\n \n If you're in a Flesh-oriented church that tries to pass an emotional experience off as a spiritual one. You need to flee.\n \n You can sing and dance for the Lord and to express your thanks but, that's only a partial product of worship. Not the end result and not the experience.\n And if one is being led by the Spirit in such things as these, a pastor would NEVER have the power to 'turn them on or off' as some have demonstrated.\n \n This is not to say that you engage in such behavior, nor if you do that you do so all the time. But to state that many religions that do these things are ingenious and harmful counterfeits.\n The title 'Cult' serves them well.",

   "Tell me this paulie, if you spoke in tongues and layed hands on people in prayer that resulted in healings then you were filled with the Holy Spirit of God. Because one can only receive and exhibit the gifts of the Spirit if they have the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of God, so how did you go from that pinnacle of christian experience to believing that God doesn't even exist? Were you in fact a charlatan who was faking being a christian? Because there is no way you really spoke in tongues and laid hands on people according to Gods spirit and then after allegedly having these gifts you just decided God doesn't exist. So lie to yourself about having known God but don't lie to me because I know what a real relationship with Him is all about and I too have spoken in tongues and laid hands on others leading to healings, and there is no way I could walk away from God after experiencing His gifts first hand.\n\n i didnt \"just\" believe that god doesnt exist. it was a long process that took several months. i was a closet agnostic for a few months. i continued to go to church while seriously pondering every word my pastor spoke. and to be honest, the pastor of my church is an intelligent guy. he is well read and travelled, speaks several languages and has a good grasp of economics, business, politics and other \"thinking\" subjects. plus he breaks down the scriptures in a way that i still admire.\n \n when i spoke to him about my position, he was very civil and treated me with respect, even though he disagreed he never made it an issue of right or wrong, but rather asked me questions to see if he could help me reevaulate my position. i did think about what he said and left the meeting with even more respect than ever.\n \n as for laying of hands, healing the sick, speaking in tongues, and other \"manifestations\" of the holy spirit, i can still do those things. none of these need god's existence to work. you dont utter meaningless sounds involuntarily under the control of any external supernatural force. you utter these sounds in faith as a form of advanced praise to god, but you control what you do and voluntarily say what comes out of your mouth. healing the sick is not a matter of a supernatural force entering a sick person's body and surgically mending their internal ailment. prayer and healing works because the person being prayed for accepts mentally that they are going to get better, and for the majority of pains and aches, thats all that is necessary. agreeing in faith on the acheivement of any goal works in secular groups just as well as in church groups. \n \n that religious practices and techniques work because long long ago, somebody discovered the amazing power of the subconscious mind, the power of positive thinking, and the power of agreement, but couldnt figure out how the heck it could be possible. it seemed as though these events of good fortune were caused by a powerful unseen force, and that was because they was. to them they were miracles, and for all intents and purposes they were. this was religion in the purest form: the power of faith\n \n of course, religion expanded and evolved. this unseen force took on a personality, with a temperament, and likes and dislikes. originally, the only way tp tap into this unseen power was by the way you thought. men wanting power expanded on this idea, created justification for people's misfortunes, and segregated the \"blessed\" from the \"cursed\". to this day, society has never recovered from this tragic paradigm, and only in small circles, almost an underground movement, is the original system of faith being revived\n \n now you can wave away everything i just said as an elaborate cop-out of believing in god. and i'm not trying to convince you that youre wrong and i'm right. i'm just telling you what went through my mind and what i've learned in becoming an atheist\n \n i think i am in a unique position. i have never and cannot look down on believers, or feel that i am more enlightened than the person in religion. i dont condemn people who believe in creation or protest against homosexuality. i still view religion itself as a cornerstone of civilization, and i think it was a necessary and inevitable part of our social evolution. i never generalize that all christians are gullible sheep, nor that all atheists are superior geniuses. this seperates me from most other atheists. abandoning my belief in god doesnt release me from being morally responsible or knowing what right and wrong is. it doesnt mean that i cant exercise faith, love my neighbor, or follow any of the other principles i learned as a christian\n \n where i distance myself from christianity the most is the issue of afterlife. i am totally annoyed by the idea pedalling the concept of going to heaven or hell. as a matter of fact, if you need the ultimate carrot and stick of eternal life or eternal anguish, if you need to be constantly reminded that god is watching you, if you can only be motivated to do good because you want a reward, then how in the world can you tell anyone that you are morally superior? this is the main aspect of christianity that creeps me out, and ultimately, it is the biggest form of corruption that religion is polluted with",

   "I can relate to you and sinjin. Although I spent years in churches pretending, it wasn't until recently I actually accepted the fact there really isn't any evidence for any of it. It is all a big hoax.\n\n \n Oh, I've pretended and was respectful too.\n \n I attended some services only out of love for my family who believed and to show them support and solidarity. \n Most of my political and moral beliefs coinside with Christianity and could see commonality in goals.\n \n Several years back, I participated in one of those odd events that Churches put on for fun and education. It was 'Antioch 67' dealing with the early church days when many believers hid and were persecuted. As a sculpter, I doned the robes as a potter for a week and knew some of the actual history of those times and places as well as the job. As the kids came around, I'd educate them on some trivia.\n Most said that of all those present, I fit the part the best. Having the long 'Jesus' hair and appearance. I've even had some tell me that I looked like Jesus in the past...when I was in my prime. ;)\n All that...and an athiest.\n \n When out eating at restaurants with the children alone, I'd have them pray before eating IN PUBLIC, simply out of respect to the wife who was a believer.\n That's not to say I went about things blindly or failed to not express my views. Like if Christmas is the birthday celebration of the Christ, then He's the one to be thought of and honored...and not let the kids turn it into a hypocritical event. If they were going to be anything, hypocrits wasn't one of them. \n \n When the children were in an evangelistic oriented private school (I believe in public education but sometimes it lacks and I think there are too many pit falls of home schooling to do it myself) I was supportive there too. Didn't get upset that they taught creationism and ID. Brushing them up on concepts of evolution for later use isn't too hard to do on my own.\n I recall even drawing a poster for my son (Moses's*- My choice of names, not the wifes) class.\n He's into snakes...BIG time and the project was looking for a class mascot.\n Being a sometimes-professional artist, I drew a picture of bible-Moses' outstretched hand grasping his Staff that was turning into a cobra that had the tail of another snake hanging out of it's mouth with the motto \"None before Me.\" on it. This tied in with his love of snakes, a bible-based story playing on my sons name, the fact that a cobra was sacred to the Egyptians (mocking the heathens) and is a snake eating creature and the fact that that was what happend in the biblical story of the staff. Plus it supported the notion of a jealous God who's power was greater than any other and reinforces one of the commandments.\n Pretty clever huh?\n * One time, one of the nutter parents commented that when she was pregnant with her youngest, her oldest suggested the name Moses, she replied that she didn't know of any white people with that name. It stung a bit of racism.\n \n Jo Bennet (from another forum) here could attest that while agnostic, I was fairly supportive of and not excessively hostile to believers.\n \n But, that changes when believers end up only thinking they are right. Rather than seek secular support to common-cause agendas, they take a hard core 'If you're not with us, you're against us.' stance. It changes if you're scapegoated.\n \n \n In the end, after a convoluted series of events.\n My position won out.\n \n Most family members and friends, on their own, eventually came to the same conclusion I did. Almost using the same reasoning and resources I did. Without a single shred of help or influence from me.\n Some still believe and so long as not being hypocrits or attacking me, I don't have a real problem with it.\n \n I believe religion is in-built to most of humanity. Part of our curiosity and desire to know. But, like with most people, some are immune to it or composed without what ever it is that forms into that aspect. \n That explains why some people convert from one faith to another. There's that ingrained desire for it.\n Couple it with how it's reinforced and propagated from generation to generation and it's little wonder that we still have it.\n I'd even say that if civilization were to abandon it, it'd still rise up in times of crisis and stress like other vestigal psychological aspects we have. \n \n Anyway, just tonight as the son and I were out watching I Am Legend and The Chipmunk movie, we noticed some former family friends who were hard core evangelical nutters. They did as they believe...they shunned. They were instrumental in my scapegoating years back too. Odd, since I went out of the way to abundantly buy them gifts for a baby shower for their oldest daughter...they were the wifes friends, and while I didn't like them, I believe friends do good for friends and wished for my wife to be a blessing to her friends.\n And being human, knowing many of their deep dark hypocritical secrets. I felt the victor.\n Like Legion did at the end in Stephen King's 'Storm of the Century'.\n I then thought, What would I do if I was one of the last humans alive lik the movies Legend or Mist and stumbled across them, would I help?\n \n Kinda makes it hard when you know their answer...\n \n \n But, now, from time to time, I'll visit some chruch out of curiosity as to their beliefs and practices. You can read a lot on a subject, but real anthropological study is often hands on. \n When I go, I'm respectful and more often than not, simply state 'Peace be with you.'",

   "Begging your pardon, but I have to day that when it comes to believers, their god is a reflection of them, not of anything else. there are many kind and wonderful believers, who just so happen to believe in a kind and wonderful God. Other people are loveless, obsessed with sex, and the sexual behavior of others, and their god just so happens to be loveless, ridged and so concerend with the sexual behavior of others.\n\n I think that's a fair assessment, and put in a way I hadn't considered before. As Christians are all supposed to be singing from the same hymn sheet, and as that hymn sheet is so widely and differently interpreted, that should be evidence enough that it could not be divinely inspired. emoticon_xhoho",

   "And what actions would those be? You talk as if we were raised together and you have my whole life history to fall back on in not only judging my relationship with God but in condemning it as false and assumed. Tell me, where were you at Jesus 75 when God stopped the rain instantly in response to 30,000 believers praying for it together? I missed you there as I accepted Jesus as my Savior that weekend. Tell me, where did you sit in Bible College in all of my classes? I don't remember you there. And what gift did you give us as a wedding present? I don't remember it. And where are you in the pictures of when we celebrated the births of our daughters? I can't find you in them. \n \n So on what basis do you judge my personal relationship with God through Christ? And are you actually implying that because you never actually had a real and true relationship with God that neither could I? face it, that is the depth of your assertions. It didn't happen to me so neither could it have happened to anyone else. So it all must be fake and unreal. That is the basis upon which all unbelievers base their rejection of Christ and their condemnation of those who claim to know Him personally. \n \n Well paulie, you'll need to do better than that if you intend to insist that I and my God is a fraud. At least target a born again believer you have known for a lifetime before you insist on condemning them but don't choose someone like me whom you have never even met as it makes you appear irrational and even delusional. Which from where I'm sitting, any person who would say so adamantly what you say above about someone you have never even met is the most rational diagnosis available. \n \n So let me ask you paulie, have you seen a shrink lately, cuz I think you're having delusions of grandeur or some other mental break with reality as you attempt to define people you have never even met.\n\n they invented this thing called a mirror. ever heard of it?\n \n you are the one, who having never met me, nor knowing anything about my real life experiences, accused me of being a fraud and never being a true believer. so by the same token, who are you to tell me anything about the authenticity of my experiences?\n \n and yes, your relationship with god is fake. god doesnt exist, so any relationship with god is purely imaginary. if your evidence of god's existence is seeing rain stop falling upon christians praying for it to stop, then you have the same prayer/answer ratio as any other religion, which also on occassion have their prayers \"answered\" immediately while they pray. its interesting how easy it is for you to rationalize the 999 other instances when you prayed and got no answer as \"well, god will answer in his time\", yet the one time out of a thousand when the answer and prayer coincide, its evidence that god answers prayer. if the rain had stopped falling at any time it would be counted as evidence that god answers prayer. wow",

And I don't say this to downplay any 'pain' anyone has dealt with in changing their beliefs or getting rid of them.\n\n \n \n You do have a skill for missing the point.\n \n Regarding the first section, one does not \"accept atheism\", you simply reject the idea in the belief in god when it does not make sense. There is no other \"ism\" that must rush in to fill the void. With respect to the moral aspect of belief, it makes no sense to reject a belief in god because you don't like the idea of this god dictating moral authority. You have the cart before the horse. If I believed in a supreme being, whether I liked the idea of his making the rules or not is immaterial. Them's the rules. And if there is a supreme being, he makes the rules and my opinion doesn't count. I simply reject the idea of this being FIRST. The issue of deciding upon one's moral footing then necessarily is a separate issue. Those ridiculous philosophical arguments for the existence of god and all come from the point of view of the religious apologist.

   "I said, I'm not trying down-play anything here. \n\n \n Then what was the point, to start a pity the Christians and especially poor jyoshu thread? \n \n \nBut sorry, mean-spiritedness is mean-spiritedness--there's no more justification for intentional arrogance, name-calling, and condescending words here than there is in the realm of disagreement in one's \"personal\" life. Being an atheist no more gives you license to do so toward believers than their stance gives them to be so toward atheists.\n\n \n Again, what's the point of this? How does this relate to the original topic of the thread? \n \n \nAnd you keep beating your same dead horse about me having no \"experience\" or \"understanding\" when it comes to atheism. Well, no, I'm not an atheist--I haven't claimed to be one. Nor do I claim to have your experience and knowledge about all this. All I know is that I most certainly have gone through questioning and considered probably every argument against the validity of Christian belief and overall belief in God one could think of. I probably don't have your degree of experience, but that doesn't mean my views are inferior to yours.\n\n \n LOL. Dead horse eh? Is that what you call it when you have no reasonable response to a point?\n \n If you have no direct experience or knowledge of a subject, how can reasonably claim that your views are not inferior? I wouldn't claim than my views on astrophysics are superior to an astrophyscists because I've taken a physics class, looked at the stars, and talked about it on the internet. I also wouldn't claim that my views and understanding of you particular branch of Christianity are as valid as yours either, that's unreasonable. How could they be?\n \n The simple fact is, you've demonstrated both in this post and others, that you have a very poor grasp on atheism or what it means to be an atheist.\n \n At any rate, you've manged to completely hijack a post with your insatiable need to say \"me too\". Your constant pointing the finger and saying \"yeah, but you guys do bad stuff too\" is just childish, and that dead horse, is beat up.\n \n Two wrongs don't make a right. \n \n Waxy",

   "Regarding the first section, one does not \"accept atheism\", you simply reject the idea in the belief in god when it does not make sense. \n\n \n That's fine, if you prefer to call it that. IMO, there's no substantive difference between those two concepts. Absence-of-belief is no different substantively than belief-of-absence, in this context. I realise you prefer to call it \"lack of belief in God\" rather than \"belief there is no God\". But if I ask you \"do you believe there is no God\", chances are you're going to say yes. So I just don't see that it matters much either way. The difference is a case of semantic quibbling, IMO. Dictionaries define it both ways, so it's just a matter-of-opinion thing. I don't see what the fuss is over that, whether yours is a 'belief' or lack thereof. Either way, it's not like you're subscribing to something supernatural, even if you DO say it as \"belief there is no god.\"\n \n \nWith respect to the moral aspect of belief, it makes no sense to reject a belief in god because you don't like the idea of this god dictating moral authority.\n \n And if there is a supreme being, he makes the rules and my opinion doesn't count. I simply reject the idea of this being FIRST.\n\n \n Why not [make no sense]? Isn't the idea that belief in the supernatural may dictate morality one of the things you don't like about belief in the supernatural? There's no way to separate belief in God from the idea that God affects morality. If he didn't, he wouldn't be God, after all. It comes with the territory, by default.\n \n \nThose ridiculous philosophical arguments for the existence of god and all come from the point of view of the religious apologist. No atheist need a philosophical argument like that to reject what clearly seems like superstition.\n\n \n Well, you may think they are \"ridiculous\" but a lot of people find them compelling. They are general-sense type arguments. For example, the \"cosmological argument\" is just another way of saying the existence of matter and energy may require a cause. I certainly see nothing any more compelling than the idea of a first-cause creator to settle that. Frankly I find it fascinating that you'd think the idea of the existence of matter and energy in the universe--in fact the universe itself--needing a first-cause to be \"ridiculous\". You may hold to OTHER ideas, but I don't think you're being fair to say that's \"ridiculous\".\n \n \nMy criticism of the story of the atheist-turned-believer is that it sounded fake. It smacked of all the unfounded criticisms of atheism that you routinely hear from believers. It simply didn't ring true.\n\n \n That's interesting, because to me it smacked of all the arguments I hear from atheists against religion.\n \n \nNow the second section. You are again off base. You aren't in the stadium. No one is saying \"atheists are getting any shorter end of the stick here [more] than anyone else\". I was merely commenting on Unkerpaulie's posts about how hard disillusionment can be (though greatly preferable to \"illusionment\" in the long run).

Talk about claims of victimhood. If one criticizes religion on a religion debate forum, that NO ONE is holding a gun to your head to join, you claim foul. Grow up.\n\n \n I don't think that's a very fair assessment, but I'm not going to argue with you on it because it's no more than different ways of seeing the situation. (Despite you even validating what I said by statements like \"grow up\" and the false assertion \"about you\", when I certainly DON'T think it's about me.) It was not my intention to belittle or downplay anything you or anyone else has experienced. But portraying the changing of one's views toward atheism (or as you view it: abandoning belief) as coming from a bad thing into a good thing, and being a painful process because of the way others view you over it gives a rather one-sided impression, IMO. Religion and spiritualism can be a wonderful thing, and with all the negativity religion gets here, I just think it's important to point that out. (Ok, I guess I did argue with you some on it. emoticon_xangel )",

   "Just to chime in quickly here...\n \n There are some people who do acknowledge a god but do chose not to worship it nor follow it's rules because they like to do their own thing. \n Often they'll make proclamations that, once they grow tired of such a life style, they'll recant, repent and become devout worshipers of their chosen god/ faith.\n \n Not exactly what jyoshu is stating but pretty close.\n \n I wouldn't call them atheist or agnostics except in the truest technical definition of the word. \n A laymans term could be back-slidders. Or unrepentant.\n \n I've met a couple. There could be more when you consider the nature of belief and how it's often a taboo subject. More so when such 'believing' people could be hit hard by evangelizing people who'd want them to repent as believers...but would give up easily and walk away on those who don't believe.",

   "fine, but I think it's also important to note that was only one single thing the author said. You've zero-ed in on that one assertion, but he said a number of other things too such as how he got past the whole deal of there being evil and suffering in the world (another thing I hear atheists bring up a lot).\n\n Can I remind you how this exchange started? Thelmoose said\n \nThis sounds bogus anyway. The guy does not sound like an atheist. He sounds like the athiest that bible thumpers envision:\n\n He then quoted\n \nIn retrospect I realize that my rejection of Christianity stemmed from what Josh McDowell considers the three most common excuses for rejecting Christ: pride, moral problems and ignorance. I did not want to yield to anything, preferring myself as the ultimate authority in my life.\n\n It was the emboldened part that I (and I believe thelmoose) challenged: neither of us, I believe, nor anyone we have known, holds this up as a motivation for adopting atheism. It is a bogus assertion. Yes, thelmoose and I may well have 'zero-ed in' on it, but if it's bogus, why should we not do so? If an arguer plants a blatant falsehood among a clutch of more contestable claims, are we supposed to hold back from pointing it out on the grounds that it's 'only one single thing the author said'? How many falsehoods should we allow him before we speak up?",
