   "A nation defending policies that are wrong will remain divided until they are rectified. The United States and Israel find themselves at odds with most of the rest of the world?s nations on some key issues with the Palestinian people crisis being the main headline. The American people are blinded by the American mass media news coverage from OJ to Jackson to the facts and realities to what is really going on in other parts of the world as well as in our own nation. \n \n Since the Oslo Accord of 1993 the population of the Jewish settlers in the West Bank has more than double. Many thousands of Palestinian homes have been destroyed creating tens of thousands of new Palestinian refugees. With one thing being said at the peace talks and in the media and another thing happening on the streets going un-reported to the American people. It is the hypocrisy of the United States enforcing the United Nations Resolutions and sanctions on one side to the letter of the law to the United States own interpretation while letting their allied (State of Israel) get away with the gentrification of the Palestinian society. \n \n There is no question whether Saddam was a bad leader of Iraq or if he should have been remove from power. The real question is how much of a real threat Saddam was to the rest of the world, more specifically the United States and how he should be remove. The manner in which President Bush took the leading role going outside the global community of nation saying we will do it with you or without you. Forming a military coalition of three nations United States, Britain, and Australia to invade a nation to capture one leader and a deck of cards without out the endorsement or support of any international originations. Only for the first two years the cost to the American taxpayer is over 500 dollars for every individual in the United States. Not counting the hundreds of Americans soldiers killed and the thousands injured or maimed for life. \n \n While much of the world?s attention was focus on Iraq, Prime Minister Sharon took full advantage in his campaign against the Palestinian people. With little to no media coverage in America of the horrific acts of inhumanity taken against the Palestinian society by the Israeli Defense Forces unless there was a suicide bombing. Most of the American people have only gotten one side of the story to these two conflicts (wars) while the rest of the world has another perceptive that our government does not agree with. How and what other people and nations think about the actions the United States takes in a dictatorial unilateral way will be perceived differently.\n \n Many people in the world believe that the United States would not of take the military actions against Saddam if Iraq had little or no oil. They also believe that the State of Israel would not be a military threat to the regional peace if it where not for the un-conditional support of the United States government. The United States and Israel are two of the world?s largest exporters of military weapons with the military industrial complex being a corner stone to their economies. That Saddam, Sharon, or Bin Ladon would not be the threat to peace if it were not for the previous United States foreign and military policies.",

   "The United States and Israel find themselves at odds with most of the rest of the world's nations\n\n Just another example that doing the right thing doesn't necessarily make you popular.\n \n Besides, why should anyone be surprised that many nations objected to the U.S. using force to effect a regime change in Iraq? Most nations opposing the U.S. are run by repressive governments. It makes those governments nervous to see Saddam's brutal rule come to an end though military force. Look at the roster names of UN member states. Regime change is what many of these states desperately need, yet it's the last thing their leaders will ever allow. It's entirely expected that repressive leaders would speak out against forcible regime change, even in countries like Iraq.\n \n But why should the whims of foreign dictators (or even the vested economic interests of countries like France) determine U.S. policy in the Middle East? \n \n \nThe American people are blinded by the American mass media news coverage\n\n So you think if we Americans didn't have a log lodged in our eye, then we would see the bad guys are really the U.S. and Israel, Great Satan and Little Satan? That mantra is being heard in some circles of Europe. Indeed, the EU leadership was embarrassed enough recently to downplay the results of a European opinion poll that indicated Israel and the U.S. were the top two countries threatening world peace.\n \n Though you may share the \"popular\" opinion that America is the worst of the worst among nations, most people with even a shallow grasp of history would dismiss such prejudice as extreme rhetoric. Where's the substance?\n \n \nSince the Oslo Accord of 1993 the population of the Jewish settlers in the West Bank has more than doubled.\n\n So what? You seem unaware that the Oslo Accord of 1993 did not prohib or restrict the establishment or expansion of Jewish communities in their ancestral homeland of Judea and Samaria. In 1996 the PLO representatives to the Oslo 2 accords wanted to include a clause prohibiting new settlements. Israel rejected that demand, and Arafat signed the agreement despite his failure to achieve a halt in settlement activity during the interim period. Article XXXI of Oslo 2 states that the issue of Jewish settlements is to be addressed in the final status negotiations.\n \n \nThe real question is how much of a real threat Saddam was to the rest of the world, more specifically the United States and how he should be remove. The manner in which President Bush took the leading role going outside the global community of nation\n\n Perhaps the UN did the best it could, but when the UN proved incapable of enforcing its own Security Council resolutions, the U.S. used it prerogative to bypass further UN discussion.\n \n The U.S. acted similarly in Kosovo. When the UN Security Council refused to authorize explicit action against Milosevic, the U.S. went ahead and bombed Serbia despite the Russia claim that we were acting illegally. \n \n \nWhile much of the world's attention was focus on Iraq, Prime Minister Sharon took full advantage in his campaign against the Palestinian people.\n\n You are mistaken. On the contrary, in the period leading up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Sharon's campaign against the Palestinian terrorist infrastructure was comparatively mild so as not to distract the Bush administration's desire to focus on Iraq. A flare up of tensions in Palestine is the last thing the American's needed while they prepared to deal with Saddam. Sharon knew it and acted accordingly. \n \n \n\n Many people in the world believe that the United States would not of take the military actions against Saddam if Iraq had little or no oil.\n\n That might be true, though the U.S. still took action against Serbia, even though Milsosovic had no oil or other prized resources. But more significant, if Iraq did not have oil, then Saddam would not have had the oil revenue which made him such a menace to his neighbors and his own people.\n \n \nThey also believe that the State of Israel would not be a military threat to the regional peace if it where not for the un-conditional support of the United States government.\n\n As our most reliable democractic ally in the Middle East, Israel receives strong U.S. support, but why pretend it's unconditional. The U.S. looks to serve its own interests which often coincides but sometimes conflict with Israeli interests. We also provide support to the liberal democracies of Western Europe, but who will argue that our ties to NATO are unconditional? Our support for Israel is not based simply on strategic concerns but also shared values of our societies.",

   "In a recent european poll, many europeans see israel (and rightly so) as a bigger threat than saddam ever was,\n\n If Europeans are \"rightly so\" in seeing Israel as the biggest threat to peace, then to be consistent in your view they must likewise be \"rightly so\" in naming the U.S. as another big threat. Such opinions help to explain the continuing decline in European leverage in resolving Middle East conflicts.\n \n \n...but the israeli government called the poll anti semitic and has put pressure on european governments to bury that survey.\n\n I think you're confusing the Israeli govn't with statements made by others. Where do you find that Israel pressured the EU to \"bury that survey\"?\n \n Though the survey results were leaked just 2 months ago, the survey was in fact conducted in 2002 -- before the war with Iraq began but when Bush's rhetoric about the Iraqi threat was in full swing. Did you pause to consider the opinion poll's methodology?\n \n Israeli officials noted that the wording of the poll was such that Israel was destined to be high on the list, but that's not the same as your charge that Israel \"pressured\" the EU to bury it. Even those who conducted the survey conceded that the choice of words used in the poll was flawed and misleading.\n \n Rather, it was EU officials who were anxious to bury the survey after the initial reports were leaked. After all, the EU views itself (and would like to convince others) that it is a legitimate peace-making body. The xenophobic views revealed in the poll does not help the EU build its case for diplomatic legitimacy.\n \n When Europe cultivates the view that Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East, is more dangerous than the military dictatorships in Iran and North Korea, then how can the EU be considered a legitimate diplomatic organization that can positively contribute to the peace process. Is it any wonder that the EU wants to bury that survey?\n \n \nIt seems that the same may be happening in the american media, if you critisize israel, its seen as anti semitic, and america does have a very powerfull jewish lobby, so the press can be put under pressure not to report the whole story, you may even call it censoreship.\n\n You are a testament to the view that there are conspiracy theorists who continue to promote the idea that Jews are imposing censorship on American journalists. Perhaps you also heard the one about Jews sacrificing Christian children to use their blood to make matzoh.\n \n Criticism of Israel doesn't \"necessarily\" make you an antisemite, but if you're going to write like that, you should get used to being mistaken for one.\n \n First, contrary to your statement, criticism of Israel's policies is not 'necessarily' antisemitic. Did you really find someone who argues that criticism of Israel is antisemitic? As a matter of fact, the State of Israel can be legitimately criticized just like any other country.\n \n Second, it is undeniable that there are those whose criticism of Israel is used to masque antisemitism.\n \n So how does one tell when legitimate criticism crosses the line into antisemitism? One way is to recognize when those that criticize Israel invoke traditional anti-Jewish references, accusations and conspiracy theories. Another common theme is when Israelis are compared to Hitler and the Nazis, a charge that is blatantly hostile toward Jews in an effort to associate the victims of the Nazi crimes with the Nazi perpetrators. Finally, a bias against Jews may be evident when Israel is held to a different standard than other countries, for example when Israel is singled out for criticism for actions or policies that other nations around the world perform with impunity.\n \n In this connection it's worth noting that the report and conclusions on European antisemitism commissioned by the EU in response to the rising tide of incidents in Europe was buried last year by senior officials because it was felt the conclusions were too controversial and inflammatory to publish. The EU's political decision to shelve the report needs to seen in light of the fact that while the EU had published three reports on anti-Islamic attitudes in Europe since 2000, it had not put out a single parallel study on anti-Jewish behavior.\n \n Ironically, the EU's decision to bury its head in the sand on the antisemitism report comes in the wake of the survey that found the majority of EU citizens regard Israel as the greatest threat to world peace.",

   "i think the arabs would have fought whatever religion they were, i would guess its because they turned over a country pallestine into somebody elses hands.\n\n \n Those \"someone else's hands\" happen to belong to the other inhabitants of Palestine -- the Palestinian Jews who comprised one-third of the population and constituted a solid majority in the land allotted to them by the UN.\n \n The British had had enough and wanted to terminate their authority as the Mandatory Power, so they tossed the Palestine problem to the UN who voted to partition the land into two states, one Jewish and one Arab.\n \n You're right about one thing. The Palestinian Arabs were the belligerents who started the fighting. They denounced the UN and made a claim on the entire land. The Palestinian Jews weren't really satisfied either, especially with the Corpus Separatum provision that detached them from their holiest sites in Jerusalem, yet still they agreed to the Partition Plan for the sake of peace and regional prosperity.\n \n When the British Mandate terminated in May 1948, the Palestinian Jews proclaimed a state in accord with the UN plan. The Palestinian Arabs refused to proclaim their own state alongside the Jewish state. The Arabs gambled everything and lost. Their continuing belligerency and refusal to settle the conflict in such a way as to permit the Jewish state to survive is the primary reason for their suffering.",

   "before the state of israel was created, were there any arab terrorist killing jews? were there any arabs killing or hating jews? I dont think so.\n\n With such impaired thinking, no one will argue that history is your strong suit.\n \n You may recall that toward the end of WW1, General Allenby freed Palestine from 400 years of Ottoman rule. In the wake of the Turkish defeat, there were two competing nationalisms vying for power in Palestine. The first large-scale attacks by Arabs on Jews was in 1920 and again in 1921. That led to the founding of the Haganah as a loose-knit Jewish defense organization. Between 1921 and 1929, the Haganah stagnated as relative quiet reigned in Palestine. Then in 1929 the fierceness of Arab riots caught everyone by surprise. The Haganah's inability to prevent the slaughter of Jews in Hebron and Safed prompted the development of offensive capabilities.\n \n You can read a brief account of the 1929 Hebron massacre in the online encyclopedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron#1929_Massacre\n \n Here's a more detailed account: http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_mandate_riots_1929.php\n \n Note also the hyperlink text to the Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, who instigated the riots. The Mufti's repeated acts of belligerence eventually forced him into exile in the late 1930s. He spent most of the war years in Berlin as Hitler's guest, was in regular contact with Eichmann, and recruited several divisions of Bosnian Muslims into the SS.\n \n The next time you feel compelled to \"think\" that Arabs didn't kill or hate Jews prior to Israel's founding, pause and think again. \n \n \n \nhow would you like it if your country, your home was taken over and handed to another group of people\n\n I wouldn't like it. However, during the Ottoman and British Mandate periods, no one took over Arab homes and handed them to others. Jews purchased the land where their communities were established. If you wish to imply that Jews forcibly displaced Arabs during the century before Israel was founded, then show some evidence, if you can.\n \n Nor did the UN Partition Plan force Arabs to leave their homes to make way for Jews. No one was forced to move. The roughly 700,000 Arab refugees from the War of Independence were the product of Arab belligerence and failure. They became refugees as they fled their homes ahead of the fighting to avoid getting caught in the crossfire, and the Arab defeat prevented these people from returning to their homes.\n \n Jordan and Egypt occupied the Palestinian Arab land and kept the refugees confined to miserable camps. The Arab leadership engineered the deliberate suffering of the refugees because it better served the Arab purpose of no peace with Israel.\n \n The world community refused to recognize Jordan's annexation of the West Bank. To this day the UN does not recognize any sovereign power in the West Bank and Gaza. Officially, the legal status of the WBGS is disputed territory.\n \n Wikipedia strives for a neutral point of view. You may want to review the various articles at their website. Here's a starting point: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupied_Palestinian_territories",

Certain people in E.U were branded anti semitic by certain israeli politicians after the poll results were released. I know of many instances where colleages were asked to tone down or change certain articles they wrote, as they may be considered anti semitic, and im not talking about any right wing press, just ordinary daily newspapers. And did you know israel has press officers in there foreign embassys who sole job is to moniter and then act if any potentialy damaging reports or articles are published.\n \n Take that harmeless art exibition in sweden, the israeli government called sweden anti semitic for allowing it to be displayed. \n \n The problem isnt jewish, its israel, most people see that state as being a problem, and it doesnt help itself by its actions.\n \n My point comes through by you suggesting im anti semitic by criticizing israels political aproach, i also pointed out in earlier debates with broker, that i would fight to if i had no choice, so would he and so would you if you wee put in the pallestinians position.\n \n Every body would fight.\n \n i dont know the ins and outs of every situation and neither do you, but theres always two sides to every story and if you dont like the other side, then maybe you have a biased opinion, or have something to hide.",

   "Israelis also has a right to defend there lands, but be honest here who has more right, israel or pallestine?\n\n Israel, in my view, has at least as much right as Palestinian Arabs to exist as an independent sovereign state.\n \n Taking text from the Declaration of Israel's Independence, the land of Israel was the birthplace of the Jewish people. Here their spiritual, religious and national identity was formed. Here they achieved independence and created a culture of national and universal significance.\n \n Exiled from Palestine, the Jewish people remained faithful to it in all the countries of their dispersion, never ceasing to pray and hope for their return and the restoration of their national freedom. \n \n Impelled by this historic association, Jews strove throughout the centuries to go back to the land of their fathers and regain their statehood. In recent decades they returned in masses. They reclaimed the wilderness, revived their language, built cities and villages and established a vigorous and ever-growing community with its own economic and cultural life. They sought peace yet were ever prepared to defend themselves. They brought the blessing of progress to all inhabitants of the country. \n \n The right of the Jewish people to national revival in their own country was acknowledged by the Balfour Declaration in 1917, and re-affirmed by the League of Nations, which gave explicit international recognition to the historic connection of the Jewish people with Palestine and their right to reconstitute their National Home. \n \n In the Second World War the Jewish people in Palestine made a full contribution in the struggle of the freedom-loving nations against the Nazis. The sacrifices of their soldiers and the efforts of their workers gained them title to rank with the peoples who founded the United Nations. \n \n In 1947 the UN adopted a Resolution for the establishment of an independent Jewish State in Palestine, and called upon the inhabitants of the country to take such steps as may be necessary on their part to put the plan into effect. This recognition by the UN of the right of the Jewish people to establish their independent State may not be revoked. It is, moreover, the self-evident right of the Jewish people to be a nation, as all other nations, in its own sovereign State. \n \n What have Arabs done to deserve a separate independent Palestinian state? The Arabs of Palestine have the same culture, speak the same language, and practice the same religion as Arabs in neighboring states. They had no separate identity within the Arab world until Israel was founded. In the early 20th century the Palestinian Arabs referred to themselves as southern Syrians and made little or no effort to differentiate themselves.\n \n Ironically, it was the Jewish inhabitants who were known as Palestinians. The Palestinian Talmud is a text of ancient Jewish law. There was the Palestinian Brigade of Jewish volunteers in the British WW2 Army. The Palestinian Symphony Orchestra was all Jews. The Palestine Post was a Jewish newspaper that later became the Jerusalem Post.\n \n The idea of Palestinian Arab nationhood is a modern creation. For nearly 20 years between 1948 and 1967 the State of Israel posed no barrier to the establishment of an independent Arab state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. How come the \"Palestinians\" didn't fight the Egyptians and Jordanians who confined them in squalid refugee camps?\n \n Have you even read the 33 Articles of the PLO National Charter? What sort of morality accrues to a people whose primary reason for distinguishing themselves is the need to utterly destroy another nation?\n \n In my view, a people like the Kurds are more deserving of an independent state than are the Palestinians. The Kurds are an ancient people with a population of more than 20 million, a non-Arab culture with a unique language and customs.\n \n There is no Kurdish state. However, there are already 21 Arab states. What compelling reason is there to have 22 ? Furthermore, since Jordan was carved out of the original British Mandate for Palestine, and since Jordan's population is 60% Palestinian Arab, it's accurate to say Jordan is a Palestinian state, both ethnically and geographically.",

   "I would like to ask a question, how many israeli jews over the age of 60 were born in israel?\n\n Why ask such a question? Why not also ask how many Arabs over the age of 60 were born between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea?\n \n Israeli PM Sharon is a native-born Palestinian, while PA President Arafat is a native-born Egyptian. What will you make of that?\n \n The undeniable truth is that Jews have lived in the Land of Israel continuously since before the name \"Palestine\" even came into existence. During centuries of Ottoman rule the region of Palestine was very lightly populated and mostly in decline.\n \n Due to the advent of photography in the 19th century, there is now a visual record of such holy places as the Dome of the Rock situated on the Temple Mount. Though purportedly the third most holy site of Islam, the photos reveal the overall disrepair and lack of use. \n \n In view of your question posed above, it's worth noting that Jews became a plurality in Jersualem around 1820. The official Ottoman census of Jerusalem in 1844 showed 7120 Jews, 5760 Muslims, and 3390 Christians. That's consistent with the evidence from 1820.\n \n From the time of the 1844 census to the present, there has always been more Jews in Jerusalem than Muslims. Large scale Jewish immigration during the Ottoman period made the Jewish community a significant presence. It was only after Jewish settlers bought land and made the area economically productive that the Arabs returned in significant numbers.\n \n It's no secret that many Arabs who claim Palestinian identity are the descendents of recent migrants. Indeed, the official UN definition of a Palestinian refugee requires a mere two years of residency in Palestine. Why do you suppose there is such a lax standard for a people who allege a long, continuous history with the region. The UN's peculiar definition further considers a Palestinian refugee to be any descendent of someone who lived in Palestine from 1946 to 1948.\n http://www.un.org/unrwa/refugees/whois.html\n \n This produces the bizarre result that most of the 4+ million refugees registered by UNRWA have never seen the homeland they long for. Meanwhile, the number of refugees as calculated by UNRWA grows daily, even though it's been 55 years since the war. The UN bureaucracy is milking the system for all it's worth, with the U.S. taxpayer being the largest donor to finance UNRWA's budget each year. It's an example of how a temporary UN program can go haywire, a self-perpetuating bureaucracy that keeps the refugee problem growing so that UNRWA employees never worry they will work themselves out of a job.\n \n Anyway, what exactly is your point in asking how many Jews there are over age 60? Just like Arafat himself, the Palestinian masses are overwhelmingly the descendents of 19th and 20th century Arab immigration to Palestine, much like the Jews.",

   "Broker, the UN headquarters is located in New York state, sovereign U.S. territory.\n \n You are correct, of course, in refuting the contention that the UN is controlled by the U.S. Apparently Plotter slept through the most major issue to confront the UN in many years -- the U.S. effort to secure an explicit Security Council resolution authorizing the U.S. invasion of Iraq. In view of Plotter's wildly inaccurate assumptions on a variety of other issues, perhaps he also assumes (wrongly) that the introduction of U.S. military force in Iraq was sanctioned by the \"U.S.-controlled UN.\"\n \n Your reference to the UN Human Rights Commission is illuminating, especially as the U.S. was booted off the Commission in 2002, even as nations like Cuba, China, Saudi Arabia, Sierre Leone, Sudan, Syria, and Uganda held seats.\n \n One may legitimately question the constructive value of this Commission in light of the atrocious human rights record of so many of its members. These rights abusers not only retain the ability to judge others but also prevent the judgment of their own abuses. The U.S. has brought more freedom to more people than any nation in history, so one might ask why so many nations voted to exclude the U.S. from a seat on the commission.\n \n Is it any wonder that the UN is used incessantly as a forum for spreading anti-Israel propaganda?

   "Well to start, thank you for a reply.\n\n You're welcome.\n \n \nFirstly im making points and observations from a neutral point, im neither arab nor israeli.\n\n I, too, am neither an Arab nor an Israeli, so by your reasoning, my \"points and observations\" are likewise made from a \"neutral\" point of view. Either we're even on that point, or your reasoning is defective.\n \n \n \ni will make a few points, you conveneintly overlooked\n \n Were arabs killing jews before 1948\n\n Your first point was NOT overlooked but rather addressed in much detail, including reference URLs to objective online resources like Wikipedia.com as a courtesy to document my reply.\n \n Thus, you have NOT shown that I \"conveniently overlooked\" your point. You have NOT shown that Arabs didn't kill Jews before 1948. You HAVE however shown how you ignore my replies. You HAVE however shown how assumptions rule your eye, mind, and argument.\n \n Frankly, debating with you on this subject hardly seems fair, as you do not possess even the elementary facts to sustain your opinions, nor do you appear willing to avail yourself of substantial online resources that might otherwise help you to compose a truly reasonable argument.\n \n I refuse to waste time providing you with further detailed answers to your other questions until you at least acknowledge that the first question atop your list has been previously answered and that you have quite clearly ignored my detailed reply.\n \n As courtesy to other readers, I will however give a brief reply to your other points, thereby leaving the door open if anyone should wish to expand the discussion.\n \n \n \nWas there an arab jewish war before the state of israel was created.\n\n Yes.\n \n \nif you claim israel is for both arabs and jews, why have all israeli premiers been jewish.\n\n For the same reason that all American presidents have been white -- one person, one vote, and that's the way the citizens voted. Similarly, just as blacks have held elective office in Congress, have sat on the U.S. Supreme Court, and have risen to high command in the U.S. Armed Forces, so too have Israeli-Arabs held elective office in the Israeli parliament, sat on the Israeli High Court, and attained the rank of general in the Israeli Defense Forces.\n \n \nWhat pecentage of the jewish population moved to israel after 1948(over 80%) which means arabs were the vast majority.\n\n You're statement is false. The Jewish population of Israel is mostly native-born and did not immigrate after 1948, even when considering the immigration of 1 million Russian Jews in the 1990s. But even if your statement were true that 80% of Israeli-Jews are immigrants, it would not mean that Arabs were the majority. There's no logic to your conclusion because the two elements of your hypothesis have no direct relation. Whether the Arabs were a majority at a specific point cannot be determined by looking at the percentage rate of Jewish immigrants.\n \n \nWhy are there settlements on pallestinian owned land.\n\n The settlements are not on land privately-owned by Palestinians. Some of them are built on lands that have been Jewish-owned for centuries, dating back to the period of the Ottoman Empire. Some of the lands were purchased during the period of the British Mandate. Some of the settlements are built on government or public lands where sovereignty is yet to be resolved since the British Mandate ended. If you believe settlements are built on privately-owned Palestinian lands, you are obligated to provide the names of such settlements.\n \n \nJews were not the first to inhabite pallestine, others were there before them, notably greeks egyptions persions amongst others.\n\n Your timeline of history is confused and inaccurate. The Hebrews were organized into a number of tribes by 1200 BC, and King David had established his capital at Jerusalem in 1000 BC. So how could the Greeks have \"notably\" inhabited Palestine before the Jews, considering the Hellenistic period of Palestine didn't begin until Alexander marched his army into Syria in 333 BC. Your mention of the Persians is even further afield, since the Persians have never been inhabitants of Palestine. Rather, the Persians under Cyrus conquered the Babylonians and order the restoration of the Jewish community in Palestine. And when did you find the Egyptians inhabiting Palestine? More important, your question regarding the first inhabitants of Palestine is irelevant to the issue of Israel's right to exist today as an independent sovereign state.\n \n \nWhy are arabs being treated as second class citizens\n\n I don't think they are, given the circumstances. You mentioned this point previously and I addressed it and asked you for specifics, yet you raise this point again and still fail to explain yourself. My previous response still stands. The Arab citizens of Israel enjoy a higher standard of living and liberty than any Arabs anywhere else in the region. If you wish to dispute this point, then name an Arab country whose citizens live better than Israeli-Arabs.\n \n \nWhy isnt the aid pouring into israel from notably america, being given to arabs\n\n Wrong again! American aid also pours into Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian territories, and other Arab states. Regarding American aid to Israel, in 1998 Congress passed a bill phasing out the annual $1.2 billion American economic aid package to Israel over 10 years. As a result, the annual economic grant to Israel has already been cut in half and will continue to be reduced each year by $120 million until it's phased out entirely. American military grants to Israel continue in support of a strategic ally. In contrast to Israel's shared values and deep friendship with the U.S., Egypt receives annual U.S. grants of $2 billion despite the regular incitement of anti-American in the Egyptian state-controlled press.\n \n \nWhy are there so many arab refugees\n\n Because the Arabs could care less about their brethren. The Arab refugee camps were all established on Arab soil. It's shameful that the Arab leadership allows it, but it's understandable in view of the fact that if the Arabs were to resolve the Palestinian refugee problem, then the Arab leaders would have no excuse as to why they keep their own Arab masses mired in poverty and lacking basic human rights. Look at the way the Arab leadership treats its own citizens. Look at the way Palestinian refugees in Syria and Lebanon, for example, are treated.\n \n The UN's agency for refugees is UNHCR. Here's the home page:\n http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home\n Here's a link to the statistics page with a table showing the origin of major refugee populations:\n http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendoc.pdf?tbl=STATISTICS&id=3d075d374&page=statistics\n Why do you think the Palestinian refugees don't appear in that table?\n \n \nPress censoreship\n\n Not everyone buys into your conspiracy theory that the Israeli government wield vast power to censor the U.S. media. You have illustrated that you can't tell the difference between antisemitism and legitimate criticism of Israel. You have not shown that Israel censors the U.S. media or even the Israeli media. Ironically, the Arab media in Israel is the most vibrant Arab media anywhere in the world because of Israel's press freedom.\n \n \nNow you dont have to be a genius to see that israel was only set up as a refuge for persecuted jews at the expense of the pallestinians.\n\n The Nazi persecution was certainly a factor in the UN decision to divide Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state. But wasn't at the expense of the Arabs. The territory allotted for the Jewish state had a Jewish majority. The Arabs were given a state alongside. You blame the Palestinian Jews for a war started by the Palestinian Arabs. The Arab war against the Jews was the very first breach of the UN Charter.\n \n \nthe only reason you dont like the U.N. is because they make resolutions against israel which embarasses the pro israeli side, and you will find any opportunity to attack the U.N.\n\n Listen, you're not my spokesman, so don't be so arrogant as to think I need you to voice my reasons. Pay attention to better expressing your own opinions. In my view, the UN resolutions don't reflect badly on Israel but on the UN itself. No one in the UN abides by resolutions unless they want to. Or unless they're forced to. Ignoring UN resolutions is a grand tradition.\n \n Who started that tradition? The Arabs of course, those champions of hypocrisy who rejected General Assembly Resolution 181 in 1947. Nearly two dozen Arab states are members of the UN but not a single democracy among them. That helps to explain why so many Palestinians (and Arabs in general) are impressed with Israeli democracy. And why Arab leaders find Israel such an irritant. \n \n \nNow is there any way you can comment on those points without resorting to propoganda.\n\n Proabably not, since it appears anything that disagrees with your view is propaganda. However, it's worth noting that you have yet to point out a single factual error in any of my posts. Furthermore, even when I directly address your points in detail, you pretend I'm intentionally ignoring you. Count the times you have resorted to that tired refrain that your points are being 'overlooked.' I am content that careful readers will readily discern who in fact is doing the overlooking. \n \n \nThe irony is im arguing the pallestinian side with you, but on another debate im arguing for the israelis side.\n\n The real irony is that you just spotlighted your inconsistency. After several earlier claims that you posts represent a \"neutral\" point of view, you now admit you are arguing the Palestinian view. Whatever you wish to call your point of view, it does not hide the fact that you have no facts to support your statements.",

   "Youve quoted historical events, and you inerpreted them you way, i dont think an arab would agree with you.\n\n Not one? Not even your colleague in journalism, Joseph Farah? You seem unaware some Arabs are very unhappy with the sad state of the Arab world and the fact there is no democracy among the 22 Arab states. It apparently will come as a surprise to you that Arabs like Farah are content to openly support Israel. Here's a column he wrote this month entitled, \"Why Palestinian statehood is a mistake.\"\n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=36412\n Here's another he wrote two years ago asking, \"Where are Arab peace marchers?\"\n http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=27382\n And another two years before that, called \"Myths of the Middle East\"\n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=15066\n You may be assuming falsely that an Arab would not agree with me. Since you not an Arab, it might be more appropriate for you to speak only for yourself.\n \n You also wrote that I mention historical events and interpret them my way. Why be so vague? Are you not able to name one or two of the \"historical events\" you have in mind, then offer your own different \"interpretation\"? \n \n \ntheres always two sides to the story, history can be read as meaning two different things, as the victors always write history.\n\n I can agree there is more than one side to any dispute and likely more than two sides. Typically there are multiple understandings that range a broad spectrum between the extremes. As for the victors always writing history, I can't quite agree. When major events produce 'winners' and 'losers', it's true that we're more likely to find sources written by the 'winners', designed to show why they were heroic in their victory. But 'losers' write history too. Or do you think German and Japanese children study history books written by Americans? I suggest that if find something of personal interest but that there's no truly satisfying interpretation, then you should go ahead and pen your own. Really, you're allowed to do that. You're a journalist, after all.\n \n \nYour right, im no historian, so i dont know every fact of every historical event\n\n Not even an historian can know every fact of every event. Your statement seems designed to distract attention from the fact that you posted grossly inaccurate assertions that you can't support. The fact that no one can know everything does not excuse you posting misstatements of fact. You're entitled to be wrong in your opinions, but you've no right to be wrong in your facts.\n \n You're a journalist, after all, so stand up like one. You're in a public forum, so if you wish to make 'factual' statements, I suggest the prudent thing is to check the record to be sure you know what you're talking about and that you have at least one reliable source to substantiate your assertion. Or perhaps you simply feel the anonymity of cyberspace frees you to be careless regarding your journalistic credibility and professional integrity?",

   "What i do know though is that israel DOES use the jewish lobby amongst other means to attempt to \"bury\" reporting or avoid potentially damaging reports, how do i know this? im a journalist.\n\n You make it sound like a major revelation that lobbyists for Jewish interests do what ALL lobbyists do. They advocate their point of view, of course. Do you think lobbying is somehow a sinister function, even though every 'mom' and 'apple pie' interest in the U.S. uses lobbying? Are you suggesting that Jews be singled out and denied the same rights given to other special interest groups -- be it colleges and universities, churches, charities, public interest or environmental groups, senior citizens organizations, even state, local or foreign governments. If you find such lobbying to be abusive, speak up and be specific about your charges. Meanwhile, you should know that lobbying is as ancient as the institution of government itself. And in contemporary America it remains a legitimate and necessary part of our democratic political process. It doesn't take a journalism degree to know that, just someone who didn't skip his or her civics class in high school.\n \n \n \nI know of many instances where colleages were asked to tone down or change certain articles they wrote, as they may be considered anti semitic,\n\n The content in your colleagues' articles is perhaps 'considered' antisemitic because it *IS* antisemitic.

Or are you afraid these sources actually state the real facts.\n \n Good try, but im afraid yur wasting your propoganda effort on educated people, but sharon will still send you your cheque.\n \n Now lets go back, i was having a discussion with broker about the war and i was saying that the pallestinians had a right to fight, As i also believe the israelis have a right to fight.\n \n On another thread, someone, like you, but obviously an arab supporter, stated that israel should cease to exist and that the arabs had a right to anihilate israel, i disagreed with him and argued for the israeli side that israel has a right to exist and that some compromise should be found.\n \n Now reading what he has to say, and what you have to say, im afraid as long as there are people like you and him about, no settlement will ever be reached.",

   "Take that harmeless art exibition in sweden,\n\n Yes, take it! Please!!! As host of the international conference on genocide, the Swedish government should have honored their word to keep the Israeli-Palestinian dispute off the agenda of the conference. The goal of course was to prevent the Durbanization of the conference. As you may recall, the 2001 UN Conference on Racism in Durban, South Africa erupted into an antisemitic hate-fest so virulent that Colin Powell was compelled to withdraw his delegation \"with regret,\" explaining that you cannot combat racism with conference declarations containing hateful language. In the interest of avoiding a recurrence of what happened at Durban, Sweden made an agreement and was obliged not allow that particular art exhibit to be linked to the genocide conference.\n \n Personally I don't agree with the Israeli ambassador's decision to literally pull the plug on the exhibit. His reaction was emotional and undiplomatic, a form of protest not befitting his position as ambassador. But the greater faux pas belongs to Sweden, not only for reneging on their agreed obligation but for the wretched explanation that artistic freedom is what prevented them from temporarily closing a featured exhibit that glorifies Palestinian suicide bombers.\n \n The Swedish government has good relations with Israel, but I think they erred in allowing conference organizers to invite a pro-Palestinian artist to exhibit his work in which a female terrorist is portrayed to be as pure as Snow White. Hanadi Jaradat was not innocent. She was an Islamic Jihad suicide bomber who slaughtered 21 Israelis in a Haifa restaurant. To champion such an exhibit under the rubric of artistic freedom is outrageous, especially at an international conference of genocide where suicide bombers should rather be condemned.\n \n Your comment that the exhibit is \"harmless\" is not really surprising, given your narrow perspective. No doubt when you go out to dine in public you can enjoy your meal without fear of being literally blown to bits, such that your relatives might have to scrape pieces of your flesh from every which direction. In Israel, however, such danger is real and palpable.\n \n 'Harmless' you say? You should see what the Palestinians in Gaza are saying about the exhibit. \"It captures the BEAUTY of being a terrorist.\" The work is considered an incitement to violence, since it clearly encourages more terror in Israel. \n \n It may even encourage more violence in Sweden. Consider the 57% rise in reports of antisemitic acts in Sweden, including ruining cemeteries and vandalizing synagogues. Sweden is the 6th-ranked country in Europe in antisemitic acts, after France, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Spain. Though you may find it easy to discount the exhibit as harmless, the Jews in Sweden are afraid, especially as the increasing incidence in antisemitism coincides with a dramatic rise in the Arab population in Sweden. Those are facts, yet I repeat that I do not approve of the Israeli ambassador's action to tamper with the exhibit.\n \n The right of an artist's free speech is strongly protected in Israel. But even in the U.S. free speech has its limits. If you use that right to encourage incitement to violence or to endanger the public safety, then the law correctly places security and personal safety above the right to free speech.",

   "The problem isnt jewish, its israel, most people see that state as being a problem\n\n You can't separate the State of Israel from the Jewish people, so if you have a problem with Israel, you also have a problem with Jews.\n \n I am reminded of the words of Martin Luther King: \"When people criticize Zionism, they mean Jews--make no mistake about it.\"\n http://christianactionforisrael.org/antiholo/ml_king.html\n \n Go ahead and criticize the Jewish state. Israelis do it routinely, so why shouldn't you. But when criticism calls into question Israel's right to exist, then it has crossed the line into antisemitism or anti-Zionism or however you want to label it. \n \n The conflict in Israel is not about the refugees, or the settlements, or the separation wall, or whether Sharon is the moral equivalent of Arafat. The conflict fundamentally is still about the right of the Jews to have their own state, and to live in it in peace and security. The conflict will end when Arab rulers accept Israel's existence as a permanent feature of the Mideast landscape.\n \n Meanwhile, Arab leaders who use Jew-hatred to distract their populations from their own nations' lack of freedom perpetuate the Arab war against Israel. That strategy has enabled them to stay in power, but it also fostered a terrorist culture now beyond their control, as we now see in Saudi Arabia. Attempts to appease this terrorist mindset by pressuring Israel will continue to be futile.\n \n The assault on Israel from the Arab world and in much of the international media has as its goal, not the changing of some Israeli policies, but the delegitimization of Israel. Many in the media who engage in criticism of Israel are quick to point out that they are not antisemitic, just anti-Zionist. I am strongly opposed to reckless accusations that all journalists who are critical of Israel are antisemites, but still the anti-Zionist dodge must be exposed. \n \n Anyone who isn't willing to allow the Jews the same rights of self-defense and sovereignty granted to other people is a Jew-hater, not a legitimate critic.\n \n \n \nMy point comes through by you suggesting im anti semitic by criticizing israels political aproach\n\n You cannot show where I made any such suggestion. Nor have I even implied indirectly that you're an antisemite. My words speak for themselves, and frankly so do yours, so let's not read more into them than what is actually there. \n \n Furthermore, even if I did suggest that you are an antisemite, it would never be the reason you cited, since criticizing Israel's government policies or political approach is a thoroughly legitimate expression. I am critical of some Israeli policy decisions and laws, just as I don't approve of some American policies and laws. For example, just this week I find myself opposed to Israel's decision to implement the lopsided prisoner exchange with the Lebanese terrorist organization Hezbollah.\n \n As a courtesy, however, I did earlier provide you with three parameters of how to judge when criticism of Israel crosses the line into antisemitism. You may want to revisit that message if you're still uncertain what I mean and if it's your desire not to be inadvertently mistaken for an antisemite.",

Please don't be offended by what I say, I only want you to see the problems in your arguements. It seems crystal clear to me that you are doing exactly what you accuse Gator of. \n \n For instance, it seems to me that calling Gator's sources propaganda, without giving any reason why can only mean that you are in fact using propaganda yourself...\n \n \n HOW TO SPOT PROPAGANDA \n \n \n TESTIMONIALS - Famous or influential people tell you why they use a certain product, are voting for a certain candidate, or are supporting a certain project or concept. For example, a person who is respected by teens is seen in an ad that tells about the dangers of smoking cigarettes or the value of joining a project to clean up the environment. Someone who is not known, but can easily be associated with a product or concept, tells an audience how a certain product made their hair thicker or helped them lose weight quickly. Or, a person easily recognized as a member of the clergy might be promoting a moral message. \n \n \n GET ON THE BANDWAGON - These messages tell you that \"everybody is doing it\" and you should join in. The technique is often used by organizations that are recruiting new members or participation in a specific activity. For example, you might be told that \"everybody\" is participating in a charity walk to raise money for a good cause, or to boycott a product to protest the abuse of workers. The message is often loud and repetitious. \n \n \n NAME CALLING - Sometimes this negative technique is used to label a specific person and other times to generalize about a certain type of person or member of a certain group. A political candidate might say that his/her opponent is careless with public money or that everyone in his/her opponent's political party is careless with public money. The tactic is commonly used to gain support for controversial foreign policy initiatives. This technique is often used to insult all people of a certain race, religion, ethnicity, or age. For example, \"teen-agers today are irresponsible and weird.\" The technique is often used to suggest that people from a certain nation are all terrorists or all pacifists. \n \n GLITTERING GENERALITIES - This technique uses slogans or simple phrases that sound good but provide little or no information. A politician might say, \"A vote for me is a vote for peace,\" without explaining how peace would be achieved. The technique might be used to sell a new \"miracle\" product using a slogan like, \"You will feel ten years younger,\" but without explaining how it could make you feel younger. Catch phrases like \"family values\" or \"communists\" might be used to promote home, freedom, or patriotism without any information that tells you what the connection is between the catch phrase and the outcome that is promoted. \n \n \n PLAIN FOLKS APPEAL - This technique is used to build trust. People are expected to assume that someone in a simple setting can be trusted and should be listened to. For example, a simply dressed senior citizen might tell you to vote for a certain candidate because she is one of \"us plain folks,\" or the \"little guy.\" Or they may tell you that a product that comes in a (professionally designed) \"simple\" wrapper is best for you. Educators might use this technique to promote good old fashioned \"hard work\" to succeed as a student. \n \n \n CARD STACKING - This technique is used to show favoritism. Larger print, bigger or more attractive pictures, or a more attractive presentation of certain people or ideas are used to influence you. A newspaper might use a large picture of a smiling spokesperson for an organization that they favor, or a less attractive and smaller picture of a person speaking on behalf of a position they do not endorse. \n \n \n LOADED LANGUAGE - Depending on the agenda of the person providing the report, the same person, group, or event can be made to sound better or worse. An understanding of this technique enables us to see that some phrases that appear to be neutral descriptions can actually imply a value judgement. For example, if you favor a group and their agenda, you might call them a \"public interest advocacy group.\" If you don't like them they can be called \"lobbyists.\" Or in international affairs, the same group could be described as \"fighting for independence\" or \"freedom fighters\" if you agree with their cause, or as a \"separatist movement\" if you don't.\n\n http://www.esrnational.org/whatispropaganda.htm\n \n Now, I would say that you have been guilty of \"name calling\" and \"glittering generalizations\". I would also like to note, the 'how to spot propaganda' definition noted that \"testemonials\" are often loud and repeditious. I think this applies to any of the types listed as well.\n \n \n I made valid points in earlier posts and he/she has avoided even to attempt to answer them without resorting to biased propoganda.\n \n im assuming witha name like gator its a he, so he has made no real effort to prove his point, all he does is resort to propoganda.\n\n \n The first thing that comes to mind is that you have been very repetetive about calling Gator's arguments 'propaganda'. I don't think that this would make what you're saying propaganda, except - you also give no information or reason as to why it is propaganda. This qualifys as a \"glittering generalization\" - you say this but give no evidence/reason. \n \n This quote could also be seen as name calling, which brings me to another part of your reply:\n \n \n ...he is so pro israeli that nothing anybody says will persuade him/her to change there views... \n \n in fact to him anybody who doesnt agree with his propoganda is anti semitic.\n \n Why does he think like that? Why do people resort to a form of blackmail to prove there biased point....\n\n \n I see definate \"name calling\" here. Gator is so inflexible, nothing will change his/her view. Gator calls everyone who disagrees with him/her 'anti semitic'. Gator is biased and resorts to blackmail to prove his/her points.\n \n I would like to note that name calling is fine as long as there are reasons for it. What are your reasons? So far the only thing you've said to back your name calling and glitteringly generalized statements that Gator is inflexible, biased, a propagandist, etc... is that Gator is \n \n \n\"so pro israeli that nothing anybody says will persuade him/her to change there views\".\n\n \n I would like to note that this statement in itself is a glittering generalization and also name calling as it is saying that Gator is inflexible in his/her views yet you have given no information as to why this is true.\n \n This concludes my critique of your arguement. It seems clear to me that what you have said in your latest reply, as well as much or all of the rest of your replies is all progaganda. Do you agree? What is your honest opinion?\n \n I would also like to argue that many or all of the things you have said about Gator apply to you. \n -You have said that he/she resorts to propaganda. I feel that I have shown that you have been resorting to progaganda. Gator, on the other hand, has replied with logical and historical arguements, or so they seem to me. Why are Gator's arguements incorrect?\n -You have said that he/she calls others names when they disagree or refute him/her. I have noted that you have indeed called Gator names in this case without giving reasons. It seems clear to me that it is you who has been refuted by Gator, and you who is calling names here. Gator, however, has not done so to the best of my knowledge.\n -It seems to me that your 'versions of history' are not based on facts, something which Gator argued before. You said that other civilizations had been there before even the Isrealites, and he argued that the ones you had stated were not there before them, also arguing that that particular point didn't have signifigance. I have not seen any response from you on that point, and therefore conclude that Gators history is valid since it has been unchallenged by you, and I see nothing wrong with it as well.\n -finally, and most remarkably, you have said that Gator makes 'no real effort to prove his point'. You have not responded to anything Gator has said except by using progaganda against him (as far as I have seen). This is the laziest possible arguement. In contrast, Gator has replied to every point you've brought up, as far as I've seen.\n \n Either I've missed something, or you are clearly losing the arguement and using progaganda in retaliation. I know what its like to be losing an arguement. I realize that it is tempting to use lazy arguementive style and avoid facing my opponents arguements. So, I empathize with you, and hope you will see that you are doing the very things you are accusing Gator of. Please, either concede the debate, or argue Gator's points and counterpoints.",

You reciprocated by answering none of my questions but resorted to ad-hominen attack.\n \n \n \nYour attempts to answer the points i made are simply laughable and your intepretation of history is pure fantasy\n You are entitled to be wrong in your opinions. The glaring fact remains that you have yet to point out a single factual error in any of my posts. I'm not claiming I didn't err, only that you are unable (or unwilling) to say in plain English where I specifically errred.\n \n \n \n I have to admit, ive shown your responses to a friend of mine, we havent had such a great laugh in a long time your versions are absurd and quite comical.\n You should get the facts first. You can always distort them later.\n \n \n \n But we also started thinking how easy it is to brainwash people, because whichever way you look at it, im afraid you are brainwashed.\n If you and your laughing friend are two examples of unwashed brains, then I quite pleased that mine is washed.\n \n \n \n One small note to prove my point, you quote websites to prove your point, why are these sites biased, why dont you quote neutral sources?\n You neglected to mention what \"point\" you intended to prove with your \"one small note.\"\n \n You did however prove a point, though no doubt it was unintentional. You have proved you can't recognized a neutral source. Look at the URLs I provided:\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron#1929_Massacre\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupied_Palestinian_territories\n http://www.un.org/unrwa/refugees/whois.html\n http://abcnews.go.com/sections/wnt/World/saddam_bribery030520.html\n http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home\n http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendoc.pdf?\n \n Half of them are UN web sites. What's your problem with the UN. I thought you were fond of that organization. The URLs to Wikipedia are as neutral as you can get. The ABC News link was simply to confirm that UN officials did publicly concede that the amount of money improperly skimmed from the Oil for Food program was in fact in the billions of dollars and not merely a \"drop in the ocean\" as you stated.\n \n The other two web sites I posted were for the specific purpose I stated at the time. Obviously there weren't intended as ongoing reference sources. \n \n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=36412\n The link to Joeseph Farah's column at World Net Daily was simply to illustrate your error when you said an Arab would not agree with my views.\n \n http://christianactionforisrael.org/antiholo/ml_king.html\n This link was simply to give access to the full text of Martin Luther King's \"Letter to an Anti-Zionist Friend.\"\n \n Your aversion to informative URLs makes it appear you have no appreciation for learning more about this conflict from reliable sources.\n \n \n \n Now lets go back, i was having a discussion with broker about the war and i was saying that the pallestinians had a right to fight\n Maybe they felt think they had a God-given right to fight, but the fact remains that the Arab war on the Jews that started in 1947 was a violation of the UN Charter. International law did not give them the right to fight.\n \n Furthermore, the Palestinian leadership under Arafat renounced the path of violence in 1993 when Israel and the PLO signed the Declaration of Principles which allowed Arafat to return from exile in Tunisia for the purpose of leading his people to build a prosperous society. In Article XV it is clear that the Palestinians do not have the right to fight, as it states that disputes are to be settled by negotiation.\n http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/isrplo.htm\n \n \n Who walked away from the negotiating table at Camp David? Clinton laid the blame at Arafat's feet for the collapse of the negotiations.",

It's only a name, nothing more.\n \n On the other hand the name Palestine has historically served a useful purpose as a secular reference to the territory on the eastern Mediterranean coast, occupied in biblical times by the kingdoms of Israel and Judah.\n \n The Romans popularized the name in the 2nd century after the Second Jewish Revolt. Judaea was renamed Syria Palaestina, and Jerusalem was renamed Aelia Capitolina in an effort to break the Jewish identity with the land.\n \n Thereafter, the name Palestine survived as a secular reference in contrast to names that have religious implications, such as Eretz Yisrael (Land of Israel) or Terra Sancta (Holy Land).",

   "I hope you don't mind, Gator, if I could answer the question, as I have just argued a similar topic on a different thread. \n \n \n...it just isn't true that Isreal is occupying Arab territory.\n \n The history of the reigon goes like this: The Ottoman Empire owned it, and then the British took it in WWI. The British wanted to get out, and left it up to the UN to decide what to do with it. The UN proposed giving some of the land to the jewish people as the state of Isreal, and the rest would make up a Palestinian state. \n (map here: http://christianactionforisrael.org/images/1947.jpg )\n \n However, the Arabs refused to recognize these borders. Shortly after Isreal was created, the Arab nations attacked. (Isreal defeated them somehow!) During the Arab invasion, they occupied West Bank and the Gaza strip.\n \n Later, Isreal was again attacked in the six day war. They defeated the Arabians, and took back the West Bank and Gaza strip.\n \n Quote:\n \"On 10 June 1967, at the end of six days of fierce fighting ... a cease-fire was reached. Previous cease-fire lines were now replaced by new ones - the West Bank of the Jordan River, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula and a large part of the Golan Heights had come under Israel's control as a result of the war. Syria could no longer use the Golan Heights to launch artillery bombardments on Israeli homes below. The passage of ships to Israel through the Straits of Tiran was ensured.... Israelis believed that a new era was beginning, one that would bring peace to the region. Hoping to translate military gains into a permanent peace, Israel sent out a clear message that it would exchange almost all the territory gained in the war for peace with its neighbors.... But Israel's hope for peace was quickly dashed. The Arab states began to rearm and, at the August 1967 Arab League meeting in the Sudan, adopted as their political position \"the three nos,\" principles by which the Arab states were to abide, namely, \"no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it.\" \"\n ( http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/go.asp?MFAH0n1m0 )\n \n",

   "Are you insisting that pallestine never existed?\nIt depends what you mean by 'Palestine.' If you mean to refer to an political entity, then no, Palestine has never existed as an independent nation state. \n \n If, however, you rather refer to the territory at the eastern edge of the Mediterranean Sea, then of course Palestine has existed for millions of years, since before the dawn of recorded history. After all, continental drift is a very gradual process. The Mediterranean Sea is not scheduled to disappear until the northern movement of the city of Los Angeles causes it to join with San Francisco, so don't expect Palestine to move anytime soon. \n \n \n \nYou want to go back in history... you attempt to change the subject\nIt wasn't my choice to go back in history, nor did I attempt to change the subject.\n \n On the contrary, I was responding to your reference to history when you offered this simple \"fact\" in message #99:  \"Im just pointing out 1 simple fact, before israel there was a pallestine\"\n \n Though it was \"simple\" for you to say, it's apparently not simple for you to rationally explain. Here's a hint: your difficulty stems from the fact that you're trying to draw a strict analogy between a political entity (Israel) and a geographical entity (Palestine). You have to be more consistent if you're to ever make sense on this point.\n \n Numerous names have been used over time to refer to the territory at issue: Canaan, Eretz Yisrael, Syria Palaestina, Levant, Zion, Holy Land, Terra Sancta, and so on. Given the undisputed fact that Israel existed 3000 years ago as the seat of national independence of the Jewish people, one would think you might concede that it is senseless to argue from the standpoint of history that 'Palestine' existed before 'Israel.'\n \n It's fine with me if you want to drop the idea of trying to use history to show Palestine existed before Israel, but if you find it important to continue insisting there's no problem with your 'simple fact', then my question still stands:\n \n To the best of your knowledge, please tell readers the first instance in the history of the world that the name 'Palestine' was used.\n \n Then tell readers the first instance in history that the name 'Israel' was used.\n \n \n \nif you bothered to read my last post you will see I ANSWERED your question.\nNo, you merely \"ANSWERED\" with another question, which of course is not any answer at all, but rather a transparent dodge. Let me refresh your memory of your answer in Msg #106: \"I want to ask you a simple question... What was the land called before israel was created... Now if you manage to answer such a simple question, that would also answer your question.\"\n \n You did say, \"before Israel was created,\" so I offered 'Canaan' as the answer because Israel was created over 3000 years ago and there are simply not many names associated with Palestine that predate the name 'Israel.' \n \n If you believe that you \"ANSWERED\" the question by asking a question that I subsequently answered with 'Canaan,' then I must assume you now agree with me that your original 'simple fact' was in error and that the entity 'Palestine' did not exist before 'Israel.'\n \n \n \nYou also ignored the statement i made about kurds, why?\nAs noted earlier, I purposely limited my reply so as not to give you any excuse for diverting your attention from explaining your earlier comment.\n \n When you show yourself inadequate to handle just one brief question from me, what would be the point of noting your further misconceptions about the Kurds and Kurdistan?\n \n But since you now ask for specific feedback, here you go:\n \n \n \ntheres a group of people called kurds, they once had a country called kurdistan\nWhy do you say, \"once had\"? You may be shocked to learn that the Kurds still have a land called Kurdistan, and it's still in the Zagros and Taurus mountains where it has been for millenia. Unlike the 'invention' of Palestinians in the last 50 years, the Kurds have occupied their mountains since prehistoric times. By the way, they are chiefly agriculturalists, not nomads.\n \n \n \nlegally they have no country.\nNot true. The inhabitants of Kurdistan are legally citizens of whatever nation is the sovereign power where they live. I'm not sure what your point is here, but you are mistaken regarding the legal status of the Kurds. The Tibetans have no political independence in view of the Chinese occupation, but that doesn't mean they have no country. The Druze live in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Israel, but no one argues that they legally have no country.\n \n \n \nWhat was the land called before the state of israel was created?\n You're rehashing an already-answered question. The land was given many different names by different people. What you refuse to admit is that the idea that Palestinians form a distinct people is relatively recent.\n \n The Arabs living in Palestine had never had a separate state. Until the establishment of Israel, the term Palestinian was used by Jews and foreigners to describe the inhabitants of Palestine, but it was rarely used by the Arabs themselves; mostly they saw themselves as part of the larger Arab or Muslim community. But after 1948-and even more so after 1967-for Palestinians themselves the term came to signify not only a place of origin but, more importantly, a sense of a shared past and future. It was only then that the Arabs of the West Bank and Gaza began widely using the term Palestinian to indicate the nationalist concept of a Palestinian people and, after 1967, of a Palestinian state.\n \n Open any respectable referrence book like Encyclopaedia Britannica and you will see for yourself. Furthermore, check the Arab documentary record from the period of the British Mandate or Ottoman Empire and see if the Arabs referred to themselves as Palestinians. They didn't, and that's why you can't find any evidence they did.\n \n Now unless you want to debate like a man instead of dismissing everything as propaganda, I'm finished with you. Don't send me any more of your questions until you show the intellectual maturity to answer one of my own.",

   "IMHO, some of the posters in the many threads on this subject should consider digesting UN Resolution 181 and then study specific historical events leading up to that resolution before stating opinions on the current conflict. Many of the posts I'm reading are obviously based on emotional support for XXX, due to a variety of reasons including ethnic pregidous, media reporting and US Patriotism and policy, and defy response because emotion seldom allows room for rational discussion. It goes back to the fact that one should know a subject well enough to discuss any of the various viewpoints or search for grounded references to substantiate an opinion? \n \n Wait!

They were not \"relocated\" and their ancestrial homes given to new settlers. If Israel did not treat the palestenians as second class citizens, perhapse there would not be these problems now.

   "First of all, Hebrews and Muslim Arabs BOTH held large areas of present-day Israel and the West Bank. The Balfore declaration called for a simultaneous creation of an Israli state and a Palestinian state. The U.N. drew VERY confusing borders based on populations of each group. Neither country would have been contiguous and the land area was roughly equal.\n \n When Harry S Truman recognized Israel (giving it legitimacy) the Arab countries (Palestine never declared itself a state. That would have ment they accepted the borders.) decided to invade Israel and put an end to a country because of its religion. \n \n The \"Palestinians\" who currently (still) live in refugee camps and demand the \"right of return\" were enticed and told to leave the area to avoid being killed by the Arab nations who were about to attack. (The same Arab nations that attacked Israel in 1948 were the ones who had the civilian Arabs leave their homes.)\n \n Israel was able to defend itself and defeat the five Arab armies and understandably took more territory to make their country contiguous and defendable. (Not the West Bank, Gaza, the Sinai, or the Golan Heights. Those lands were won in the \"Six-day War.\"\n \n One other thing.... Why do Muslims hate Jews so much? \n \n btw, I am not Jewish or Muslim. I wrote a paper on the history of Israel and my post is based on many sources and perspectives.

   "I too have studied the history of Israel, ancient and 20th century. As an agnostic member of a conservative Jewish family, final arguments for the legitimacy of Israel's very existence among the American Jews I'm in contact with always comes down to the emotional right of Jews owning approximately the same real estate they occupied prior to the Romans banishing them from ancient Israel. \n \n Briefly, there's no doubt in my mind that Britannia created a large mess with 'civilization' of their Mideast possessions. The real complications came when England, after being depleted by WWII, turned that mess over to UN management. As you point out; historical borders, tribal lands, trade routes and port access were ignored when England began putting her stamp of approval on the area, but it was still inhabited by a mixed group, primarily Islamic with Jewish and Christian minorities.\n \n Hitler's programs created a mass exodus of Jews, those who survived, who primarily lived in limbo in other European countries one step ahead of the Germans or relocated to Western allied nations. After the Nazi regime was defeated, Jews began relocating to Palestine and demanding their own state. Some historians feel that guilt by allied nations regarding their (Jews) treatment by Nazi Germany and the desire of many recovering European countries to rid themselves of Jewish refugees had more to do with prompting the UN to 'redistribute' the Palestine Territory than any other single issue.\n \n Abbreviated, but that redistribution forfeited a great deal of Arab lands and assets to Zionist settlers without compensation, the reason those remaining inhabitants of Palestine refused to accept the new borders and the reason Israel declared itself a state one year after the redistribution, formalized by the US and accepted by the UN. \n \n There has been no offer of compensation for those lands, even though the US has paid Egypt more than $70 billion for land 'acquired' by Israel during the ongoing conflicts. I don't find it difficult to understand why stateless Palestinians still hate Jews; land is land.\n \n Other posters on different forums have offered this example (and other, similar scenarios) of the US and Israeli image to Islamic neighbors:\n \n Imagine a small African nation being racked by genocide initiated by the superior tribe. The minority tribe, 2 million in number, speaking no English, having a belief system that excludes the Christian God and promoting death to whites that enter their property uninvited, is relocated into the entire US State of Alabama. Compensation to former residents is denied; China arms the new nation with their latest technology and hardware and supplies almost unlimited financial aid. Recipe for problems?",

   "Daewoo,\n \n Thank you for making very valid legal and moral points.\n \n Silentpoet,\n \n I think daewoo and some others have answered most of your questions, of which i agree with, if you didnt like the answers then i suggest you stop asking such questions, you have asked them on numerous occassions and you have been given answers. You keep repeating yourself by asking the same questions even after theyve been answered, you obviously dont like being told the truth, and the answers are not the ones you want to hear, so you keep repeating yourself, its now rather tedious.\n \n I have already explained the history of the region in previous posts in this thread, im not interested in pro israeli propoganda, neither am i interested in pro arab propoganda, im interested in truth and morality, something biased pro israeli supporters know nothing of.\n \n as i said before, the only arguament pro israeli supporters have, is that the pallestine was not a legal state, and that it had no recognised government, and that it had no borders.\n \n Legal state? No it wasnt a legal state, but it had inhabitants, a fact you aknowledge, these inhabitants, who had there own way of life were called pallestinian arabs, there legal rights were totally ignored when israel was set up. Upto that point they were under the control of the british, who administered the palestinian land and the pallestinian arabs.\n \n Now technically a pallestinian state as defined by modern international law never existed, that was because the area and the people were under british rule. That doesnt mean pallestinian arabs never existed.\n \n You talk about legailty, that israel was created legaly, that the land was given to them, firstly, the british may have had a legal right, but not a moral right, legality and morality are two different things. It was legally accepted then that you can overlook a population of people(pallestinian arabs) in favour for another group of people (displaced jews), its called prejudice. Just because it was legaly accepted doesnt make it morally right, many things that were once legal are now illegal and vice versa.\n \n Interesting how pro israeli supporters always use legality and the U.N charter to justfy israeli rights, but then totally ignore any modern day U.N resolutions against israel.",

   "Thank you. I thought I was doomed to hear about the moola moolas. The area called Palestine had an extremely small scattered population as has been recorded. \n\n \n THe romans sent 6 battalions of troops to palestine to take it. That is an awful lot of men to sent to take a small, scattered population, an it took the romans over 2 years to do it. \n \n \nThere was no structure to state or orginization. Besides that the land was virtually barren and uninhabited. No one had claim to the land. The British then controlled it after World War I and it was given to Israel.\n\n \n Part of it was given to Israel, part to the palestenians. IT was a stupid plan. They divided the region into 4 sections, gave one to Israel, the other 3 to the palestenians. The palestenian land was split more or less down the middle by Israel. Galilee was the 4th region (we hear about the west bank, the gaza strip, and israel, but people have conveniently forgotten about Galilee). Israel annexed Galilee early on, and THAT is why they were attacked. THe surrounding nations saw Israel as a threatafter they annexed GAlilee. When the Israelis started building up troops along theirr border, surounding nations decided they had better do something because they feared that Israel was planning to take land from them. After the war, it became apparent that they had been correct, but that little bit of history was also conveniently glossed over.\n \n \nOf course they did. Zionist orginizations bought land in \"Palestine\". This is recorded as well. If you'd like to continue to refute this then I will bring in sources. Until then I suggest you recheck yours.\n\n \n Less than half of what is currently Israel was already in the hands of the zionists. The rest belonged to the palestenians, or to nobody at all (remembering that the Arabs did not/do not have the same ideas about property ownership that westerners do).\n \n \n \nI'm not saying that your lying I'd just like a credible source for me to be able to go on this information. Could you please provide me with one?\n\n \n Here are a couple of links that discuss the populations of Palestine starting in 1860:\n \n http://www.palestineremembered.com/Acre/Maps/Story574.html\n http://www.palestineremembered.com/Acre/Palestine-Remembered/Story559.html\n \n This shows a population of 410,000 palestines in the 1860 census. This number does not account for tribal members, which made up a large part of the palestenian population. THe data from the early census is likely only city dwelling people. Of all the areas in the middle east for whic a census was performed in 1860, Palestine shows as the most populous (which supports the conclusion that the census was most likely limited to cities, since the majority of Arabs were still living a nomadic lifestyle right up until WWII). By contrast, writings by the roman general who was responsible for the conquest of palestine refers to \"hordes of cavalry that would blacken the desert for miles\".\n \n \nExcuse my ignorance but I'm having a hard time understanding this. How did they immigrate \"illegally\"? \n \n \n The British set limits ont he number of Jews that were allowed to immigrate to palestine. At the time they still planned to hold on to the region. It was a result of the illegal immigration that changed their tune. They knew that the odds of the Jews, who wanted the entire territory for themselves, living alongside the Arabs was slim to none. They could not, however, concieve of a way to split the area and give the Jews their own land (since they were still a minority in most of the areas they wanted) without having to deal with years of anonymity. THe British did the smart thing (and America could take a lesson on this one) and washed their hands of the whole mess.\n \n \n \nSee the following:\n \n http://www.yoedian.com/y/contents.php?id=9\n \"The plan backfired and Israel established itself on more land (Show on Map). Egypt annexed Gaza, Jordan annexed the West Bank.\"\n \n http://www.diplomacy.edu/Edu/kappeler/letter_no_6_en.htm\n \"In 1951 Transjordan annexed the West Bank and East Jerusalem, proclaiming an overall Hachemite Kingdom of Jordan. Egypt annexed the Gaza strip.\"\n \n http://www.unionparty.rantweb.com/V.html\n \"But Egypt annexed the Gaza Strip in 1948 and Jordan invaded the West Bank during the war and annexed the region in 1950.\"\n\n \n Wow, and such unbiased sources. The Israli governments web page says te same thing. It is revisionist history. It does allow people to say things like \"egypt has given up all claims to the gaza strip\" and sound very resonable in their arguments about why Israel should be allowed to hold onto that land in violation of international law. Unfortunatly, it is a bunh of bunk.\n \n \n \nI have provided Mark Twains visit to the region from 1867. What is your source?\n\n \n See above. HAving been to the region, I can uderstand how Twain got this impression. You could travel for days in the middle east and see nobody (in the desert, that is) You find water, and you find people. Portions of the middle east are barren, empty lands. On the othe hand, a large number of cities in the middle east have been standing on the same spot for thousands of years. Jerusalem is a good example, since it is one of the cities whose ownership is in dispute. Jerusalem has been there for thousands of years, and has always been populated. The olive groves in palestine (which are worth visiting if you ever get the chance) have often been in the same family for over a thousand years. This is why the Palestenians get more than a little miffed when the Jews bulldoze them to build tract housing.\n \n I live in Kansas, portions of Kansas are an empty, barren land. We have several counties with a population of 0. That does not mean we want a bunch of Jews mocving here and declaring an independant country, and we would most likely kill any who tried. \n \n \nSide note: I hope we can continue a thoughtful discussion\n\n \n AS do I. Some people get so emotional in debates, and it causes them to loose their heads.",
