   "One of the most common complaints I've heard from the gay pride movement over the years is that they need legal marriage for the sake of hospital visitation benefits. The typical approach is that stories to invoke sympathy are posted about a family not letting a gay lover come to the hospital, but then asserting the only fix is to give full marriage legality to gays. If someone suggests fixing that individual problem or giving civil unions as an alternative, typically they balk.\n \n Now Obama has quietly fixed the hospital visitation thing without extending gay marriage.\n \n What will the gay pride movement do now that they can't use that to argue for marriage legality? Interesting that we aren't hearing the gay pride movement celebrating this as a great thing ...\n \n As a side observation, the article itself still engages in some of the usual propaganda--saying things like \"Hospitals often bar visitors who are not related to an incapacitated patient by blood or marriage, and gay rights activists say many do not respect same-sex couples' efforts to designate a partner to make medical decisions for them if they are seriously ill or injured.\"  What the article conveniently leaves out is that gays have always had the option of setting up PoA to ensure hospital visitation rights, and a hospital CAN'T deny visitation to people with such.",

I think you're pretty lucky that there are at least other avenues to cover the more important benefit needs. We quite simply can't feasibly give 'marriage' status to any and everything that comes along that doesn't fall under the standards of marriage.
