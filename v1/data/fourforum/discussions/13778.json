   "Good question. What was the dog doing sniffing around off campus?\n\n \n Let me address Ethmi's question....\n \n It sounds like this was an organized walk through by law enforcement with an odor detecting dog-a very common practice. Dogs are trained for the detection of specific items like drugs or explosives. The Virginia Department of Corrections even has dogs trained to detect the distinct odor emitted by cell phones (which are illegal for inmates to possess). \n \n I don't know why the police did this. Perhaps they had someone call about seeing a gun, or it could have been as simple as a routine sweep for drugs and/or guns. In any event, the police did it because they can. They don't need to establish a particular justification for doing it. \n \n SCOTUS has long held that the use of drug sniffing dogs is not a search for 4th.Amendment purposes. See, for example, this clip from a Virginia case which summarizes this point:\n \n \"Regarding the appellant's claim that the dog sniff amounted to an unconstitutional search of his car, the Court found \"any interest in possessing contraband cannot be deemed 'legitimate,' and thus, governmental conduct that only reveals the possession of contraband 'compromises no legitimate privacy interest.'\" Id. at 408 (quoting Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at 123). Therefore, the Court ruled, \"the use of a well-trained narcotics-detection dog - one that 'does not expose noncontraband items that otherwise would have remained hidden from public view,' during a lawful traffic stop, generally does not implicate legitimate privacy interests.\" Id. at 409 (quoting United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 707 (1983)); see also City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 40 (2000) (\"The fact that officers walk a narcotics-detection [Page 271] dog around the exterior of each car at the Indianapolis checkpoints does not transform the seizure into a search.\" (citing Place, 462 U.S. at 707)); Brown v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 1, 6, 421 S.E.2d 877, 880-81 (1992) (en banc) (\"Nothing in the Fourth Amendment prohibits a law enforcement officer from using trained canines to augment the sensory faculties bestowed on the officer at birth.\" (citing United States v. Lewis, 708 F.2d 1078, 1080 (6th Cir. 1983))).\" Wright v. Commonwealth, 52 Va. App. 263, 270-271, 663 S.E.2d 108, ___ (2008)\n \n See also these two cases:\n \n \"The fact that officers walk a narcotics-detection dog around the exterior of each car at the Indianapolis checkpoints does not transform the seizure into a search. See United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 707 (1983). Just as in Place, an exterior sniff of an automobile does not require entry into the car and is not designed to disclose any information other than the presence or absence of narcotics. See ibid. Like the dog sniff in Place, a sniff by a dog that simply walks around a car is \"much less intrusive than a typical search.\"\" Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 40 (2000)\n \n \"In United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696 (1983), we treated a canine sniff by a well-trained narcotics-detection dog as \"sui generis\" because it \"discloses only the presence or absence of narcotics, a contraband item.\" Id., at 707; see also Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 40 (2000). Respondent likewise concedes that \"drug sniffs are designed, and if properly conducted are generally likely, to reveal only the presence of contraband.\"\"Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 409 (2005)\n \n These dog \"searches\" are very common. They are frequently used, for example, at traffic checkpoints; and when law enforcement steps up patrols in a high drug area they frequently station a drug dog unit nearby that can rush in and walk around a car that has been stopped for a traffic violation. Most dogs I have encountered are trained either for drugs or explosives, and not both. I would have expected the dog used in this incident to be a drug dog because that is the most common one I see used at schools (in parking lots and around school lockers, for example). But the article Sinjin cited suggests to me this was an explosive sniffing dog trained to find firearms and explosives. \n \n Just as an example of how laws differ from state to state, Virginia's law prohibiting possession of weapons on school property has several notable exceptions:\n \n \u00a7 18.2-308.1. Possession of firearm, stun weapon, or other weapon on school property prohibited.\n \n \"The provisions of this section shall not apply to (i) persons who possess such weapon or weapons as a part of the school's curriculum or activities; (ii) a person possessing a knife customarily used for food preparation or service and using it for such purpose; (iii) persons who possess such weapon or weapons as a part of any program sponsored or facilitated by either the school or any organization authorized by the school to conduct its programs either on or off the school premises; (iv) any law-enforcement officer; (v) any person who possesses a knife or blade which he uses customarily in his trade; (vi) a person who possesses an unloaded firearm that is in a closed container, or a knife having a metal blade, in or upon a motor vehicle, or an unloaded shotgun or rifle in a firearms rack in or upon a motor vehicle; or (vii) a person who has a valid concealed handgun permit and possesses a concealed handgun while in a motor vehicle in a parking lot, traffic circle, or other means of vehicular ingress or egress to the school. For the purposes of this paragraph, \"weapon\" includes a knife having a metal blade of three inches or longer and \"closed container\" includes a locked vehicle trunk.\"",

Following your logic the school has the authority to tell students that they can't use cellphones at all when they're within 1,000 feet of the school.\n \n Or, going by the argument you're making, the school could enforce it's zero tolerance drug policy and expel a student for taking tylenol even though they're on a public road, or in their vehicle.\n \n I'm not making this **** up either.

   "Sixteen-year-old Tudesko was expelled on November 19th for having unloaded shotguns in his pick-up truck that he legally parked on an off-campus, public street near the Willows High School campus. The high school is in a small rural community near Sacramento. The unloaded shotguns were in his truck because he had gone duck hunting in the early morning hours before school. The case has garnered significant national media coverage as an example of zero-tolerance policies run amuck. (See article in Chico Enterprise Record; see article in Sacramento Valley Mirror; see David Workman article; and see Fox News Video Interview of Tudesko and his mother at www.calgunlaws.com)\n \n The shotguns were discovered in the pick up truck by scent-sniffing dogs on October 26th during a questionable school search. Police ran the license plates and determined Tudesko was the owner, then called Tudesko out of class. Tudesko cooperated and readily told the Principal about the shotguns and his early morning hunting trip.\n \n The school first suspended Tudesko for five days, then extended the suspension indefinitely until an expulsion hearing was held. Tudesko's mother, Susan Parisio defended her son during the November 19th public hearing on his expulsion. She challenged the school district's legal jurisdiction to enforce the Education Code's prohibition of guns on campus for her son having unloaded shotguns locked in an off-campus vehicle parked on a public street. Nonetheless, Willows High Principal Mort Geivett told the local School Board that, as a matter of law, it had no choice but to expel Tudesko. The Board did just that. (Notice of Expulsion is posted at www.calgunlaws.com).\n \n Geivett claimed the school had jurisdiction over students traveling to and from school, as well as students off-campus during lunch, and that the school had jurisdiction over off campus vehicles because students could not possess firearms within 1000 feet of campus. But Geivett confused the Penal Code with the Education Code. With a number of exceptions, it is a potential criminal violation of the Penal Code, specifically the Gun Free School Zones law, to knowingly possess a gun within 1000 feet of a school. But that law has nothing to do with the sections of the Education Code Tudesko is charged with violating, which generally prohibit possession of firearms on school grounds. (Education Code sections Tudesko allegedly violalted posted at www.calgunlaws.com). Tudesko's truck was parked off school grounds. And Gary was not traveling to or from school at the time of the search of the off-campus truck. He was in class. Moreover, schools do not enforce criminal / penal statutes like the Gun Free School Zones law, the District Attorney does. And the District Attorney and Willows Chief of Police have already stated there would be no charges filed against Tudesko, likely because there was no intent to violate the law.\n \n Legal issues aside, Tudesko is in this position because of a short-sighted bureaucratic approach to enforcing the school's \"zero tolerance\" policy toward firearms, which is in many schools and cases is misapplied. (See Zero Tolerance Memo from Department of Education: http://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/ss/se/zerotolerance.asp and at www.calgunlaws.com]). Time and again these policies have resulted in a triumph of irrational political correctness over common sense and justice. Given that Tudesko had gone duck hunting that same morning with friends (hence the two shot-guns), had bird-shot loads as ammunition, had both firearms unloaded, had intentionally parked off-campus to avoid any issues, and had several people corroborate his story, school administrators should have acknowledged that the circumstances did not warrant expulsion. (See Administrator Discretion for Expulsions at www.calgunlaws.com and: http://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/ss/se/expulsionrecomm.asp)\n \n \n So Sinjin, what were you saying about the school having absolutely no choice but to expel this student? Seems that the superintendent could make the decision that the incident didn't warrant expulsion since no charges were filed, no mens rea was present, and the incident happened outside of school property.\n \n \nEC Section 48915 (a). For these offenses, the law states that the principal or superintendent may find that \"expulsion is inappropriate due to the particular circumstance.\" These significant but discretionary infractions include:\n \n * Causing serious physical injury to another person, except in self-defense\n * Possession of any knife or other dangerous object of no reasonable use to the pupil\n * Unlawful possession of any controlled substance, except for the possession of not more than one ounce of marijuana\n * Robbery or extortion\n * Assault or battery on any school employee\n \n These infractions require that the decision to expel a student be based on one of the following findings:\n \n 1. Other means of correction are not feasible or have repeatedly failed to bring about proper conduct\n 2. Due to the nature of the act, the presence of the pupil causes continuing danger to the physical safety of the pupil or others\n \n All other less serious offenses listed in EC Section 48900 also require determination of one of these findings for an expulsion.\n \n The need to determine these findings is what distinguishes zero tolerance expulsions from almost zero tolerance offenses. It should be noted that zero tolerance policies can be established for any and all violations of a school district's discipline code, but when these policies are challenged, state law supersedes school district policy.\n\n \n Care to try again?",

   "Bryan,\n You posted some great information, as usual. However, I think in this case your basis was flawed. Interquest Detection Canines is a private company brought in by the school district to conduct the search. In reading the school board meeting transcript posted by Sinjin, it doesn't appear that law enforcment was involved in the search. \n It appears to me that the school had no business searching a private vehicle on a public street.\n\n \n I did miss the private security angle. Thanks for pointing that out. I read the news article posted by Sinjin which did not say what agency ran the dog. I made the mistake of assuming it was law enforcement. But in my opinion it does not change the application of the 4th. Amendment. Government cannot contract its way out of the restrictions of the 4th. Amendment. As an example, say law enforcement shows up at a house on a domestic call and finds both the assaultive boyfriend and an angry girlfriend outside. The girlfriend tells the police \"he has marijuana in his bedroom.\" She can go get it, bring it outside, and give it to the police to get him in trouble and he has no 4th. Amendment protection from her warrantless search and seizure because the 4th. Amendment does not apply to the actions of private individuals or companies. But say she tells the police about the marijuana, and the officer says \"would you go get it for me\", and in response she does so. Now she becomes an agent of the government and the 4th. Amendment right of the boyfriend is violated. The same analogy applies to the school as a government agency. Although the student's 4th. Amendment rights are not as strong because of the doctrine of in loco parentis, the school cannot contract away the 4th. Amendment protections of individuals by using a private security agency any more than the police can.\n \n But as I have said the dog sniff is not in my opinion a 4th. Amendment protected search, and it appears the young man consented to have his vehicle physically searched-thereby potentially waiving any 4th. Amendment claim (a potentially important point later if he tries to sue the school and/or the security agency for a civil rights violation). Also, assuming the dog in question is sufficiently trained and reliable, then the dog \"hit\" on the car provides probable cause to believe there may be contraband in the vehicle and law enforcement (which was apparently called in) could search the vehicle without a warrant (see Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132 (1925) and the many cases citing it since for \"automobile exception\" to the search warrant requirement). \n \n I believe no state prosecution has occurred in this case because no state law has been violated. From the article I read it appears the boy is 16, and he possessed an unloaded shotgun and ammunition in a locked vehicle parked on a public street within 1000ft. of a school.\n \n If I were the prosecutor looking at this case, here is how I would analyze it....\n You start with the applicable criminal code:\n \n CAL. PEN. CODE \u00a7 626.9 : California Code - Section 626.9\n (a)This section shall be known, and may be cited, as the Gun-Free School Zone Act of 1995.\n \n Here is the possible crime:\n \n (b)Any person who possesses a firearm in a place that the person knows, or reasonably should know, is a school zone, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (e), unless it is with the written permission of the school district superintendent, his or her designee, or equivalent school authority, shall be punished as specified in subdivision (f).\n \n And the definition which is relevant to that crime is:\n \n (e)As used in this section, the following definitions shall apply:\n (1)\"School zone\" means an area in, or on the grounds of, a public or private school providing instruction in kindergarten or grades 1 to 12, inclusive, or within a distance of 1,000 feet from the grounds of the public or private school.\n \n He did not have written permission of the school authority, and it therefore appears his act of having the gun falls within the conduct described above. We then look to see if any exceptions apply....\n \n (1)Within a place of residence or place of business or on private property, if the place of residence, place of business, or private property is not part of the school grounds and the possession of the firearm is otherwise lawful.\n \n This does not apply because the vehicle was on a street, which is public property.\n \n (2)When the firearm is an unloaded pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed on the person and is in a locked container or within the locked trunk of a motor vehicle.\n \n This does not apply because the firearm was a shotgun and not of the type listed in this exception. There is also an exception for persons who have obtained a restraining order against someone else and who feels threatened, but that would not apply in this case. But there is another exception: \n \n This section does not prohibit or limit the otherwise lawful transportation of any other firearm, other than a pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed on the person, in accordance with state law.\n \n This applies to his shotgun, and so the question now becomes was the possession of the shotgun otherwise lawful....\n \n My (brief) research of California law leads me to believe there is no law prohibiting possession of long guns by minors. There is a law prohibiting possession of handguns:\n \n CAL. PEN. CODE \u00a7 12101\n (a)(1)A minor shall not possess a pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person.\n \n But I can find no code which limits the possession of long guns by minors, and because it appears the possession of the shotgun is \"otherwise lawful\" the young man has not violated the \"gun free school zone\" law. In fact, a fair reading of the criminal statute would have resulted in the same analysis even if the vehicle were parked on the actual school grounds. \n \n Additionally, there is a potential crime for possessing ammunition by a minor, but an exception exists which appears to cover this incident (from the same code section that made it illegal for minors to possess handguns):\n \n b)(1)A minor shall not possess live ammunition.\n (2)Paragraph (1) shall not apply if one of the following circumstances exists:\n (A)The minor has the written consent of his or her parent or legal guardian to possess live ammunition.\n (B)The minor is accompanied by his or her parent or legal guardian.\n (C)The minor is actively engaged in, or is going to or from, a lawful, recreational sport, including, but not limited to, competitive shooting, or agricultural, ranching, or hunting activity, the nature of which involves the use of a firearm.\n \n Therefore, in the final analysis, I would conclude as the prosecutor that no state law has been violated and would consider the matter as a non-criminal incident.\n \n Expulsion is in my opinion a punishment, and whether that is justified is a matter of school policy. I think it is foolish and unreasonable to expel a student for something which was not a criminal activity and which posed absolutely no threat to the safety of others.",

   "School board hears gun expulsion appeal | school, appeal, expulsion - Local News - Appeal-Democrat\n \n \nA case that has drawn national attention because of the involvement of the National Rifle Association had no mention of gunowner rights at a Tuesday morning expulsion hearing.\n \n Instead, the appeal of the expulsion of Willows High School junior Gary Tudesko, 17, turned more on the interpretation of the state education code and what discretion the school district had in the matter.\n \n The 31&#8260;2-hour hearing before the Glenn County Board of Education did not have an immediate resolution. The board is expected to issue its decision about whether Tudesko will be allowed to return to class at Friday.\n \n Tudesko's expulsion came after sniffer dogs alerted trainers to two shotguns and hunting ammunition in his pickup truck on Oct. 26. He and a friend had gone duck hunting before school. The truck was parked off campus.\n \n Susan Parisio, Tudesko's mother, appealed to the Willows Unified School board, which upheld the expulsion. The appeal then went to the county board on Dec. 16.\n \n The NRA and another gun rights group helped pay for the attorney fees to defend Tudesko. The gun rights element of the case has stirred controversy in a community with a large hunter population.\n \n Marc Juhl-Darlington, Willows Unified School District's attorney, cited the education code in support of the expulsion, claiming schools have jurisdiction over student actions on or near school grounds, while on their way to or from school or during school activities.\n \n Principal Mort Geivett told the board that based on that interpretation, he \"had no choice\" but to expel Tudesko. Tudesko's attorneys, C.K. \"Chuck\" Michel and Hillary Green, argued the school was not mandated to expel Tudesko because he did not take a gun onto school property.\n \n \"He was parked on a public street,\" Michel said, pointing out that the education code specifically states that mandatory expulsion is required for possessing guns \"at school.\"\n \n He interpreted that to mean on school property.\n \n \"Expulsion is mandatory only when an act is at school or school activity off school grounds,\" he said. \"When the dogs alerted to the truck, it was not on private property.\"\n \n A sign warning that no firearms and no alcohol are permitted on campus is \"inside the gate,\" Michel noted, explaining no such signs are posted along the street next to the school.\n \n He further argued that Tudesko was \"not in possession\" of a gun at school or during a school activity, since, when the dogs were alerted to his truck, he was sitting in class and did not have physical possession or immediate control of a gun.\n \n Darlington told the board that to keep students safe, a school's jurisdiction extends beyond school property. One question the county board has to answer, he told them, is, \"how far does the arm reach?\"\n \n A reasonable approach should have been used in deciding what disciplinary action, if any, to take, Michel said, explaining that Tudesko had been duck hunting before school is common practice in the community and that Tudesko did not present a threat.\n \n Darlington said other factors entered into the Willows school board's decision to uphold the expulsion. Tudesko has a history of discipline issues at the school.\n \n Tudesko admits to using foul language, calling teachers names, fighting and being disruptive in class. He has received 24 referrals for his behavior.\n \n The school district contended that previous disciplinary measures &#8212; detention, Saturday school and even two suspensions &#8212; have not changed Tudesko's behavior.\n \n Michel argued that none of the previous referrals related to Tudesko possessing a gun and, therefore, the application of that code does not apply. Darlington disagreed.\n \n Green also argued that students did not get a \"fair and proper notice of where the school is and where it isn't,\" so Tudesko could not have known what he was doing was wrong.\n \n Geivett said his primary concern is school safety, referring to the 340 school-related shootings in the United States since 1994.\n \n \"What if someone else took the guns out his truck and used them against someone?\" he asked.\n \n \"We have a safe campus,\" Geivett emphasized. \"(But) I'm not going to bury my head in the sand and pretend that it will never happen here.\"\n\n \n Interesting points. If the school has authority that extends beyond its physical property, just how far can it extend? Is it going to claim is has the authority to regulate matters that take place inside public housing next? Or inside grocery stores?\n \n Another interesting point. The article mentions that there's been 340 school shootings since 1994, after guns were banned from school property. That's about 21 shootings every single year, in an environment that's supposed to be safe havens.\n \n 21 shootings a year, that amounts to almost one school shooting every two weeks.\n \n How many school shootings were there before guns were banned on school property?",

The purpose of the warrantless search incident to arrest is to both make sure the arrestee is not dangerously armed and to prevent the destruction of contraband they might have on their person at the time of arrest. The valid arrest itself justifies this search without a search warrant and without any requirement that the police believe the arrestee is either armed or has contraband on him. \n \n Gant held that police cannot conduct a warrantless search of the passenger compartment of a vehicle incident to the arrest of an occupant where the arrestee is already held in custody in another vehicle and, at the time of the search, cannot reach to gain access to either weapons or contraband in the suspect vehicle. Gant reverses a trend of expanded vehicle searches incident to arrest and reverts back to the requirement that police have either reasonable suspicion that evidence of the crime the person is being arrested for exists in the vehicle, or probable cause to believe other crime evidence is in the vehicle before they can search it without a warrant. \n \n Gant has no application to this incident in my opinion.\n \n \n A person has to be informed of what rights they're afforded when they're placed under arrest or investigation by the police, otherwise the case can be dismissed. \n\n \n \n I think you're confused. Police are required to \"Mirandize\" you when you're arreted. \n Since the boy wasn't arrested or charged, the point is moot. \n\n \n I know there are a lot of movie and TV crime shows that routinely offer scenes showing officers rapidly reading a confused looking suspect his or her rights immediately after grabbing them and telling them \"you're under arrest for the murder of....\"( Starting with \"You have the right to remain silent....\"). The scene is as common as watching a TV doctor yell \"nurse, get me a suture kit STAT!\" It may be good TV, but it fuels a persistent myth-in reality there is absolutely no requirement that police advise someone of their rights when they arrest them. If I had a nickel saved for every person who was convicted after they claimed their case had to be dismissed because the police did not read them their rights I would be a rich man. Officers are required to \"Mirandize\" someone only before they begin a custodial interrogation--which often does not happen for several hours after the arrest (and often police never question them at all). \n \n If you interrogate someone without reading them their rights, making them acknowledge they understand these rights, and getting them to freely and voluntarily waive those rights, then the statement they give (and any confession within it) would be suppressed and unusable-but even then the case does not get dismissed provided sufficient evidence exists to convict them without using the confession (and evidence you find out about only because of the confession).",
