   "Innacurate;\n Young Earth Creationism (YEC) states that the Earth/Universe was created between the 11th and 18th November 4004 BC as stated in Genesis. The date having been derived from the collected ages of persons mentioned in the OT. \n Variations on the theme range out to an age of 25,000 years (Archangel; no data given of course).\n The general excuse for geological data is that it was all deposited during the Flood, (No explanation for clear stratification). The excuse for Astronomical data is that the speed of Light slowed down, (Again no reason for this)\n \n Old Earth Creationism (OEC) concedes that the geological and astronomical data are correct but maintains that all extant species have been around since day 1 (Or day 6 if you want to be pedantic) and \"Macroevolution\" does not occur, (even when it is observed).\n \n Belief that the Universe was created then Animals (+ Lifeforms including plants fungi and bacteria) evolved is THEISTIC EVOLUTION.",

   "While we're on the subject, I've managed to conclusively disprove Intelligent (sic) Design. It's actually a remarkably simple thing to do when you realise that Nature is just far too complex to have been designed.\n \n Look around you. We humans are perhaps the best designers that we know of. Look how crude are the things we make: the filthy, inefficient combustion engine; the computer, unable to make decisions of its own and unable to feel emotions; the microwave, unable to cool anything like a tasty meal. We are, at best, crude emulators of Nature.\n \n No. No designer could possibly have kept track of all the interlocking wonders of the natural world, therefore there can't possibly have been one.\n \n Also, the chances of a designer appearing ab initio in the Universe are of the order 1 in 5x10^90871. I worked it out.\n \n I'll let the Discovery Institute know.",
