   "If we, as Catholic Christians, are united in the body of Christ, then why would black Catholics feel the need to meet on their own, to hold their own congress? Why the need for separate black Catholic service organizations and for black Catholic parishes and clergy caucuses?\n \n Why the need for a separate national pastoral plan for Black Catholics? Separate national and diocesan offices?\n \n These are -- and should be -- deeply disturbing questions for Catholic Christians because they point up an unavoidable reality: The issue is racism. No matter how much we wish and talk otherwise, the Catholic family is divided and is only slowly moving toward dealing with the deep wound of racism.\n \n The ninth National Black Catholic Congress held Aug. 29-Sept. 1 in Chicago provides dramatic evidence that we are all engaged in the journey along the route of \"the already but the not yet,\" the kingdom proclaimed and in progress but not yet complete.\n \n The divide is evidence that being Catholic does not exempt us from being shaped by the worst elements of the culture. And the fundamental sins of American culture are racism and its twin, the long, ugly history of slavery. Racism and slavery are simultaneously symptom and disease. In the wider culture, they are cancers that, in their long-term effects, continue to eat at the body politic. At the same time they are symptoms of the wider, dominant culture's view of history, of its sense of superiority in relating to other cultures and to people of color and of the misery the culture is capable of unleashing in the name of that superiority.\n \n Black Catholics meet separately because they are, in a way keenly felt by the marginalized, a family. They meet separately because their experience of history has been so different from that of most white Catholics. It is a history of being ripped from homeland, of unspeakable violence, of being sold into bondage, of families and villages pulled apart. If Catholics today are concerned that life has increasingly become expendable -- from womb to death chamber to battlefield -- the attitude has been long in preparation. Black Catholics know more deeply than most how cheaply life can be viewed. \n \n But that's not the way things are today, one might argue. Mixed parishes exist all over the country and African-Americans inhabit positions of leadership in diocesan structures. There also are black bishops, pastors, theologians, hymnals and liturgies. The church, one might convincingly put it, has become sensitive to the black story.\n \n Certainly all of that is true, and this church is not the church of, say, as recent as 70 years ago where blacks went to their own churches because they were not allowed to join white parishes or, if they did, were required to sit in reserved pews in the back of the church.\n \n At the same time, it is only in recent years that some religious orders have issued apologies to black Catholics for having owned slaves during earlier centuries.\n \n The understanding required, it seems, for those outside the black Catholic family, is that progress, while evident, is slow.\n \n And that goes not only for relationships between whites and blacks but among blacks themselves, as the congress in Chicago dramatically demonstrated. In a moving and surprising gesture, Bishop Charles G. Palmer-Buckle of the Koforidua diocese in Ghana, offered an apology for the part Africans played in selling their brothers and sisters into slavery.\n \n Another understanding required for those outside the black Catholic family, it would seem, is that the wounds run deep and in a variety of directions. The healing process can't be rushed; one doesn't tell the victim of trauma to just get over it.\n \n So what to do in the meantime? Is there a way around or through this separation?\n \n Certainly, in small steps, being attentive to where we might join our efforts and our faith.\n \n One more bit of understanding that might be helpful for those outside the black Catholic family is that one of the most valuable things we might do is listen to what black Catholics are saying; read what they are writing; hear what they are preaching.\n \n \"You can go through a lot of religious studies programs and not hear of the church's teaching on racism,\" said Fr. Bryan Massingale, a moral theologian from the Milwaukee archdiocese.\n \n Black Catholics, he said during a presentation at the congress, \"must recommit ourselves to our people's historic struggle for justice in light of the Catholic social teaching tradition.\" There is no contradiction, he said, between the demands of the black struggle for justice and the core convictions of Catholic social teaching: \"the dignity of the human person\"; \"the promotion and defense of human rights\"; \"a vision of social and public life captured by the word 'solidarity' \"; and a \"central concern for the least among us, especially the poor and vulnerable.\"\n \n \"There is no contradiction here,\" he said, \"but we do sharpen the pencil a bit.\"\n \n We know the disturbing questions. Perhaps it's time to grab the pencil and take some notes.\n \n National Catholic Reporter, September 13, 2002\n \n http://www.natcath.com/NCR_Online/archives/091302/091302n.htm",

   "The numbers dying directly due to abortions may have been well have been that low. However, contemporaries and historcial demographers both attribute at least some of the high maternal mortality in England between 1900-1940 to illigal abortion, as complications appeared in later pregnancies rather than killing the women at the time. These deaths were thus not necessarily seen to be linked to abortion, and dont appear in the statistics.\n\n \n These stats refer to the US and not England..I have no idea what happened in England. \n \n \nMaybe. Maybe not. Frankly, I don't care. You still don't get to make these decisions for me (whether I i have sex, use birth control or reporoduce) - and I don't give a damn how many laws I may break to continue to own my body.\n \n Trust me boys, there ain't anything you can do about that. Period.\n And you should be able to do this even if it might hurt someone else...abortion kills another human, drinking and driving might hurt kill another human, firing a gun in the privacy of your own home might hurt someone but it is in private so I don't give a damn what someone else thinks. \n \n \n \n ----\n Anyway, I see you guys still won't admit that Planned Parenthood is wrong about the facts and is misleading women everywhere...but thats ok because you like these facts.",

She also criticized the censorship of her reproductive literacy message by the civil and religious authorities, justified on moral grounds, as an effort by men to keep women in submission. An atheist, Sanger attacked the Christian church for its opposition to her message, blaming it for obscurantism and insensitivity to women's concerns. Sanger was particularly critical of the lack of awareness of the dangers of and the scarcity of treatment opportunities for venereal disease among women. She claimed that these social ills were the result of the male establishment's intentionally keeping women in ignorance. Sanger also deplored the contemporary absence of regulations requiring registration of people diagnosed with venereal diseases (which she contrasted with mandatory registration of those with infectious diseases such as measles).\nThe preceding is from Wikipedia.\n \n Now, perchance, does \"cleaner\" possibly mean having been exposed to enough medical information to be aware of veneral diseases so as to know how to avoid them?

   "Lets look at the \"Nine Reasons Why Abortions Are Legal\" from Planned Parenthood...\n http://www.plannedparenthood.com/pp2/portal/files/portal/medicalinfo/abortion/pub-abortion-legal.xml\n \n 1. Laws against abortion kill women.\n 2. Legal abortions protect women's health.\n 3. A woman is more than a fetus.\n 4. Being a mother is just one option for women.\n 5. Outlawing abortion is discriminatory.\n 6. Compulsory pregnancy laws are incompatible with a free society.\n 7. Outlaw abortion, and more children will bear children.\n 8. \"Every child a wanted child.\"\n 9. Choice is good for families.\n \n Now we already know that numbe 1 is misleading...Number 2 is also misleading. The backing for number 2 is as follows...\n \nLegal abortion not only protects women's lives, it also protects their health. For tens of thousands of women with heart disease, kidney disease, severe hypertension, sickle-cell anemia and severe diabetes, and other illnesses that can be life-threatening, the availability of legal abortion has helped avert serious medical complications that could have resulted from childbirth. Before legal abortion, such women's choices were limited to dangerous illegal abortion or dangerous childbirth.\nNow no one is arguing here about if the LIFE of the mother is at stake...as in she will die if she has the baby. So if abortion were to become illegal this would still not change as all 50 states had an expection for life of the mother. Number 2 is misleading in this respect.\n \n Number 3 is odd...a woman is more than a fetus? I don't know what they are referring to here. I would assume they mean the pregnant woman is more than the fetus...but she isn't even the fetus to begin with. It is like me saying \"the fetus is more than the woman\"...The explanation goes on to say that the fetus is \"not a person\" because it lacks things like \"thinking, feeling, conscious human being\" which is only true in some cases. But since when does another person get to decide if someone else is a person or not? Isn't this anti-choice? Does one need to be able to think, feel, and be conscious to be a human? Dang, I am not a human every night when I go to sleep. Number 3 is also misleading.\n \n Number 4: Being a mother is just one option for women. I would say so. But It says that woman shouldn't be held responsible for \"accidents\". I guess they should get off for car accidents as well as this might cause them financial problems down the road. Number 4 is not misleading but just doesn't make sense.\n \n 5. Outlawing abortion is discriminatory. What? It says that making abortion illegal hurts poor females. First off, I am not sure of the validity of this claim. However, even if this were true I am not all certain it matters. I suppose having a murder law discriminates against poor people as well since low-income people have a higher crime rate. This kind of comes back to the idea that \"abortion will happen anyway\" which is true. But all crimes happen anyway. This one is just wrong.\n \n 6. Compulsory pregnancy laws are incompatible with a free society. This one is more of an opinion on my part. This is not so much misleading as it is looking at the wrong side of things. It says the government would be \"forcing\" a woman to bear a child. Well, no, it would be forcing the woman not to kill a child (or fetus whatever you wanna call it). Whether you bear a child or not is not something the government would be doing as this implies the government saying \"you go get pregnant right now\". \n \n 7. Outlaw abortion, and more children will bear children. This one may or may not be true...I couldn't find anything to either refute this or back it up.\n \n 8. \"Every child a wanted child.\" It claims that if abortion were illegal than the unwanted children would be left in the streets or beaten...etc. I suppose this means woman that get abortions are also very mean people...nevertheless, this claim is false. There were not that many abandoned children before or after abortion became illegal as seen in another thread here on these forums. Also, adoption exists. Another baseless claim here.\n \n 9. Choice is good for families. This says that \"accidents happen\". But once again, one still needs to be responsible for these actions. I suppose if you got in a car accident (your fault) and you decided to kill the driver (and succesfully not get caught) then you would be able to avoid any unwanted economic instability. This is just a dumb claim on PPs part.\n \n \n So that makes:\n Misleading- 3\n Baseless- 2\n Questionable- 1\n Wrong/Dumb- 3\n \n Great job helping the American public Planned Parenthood...",

So thats out. As the title of this thread says...PP is misleading people. Also, the numbers Planned Parenthood has are known to be incorrect at best.\n \nAnother stunning admission about the manufacturing of illegal abortion numbers comes from Dr. Bernard Nathanson, former director of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (now known as the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League - - NARAL). In his classic 1979 book Aborting America, Dr. Nathanson wrote, \"How many deaths were we talking about when abortion was illegal? In NARAL, we generally emphasized the frame of the individual case, not the mass statistics, but when we spoke of the latter it was always 5,000 to 10,000 deaths a year. I confess that I knew that the figures were totally false and I suppose that others did too if they stopped to think of it. But in the 'morality' of our revolution, it was a useful figure, widely accepted, so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics? The overriding concern was to get the laws eliminated, and anything within reason that had to be done was permissible.\"\n \n\n \n So PP based it on numbers that were lied about...Glad to know PP does that.\n \n \n \n I would like to note that it seems odd that you guys are changing the point of this thread. Instead of saying \"yeah, planned parenthood got it wrong\" you say \"every stat is wrong so your sites prove nothing\".

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/06/opinion/06fri3.html\n \n January 6, 2006\n Editorial\n Abortion Rights in Latin America \n For proof that criminalizing abortion doesn't reduce abortion rates and only endangers the lives of women, consider Latin America. In most of the region, abortions are a crime, but the abortion rate is far higher than in Western Europe or the United States. Colombia - where abortion is illegal even if a woman's life is in danger - averages more than one abortion per woman over all of her fertile years. In Peru, the average is nearly two abortions per woman over the course of her reproductive years. \n \n In a region where there is little sex education and social taboos keep unmarried women from seeking contraception, criminalizing abortion has not made it rare, only dangerous. Rich women can go to private doctors. The rest rely on quacks or amateurs or do it themselves. Up to 5,000 women die each year from abortions in Latin America, and hundreds of thousands more are hospitalized.\n \n Abortion is legal on demand in the region only in Cuba, and a few other countries permit it for extreme circumstances, mostly when the mother's life is at risk, the fetus will not live or the pregnancy is the result of rape. Even when pregnancies do qualify for legal abortions, women are often denied them because anti-abortion local medical officials and priests intervene, the requirements are unnecessarily stringent, or women do not want to incur the public shame of reporting rape.\n \n But Latin Americans are beginning to look at abortion as an issue of maternal mortality, not just maternal morality. Where they have been conducted, polls show that Latin Americans support the right to abortion under some circumstances. Decriminalization, at least in part, is being seriously discussed in Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela, Uruguay and Argentina, and perhaps will be on the agenda after the presidential election in July in Mexico.\n \n International pressure is helping. In November, the United Nations Human Rights Committee decided that Peru had violated a woman's rights when a hospital denied an abortion to a 17-year-old carrying a severely malformed fetus, who died shortly after birth. United Nations conferences on women also have forced governments to track and publish their progress on expanding women's rights. This has emboldened women's groups and led to the creation of government offices on women's issues, which have helped the push for abortion rights.\n \n Latin American women, who are increasing their participation in the work force and in politics, have also become more vocal. Their voice would be much louder were it not for the Bush administration's global gag rule, which bans any family planning group that gets American money from speaking about abortions, or even criticizing unsafe illegal abortions. This has silenced such respected and influential groups as Profamilia in Colombia. Anti-abortion lawmakers in Washington can look at Latin America as a place where the global gag rule has worked exactly as they had hoped. All Americans can look at Latin America to see unnecessary deaths and injuries from unsafe abortions.",

   "http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/Organizations/healthnet/SAsia/repro/aruna.html\n \n Abortion Laws in Nepal \n Dr. Aruna Uprety\n Introduction \n Nepal is one of the few countries in the world where abortion is illegal. Unsafe, illegal abortion is a major cause of maternal death in Nepal. 'The medical complications of improperly performed illegal abortions are now reaching epidemic proportions in many parts of the world, and represent a leading cause of death of women among childbearing age. From one to two hundred thousand women die each year in developing countries\" (12). In Nepal, about 4000 women die each year from illegal abortions. Abortion is not only illegal in our country - it also comes under the definition of \"homicide\" so that women go to jail in case abortion is proved. \n \n In this paper I will discuss the legal issues regarding abortion in Nepal. I will look at how this law reflects the status of women in our society through its disregard for women's right to make their own reproductive choices. I will look at how women have been affected by the laws that criminalizes abortion. I will discuss women's activities to legalise abortion and some of the obstacles facing this process. I will discuss if this will solve the problems associated with women's health issues. Finally, I will propose what should be done to ensure all women have access to safe abortions.\n \n The abortion issue has never been perceived as a health issue for the people who are in government and people who make policy. Even feminists and activists in Nepal had not raised abortion as a woman's health issue. Although some concerns have been raised by the medical community from time to time during the last twenty years, it was only after ICED and the Beijing conference that this issue began to gain momentum among women's activists in Nepal . \n \n Unsafe Abortions: A Global Epedemic\n Millions of women around the world risk their lives and health to end an unwanted pregnancy. Every day, 55,000 unsafe abortions take place, 95% of them in developing countries, which lead to the deaths of more than two hundred women daily. World-wide, the percentage of maternal deaths due to unsafe abortions is 13%, but in Nepal this figure rises to 50 percent. \n \n From the medical point of view, abortion is the termination of pregnancy and is \"legal under some circumstances in nearly all countries of the world: 96 per cent of countries recognise a threat to a mother's life as legal basis for stopping pregnancy\". (The Status of World Population, 1997: 22). Nepal is among the those 4 per cent of countries where abortion is illegal even if pregnancy is a threat to the mother's health or life. That is why no hospitals in Nepal perform abortions even as a medical procedure and for this reason women are forced to seek other methods. \n \n Historically, women have performed abortions in villages in Nepal to regulate their fertility. Many village women know some kind of traditional medicine to abort the foetus in the first 2-3 three months of pregnancy. Many village women seek the help of old women to get rid of pregnancy or go to the \"village doctor\", who may be male or female. Most of the time, pregnancies are terminated in the villages in a very brutal manner. A stick with mud or cow dung and even sometimes poison grass is inserted inside the vagina to induce the contraction of the uterus and cause the foetus to be expelled. Sometimes the abdomen of the pregnant woman is massaged with the hand or with the feet so that the foetus is expelled. One can easily imagine the condition and suffering of those women who have to suffer such a \"procedure\".\n \n How the abortion law affects women\n Nepali laws are especially harsh to women who try to abort their foetuses. In addition to imprisonment the sentence may also include the confiscation of all the woman's property. This is a provision which makes woman particularly vulnerable to false charges from greedy in-laws or other relatives. Because of these laws an estimated two thirds of the women in Nepalese jails are convicted of garbhapat (destruction of life), which is a term applied to abortion, infanticide and attempted infanticide through abandonment. \n \n Sapana Malla, a young lawyer, clearly states what Nepalese law says about abortion and infanticide. Abortion and infanticide is a crime against the state, dealt with under the homicide chapter of Muluki Ain, the Civil code of Nepal. In the case of abortion, penalty for the termination of a 6 month pregnancy is 2 years imprisonment and for pregnancy above 6 months it is 3 years imprisonment. The punishment for infanticide is life imprisonment and confiscation of property' (Kathmandu Post ,1996; 4 ) The legal definition of abortion that links it to homicide is seen in a new light: \"Bizarrely, if a woman kills her rapist within one hour of the assault, she receives legal immunity - but she goes to jail if she terminates a pregnancy resulting from the same attack.\"(Goodwin J., 1996: 18).\n \n Ironically, not a single man has been punished for abortion in Nepalese legal history. Society has forgotten the fact that men are equally responsible for the pregnancy of women. Male sexuality is never have been challenged or even questioned by the society, religion or culture and that very 'non-challenge' is reflected in the law and practice. The religious or cultural rights discourse give men more means and avenues of satisfying desires (Imam A., 1997: page 4). Additionally, while doing so, they are not held responsible for any of the acts. The whole burden of responsibility of pregnancy and abortion falls on women. \n \n (More)",

   "Three Case Studies \n Thousands of Nepali women suffer every year from dangerous back-street abortions. According to one study done by the Maternity Hospital of Kathmandu, from May 15, 1995 to August 31, 1996, 1,961 cases of abortion complications were registered. According to the history given to the doctors by the patients, only six percent of those were induced abortions but the condition in which they were brought strongly suggests more than 50 % was induced. One gynaecologist working in the hospital said, \"Most of those cases which have come to the hospital with abortion related complications, most of them done by quacks. Many come to us in a very bad condition.\" When asked if she reported the cases to the police, the doctor replied, \"We should have, but we did not do it. We don't report it to the police because sick women would have been arrested and that would add insult to injury\". (Uprety, A.,1996).\n \n Dr. Renu Rajbhandari once told the authour personally, \"6 years ago, I was working in Bharatpur Hospital. One woman was raped by a village man while her husband was away and she got pregnant. She went to a quack and something was put inside her vagina. After two days the foetus was expelled. She dug a hole and put the foetus inside it. Three days after the abortion she developed a fever, started bleeding and came to the hospital while I was on duty. By this time, a neighbour had already complained to the local police that she had an illegal abortion. The police came to the hospital and brought the woman to me and asked me to write a report stating whether she had undergone abortion or not. I talked to the woman and found out the whole story. In order to save her from the police and to save her family life, I gave the report that there had been no abortion and she had very bad infection which required hospitalisation. Of course it was not true medically but I do not feel guilty about it, because if I had not written this report the police would have taken her and her life would have been shattered.\" \n \n A 20 year-old woman with two girls, aged 3 and 1 in Butwal, a small city in the southern part of Nepal, became pregnant. She was harassed by her in-laws that again she would have a daughter. Due to this harassment and her fear of having another daughter, when she was 5 months pregnant she went to a private gynaecologist. The doctor told her that it was dangerous to have an abortion after 4 months. She was desperate to abort the foetus so she went to a woman who was notorious for performing abortions. This woman put something inside her vagina and the following day, after painful contractions, she aborted the foetus. Bleeding began and lasted for three days and thereafter she was taken to the hospital. Unfortunately, because of septicaemia and severe anaemia, the doctors could not save her. The hospital record stated the cause of death as septicaemia caused by induced illicit abortion. Before she died she told her husband about the abortion, but the family was unable to take any action, as they did not have any witnesses. (Uprety A. 1994.)\n \n In June 1996, 'Equality Now' published the case of Lok maya Adhikari, a thirty-eight year old Nepali farmer imprisoned for one year for having an abortion. Married at the age of 15 and widowed at 32, Lok Maya had been left with five children (two sons and three daughters), the youngest of who was 6 years old. During her imprisonment, her children were sent to live with their uncle. The alleged father of the pregnancy, Bhim Prasad Poudel was also arrested, but he denied responsibility for the pregnancy and the abortion- he was the one who brought Lok Maya to a quack for the abortion - but he was found not guilty. \n \n These case studies raise a lot of issues concerning women's positionality within society and the law. In the first case the woman could not tell the police that she was raped as a lot of stigma is attached to the victim. She would have been ostrasized by the society through no fault of her own. In the second case, the woman had to play with her life because of the fear that another child would be a girl, an unwanted baby. In the third case the woman had to go the jail and the person who was responsible for her abortion was set free. \n \n The Human Cost of Illegal Abortions. \n '\"When an aeroplane crash kills 500 people it makes international headlines for days. The number of women world-wide who die from illegal abortions amounts to one to two such airline crashes very single day and this makes no news anywhere,\" David Grieves Med told the 1996 National Abortion Federations conferences (Goodwill, 1996: 15). In Nepal maternal death is one of the highest in the world 1500/100000: half of these are caused by illegally induced, back-street abortions. \n \n But women's lives are not the only cost of unsafe abortions. \"Between 10 and 50% of all women who undergo unsafe abortions need medical care for complications. The most frequent complications are: incomplete abortions, sepsis, haemorrhage and abdominal injuries, such as puncturing or tearing of the uterus. Long-term health problems caused by unsafe abortion include: chronic pelvic pain, pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal blockage and secondary infertility. Other possible consequences of unsafe abortion are ectopic pregnancy and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion or premature delivery in subsequent pregnancies. Such problems can limit women's productivity inside and outside the home, constrain their ability to care for children and adversely affect their sexual and reproductive lives.\" (WHO, Internet 1998 23 )\n \n It should also be remembered that there is a tremendous impact on the public health system by illegal abortions and the resulting abortion related complications. The treatment of such complications often requires several days of hospitalisation, staff time, as well as blood transfusions, antibiotics, pain control medicines and other drugs. The provision of this care depletes funds and medical supplies needed for other types of treatment. As much as 50% of hospital budgets in some developing countries are used to treat complications of unsafe abortion.\" ( WHO internet, 1998 ) \n \n (More)",

   "The Nepali Movement to Legalize Abortion\n One prominent lawyer describes the situation as follows: \"I know that in Solukhumbu District (in eastern Nepal) five out of nine women in prison have been prosecuted for/ are serving sentences related to infanticide. One specific problem related to women in prison charged with infanticide is that there is no medical investigation system in Nepal to determine if a woman was really pregnant or not, whether she had a normal delivery, abortion or forced delivery. For this reason, many women are in prison. Secondly, men are in the most cases outside judicial action. \n \n Feminists and activists in Nepal are working toward legalising abortion from the perspective of health and justice for women who are forcibly jailed for abortion. A bill has been drafted and put through parliament. The women's movements are trying to raise this issue in connection with Beijing Conference which was signed by our government. The Fourth World Conference on women recommended that countries \"consider reviewing laws containing punitive measures against women who have undergone illegal abortion.\" (As cited in .Packer C 1996 ) .The bill's recommendations include legalising abortions carried out by registered physicians in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and thereafter in special cases like rape, incest, life-threatening situations and where the foetus is diagnosed as being severely handicapped (The Silent Pandemic, 1996: page 3). \n \n The proposal for reforms is based on three realities. First, it responds \"to the limits of public tolerance and public opinions in Nepal. Second, it responds to the increased awareness of women's rights and the growing concern about the victimisation of women in abortion matters. Third, it accepts modern evidence that legal abortion is significantly safer than its frequent social alternative. The bill contains these major characteristics: Abortion at an early stage of pregnancy will be legalised. Medical doctors will perform the operation. Services will be more assessable to women early, thereby reducing the duration of pregnancy at the time of abortion. Proper information will be given to women\". (Real lives, 1997: 10).\n \n Despite the fact that suggests many reforms, much work is still needed. The proposed bill does not look at abortion as a 'reproductive right' issue and does not consider male responsibility. There has been a great deal of discussion regarding this bill, and in February 1997, another bill was introduced which addressed a number of issues relating to women's rights including property inheritance, rape and a proposed amendment to the abortion law. Unfortunately, the parliament was dissolved in 1996 as result of a political crisis, before legislative action was taken on this bill and only now is the bill under discussion again. 'According to a survey done by Family Planning Association of Nepal, 74% of members of parliament are in favour of legalising abortion, as are 94% of gynaecologists'. (Kathmandu Post, 1998 ; 8). \n \n The idea of legalizing is not without obstacles.There are some Hindu religious groups that want to continue to make it illegal. Though they are not a very strong force, they have had an impact. At the same time some members of Parliament are not keen to raise the issue of abortion as they do not think that it is an issue which should be dealt in the discussion. Nevertheless, women's voices, which equate legalizing abortion with women's political empowerment, have already made some changes. \n \n Nepal Medical Association of Nepal has forwarded a program in which it has clearly suggested to the doctors conditions under which abortion can be performed in hospitals. Though in the lawbooks it is illegal to perform an abortion, in some parts of our country doctors in hospitals do perform abortion if mothers health is in risk, or the fetus is severely damaged. It is an open secret that the government is aware of. But it is not done in every hospital and not on the request of the mother. \n \n (More)",

   "After legalization \n We cannot hope that the legalization of abortion in Nepal will automatically guarantee access to safe abortion for all segments of the population. In a developing country like Nepal, merely the fact that abortion law is liberal does not and cannot gurantee that women have access to legal abortion facilities. There are too many constraints, including the lack of human resources such as doctors and nurses in many parts of Nepal, lack of confidence of women and financial obstacles. Activists and medical professionals should be aware that \"legalising abortion is thus only the first step in making safe abortion a real option.\" (Hartmann B. 1987; 63). \n \n In countries like India, where abortion is legal, incidence of illegal abortion is still very high. \"In India at least 10 times as many illegal abortions are carried out as legal ones and ar least 80 per cent of women admitted ot hospitals with complications have had abortions performed by unqualified people\"( Gupta j. ,1996 ;216) . So we have to work to make sure that people have equal access to safe abortions. \"properly performed, abortion is a woman's safety net and one of the most important reproductive rights of all\".(12) \n \n The government will have more responsibility to ensure that abortion is available to all who need it after it is legal. In order to reduce the current heavy toll of abortion-related maternal death and morbidity, governments, international agencies, women's groups and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) must take steps: ensure universal access to family planning; increase the availability of safe abortion services to the extent allowed by law; improve the quality and accessibility of post-abortion care; educate their communities about reproductive health and unsafe abortion; and work for changes in policies to safeguard women's reproductive health. A high priority should be given to the prevention of unwanted pregnancy through comprehensive client-oriented reproductive health services. \n \n Non-judgmental attitudes, confidential counselling and quality family planning information and services should be universally accessible to all women, including emergency contraception where feasible and appropriate. Quality Services should be safe and available to the full extent allowed by law, particularly in rural and impoverished areas. Service providers must be carefully trained to offer high quality services and compassionate counselling. The providers must be well informed about the legal status of abortion and protocols for providing services so that eligible women can access them quickly and without unnecessary delay or bureaucratic procedures. The available services should be publicised within the community and links should be strengthened with women's groups, health centres and related organisations thus ensuring that women who need services are informed about where and when to seek care.\n \n Conclusion \n As things stand, discrimination of women from equal access to health care leads to illegal and unsafe abortions. Criminalization is associated with the lower status of women and with women's subordinate position in the family and in society. Hence it is very important that abortion rights should go together with women's access to and control over social resources. At the local level and national level, policies and programmes must ensure that women enjoy a harmonious and disease free sexual life. Representatives from different political parties should regard women's issues as a part of the main stream agenda, not as an issue that can be sidelined. There should be programs to disengage and influence policies that enable women to manage their own fertility safely and effectively, and by choice, not through coercion. \n \n I would emphasize that abortion not be used as a method of family planning. We should make accessible better and safe contraceptive services for all people to reduce the need for abortion. To ensure complete reproductive health, policies and programmes must be framed within and implemented as part of broader women's development strategies that will redress the equal distribution of economic resources among and between men and women. \n \n (Dr. Aruna Uprety works as a medical pratitioner in Kathmandu, Nepal.)",

   "http://www.alternet.org/rights/21049\n \n When There Was No Choice\n By Sharon Lerner, Village Voice. Posted January 20, 2005.\n At 77, Dr. Harry S. Jonas can still pinpoint the exact moment when he understood the importance of making abortion legal. The year was 1952 and he was an eager, young obstetrics-gynecology intern in Independence, Miss.. The specialty promised exciting pregnancies and bouncing babies, but his very first patient entered the hospital extremely sick. A mother of 12 children, she had tried-unsuccessfully-to induce an abortion. \"She came into the hospital with her intestines hanging out her vagina,\" recalls Jonas. \"Then she died.\" \n \n For Mildred Hanson, the belief that abortion laws had to change came more gradually, even after she first learned about the danger of illegal abortions as a girl in rural Wisconsin. In 1935, when Hanson was 11, a woman on a neighboring farm died at home after having an illegal abortion. Hanson remembers her mother going next door to help the ailing woman, holding her while she died. The widower was left with six children, two of them in diapers. \n \n By the time she finished her medical training in 1959, Hanson was seeing many patients with complications from illegal abortions. Some had gone to illegal practitioners. Others attempted the procedure themselves using rubber tubes, knitting needles, or potassium permanganate-a corrosive substance that could end a pregnancy but all too often only caused bleeding, ulcers and burns. And of course there were the wire hangers. Hanson eventually developed a reputation for being among a minority who would treat these women. She tended to their infections, bleedings, and wounds for almost two decades. And by the time abortions became legal, Hanson knew she would perform them. \n \n Eugene Glick's first experience with illegal abortion was personal. His wife, who was then his girlfriend, was 19 when she got pregnant in 1951. Neither was ready to have a baby-she wanted to finish college and he was planning on going to medical school. They thought they were lucky to find an OB-GYN willing to perform the procedure illegally, but \"he didn't even sterilize the instruments,\" as Glick remembers. Glick's wife got a serious infection and wound up needing major surgery. \n \n When he got to medical school, Glick noticed his teachers willfully ignored the consequences of illegal abortions. \"They didn't want it to even appear that they knew what to do,\" he remembers. But Glick couldn't overlook the desperation-and began finding ways to perform abortions even before they were legal. His hospital had an abortion committee, which would approve the procedure if a doctor determined that a pregnancy threatened a woman's physical or mental health. \"We all knew which psychiatrist to send them to,\" says Glick. \"All of us sort of bent the rules.\" Eventually, in 1977, after delivering 5,000 babies as an obstetrician, Glick started performing abortions full-time. \n \n If their paths toward providing abortions were different, Hanson, Glick and Jonas have a few things in common. Like many other doctors committed to choice, they witnessed the devastating consequences of illegal abortions firsthand. This week, the 32nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision establishing the constitutional right to end a pregnancy, will occur just two days after our anti-abortion president celebrates his inauguration. With several Supreme Court appointments potentially at stake, it's worth remembering what those pioneering physicians learned through treating thousands of women who'd had unsafe abortions: Outlawing the procedure doesn't make it go away. \n \n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n \n Abortions were common well before New York decriminalized them in 1970 and Roe made them legal in the rest of the country in 1973. The Alan Guttmacher Institute, which does research on reproductive issues, reports that in 1930 almost 2,700 women died from illegal abortions-and that's just the number who had abortion recorded as their official cause of death. Almost one in 10 low-income women in New York City reported having attempted to end a pregnancy with an illegal abortion, according to one study done in the 1960s. In 1962 alone, almost 1,600 women were treated for incomplete illegal abortions in at Harlem Hospital. And there's plenty of current evidence showing the danger of outlawing the procedure. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 80,000 women around the world still die each year of complications from illegal abortion. \n \n Roe v. Wade quickly cleared up this country's illegal-abortion mess, almost overnight. Deaths from botched abortions slowed dramatically. The number of women admitted for unexplained miscarriages dropped precipitously. And doctors could finally spare their patients the dangers of untrained, illegal practitioners or self-inflicted injuries without risking jail time or their medical licenses. \n \n (More)",

   "Yet some physicians, especially younger ones, don't seem to grasp the grim situation women faced before 1973. \"Doctors who weren't practicing before Roe don't fully understand about the kind of degradation and death that really resulted from illegal abortion,\" says Wendy Chavkin, chair of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health, and a professor of OB-GYN and public health at Columbia University. \"As a result, they're more likely to be vulnerable to the attacks on abortion and decide that performing them is too much trouble. What they don't know is that, without legal abortions, their patients will suffer, die, or have drastically reduced life options.\" \n \n The fading of collective memory helps explain why the number of doctors willing to perform the procedure is falling. There were only 1,819 abortion providers in 2000, down 11 percent from the 2,042 abortion providers in 1996, according to the Guttmacher Institute. And these days, as legal restrictions on abortion mount, most doctors who do abortions are over 65. Rather than performing the procedures in their offices or in hospitals, they've been forced to do them in freestanding clinics, where they and their patients are exposed to violence and harassment. \n \n Hanson, who lived through darker times, has noticed the shift. \"To perform an abortion in a hospital is harder today than it was before Roe,\" says Hanson. \n \n \"Before 1973, I had no trouble scheduling them. You just had to find two doctors to sign the form,\" she says, referring to the paperwork declaring that a pregnancy threatened a woman's mental health. \"Now if you want to do an abortion in a Minnesota hospital, you have trouble finding an anesthetist and a circulating nurse who will do it. There's more anti-abortion sentiment.\" Nevertheless, Hanson still performs abortions at 81 because of \"personal commitment,\" as she puts it. \n \n In New York, William Rashbaum, a 78-year-old obstetrician and gynecologist, also continues to work well past what many think of as retirement age. As with other veteran abortion doctors, Rashbaum's career has spanned many eras. He saw \"gobs and gobs\" of women with complications from illegal abortions during his training in New York City in the 1950s. Then Rashbaum went on to provide medical advice and backup to illegal abortionists before Roe. (One, in New Jersey, sent a limousine containing a pale, bleeding patient and the piece of her intestine he had accidentally cut off to Rashbaum's office.) And after abortions became legal, he provided them. Now as his practice winds down, Rashbaum worries that the right to safe, legal abortion is slipping away. \"You'd be crazy not to worry,\" says the white-haired physician. \"Abortion has always had a stigma. And now, instead of things getting better, they're getting worse.\" \n \n Sharon Lerner is a senior fellow at the Center for New York City Affairs at Milano Graduate School, New School University",

Your second source, factcheck.org, completely disproves everything that you just said. The use of antiseptics wasn't popularly used by doctors until after WW2. The decline started in the 1940s, the same time when hospitals were given the right to self-determine whether a woman needed an abortion or not.

Check out the graphic!\n \n http://www.catholic.net/rcc/loveboth/2chart27.jpg\n \n Let me sum this up for you since you probably didn't read this site either. In the year 1993, Poland had a referendum on abortion and the people decided not to make abortion legal any longer. So they criminalized it and by 1994 it is the first year that it came into effect. Now check out the birthrate below...notice how there were even less people born instead of more? You see, women always find ways to end their pregnancies. The women in Poland, being completely surrounded in countries that permit abortion, simply went on vacation to have an abortion. \n But let me get to the point. Legalizing abortion in the United States didn't stop back-alley abortions totally. Even today, in the year 2006, many women continue to perform their abortions that same way did back in the 1920s; self-inflicted, using house hold objects. Legalizing abortion means nothing if the populace cannot afford them or have access. And the truth of the matter is that abortion is a costly procedure and the women who need abortions are often the poorest, unfortunately. To poor to have a child, too poor to have an abortion. So it wasn't that 200,000 some abortions were decreased, it was that 200,000 abortions weren't performed within the confines of a doctor. \n \n \n \n Where is your rocket-science skills on that one? Aside from the actual numbers not being known, the experts still state that it probably wasn't as high as many abortions activists claim.\n http://www.forerunner.com/forerunner...thout_Roe.html\n\n \n Did you even READ the first sentence of that? It states....\n \n [qoute] \"Laws preventing abortion will not only dramatically reduce the total number of abortions...\" [/quote]\n \n Which is what I am saying! Considering, the source you used is a study done by the opponents of abortion rights. \n \n \n The report, Life Without Roe: Making Predictions About Illegal Abortions, was released Wednesday, July 1, by the Storer Foundation, an educational foundation dedicated to examining issues related to life and death and affiliated with the National Right to Life Committee. \n\n \n Wow! Can you imagine that? A study affiliated by the NRLC also just happens to support their platform position concerning the number of illegal abortions. What a favorable coincidence! It doesn't even tell you how it was done. However every statistic concerning the number of illegal abortions being performed within the millions to hundreds of thousands come from people not affiliated within either movement.

I think you just had a knee-jerk reaction and now your disappointed to find out that Planned Parenthood isn't being deceitful. You made a mistake...can't you just admit that? Do you desperately despise them SO much you are going to knit pick over this??\n \n \n \n \n \"...a time frame was established in the first sentence and the second sentence is just an extension on the first. If I said \"every year millions of people get the flu. Thousands die.\" \n\n \n The fact that you cannot even understand what Planned Parenthood said by using a very inaccurate example vastly proves you made a mistake and did not understand the context of what was said. \n If you did say \"every year millions of people get the flu. Thousands die.\" then I would think you are talking about a current date since die isn't pass tense. When Planned Parenthood said \"In the two decades before abortion was legal in the U.S., it's been estimated that nearly a million women per year sought out illegal abortions. Thousands died. Tens of thousands were mutilated.\" then it is apparently referring to past tense...check the suffix at the end of the words \"die\" and \"mutilate.\" The \"ed\" implies this isn't annual but something that has taken over some length of time. \n It is very apparent that whoever wrote it knew they weren't applying such figures on an annual basis. If they were wouldn't they have saved themselves a few words and said, \"In the two decades before abortion was legal in the U.S., it's been estimated that nearly a million women sought out illegal abortions, thousands died and tens of thousands mutilated per year.\" However the figures are completely isolated into different sentences. \n \n \n \n \"Would you think this mean't thousands have died from the very first day the flu existed? Get real.\"\n\n \n Unless Planned Parenthood directly said it how can you say it is misleading or even a lie? \n \n \n \n \"Did I say only penicillin? Check over medical advances during that time big shot.\"\n\n \n So...umm...Sulfa was the medical wonder you are talking about? It was introduced at 1941. Between 1940 to 1941, the mortality rate was ALREAY decreasing! Therapeutic abortion was introduced by 1939...why do you still struggle with this? Connect the dots! \n \n \n \n \"You dont say what is right after that...\" It is impossible to know if his figures are accurate, given that no reliable records exist on the total number of illegal abortions that occurred, much less the number of deaths.\" \n\n \n This is speculative, not objective since the author fails to provide any substance to their claim. Anyone can say they feel something isn't accurate. This isn't a proper nor logical rebuttal to a fact. \n Yes, I read over everything...I am not selective and I expected you to attempt such a rebuttal. \n \n \n \n \"You are the only one defending them now...\"\n\n \n Defending who?\n \n \n \n \"...the funny part it, planned parenthood had the stats as reasons why abortion should be legal (or is legal). But wait! As we established the number of people that died from abortions went down to under a thousand so this reason is still not accurate and is still misleading. Anymore ideas?\"\n\n \n It isn't accurate, again you are at a loss of historical insight. Abortion was semi-legal by the early 1940s through therapeutic abortion. Thus it is improper to use the figures of those who died from criminal abortions between 1940 to 1973 as a mean to prove thousands didn't die; you are producing fraudulent results. If Planned Parenthood had made the claim that thousands (plural, not singular) were dying annually during the apex of pro-life ideology (1850 to 1930) then they would be right on; abortion was strictly banned within those years. I see nothing inaccurate about such a claim but to suggest such a scenario might happen again is impossible to predict since it would depend on the logistics and mechanics of criminal abortion. \n \n \n \n \"Or it could be the realistic reason that it is impossible to know how many illegal abortions happened.\"\n\n \n It is unrealistic, in America, to know how many legal abortions have happened as well but this doesn't prove that abortions don't happen. In fact, no one knows how many legal nor criminal abortions are done within the world.\n However following trends in abortion, fertility and childbirth shows us that legal abortion did not alter the number of pregnancies carried to term. You accept one of the scenarios to explain this situation.\n \n I) More women become pregnant, who would not have wanted to be pregnant before Roe v Wade.\n \n Ii) More women had legal abortions, who would have ordinarily aborted their pregnancies through illicit means before Roe v Wade.\n \n Only one of these explanations has facts, trends and historical accounts to support it. The other, from all the research that I have done, has none. \n \n \n \n \"So you use the site to try and make a point and then call the site biased....How confusing.\"\n\n \n You appear to be confused by a lot of things so I am not surprised. I acknowledge that the website you used supports the common pro-choice belief that laws against abortion do not decrease it's popularity; it was in the introductory sentence! I am bringing this to your attention...not using it as supportive evidence in my beliefs. \n Yes, you are very confused. \n \n \n \n \"You then go on to talk about a how making abortion illegal will not reduce abortions (a point I don't really care about) but unrelated to this topic...so if you want to talk about that, start another thread.\"\n\n \n You were the one who brought it up. \n \n \n \n \"So do you still wish to defend Planned Parenthoods fake numbers?\" \n\n \n I am not here to defend neither...just the truth. It appears it is only you who has gone out on such a tantrum of reprisal. It must burn you that abortion is legal and Planned Parenthood is the largest provider of abortions here in America.",

Their face came from this \"The figure comes from a 1936 study by Dr. Frederick Taussig who estimated that abortion claimed the lives of 5,000 to 10,000 women a year\"...But just to make you happy, I am going to ask Planned Parenthood about it (in an email).\n \n \nSo...umm...Sulfa was the medical wonder you are talking about?

Connect the dots!\n It started to decrease as pencillin and other drugs became more and more available...it wasn't widly available but it was available in 1940. What was your reason for the rapid decrease in illegal abortions again?(which is still a very sketchy fact at best)/ \n \n \nYou were the one who brought it up. \n\n \n I don't recall bringing up anything about abortion being illegal will decrease abortions.",

   "...it's been estimated that nearly a million women per year sought out illegal abortions. Thousands died. Tens of thousands were mutilated. All were forced to behave as if they were criminals.\n\n \n I can see why one might think this means \"thousands died\" as an overall number and not annual. However, even if they did mean this I believe it is misleading because it can be easily seen as \"thousands died\" a year. As I said though, I emailed planned parenthood to clarify what they meant.\n \n EDIT: It seems that Planned Parenthood doesn't have the staff to answer my question...however the did give me a website of an updated \"stand\" which you can find at plannedpartenthood.com. It said that 17% of maternal deaths were due to abortion prior to 1973 (an each year fact). I have nothing more to say on what planned parenthood said but I wish they would take it down and add their \"updated\" fact so no one is misled or confused.\n \n there is also a site...www.teenwire.com that claims legal abortion has saved many lives....I would have to say this is a half-truth as making abortion illegal has saved many lives too. The misleading continues...\n \nPeople who are anti-choice oppose abortion and often call themselves pro-life. Many people who are anti-choice do not believe that women should be able to choose abortion under any circumstances, even if she has been raped or if carrying the pregnancy to term may put her life in danger. They also disagree with most medical authorities about the definition of pregnancy. They mistakenly believe that pregnancy begins with the fertilization of the egg. Most authorities believe that pregnancy begins when the implantation of the fertilized egg into the lining of the uterus is complete.\n\n \n lol, they call us \"anti-choice\" and that we believe that abortion should be restricted under ALL circumstances..even the life of the mother? Who comes up with this stuff. This was written to help a girl for a SCHOOL PROJECT. Wow, what a load of BS Planned Parenthood is.",
