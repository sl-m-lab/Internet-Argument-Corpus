You don't kill or chop off innocent people's hands in war. \n\n \n I don't think saudi justice is questionable at all. There is no question that they routinely grab \"suspects\" off the street in order to appear that they are doing something. Innocent, guilty, who cares? why would it matter when you ar just going to end up executing the guy anyway (or have him killed in prison)? If you torture somebody long enough, they will admit \"their\" crimes just to get you to stop. It is amazing how many of the \"criminals\" who are captured and disapear in saudi (and saudi makes Iraq under saddam look friendly) are, coincidentally, political enemies of the house of Saud. Just this year a prominent journalist was arrested and ended up being killed in prison. his \"crime\"? He allegedly stole a trinket from a vendor. No vendor ever came forward and admitted to filing a complaint.\n \n Take a look at some of the human rights reports on saudi arabia. \n \n \n \n \nPerhaps, but we strive to punish the correct person, not simply grab a guy of the street, beat him to give a false confession and then kill him to appease the masses.\n\n \n Our way may seem fairer, but their way is certainly more efficient. Their way doesn't make any less sense than the folks here in the US who want to be \"hard on crime\" by locking people up for extraordinary periods of time for relatively benign offenses then ruin the rest of their lives over small infractions. \n \n the Sauds have figured it out. The public wants revenge, and it really doesn't matter if you have the right guy or not, as long as they get to actually see the blood.",

The fact that America has found it useful to keep a tyrannical government in power in Saudi Arabia does not make it right, and I will always support those \"terrorists\" who attack that tyrannical government in the name of self rule and democracy.\n \n \n \n From a realistic standpoint, the Soviet union self destructed due to their massive security expendetures. too bad we didn't manage to learn anything from that.\n \n \n \n Do you smoke crack daily, or is it just a weekend thing?  the dollar is a joke, our deficit is climbing with no end in sight, the long term picture for the stock market is REALLY ugly, the baby boomers are starting to retire (wihtout enough money left in the entire country to meet the social security obligation to them) and we are loosing a trillion dollars a year due to our trade deficit. I don't expect Kerry would be able to do anything to fix this mess, but bush hasn't done anything to fix it either, so lets not try to make the man into the savior of our economy. We are still seeing a job deficit, and the jobs that ARE being created pay 40% less than those that have been lost (manufacturing jobs mostly).\n\n \n Neither am I.\n \n I don't smoke crack at all.\n \n You can blame a lot of our economic woes on terrorism, such as you support.

   "I realize you can find evidence that some Saudis have financed and participated in terrorism, the prime example being Bin Laden. You can find evidence that some Americans have done the same.\nFirst I want to mention briefly that bin Laden is not a Saudi citizen. The kingdom stripped him of his citizenship more than 10 years ago and declared him persona non grata after he tried to overthrow the ruling regime.\n \n As for the parallel you've drawn between American terrorists and Saudi terrorists, it doesn't stand up to scrutiny. No doubt we have terrorists within our borders, but our government brooks no nonsense from home-grown American terrorists, whereas the Saudi royal house has powerful factions that finance and protect terrorist groups.\n \n Surely there are Saudis favorably disposed to the West and who might fairly be considered American allies, but the prevailing view of most Saudis is anti-American, as confirmed in their media and in their schools and mosques. When we ask if the Saudis are friend or foe, our focus should be on the House of Saud, since most Saudis on the street are already antagonistic to the U.S.\n \n Despite rough patches in U.S.-Saudi relations since 9/11, it's no surprise that some in Washington continue to characterize the Saudis as our friends. We have no practical alternative. If the monarchy falls, its replacement is certain to be more hostile to U.S. interests, so we're nearly compelled to remain in bed with a brutal totalitarian regime and hope that the rivalries and intrigues gripping the royal house eventually pan out in our favor. None of this would even matter if the kingdom were not sitting on an ocean of oil, but that's reason enough for the U.S. to want to maintain our long-standing bilateral friendly relations.\n \n Still, there are of major concerns one can point to that underscore the dangers that Saudi policy poses to U.S. security. The most significant perhaps is Saudi Arabia's state religious doctrine, the Wahhabite version of Islamic law. It's the same ideology that drives the fundamentalist militancy of al Qaeda. Indeed, militant Islam thrives in Saudi Arabia, and despite proclamations by the Saudis of being U.S. allies in the war on terror, the country remains a principal supporter of al Qaeda as well as Palestinian terror groups.\n \n Furthermore, the Saudi princes use petro dollars as a way to control religious leaders and keep them at bay, by redirecting their anger outward, against the West. Wahhabism calls for the destruction of the U.S. and rejection of Western values, replacing them with totalitarian Islamist regimes like the one they created in Afghanistan under the Taliban. The Saudis continue to actively support literally thousands of mosques and madrassas around the world, from Pakistan and Indonesia to Western Europe and the U.S.\n \n Now some of the terrorism the Saudis sowed abroad is coming home to roost. The attacks this year within the kingdom are likely related to the raging struggle within the royal house for succession to the throne. The king's illness has left him incapacitated for nearly a decade, leaving the kingdom without the solid authority of a reigning monarch. As a result, the de facto ruler, Crown Prince Abdullah, is unable to innovate reforms or effectively fight terror.\n \n Abdullah's opposition includes defense minister Sultan, interior minister Nayef, and Riyadh governor Salman, among others. Abdullah's declared war on al Qaeda is genuine, but Nayef, as interior minister, is the one responsible for conducting the anti-terror campaign. However, Nayef is still playing a double game, as evidenced by the collusion between the terrorists and Saudi security forces in the attack on the Khobar Petroleum Complex. The attack was designed to scare foreign workers out of the country and sabotage the U.S.-Saudi oil deal to increase production and curb rocketing prices. Al Qaeda's ability to penetrate the well-fortified complex was faciliated by Nayef's ambivalence in confronting the religious extremists.\n \n One can argue the Saudis are our friends, but it's easier to argue just the opposite. The recent half-hearted, self-serving Saudi attempts to cooperate with the U.S. may be too little too late. The longer the royal feuds continue, the less chance there is of stamping out Saudi terror. It's even possible that Abdullah and Nayef will never reach an accommodation, in which case the fall of the House of Saud may come sooner instead of later.",

   "Again Gator, another excellent post. IMO few Americans are aware of or even interested in Saudi Arabia's ideological composition due to the fact that our dependency on oil has necessitated a blanket statement by our government of 'Ally'. Those who question that country's loyalty to the US are thrown in the unpatriotic pile. It discomforts me to understand that so many of those citizens who support our Iraq Policy, from WMDs to Constitutional protection to deposing Saddam to implementing democracy to whatever the current rationalization happens to be blindly support a US government definition of the Sauds as wearing a big white hat with John Wayne type US loyalty, but that's the easily manipulated public.
