   "Not that anyone here cares to read the Creationist slant on soft tissue found in dinosaurs...but here it is....notice how they, as well, are calling for carbon 14 dating on them:\n \n http://creationsafaris.com/crev200503.htm\n \n This appears to falsify, in one dramatic swoop, the claim that dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago. Why don't the scientists admit it? It's uncanny how all the reports treat the 70 million figure like an unquestionable fact, despite the clear implications of this discovery. Notice how the BBC treats the date like dogma: \n \n In the hotly contested field of dino research, the work will be greeted with acclaim and disbelief in equal measure.\n What seems certain is that some fairly remarkable conditions must [sic] have existed at the Montana site where the T. rex died, 68 million years ago. \n \n Seems certain to whom? Not to people with their heads screwed on, who have refused to take the oath of loyalty to the Darwin Party, or signed on to the Committee to Protect the Geologic Column at All Costs. We'll have to see if the NCSE censors this paper, preventing teachers from showing it to their students, to protect their sensitive minds from anxiety when they compare it with their textbooks.\n \n Making the excuse that the process of fossilization is not well understood is pitiful, and imagining these Montana sediments escaping millions of years of mountain uplift, erosion and climate change is a big stretch. Though airtight amber sometimes preserves all the details of an insect, it is incredibly improbable that soft, pliable tissues from a large dinosaur could be preserved in a sedimentary matrix for 10,000 years, let alone 70 million. Somebody ought to press the point. The BBC explains why: \"Normally when an animal dies, worms and bugs will quickly eat up anything that is soft. Then, as the remaining bone material gets buried deeper and deeper in the mud, it gets heated, crushed and replaced by minerals, turning it to stone.\" Schweitzer said in the NG coverage that \"our theories of how fossils are preserved don't allow for this [soft-tissue preservation].\" The pathetic response of some scientists, upon hearing this announcement, is that the soft tissue recovery might help them construct better phylogenetic trees. They seem oblivious to the fact that the data threaten to cut off the long-age limb they are sitting on.\n \n Here is an opportunity for young-earth creationists to make a strong case. It's easier to prove an upper limit than a lower limit: e.g., that under the best of conditions, cells or blood vessels could not be older than a maximum number of years based on lab observations. No reader could claim by observation that they could last millions of years. Thus, the young-age position is more conservative, cautious and empirically based.  Someone should also apply carbon dating to the tissues and see if any C-14 is present. It would be below the detection threshold if the bone is as old as claimed. Watch the efforts to find out if DNA is still present, which \"cannot survive that long\" according to Derek Briggs in the News@Nature article. These are two predictions that can be tested.\n \n This find is making it easier to believe that dinosaurs actually lived in relatively recent times and were buried quickly by a watery catastrophe just as a Biblical chronology indicates. Dramatic as this announcement is, it is not the first. Creationists have followed up on soft-tissue claims for years. In 1994, Buddy Davis and a team endured danger and hardship recovering hadrosaur bones in Alaska that contained unfossilized tissue; their story is published in The Great Alaskan Dinosaur Adventure. Then there was the announcement in all the papers 10/15/2002 about mummified dinosaur remains. Even more remarkable was the BBC News story about mummified soft parts found in a crustacean claimed to be 511 million years old - over seven times older than the dinosaurs on the evolutionary scale (see 07/20/2001 entry). That such announcements are rare in the secular literature does not mean that the fossils are rare; Jack Horner said in the NG article that other dinosaurs are \"probably similarly preserved,\" but workers in the field are usually reluctant to damage dinosaur bones to look inside (maybe partly because they don't expect to find soft tissue after millions of years). What this story illustrates is how scientists tend to find what they expect to find, look for what they need to find, and ask the questions prompted by their worldview. It's instructive to notice who was surprised by today's announcement.",

   "Here's what I want: I want someone to please tell me exactly what evidence is there to suggest that dinosaurs are millions of years old?\nAbsolutely impossible to do in the limited space available on this board. That presumes that I am actually aware of all of the evidence, and I freely admit that I am not. But I can give you a start. First, check out this picture. This is a picture of the K-T boundary that has been exposed in a hillside by erosion. This picture is from Alberta, Canada, but it isn't far from where I grew up and where I studied biology. There are many hills in my home state like this. The K-T boundary is that black layer. It is identifiable around the world and everywhere that it has become visible because of erosion, it can be easily dated by a variety of dating methods. It always dates to 65 million years (one of those methods is not carbon 14). Anywhere a fossil of a dinosaur has been found, it has been in strata below the K-T boundary. There has never been found a single exception (except for birds, that are descended from theropod dinosaurs).\n \nUnfossilized dinosaur bones have been found lying on top of the ground\nThey have not. They may be on top of the ground, having eroded out of the substrate, but they are not unfossilized. Cite the peer reviewed literature to support this foolish claim.\n \n....they've been found with soft tissue lodged in their bones\nThey have not. You have been duped by someone who misrepresented Dr. Schweitzer's work. I don't know if it is because you are dishonest of just a dupe.\n \n...they've been found with their skin still attached\nNope. Skin impressions in the rock.\n \n....their soft, unfossilized eggs have been found with fully-formed embryos inside\nAnother lie, or are you duped again?\n \n....there have been stones etched in ancient history depicting dinosaurs\nDone to get money from dupes like you. They are all modern\n \n....they've been drawn on cave walls and chiseled into walls long before they were dug up or identified.\nThere is no evidence that any dinosaur is depicted in any wall anywhere.\n \nThey've been dated via carbon 14 at 9-15,000 years old.....\nbogus dating done by an inept, dishonest amateur with who wants to prove his already reached opinion.\n \nWhat exactly is the evidence that dinosaurs are old? Answer: more of Mr. Jack SQUAT.\nSo you've got nothing to offer but a whining rant? Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean that the evidence doesn't exist.\n \n By the way, why don't you offer some reliable evidence to support your foolish claims above. Creationist web sites don't do it for me. Peer reviewed literature please.\n \nThe only \"evidence\" science has is their NEED for dinosaurs to be old so that they can continue to fuel their propaganda machine.\nA bit of projection there? Why would science need a propaganda machine? What purpose does that serve?\n \nEvolutionary science has succesffuly hoodwinked the public into believing that dinosaurs are millions of years old, and they know if they admit this is false after all these years of fibbing to people, that the door for Creationism will be swung WIDE-OPEN\nActually it wouldn't. Since there is no rational, believable evidence for creationism, it wouldn't be any more believable if evolution were disproved. As an example, I dare you to start a thread in an appropriate forum and give us tested evidence for a global flood as depicted in Genesis. Good luck.\n \n.....and the scam-artist atheists in science and the media -- knowing how they love controlling poeple's minds -- simply cannot have people thinking this way, so they keep this charade going.\nWhat utter nonsense. How funny that a fundamentalist Muslim should talk about controlling the minds of others.\n \nCheck this site out...read it all -- it's not long....read it nice and slow, it gets better and better the further you go down...notice also what is said about Mary Schweitzer.....Science is just such a huge scam....read all the stuff this guy says about his dinosaur dig experience. This is just un-fffrreaking-believable.\nWhat a crock. Are you actually dumb enough to be duped by that? Dr. Schweitzer was not \"unfairly treated.\" Her work made big news and gained her respect from her peers. She was working with Jack Horner and did her work on some of his specimens.\n \n Creationist sites do not give you the truth, simplesort. You are a dupe.",

Schweitzer was an undergraduate at Utah State University and received her doctorate from Montana State University. Schweitzer describes herself as a \"complete and total Christian\" and has condemned attempts by Young Earth Creationists to hijack her work. Young Earth Creationists believe that the earth is only a few thousand years old while the scientific consensus is that the there is overwhelming evidence that the earth is billions of years old. According to Schweitzer, the Young Earth Creationists \"treat you really bad.\" She said that they \"twist your words and they manipulate your data.\" Schweitzer is currently working with NASA scientists to look for trace evidences of past life on other bodies in the solar system.\nSorry. She has been mistreated.",

He seems unaware of the fact that the reason that Dr. Schweitzer made the statement in which she denied finding blood or bloody tissue was that creationists had already misrepresented the results reported in her paper. She did not report that this is tissue from the original organism. That is still being investigated as far as I know. However, similar results have been obtained from a total of 4 specimens.\n \n What was reported was the presence of flexible bifurcating vessels, similar to blood vessels, elastic tissue-like material that resembles bone matrix, and heme compounds that are concentrated in structures similar to blood cells. No blood was found. Heme is the iron compound in hemoglobin.\n \n It will be interesting if it is determined that the material extracted from the bones actually contains material from the organism or if this is some unknown process that occurs during fossilization. If it is original material, then it will be protein, and from that, something of the DNA can be deduced. Nevertheless, this material would not be an appropriate sample for C-14 dating.

   "You're kidding, right? Scientists have no idea what killed the dinosaurs. The asteroid theory is nothing but a wild guess. There certainly is not a concensous that dinosaurs died this way -- and certainly no proof.\n\n You lie. Scientists have little doubt what killed the dinosaurs. Not only is there an iridium layer at the K-T boundary, but a giant crater off the Yucatan was formed at the same time. Iridium is pretty rare on earth but is abundant in meteoroids. This is not a \"wild guess\"; it is putting two and two together (not that that's the extent of the evidence). I wouldn't be surprised, however, if you saw little difference between wild guesses and kindergarten arithmetic.\n \n \nI can show you dinosaur bones that were laying on top of the ground -- what are you talking about ?\n\n What are you talking about? Do you simply enjoy flaunting your ignorance of geology? Were these fossils (not bones) found in rock younger than the K-T boundary, like obvious_child said they wouldn't be? Of course they weren't. You're full of XXXX.\n \n \nWhy don't you date the bones instead of the sand/soil/rock/dirt that's around the bones?\n\n Which radioactive isotopes with appropriate half-lives exist in the fossils in sufficient quantities to facilitate measurement?\n \n \nBesides, what \"strata\" would the dinosaur be in here:\n\n How could I possibly tell from either that picture or that text, or even both combined? How about you ask someone who knows anything about that particular specimen instead of asking someone for specified knowledge? This is like if I sent you a close-up picture of an interior wall and asked how many walls are between it and outside.\n \n \nAnd what do you think....did they date the sand above, below, and inside the bones of the dinosaur so they can narrow down when the dinosaur lived?\n\n Sedimentary rock isn't tested (nor is loose sediment); any results would be based on the solidification of the igneous matter from which it came, and even that might be inaccurate due to opening of the system. When possible, extrusive igneous layers above and below the fossil are dated to give a maximum range.\n \n \nI mean you do believe in uniformatarianism, right?....just a small, microscopic layer of sediment gets laid down every every thousand years or so?\n\n And you say this right after I explain that your only objections are either (1) reasonable claims that pose problems only for your misunderstanding of science or (2) inane claims period. Uniformitarianism is not the doctrine that a microscopic layer of sediment gets laid down every thousand years or so. The only people who claim it is are the scientifically illiterate who read too many crackpot fundy websites.",

We collected bones on and below the surface. We found both fossilized and unfossilized bones. We dug down about three feet to get to the bones frozen in permafrost. It was the frozen unfossilized bones we were seeking for our research, although we collected some fossilized bones as well. \n \n So what strata is \"ON\" the ground???????\n \n \n And about how the dinosaurs died? Scientists are indeed clueless and divided -- just like I said.\n \n http://filebox.vt.edu/artsci/geology/mclean/Dinosaur_Volcano_Extinction/pages/studentv.html\n \n The cause of the K-T extinctions is one of the great mysteries in science, and scientists have proposed many kinds of theories to account for it. They range from asteroid or comet impacts, volcanism, sea level changes, supernova explosions, and on and on. Beginning in the 1980s, two theories became the topic of intense scientific debate. These are: (1) the K-T impact extinction theory originated by the Nobel physicist, Luis Alvarez, and his team, and (2) the K-T Deccan Traps volcanism-induced carbon cycle perturbation extinction theory originated by the author which, for short, I call the volcano-greenhouse theory. \n \n He doesn't sound as confident as you.\n \n \n Neither do these people....in fact, they're still looking for the for \"the big hit.\"\n \n http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/24072/story.htm\n \n Now they need to find the actual crater left by whatever made this final blow.
