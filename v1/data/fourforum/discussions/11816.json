   "Just because I've seen burden of proof arguments horrendously misused a couple of times, I thought I'd post this. It's not my work, instead it is an excerpt from a rant by a good friend of mine who occasionally goes by the handle 'Tsukatu'. However, it succinctly covers all the points. Worth reading, especially if you've been involved in a 'no, YOU prove it' argument recently.\n \n \nThis is an explanation of something known as the Burden of Proof, basically a fundamental rule of debate.\n Again, this is here primarily for storage purposes, but if you found this and you're interested, feel free to comment or something.\n \n The basic idea is that you don't just do things if you can't find a lack of a reason not to - you need to consider the reasons for doing them first and foremost, and if those are more compelling than inaction, only then do you even begin looking for reasons against.\n \n Here's the process laid out:\n * You assert something. The default position is that your assertion is invalid (false). Mind you, that doesn't mean that the opposite of your assertion is true by default (the opposite is also false by default, until it follows this same process), but only that your assertion cannot be trusted to be correct.\n * You must provide at least one compelling reason that your assertion is valid. If no one is able to challenge your reasoning, and your assertion and reasoning both hold up to practice (if applicable), then your assertion is valid, and it is completely acceptable to believe it.\n * If anyone manages to challenge your reasoning and you're unable to defend it, then that reasoning can't be supported and it is unable to validate your assertion. If your assertion has no more validating reasons, it defaults to false.\n * In the more devastating case, if anyone manages to find an inconsistency within your initial assertion itself, with all supporting reason completely aside, that not only defeats all of the supporting reasoning in its entirety and reduces the assertion to its default of false, but also provides a compelling reason to believe that the opposite of the assertion is true.\n * If someone is able to assert and support something that entails your assertion is false unconditionally, one of you is in error. If it is true and it entails your assertion being true some of the time, your assertion should be ammended to include that, otherwise it is false.\n * If your assertion appears to be consistent and at least one supporting reason is compelling enough to believe it, then it will be accepted as true.\n \n Every scientific idea that has advanced to the level of \"theory\" has gone through this process. Most people consider the word \"theory\" to be synonymous with \"idea\" or \"hypothesis,\" but this is just plain wrong. Having an idea is one thing, but when the scientific community puts forward an effort to falsify that idea and consistently fails, it is only *then* reluctantly promoted to the status of \"theory.\" If you hear a theory and you're not a scientist trying to prove that it's wrong, you'd do damned well to believe it (because in most cases, if not all, it'd be brazen and idiotic not to).\n \n For example:\n I assert that I'm posting this on Facebook.\n The easiest way to provide compelling reasoning in support is demonstration - this note exists, the website exists, and look where this note is.\n If you can defeat that reason, I can probably come up with plenty more. So far as I understand it, though, this reasoning cannot be meaningfully challenged (don't start with the solipsism).\n So far as I understand it, the assertion is also self-consistent. If I had said that this note is also a dog, you'd know that that can't be right because a dog is not an abstract noun, and this post is not a physical thing. I would not be correct no matter how much reasoning I can give in support, because the initial assertion is inconsistent.\n You can't challenge my reasoning on this assertion, nor can you find any inconsistencies in it, and so you must accept that it's very probably true. You can still take the cop-out position and say that you don't understand the assertion and/or the reasoning, and so you must suspend judgment, but that's silly to do in a trivial case like this.\n \n Now let's assume that we live in XXX-Backwards Logic World where assertions have to be proven false before they're discarded, and the default value of things is true (in other words, guilty until proven innocent).\n I say invisible pink unicorns exist. You ask why I think that's true, and I flip you the bird. I ask why you think they don't exist.\n You can't give me a compelling reason as to why an invisible pink unicorn can't exist as long as I keep mounting on properties that make them impossible for humans to observe or be affected by them. You will fail miserably to disprove my invisible pink unicorns, and so you must accept the default that the assertion is true. It would be in your best interests to begin acting as though invisible pink unicorns existed as I described them.\n And I can do this for a theoretically infinite number of things, and you'd be foolish not to believe them all, because they're all logical according to the XXX-Backwards Logic of XXX-Backwards Logic World.\n\n \n In short, please don't say \"I've said X, it's your job to prove me wrong\". It really isn't.",

   "Black swans are an old in-joke.\n \nWhat if I assert that \"black swans do not exist\" because I have never seen one ?\n Now, what if no one in the room has seen one either, then have I proved my assertion?\nNope, because of the old catchphrase: 'absence of evidence is not evidence of absence'. There are plenty of swans in existence which you have not checked, and there are plenty of places you haven't looked where where a black swan might be hiding. \n A more accurate statement would be 'There are no black swans in the places I've looked, at the time I was looking, that I could see'. Which brings us nicely onto the second part...\n \n \nWhat if I look into my garage and say it is true that there is no pink elephant inside because I can't see one? Have I proven it, because my senses can not sense a pink elephant?\nThis is more provable, because the terms 'pink' and 'elephant' describe a creature which could not hide in your garage if you took a look - assumed in your phrase is \"a pink elephant (that is visible and normal size)\". If we treat your statement in the same way as we treated your swan-based one, you can say \"There are no pink elephants in the places I've looked, at the time I was looking, that I could see\". Given that you have looked everywhere within your garage where a pink elephant (that is visible and normal size) could be, you can safely say that there are no pink elephants in your garage (at the time of looking).\n \n However, if you start adding extra features to the elephant that take it away from the standard definitions of 'pink' and 'elephant' - for example, that the elephant is the same size as a subatomic particle - then you run into the same problem as you had with the swans.\n \n Essentially - if it is possible that something exists in a place you haven't looked yet, you cannot say 'this thing does not exist' based on the induction that you haven't found it anywhere else so far. This was the case for swans, it was not the case for elephants without drastically redefining the terms 'pink' or 'elephant'. \n \n NB: It's also worth noting that you cannot say 'because there is no evidence that there are no black swans, black swans must exist'.",

   "I wonder what you'll think of this ex-atheists attempt to prove according to scientific standards that God exists. Does God Exist?\n\n I'm not all that impressed, sorry. A very quick critique:\n \n \"The Beginning\" - three attempts to disprove the assertion 'matter/energy is eternal'.\n Argument 1: The fact that the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating rules out a cyclical universe. This has several issues with it, the most significant of which being that the most simple 'cyclical' pattern in maths does accelerate for a while: a sine wave, which is the basis for a pendulums swing, the orbit of a planet, and many others.\n Argument 2: The fact that, despite the sun having burnt for a very long time, there is still plenty of fuel (hydrogen) left. This is countered simply by stating that there was a vast amount of hydrogen in the first place - pretty much the only atoms about were hydrogen, initially (post-big-bang). If the universe really is cyclical, atoms will be returned to hydrogen come the next Crunch.\n Argument 3: This uses the second law of thermodynamics to say that the universe should have dies of heat death by now. This doesn't work because it misunderstands the word 'disorder'. Gravity - which would be expected to power the Crunch - naturally pulls things together, not spreads them apart. This assumption also misunderstands the nature of the second law - firstly it is less a 'law' than a 'consequence' of statistics, but more importantly, heat is not 'lost', because there is no-where for the heat to be lost too. Thermodynamics simply says that heat will spread out - the 'heat death' occurs when the universe is a uniform temperature of ~3K. However, as with the last argument, a big crunch/bang would set up the problem again.\n \n It's also worth pointing out that a 'cyclical universe' is not a necessary factor for atheism. Moving on, then -\n \n \"The Cause\" - this attempts to prove that the Big Bang has an external cause. This is largely flawed because causality is time-dependent (causes never come after effects), whereas time only came into existence at the instant of the Big Bang (cyclical universe aside). Thus, asking what came 'before' is nonsensical - there was no 'before', so there need be no causality.\n \n It's also worth pointing out that a 'caused universe' is not a necessary factor for atheism. See: string theory. Moving on, then -\n \n \"The Design\" - this attempts to show that the 'cause' is an intelligent one. There isn't really any argument made in this section beyond a vague reference to the anthropic principle, which is hardly an argument for design, as it simply states that it's useless to speculate on how unlikely things are as they are, because they are this way - and (as pointed out by others) if the universe were not as it was, it would be different.\n \n An example: flip a million coins, and marvel at how unlikely the sequence you have created is. However, this is not evidence that God wanted the coins to fall that way, it's just evidence that they have fallen.\n \n Finally, \"The Next Step\". This looks looks it's going to point the 'designer' specifically at the publishers own version of the Christian God - but I don't really have time to go link-following at the moment, and I don't see any argument remaining on the page that there is an 'intelligent designer' in the first place.\n \n Response to Winston coming in a second post.

   "It appears to me that some of this discussion is more about how to prove something rather than on the burden of proof. The phrase itself should give a clue as to its meaning. The burden of proof is on the party that makes the assertion to be proved. Discussing that you haven't proved that black swans don't exist does not relieve you of the burden of proving it should you desire to convince us that they don't.\n \n More clearly put: in court cases:\n \n A party's job of convincing the decisionmaker in a trial that the party's version of the facts is true. In a civil trial, it means that the plaintiff must convince the judge or jury \"by a preponderance of the evidence\" that the plaintiff's version is true -- that is, over 50% of the believable evidence is in the plaintiff's favor. In a criminal case, because a person's liberty is at stake, the government has a harder job, and must convince the judge or jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.\n \n \n in debate:\n \n The party making a claim is the party burdened with proving it. It is not required that the opposition disprove it. When the claimant presents what is thought to be proof, the opposition then can either accept the proof or attempt to discredit the evidence presented as proof.\n \n \n \n Regardless of being court or debate based, the burden of proof simply means that whoever makes the claim is burdened with proving it.\n \n Dissecting the evidence and presenting counter claims is left to the other party. However, the other party's opposing claims (evidence) must also be proved so the burden of proof shifts back and forth until the accepted truth comes out.",

   "Sorry, massively late reply! I could have sworn I'd replied to this...\n \n \nTo say that because we haven't found a 'purpose' we don't need it, it is in my opinion a perfect case of sour grapes.\n\n How so?\n \n It strikes me that I could have worded that better - as most people do 'need' a purpose, whether this be religion, charity, money, family or whatever. Perhaps a better wording would be that we don't need to be given a purpose - we're perfectly capable of finding one for ourselves.\n \n \nPeeling is excellent and knowledgeable about the mechanism of evolution but he has never explained how life started. One can look at the inorganic universe and never question its purpose, but life? It is just an accident? RNA, DNA, the coding, the program etc all explained by quantum mechanics? Where ? show me.\nIt really is all there. The problem is that we haven't yet adequately found the right definition for 'life'. Is something 'alive' if it meets the MRS GREN (or MR NERGS, or however your school taught it) standards? Is it alive if it self-replicates? Or exists independently?\n As to origins - there's lots of work being done on abiogenesis. Hydrocarbons forming on clay (which has a self-replicating structure), amino acids being formed by lightning strikes - we're getting closer to how it might have happened. Until we do, it's another of God's Gaps.\n \n \nI don't believe in religion but also I don't think science, a human pursuit, limited by our intellectual capabilities will close all the gaps ever.\nPerhaps not - but just because gaps exist does not mean that God resides within them. On the other hand, perhaps He does.",

But if there is a reason, our ignorance of it does not abolish it.\n I may ignore that Russia exists but my ignorance of it does not wipe out Russia from the map.\n\n Indeed. But without knowledge of that purpose, on what basis do you believe in it? The burden of proof remains with you.\n \n \nYou can define life anyway you want. I am not falling into the semantic trap.

Is it in the protons, in the electrons, in the &#8216;strings&#8217; where? Show me.\n\n You ask for the impossible - you are asking me to define for you what causes matter to act in a fashion that you will/can not define for me. With that said, you've included some hints at a definition in your post, so I'll deal with them while I'm here.\n \"The 'urge', to organise itself\" - No such 'urge' is present. A snowflake, the Giant's Causeway or a crystal of salt is incredibly self-organised, and appears startlingly beautiful. However, all are formed by purely mechanical methods. Such as it was with life.\n \"where is the intelligence to produce for instance the capacity to device a mechanism of copying itself?\" - Again, 'intelligence' is not a prerequisite for such things. Clay forms self-copying layers. Scientists have synthesised self-replicating molecules. None of these are 'guided' in what they do, they simply occur.\n \n \nThe gaps that God is filling are bigger than the Great Canyon. \nIndeed. But humanity has only been around for the blink of an eye.\n \n I would predict (God's imminent discovery notwithstanding) that He will be squeezed out of His Gaps, over and over again. Each time, there will be people who say \"No, this time it's definitely God\"... until someone shifts the paradigm to the next level of knowledge. There will always be gaps, and there will always be those who create a God to fill them... but the gaps themselves are not evidence of the God. \n \n This is all unless by 'God' you mean 'knowledge/understanding/reality that humanity has yet to comprehend'. Using that definition for God... I am in full agreement with you. I look forwards to finding more out about that God - something possibly more deserving of the title 'Jehova' ('That which is').",

   "According to you, things simply occur, matter organizes itself, reproduces, evolves and eventually becomes sentient, intelligent; and all this simply, just happens. So you still don&#8217;t have an answer and not only that you are not even asking the question.\n &#8220;it simply happens&#8221;, reminds me of &#8220;God makes it so&#8221; or &#8216;that is the way things are&#8217;. \n &#8220;Great answer, Daddy, and the sky is blue because it is blue, right Dad?&#8221;\n \n Of course it is a mechanical process but what causes this process, where in matter can the property to organize itself and later to become alive (whatever your definition of life is) be found ? Is this property found at the chemical level (bonds, valence?) or at the quantum level? Where is this &#8216;it&#8217; that causes inorganic matter to become organic?\n Of course there is no intelligence in matter itself. But to create life or simulate life one needs intelligence so, how come we need intelligence to replicate something that just happens by mechanical means ? \n One needs intelligence to decode the code of life. If someone had invented life I am sure you would say that guy is a genius, wouldn&#8217;t you? In other words the intelligence is inbuilt in the process. You can see how &#8216;clever&#8217; the process is, but of course the process itself is not intelligent.\n \n If one applies your reasoning to a working computer you would say that the machine is not intelligent and that the program, operating system for instance itself is not intelligent. It just happens to be that way that the machine code produces/is the operating system. in this case although the program itself, the computer itself is not intelligent, we know intelligent beings designed and built it.\n \n Because you only see Nature and life in it and you don&#8217;t see God it doesn&#8217;t mean that God does not exist. You don&#8217;t look at a computer and say it organized itself, do you?\n I know, a computer can not become a computer by itself. But what would you say if a computer organized itself organically, just for argument&#8217;s sake in front of your eyes (minus the brand tag of course) would you say &#8220;computers simply occur&#8221; ? Of course not, funny then that you observe the Universe and the wonderful manifestations of life in all its complexity and all you can say is : &#8216;it simply occurs&#8217;. Hmm &#8230;\n You wouldn&#8217;t ask: &#8220;wait a moment, how in hell atoms organized themselves into a computer? I can see atoms bonding into complex structures that produce a computer, I can see it is a mechanical process but what produces this mechanical process? Of course you would, but when it comes to life a &#8220;it simply happens&#8221; is your only reaction\n \n I am not saying that God gets his hands dirty and organizes matter manually, I am not saying that he manually makes blocks of life, so to say. But if God doesn&#8217;t and all there is, is matter and I agree, matter is not intelligent, for of course there are no &#8216;smart&#8217; atoms or &#8216;strings&#8217; or whatever, then:\n here we go again: how came the self replicant organic computer called a living organism to be? If there is no &#8216;urge&#8217; for matter to organize itself, then how come it organized itself into &#8230; you, why didn&#8217;t matter just remained inorganic matter ? If the &#8216;urge&#8217; to organize itself can not be found then how come it organizes itself by mechanical means?\n \n I know, I know &#8230; the questions science have no answers for are either irrelevant (to Science that is) or just one of these days, real time soon someone will find the answers. Right?\n \n PS I have had it with this forum, this is the only thread of any interest for me here, the rest is zzzzzzzzzz.\n I &#8216;discovered&#8217; the blogs at The Economist and for an &#8216;internationalist&#8217; such as I, that is where the action is. Some other &#8220;Winston Smith&#8221; has stolen my &#8216;pen name&#8217; there though, so I had to switch to &#8220;symewinston&#8221;.\n Chao",
