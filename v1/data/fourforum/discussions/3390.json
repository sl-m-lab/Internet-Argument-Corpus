   "Hello zachvac:\n Why do you want to \"save people\"?\n \n So that they don't spend eternity in hell while burning in sulfur. We do not want anyone to suffer such a fate, not even murders, rapists, etc. Besides, we are called by Jesus to go out and make witnesses of the nations.\n \n Didn't you say on another post that god loves us even if we hate him? I don't deny there's a god, but I don't claim there is one either. \n \n Yes, but if we don't want to be with Him, then He grants us our wish and pushes us away from His loving, life giving presence, to a painful place called hell. God_is_real was asking for tips on preaching, not preaching. Besides, I honestly do not see anything wrong with people sharing reasons for the hope that they have in them, do you? If you do, then may I suggest that you just ignore it and move on?\n \n Hello God_is_real!\n The following was posted by zachvac:\n Go back to living with god and quit trying to convert people. This site is for debating, not preaching.\n \n Don't listen to him. You will commonly come across these sort of people who refuse to listen to the Gospel (or Good News), at these people you must move on to someone who will listen openly to the Gospel. You are doing exactly what God told us to do, so keep it up! :) Sometimes your actions speak louder than words. If you live your life by the Book and make every effort to be like our LORD and Saviour, others may see Him in you. Also remember the words of 1 Peter 3:15-16:\n \"But in your hearts set apart Christ as LORD. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behaviour in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.\"\n \n We are called to give reasons for the hope that we have in Christ our LORD, e.g. eternal life, for example. I'm not quite sure how good these tips are, but some advice:\n * Pray that the Holy Spirit will soften the hearts of those to whom you are preaching to. It is the Holy Spirit who works in people's life, not us. We are the instrument that It uses. \n * Pray that the Holy Spirit will give you the right words to say.\n * Talk to your pastor or minister for some tips, any family members who might be able to help you. \n * Read the Bible!!\n * You might consider not talking about God straight away with some people. Become friends, and as your friendship grows, you can start conversations about God and other related issues. \n * Be patient and do not get discouraged by failed attempts, but keep at it and keep asking God for the strength to carry on. \n * Distribute creationary and other material and invite your friends and fellow Christians to Creation Science Seminars, for instance, the following is one of the many feedback mail that Answers in Genesis has recieved:\n \"I've recently had the opportunity to listen to one of Mr. Ham's teachings. \n \n I was so excited by what I heard, I went and purchased a copy of the Answers Book.\n \n That book was so awesome and easily understood, I bought another dozen, gave some to the kids in the Youth Group and continue to give to others.\n \n One individual who I have been witnessing to for over a year read the book and stated he was no longer a evalutionist, but a \"creationist\". I've recently ordered 20 more books and believe this is a new and exciting way to spread the gospel, from Genesis! \n \n God Bless, \n \n Pastor Dave Jagemann\n US \"\n and here is another similar story:\n \"I cant thank you enough for the materials you equip christians and non beleivers with...I was brought up in a christian home..but lost my faith because I never felt like i had seen real answers..I thought christianity was something taken on pure faith...your ministry has opened my eyes, and I cant get enough materials from you fine folks, and those at ICR....The Lord used me to give the creation message to my grandfather, who was a beleiver in evolution for most all of his life..after he saw there were answers, and after much praying that the HOLY SPIRIT would open his heart..he bowed his knee, and at 86 gave his life to the Creator of the universe..I cant read enough, and watch enough videos, on creation science..{my girlfriend thinks maybe i spend to much time}..I tell everyone I know about Gods awesome creation, and point them to you or ICR, because you folks are trustworthy, and thats because the one that guides you is the author of truth \n \n Devin Pellew\n US\"\n There are many other such letters, so feel free to check them out here. You may wish to send an email to Answers in Genesis asking for some help. Also try other Christian sites, such as Tektonics for rebuttals to many commonly used arguments against Christianity and the Authority of the Bible.\n \n Sorry I can't help you much, but ask around for tips - listen up in sermons - and try and show others that God lives in you, for example saying a friendly \"Hello\" or other such comments, (such as \"Isn't this a lovely day that God made?\" - sometimes gets people either discussing it, or thinking about it) can go a long way for other people to see God in you; showing compassion for those who others have rejected - compassion requires that we put our faith into action. I've observed my Grandfather saying such things and starting conversations - he is a retired Salvation Army Officer - he is one amazing Godly man. I hope to aspire to him one day. Above all, pray to God about it.\n \n Hi there montalban!\n Are you saying that people are saved by you talking to them? I thought salvation came from God. \n \n Witnessing to a person is basically trying to bring them closer to, and start a relationship with, God. This then will allow the person to ask forgiveness from God and recieve Salvation. Witnessing using the Bible as our basis is a very effective tool in bringing others to know God and improve their lives. Another word for witnessing is preaching.",

   "Hello zachvac (again;-):\n There's a time and place for preaching about god. A debate forum is not one of them. If you wanted to debate with people whether or not there was a god, that's different\n \n Agreed. But if you debate about whether or not there is a God, you may want to include several things about God, what He did for you and so on. This includes the major message of Jesus Christ which is foundational to the whole Christian doctrine. If the argument, for example, is based around Jesus Christ, and you are arguing for Him, then you are going to be talking about Him and who He is and what He has done - which is preaching in a form.\n \n In another one of your posts you wrote and the I quote:\n You can do that [convince people of your point] if you want, but be prepared (able and willing) for people to disagree with you and explain (give details about something) why they think you're wrong just as you think other people are wrong. \n \n Which, once again, is preaching in a form.

Some, like Orthodox, will go into a non-believing community, work in that community - maybe as a teacher or doctor, or something and try and live an Orthodox life.

We do not want anyone to suffer such a fate, not even murders, rapists, etc. Besides, we are called by Jesus to go out and make witnesses of the nations.\n\n What exactly would be physically burning in literal sulfur?\n Obviouisly, it's not one's body or flesh, that's busy rotting here in the material world.\n \n Are we to be frightened by physical pain when all that feels physical pain is the flesh? Are the flames and brimstone of hell real or just a metaphor?\n \n .",
