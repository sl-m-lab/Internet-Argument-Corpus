While I think the tax cuts on the rich is a bad idea (and for the record I think it is equally as bad to eliminate them and use the money for NEW spending) nothing here is a \"cost\". I should say it is misleading. For example, if you make $40,000 a year and you have $50,000 in debt and a job comes along that will pay you $50,000 but you decline it does that mean you now have $60,000 in debt? No. It only means you could have paid it off faster. Same thing applies here. Expenses only come by you spending something. So when you say tax extensions will add $900 to the deficit what you really mean is that spending programs will add that much which are not offset by revenue. \n \n And let's not forget the idea that unemployment benefit extensions are a terrible idea and maybe worse than tax cut extensions. \n \n A perfect bill would jack up the estate tax and make the babyboomers pay back their destruction of the US followed by eliminating unemployment benefits, and finally a tax increase for those making over $250k. \n \n A quick story about that. I was listening to Sean Hannity the other day (don't judge me it was a long day) and this lady gets on saying she is a \"small\" business owner who makes over $250k with her husband. She went on about how much she works and how hard it is to run a business. She then proceeds to say that she lives in a very expensive neighborhood and increasing taxes makes it harder to afford the current standard of living she has for her family. SHE ACTUALLY SAID THIS!!! I couldn't believe my ears. You really think I'm sympathetic to a rich person not being able to afford their special lawn care service or a new BMW for their sh*thead kids? And Sean obviously agreed with the lady. Sorry but if you are making over $250k a year than you aren't hurting.

I'm saying we should take from them because no one else has it and previous generations screwed us over.\n\n \n I'd be curious how Hannity reacted, because I have a similar story, from a looooong time ago.\n \n During a college summer job back in the early 90's, I was sitting in the work truck with a full-time co-worker listening to Rush Limbaugh. (He wasn't the biggest fan, but listened every once in a while, and I wasn't yet convinced of how purely selfish and morally bankrupt the blowhard is. But I digress.) Anyway, he was railing against this that or the other tax policy, and how it was going to wreck all sorts of ordinary folks' lives. He wanted listeners to call in and tell his audience how Bill Clinton was going to hurt them specifically. And the first call he got was from a guy who just sounded despondent: \"Rush, I'm in my 50's, and if this thing passes, I just don't know how I'm going to retire.\" Sensing that he was getting exactly what he wanted, Rush pushed his caller for more specifics: \"My friend, I understand. How much did you make last year?\" Answer: \"Well, last year, I netted about $240,000 after all my federal and state taxes.\"\n \n Stunned silence from Rush for about two seconds, during which my co-worker and I exploded with an odd mix of laughter and profanity. Anyone who can't retire on an after-tax income of $240 grand has been spending stupidly for years and doesn't deserve to have his concerns taken remotely seriously.\n \n And that's the problem now, rather like I was saying the other day. People are going to have to scale back their own spending, personally -- to make personal sacrifices for the good of the country. Unfortunately, I still don't see many people willing to do that. And it's a particularly annoying (because hypocritical) lapse when it's displayed by Tea Partiers. Sadly, for most Americans, the sacrifice is always for somebody else to make.\n \n (It's not that different, really, than the outrageous burden we've placed on our military personnel and their families to fight these wars. No shared sacrifice.)",

So when you say tax extensions will add $900 to the deficit what you really mean is that spending programs will add that much which are not offset by revenue. \n\n \n Not my projection , I got that from the same report Where I was reading about the Tax extensions. I agree, what they should have said was that the Tax extensions will create a 900 billion dollar short fall in revenues. Since we are already so far in debt and I imagine every revenue dollar is already spoken for 900 billion when they say it sounds like it would help solve our current debt which it won't.\n \n On another note I had a thought today. I'm a Huge Sports fan, Football, Nascar, Baseball among others. As I was watching a game the other day < The Game in Dallas, I started Marveling at the new 1.2 billion dollar stadium where they were playing. There wasn't an Empty seat in the place, and I believe it will hold well over 100,000 fans. Nascar Races average around 200,000 per event, And Ticket Prices are outrageous for most sporting events. Anyway, as I was checking out the crowd, I realized that these are all American Citizens. They were laughing and having a great time , drinking beer, eating all the over priced food... and carrying on as if there is no such thing as an economic crisis in this country. I could go to Football games or Nascar races if I wanted to, but damn why would I spend the amount of money to have a good time when I can watch most events on the tube or keep up with them on the internet. So I guess what I'm saying is No, I don't feel sorry for those people whining about the Bush tax cuts expiring. As Ive said before IMO the Government should do the right thing and let all of the Tax cuts expire. The Middle Class can afford more than they are willing to pay, so the rich should not bare the entire burden of paying for past mistakes.\n \n I also agree with you that extending unemployment is just Dumb. If They want to save money and get this economy back on track a good start would be doing away with unemployment. They'd be better served actually trying to help make sure the unemployed can go back to work .",

I don't think you're adopting a consistent position. At the very least, we can say that the skills in question are needed and desirable, yes? (Which is presumably why the person was granted an interview.)\nI was wondering if someone would ask this...you didn't disappoint. Let's say you have a degree in English. This is an undesirable degree. Now, you have two options with this degree if you have been laid off from work (assuming you want another job) 1) Get another degree 2) wait for a job in that degree. Would you agree? If you choose number 2 than it is more desirable to find someone that is still working, even if part time or in an unrelated field (think Cashier at your local grocery store) than someone who has been sitting at home on unemployment. \n \n But more towards you comment, I'm not implying anything about the desirability of traits in my post to you.

What you can tell is if you are a hard worker or not by looking at your job history (which I admit is on the resume so kinda shoot myself in the foot there). Not only that but you are waiting around for a job to open up in your field. That shows lack of effort to me. \n \n \n So let me recap here since it seems you are confusing a few different things:\n \n One, extending unemployment detracts from people being forced to accept a job in a field that is actually hiring. Two, assuming you are chronically unemployed in a field not desired, an employer would be better off going first with someone who still has a job in that field because they are considered (and more than likely accurately so) to be in the swing of things AND good enough to not get laid off and second going with someone who has a job even if unrelated because it shows a willingness to \"do what it takes\" as I say. Now, keep in mind my second point is obviously not universally true. I don't speak for all employers, however, there have been several articles and interviews on the subject recently and it seems like a fair conclusion. I'd also like to point out that my second point might not necessarily be \"fair\" but it is what it is.\n \n \nThis is not, of course, to claim that the unemployed should be given a preference in hiring -- although it's debatable, being \"in the swing of things\" may be important in some cases, and being out of it for a long time may be relevant.

Given the choice between financial ruin of the country or taxing the upper 5% an additional 3%, I don't think \"i want to keep my BMW\" is a great argument. \n \n \nI didn't hear the show, but the way you described it, that's not what she said. She CAN afford it, she just can't pay for it if the government takes HER money. You understand it's HER money, and not the government's, right? Are you sympathetic to workers who build BMW's, or own lawncare services? \nI don't have much sympathy for either. And if you can't afford an additional 3% than perhaps you got bigger problems in the not to distant feature. This is actually the case of the middle class who literally can't afford a 3% increase. The top 5%, on the other hand, have been sitting on the sidelines with their money. \n \n Does that sound unfair? Yes! But again, given the choice between a bankrupt US or tapping the rich, I choose to tap the rich. Now if you argue that taxing them will just cause congress to increase spending than I'd agree so I'd hope if we did a tax increase it would come with the caveat of not a cent over the budget of 3 years ago.\n \n \nSo ANYONE who makes $250k lights cigars with $100 bills and doesn't have a care in the world?\n Certainly this lady wasn't struggling. Now your fallacy aside, people making over $250k are better off than 95% of Americans who are better off than 95% of the world. You really want to bend over backwards to help them at the expense of the entire country? Steve Forbes, is that you?\n \n \nYou can't group all \"rich\" people in the same classification, that is, saying they all \"have\" it, and therefore have a certain percentage that the government is entitled to. The rich are probably more diverse than any other income group, in terms of how they do (or don't) contribute to society, or how much money they can easily have taxed away from them. \nAnd you know this how? Frankly, I don't mind my tax rates going up and I doubt others making over $250k will not be able to afford it. Until you come up with a better plan to solve our financial crisis I suggest you sit down.\n \n \nHow can you blame previous generations for our financial problems? We're no less guilty today than any previous generation.\nHow can I blame them? They are the ones that set up the entitlement programs that benefited themselves and put the tab on future generations. This fact is undeniable. The only fault of current generations is that they bend over backwards to try and keep the scam going.",

   "I was wondering if someone would ask this...you didn't disappoint. Let's say you have a degree in English. This is an undesirable degree. Now, you have two options with this degree if you have been laid off from work (assuming you want another job) 1) Get another degree 2) wait for a job in that degree. Would you agree? If you choose number 2 than it is more desirable to find someone that is still working, even if part time or in an unrelated field (think Cashier at your local grocery store) than someone who has been sitting at home on unemployment. \n \n But more towards you comment, I'm not implying anything about the desirability of traits in my post to you. After all, non desirable traits are still desirable from time to time but simple supply and demand tend to make things more difficult.\n\n \n For starters, why is it the \"degree\" that's at issue here? If I took an undergraduate degree in English, then went to grad school for a doctorate, and now have ten years of experience teaching college level writing classes, that's a rather different skill-set than taking the same undergraduate degree, then getting a job in the private sector, where I now have fifteen years of experience in sales. Depending on which way I go after the degree, I could have totally different skill sets.\n \n And my point was, if I've lost my job, applied for others, and gotten interviews, then it is by that very fact not the case that the skills I've developed, whether in college or after, are \"undesirable.\" It may well be the case that there are other people whose levels of skill or other qualifications are deemed higher than my own. Or maybe my personality is judged a less than good fit for the organization. Whatever.\n \n But my point is that in such a case, the reason for hiring someone else rather than me is not that my skills themselves are undesirable. In other words, I'm suggesting that when people get interviews but fail, the \"undesirable skills\" claim is false.\n \n \nAny good employer would know that you can't learn anything from a resume or interview. What you can tell is if you are a hard worker or not by looking at your job history (which I admit is on the resume so kinda shoot myself in the foot there). Not only that but you are waiting around for a job to open up in your field. That shows lack of effort to me.\n\n \n Why does it show that? In my rust-belt state and region, unemployment is still at double-digits -- and it just rose again. I know people personally who have asked about jobs at grocery stores (to pick up your suggestion), and been told that the stores aren't hiring. Those jobs got snapped up long ago.\n \n It's this moralization of the issue that bugs me so much. When a long-time factory worker with a good work history sees his factory close down, he loses his job through no fault of his own at all. When such conditions have hit a whole area hard, the number of other jobs available is low, again through no fault of his own. And as those job losses mount, the local labor market gets flooded with job-seekers, making it that much harder to find work on the merits. Having a completely unfounded prejudice about the laziness of the unemployed certainly doesn't help matters.\n \n \nSo let me recap here since it seems you are confusing a few different things:\n \n One, extending unemployment detracts from people being forced to accept a job in a field that is actually hiring.\n\n \n Let me repeat, that this is not the issue I was discussing. I was talking about the prejudice against hiring people who've been long-term unemployed, even when they're sitting right in front of you. In other words, the person has accepted that this job is one that they should apply for, whether it's ideal or not, and that's why they did in fact apply for it, and even showed up for the interview.\n \n I was not talking about whether or not unemployment benefits should be extended. I was talking about whether people who've accepted exactly what you say they should, should then also get kicked in the teeth as if they were too lazy to accept it.\n \n I daresay that it's not me who's confused.\n \n \nTwo, assuming you are chronically unemployed in a field not desired, an employer would be better off going first with someone who still has a job in that field because they are considered (and more than likely accurately so) to be in the swing of things AND good enough to not get laid off and second going with someone who has a job even if unrelated because it shows a willingness to \"do what it takes\" as I say. Now, keep in mind my second point is obviously not universally true. I don't speak for all employers, however, there have been several articles and interviews on the subject recently and it seems like a fair conclusion. I'd also like to point out that my second point might not necessarily be \"fair\" but it is what it is.\n\n \n And as I've already said, if the person hasn't stayed current with recent developments, then fine, maybe they're not well qualfied after all. But why assume that someone is unqualified for the position that you've decided to interview them for, just because they're unemployed? That is the problem. Why waste the time of both interviewer and interviewee by calling them in, if the fact that they're unemployed disqualifies them.\n \n \nYou can't really deny the fact, you read the articles yourself! I'm merely telling you why this is the case and why it is the best move for an employer. Clearly the employer's agree.\n\n \n Actually, I think that any employer who would agree with this is neither morally decent nor particularly smart. I'm not talking about an honest assessment of qualifications. I'm talking about unjustifiable prejudice.\n \n -----\n \n Post Edit Supplement:\n \n Seriously, let's think about the inference from an employers' perspective:\n \n 1. You have applied for a job with my company.\n 2. But you are unemployed.\n 3. Therefore, you are not really interested in looking for work, despite 1.\n \n 1. You have come for an interview with my company, an interview to which we invited you.\n 2. But you are unemployed.\n 3. Therefore, you are not really interested in looking for work, despite 1.\n \n In both cases, the conclusion is completely contradicted by the initial premise. And in the second case, since the employer even invited the interviewee, it's even more ridiculous. What possible realistic basis can there be for this conclusion?...\n \n Hint: moralistic prejudice, nothing more.",

When you comment about them only hiring people who are still employed I suggested that this makes since because if you choose from 100 people for 10 positions it is better to keep people that are 1) in the swing of things related to that skill and then (if not available) 2)someone who is still employed in an unrelated field as they are still used to working. Again, this may not be fair but it is clearly what the employer is doing (as you admitted). Given how hard it is to find a good employee I understand why they use that method.

Having a completely unfounded prejudice about the laziness of the unemployed certainly doesn't help matters.\nIf I ever implied that unemployed people are lazy I apologize. Many are clearly not. The question does become are you going to sit around and be upset over it or are you going to make something happen. You can't change the world but you can change yourself. So no matter how much you kick and scream about more factory jobs in Ohio the chances are small it will happen. Perhaps you should man up and find another career no matter how difficult or unfair that may be. Extended unemployment benefits only delays this realization which hurts the country and the unemployed person. \n \n \nLet me repeat, that this is not the issue I was discussing.

I am only pointing out that they are two separate issues. It appears you agree. \n \n Now, it appears your point is on treatment during the hiring process of the employed vs unemployed. I answered this by merely stating I understand where the employer is coming from. They want the best person they can get and an already employed person is the safest bet because in reality you don't know if the person is going to be a good worker until they actually start work. Whether this is unfair or not is irrelevant because this is clearly the thinking.\n \n \nAnd as I've already said, if the person hasn't stayed current with recent developments, then fine, maybe they're not well qualified after all. But why assume that someone is unqualified for the position that you've decided to interview them for, just because they're unemployed? That is the problem. Why waste the time of both interviewer and interviewee by calling them in, if the fact that they're unemployed disqualifies them.\nThere is probably a host of reasons for this. I know we have to interview a certain number of people with certain backgrounds even if we know who we are going to hire prior to the interviews. \n \n So why they call you in could be a number of things but if I had to take a stab at it I'm guessing it has a lot to do with political correctness.\n \n Frankly it doesn't matter because it is what it is.",

   "I'm not sure if this is a political discussion or a personal one.\n \n On a personal level, I would be seriously considering migrating if the job market was that awful. Come down to Australia, unemployment is 5.2% after peaking at 5.8% in the GFC. Surely life in the \"rust belt\" can't be all that amazing, it sounds pretty sour actually. You'll be back to dealing with inflated housing prices, like the US' good old days. Maybe by the time our bubble crashes things will have turned around back home. Maybe not. Not sure what you have to lose.\n \n \n It isn't really irrational to preference hiring towards people with jobs over the short term unemployed, or short term unemployed over long term unemployed. No more irrational than most other hiring methods in practice. Fortunately for the long term unemployed, this tendency isn't universal. Unfortunately for the long term unemployed, most of them were at some time only short term unemployed, so logically it isn't only being long term unemployed that's standing in their way, even in a strong economy.\n \n It is irrational to become focused on the negatives of your situation and aspects of it you can't control. The real danger the long term unemployed face is that when they do get an interview with somebody who is willing to give them a shot, they come across as jaded, dejected, bitter, unmotivated or hostile.

The maintainence of any lifestyle in a society of free markets is no one's business except that of the person living it. \n \n \nGiven the choice between financial ruin of the country or taxing the upper 5% an additional 3%, I don't think \"i want to keep my BMW\" is a great argument. \n\n \n That would be true if that additional tax was guaranteed to offset the financial ruin of the country to any degree, but it never is. Past experience shows that it can make it worse. \n \n \nI don't have much sympathy for either. \n\n \n As a conservative, I do. I have sympathy for a 3 man lawncare service, with each man including the owner making $20k a year, who loses a customer because that customer was taxed out of their luxury home by the government. \n \n \n And if you can't afford an additional 3% than perhaps you got bigger problems in the not to distant feature.

The growth of government and increased spending never stops. More taxes always equals more spending. \n \n \n Certainly this lady wasn't struggling. \n\n \n How do you know that? Maybe she cares for one, or more handicapped, or elderly people. It doesn't take much of that to gobble up $200k per year. \n \n \n Now your fallacy aside, people making over $250k are better off than 95% of Americans who are better off than 95% of the world. You really want to bend over backwards to help them at the expense of the entire country? Steve Forbes, is that you? \n\n \n They don't need to be helped. They need to be left alone. \n \n \nAnd you know this how? [that high income people are diverse in their circumstances] \n\n \n I know a few people who own small businesses, and see the problems they face with government regulations and employees who take advantage of them every chance they get. I drive around a medium sized US city and see countless small business warehouses and shops sitting empty with for sale signs in the yards. Statistics show that there are a lot of people who are considered \"rich\" in one decade, and are not rich in the following decade. All this jealously of the rich that sets an income level and declares anyone on or above it as having not a care in the world is phony. For every millionaire like Derrick Jeter, there are hundreds if not thousands of $250,000airs who just planted that for sale sign at their closed business, and drove away in a luxury car that's about to be repossessed. \n \n \n Frankly, I don't mind my tax rates going up and I doubt others making over $250k will not be able to afford it. \n\n \n Being able to afford it isn't the issue. It's about the long term effects of penalizing success. The more success is penalized, the fewer people will have any incentive to become successful. (this is conservatism 101)\n \n \n Until you come up with a better plan to solve our financial crisis I suggest you sit down. \n\n \n [standing up] As Dave Ramsey would say, we don't have an income problem, we have a behavior problem. The government never stops with new ways to spend.It seems a day doesn't go by when we don't hear of new school lunch programs, new handout programs, new regulations on business. Increases on taxes equals increases in new spending everytime! \n \n Here's an example for you - while this is at the state level, it's similar to what the federal government also does;\n \n It's always been a long time requirement (nationwide) for drivers of heavy trucks and buses (over 26,000 lbs in most cases) to have a medical card, that is, a yearly or semi yearly certification that they're physically fit enough to safely operate the vehicle they make a living with. That's fine, it makes sense, most people agree that's a good thing. Since I'm in that business and operate in Ohio, I recently got a letter from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio that this medical card requirement will now go all the way down to vehicles weighing 10,000 lbs. This is only slightly more than the full size SUV's. It will include countless thousands of utility trucks and vans (most all the UPS and FedX vans, for example) Why did they do that? Has there been a recent drastic increase in highway fatalities because of physically unfit people driving these vehicles? Of course not, it's simply more government, and wasteful spending. Now, after sitting in a doctors waiting room for 4 or 5 hours, millions more people spend a minute with the doctor, \"open wide and say ahhhh, you're fine, that will be $75, NEXT!\" The medical profession rakes in most of the money, but in taxes, kickbacks and bribes, the state of Ohio will do quite well also. Owners of businesses that use these vehicles now have to find a way to cover it, and it's all completely wasted money. \n \n You'll never get every one to sit down, who thinks that this kind of behavior by government at the state and federal level needs to stop and stay stopped long before there are new tax increases on anybody. I know you're thinking \"fat chance of that, it won't stop in any civilized, peaceful way\", then why is a tax increase going to solve anything? \n \n \nHow can you blame previous generations for our financial problems? We're no less guilty today than any previous generation. \n\n How can I blame them? They are the ones that set up the entitlement programs that benefited themselves and put the tab on future generations. This fact is undeniable. \n\n \n Who is \"they\"? Can you name some specific time periods? Are you referring to FDR, Reagan, who? \n \n \n \n The only fault of current generations is that they bend over backwards to try and keep the scam going.\n\n \n I don't think there's a clear distinction between who initiated the scam and who simply keeps it going. Or even what the \"scam\" is.",

   "It's not insulting to me, and it shouldn't be to you if you're an actual conservative. What is, or isn't a luxury lifestyle is subjective, that is, subject to interpretation and not clearly definable. The maintainence of any lifestyle in a society of free markets is no one's business except that of the person living it. \nYou have to be a pretty big a-hole to complain about something petty in front of people that have lost so much. It would be like you being sad about your wife or husband dying and someone going up to you and saying \"yeah, I got it bad too; my cat died\". \n \n \nThat would be true if that additional tax was guaranteed to offset the financial ruin of the country to any degree, but it never is. Past experience shows that it can make it worse. \nTrue, congress probably wouldn't use it to offset our financial ruin but considering the \"tea party\" supposedly took over the budget making branch of Congress you'd think we would be able to. Are you implying that you basically think the next Congress will be just as bad as the previous?\n \n \nAs a conservative, I do. I have sympathy for a 3 man lawncare service, with each man including the owner making $20k a year, who loses a customer because that customer was taxed out of their luxury home by the government. \nAgain, given the choice between a 3 man lawncare service staying in business or the 3 man lawncare service being an extinct profession in an extinct country I choose the former.\n \n \nThat's a nice dream, but it will never happen under current circumstances. The growth of government and increased spending never stops. More taxes always equals more spending. \nSo is your argument that we should just keep taxes the same and increase spending so we drive the bus into the wall faster? Seems you are implying a \"take it while you an get it\" attitude. \n \n \nHow do you know that? Maybe she cares for one, or more handicapped, or elderly people. It doesn't take much of that to gobble up $200k per year. \nThat is all tax deductible for one and second, she said she wasn't. \n \n \nI know a few people who own small businesses, and see the problems they face with government regulations and employees who take advantage of them every chance they get.\nSmall businesses make up 1% of the people who make over $250,000 a year. It's over for them if they get a 3% increase?\n \n \nI drive around a medium sized US city and see countless small business warehouses and shops sitting empty with for sale signs in the yards. \nThen they probably are not making over $250k now are they?\n \n \nStatistics show that there are a lot of people who are considered \"rich\" in one decade, and are not rich in the following decade.\nSo? \n \n \nFor every millionaire like Derrick Jeter, there are hundreds if not thousands of $250,000airs who just planted that for sale sign at their closed business, and drove away in a luxury car that's about to be repossessed. \nUmm, you clearly do not understand how taxes work, do you? You are suggesting to me that this person took out $250k from their failing business and then shut that business down. First off, that doesn't exactly seem very nice of the owner. Secondly, small business are often times pass-through entities so depending on the basis and other factories they probably don't owe taxes that year or would be under the 250k threshold. \n \n \nBeing able to afford it isn't the issue. It's about the long term effects of penalizing success. The more success is penalized, the fewer people will have any incentive to become successful. (this is conservatism 101)\nRunning a government isn't free. I'd like to see how many people go from wanting to make $250k+ at 36% vs 39% tax rate. I doubt you'd see much of a change. In fact, you can see it during the tax increase of the 90s. Filings for people in the top bracket didn't go down but increased at the same rate as previous years...inline with economic growth at the time. \n \n \n\"standing up\" As Dave Ramsey would say, we don't have an income problem, we have a behavior problem. The government never stops with new ways to spend.It seems a day doesn't go by when we don't hear of new school lunch programs, new handout programs, new regulations on business. Increases on taxes equals increases in new spending everytime! \nI always here this. \"Reduce spending\". Show me what spending to reduce. Are you prepared to halve every government entity overnight? That's the spending cuts we'd have to do immediately to achieve that goal. After that we'd have to figure out how to explain the fact that we aren't paying back the social security bonds issued without every country immediately stopping their purchases of treasuries. \n \n Maybe you want unemployment at 20% overnight but I'd rather us ease out of the problem with more realistic 15% cuts and increases taxes on the rich temporarily. \n \n\n Here's an example for you - while this is at the state level, it's similar to what the federal government also does;\n \n It's always been a long time requirement (nationwide) for drivers of heavy trucks and buses (over 26,000 lbs in most cases) to have a medical card, that is, a yearly or semi yearly certification that they're physically fit enough to safely operate the vehicle they make a living with. That's fine, it makes sense, most people agree that's a good thing. Since I'm in that business and operate in Ohio, I recently got a letter from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio that this medical card requirement will now go all the way down to vehicles weighing 10,000 lbs. This is only slightly more than the full size SUV's. It will include countless thousands of utility trucks and vans (most all the UPS and FedX vans, for example) Why did they do that? Has there been a recent drastic increase in highway fatalities because of physically unfit people driving these vehicles? Of course not, it's simply more government, and wasteful spending. Now, after sitting in a doctors waiting room for 4 or 5 hours, millions more people spend a minute with the doctor, \"open wide and say ahhhh, you're fine, that will be $75, NEXT!\" The medical profession rakes in most of the money, but in taxes, kickbacks and bribes, the state of Ohio will do quite well also. Owners of businesses that use these vehicles now have to find a way to cover it, and it's all completely wasted money. \nAnd how much money would Ohio's government have saved by not doing this? Even if you had 10,000 programs like that you probably wouldn't save much. \n \n Fake conservatives think the federal government has little pet projects that amount to $2 trillion a year. Unfortunately this is not the case. \"Pork\" spending is a very small percentage of spending. Medicare, SSA, and Defense eat up the entire revenue stream alone. \n \n \nYou'll never get every one to sit down, who thinks that this kind of behavior by government at the state and federal level needs to stop and stay stopped long before there are new tax increases on anybody. I know you're thinking \"fat chance of that, it won't stop in any civilized, peaceful way\", then why is a tax increase going to solve anything? \n\n If it saves money than do it but show me a plan where tax increases aren't needed to balance the budget in a reasonable time frame and I'm all for it.\n \n \n\n Who is \"they\"? Can you name some specific time periods? Are you referring to FDR, Reagan, who? \nBaby boomers. Anyone that is about ready to or is already on Social Security and Medicare.",
