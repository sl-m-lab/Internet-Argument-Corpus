We all believe that murder is wrong right? Here is the definition for murder:\n To kill (another human) unlawfully. \n To kill brutally or inhumanly. \n To put an end to; destroy: murdered their chances.\n The last definition, murdered their chaces, is exactly what we are doing to the not yet born but very much alive infants. When you get an abortion you are murdering their chances to life and the right they have to live. Plus how is killing the child making the mother not missing a part of herself? The child is gone both ways, but adoption is letting the child have his/her right to live. \n \n \n So i apologize for this but you have to look away from the facts and look at it like a normal human being.

Incarcaration vs execution? Life vs death?\n I don't really believe the death penalty is violation of a culture of life (note I am not saying I support the death penalty). Be that as it may, I live in the USA and since I understand this culture the best I find no reason not to use my culture in examples.",

I especially find it interesting that you fault certain perspectives for being closed minded, when you say \"I'm not gonna change my mind...\" That is close minded. In \"thinking outside of the box,\" you have closed your mind to, among other things, that which is inside of the box. That's fine, you're free to do that. \n \n If you really don't expect to change anyone's mind, or have yours changed, then why bother posting here. Why bother telling us that \"A woman that has an abortion has the right NOT to be chastised by her church, her friends, or even the parishoneers that belong to her church?\" This subject is obviously something you feel very strongly about. I wonder what it is that has promted your ranting in these forums thought. I observe two underlying themes throughout your posts. 1) we need to be open minded (and see that abortion is permissable) and 2) churches are crappy. You've likely seen something you didn't like regarding how a church handles abortion which has in turn completely biased your opinion to the degree that you would rather dictate to us your self-proclaimed worthless opinion, rather then submit your position with reasoned arguments so that they can be discussed rationally.

   "Here is a the formal challenge\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=186034#post186034\n \n \n But Just to recap...\n \n You started out saying:\n \nPro-life have this problem you see -- they don't want to pay for other people's babies but they don't want abortion / baby corpses out on the road either.\n\n \n I Then responed with:\n \nDo you realize that there was a time when abortion was illegal and that dead infants were not just lining the streets. Stop with straw-man arguments that you hold so dear.\n\n \n You responded with\n \nPlease... abortions were done illegally in spite of the law, and there are many places and times in the world where infants are simply dumped and abandoned.\n \n Indeed infants are abandoned to this day, all it takes is a hungry fox/ feral dog to kill it before a human finds it\n This has two claims in it. 1) that abortion were done illegally in spite of the law...no one is denying that. 2) there are places (and times) in the world where babies are abandoned. No one is denying this either because it happens even in the United States where I live.\n \n I responded with:\n \nBesides, the amount of illegal abortions was not that many and you still didn't disprove my fact that we didn't have infants dumped on the side of the road all day long.\n\n This is where I was trying to get you to tie in abortion with increases in dumped babies.\n \n You responded with:\n \n\n First you yourself make a baseless comment saying \"the amount of illegal abortions was not that many\" then you suggest I need to disprove some baseless comment you previously made.\n\n \n I responded trying to press you further into proving your claim since you didn't exactly answer my question in the previous post..\n \nWell, look at any other coutnry that had abortion illegal and then legal. How many babies were left on the streets because abortion was illegal...not that many. Your orginial claim was that they would leave them on the streets, you can't support that fact. I, however, can support mine in the US and have no reason to believe it wouldn't work in other similiar countries.\n\n \n Here you respond with the only thing that MIGHT be considered evidence which is your own personal accounts of seeing pictures. However, it still didn't tie it in with abortion as I point out in my response.\n \n \n\n I've seen pictures... just look at china where they have laws regarding amounts of children. It is desireable to have a male child because they can better look after (earning power) when you are older (plus pass on the family name etc). I have seen pictures of female babies corpses just left on the road side.\n \n Abandonment of babies happens all the time in the UK, often I see it in the news with the police appealing for the mother to come forward.\n\n \n My response:\n \n...I asked you to provide evidence that countries with abortion being illegal will have babies thrown in streets, you just provide me with countries that have abortion legal and babies thrown in streets...\n\n \n You then said:\n \nI was using china as an example to show you that people when desperate, trying to get around laws (in this case the 1 child law), will abandon their children to death in the gutter -- it was unrelated to abortion laws -- it was an illustration of as aspect of human nature, which you deny.\n Now wait?!?! Where did I deny that humans can abandoned babies? I kept harping about tieing in with abortion but I never denied that babies are abandoned. Seems you are mistaken there. You aslo don't tie it into abortion here (as you admitted actually).\n \n I call you on not answering me:\n \nWhat? My point is that if abortion was illegal then you wouldn't see dead baby in the streets...you either are building a strawman or missed my point. If you can provide evidence in other countries that having abortion being illegal will cause babies in streets then please show...but if one is pro-choice then you would think the mother (say in china) has every right to put there child in the street.\n\n \n The first time you try to tie the two together is here:\n \nNow onto the other issue... I feel I have proven that (a) abandoning babies to circumvent laws is a plausible human behaviour (b) that people already abandon babies today in my own culture without the added pressure of abortion being a criminal offence.\n \n I feel quite safe to say that, based on the above two facts, making abortion illegal will plausibly result in more babies being abandoned.\n \n You did prove A and you did prove B but those were never in question. However with B you never showed how \"added pressure\" of abortion will cause babies to be abandoned. The way I see it, the only way you could make this claim would be to say that if you got rid of ANY law then the amount of abandoned babies would go down. Otherwise you just assume abortion being a crime is an added pressure to abandon a baby. \n \n Here I said something similiar to my above statement and I provided evidence in one country (the US) where your claim is not true.\n \nYou can't make that conclusion because it didn't happen when abortion was illegal. You haven't proven that the added \"pressure\" of abortion being illegal will cause more abandoned babies. I keep asking you to provide evidence for this and you can't. We didn't see a decrease in abandoned babies here in the US when abortion became legal. China obviously has a lot of babies on the streets and they abort the most! The amount of abandoned babies in the United States has actually increased over the past 15yrs ( i pick you US cause I can't find it anywhere else). So I don't see any correlation between abortion being illegal and abandoned babies increasing.\n http://www.acf.hhs.gov/news/stats/abandon.htm\n \n\n \n You respond with a few things here:\n \n(A) Prove it.\n (B) You can't prove it because nothing can ever be proven to the satisfaction of both parties on an internet message board.\n (C) You're reffering to just America again when I was reffering to a world view.\n You ask me to prove something when you make the claim? Hmm. \n \n\n I have proven that making abortion illegal will plausibly result in more babies being abandoned.\n It is safe to say that you didn't really prove this but rather stated it as shown in my above statements. You also said that my evidence was not good because it could be for many reasons. However, you had a claim with no evidence other then pictures you say...obviously that could be for only one reason emoticon_confused \n \n I responded with:\n \nWhere? You have said that people abandoned children to avoid some laws and you have said that people still abandon babies today. You haven't shown how this applies to abortion laws. You can't provide evidence that people would avoid abortion laws by abadoning you just begged the question instead. It doesn't appear that a correlation exists at all in the United States (which is part of a world view) so at best you would have to say that you are assuming it would happen for the rest of the world.\n\n \n You responed with (among other things):\n \nI have proved abandonment of children to side step laws in a plausible human behaviour.\n \n I have not mentioned abortion law in the context of that point no matter how much you try to imply I have.\n \n My only mention regarding abortion law, was that if it was to become illegal it wouldn't eradicate abortion as per your original objective (before you changed it all [see below]).\n You haven't mentioned aboriton law? What about when you said \"I have proven that making abortion illegal will plausibly result in more babies being abandoned\"?.\n \n I then challenged you to a debate on this.",
