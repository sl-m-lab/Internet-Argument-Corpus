   "Since our illustrious admin has restored my moderator powers for this forum, I'd like to know if there is any penned up desire on your part to participate in or judge formal debates. It's been a while since we had one here, so I'm hoping that I can cajole a few intelligent souls to try your hand at formal debating.\n I will help you with writing a resolution, finding an opponent, moderating and/or judging. Just drop me a PM or post your challenge and see who bites.",

On there people didn't really care if they committed obvious informal (and sometimes even formal) fallacies, it was more of a shouting match with insults and caps.\n\n \n My advice would be to peruse the forums and get a feel for the place before diving into the formal debate arena. The reason I say this is we've had newbies join the forum saying that they wanted to engage in a formal debate only to disappear after we went through the trouble of finding an opponent, judges, etc., \n We don't want to wast time on fruitless endeavors, so engage in some informal debating before tackling a formal one.\n \n Oh...and welcome to the forum. I'm the moderator for the formal debate area.",
