   "Speaking of monopolies:\n \n Why can&#8217;t a monopoly exist? It can if it is created via the government. Patents create monopolies.\n \n It is very difficult for them to exist in a free market. Here is why: Lets say you lower your prices to put the competitor out of business. Lets say you lower them so low that you lose money. You sustain that for some time until you are the only company left doing whatever it is you do.\n \n The natural goal of a monopoly is to raise prices. You do so. Soon there is huge profits to be reaped. Others see your profits and want to join in. Capital is shifted into competing with your business. Well, you sold at a loss for years to put your competition out of business. You can&#8217;t do this forever. Now you are competing against others that did not carry the years of losses you did in creating your monopoly.\n \n \n \n Monopolies can be good also. Standard Oil is an example how trust busting can fail the society. It may have set back alternative fuel research. There is no reason to investigate alternative forms of energy if gasoline is so cheap. How can other forms of alternative energy compete?

   "\n Eminent Domain is the Constitution, and is a method for the state to take land and use it for their purposes. I don't mind that usually, but many times the cities will use this authority to take land (usually from the smaller business person) and give it to Costco.\n \n Many cities have taken it a step further. Cities have enacted legislation that permits the creation of Redevelopment Agencies. These agencies typically take land (the pay fair market value or more of course) and sell it to a larger corporation. I have yet to see these agencies take land from a Large Corporation like Costco and give it to the small companies. \n \n\n \n Our city just settled an eminent domain lawsuit (in favor of the original land owner) that was seven years old. There are three other lawsuits pending on the same issue, property valuation. Redevelopment agencies actually have the ability to pay assessed value for property condemned under eminent domain legislation, disregarding market prices 'for the good of the community'. When the property owner files a lawsuit to recover the difference between assessed and market value (the assessed valuation can't be accepted by the property owner as it constitues acceptance of the terms), the public agency merely uses its deep pockets to drag it out until the property owner is financially ruined and settles for peanuts. The old adage of 'You can't fight city hall' has become even more of a truism now that they have virtually unlimited empowerment to take private property and ruin the property owner in the process.",

   "I don?t think that mergers are the biggest culprit in the creation of mega-corporations. I would like to see more evidence. I have given several examples on how laws have helped the big guy over the small guy. \n \n In this thread or others about capitalism there were some examples of how temporary monopolies can benefit the society. I stated a reason in post 11 that explains why collusion in price fixing does not work forever. \n \n I disagree for the same reasons I have been giving all along. There may be some legislation that was passed that has kept corporations small (Anti-trust) but did it really benefit the society?\n\n \n This could be answered depending on whether you think that competition is good for society. But let's look at your post 11\n \n \nSpeaking of monopolies:\n Why can?t a monopoly exist? It can if it is created via the government. Patents create monopolies.\n\n Patents don't equat to monopolies. You can use your patent to gain money by selling your idea out.\n \nIt is very difficult for them to exist in a free market. Here is why: Lets say you lower your prices to put the competitor out of business. Lets say you lower them so low that you lose money. You sustain that for some time until you are the only company left doing whatever it is you do.\n The natural goal of a monopoly is to raise prices. You do so. Soon there is huge profits to be reaped. Others see your profits and want to join in. Capital is shifted into competing with your business. Well, you sold at a loss for years to put your competition out of business. You can?t do this forever. Now you are competing against others that did not carry the years of losses you did in creating your monopoly.\n\n Monopolies can be good also. Standard Oil is an example how trust busting can fail the society. It may have set back alternative fuel research. There is no reason to investigate alternative forms of energy if gasoline is so cheap. How can other forms of alternative energy compete? If Rockefeller was allowed to keep his monopoly, and allowed to raise the price of gas, other people would have investigated alternative forms of energy. What do they say ?Gasoline is cheaper than bottled water?? Why switch?\n That is my opinion.[/quote]\n No, Standard Oil is the standard example of bad big business. They used price-fixing with the railways etc to put businesses to the wall. That is what rampant capitalism does - allows hard-working small business to be destroyed by companies using foul play.",

Moreover, there were at least 147 other domestic oil-refining competitors in the market &#8212; and some of these were large, vertically integrated firms such as Texaco, Gulf Oil, and Sun. Kerosene outputs had expanded enormously (contrary to usual monopolistic conduct); and prices for kerosene had fallen from more than $2 per gallon in the early 1860s to approximately six cents per gallon at the time of the trial. So much for the myth of the Standard Oil \"monopoly.\"\n \n &#8230;Don't the antitrust laws stop monopolistic practices?\n \n Absolutely not. Harmful monopolies from the old AT&T monopoly (created by government regulations), to the U.S. Post Office monopoly were created by the state. The U.S. Post Office, for example, maintains its monopoly on the lucrative first class mail market by having the state outlaw its competition.\n \n Take for example Judge Learned Hand's indictment of ALCOA. What 'crimes' was ALCOA punished for? To quote Hand:\n \n \"It was not inevitable that it should always anticipate increases in the demand for ingot and be prepared to supply them. Nothing compelled it to keep doubling and redoubling its capacity before others entered the field.

He doesn't say.\n And the key to this is found in this paragraph...\n \"Federal Trade Commission Chairman Robert Pitofsky said Greenspan was advocating letting all mergers proceed and then wait and see if action was necessary. \"I don't agree with that,\" Pitofsky said.\"\n Ibid.\n In other words he's not pro-monopoly in an absolute sense.

This does not seem consistent.\n \n Here is where I am consistent: I believe the government should protect our property rights, but I don&#8217;t consider words on paper property.\n \n \n Your argument is all over the place.

It is not about creating a 'monopoly' it is about protecting property.\n \n\n \n That is your opinion. Why is it not protected like property forever?\n \n \n They are different things. If I own something, I have exclusive rights to it. That is not a monopoly. A monopoly is where we are in competition and you drive me and competitors out of business. \n\n \n Just because someone drives someone out of business does not make that person a monopoly.

I was wondering when you would bring that up. Let me ask you a question: Recently pharmaceutical companies have been wanting to extend the length of a patent from 17 to 20 years. They claim that it would bring down the price of drugs. What do you think? I would rather see a five year patent that raising it to 20 or 50 years.\n \n \n How do you prove this? It's not like saying \"If not for settlers, the Dodo would still be around\". \n\n \n This is what can be proved: Some hundred years or so after the breakup of Standard Oil, we are still driving to the supermarket using petroleum products. It would be likely that if gas prices were higher, alternative forms of energy would be used.\n \n \n I'm not sure that Microsoft is a competitor of IBM. \n\n \n IBM basically had sales people that helped train employees how to use their equipment. It was quite an operation. With Windows you could train a monkey to use a computer. \n \n \n I agree that monopolies are a product of unrestrained capitalism, which is why I'm not in favour of unrestrained capitalism.

   "Saying something is alike something else is to make it an analogy. You said that a patent (a form of protection over property) creates a monopoly. I stated that other forms of property protection would also therefore be 'monopolies' as with an example from real property where-by regardless of how much I might like the view from your land I can't use it without your permission.\n Hence an extension of your analogy - equating patents with monopolies, shows the flaw in your logic. It remains your analogy. I simply extended it to show other forms of property - including other forms of intellectual property - such as a screen-play. And you disputed that a screen-play could be shown to be original. This interpretation would have fundamental consequences (were it to be adapted) to property law.\n\n \nHere is where you are wrong: I don?t believe patents should be protected because I don?t consider ideas property. This nullifies the rest of the first paragraph. \n\n I am not wrong. Just because you offer an opinion that ideas aren't property doesn't negate the consensus of law-making bodies the world over that such things are property, and therefore should be protected. It is odd way to say 'no it isn't' and insist then that that rebuttal has destroyed my argument. I cited many a law sites that deal with it. If you want to actually offer why you feel it should not be protected, please do so. You've had several days to offer this, but the best offered is your repeating of a previously stated opinion.\n \nIf you are against monopolies, then why should some one be able to monopolize their property? Shouldn?t anyone be able to build on it? This does not seem consistent.\n\n \nHere is where I am consistent: I believe the government should protect our property rights, but I don?t consider words on paper property.\n\n Yes, I know you don't. I don't know 'why' you don't other than 'just because'.\n \nYour argument is all over the place. You asked why can't monopolies exist because patents are alike monopolies. You said 'patents create monopolies. It is not about creating a 'monopoly' it is about protecting property.\n\n \nThat is your opinion. Why is it not protected like property forever?\n\n Why? That is because it has been legislated like that. Even property has protection that is not absolute. Property can be acquired by the government for the 'national interest'. There are rules that allow police to enter your property, even should you not want them there - such as when they have probable cause.\n What rights are defined, or rather, how they defined is really a matter for government. That they are defined in different ways still does not negate that they offer protection.\n \nThey are different things. If I own something, I have exclusive rights to it. That is not a monopoly. A monopoly is where we are in competition and you drive me and competitors out of business. \n\n \nJust because someone drives someone out of business does not make that person a monopoly. Even if a person were to drive EVERYONE out of that business, does not mean the monopoly will be permanent.\n\n These are two different statements.\n If someone drove every competitor out of business, and their own business continued, that is a monopoly, because it is so defined.\n That a monopoly, un-hampered by government regulations (including regulations towards would-be competitors) would or would not last forever is the heart of your argument. You assume that it wouldn't based on an as yet ill-defined reason. It's not been tested - as far as I know. You've certainly offered no evidence of known cases. But then it's a very difficult proposition for you to prove.\n \nYou question whether intellectual property exists? It is really property. It is a field of law.\n Studied at Berkley\n http://www.law.berkeley.edu/institu...02/ipintro.html\n and at Columbus\n http://faculty.cua.edu/fischer/Intr...3/IP%20Home.htm\n In part regulated by Copyright\n http://www.copyright.gov/\n legislated around the world\n http://www.worldlii.org/catalog/2296.html\n It is most strange that you don't 'believe' that it exists. \n\n \nI agree that is what the law says. The whole point to this discussion is that I don?t believe the law should say this.\n\n Yes, again I know you don't. Why?\n If I write a book, why should I not be able to prevent you making a movie from it without proper compensation to me? I would equally be intrigued to learn if you pirate movies and music - why, or why not? You certainly argue a case that can be construed as being pro-product piracy.\n \nI work with legal practitioners. I studied law very briefly in a formal sense(I have a habit of this - not completing studies; having attended at least six different universities), and for much longer in an informal sense (I have lots of time on my hands). However, it would suggest that if solicitors, barristers and other legal practitioners are all dealing with it, and you don't think it exists, this would seem that one of you is wrong. \n\n \nThe people that may be wrong are the ones with a vested interest in it. \n\n Yes, the people who's rights are protected have a vested interest. You have a vested interest in your own property being protected.\n \nI have taken some Business Law Classes. I have also taken some RE Law classes.\n\n Cool. You probably have more formal qualifications than I do; in regards to law.\n \nI don't define property. I give you definitions found in law. You define things not according to law, but your sense of injustice towards money-grubbing legal workers. \n\n \nAgain, it is the law I question.\n\n Good. But why? Also, you would need to tie this back into your 'monopolies' argument as we're both guilty of being side-tracked\n \n Regardless, your assertion that it can't be defined as being original is wrong. It is fortunate too, because if not for this many hard working artists; screen-writers, musicians etc would have their efforts come to nothing, because people who don't believe their work is original would feel free to take it for themselves.\n It is one thing to argue that what they are doing is self-serving, money grubbing etc, and a totally different argument that the rights of intellectual property don't exist. \n\n \nMonty, that is the best argument for patents, copyrights and trademarks. I was wondering when you would bring that up. Let me ask you a question: Recently pharmaceutical companies have been wanting to extend the length of a patent from 17 to 20 years. They claim that it would bring down the price of drugs. What do you think? I would rather see a five year patent that raising it to 20 or 50 years.\n\n I have no opinion on the actual length of a patent. I have stated that property should be protected, but have also given examples where this is not an absolute right. A case in South Africa was finished recently where people sought to have vital AIDS-fighting drugs manufactured without recourse to patented laws - because the drugs were deemed to be needed right away. I can certainly see that this justifies a waiving of patent protection. Does this mean I want all patent laws removed? No.\n (see http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa/04/19/safrica.drugs/)\n \nHow do you prove this? It's not like saying \"If not for settlers, the Dodo would still be around\". \n\n \nThis is what can be proved: Some hundred years or so after the break-up of Standard Oil, we are still driving to the supermarket using petroleum products. It would be likely that if gas prices were higher, alternative forms of energy would be used.\n\n This argument makes no sense. Of course we are still using oil. But how does that relate to your idea about a monopoly not lasting? Dependence on a product distributed by several organisations doesn't seem to prove anything about your case.\n In fact, it's just reminded me of a near-monopoly that has lasted some time; OPEC. Though I don't know how to work this into an argument, yet :) as I've got to research their status.\n \nI'm not sure that Microsoft is a competitor of IBM. \n\n \nIBM basically had sales people that helped train employees how to use their equipment. It was quite an operation. With Windows you could train a monkey to use a computer. \n\n Sure, but IBM use Microsoft. They aren't in competition. It's like saying that every Ford car gets Goodyear tyres (that's spelled tires in the USA :)). This doesn't make them competitors. It would if Ford made tyres, or Goodyear made cars.\n \nI agree that monopolies are a product of unrestrained capitalism, which is why I'm not in favour of unrestrained capitalism. It is a system that defeats itself, by destroying competition.\n\n \nYou missed my point: Sometimes innovation can ONLY occur only if prices are increased because of a monopoly. If you try to keep prices permanently down with laws and regulation, we may not see the INNOVATION. Why innovate?\n\n Why? To increase profits.\n \nI have retained my left-leaning feelings (at least as far as economics go) \n\n \nI am far to the left with regards to personal freedom. We have something in common.\n\n Cool. I am, however exceptionally conservative on moral issues -though too often breaking my own rules.\n \nThe only difference is which tier of government these laws live in. They are still guided by laws and regulations. \n\n \nI prefer the local level.\n\n In Australia we are more a centralised government. For instance police aren't at local level, but state and federal. I believe you have local school boards, we don't. In fact, all local governments could be swept out of existence at the whim of a state government. State governments can change local council borders, suspend councils etc. The only reason that they don't do so all the time is because people like their councils (in general) and would tend to punish such a government at the electoral box.\n \nI think though that your proposition that monopolies, if left to themselves will cease to remain long in being is untested. \n\n \nWe will never know because they are broken apart. That is why I brought the IBM example up: Before the suit was settled it became apparent they did not have a monopoly. The suit was just dropped.\n\n I think in general the concentration of power is a bad thing - even for a short while (perhaps in times of war, it might be necessary), and economic power is no exception.\n \n\n There's a very good link site for intellectual property at...\n http://www.iaswww.com/ODP/Society/L...ectual_Property \n\n \nThanks for the discussion Monty. I am afraid this could go on forever. If you want to cut the discussion shorter just answer this one question: If copyrights etc are property, then why shouldn?t people be allowed to keep them forever, or do you advocate that?\n\n You've caught me on the hop! I believe in property protection, but I've not ever thought about how long it should be protected for - it's something I've never thought about. That's what I'll do. If I remember, I'll ask some people at work. A lady I worked with has actually specialised in intellectual property, but she's not responded to my e-mails for some months. I guess I'll see what happens.\n \nAlso, thanks for keeping the discussion civil. It is a pleasure.\n\n Most people wouldn't think so, but it is what I aim to do - exchange ideas. I tend though to fight fire with fire, and you've not been insulting. Your post has now prompted me into thinking about something I've never really considered.",

   "http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/95psa.html\n \n I thought this essay was fairly interesting.\n \n \n *But there are quite a few cases in which patents have been used to suppress innovation (Dunford 1987). Companies may take out a patent, or buy someone else's patent, in order to inhibit others from applying the ideas. For example, from its beginning in 1875, the US company AT&T collected patents in order to ensure its monopoly on telephones. It slowed down the introduction of radio for some 20 years. In a similar fashion, General Electric used control of patents to retard the introduction of fluorescent lights, which were a threat to its market of incandescent lights.\n \n *One of the newest areas to be classified as intellectual property is biological information. US courts have ruled that genetic sequences can be patented, even when the sequences are found \"in nature,\" so long as some artificial means are involved in isolating them. This has led companies to race to take out patents on numerous genetic codes. In some cases, patents have been granted covering all transgenic forms of an entire species, such as soybeans or cotton (Mestel 1994). One consequence is a severe inhibition on research by non-patent holders. Another consequence is that transnational corporations are patenting genetic materials found in Third World plants and animals, so that some Third World peoples actually have to pay to use seeds and other genetic materials that have been freely available to them for centuries (Shiva and Holla-Bhar 1993).\n \n *The potential financial returns from intellectual property are said to provide an incentive for individuals to create. In practice, though, most creators do not actually gain much benefit from intellectual property. Independent inventors are frequently ignored or exploited (Lancaster 1992). When employees of corporations and governments have an idea worth protecting, it is usually copyrighted or patented by the organisation, not the employee. Since intellectual property can be sold, it is usually the rich and powerful who benefit. The rich and powerful, it should be noted, seldom contribute much intellectual labour to the creation of new ideas. Note: Look at Telsa, and Edison...you'll understand.\n \n *A second major argument for intellectual property is that people deserve property rights because of their labour. This brings up the general issue of what people deserve, a topic that has been analysed by philosophers. Their usual conclusions go against what many people think is \"common sense.\" Hettinger says that a fitting reward for labour should be proportionate to the person's effort, the risk taken and moral considerations. This sounds all right--but it is not proportionate to the value of the results of the labour, whether assessed through markets or by other criteria. This is because the value of intellectual work is affected by things not controlled by the worker, including luck and natural talent. Hettinger says \"A person who is born with extraordinary natural talents, or who is extremely lucky, deserves nothing on the basis of these characteristics\" (p. 42).\n \n *Another example is scientific knowledge. Scientists do research and then publish their results. A large fraction of scientific knowledge is public knowledge (Ziman 1968). There are some areas of science that are not public, such as classified military research. It is generally argued that the most dynamic parts of science are those with the least secrecy. Open ideas can be examined, challenged, modified and improved. To turn scientific knowledge into a commodity on the market, as is happening with genetic engineering (Mackenzie et al. 1990; Weiner 1986), arguably inhibits science.\n \n \n *The case of science shows that vigorous intellectual activity is quite possible without intellectual property, and in fact that it may be vigorous precisely because information is not owned. But there are lots of areas that, unlike science, have long operated with intellectual property as a fact of life. What would happen without ownership of information? Many objections spring to mind. Here I'll deal with a few of them.\n \n Plagiarism is a great fear in the minds of many intellectual workers. It is often thought that intellectual property provides a protection against plagiarism. After all, without copyright, why couldn't someone put their name on your essay and publish it? Actually, copyright provides very little protection against plagiarism and is not a good way to deal with it (Stearns 1992).\n \n Plagiarism means using the ideas of others without adequate acknowledgement. There are several types of plagiarism. One is plagiarism of ideas: someone takes your original idea and, using different expression, presents it as their own. Copyright provides no protection at all against this form of plagiarism. Another type of plagiarism is word-for-word plagiarism, where someone takes the words you've written--a book, an essay, a few paragraphs or even just a sentence--and, with or without minor modifications, presents them as their own. This sort of plagiarism is covered by copyright--assuming that you hold the copyright. In many cases, copyright is held by the publisher, not the author. In practice, plagiarism goes on all the time, in various ways and degrees (Broad and Wade 1982; Mallon 1989; Posner 1988), and copyright law is hardly ever used against it. The most effective challenge to plagiarism is not legal action but publicity. At least among authors, plagiarism is widely condemned. To be exposed as a plagiarist is more than sufficient motivation for most writers to take care to avoid it.\n \n *What about all the writers, inventors and others who depend for their livelihood on royalties? First, it should be mentioned that only a very few individuals make enough money from royalties to live on. Most of the rewards from intellectual property go to a few big companies. But the question is still a serious one for those intellectual workers who depend on royalties and other payments related to intellectual property.\n \n The alternative in this case is some reorganisation of the economic system. Intellectual workers could receive a salary, just like most scientists do.\n \n But what about the incentive to create? Without the possibility of wealth and fame, what would stimulate creative individuals to produce works of genius? Actually, most creators and innovators are motivated by their own intrinsic interest, not by rewards. There is a large body of evidence showing, contrary to popular opinion, that rewards actually reduce the quality of work (Kohn 1993). If the goal is better and more creative work, paying creators on a piecework basis, such as through royalties, is counterproductive.",

Many companies require that they acquire some/most rights to a writer efforts, as I'm assuming in those cases. \n \n Regardless, the ideas aren't invalid in face of any actions committed by it's author (even though I would assume there are none). So in the effort to retain some focus, let's stay to the point, and not fixate on it's creator.\n \n Are his points invalid, that is the question? \n \n Generally speaking, I think intellectual rights are taken to an extreme. Given they were limited to a short-term of time, I wouldn't have many or any objections. That isn't the case, and it's undenialable that certain technologies/inventions have been swept under the rug because of it.",

   "Monty, I do think that Real Property and Personal Property should be protected.\n \n But: Intellectual Property is usually protected by civil lawsuits. For instance the RIAA is going after Pirates civilly. Some trademarks are protected using government force, but most are in investigated at first privately. \n \n Can you imagine the government bureaucracy that would be required to go after every music pirate criminally, investigators, prosecutors and such? \n \n This is why I say that patents, trademarks and copyrights are only as good as the money you have to protect them.",

First, it should be mentioned that only a very few individuals make enough money from royalties to live on. Most of the rewards from intellectual property go to a few big companies. But the question is still a serious one for those intellectual workers who depend on royalties and other payments related to intellectual property.\n \n The alternative in this case is some reorganisation of the economic system. Intellectual workers could receive a salary, just like most scientists do.\n But what about the incentive to create? Without the possibility of wealth and fame, what would stimulate creative individuals to produce works of genius? Actually, most creators and innovators are motivated by their own intrinsic interest, not by rewards. There is a large body of evidence showing, contrary to popular opinion, that rewards actually reduce the quality of work (Kohn 1993). If the goal is better and more creative work, paying creators on a piecework basis, such as through royalties, is counterproductive.\n",
