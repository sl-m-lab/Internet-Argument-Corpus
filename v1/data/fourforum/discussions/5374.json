   "I'm wondering why she didn't get an abortion. That would have been much more preferable to this :( \n\n \n From a developmental standpoint for the baby, there would have been no difference in killing the baby right before it exited the birth canal (a 3rd trimester abortion) and killing it right after it exited the birth canal. So I'm having a hard time understanding why you would think it to be preferable for her to have had an abortion. Of course I think they are the same because both what she did AND abortion murders the baby--its the same difference regardless of whether it happens before or after the baby exits the birth canal. But it seems to me that a consistent stance on your part would be to support her actions either way, because either way the mother has had her wish, which seems to be your top priority.

Depending on how far along she is, and what medical issues she has, I can disagree and believe it morally wrong to have an abortion in the 3rd trimester, but still firmly believe that she should not be legally required to continue it. Given how few late-term abortions are actually performed and how few of those few would be for light reasons, I don't consider them too much of an issue.\n \n You should assume I would oppose infantcide because the mother has other methods to remove it from her care without harming either herself or the infant. She does not have this option during the pregnancy. I believe she should not have the right to kill the infant when she can remove it from her care without harming either herself or the infant. I believe she should have the right to kill it when she cannot remove it from inside her body without harming herself.\n \n We are drifting from the point of the thread.",
