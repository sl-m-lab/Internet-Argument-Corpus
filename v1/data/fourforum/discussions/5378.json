   "Seems LA times has realizes that such stuff has been going on for quite some time\n \n \n\n WASHINGTON - Senior Bush administration officials reacted with outrage to a Newsweek report that U.S. interrogators had desecrated the Koran at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility, and the magazine retracted the story last week. But allegations of disrespectful treatment of Islam's holy book are far from rare.\n\n \n \n http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-koran22may22,0,3328867.story",

   "Well, it depends on what you mean exactly. Newsweek reported that an anonymous government official says he read in a report the interrigators were desecrating the Koran. Now, did this nameless official actually see this in some report? Who knows. Are interrigators desicrating the Koran? Given the volume of reports saying yes, I'd guess yes. The thing I don't get is why everyone blew up over the Newsweek report, and not the one in the NY times, or the report the Red Cross made, or any of the others over the last year or so.",
