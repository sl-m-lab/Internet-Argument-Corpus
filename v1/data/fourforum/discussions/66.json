First of all, the bill requires you to buy health insurance. This is unconstitutional. Even so, to pay for the bill and the public option, healthcare premiums will skyrocket to 90%. This is more than anyone can pay. If that is the case then in order to stay within the law, since you must have health insurance they will have to go to the public option which will not be an option anymore because the healthcare insurance companies will all go out of buisiness. Then the public option is the only choice. It is run by the government so everyone will have to accept rationed healthcare. The government tried to run Medicare and Medicaid and failed at that. So they simply cannot run the whole healthcare system if they cannot run Medicare and Medicaid. So it will not be a public option. Now that is out of the bill, then when it is established, people will have to accept that the only option is government run healthcare, or in other words, socialized medicine. emoticon_frazzled",

The word option inmplies a choice. The major choice seems to me to be whether or not you want any coverage. Taking that choice away by fining you hardly makes healthcare \"optional\". emoticon_rolleyes\n \n maybe Uncle Sam should force us all to buy domestic cars and call that \"optional\" as well.",
