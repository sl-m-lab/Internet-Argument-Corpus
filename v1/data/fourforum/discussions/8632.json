Iraqi's were ultimately responsible for Sadam. One is germain to our national defense, the other isn't. Therefore, my response to 9/11 would have been a massive attack on and elimination of anyone belonging to, associated with, tolerating or harboring Al Quaeda. Nation building would never enter in.

They seem to understand that. We don't. Europe certainly doesn't.

Lets take a look at what AQ claims and their goals, and see how much of it is accurate.\n \n AQ wants the removal of the house of Saud, claiming that they are totalitarian tyrants. They largely blame the US for this because they claim that we support them.\n \n 10/10. The house of saud is a bunch of tyrants, and we do support them. In fact, it is highly unlikely that they would be in power today wihtout all the years of US support.\n \n AQ claims that the US is a facilitator of Israel, and therefore bears responsibility for the deaths of over 100,000 palestenian civilains\n \n 10/10. Sorry, they got us there, to. The US has for years blocsked any UNSC resolution that would mandate that israel remove itself from illegally seized land and stop slaughtering civilians. \n \n AQ claims that the we are responsible for the deaths of a million Arabs in the Iran Iraq war, which they claim that we instigated\n \n 8/10 on this one. Iran and Iraq had problems of their own. Whiel we certainly pushed them towards war, and provided Iraq with chemical, biological, and conventional weapons to fight the war, it is likely that there would have been a war, though at a much smaller scale and Iraq probably would have lost, had we not been involved. In all fairness, I don't thin that we are probably actually responsible for more than 800,000 of those deaths.\n \n AQ claims that we are responsible for the deeaths of half a million Iraqis due ot sanctions against Iraq.\n \n 10/10. Yea, we did that one. We could potentially argue about justifications behind the sanctions, but at the end of the day, we refused to even discuss removal or loosening of the sanctions, even after it became apparent that hundreds of thousands were dying, so that one was pretty much our bad. \n \n Thats pretty much it when it comes to the US, though they do want to topple pro western dictatorships in the ME. \n \n Their claims that we are directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Arabs, and the oppression of millions, is right on the money. How many have to die, and how many millions have to be oppressed, before those that we have helped to kill and oppress get the right to strike back? \n \n You have to employ an ENORMOUS amount of doublethink to imagine for one second that our reaction to 9/11 was justifiable, but the actual attack on 9/11 was not. The 9/11 attacks killed a few thousand people and we invaded 2 countries and killed well over 100,000 civilians in retaliation. On the other side, you have millions of dead arabs that we are either fully or partially responsible for, as well as some totalitarian regimes that exist primarily because of our support oppresing millions more, and you want ot claim that they had no grounds upon which to attack us? COME ON. :No logical person could possibly follow that train of thought.",

   "We were a non-democratic country before our revolution against the King of England. I hold sheep responsible for feeling so comfortable in their chains. What level of oppression will you tolerate? \n \n On the second point, you misunderstand my views (and perhaps I didn't state them clearly). The terrorists of Al Quaeda view our citizens as co-responsible for whatever it is that justifies their acts against us. That does not mean that I agree with the terrorists that we as a country have wronged them in any grievous way. I strongly believe that those who died on 9/11 were innocent civilians. Al Quaeda believes that they were not. No one has ever proven to me that we are engaged in anything evil. Can you cite the \"evil aspects of US foreign policy\" that justify the slaughter of our people?\n\n \n The innocent civilian definition is structured by whomever is making the claim to the always emotional public:\n \n 1. Al Qaeda (and the rest of the world) defines the US as a democracy with elected leadership and subsequent policy representing the wishes of the citizenry. Al Qaeda feels unjust acts have been committed by the US against Muslim nations. To Al Qaeda, there are no innocent Americans, civilian or otherwise.\n \n 2. The US invaded and occupied Iraq for a variety of since invalidated reasons, all centered on removing Iraq's leadership. The US did not blame Iraq's civilian population for leadership faults, did in fact declare them oppressed by their leadership. The US has killed many, many thousands of innocent Iraq civilians, to this day kills them, and continues to define their death as collateral damage in the US quest for democracy, not as innocent civilians. \n \n 3. Israeli policy in invading Lebanon is publicly defined as rooting out Hezbollah, yet the civilian population of Lebanon has by far taken the brunt of deaths and it's their infrastructure being destroyed. Israel does not mention innocent civilians in their scorched earth policy; to Israel, the citizens of Lebanon are just as guilty as Hezbollah in denying Israeli real estate policy.\n \n So who's to blame for the death of innocent civilians; the citizens themselves, their support of leadership policy or leadership? \n \n If you're unaware of oppression and deaths resulting from US ME policy over past decades, who in the ME the US supported over those years and for what purposes, you might have your head in the sand or a dangerous to your health habit of believing politicians placed in leadership roles by special interests.",

What you overlook, either through ignorance or by choice is that random bombings of civilians will kill people who voted for and against the present administration. You might kill just as many people who voted for John Kerry (the appeaser) as you do people who voted for the one who's sticking guns up your nose.

We are talking about decades of reprehenisble foreign policy implemented by folks on both sides of the aisle.\n \n \nThe CIA having offices in the WTC is not comparable to firing rockets from residential areas. To my knowledge, there were no weapons being stashed in the WTC, there were no soldiers being housed in the WTC...there is no comparison with the cowardly tactics used by the terrorists to bring collateral damage upon the surroundings. But, of course, this is one of their methods of garnering sympathy from those observing the conflict around the world.\n\n \n You are right, it is alligocal.

The only party here who has shown any tendancy to kill all who do not convert to their ways is the US. We eare running around killing people who do not want to accept American democracy.

We know the rust will come back eventually...we'll just have to scrape it off again when it does. The evil acts are being committed by those who strap bombs to other cowards and send them into society to make a loud, killing statement...and by those who support them...such as yourself.\n\n \n And every time they come back a little stronger.

Anyone can paint Israel as the agressor, just as they can paint the USA as imperialistic. Their paint does not change what is underneath.\n \n No doubt it is a well footnoted article. It is, however biased and unworthy of being the basis of such vile arguments as you support.\n\n \n \n and you accuse me of dishonesty with sources? There are 12 full paragraphs following that explaining the background to that invasion:\n \n \nThat crisis had its roots in two factors: friction at the armistice line, established after the 1948 war between Israel and Egypt, and control over the Suez Canal. Another factor was the withdrawal of the U.S. offer to help finance the High Aswan Dam in upper Egypt, a prized project of the country's new ruler and champion of Arab nationalism, Gamal Abdel Nasser.\n \n Eisenhower and Dulles did not trust Nasser because he tried to steer a neutral course between the United States and the Soviet Union, and they were especially displeased with his recognition of Communist China. The administration first tried to win Nasser over, but when that failed, it tried obsessively to undermine him and worse.(68) The wish to undermine Nasser was important in forging a U.S.-Israeli \"strategic relationship.\" The offer to finance the dam and provide arms (with conditions Nasser could not accept) were the carrots dangled before the charismatic Egyptian. When Nasser turned to the Soviets in September 1955 to purchase arms when he could not buy them from the United States without strings attached, his actions were seized on as proof that he was in the Soviet camp and thus an enemy of the United States.(69) (The events in Iran were not lost on Nasser.)\n \n The United States also had antagonized Nasser in 1955 when it set up the Baghdad Pact (later called the Central Treaty Organization, or CENTO), an alliance of northern tier nations, including Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq (the only Arab country in the alliance). Great Britain was also a member. The United States was not a formal member but was clearly a guiding force. Nasser saw the pact as an attempt to split the Arab world and interfere with the \"positive neutralism\" he sought for it. Iraq at the time was friendly to the West and not disposed to the Arab nationalism that Nasser aspired to create and lead.(70) The Baghdad Pact was one of the things that had the ironic effect of bringing the Arabs and Soviets closer.\n \n In mid-1956 the United States abruptly withdrew its offer to help finance the High Aswan Dam, just as the Egyptians had decided to accept the administration's conditions. The American reversal brought cancellations of aid for the dam from Great Britain and the World Bank as well. A week after the U.S. decision, Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal Company, which since 1869 had been owned by French nationals and the British government and operated under an Egyptian concession. The British and French governments reacted angrily; for the French, it was not irrelevant that Nasser was helping the Algerians, who were seeking independence. The U.S. reaction was calmer, as Eisenhower and Dulles distinguished between ownership and freedom of navigation. (Nevertheless, the New York Times denounced Nasser as \"the Hitler on the Nile.\")(71) The U.S. administration warned Great Britain and France against responding precipitously and pressed for negotiations. A conference was convened, but Nasser refused to attend or accept its pro-posals. Nevertheless, international traffic on the canal continued normally under Egyptian administration. When Great Britain and France failed to get satisfaction from the United Nations, they began making plans for war.\n \n Israel was not able to use the canal, but the Jewish state's aims regarding Egypt went beyond that grievance. Since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, Palestinian refugees had often crossed into Israel seeking to regain property and possessions expropriated by the government and to reach relatives. Some engaged in violence. Israel began responding with massive reprisal raids against entire villages in the Arab countries. Most significant was the attack on the town of Gaza in February 1955, when children as well as men were killed. That attack prompted Egypt to end direct peace talks with Israel and to turn to the Soviet Union for arms. It was only at that point that Egypt sponsored an anti-Israeli guerrilla organization whose members were known as the Fedayeen. In August Israel attacked the Gaza Strip village of Khan Yunis, killing 39 Egyptians. The attacks in the Gaza Strip, masterminded by officials loyal to Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, subverted Nasser's efforts to make peace with Israel. Ben-Gurion's successor, Moshe Sharett, re-sponded positively to Nasser's overtures, but Gen. Moshe Dayan and others undermined Sharett.(72) During the winter of 1955, for example, Israeli warplanes flew over Cairo repeatedly to demonstrate Egyptian military impotence.\n \n The Israeli government had earlier tried to prevent a warming of U.S.-Egyptian relations by having saboteurs bomb American offices in Cairo in 1954, an episode that became known as the Lavon Affair.(73) When Egypt uncovered the operation, Israel accused Nasser of fabricating the plot. Two of the 13 men arrested were hanged, and their hangings were used as a pretext for Israel's February 1955 attack on Gaza. Six years later, the Israeli government's complicity was confirmed.\n \n Israel's bad relations with Egypt were also aggravated by the seizure of an Israeli ship, which was provocatively sent into the Suez Canal in September 1954. Both sides had seized each other's ships before, and this incident appears to have been provoked by Israel as a way to get Great Britain to compel Egypt to permit Israeli ships to use the waterway as part of a final agreement on the Suez Canal.(74)\n \n Despite repeated provocations, Egypt, according to documents later captured by Israel, had attempted to prevent infiltration by the Fedayeen because of its fear of attack.(75) Nevertheless, in October 1956 Israel invaded Egypt, ignoring American pleas for forbearance. The United States took the matter to the UN Security Council, which called for a cease-fire and withdrawal. It also passed a resolution to create a 6,000-man UN emergency force to help restore the status quo ante.\n \n Eisenhower's opposition to the conduct of Israel, Great Britain, and France--an anomaly in light of later U.S. policy--is explained by his opposition to old-style colonialism. The administration wanted to win the friendship of the newly independent countries of Africa and Asia and to keep them out of the Soviet orbit. That could not be accomplished if the United States were perceived to be on the side of Great Britain and France in so flagrant an act of imperialism as an attack on Egypt. Also important to the administration's calculus was its wish that London not challenge Washington's more subtle dominance in the Middle East. British and French irritation with American anti-colonialism was a source of problems among the leaders of the three nations.(76)\n \n When the UN call for a cease-fire failed to contain the conflict, the Soviet Union threatened to intervene, and Premier Nicolai Bulganin even proposed to Eisenhower that their two countries take joint military action to end the war. Eisenhower rejected the proposal and warned the Soviets not to get involved.(77)\n \n The fighting ended on November 7, when Britain and France bowed to the United Nations and agreed to withdraw. Israel, however, refused to withdraw from the Sinai until its conditions were met. Israel was especially adamant that Egypt not regain the Gaza Strip, which was to have been part of the Palestinian state under the UN partition. Eisenhower responded to Israel's position by threatening to cut off aid, although he apparently never did so.(78) By March 1957 Israel had withdrawn from all the occupied areas, but not before the United States had given assurances that UN troops would be stationed on Egyptian territory to ensure free passage of Israeli and Israel-bound ships through the Strait of Tiran and to prevent Fedayeen activity. The United States, in an aide-m\u00c7moire by John Foster Dulles, also acknowledged that the Gulf of Aqaba was international waters and \"that no nation has the right to prevent free and innocent passage in the Gulf and through the Straits.\" The key to the final settlement was a French proposal that Israel be allowed to act in self-defense under the UN charter if its ships were attacked in the Gulf of Aqaba.(79)\n \n Thus, the United States again became directly involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict and made what would later be construed as guarantees to Israel. Although Israel chafed under the frank rhetoric and surprising (in light of the U.S. election season) evenhandedness of Eisenhower and Dulles, it got essentially what it wanted from the Suez campaign.(80\n\n \n Its not like that is even somethign you could have done accidentaly. We are not talking mis citing a course here, or a misunderstanding, we are talking a dozen paragraphs. Almost the entire section on the war. That is just pathetic.",

Shall we blame the Saudis for bin Laden just because he was one?\n \n I can imagine there being numerous reasons for Israel's refraining from attacking Saudi Arabia.\n \n To get a reliable answer to that question, you'll have to ask the Israeli government.\n\n \n Couldn't be that we get 12% of our crude import from the Sauds and elimination of that source would quickly crash us and turn off the Israeli money machine? A forced marriage between Muslims and Jews. \n \n I have no proof of where their (extremist) money comes from, just the common knowledge that Sauds, especially the Royal Family, support the greater portion of Muslim fundamentalist education throughout the Islamic World and as a finance guy would think there would be no better conduit to distribute funding of any type. The Sauds, and many Asian/ME nationals, still use money changers for a lot of their transactions. Untraceable, generally protected by the Pakistan underworld.",

I did find it amusing that you shifted your position at that point from one of \"they don't cost us that much\" to \"they have the right to defend thamselves regardless of cost\", so it is obvious that you DID get the point, and recognized that you were wrong, you just were not man enough to admit it.\n\n \n The proof is in the pudding.\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=8510\n \n \n post #16\n Daewoo claims that a GAO report printed in the year 2000 puts aid to Israel at 1.2 trillioin (as opposed to roughly 90 billion)\n \n Post #25\n Steeeeve asks for a link\n \n Post #31\n Daewoo says he still has his hard copy but can't post a link\n \n Post # 32\n JT calls daewoo's bluff\n \n Post #35\n Daewoo posts links to a 2002 article in the Christian Science Monitor that mentions Stauffer's report of 1.6 trillion dollar cost to the USA (not listed as Aid to Israel but as our cost due to supporting Israel....clearly not comparable to the 90 billion actual aid to Israel that Daewoo claims should be 1.2 trillion (in his original claim of GAO report printed in 2000)\n \n Stauffer's report is dated June 2003 and could not have been referenced in any report by GAO in 2000.\n \n Post #68\n Steeeeve asks for the number of daewoo's GAO report printed in 2000 (a report Daewoo claims to still have in hand)\n \n Post #90\n JT points out that daewoo has ignored Steeeeve's request\n \n Post #91\n Daewoo posts some numbers Order Code 1B85066 and GAO-ID-83-51\n Along with a link to a 1973 article.\n \n There is no link to the GAO report printed in 2000 that Daewoo still claims to hold\n \n \n Post #125\n Daewoo changes his story...reposts links to the Stauffer report and adjusts his 1.2 trillion to 1.6 trillion claiming he must have been right all along. (Just like Dan Rather-the document was fake, but it was accurate! LOL)\n \n Post #131\n Gator figured it out, too.\n \n Post#137\n Daewoo makes another inadequate explanation claiming to have re-read his GAO report printed in 2000 to see that the trillions figure was not in the report but in an analysis of the report.

   "Yes, this is getting old. I think I will just stick ol' Jim on \"ignore\" for a while.\nIt's been old for a while. It should have been nipped in the bud by your admission of and apology for deliberately misleading us as soon as you were challenged. But, no...the great one squirms and spits and fights to the death on an issue that had little to do with the thread topic to begin with.\n \n Ignore all posters that you choose. That doesn't make them wrong anymore than your calling them XXXXXX or fascists makes them either one. What you call me has little effect on how I feel about myself.\n \n And don't forget, Mommy still loves you.emoticon_xhoho",
