   "Another example of a hollywood star turning against his country, spouting nonsense while not having a clue as to what is really going on in the world.\n\n \n Well I don't know that he is trying to say that he is against our country. He does fear what we do sometimes though. I've have heard plenty of voices of opposition against the war in Iraq and I'll admit that I think it was starting to get out of hand there. If Bush were to draw us into another war, perhaps with North Korea or perhaps with Syria or Iran without the UN support, then I'd be agreeing a lot with what Depp is saying. We did go off on our own and pretend like the rest of the worlds opinion didn't matter and that we were going to do whatever it is we wanted to do.\n \n This is how we are coming off to the rest of the world as well. The Iraq war could have been justified if we found more proof of WMDs and if it had gone smoother after the war ended. Instead we have shown our intelligence is incapable of providing the right information and that our leaders didn't really know what to expect after the war ended. I think this show of force along with the errors that have occurred will scare some people, even US citizens.\n \n I don't really hold what Depp is saying against him. He is voting with his feet right now and is staying in France. That is fine with me. I don't think a lot of US citizens want to make that drastic of a step but I don't hold it against them if they choose to do so. It is a peaceful way of showing disapproval although I bet the fans of Depp may not be too pleased with some of the statements that he has made publicly.",

I have found what Depp said was taken severely out of context. I support you on pointing out how some of are actors have been unpatriotic by saying terrible things about our President and our country, but I think you should make sure the stuff is exactly true first.
