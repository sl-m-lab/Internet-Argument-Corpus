   "As US tax revenues decrease while our trade imbalance and aggression increase, deficits will continue to expand.\n\n \n It is the increase in agression that bothers me, since it is likely to mean the difference between a steady decline fo the dollar and the dollar falling off a cliff.\n \n \nI don't know about the Yuan. If China does unpeg it, it will be to benefit the Yuan and further devalue the dollar. \n \n \n Of course. The chinese are to be commended for their conservative fiscal policy. It seems likely that they (the chinese) will allow another 10% depreciation of the dollar before doing anything at all. Currently, most estimate that the yuan is 40-60% undervalued (40% is more likely). With a 10% devaluation of the dollar, the yuan would be heading for the 60% mark. Either unpegging, or adjuting the peg (statements out of china keep containing the phrase \"basket of currencies\") would put China in about as good a poition as they could hope for. It has been suggested (most notably by the Japanese) that if the chinese allow the yuan to be undervalued by more than 50%, that the rest of the world could adjust the value indirectly. Not such a rosy picture for the chinese then, but most of the world would have to be onboard, which I don't see as very likely until the yuan reaches the 60% undervalued mark.\n \n \n \nIran, Libya, Venezuela, Russia, Indonesia, and Malaysia all now trade oil in Euros. Saudi Arabia has a 'deal' with the US to stay with dollars, but prudence would make them stray from that with other customers. Canada has little choice, at this time. Iraq is still below pre-invasion production, but when the dust settles, will probably side with Iran. \n \n \n It appears that Canda might soon be onboard as far as accepting alternate currencies for oil. Currently, almost all of Canadas oil goes to the US. The chinese seem to be dealing to not only take roughly 1/3 of candas oil, but also to to fund a significant portion of future expansion in candas oil industry.\n \n This will be a MAJOR problem in the US, since currently our oil from canda is relatively cheap, since we are their only major buyer. If pressure is put on the system by the chinese buyinmg up a third of candas oil, our prce for that oil will almost certainly rise. \n \n \nI'd think it difficult for any competent finance minister to stay with dollars as currency reserves unless the US was offsetting the devaluation with trade loan guarantees as a condition to retain dollar reserves.

Completely shedding themselves of dollars will take some time and continue to beat up the dollar badly. Another 40% wouldn't surprise me. Especially with Bush continually rattling the saber at seemingly everyone as our economic circumstances become less defined.\n\n \n I would have to partially disagree as far as the Pound is concerned. While in the short term it seems to be a good investment, I think it is a dying currency. Regardless of what kind of economic data comes out of England, the Pound shows little motion independant of the Euro. It does, however, respond (though not independantly) to EU trade data. \n \n I think that the problem is in the US financial world, GB is widely viewed as the EU's bitch, so the pound is assumed to follow the Euro. In Europe, though, GB seems to be widely viewed as the Americans westernmost state, and the Euro is percieved as propping up the pound. \n \n Most brokerage houses are already trading the pound as a secondary currency, complete with the wider spread.\n \n I think the interesting thing will be to see how GB responds overall as far as the deteriorating economic position of the US. It has become apparent that they are trying to re-aling themselves with the EU, but after years of being so closely tied to the US, I don't know if they will be able to pull that one off, especially after backing us in our assenine \"War on terror\" to the objection of so many major european players.",

   "Many people feel our invasion of Iraq was predicated on Saddam being the first OPEC producer to trade oil only for Euros. If one looks at those opposed to our invasion of Iraq, all were Euro supporters. Those who supported the invasion had dollar interests. I agree with that and that the 'War on Terror' will never truly be finished, as stated by Bush himself. This allows the US government to protect the US dollar wherever it may be threatened, under the guise of terrorism for legitimacy and public support. \n \n Most of Europe, with non-EU members scrambling to join, Asia other than Taiwan and OPEC producers have sided with the Euro, making Bush look like the fool he is with his 'spreading democracy' crusades on borrowed money. To declare the US will defend Taiwan, a dollar supporter, against China was bravado even the Taiwanese don't believe. Europe, including Russia, is backing Bush into a corner with Iran. His claims of nuclear threat are falling on deaf ears. He has no cards other than the threat of attack, or attack by Israel with the US attempting to pick up the pieces and that, IMO, with our current deficit levels, would crash the dollar. Every nation in the world would unload them at once, instead of the slow change we're now experiencing that provides a cushion for our decline.",

I think it has been killing them to be sitting on all those natural resources and a pool of well educated and labor, and still be more or less stuck as a second (or third, depending on how one wishes to percieve things) nation. \n \n When one consideres just the vast amount of natural resources that canda has to offer, their per capita GDP dwarfing that of the US is not merely a flight of fancy, IF they can develop non us markets for their goods. for a lot of years, the candains have depended almost entirely on US markets for their exports. anytime you only have one customer, that customer is going to set the rules, and they are never going to be in your favor.\n \n With the chinese apparently taking an active interest in canadas natural resources, and the probability of a consumption rate that will probably nearly rival that of the US in the future, I think the days of ultra cheap raw materials from canda, including oil, are coming to an end.",

Asia buys most US debt, which puts them into a quandary of leaving USD reserves too quickly, flooding the market and losing sizable chunks of their reserve portfolios with USD devaluation. I read predictions of Asia establishing a viable bond market by 2010, which would divert their conversion of high rates of personal savings from US debt purchases to internal bond issues. That won't happen until they've shed enough dollars to reduce USD devaluation portfolio impact, but it will happen.\n \n The thought of a stable Asian bond market capturing that growth versus the USD has to make finance ministers tingle with anticipated glee. \n \n I wonder what the Sauds are doing with their usual flood of USD?

While a wholesale shift of Canada's trade to China would cause very strained relations with the US a gradual shift as the Chinese economy grows the US will be hard pressed afford economic retaliation. Besides which as long as commodity prices remains relatively high, Canada can still make lots of money.\n \n Canada has not really courted other countries for trade, for economic efficiency reasons, and a lack of other markets. Canada's exports naturally would go to the US due to transportation reasons, shipping something 1000-3000 miles is less costly then transoceanic shipping. This was a relationship built over the last 50 years or so and would be hard to change. Then of course there is the FTA in which a clause states that Canada has to maintain a proportional amount of exports to the US for natural resouces.\n \n During the 50's and early 60's Canada was a very wealthy nation (excluding Alberta) and up to the mid to late 70's Canada'a GDP per person was pretty much on par with the US. Reagonomics and some poor Canadian governmental economic/social policies changed this for the last 25 years. If Canada can keep away the Neo liberal economic policies that the US is following and Latin America followed during the 90's I believe Canada will maintain its industrial base.

   "Canada's recent trade mission to China, 376 delegates including Canada's international trade minister, resulted in over 100 trade agreements being signed during the visit, almost unheard of in US trade exchanges, where lawyers always get the first, second, middle and last words, and they work on hourly rates. \n \n One of the many conditions China presents to foreign companies desiring to export to China or joint-venture within China is length of commitment. Anything under a 10-year commitment, incidentally the favored and adhered to Chinese economic planning span, faces a formidable tax structure that quickly eliminates fast-buck artists and under-capitalized entities. Once that commitment is accepted and agreed upon, layers of taxes magically disappear and incentives appear. \n \n China is looking at the long haul, holding all the cards, and ties everything together in a rational manner that facilitates superior planning and execution. Let's not forget China made it a point to educate their best minds in the cream of European, Russian and US universities when foreign exchange was very scarce and dear to China.\n \n One of the major reasons US corporations were the last on the boat with trade and manufacturing within China, with many still waiting at the dock, was our traditional short-term political and business planning. The USD has been in decline for 30-years, with the past three approaching near panic stages due to current administration fiscal policies. IMO the emergence of the Euro, with multi-faceted national economy strength as an alternative currency reserve to the fading USD, provided an opportunity for ailing major US corporations to make those long-term commitments required for doing business with China and begin the process of moving assets away from the USD. \n \n I'd think Canadian businesses, the large, smart ones, are also using the USD's demise to relocate performing assets and capital investments away from eventual pure USD trade. While oil and other natural resources are so immensely profitable that absorbing a 30% loss on exchange rates can still be managed with hedges, food producers and other consumer industries have to be seeing the writing on the wall. \n \n Becoming uncompetitive due to currency differences sounds like whining because those managers are tied to USD trade. The lazy ones will fail, while visionaries understand changing markets is the solution. US industry is now so far behind the curve in manufacturing ability with no capital spending on technology and equipment improvements for years that US competition isn't and won't be a factor. Unless one is restricted to trading in US dollars.",
