   "Think about it. Each one of them has there own little job that they do, never doing anything else, in fact one time they all switched jobs and failed at them, thus showing that you should stick to the job you have and not try another. There is no \"consumer smurf\" buying farmer smurfs food, but the food is shared equally. In one episode one of the smurfs (I forget which one found a coin and it tore all the smurfs apart until papa smurf decided to have it be shared between all the smurfs. and Gargamell, the smurfs enemy, is a stereotypical capitalist, wanting to earn money and not caring who he has to kill to do it. in this case by boiling smurfs into gold. also if you think about the smurfs long enough, you realize its an acronym. socialist men under red father, and that is just what papa smurf is, a red father (papa smurf is the only one who has red on). so next time you watch the smurfs, remember, you're supporting the reds.",

   "One thing that is true about communism is that it doesn't work on a large scale. However it works very well on a small scale and is employed all over the US. I discovered this after I thought about the job of a typical computer programmer. In our jobs we have one unquestioned leader and many other leaders below him who we report to. The office supplied are shared equally and everyone has their own specific job to do. A BIG one is the fact that people get paid the same week in and week out regardless of how hard or little they work.\n \n There are obviously some capitalist traits in work as well including supply and demand. The greater the demand for a particular job to get done the greater the supply of work done will be made to be in order to succeed there.\n \n Still I think that the average job is far more based on communist ideals than capitalist ones. Communism is simplicity while capitalism is far too complicated to perform on a small scale. It is when communism is employed in large groups that it fails and I don't think the Smurfs are a very large group at all.",
