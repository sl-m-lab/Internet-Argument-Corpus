   "Interent censorship is something that is both possible and impossible at the same time. The reason for that is that technology's goal is to solve problems, but when a technology creates problems, another techology comes around to fix its problems. So, if we make a system to ban something on the internet, someone can and will make a system that nulls that affect becuase as its acevhing one goal, its happering another.\n \n Where or not it should be allowed in schools or libraries is where it become more tricky. In a library there is a simple solution that does not cost the library anything, require all people under 18 (or what ever the adult age is) to have their parent vouch for them, and if they are under 16, there parent must use the computer with them at the same time, nothing better then the parent controling it. However, In schools, where the parents cant be there, some filtering may be needed. However, when a student has to do leig research, it can be a pain. As one progresses up the grades, it should not have as much filtering, becuase a highschool student may need to research the working of reporductive system or a given relgean that would be blocked a filter. The problem with filtering software is that its list driven or keyword driven. In either case, the school has limited if any control over what does and doesnt make it though the filters.\n \n And just graduating from high school within the last few years, the students know more about the computers than the teachers, therfor keeping the students from disabling the software impossible. just look at http://www.peacefire.org/ to see all the short comings of filters, and with the youth knowing computers better, it could be just as easy as typing msconfig.exe in the run, and removing it from start up.",

On the other hand however censorship can be considered a violation of the First amendmant right? but not everyone wants those things on the internet so it also infringes on THIER rights to have acsess to information with no bias and related such. Censorship is the people in power exerting that power to restain the public opionions and views. These people like me try to get absic and helpful information the governmnet disagrees with out there and get blacklisted. I dont like getting porn online but i have enough sense to narrow my searches. A solution that is not censoring would be to have pornograpich sites end in a .xxx so that the user knows what it is, people may decide that they want to filter out such sites but that isnt censorship. it is denying information acess to themselves. :xcensored see what our governmnet would do? if i were to say something they didnt like :xcensored thats all they say.

   "Schools are very good at locking things. Any controls are locked and installation controls are also locked at my school. Breaking the filter is impossible without a password to shut it off for a few minutes, and attempting to guess that password or alter controls/ settings is a suspendable offense.\n\n Schools are good at locking things most people know about, but when you have a kid that knows more about the computer than the teacher, it's amazing how many loopholes are left open. At my school, Command Prompt, Registry Editor, and some IP settings are accessible. It would be incredibly easy to corrupt files in the hard-drive or cancel virus protection. Bypassing filters isn't incredibly hard either, although doing it without anyone noticing... I don't no anyone who's done that. But the point is, school computers are not as safe as most of the staff at a school think. Most search engines are also have preferences that can be set. It's not hard for someone to set something like Yahoo to permit all web content. Then it's left up to the filter alone.\n \n For Internet censorhip, it depends on how things are censored. If you watch censored media, such as a TV show with a lot of swearing, certain words aer bleeed out, but in most cases it's increidibly easy to figure out waht was being said. Internet censorhip would be more strict, in that a set of sites would be completely blocked. It makes sense in some ways, and it's a bad idea in others.\n \n \nSchools are very good at locking things. Any controls are locked and installation controls are also locked at my school. Breaking the filter is impossible without a password to shut it off for a few minutes, and attempting to guess that password or alter controls/ settings is a suspendable offense.\n\n That's a very good example. The filter on the computers is blocking something against the government that runs the country, and it is blocked out by the filter. That should not be allowed, it's part of human history and censoring history is similar to editting history to make it seem like something else happened. People are kept ignorant and don't understand what foreign countries attempted to accomplish in hostory too well.\n \n On the other hand, you have to figure out what should be blocked. Pure pornography is something most people would object to being permitted in a school. However, an option like this\n \nImagine if sites with pornographic content ended in \".xxx\" rather than \".com\", or \".net\" and then imagine if Netscape and Internet Explorer could block out all sites that had \".xxx\" in their addresses.\n is not something many pornographic websites would comply to. it would be much easier to steal the site than to move it, which is a scary thought.\n \n The best solution is really what's happeneing now. Websites are set into categories for their content and then that information is kept in the filters. That should be done differently though. Most pictures showing diagrams of reproductive systems or something similar would be in science related websites. Those should be excluded from lists of sites which should be blocked. They're educational, so it's stupid to block them (unless it really is just showing off porn with no educational content). With that though, most pictures of reproductive systems would be drawings, so perhaps scientific drawings would be excluded from filter lists.\n \n I can think of two things at the top of my head that would make accurate filtering very difficult, and would have to be resolved somehow.\n \n 1. 1337 (pronounced leet). Most people on the internet are at least vaguely aware of 1337, that is, replacing letters with combinations of numerals and similar letters. (\"I have awesome websites\" would be written as something like \"1 h4ve 1337 w3bs1tz0rs\") If URLs are written this way for certain types of sites, they'd be incredibly difficult to filter because there are so many variations of 1337, some specific to particular computer games and forums. If you have people finding information on sites with questionable content, it would be very helpful if some of them were able to read and interpret 1337 easily. That way they could search for similar types of sites with similar URLs much easier.\n \n That leads into the second problem though.\n \n 2. 'Google bots.' Google doesn't have a huge team of people searching over sites for content and keywords that may hint at specific kinds of sites. That's done by series of computers known usually as Google bots. These are what find information for search engines and add them to their huge database of websites that can show up in a search. The problem is that these run by keywords. if you have a pornographic picture labeled \"Day_at_the_beach.JPG,\" only a person is going to realize that it's a pornographic picture. The Google bot will not assign it to be blocked when blocking preferences are set. 1337 is also a problem with Google bots. You can't expect a computer to recognize \"p0rn0_p1ctur3z.JPG\" as something that should be blocked. It's best to keep as many people in the loop as possible.\n \n It must also be remembered that Google bots can make mistakes and set s scientific or innocent image or web page to be blocked. Also, keeping as many people as possible trying to sort through what's not allowed and what's not would take up a lot of time; and strict rules on how to classify if something as innapropriate or violent would have to be enforced. Things such as communist realted sites may be blocked by some people and not others. I suppose it'd be best for the filters to be very customiable from the host computer, but untouchable by the other computers on the netowrk. Don't make it require any software on the student used computers (most filters do this now), and have a huge array of options to be chosen. All that really has to be done is to decide what is permittable to what age groups (customiable to each account perhaps) and what should be allowed by research. A website saying why the US should be destroyed and Communist should reign is not somthing a 9 year old should be reading, because they'd be too ignorant on the subject to understand that there would be many other points of view. Someone older perhaps would understand, and would most likely be looking at the site for research purposes.\n \n Therefore, Internet censorship makes sense, but on a very basic level. School should have some choice, but certain things should be permitted, and things like pure pornography should not be allowed to be viewable by a 9 year old. Also, trying to keep aprents on watch as well would be helpful. Having parents being urged to report sites that have questionable content to Google or a filter is good, and then that company can decide whether it is worth blocking. Most of it is built on opinions of what is acceptable though, so a basic standard of what's not allowed and what is would haev to be set in the beginning.",
