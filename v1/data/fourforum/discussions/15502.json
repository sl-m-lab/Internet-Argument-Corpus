   "Who said gay people in general were responsible for child molesters? If that was said, it was probably by one poster on here in particular.\n\n \n are you suggesting that certain gay people are responsible for child molestation? Or that perhaps homosexuality as a whole is responsible? In which case that's just as bad. I trust that you are honest when you say you're just as peeved about WBC that we all are, and they definitely don't represent religion or religious believers as a whole. This church is an extreme exception and I imagine atheists aren't the only ones who despise them - but religious people as well.\n \n Anyways, if the whole 19 minutes of this video didn't put you into a fit of hysteria, clutching your knees, rocking back and forth whilst also pulling out the majority of your hair, you must therefore be a member of the WBC.\n \n Middle woman - \"SHES TLAKING DONT INTERUP HER!!!\"\n TF - \"Well, the thing about that is...\"\n Middle woman - \"SHUTUP IDIOT YOUR RONG!!!\"\n \n Quite a funny video, but extremely difficult to watch.

My first question would have been \"Why did you agree to do this interview?\"\n\n \n More than anything, the belligerence of the woman in the middle was overwhelming. However, as offensive and belligerent as she was, ironically the woman was correct at the end with her response to the guy's argument regarding Luke 17:34. That was a terrible argument he was making.",

There is no one to \"curb their behavior from within\". Christianity is not some nebulous organized group that can reign in these fringe people. Just like there's no central organization of atheism that could reign in a single group of atheists. Your comment makes no sense. I suppose if they were part of the Roman Catholic church or some other denomination, they could be kicked out of that particular denomination, but they aren't. \n \n As a Christian I certainly don't take their support for any agenda, as I don't hold to their agenda. But I don't have any control over them, nor does anyone else. As far as I'm concerned they are too far removed from the teachings and emphasis of Christ for me to consider them Christian, but that's just my opinion.",
