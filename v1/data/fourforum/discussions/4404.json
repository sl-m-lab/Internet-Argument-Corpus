   "This last week, there was a major meeting in Ireland of the Anglican church clergy in which the problem of North American churches allowing practicing homosexuals as priests was addressed.\n \n It seems that the Anglican church is finally taking a stand here, and rightly deciding that biblical scripture, rather than political correctness, should guide the church as it always has.\n \n Here are the pertinent exerpts from the Communiqu\u00e9 regarding the meeting:\n 6. We then proceeded to our own reflections on these responses. There are a number of things which are quite clear. Many primates have been deeply alarmed that the standard of Christian teaching on matters of human sexuality expressed in the 1998 Lambeth Resolution 1.10, which should command respect as the position overwhelmingly adopted by the bishops of the Anglican Communion, has been seriously undermined by the recent developments in North America. At the same time, it is acknowledged that these developments within the Episcopal Church (USA) and the Anglican Church of Canada have proceeded entirely in accordance with their constitutional processes and requirements (vi). We also wish to make it quite clear that in our discussion and assessment of the moral appropriateness of specific human behaviours, we continue unreservedly to be committed to the pastoral support and care of homosexual people. The victimisation or diminishment of human beings whose affections happen to be ordered towards people of the same sex is anathema to us. We assure homosexual people that they are children of God, loved and valued by him, and deserving of the best we can give of pastoral care and friendship (vii). \n \n 12. We as a body continue to address the situations which have arisen in North America with the utmost seriousness. Whilst there remains a very real question about whether the North American churches are willing to accept the same teaching on matters of sexual morality as is generally accepted elsewhere in the Communion, the underlying reality of our communion in God the Holy Trinity is obscured, and the effectiveness of our common mission severely hindered.\n \n 13. We are persuaded however that in order for the recommendations of the Windsor Report to be properly addressed, time needs to be given to the Episcopal Church (USA) and to the Anglican Church of Canada for consideration of these recommendations according to their constitutional processes.\n \n 14. Within the ambit of the issues discussed in the Windsor Report and in order to recognise the integrity of all parties, we request that the Episcopal Church (USA) and the Anglican Church of Canada voluntarily withdraw their members from the Anglican Consultative Council for the period leading up to the next Lambeth Conference. During that same period we request that both churches respond through their relevant constitutional bodies to the questions specifically addressed to them in the Windsor Report as they consider their place within the Anglican Communion. (cf. paragraph 8)\n \n 18. In the meantime, we ask our fellow primates to use their best influence to persuade their brothers and sisters to exercise a moratorium on public Rites of Blessing for Same-sex unions and on the consecration of any bishop living in a sexual relationship outside Christian marriage. \n \n 19. These strategies are intended to restore the full trust of our bonds of affection across the Communion.\n Asking the members of the U.S. and Canadian Episcopalian churches to withdraw is a definite and strong step. I believe it is the correct one. The Episcopal church is going to have to decide whether scripture will be it's guide, or social issues. It is ironic to see that in this case, the international community (of Anglicans) are actually the ones taking the liberal U.S. church to task. At the same time, it is encouraging. Hopefully the North American churches involved will repent. If not, the worldwide Angican church is probably better off without them, and to let them go their own way where they will probably fade into a effectiveless group with no meaningful doctrine as so many other hyper-liberal 'religious' groups have. Gay activism is pretty much free to do as they want, but trying to destroy the church is not aceptable. There is no excuse to have driven this rift into the church the way it has.\n \n The entire communiqu\u00e9 can be read here: http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/articles/39/00/acns3948.cfm",

There is no excuse to have driven this rift into the church the way it has.\n\n \n This is a horrible thing to say. A set of people exists with a different set of beliefs about what the Bible says. These people believe that the Bible is about treating others well and helping, not harming, and they believe that same-sex marriage is helpful to millions. They try to practice and promote what they believe the Bible says, and they are accused of trying to destroy the church? Not only that, but you would accuse \"gay rights activists\" in general of doing this?\n \n Such claims are unfounded attacks on people who are trying to help others. Those in the church who support same-sex marriage are trying to strengthen the church by pushing it toward supporting that which they believe the Bible truly says. They may further be strenghtening the church because its perceived intolerance and hatred are a big reason why so many people today are rejecting its teachings. But the second these people question that which Christian leaders claim the Bible says, it is claimed that they are trying to destroy the church? Christian leaders are just men.\n \n Furthermore, the vast majority of gay rights activists are not targetting churches, they are targetting political rights. Although some members of the church may feel that their religious leaders are mistreating others, it is completely unfair to blanket \"gay rights activists\" as trying to destroy the church. I might as well claim that \"gay rights opponents are murdering homosexuals\". Such a claim might be true of a few, but the vast majority do not murder homosexuals. Gay rights activists are destroying the church in the same degree that gay rights opponents are committing murder.\n \n As for the article, the church is free to do as it pleases among its members, but it should not be free to deny the legal right of marriage to same-sex couples.",

I would find it acceptable to state that the gay pride movement has resulted in some religious people questioning the values of their own religion and trying to change that religion.\n \n Regardless, I think your argument is based on the idea that it is somehow more honest to believe as traditionally accepted, but I could not agree less. If you believe that your church is misinterpreting something, it is not honest to abandon them and start your own religion; it is more honest to try to work with your religion to resolve this possible misinterpretation.

I do not fault them for that, and I cannot even fault leaders of churches for supporting an issue that they feel is right, even if I prefer they'd focus more on worship. But I can fault them for harming people, and I believe denying legalization of same-sex marriage does just that.\n \n \nI think they are targeting anything they can, church OR govt.\n\n \n An interest group will try to build support any way it can because its members believe they are doing the greater good.

Division can be healthy when it results in the discussion of and solution to a problem. Breaking the rules to do this may not have been the nicest idea, but it was probably the most effective at getting this issue to at least be considered.\n \n \nFor the most part I agree, but this is definitely an exception (the Episcopal church).\n\n \n Right, good, yes.

But a private organization, I think, is differnet from a religion. It isn't as easy to break away from one's religion, to sever all ties from that which one has been a part of for so long. In the case of creating a new organization, those who were not allowed in to this sort of exclusive club decided to create their own, non-exclusive club. In the case of religion, those who have long been part of a deep-rooted belief system find themselves disagreeing with a single, small belief held by some others in the organization. It is not as simple to toss everything you've considered good aside; it is better to present that which you think is broken and see if the group will agree that it needs to be fixed.\n \n \nOr they genuinely believe it is the right belief and best for the church, which in fact is probably the most common reason.\n\n \n Well, yes, I suppose I worded that poorly.

Yes, the Anglican body is changing to fit new knowledge and new understandings of reality, MUCH more so than the Roman Catholic Church. I don't think that is a bad thing at all. And no, I do not expound my beliefs to the church.\n \n \n \n \n \nIf they were trying to help, they would move on and found their own denomination, rather than stubbornly continuing what they are doing, knowing full well it is tearing the church apart. That's not helping at all.\n\n \n Isn't that exactly the what the Anglican church did; split from the Roman Catholic Church?\n \n \n \n \nActually, church attendance and membership is as high as ever, worldwide.\n\n \n I would be interested in seeing the source of your claim. I recently found a study which shows those who \"claim\" to attend church (all religions considered) was at 20%, with the actual figure believed to be lower.\n \n \nI will say this though, the church does not need to be about the business of activism whether for OR against gay priests. It has been the strongest when they have been about the business of worship and humanitarian issues.\n\n \n I guess you don't comsider gay rights to be a humanitarian issue?\n \n \nOnly speaking for myself, if I want activism, I can get that at a political rally or joining a special interest group.\n\n \n Oh, come off it, jyoshu! You are one of the most \"activist\" anti-gay people here!!!!!!!!!!!!\n \n \nIf I want to worship, a church would be my choice. For instance, if the religious right put half as much effort these days into helping victims of poverty, AIDS, and other worldwide problems as they do hot-button political issues, the world AND the church would be a lot better off. But activism in the church has also been embraced by liberal groups, in this case the American and Canadian Episcopalians pushing the view of gay priests.\n\n \n I suppose you don't consider the antics of Jerry Falwell, Focus on the Family, et. al., as activism?\n \n \n \n \nI think they are targeting anything they can, church OR govt.\n\n \n Which \"they\"? The liberals or the conservatives? What do you call the president's pushing conservative religious agenda on the US?",

Regardless of religion, they simply view the institution as too sacred to tamper with. (You won't agree I'm sure, but that doesn't change the fact that many people view it that way.) One doesn't have to be particularly religious to have such a view of marriage. And statements by some psychological organizations such as the APA (which do not constitute \"the entire medical and psychological community\" as some here have suggested) haven't helped that much either--they've been wrong before on other things. And if one reads the statements carefully, they are not tacit approval of homosexuality, but rather indicate that the organization takes the stance (in general--doesn't mean all it's members) that homosexuality does not amount to mental illness and that they can generally raise children without harmful effects to the children. I have no problems with any of that, but it doesn't have much bearing on whether marriage as an institution should be redefined.

But because the gay lobby insists on it by only wanting marriage as a criteria to get these benefits, it becomes glaringly clear that it is not so much 'rights' that you all are seeking, but validation and social acceptance.

   "FALLACY ALERT\n \n Begging the Question\n \n\n \n That is not Begging the Question if it can be shown that gay people are denied equality. Regarding equality, the definition might be agreed upon as access to an equivalent set of rights and benefits under the law. In a quick inspection, it would appear that everyone has the same rights and this would imply that everyone has equal rights. But a more detailed inspection reveals that the right to marriage is both designed for and put into use to grant benefits specifically to those who engage in heterosexual relationships. This same set of benefits does not currently exist for those who engage in homosexual relationships. It stands to reason then, that in order to recieve the benefits of marriage, a homosexual man must change his beliefs, behavior, and person he has fallen in love with. A heterosexual man must do nothing. My conclusion is that access to the same set of rights is not the same thing as access to an equal set of rights.\n \n As an example, I might provide benefits for people who worship at a Buddhist church. Although everyone has the same access to these benefits, the benefits are not equal. Christians would need to change their religion, their way of life, everything they believe in so that they could get these benefits.\n \n Further consideration makes it certain that it is the criteria one must meet in order to qualify for these benefits that makes them unequal. When the criteria says, \"By the way, you must give up your homosexual relationship and engage in a heterosexual relationship to qualify,\" then inequality could be no more clear.",
