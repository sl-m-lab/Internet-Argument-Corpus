   "From the UK's Times Online.\n \n   Gun sales shoot up amid America's fear of rising crime and terrorism \n Smith & Wesson, the famed American gunmaker once owned by Tomkins, the British conglomerate, expects to nearly double its annual sales in the next three to five years as demand for its firearms soars in the recession. It is not alone.\n All over America demand for firearms and ammunition is rising amid concerns that rising unemployment, which passed 10 per cent this month, will lead inexorably to higher rates of crime. Fears of terrorism have also helped to lift demand, as have concerns among gun owners that the Obama Administration may introduce restrictions on gun ownership and impose additional taxes.\n .....\n \"People are worried about personal protection with unemployment and crime on the rise,\" he said in a presentation to investors, adding that 30 per cent of customers who had bought the company's guns in the first half of this year were \"first-time gun owners\", up from 9 per cent nine a year earlier.\n\n \n I know the Left thinks this is just an example of delusional paranoia, but allow me to add some incite! (Not that I, or we, care about what you think is driving this increased sales, because it is really None of Your Business! emoticon_smile) \n \n However, I have a very liberal friend who often talked of his concern about people he didn't want to be armed. However, back when the Brady Bill requiring background checks was passed, and before it's implementation, he purchased a 357 Magnum handgun with some of the nastiest hollow points that were on the market! When I asked him why, he told me that he didn't want the government to know what he owned. It simply was none of their business, because they work for us! It is not the other way around! (I liked that saying so much I stole it from him and you have seen it used several times here now.) emoticon_smile \n \n The above is the REAL answer to the question of why this is happening now! And there is NOTHING you on the Left can do about it either! emoticon_smile !!!!!!!!!!!\n \n   Total NICS Firearm Background Checks November 30, 1998 - October 31, 2009 \n Total = 106,613,974\n",

We're all familiar with the fact that the justice system is basically a revolving door. Unless there's been a truly heinous crime committed, nearly all cases end in a plea bargain that results in convictions for reduced charges. The DOJ has reported that one million gang members are responsible for 80% of all crimes committed in America for any given year.\n \n We have gun traffickers that should be locked up for the rest of their lives under current guidelines, they're allowed to walk if they roll on their clientele, leaving them free to traffic again. We've got murderers being given probation. We've got violent gangs that the police won't even touch because it'll spark lawsuits of racism and discrimination.\n \n It's not the gun laws in America that are the problem. It's everything else.\n \n \nAmerica already has a higher incarceration rate than other developed nations.\n\n \n Irrelevant. Incarceration rates don't measure the differences in sentences.

America already has a higher incarceration rate than other developed nations. Gun activists keep telling us we need to lock more people up and keep them locked up for longer. If that's the standard by which criminal justice systems can be evaluated then America is doing a better job. So how can the difference in murder rates be blamed on America's criminal justice system?\n\n \n Seventy percent of violent felons had a prior arrest \n record, and 57% had at least one prior arrest for a \n felony. Sixty-seven percent of murderers and 73% of \n those convicted of robbery or assault had an arrest \n record.\n Convicted violent felons are among the most serious \n offenders in the criminal justice system. They are \n convicted of violent offenses, such as murder, rape, \n robbery, and assault, and given the most severe \n sanctions. A BJS analysis of felony convictions in \n the 75 most populous counties found that a majority \n of those committing violent felonies had--\n \n * multiple prior arrests\n \n * at least 1 prior felony arrest\n \n * at least 1 prior conviction.\n \n Additionally, the analyses found that most convicted \n violent felons were -- \n \n * detained from arrest through conviction\n \n * sentenced to incarceration upon conviction\n \n * sentenced to a prison term of 10 years or more if \n convicted of murder or rape.\n \n These findings are based on data from the BJS State \n Court Processing Statistics (SCPS) program. The multi-\n year SCPS dataset includes a sample of felony cases \n filed during selected months in the 75 largest counties \n from 1990 through 2002. About half of all reported\n violent crimes nationwide occur in these counties. \n In 2002 these counties accounted for --\n \n * 61% of robberies\n \n * 51% of murders and non-negligent manslaughters\n \n * 47% of aggravated assaults \n \n * 36% of forcible rapes.\n \n This report presents data on approximately 9,000\n http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/ascii/vfluc.txt\n \n Police Arrest Man In 1999 Murder Case\n Suspect Previously Convicted Of Murder\n Ex-soldier, with prior murder conviction, arrested for 1999 murder : DMZ Hawai&#039;i / Aloha &#039;Aina\n \n I know of no truly comprehensive data on this, but here's what we learn from the intentional homicide line in Justice Department's Felony Defendants in Large Urban Counties, 2004 (a sample that is representative of the large urban counties that account for roughly half of the nation's violent crimes):\n \n 83% had a prior adult arrest (compared to likely 25% or so of the adult U.S. population).\n \n 76% had two or more prior adult arrests.\n \n 55% had five or more prior adult arrests.\n \n 65% had a prior adult conviction.\n \n 44% had a prior adult felony conviction (compared to about 7.5% of the adult U.S. population, see Christopher Uggen et al., Citizenship, Democracy, and the Civic Reintegration of Criminal Offenders, 605 Annals Am. Acad. Pol. & Soc. Sci. 281, 288 (2006)).\n \n This does not include \"arrests or convictions that occurred while the defendant was a juvenile\" (I quote here from an e-mail from the author of the report). Since nearly half of all homicide offenders are 24 or under, the exclusion of juvenile arrests and convictions is thus likely to substantially undercount the actual arrest and conviction record. This also doesn't include arrests or convictions that the state effectively expunged or never logged, for instance because someone was allowed a \"deferred adjudication,\" which is essentially probation in lieu of a conviction, so that no conviction would be entered if the probation is finished with no observed violations.\n \n Note that these numbers have been increasing in the past decades, though I can't tell whether this is because changes in who commits crimes, changes in criminal apprehension rates, or changes in states' keeping good track of criminal histories.\n \n The Volokh Conspiracy - Who Are the Murderers (and Voluntary Manslaughterers)?",
