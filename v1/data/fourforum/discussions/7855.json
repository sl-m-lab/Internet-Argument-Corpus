But then again that's what religion's for, right? (seriously, I'm not trying to be sarcastic). If you look at religion from a neutral standpoint it looks like there's no proof, but it helps many people live, and even though I don't buy into it (because I need proof to TRULY believe something), even if we find out that religion was totally false, it has helped many people get through life with feelings of hope. Now that's why I really don't care for organized religion so much, but these scientific surveys miss the point of what religion is. It's faith. It doesn't matter how much evidence there is. To a religious person, \"I believe it's true\" is just as good as \"It's true\". And as long as they don't try to force those beliefs on me, I'm fine with that (but when they do, watch out!).",

Would he just let me suffer if I failed to pray and pester for relief?\n \n If prayer is just a form of worship (that gives praise to God), why does this omnipotent spirit require laudatory hymns etc., from mere humanity?\nVery valid points. It's unclear from scripture: we are told\n \n 'And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words.' (Matthew 6:7-15 Lord's Prayer Version 1)\n \n But also:\n And He said to them, \"Which of you shall have a friend, and go to him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine has come to me on his journey, and I have nothing to set before him'; and he will answer from within and say, 'Do not trouble me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give to you'? I say to you, though he will not rise and give to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will rise and give him as many as he needs. So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.\n \n (Luke 11 5-10)\n \n An interesting website I came across while looking these up: http://aibi.gospelcom.net/articles/lords_prayer_intro.html\n \n \n \n Again, I would add that the reasons you offer for praying are not the only ones: many see it as communion with God. A poetic example of this, by a man of deep scepticism but sometimes astonishing faith:\n \n R S Thomas:\n \n Emerging\n \n Not as in the old days I pray,\n God. My life is not what it was.\n Yours, too, accepts the presence of\n the machine? Once I would have asked\n healing. I go now to be doctored,\n to drink sinlessly of the blood\n of my brother, to lend my flesh\n as manuscript of the great poem\n of the scalpel.

I begin to recognise\n you anew, God of form and number.\n There are questions we are the solution\n to, others whose echoes we must expand\n to contain.

What exactly, I wondered, were these people praying for? The prolonging of JP's earthly life, and hence his suffering? The prolonging of his earthly life without the debilitating illness (in which case you'd have to ask why god had visited the illness on him in the first place, if he were willing to rescind it on request)? That god should have mercy on him after his death? (In which case, if a celibate and apparently blameless Pontiff requires such earnest mass intercession, what hope is there for the average Joe?)\n \n I came to the conclusion that the praying crowds were probably having zero impact on the progress of the dying Pope, but were making themselves feel a lot better.

   "The Limitations of Science\n \n Mankind has never devised a better tool for solving the mysteries of the universe than science. However, there are some kinds of questions for which scientific problem solving is unsuited. In other words, science has limitations.\n \n There are three primary areas for which science can't help us answer our questions. All of these have the same problem: The questions they present don't have testable answers. Since testability is so vital to the scientific process, these questions simply fall outside the venue of science.\n \n The three areas of limitation are\n \n Science can't answer questions about value. For example, there is no scientific answer to the questions, \"Which of these flowers is prettier?\" or \"which smells worse, a skunk or a skunk cabbage?\" And of course, there's the more obvious example, \"Which is more valuable, one ounce of gold or one ounce of steel?\" Our culture places value on the element gold, but if what you need is something to build a skyscraper with, gold, a very soft metal, is pretty useless. So there's no way to scientifically determine value.\n \n Science can't answer questions of morality. The problem of deciding good and bad, right and wrong, is outside the determination of science. This is why expert scientific witnesses can never help us solve the dispute over abortion: all a scientist can tell you is what is going on as a fetus develops; the question of whether it is right or wrong to terminate those events is determined by cultural and social rules--in other words, morality. The science can't help here.\n \n Note that I have not said that scientists are exempt from consideration of the moral issues surrounding what they do. Like all humans, they are accountable morally and ethically for what they do.\n \n \n Finally, science can't help us with questions about the supernatural. The prefix \"super\" means \"above.\" So supernatural means \"above (or beyond) the natural.\" The toolbox of a scientist contains only the natural laws of the universe; supernatural questions are outside their reach. \n \n In view of this final point, it's interesting how many scientists have forgotten their own limitations. Every few years, some scientist will publish a book claiming that he or she has either proven the existence of a god, or proven that no god exists. Of course, even if science could prove anything (which it can't), it certainly can't prove this, since by definition a god is a supernatural phenomenon. \n \n So the next time someone invokes \"scientific evidence\" to support his or her point, sit back for a moment and consider whether they've stepped outside of these limitations. \n \n http://www.cod.edu/people/faculty/fancher/Limits.htm",

He has been married to my grandmother for 63 years and they are extremely close, and his sickeness is tearing her apart mentally. Is there any prayer or blessing that I can recite for his health, for her sanity, or for the saneness of my family? He is a kohen, but I am not sure if that makes me one, since it is my mother's father and my father is gentile. I cannot read Hebrew, but prefer to say prayers with the English transliteration. Please help in anyway possible! A sheynam dank!\n \n Answer (from the Rabbi) \n \n When you become aware of a member of your community who is ill, share these prayers of healing and commit to learn what specific ways you may be of help.What can we say when we join together formally to pray for one who is sick? What can we say at a board or committee meeting, at services or in any group setting when we become aware of those people who can not be with us because they are sick? \n \n A Meditation \n El na refa na lah. \n Please God, bring healing. \n \n A Blessing \n Mi-sheberakh avoteinu v'imoteinu, Avraham v'Sarah, Yitzhak v'Rivkah, Ya'akov, Rachel v'Leah hu y'varekh et (insert names here) v'yavi aleihem refuat hanefesh u'refuat haguf yachad im kol cholei amo Yisrael.

May those in whose care they are entrusted be gifted with wisdom and skill, and those who surround them be gifted with love and trust, openness and support in their care. And may they be healed along with all those who are in need. Blessed are You, Source of healing. \n \n Prayer for healing \n Hear my prayer, O Lord, heed my plea for mercy. \n In time of trouble I call You, for You will answer me. \n When pain and illness are my companions, let there be room in my heart for strength. \n When the days and nights are filled with darkness, let the light of courage find its place. \n Help me endure the suffering and dissolve the fear; renew within me the calm spirit of trust and peace. \n Boruch Atah Adonai, Ro-fei HaCholim \n We praise you, O God, Healer of the Sick \n \n http://experts.about.com/q/Reform-Judaism-950/Jewish-Prayers.htm\n \n Do you think you should call the rabbi up and let him know his prayers are worthless (according to you)?",
