   "As a Free State Project charter member I strongy recommend anyone who has the time to check this out.. Truly enlightening!\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Would it surprise you to discover that the United States is NOT a democracy? \n \n Have you ever wondered why people have to get a concealed carry permit to exercise their right to \"keep and bear arms\"? \n \n Would you like to know - once and for all - what the \"electoral college\" is, and why we have it? \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n You are cordially invited to attend an eight-hour class on the Constitution, presented by Constitutional scholar, Michael Badnarik. This class is a completely non-partisan study of the Constitution, not a promotional activity for any political party. Everyone is welcome. \n \n Attendees will receive a three-ring binder containing a 65-page handout for the class, and a copy of the founding documents. We will discuss the difference between rights and privileges, and talk about how political power is distributed to create various forms of government (monarchy, oligarchy, democracy, republic). Each Article and Section of the \"supreme law of the land\" will be analyzed, as well as related subjects such as the United States Code (USC) and Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). \n \n \n \n \n Seating is limited - Reservations are required \n (handouts are only printed for the number of students expected) \n \n \n Sunday, November 2nd \n 9am to 6pm at the Highlander Inn \n Manchester, New Hampshire \n Adults: $50 - Students: $20 \n \n \n \n \n To register: call (512) 799-8200, or send an eMail to",
