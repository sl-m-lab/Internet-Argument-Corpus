   "Scientists have traced the genetic lineage of the new H1N1 swine flu to a strain that emerged in 1998 in U.S. factory farms, where it spread and mutated at an alarming rate. Experts warned then that a pocket of the virus would someday evolve to infect humans, perhaps setting off a global pandemic.\n \n The new findings challenge recent protests by pork industry leaders and U.S., Mexican and United Nations agriculture officials that industrial farms shouldn&#8217;t be implicated in the new swine flu, which has killed up to 176 people and on Thursday was declared an imminent pandemic by the World Health Organization.\n \n &#8220;Industrial farms are super-incubators for viruses,&#8221; said Bob Martin, former executive director of the Pew Commission on Industrial Animal Farm Production, and a long-time critic of the so-called &#8220;contained animal feeding operations.&#8221;\n\n Swine Flu Ancestor Born on U.S. Factory Farms | Wired Science\n \n Oh! The joys of totally unrestrained capitalism! The joys of utterly free marketeering!\n \n Joy to child workers! Joy to sufferers of pandemic diseases!\n \n Unrestrained capitalism is wunnerful! wunnerful!",

Everything bad in Simone's world can be traced back to George Bush and / or capitalism.\n \n Even though the article you posted admits the following:\n \n \n\"The new swine flu could have emerged in a myriad number of ways, passing between any number of birds and pigs and people, at locations across North America, during its evolutionary journey. It may well prove impossible to pinpoint exactly where it first emerged or became infectious to people. But most of its genes are almost certainly part of a North American industrial virus lineage long expected to produce pandemic variants like this one.\n \n 'We haven't found evidence of infected pigs,' said Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University epidemiologist and member of the World Health Organization's surveillance network. 'But even if we never find that smoking pig, we can surmise that this is probably where it came from.'\n \n The circumstances 'are certainly enough to warrant asking questions,' said Lipkin. 'The question, then, is how deeply do you want to look to try to find the evidence?'\"\n\n \n Sounds pretty certain, huh? emoticon_rolleyes",

This country did pretty well so far without cradle to grave concerge service from the gubment. No one is saying that there is no place for govt. and a safety net.

You go in to the doctor and get checked out, even if you feel fine. You get some tests and an examination and the purpose is to prevent a serious problem down the road. You go to the mechanic to get checked out, even if your car seems fine. You get an oil change, tire rotation, and an inspection. The purpose is to prevent a serious problem down the road.\n \n Proponents of national health care say the greater availability of preventative care with lower costs because it will prevent the occurrence of serious problems. First off, you can't guarantee preventative care will catch a problem in time to avoid a serious issue in every case. Secondly, you can't be sure catching a problem early will actually prevent a serious problem in every case. Third, encouraging preventative maintenance will mean more people going to the doctor for regular checkups, which will cost more money.\n \n The bottom line is, the idea that greater preventative care lowers costs is a myth.\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/health/views/07essa.html",
