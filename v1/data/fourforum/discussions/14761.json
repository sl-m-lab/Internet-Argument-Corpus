   "wake me up when theres zombies.\nWell there were--but it apparently was, at the very least, badly reported. As Tom Paine commented: \nThe book ascribed to Matthew says 'there was darkness over all the land from the sixth hour unto the ninth hour--that the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom--that there was an earthquake--that the rocks rent--that the graves opened, that the bodies of many of the saints that slept arose and came out of their graves after the resurrection, and went into the holy city and appeared unto many.' Such is the account which this dashing writer of the book of Matthew gives, but in which he is not supported by the writers of the other books.\n \n It is an easy thing to tell a lie, but it is difficult to support the lie after it is told. The writer of the book of Matthew should have told us who the saints were that came to life again, and went into the city, and what became of them afterwards, and who it was that saw them; for he is not hardy enough to say that he saw them himself;--whether they came out naked, and all in natural buff, he-saints and she-saints, or whether they came full dressed, and where they got their dresses; whether they went to their former habitations, and reclaimed their wives, their husbands, and their property, and how they were received; whether they entered ejectments for the recovery of their possessions, or brought actions of crim. con. against the rival interlopers; whether they remained on earth, and followed their former occupation of preaching or working; or whether they died again, or went back to their graves alive, and buried themselves.\n \n Strange indeed, that an army of saints should retum to life, and nobody know who they were, nor who it was that saw them, and that not a word more should be said upon the subject, nor these saints have any thing to tell us! Had it been the prophets who (as we are told) had formerly prophesied of these things, they must have had a great deal to say. They could have told us everything, and we should have had posthumous prophecies, with notes and commentaries upon the first, a little better at least than we have now. Had it been Moses, and Aaron, and Joshua, and Samuel, and David, not an unconverted Jew had remained in all Jerusalem. Had it been John the Baptist, and the saints of the times then present, everybody would have known them, and they would have out-preached and out-famed all the other apostles. But, instead of this, these saints are made to pop up, like Jonah's gourd in the night, for no purpose at all but to wither in the morning.\n \n",

   "what is said in a particular religious scripture. genesis 1: you can either think \"yea, i think that happened\" or \"nah, thats a load of rubbish.\" humans tend to make personal assessments when dealing with opinions, rather than saying \"well, i dont know, im stumped.\"\n\n As for religious scripture, no, I don't believe any of it (christian, jewish, muslim, hindu, buiddhist, to be based in fact or reality. To me, they represent mans effort to understand that which we simply cannot understand. I think some of them have good ideas on how we as humans should live, but that's another subject. \n \n \n when was the last time you fully knew about an opinion on a subject but didnt have one yourself?\n\n Just because I have an opinion on something does not mean that I am certain one way or another. I think man-made religion as we know it is nothing more than a sham that was originally thought of as a way of explaining things we don't understand, and has evolved into a way of controlling people. Does that discount the possiblity of a higher power...no. \n \n \nthats really the only case i can see as being truly agnostic, if you dont know the argument, which im pretty confident you do. very young kids are arguably agnostic. but then again, you could be thinking in the same way i am when i call everybody agnostics - there simply isnt enough evidence for anyone to make a conclusion, but again thats philosophy, not religion. religion deals with faith or lack of faith. either you have the faith bug or you dont.\n\n When I think of the possibility of a \"god\", I think of the universe. Where did it come from...a big bang? Ok, I'll buy the big bang theory...a singularity of energy floating around that exploded into what we today know as the universe (btw: I know that is a higly simplified version...just making a point). Where did that energy come from? What was the place that the singularity was floating around in? What made it happen? \n \n These are questions that we as humans do not have answers to, and probably will never have answers to, but they do require that they be asked. So many \"atheists\" and \"agnostics\" seem content with the answer that \"god\" didn't create the universe, the big bang did. I am simply not satiated with this. There must be more out there than a big bang. Everything that we have, see, touch, and know in the entire universe had to have come from somewhere or something. A higher power...perhaps. Do I think it is some old man with a snowy white beard floating around watching us in the bathroom...no. \n \n So where does the apetheist side come in? Just like this: am I curious about these questions?...sure, I think at some level everyone is. Do I care if they are ever answered in my lifetime...no.

No.\n\n \n i agree with all of this. however, i think we're still talking about philosophy here. i used to use the term \"technical agnostic\" to illustrate that we all dont actually know where the universe came from, but i think ill start using \"philosophical agnostic\" instead. i hate to judge you or label you, but so far as i can tell, from a religious stand point you are an atheist. youve expressed your disbelief for any religious scripture as being a true testamant to reality, and your reluctance to follow religious doctrine - that alone makes you an atheist. i see no reason to label yourself an agnostic when it comes to religion, religion is like the swine flu - either you have it or you dont, and theres not really any doubt in whether you have it or not.\n \n however, i am very happy to call myself an agnostic, along with everyone else when it comes to philosophy. youve shown the reasons for \"philosophical agnosticism\" (emoticon_xgood) which are very applicable, and exactly the reasons why everybody is a \"philosophical agnostic\".",
