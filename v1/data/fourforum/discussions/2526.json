The latest GTO is a typical niche model, sells in small numbers, is expensive to buy and has a large displacement engine in a heavy car that attracts a gas guzzler tax.\n If pony cars are to sell in any kinds of numbers they would have to be no more than 3,000 lbs in weight, and have a 3 liter V6 and efficient 4 liter V8, but no bigger than that. If domestic producers made something like that and priced it low then it might work. However, I don't get the impression that the new Mustang will be along those lines.",

The Firebird and Camaro were small cars under the medium sized intermediate Chevelle/Tempest. Below the Mustang, Firebird, Camaro were the sub compacts, cars like the Ford Pinto, Chevy Vega, AMC Gremlin.\n I'm sure a 3,000 lb 4 liter V8 rear drive domestic coupe could compete against the turbocharged Japanese imports, and that's the sort of car the Camaro/Firebird should be if they return. Trends could turn around, who would have thought at the start of the 80s that people would one day be buying 4-5,000 lb SUVs that get less than 20 mpg?",

   "The Pinto was a cute looking car. Vulnerable gas tanks aside, they were cheap buys in the 70s and more than a few enterprising people dropped in 302s, but at least you could do that sort of thing in those days because the Pinto was rear drive. Cars like the Monza, AMC Hornet, Gremlin could all take V8s because although they were small they happened to be rear drive.\n Legend has it that when the V8 became available in the AMC Gremlin in 1972 (304 V8) one dealer offered a swap package that replaced the 304 with the big 401 (6.6 liters!!), and that car did 12 second 1/4 mile out of the box as an automatic. In the dying days of the Yenko operation they offered the little Chevy Vega with the Camaro Z/28's 350 engine (1971/72), before government authorities found out.\n A smallish, affordable rear drive coupe with a normally aspirated V8 would be a fun alternative to the turbo imports, easier to hot up too. emoticon_xangel",
