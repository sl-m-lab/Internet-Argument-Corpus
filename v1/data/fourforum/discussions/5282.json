   "'British imperialism in America' is a joke. The people rebelling for the large part considered themselves British citizens, at least at first. They were protected by the British armed forces and refused to pay to support them. To be more accurate, there were a few semio-criminal merchants who were against the tariffs and stirred the whole thing up. The true imperialism was against the native peoples, and one of the bones of contention in the revolution was the British authorities refusal to support American desires to expand into territories that had been agreed by treaty to belong to the Indians. The racist element was brought out in a recent history programme showing a classic picture of the first American patriot 'martyrs' (protesters who baited soldiers, who opened fire). The names are listed, but the Native American who was killed is drawn as white and several of the soldiers are shown as black or Native American which is unlikely historically.\n \n Also, calling Columbus one of the great heroes of history along with Christ and Mohammed is a joke, and ridiculously Americo-centric. What about Marx? Luther? Hitler? If Columbous hadn't come along someone else would have.\n \n As far as explorers go I'd say Raleigh, as he's responsible for the popularity of tobacco, rather than marijuana. that could have effected history a lot.",
