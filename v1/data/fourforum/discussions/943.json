   "The NFL season has started and I am pumped up after the games this week! I really enjoyed watching the Bills cream the Patriots especially after that Milloy trade went through less than a week ago.\n \n So how many NFL fans do we have here? What are your favorite teams and who do you think is going to the Super Bowl this year?\n \n I have been a Bills fan since I was little. It has been 10 painful seasons and 4 blown Super Bowls but I have never waivered in my support of the team. This year is no different! Not too many people are predicting them to make the playoffs this year but I just gotta believe after their performance this week that they are going to show the world what they are made of! They will make the playoffs and I think they have an outside shot at fifth chance to lose the Super Bowl to the Tampa Bay Bucs! An obvious choice to win, I know, but I still think they are the best around in this extremely balanced league.\n \n Mix in some college football if you wish emoticon_smile",

Could that mean they will get the cursed rank of #1 on the ESPN power rankings this week? Are the Bills actually the best team in the NFL right now? I don't think they are the best but with how bad some of the better teams have been doing, they just might be the only team that can legitimately be put at #1 this week other than the Chiefs.",

Not that I shouldn't be happy since the chart is cursed and being #1 generally means you lose, but still I wanted to see the Bills be on top just once because I know that is probably all they will get!\n \n Well as long as they beat Miami this week then they will have to be put at the top!

The Dolphins are the better team and some thought going into this season that they could win the AFC East. I still believe the Dolphins are this good and that is why I am worrying going into this game. I hope the Bills are deserving of the rank of #2 in the league but I doubt it and I think we could find that out in this game. If the Bills do win though, then I think their victory will be a powerful statement and raise expectations for the Bills even further. A win for the Chiefs over the Texans is almost assumed and I can't see them getting a whole lot of credit for a win there.\n \n PS: Lines for the games on Sunday: Dolphins by 3 and Chiefs by 7 1/2.
