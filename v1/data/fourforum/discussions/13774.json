   "This is more or less a rebuttal to a website owned by someone on this forum.\n \n \n- Well over 99% of humans are Truth-hating, irrational, and mentally deranged.\n\n \n By truth-hating, irrational and deranged, do you mean they disagree with you? That's logically equivalent to saying anyone who didn't support Barack Obama was a racist.\n \n \n- Well over 99% of humans are suicidal and/or homicidal and/or sadistic. Usually all three.\n\n \n Then why is it that well over 99% of human beings have never committed homicide or suicide and believe that it is good to respect others, at least as long as they respect you? What makes these people homicidal, suicidal, and sadistic?\n \n \n- Societies worldwide are based on lies, myths, insanities and deragements, whether they be western \"democratic\" societies or not.\n\n \n And what might these lies, myths, and derangments be?\n \n \n- Societies worldwide are currently engaged in the mass conditioning (brainwashing) of thier citizen-slaves.\n\n \n How might that be?\n \n \n- All societies worldwide demonise and hate the Truth as part of thier fundamental operational core. They employ false ridicule of the Truth.\n\n \n What might this \"truth\" be? And what evidence is there for this \"truth\"?\n \n \n- Every value and institution in society is false, harmful and designed to subject you to injustice, to enslave you and break you.\n\n \n How are we enslaved? By the fact that we go to work every day and get a paycheck? You might call welfare freedom from slavery, but I call it being a leech.\n \n \n- All societies worldwide grant \"parents\" (who are actually child-slave-owners) official societal permission to abuse and destroy certain innocent children that society has malevolently and insanely decreed to be the worthless property of the slave-owner.\n\n \n And how would you reccomend raising a child? Also, what qualifies you as an expert? I expect you to defend your lack of credentials on the grounds that experts are just societal tools used to brainwash people.\n \n Most parents make do what they think is best for their child. Just because a child is not pampered and catared to doesn't mean they're abused. Telling your child to work will put work ethic in them as long as you work hard with them and set an example. It's not slavery or abuse, and in the long run, it'll do more good for a child than bad. If a child does not have work ethic, they will grow up to be a leech living of SSI or mopping floors at Wal-Mart while posting websites on the internet about how society is responsible for their failure and how they're smarter than everyone else.\n \n \n- All societies worldwide deny that they are abusing thier children en-masse because society, as well as the abusing parents, want/need to keep up thier illusion of decency. Societal leaders make these denials on behalf of adult citizen-slaves.\n\n \n Who are societal leaders? If you're not sure who they are, can you prove that they exist?\n \n \n- Societies worldwide wrongly teach children that they themselves have no value, and that thier task is to be of value to others. This is why suicide and depression are so common in society. Society attacks and strips nearly all humans of their natural Self-Love and self-esteem.\n\n \n Suicides and homicides happen. It's not what I would call common. And not believing that oneself is without flaw does not equate to low self-esteem. I assume you believe that right and wrong, in accordance to your \"true nature\", is something that is self-percieved, and therefore you are perfect because you decide what is right and wrong for yourself. Is that about right? If not, explain right and wrong yourself, and describe how society has no regard for it. If so, it's an \"I'm the only one that matters\" belief.\n \n Those in society who serve others are served by others. For example, you go to work to serve others, they pay money that ultimately ends up in your pocket. However, some people want to be served by society but don't want to serve it. You might call it freedom from the slavery of society. I call it laziness and greed.\n \n \n- The value or \"social status\" of an individual or particular citizen-slave is mainly evaluated by the willingness to believe in and obey the insane cultural and societal systems/beliefs of thier particular society and how much work they perform to upkeep their malevolent society.\n\n \n You seriously believe that? LOL, success in life is based on intelligence, work ethic, and luck. The only person who changes how well you succeed in life is yourself. But it's easy for people to blame their own failure in life on some societal heirarchy whose existence they can't even prove.\n \n \n-The socially decreed value of an individual citizen-slave's life is virtually nil, unless preventing loss of that life will unveil society's lack of morality.\n\n \n So you think society is out to get you? That's paranoia. Tell me, if you're such a threat to society, how many attempts on your life have been made? If any, can you prove that society is responsible? Can you prove that societical heirarchy wants you dead, or that it even exists for that matter?\n \n Also, like I said before, others support people if people are willing to support others. Every legitimate job you can get is meant to serve others. Obviously, if you work as a bartender you give people service. If you work in a factor you're making products that will ultimately be purchased by somebody for use. If you work in agriculture you're putting food on people's table. The ideal society is one for all, all for one. No society can ever be perfect, but the pros outweigh the cons. People shouldn't be rewarded for laziness and failure, but they think they should, so they blame society for their failure.\n \n And if society lacks morality, then why don't you define what you think is morality?\n \n Finally, you were completely wrong in saying that society eliminates its \"enemies.\" Do people here think you're a deranged, paranoid fool? Yes. Do we think you deserve to die? No.\n \n \n- Society singles out a select minority (about .5%) and blames, demonises and persecutes them thier whole lives. These individuals are more decent/reasonable/non-violent than those who persecute them. In fact, decency is inverse.\n\n \n Who might these people be? People who agree with you? Almost every one of them I met was some loser living off welfare or SSI (which is funded by society and the government, I might add) while blaming society and the government for their failure, biting the hand that feeds them.\n \n \n- Society creates all the crimes and abuses we see in society today via its harmful, unnatural operational structures. The law and societal institutions have no rational integrity. \n \n - The justice system is deliberately designed and operated to deny justice to individuals. What society claims justice to be is actually a travesty of justice.\n\n \n Perhaps you could explain what is so corrupt about the justice system, along with providing your idea of justice. Just because you disagree with society doesn't mean it's unjust.\n \n \n- The justice system seeks no Truth, in fact, it is deliberately structured in such a way as to hide the Truth.\n\n \n Once again, what is this \"truth\"? And can you provide evidence for it.\n \n \n- Dictionaries and societally-promoted ideas and reasoning systems are deliberatly biased and designed to hide Truth, and rig debates and court proceedings.\n\n \n Such as?\n \n Also, I'd like you to answer these questions.\n [*]Is it possible for a society of your own devising to be honest? If so, what would make it more honest than other societies?[*]What do you do for a living? Do you work? Are you having financial success in life?[*]What plan do you have for taking down society? Or don't you have one?",

Psychopaths have been shown in recent years to exhibit abnormal pre-frontal cortex response, as well as other abnormal neurophysiology.

Just as an animal predator will adopt all kinds of stealthy functions in order to stalk their prey, cut them out of the herd, get close to them and reduce their resistance, so does the psychopath construct all kinds of elaborate camoflage composed of words and appearances - lies and manipulations - in order to \"assimilate\" their prey.\n The Psychopath: The Mask of Sanity\n \n\n \n Here is a good summary of the psychopath and psychopathic behavior.

Such as public nudity (perfectly natural) is something to be ashamed about.\n \n Yes, most emotions are legitimate and natural. However, the actual use and application of these emotions is usually completely distorted by society.\n \n \nEmotion is not a social control, but a natural function of the human brain. \n\n No, shame and remorse is not a natural function.\n \n \nPsychopaths have been shown in recent years to exhibit abnormal pre-frontal cortex response, as well as other abnormal neurophysiology.\n\n That is irrational. Since society educates and programs all citizen-slaves to believe in lies, the scientists in this experiment have done nothing but reflect that brainwashing.\n \n Since the human brain scans need to be interpreted, you have wasted your time scanning the brain by having human brains interpret these results.\n \n For example, we could say that the psychopaths brains are all correct, and everyone else's different from theirs. We could then conclude that My Truths that most human brains are faulty and malfunctioning is correct. And it is.\n \n \nThis is why psychopaths are manipulative, predatory victimizers who can at the same time view themselves as victims.\n\n No, it is not why. Those tests are simply a different expression of what you claim.\n \n Psychopaths are victims of society and extreme childhood neglect and abuse. It is a matter of social and psychiatric study, not brain scans. Psychopaths just use their 'tools' in the optimum way. Being predatory in a dangerous world is a good thing. \n \n \nThey possess the ability to feign emotions without actually experiencing them, which makes them efficient at concealing their true identity. \n\n Ever heard of an actor? Well, everyone is an actor in real life (except XXXXXX). Psychopaths are just more skilled at it.\n \n \nBecause you are superior to everyone else...right?\n\n No. I dont idolise anyone because I am unique, I have My own True Reality. What Gary did does not meld with My True Reality. Although I rightly praise the Truth-based portions of Gary's actions and life choices, I do so because I glorify Truth and the individuals attitude of self-preservation.\n \n \nLack of a conscience is one of the hallmark signs of a psychopath. You clearly meet this criteria. \n\n Conscience is what society teaches you. Its not natural, and its a lie.\n \n \nTo the psychopath, yes, it is considered superior and useful.\n\n It is useful and Superior, not just considered. Most top business men and women are psychopathic. They play their cards the best they can. And why not?\n \n \nHere is a good summary of the psychopath and psychopathic behavior. You can read all about yourself.\n\n No point reading it.\n \n \nQuote Seer T:\n A tiger could be seen as a psychopath, except it is not human. Yet its cold mental state is natural. There is nothing wrong with being cold and calculating.\n \n\n Quote:\n In short, the psychopath - and the narcissist to a lesser extent - is a predator. If we think about the interactions of predators with their prey in the animal kingdom, we can come to some idea of what is behind the \"mask of sanity\" of the psychopath. Just as an animal predator will adopt all kinds of stealthy functions in order to stalk their prey, cut them out of the herd, get close to them and reduce their resistance, so does the psychopath construct all kinds of elaborate camoflage composed of words and appearances - lies and manipulations - in order to \"assimilate\" their prey.\n \n\n Ok. I win this point. You admit that psychopathic behaviour is natural. It is you conditioned non-psychopathic humans that act unnaturally.",

I don't care what you think, a world where everyone would murder, rape, steal, and lie as they pleased would be hell.\n \n Caring for beings other than ourselves is not slavery.

They all must be interpreted by human brains who are trained to understand normal structure, function, and value, who can use this knowledge to spot abnormalities or variations from the norm. \n \n \nFor example, we could say that the psychopaths brains are all correct, and everyone else's different from theirs.

I never suggested otherwise. Of course it is different. I did not need a test to tell Me that.\n \n \nPsychiatric study now includes studies such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography. \n \n\n No, these are used to get data to give to people undertaking these studies. There is a subtle difference.\n \n \nIf it were not for the predatory individuals, this world would be a lot less dangerous. Your \"logic\" is severely flawed.\n\n No, you are just a dork. The fact is that the world is not a nice place. One must deal with the environment they were born into. Whats illogical about that? Nothing.\n \n \nThe mere fact that 96% of humans can and do exist without being predatory in nature is testament to millions of years of evolution and human civilization. \n \n\n Most humans are \"predatory\", although this is not a natural form of predatory behaviour. You just refuse to admit that to yourself. Human civilization has done more damage and harm than any wild animals have. Destruction of environment, wars, murders, brainwashing all citizen-slaves to believe in delusions and insane dictates, do I need go on?\n \n \nWhat is \"unique\" about you? \n\n Everybody thing is unique.\n \n \nSeer : Most top business men and women are psychopathic.

Comparing the behavior of psychopaths to the observed behavior of predators in the wild is not the same as saying that their behavior is rooted in the same origins. Take a lion for example. What is the need for the lion to act in a predatory manner? Now think about your boy Gary Ridgeway. What is the need for him to act in a predatory manner. I would bet that you find 2 completely different motivations.\n\n I know. But that is not the point. You are trying to claim Gary's behaviour is psychopathic behaviour and that to be unnatural and faulty. That is not correct.\n \n You dont seem to realise that behaviour is not the issue.

They only tell you what is. Since we already knew what, we are just getting another way of saying what.\n\n Wrong. The tests are leading to a better understanding of the neurotranmitters and neurophysiological respoinses in the brain. This can help to determine what causes these observed psychopathic neurological responses, and can lead us to better treatments for sick minds like your and Gary's. \n \n \nIt was you (or other humans) that made the conclusions, based on things not inherant in the tests.\n\n Sure. As again, every test is done to draw some sort of conclusion. What it concludes is that people with psychopathic personalities have observable variations in neurological activity, and these variations prove essential in understanding why a psychopathic brain functions as it does. This in turn leads to understanding how to treat people effectively. Like it or not, modern society and science is plotting against people like you and Gary.\n \n \nYes, but you are using the very \"norms\" we are discussing to do so, not the test.\n\n When attempting to indentify variation and abnormality, we must first understand what normal is. Words like \"normal\", \"variable\", \"deviation\", are things you would find in a statistics class or psych test and measurements class. There has to be an agreed upon normal, and you ain't it. Unfortunately for you, society has decided that your brain is abnormal, which puts you at a disadvantage. \n \n \nNo, you are just a dork. The fact is that the world is not a nice place. One must deal with the environment they were born into. Whats illogical about that? Nothing.\n\n Nothing. So long as you don't victimize others. Unfortunately, psychopaths are most often lifelong victimizers who show little to no conscience, and will continue to be a victimizer all their lives unless stopped by an outside force. Again, this is what society has agreed to, not my rules. You are on the losing side. \n \n \nMost humans are \"predatory\", although this is not a natural form of predatory behaviour. You just refuse to admit that to yourself. Human civilization has done more damage and harm than any wild animals have. Destruction of environment, wars, murders, brainwashing all citizen-slaves to believe in delusions and insane dictates, do I need go on?\n\n Sure, can you? \n \n \nEverybody thing is unique.\n\n I will assume you meant \"everyone is unique\". No matter. I asked what makes you unique. If you want to have intelligent debate, you need to answer a question once in a while when asked. \n \n \nFalse dichotomy. Besides, it common knowledge.\n\n What \"false dichotomy\"? And no, it is not common knowledge. Psychopaths are approximately 4% of the worlds population. From everything I have ever read, they are represented as about 3-4% of the business world. \n \n \n \nI know. But that is not the point. You are trying to claim Gary's behaviour is psychopathic behaviour and that to be unnatural and faulty. That is not correct.\n\n Gary's behavior is psychopathic, based on what society has agreed is psychpathic. Society has not only termed it to be unnatural and faulty, but criminal and worthy of severe punishment up to and including death. \n \n \nYou dont seem to realise that behaviour is not the issue. Mental state is the issue. Maybe you just dont have the brain capacity to understand.\n\n Sure it is. Your behavior is what is observable to society. Behavior is often affected by mental state, but only an individual ever fully knows his own mental state.",

Their true identity is that of someone who is extraordinarily egocentric and lacking in a conscience and ability to experience genuine emotion through normal stimulus. Psychopaths are often ruthless, cold, calculating, and always on the lookout for a way to take advantage of others. In terms of killers, Ted Bundy is a good example of a psychopath who was able to blend into society. \n \n But understand that while psychopaths are far more likely to end up in prison than the non-psychopath for a myriad of crimes, the majority of them are not killers. What grabs so much attention and draws to mind the vicious psychopathic killer is the fact that the ones that we do catch are very efficient at what they do, and often get away with their crimes for long periods of time while the bodies pile up.

Luckily it's under warranty.\n \n \n Basically it has a bad circuit board and a couple wires came out of the bundle and kept rubbing on the painted black marks on the flywheel that a sensor detects for proper SMPH....\n \n So they gotta ship it all the way back east to MTH and get a new board and motor put in the locomotive. So it will be a couple of weeks before I get it back at least...\n \n But hey I'm glad I caught it within the first week of purchase. Now I have plenty of time to clean the garage and build my permanent layout. My dad and I just spent a few hours in the garage cleaning out a space. It's like 8x10 is around there. More than enough space for 0-36 curves and a couple sidings or whatnot.\n \n Btw are your trains o gauge? And what brand?\n \n \n I'm also heading to the Long Beach Train convention on Sunday.

   "Well an update. My dad and I caught the last two hours of the convention and I couldn't believe what I found for sale in a booth. An awesome Proto sound 1.0 Railking Big Boy 4-8-8-4. \n \n \n Omg this thing is nuts!!! It runs on O-31 curves, has all the sounds, smokes like a beast and is in perfect condition. The price shocked me too. Most Big Boys go for around 700-1000 easily.\n \n Old Premier line ones go for 700+. This baby was only 400!!! Needless to say we put it on layaway for 100 bucks and I'll be picking it up within a couple weeks once work speeds up hopefully.\n \n \n Here's a vid of it : YouTube - MTH BIGBOY TEST RUN PART 3 OUT OF 3\n \n YouTube - MTH BIGBOY TEST RUN PART 2 OUT OF 3\n \n \n \n \n \n And another showing the pulling power of this monster in G scale.
