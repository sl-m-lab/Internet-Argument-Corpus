   "Scott Harrison desperately tried to change his sexual orientation in various \"ex-gay\" ministries for eight years, three of them as a ministry leader in Southern California. Most of his experience with ex-gay groups - Christian organizations that see homosexuality as a choice that can be changed with proper therapy - was with Living Waters and Desert Stream, two curricula of a national ex-gay network that has more than 80 branches today. When Harrison joined in 1982, he felt ex-gay ministers were then a band of compassionate outsiders attending to the first AIDS victims. But by the end of that decade, Harrison had taken note of the movement's increasing radicalism, symbolized for him by the minister at the Vineyard Christian Fellowship in San Pedro, Calif., who performed an exorcism on him in an attempt to cast out the \"demons\" said to be the cause of his homosexuality. Harrison finally quit the movement in 1990 after deciding he could, after all, reconcile his sexuality with his Christian faith. Today, he speaks to parents of gay and lesbian children about the dangers he sees in the ex-gay movement. Harrison says the relatively recent alignment of Exodus International, one of the largest ex-gay groups with some 120 ministries in North America alone, with anti-gay Christian \"dominionists\" - people who want to impose Christian rules on the secular institutions of society - has led to ex-gay ministers pursuing a hard-line message with young people that can only end in mental anguish and failure. \n ....\n \n There's psychological damage when change doesn't occur, when sexual orientation remains homosexual. I certainly heard stories and knew people who committed suicide. I've seen what I believe is a higher incidence of risky behavior and alcohol and drug use among a lot of people who go through an ex-gay ministry. A lot of it is because of spiritual conflict that emerges going through that, feeling betrayed by God, feeling betrayed by the church.\n \n \n \n At the Exodus Revolution ex-gay conference this summer, you saw a speech by Michael Brown in which he encouraged people to \"give up their lives\" in the fight against homosexuality. What do you think of that?\n When you have a keynote speaker like Michael Brown, to me that's unacceptable. It's preaching a message of Christians not just simply opposing gay civil rights and believing a spiritual revival is necessary for this country, but actually calling on Christians to lay down their lives in a spiritual revolution to set up civil laws based on one extreme interpretation of biblical laws from the Old Testament [that calls for the death penalty for homosexuals]. It's Christian Reconstructionism [a doctrine that calls for imposing harsh Old Testament laws on civil society], Christian dominionism. It's abhorrent, and it's dangerous, not just for LGBT people but for our entire society. Because if civil laws are based on [Brown]'s interpretation of the Bible, it's not going to be a democratic society.\n http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=847\n \n \n Quite frankly, while I abhor any argument that argues \"most\" Christians are against gays, it needs to be noted that SOME Christians have made it their life's work to be against gays.\n The above is an interview with one man who was caught up in the \"ex-gay\" movement. He discusses his experience.",
