It is an opinion based on a criteria for 'adequate' function.\n \n But anyway...\n If you look for the thread \"AN EYR FOR MAKE BELIEVE\" which I wrote... it begins like this...\n An eye for make believe.\n Some people have declared that our eyes, if the part of a designer, are poorly designed. I don't see this. What I do see is an eye that allows us to enjoy beauty, art etc. Sure, we don't have X-ray vision, but our eyes are good enough. (I mention X-ray vision; what basis do people lay claim that our eyes aren't good enough; that we can't see through walls?)\n If we can now focus on possible evolutionary path-ways for the eye, we will see that evolutionaries have an eye for make believe.\n The classic case (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/l...1/l_011_01.html) Darwin looked at several existing eye structures, and suggested that this progression of simplest to more complex types of eyes might be suggestive of a path taken in human eye evolution.\n Firstly, the core word is 'might'. Thus it is not the all conclusive proof Darwinists would suggest. Where is the evidence that random changes did occur as they say? What caused these changes? Why were they only positive changes? As Michael Behe points out there's enormous complexity in re-arranging the DNA just to get a depression...Behe, M, \"Darwin's Black Box\", p16ff. Where is the molecular explanation?\n The Darwinist say...\"Every change had to confer a survival advantage, no matter how slight.\" Why? What about dead-ends? What about negative mutations?\n What Darwin has shown is what we can call 'conceptual evolution'.The logic behind this is akin to showing a series of pictures: skateboard, bicycle, motor-bike, motor car, etc. We can see that they get more complex, but did the design for a car stem from that of a skateboard? We see the connection between these things (eyes, vehicles etc) because we organise it in our brains... but I'm not going to explain perceptual organisation. \n There are other explanations (http://www.biol.lu.se/funkmorf/vision/evolution.html) The Lund Vision Group shows computer modelling to suggest how a complex human eye could evolve (see under Computer Modelling)\n \"the structures of a focused camera type eye can evolve in less than half a million generations\" (Ibid.)\n Wow that's quick... so in all that time we're to assume that they went around with mutations that still hadn't quite produced a working eye. It's a shot in the dark, but it might work, providing that the intervening generations didn't need proper vision! \n In just six diagrams we get a model of the eye. This is again a case of conceptual evolution... seeing patterns that are meaningless unless you draw a connexion between them. Richard Dawkins is so impressed with this that he features the image on his web-page.\n The fraud is more clearly seen at http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/...eye_stages.html\n If you look at the few diagrams here, starting with a light sensitive patch, moving to a more complex eye, we can see the deception of using a rubbery model. The thin line at the top of the light-sensitive spot does not change in each model, yet in the end is the lens! The light-sensitive spot wouldn't have a lens... so the one little line which remains the same in each picture represents in fact vastly different things.",

I responded by putting your accusation in context (He was criticizing Paley, and he never actually used this as evidence, just showing that it could go both ways). \n \n Now you go off on a tangent about how dawkins' logic is flawed, and how behe's logic is accurate... i don't want to get into that because, both dawkins' and behe's make much better arguments themselves (anyone reading, go out and get these books... behe is much more technical and raises some questions that must be answered, however makes (imo) some unwarranted conclusions at the end of his book. Dawkins is much less technical, however provides logical reasoning as to why evolution is possible and how it works)\n \n but i do want to point out that while this is an example of 2 different interpretations (good/bad designs in the eye) given the same thing, it is NOT used as any kind of scientific proof of anything. opinions are not objective scientific evidence because they are subjective.",

It is you who is placing faith in \"names of words\", whatever that means. It is ignorant in the extreme to think that gill slits in the embryo of a land vertebrate actually refer to gills. The same structures are sometimes called gill arches, gill pouches, pharyngeal pouches, pharyngeal arches or branchial arches. Wow! That's putting faith in names, isn't it. So many for the same structures that seem to be a matter of preference or first learning. (Kinda reminds you of the tens of thousands of christian faiths, doesn't it?) In fish, these actually develop into the gills. In other vertebrates they eventually form other structures (never actually becoming gills) like the eustachian tube, middle ear, tonsils, parathyroid, and thymus. It seems that you aren't aware that a name is just a lable for convenience.\n \n And you don't even know what a transitional fossil is. You have demonstrated that. You are the one who wants to put faith in a label. You require that every ancestor and every descendant be known. In reality, a transitional answers the prediction of forms that lie between two lineages. If between the thousands of species of dinosaurs that we know of and the thousands of species of birds there is a connection, then we should find many examples of fossils that represent several lines of diversification - one of these lines eventually became birds. Some lineages go extinct and others diversify to fill the nitch.\n \n But I'm still waiting for some evidence that supports your position. A statement of theory and the evidence that supports it.

Kalb \n In the last few hundred years, Africa has witnessed the slave trade, the ivory trade, the diamond trade, and the rubber trade, each representing a separate chapter of discovery and exploitation. In the 1920s, another type of \"trade\" burst onto the stage with the discovery of our oldest human ancestors, beginning with the Taung Child, Australopithecus africanus, found in South Africa in 1924. Then came the sensational discoveries in East Africa made by Louis and Mary Leakey in the 1950s and 1960s, and by their son in the late 1960s. Their discoveries produced unprecedented scientific \"wealth\" about our origins and instantly captured the public's attention. Although trafficking in humans and extracting minerals can hardly be equated with the pursuit of human origins, their respective quests have followed a similar trajectory: exploration, discovery, territorial competition, and personal gain. When the search for fossil hominids shifted to the Horn of Africa in the 1970s\u00d1specifically, the Afar Depression of Ethiopia\u00d1the stream of fossil and artifact discoveries that followed produced the longest and most complete single record of human fossil or artifact remains in the world. This book takes us behind the scenes of the explorations in this unique desert area, focusing especially on the 1970s, when the valley was first mapped and many fossils and archaeological sites were discovered, but continuing to the present. As co-founder of the expedition that discovered Lucy and leader of most of the first site-surveys in the Afar, Jon Kalb has years of experience with the region, its politics, and the scientists involved in the excavations. A participant himself in the \"bone wars\" that accompanied these discoveries, Kalb recounts the cut-throat competition and back stabbing that often were part of the media-highlighted race to find the oldest hominid fossil. He weaves this story in the rich fabric of Ethiopian society and politics, including the overthrow of Haile Sellassie (whose neighbor he was for a time), the brutal dictatorship that followed, the plight of the region's peoples, and the international maneuverings for control of the fossil finds. \" \n http://www.versiontech.com/origins/books/index.asp?movie_id=68&book_tab=1 \n Evidence does not point to a theory... except in the minds of theoreticians... as such it is but an artificial construct. \n *It says descent, Poirier, F E, \"In Search of Ourselves: An Introduction to Physical Anthropology\", p346ff \n **Preneanderthal Hypothesis: The theory, mainly applied to Europe, that proposes two separate lineages can be found in the Middle or Late Pleistocene.

The ones that usually do not even address their criticisms, but instead launch into personal attacks and conspiratorial nonsense? No, Monty, Dembski invites strife. His career has been built on it.\nOriginally Posted by SLP\n How does it feel to be lead along like so many lemmings?\n\n \n \n \n \n I don't know? Would you care to tell me?\n\n \n I wouldn't knoiw, as I am not the one who seems to believe that reading 'witness' essays by a bunch of religious conservatives equates to \"proof\" that evolutiuon is false. I am not the one that actually seems to believe that Dembski has done something that he keeps aying he will do or has done, yet will not or cannot actually point out where this is documented.\n \n Again, please stop projecting.\n\n \n \n But even worse an assumption is that Dembski is hiding something, by keeping all this information to himself, or his clique. You asserted this, I believe.\n\n \n I asserted that Dembski has not actually applied his filter to biological structures/phenomena as he has been promising to do for years, not that he has done it and is keeping it secret. That would be plain stupid, for Demsbki's biggest criticisms often revolve around the fact that he and his allies have yet to produce anything of substance.\n\n \n Simply, this is not the case...\n http://www.arn.org/docs/dembski/wd_explfilter.htm\n and\n http://www.windowview.org/ARNfiles/ExplanatoryFilterDembski.html\n and\n http://www-acs.ucsd.edu/~idea/dembski.htm\n\n \n Amazingly, your links actually support MY claim, and I'll bet that you simply do not understand that.\n \n I know all about the Caputo case. That is Dembski's old standard 'example.' But human contrivances are not biological structures, are they? \n \n By the way - did YOU even read the links? Did you not realize that they were all basically different versions of the same essay? Repackaging XXXX just gives you different versions of the same XXXX.\n\n \n \n OR\n \n If the information wasn't out there, then this negative critique could never have been drawn up...\n http://www.nctimes.net/~mark/bibl_science/dembski.htm\n and\n http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/sept98.html\n and\n http://www.talkreason.org/articles/dem_nfl.cfm\n \n \n So, there is already a debate raging. I'm sorry you missed it.\n\n \n I'm sorry that you failed to understand simple terms and phrases.\n \n Where in those articles has Dembski applied his filter to anything biological?\n \n From one of the links:\n \n \"To my knowledge, this is at least the sixth time Dembski published a description of the device which allegedly enables one to reliably distinguish among the three causal antecedent of an event &#8211; necessity (also referred to as regularity or law), chance and design.\"\n \n Funny - there is no mention of an actual specific instance in whihc this 'filter' has worked, much less been applied to, biological phenomena.\n \n So again, MY point is supported.\n \n You do seem to be a bit like Dembski, I will say.\n \n he too often feels the need to respond with something whenever a critic points out the failings of his claims. And you, like Dembski, usually miss the mark in your 'rebuttals'....",

   "What an unfun thread! Please lets stop taliking about what's his name.\n \n \nIf anyone was going to use the argument that our bodies are flawed to prove that God doesn't exist, that would be a debate that could be won. No one would debate that our bodies were made all that well although it is amazing that life could have started at just a single cell and worked it's way up to where it is today. So either God did a poor job or evolution did an absolutely spectacular job. Just how did evolution know that light existed and that it could be seen before creating the eye? How do we know that there are not many other senses that exist which evolution will show us one day?\n\n \n There is a theory that adresses this... It says that the six days of creation actually meant six ages. The seventh day began after Man and Woman had been created, and from then till now is still the seventh day - the day of rest. God made humans steward over nature, but we have failed. So nature begins to be ruined. Also, when Adam and Eve ate the apple, it had consequences. First of all, they would no longer be immortal. (accomplished by having teleomeres cut off at each cell divide) So the human race was no longer perfect, and continued to degenerate by random mutation and the effect of sin. I think this would explain the instances of imperfection, as well as explain why there were occasional bursts of new species in the past, while none appear now, and thousands dissapear. I think that the cases of imperfections seem pretty niggardly compared to what I consider the miracle of life. \n \n An interesting note is that the Bible says 'in the end times' knowledge will increase.

   "There is a subtle difference here in arguments over Dembski.\n \n There seems to be one person repeating the same thing, but hinting at another. If SLP were to say that filter can't be applied, that is totally different from saying that he hasn't attempted to do so.\n \n SLP said...\n Post 33: I asserted that Dembski has not actually applied his filter to biological structures/phenomena as he has been promising to do for years...\n \n and again at the same post\n \n Post 33: That is what Dembski has been doing.

He has attempted to apply it (which disproves the allegation made by SLP). It is not the same as saying that the filter could not be applied, because the filter does not work!

If SLP were to say that filter can't be applied, that is totally different from saying that he hasn't attempted to do so.\n\n \n If one actually understands the argument, there is no confusion. The 'filter' fails on a number of levels, I did not feel the need to elucidate them all. AGAIN - for the LAST TIME - Dembski has been claiming for YEARS that his filter can detect design in Nature. DETECT DESIGN in NATURE.\n NOT that it can theoretically deduce 'design' in DNA if one appends all sorts of contingent paramters.\n But anyway...\n\n SLP said...\n Post 33: I asserted that Dembski has not actually applied his filter to biological structures/phenomena as he has been promising to do for years...\n \n and again at the same post\n \n Post 33: That is what Dembski has been doing. He has been trotting out his silly 'filter' as a way of 'proving' Intelligent Design in Nature (well, bacterial flagella, anyway) for several years, yet he has essentially refused to actually apply the filter to any biological structure.\n \n repeated again...\n \n Post 37: he has yet to produce an actual instance in which he has applied his 'filter'\n \n and again\n \n Post 40: There is no mention of Dembski doing this.

You continue to be unable to understand this.\n If he has done so, it should be EASY for you to prove me wrong.\n\n \n All quite correct. Whats your point? That old 'win by volume' schtick?\n\n \n \n HOWEVER\n I said (Post 39)\n \"Dembski has applied his explanatory filter to the biochemical structures in cells -- and concluded that blind natural selection could not have created them.\"\n http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/artic...08/MN146337.DTL\n \n Quite clearly this refutes the assertion that Dembski has not attempted to apply his filter.\n\n No, it doesn't, because you obvioulsy did not actually read that article, nor especially the article it referred to.\n\n But to say that Dembski is in hiding, nor that he has applied the filter and that he's not published is ludicrous.\n\n \n Yes, that would be ludicrous. Good thing I never wrote anything remotely like that, and to imply otherwise is indicative of some sort of antisocial disorder.\n\n \n Thus a critique of Dembski says \"So information theory can be applied to DNA, but it is powerless precisely where Dembski needs it most.\"\n http://home.wxs.nl/~gkorthof/kortho44.htm\n \n This is saying that his filter can't be applied successfully - that is, it doesn't work. Not that he hasn't been attempted to apply it; which was the criticism of that poster: recall \"he has essentially refused to actually apply the filter.\"\n\n \n Did you read THAT link?\n \n \"Dembski defines Complex Specified Information, CSI, as \"any specified information whose complexity exceeds 500 bits of information\" (p166). Chance cannot generate CSI. However he didn't translate that into a concrete DNA sequence length. I did not find it in his book [20]. If he consulted Yockey [11] he would have noticed that the cytochrome-c family of genes (113 amino acids, 339 bases long) has an information content of 233 - 373 bits. This is clearly lower than 500 bits. So although cytochrome-c undoubtedly contains information, it does not classify as CSI. \"\n \n \"According to Dembski's own criteria a specified pattern needs to be independent of the event. The event is the observed DNA sequence. So we cannot use the observed DNA sequence to construct the specification for that DNA sequence. The specification must be constructed without recourse to the event. A typical example of a specification is the Fibonacci algorithm that generates an endless row of numbers, but the algorithm itself is very short (see paragraph below). This kind of algorithm can definitely not generate the information in DNA! It seems that neither a mathematical nor a non-mathematical specification of DNA is possible.\"\n \n You will also notice that in Dembski's response to Korthof's critique, he does not even bother to mention these major problems, but instead focuses on Korthof's section on false positives. Gotta write SOMETHING to make it look like he's right!\n \n So sorry, Monty - if he cannot even get the parameters right, if he needs to use contrived and utterly ridiculous preconditions, then no, he has NOT applied his filter, certainly not in any meaningful way.\n \n Here is a challenge. Consider this sequence of DNA:\n \n GTAAGTACATTCTAATTGTGGAGATTCTTTCTT\n \n Now consider this one:\n \n GACAGAAGGTTAGTATTCTCGATCTTCAAACTT\n \n \n \n One of those is an actual DNA sequence from the human genome. The other I just made up.\n \n The filter should be able to tell.\n \n Could it? Of course not. Why? Because one needs to know a bit more information than would be available from just looking at the sequences. And that is the whole point! If you need to feed ina nd consider a bunch of extra information, the filter becomes little more than a biased propaganda tool. Korthof's devastating critique points out that Dembski cannot even provide a specification for any sequence of DNA - which is required by the 'filter' - so any results are specious. \n \n In the end, does it matter? He has yet to publish his application of the filter to a bacterial flagellum - considering his arbitrary assignments of bits and such, I can see why - and even if he had, in order to do so requires an utterly biased and arbitrary set of constraints that would renders the filter's output meaningless. And here you are, carrying on as if I had claimed that van Gogh had never really cut his ear off....\n You are just churning away, afraid to admit that you have been misled by yet another creationist hero.\n\n \n However, in post 33 this same writer says \"Funny - there is no mention of an actual specific instance in which this 'filter' has worked, much less been applied to, biological phenomena.\"\n \n Well, if it hasn't been applied, then if couldn't be shown to work.\n\n Indeed, especially since it does not work. Do you understand the difference between hypothetical and empirical?\n\n \n It would be easy to prove this poster wrong, if he actually read the reference I gave.\n\n \n I did, it seems that you did not.\n \n But let's say for the sake of argument that Dembski did apply his filter to DNA, using REALISTIC criteria. YOUR own links, in fact, demonstrate that the filter is inapplicable for a variety of reasons.\n One really has to wonder why you would spend - waste - so much energy trying to fight this losing battle.",

A small shift again of the argument.\n \n \n However, because I'm trying to educate you I suggest your read the following.\n \n \"In the actual encounter, Dembski began by overviewing his methods for design detection as developed in The Design Inference. He then  sketched how these methods apply to biology  and why he thought they provided in-principle objections to undirected natural causes, including Kauffman's self-organizational processes, generating the key item that his methods detect, namely, specified complexity or complex specified information. Dembski developed his argument as follows: the only way for self-organizational, Darwinian, and other naturalistic methods to generate specified complexity is by in essence dissolving the actual complexity (or improbability). What seems highly improbable is therefore no longer improbable once one knows the right naturalistic process. Dembski indicated that there were good reasons to think that no such reduction of complexity or improbability would be possible in the case of systems like the bacterial flagellum.  He also adverted to some of the techniques developed in his forthcoming book titled \"No Free Lunch\" for computing the probabilities of discrete combinatorial objects like the bacterial flagellum. \"\n http://www.arn.org/docs/pjweekly/pj_weekly_011119.htm\n \n This suggests that a book is about to appear mysteriously out of the ether...\n \n So, go read the book  \"No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased Without Intelligence\". Unless you think it's not 'published'.\n Oh, look it has been published! It's a miracle.\n \n \n As far back as post 29 the answer was provided for one and all by SLP who wrote:\n \"Unfortunately, Dembski and his \"explanatory\" filter are more hot air than substance. He has claiming to have 'discovered' desing (sic) in nature by using the 'filter', but for some strange reason, he has yet to publish his amazing discovery. he said he was going to do it in \"Mere Creation\", then he said it would be iun (sic)  No Free Lunch  - so tell us , IS IT actually in his newest collection of apocryphal tall tales, or is is (sic) just assumed that he has done so?\"\n \n The simple answer is 'yes he has'.\n \n This mystery book exists. It's even been criticised by people on your side \"In his book, No Free Lunch,  Dembski presents the bacterial flagellum as the premier example of a biological system that, because he judges it to be both complex and specified, must have been actualized by the form-conferring action of an unembodied intelligent agent. However, a critical examination of Dembski?s case reveals that, 1) is is built  on unorthodox and inconsistently applied definitions of both ?complex? and ?specified,? 2) it employs a concept of the flagellum?s assembly that is radically out of touch with contemporary genetics and developmental biology, and 3)  it fails to demonstrate  that the flagellum is either ?complex? or ?specified? in the manner required to make his case. If the bacterial flagellum is supposed to demonstrate ID, then ID is a failure.\"\n http://www.iscid.org/ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=000057;p=\n \n As I said, people on your side are out there criticising him all the time. How could they unless he had published?\n \n Also, it is one thing to say that he hasn't attempted to apply the filter, then to say that he has attempted to apply it and failed.\n \n ;) Game, set and match",

If so, provide the citation. Otherwise Dembski has as much credibility as Von Daniken's chariots of the gods.\n\n \n Firstly my claim was only that he had published it. You all berated and badgered me now for some days over this. I made no claim above this... because I 'suspect' that he has actually done this. I don't 'know' that he has.\n \n But as to what SLP wrote...We are now both having to second guess what SLP means, because what he said was that he had not published period! The inference was clear that he thought Dembski was afraid.\n \n It has been published. It has been applied. As far as I'm concerned this should be the end of this distracting issue.\n \n You mentioning of von Daniken is irrelevant. And, quite frankly is a red-herring. The fact that Dembski has been published means that he is laying his ideas on the table - not hiding them as alleged. The fact that scientists of all shades can pick this up and criticise it - and in fact have also circumvents your smears. I know you'd like to weave this mist of deceit around Dembski too; looking for a sign of scandal where there isn't one; hence you're linking him to von Daniken. It is a poor rhetorical ploy. \n \n Remember that Crick has published in peer-reviews his belief in aliens as the cause of life on earth. Publication does not imply feasibility, therefore not publishing can not imply that something is wrong.\n \n Deep down both you and SLP are clasping at straws by doing this. Rather than actually arguing over the presentation of Dembski you're now seeking not just that he present his argument, not just that he applies it to biological instances, not just that it has been criticised, but that he publishes it in one of your favourite magazines. Not all scientific discourse travels the same path. However you can read Dembski if you want, and disagree with him if you want. My intention on starting this thread was not to discuss the actual merits of Dembski, but to state that there is a growing field of science that is looking for intelligent design.\n \n Most scientist presenting some scientific argument could not in fact have their ideas published in a popular book form because it would be commercially untenable. The fact that Dembski can and does is probably what's really XXXXXXX you off. But likewise, if Barnes & noble carry it, it doesn't imply ridiculousness. You actually sound very much like someone supporting high art funding over sport. If it's popular it's dirty!\n \n However, I said earlier that I suspect that he has published in a journal. As far as I'm aware Dembski continually publishes for an Intelligence Design journal; would this be 'peer reviewed'? I have stated elsewhere the difficulty faced by people on my side from getting things published in other journals and periodicals.\n \n \nBTW, this is not switching the onus of proof, as you try to portray it. You originally made the assertion \"William Dembski has come up with the \"Explanatory Filter\" to determine if something is a natural occurring event, or not.\" True, he has come up with it. But is it correct? Does it actually work? You infer yes to these questionz but you need to provide supporting evidence. Anyone can make unsupported assertions.\n\n \n Sure, I can concede that - I made the statement. I believe however that I have now proved\n a) that he has come up with an Filter\n b) that the filter is used to explain a naturally occurring event\n \n Whether any of you agree that it works is a totally different argument.\n \n SO, now that that's all over we can finally get back to the origins of this entire thread... Looking for Intelligent Design.\n \n Dawkins had claimed that he could find proof of there being no God. He did so by announcing that he'd discovered many things in biology that would appear to be poorly designed.\n \n Ipso facto, if one could find a system 'well designed' it might suggest an intelligence. If Dawkins can do this, then the search for intelligent design is a legitimate pursuit.\n \n Leading onto Dembski who claims that he has come with a Filter that can do just this.\n \n Other scientists look for signs of intelligence...\n Cryptographers look for meaning and patterns in seemingly meaningless groups of information\n \n Forensic scientists look for non-natural causes in death\n \n SETI, similar to cryptographers look for meaning coming from the stars.\n \n All up it seems a perfectly valid pursuit for scientists.\n \n Dembski claims in \"No Free Lunch\" to come up with a series of experiments for scientists to undertake. Excepting as shown by the responses on this post there seems to be a lot of hostility towards such pursuits.",

Apparently, in NFL, he has done this, or at least claimed to, the reviews I have read of it indicate that he did not go into much detail on this, instead regarded the issue as a 'done deal.' Hence the universal skepticism.\n\n \n Has Dembski published his explanatory filter and an application of it to a biological system in a peer reviewed journal? If so, provide the citation. Otherwise Dembski has as much credibility as Von Daniken's chariots of the gods.\n \n BTW, this is not switching the onus of proof, as you try to portray it. You originally made the assertion \"William Dembski has come up with the \"Explanatory Filter\" to determine if something is a natural occurring event, or not.\" True, he has come up with it. But is it correct? Does it actually work? You infer yes to these questionz but you need to provide supporting evidence. Anyone can make unsupported assertions.\nIndeed. Ironically, Monty has linked ot several devastating critiques of Dembski's work, and does so for reasons that I cannot fathom. He seems to think that if he can prove me wrong on whether or not it has been 'published' that it will somehow be a plus for anti-evolutionism.\n \n Strange indeed....",

Like 'what sort of person provides evidence against his argument'?\n \n ** \"Evil be to him who thinks evil.\" It stems from a dinner held by Edward I. A lady dropped her garter. Edward bent down to roll it back up her leg. He then noticed a number of lewd looks from onlookers who all imagined he was doing it for other reasons. He had in fact just wanted to be chivalrous, but when he realised that people were thinking the act evil, he said \"Honi soit qui mal y pense.\"\n Edward then established a fraternity of knights, still in existence today, the Knights of The Garter.",
