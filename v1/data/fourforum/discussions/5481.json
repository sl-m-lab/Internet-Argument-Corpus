   "AV and security consultants bidding on providing those services for our new home are telling me to go wireless, in other words forget having it hard wired for low voltage requirements. While initial costs are about the same, I'm being told the trend for current and most future technology for these applications, residential, is all wireless. \n \n I'm inclined to agree with the presentations, but thought I'd ask the board for opinions.\n \n TIA",

   "What are the chances of interference affecting the transmission quality? Or for the security system to be remotely hacked with the wireless tech?\n\n \n I've been told interference is normally not an issue for residences because they're (this one anyway) wood construction. US commercial buildings, with their steel framing requirements, present interference problems and most are hard-wired. The house isn't all that big and I was also told signal reception would be tested and repeaters installed for any 'dead' areas. I'd been using wireless to split cable Internet signal in our prior home for three years. That home had a detached guest house approx 50' from the main dwelling and the signal went through four interior and two exterior walls without interference. \n \n All anyone intent on hacking it would have to do is determine the frequency used and jam that without bothering to break software security. But wireless works the same as hard-wired security systems in that system interruption sounds an alarm and sends a cellular telephone signal to the monitoring agency resulting in a cell number (mine) called for verification. The former common burglar tactic of cutting telephone lines to disable security systems is no longer an issue. I've also been advised to have the contractor install incoming high voltage and telephone in a secure manner inside the dwelling. Utilities will all be underground from a remote trunk. The security system will be on a stand-alone PC for intrusion sensors and cameras.\n \n The security people both told me that if a pro targets us, very unlikely in our remote location, they still can't bypass the cellular signal. And if someone persists and we're home, the US still allows citizens to be well armed. If we're not home, that's insurance coverage. \n \n The joy of living in the land of the free with deep-seated social ills.",

   "You need to consider the risks of having your connection hi-jacked by neighbours. It is very easy to do, but it is also rather easy to protect the connection. But no doubt, there are always ways around the protection. I have wireless connection, and there are some benefits (being able to surf on the net while enjoying summer-afternoon sun on the balcony is probably the greatest), but I`m not sure that it is worth it. My friend on the other hand has no internet connection at all, but hi-jacks his neighbour. And this guy is hardly a computer-wizz.\n \n It`s no biggie as long as the one who hijacks your connection isn`t engaged in criminal activities on the net.. But if he is, you could end up in a truck-load of problems...\n \n Edit: Hmmm... you`re not talking about wireless internet connection? Hehe... Sorry Georged. Ignore my comments :p",

   "My house is all wireless. As eddie says, if you live in town, wirelass CAN be a bad thing, since it makes it easy for people to hijack your connection. I went to my borthers house a while back in Overland Park (ks) and was goignt o log on and check my Email. I brought up my laptop and went to connect to his wireless network and there were 4 different wireless entworks available. I asked \"which is yours\". He said \"doesn't matter....just pick one\".\n \n If you are out in the sticks, though, wireless is fine, and plenty secure. \n \n One thing you may consider when purchasing equipment is ability to connect an external antenna. The computers in our guest house and shops all needed external antennaes. They guest house is only 200' fromthe house, but could not get a decent signal. Added an additional antennae to the wireless router there (the wireless router in the guest house connects to the network in the main house as well as servicing the shops) and got a great signal. My shops are all metal wall covered with nova brick. I could not get anything on the computers in there, until I added external antennaes. I did not even have to run them to the outside, the antennaes are just sitting on top of the computer cabinets. Moral of the story is the antennaes that come with that stuff are junk, make sure you can add a good one if you need to.",
