I know that science is fairly certain that some observed bodies have a black hole at their center, but it is the electromagnetic radiation that they emit (not just light) that fits the theory of how electromagnetic radiation from matter falling into a black hole should appear that confirms the presence.\n \n If a naked singularity has been observed then it is a surprise to me. I'm sure that Thorn and Hawking would be most interested in this too. I thought that naked singularities were theoretical (in the scientific sense).\n \n And of course the speed of light is variable. Lots of things can effect it - the medium through which it travels and gravity are two. But it never travels faster than the speed of light - always slower. In fact, light passing from one medium to another changes speed according to the wavelength. We can thank this little fact of physics for the rainbow.\n \n And all of this is consistant with a very old universe. The creationist concept of changing light speed is limited to it slowing down so that events from 13.7 billiion years ago really happened about 6,000 years ago. Besides that fact that measurable events that we know take a fixed time that we observe from far away take the took the expected time. An example is the decay of Co-57 and C0-56 in SN 1987 A that took place about 170,000 years ago.

You are now going 90% the speed of light, but to you only a few minutes have past, but because of the whole physics thing, years have passed on earth. Going back, that means that every second to you, is lets saw 1 year to everybody else in the univesre. That is what would happen if we went that fast. \n \n Second, when did time begin- \n \n if we understand the above then time began when time could be percived. If the above is true then percepition is everything, and the relationship between the observer and the obsered breaks down. \n \n Its easier to ask yourself one simple question, when was up and down created, when was left and right born, when did back and forth get started? The answer is simple, until people, roughly as smart or smarter then us were invented up and down, left and right, back and forth, linear time, did not exist. they existed, but not as we know them today. it is really hard to grasp and requires alot of Einstien's transindental thinking, but this plain of existance did not exist until someone observed it. Don't ask me why, I read all the sceince jornals and the articles, read the books and took the classes, and the answer is proabably in my mind somewhere but i can't remember. I'll tell you guys if i remeber (or girls).\n \n Summed up-Time didn't exist until us, or people like us, got here\n \n tell me what you think!",

   "Picture a swamp that is infinitly wide. In this swamp, if something in the swamp looked backward, forward, left or right, he could see backward, forward, left or right. This was fine, until someone (us) needed to go through the swamp from one end to the other. They became seperate and waged through the swamp at a steady rate, until they get to the other side (which will never happen). Although the swamp around them still exists, the thing trying to cross the swamp sees the swamp in terms of a straight line. Were in reality for other things in the swamp who can still go left or right, the thing going through the swamp at the steady rate can only see the swamp in terms of point A and Point B, and the distance inbetween the points. This creates a plane of existance in which the thing going across the swamp sees the swamp (a.k.a. time) as linear. This linear version of the swamp (a.k.a. time) is now the standerd reference for the thing going across the swamp. Any variations from this standerd model will confuse the thing crossing the swamp. I hope this wasn't too abstract. \n \n So the asnwer to the question of when did time begin is this. It began when we got here, when we started our journey across the swamp. Our version of time began the second we got here. And the universal version of time (way, way diffrent then our version) began back infinity years (if you need me to explain this part say so) and continues outside our own version. \n \n P.s.

   "Draconis re: How I Understand Time, \n \n I also enjoy physics, and have a huge stack of new physics books upstairs,\n and a neat physics encyclopedia that I know the answer is in...but I'd rather take a shot at it, and be wrong, and learn from someone who can come up with a definitive answer. Lest I get up off my lazy XXX, and grab that book and type it out for us.\n \n Anyway... I know that time stops at light speed. And one of the neat little threads I often put up in Science Forums is how you can travel 100,000 light years instantaneously. Actually, you can be at ANY point in the universe SIMULTANEOUSLY, and instantly, when you are travelling at light speed.\n \n But, I'm just avoiding answering the question... When does time stop.\n \n OK. My understanding of time is that it exists in any \"system\" in which the most elementry particles of matter are in motion.\n \n What I also recall is that the condition necessary For Time To Stop...is an infinitely large (inward) gravitational force towards a single point, such as inside a Black Hole.\n \n What I recall about When Time Stops....is when all matter is at complete rest... i.e. no electrons are weaving around, nothing in or outside that matter is in motion, nor vibrating... (the in motion part I'm not sure of... if it includes in motion relative to all other matter in the universe, or in motion relative to the \"system\" being considered. My guess is the latter for a limited \"system\", but the former, if speaking of the time for the entire universe.)\n \n So it is my understanding that if the system you are referring to is just a specific Black Hole, then inside that Black Hole, Time has stopped...\n However, if we are speaking of the entire Universe, as the \"system\" under consideration for when time stops.... Then we are talking about when all the matter in the Universe has gathered together into a single \"mass\", so that no matter exists outside of it, and again, there is a Big Black hole...\n But.. my understanding is that there is at least one theory that believes it is possible that when all of the matter in the Universe collapses (if it ever does collapse again), that it may undergo a phase transition into pure energy, as I understand it, it's would be like some kind of light, and energy plasma with a huge amount of heat, and then that stuff transitions again into matter, explodes in the Big One, and POOF, Time Starts again.\n \n Anyway...that's as best as I can recall it...UNLESS you are Travelling at Light Speed, in which case Time Will Stop, for you.\n \n I also recall one other thing, that Einstein's equation E=M*C^2\n Is not a correct representation of Einstein's ACTUAL Equation, and that\n the equation is actially: E=Mzero*C^2 \n And that the M (subscript zero) refers to Rest Mass, Mass at Rest, whatever,\n but not the same thing as when we mistakenly write Einstein's \n equation as: E=M*C^2\n \n All of this stuff is from memory, and as I said, I've not yet had time to get into the Physics stuff too deeply.. I'm currently working my way into higher mathematics... which I got another ton of super books on...And that's gonna take me a few years, before I get through all of it, and into Physics! LOL!!!",

Kind of Paradoxial, if time is stopped, then all time is happening in that point, because with no time, the period between the brith of the blackhole and the fazing out of the black hole is non-existant, so the singularity cannot exist outside of time, or it wouldn't be capable of surviving, but if it didn't get created it wouldn't be able to destroy itself, but if it....and around we go! Or does it? A little help here please!\n \n And you kinda proved my point their freind! If you went the speed of light, to you no time would pass, and you could go anywhere instantly. But to everybody else, you would be only be going 300,000 k/m a second and it would take you billions of years to go across the galaxy. But what if that point at the speed of light were no time exists, because time has stopped, could be, as i think you missed, the standerd model of the universe, at which that every point is open, and every second is accesiable.

It may be the order of law in this perception of the space-time world, but at the speed of light (the universal constant) another perception is achieved in which we get infinite regression.

As you know, motion is also called \"change\". This \"change of something\" can be matter, energy or space. If there is no change - then there is no time, and obviously - no motion.\n \n If you were in a completely dark abyss of space, with no light anywhere, how would you know which way is left or right, up or down, forwards or backwards? The first three dimensions are what we make them, and so is the fourth - time. All it is, is that we've organized time. Our days and years are relative to the orbit of the earth around the Sun.

In one \"system\" we're talking about time stopping due to in infinite gravitational effect, as in a Black Hole, whereas in the other \"system\" we're talking about something that has not stopped, nor under the influence of infinite gravitational pull, but instead time is stopping at light speed, which is the exact opposite of time stopping when all matter (on a subatomic level) is totally at rest. ...

However, I think (and I could be wrong about this), that most physicists believe that Black Holes do not eminate any energy. So, \n I wanted to point out that at the top of your post, you referred to a Black Hole eminating radiation. I think that most physicists would say that what you are saying is not possible, because nothing, not even light can escape, nor be eminated from a Black Hole, excepting \"gravitational waves\" that have only recently been confirmed by a Scientific discovery. (See the BBC Web Site in their Science section.)\n \n The 2nd thing is that your point about time being relative, and my question that I like to pose about travelling instantly to any point in the Universe...\n Your point is not lost on me... That point is the exact reason that I post that little brain teaser, and so far, not 1 person has come up with the correct answer to it. LOL!!!!!

Presumably creating this first time machine will fulfill the creation of one side of the wormhole so that other time machines in the future will be able to link to it.\n \n As far as using speed time travel forward in time, wouldn't traveling beyond the speed of light at least let you see into the past? Assuming you could travel twice the speed of light for 10 years and somehow were able to view objects that were 20 light years away with clarity, then you could see what was happening on Earth in 1993. If you extend this far enough you could see back to the earliest days of the Earth. Of course traveling over the speed of light is supposedly impossible so maybe the 'folding space' idea would have to be used in it's place.\n\n \n \n \n yes...einstien has proved seeing into the future as possible, it is just a matter of money....but actually travel anywhere in time would go against einstiens theory of relativity..... as in, as in if someone came here from the future today, they would show up out of no where, and be created from nothing.something can not be creatd from nothing. ya hear?",

I believe that time started about 6,000 years ago.\n \n As to your question about there being a \"time without time\", I am not quite sure that I follow. It is a screwy question.
