   "Quote from the Great Ronald Reagan\n \n \"Abortion Is Advocated Only By Persons Who Have Themselves Been Born\"\n\n I assume you are quoting this statement since you think that pro-choice proponents are hypocritical in allowing for abortion, where they themselves have benefited from the fact that abortion did not happen in their case.\n \n The thing that you forget is that there are innumerable things that had to happen for any of us to exist - including not getting aborted. For example, if contraception had been used, we also would not have existed. Does that mean that we should outlaw all contraception? If our parents had never met or had sex when they did, we would not exist. Does that mean that we should force couples to have as many children as they possibly can since each unfertilized egg could be a real person whose chances you are squashing? I say no to those two scenarios, just as I say no to a woman being forced to carry a pregancy in the first two trimesters. Just because something is beneficial to someone doesn't mean it should be enforced by law. I am glad that my parents did not abort me, just as I am glad that they did not use contraception, met and had sex when they did, etc. That does not mean that I would have thought it immoral if none of those things had happened.",

Abortion itself is an ancient practice, it represents a regression to a point in time where immorality and barbarism reined supreme. It is part of why Rome and Greece fell, and eventually the elimination of such evil practices brought the barbarians to become civilized.\n \n The only ancient culture to find the disrespect of children disgusting was the Israelites as commanded by God himself. The elimination of the moral depravity of the ancient empires and the barbarians led to the creation of our modern world. While history looks like an ugly thing if one studies it, the results haven't been half bad. \n \n When one studies the bible you will find a very enlightening document when taken as a whole. It gives wisdom in such small space and so understandably to the average person that whole new areas of government and research are discovered in a mere sentence. We see that if the wisdom that it gives us is applied to the modern world, with the exception of laws that are irrelevant and a few reductions in sentences, we will all live wonderful lives dedicated to improving the lives of the poor, nurturing children, and respect for all people regardless of any other circumstances.

Now admittedly the last is weird, but when was the last time anyone thought to go and eat a deer while living.\n\n I don't see \"no aborting fetuses\" in there. You now have to make the argument that fetuses qualify as murder-able people. Probably be hard considering that children less than one month of age weren't counted as people. And that the penalty for causing a miscarriage was not death but a mere fine, even though the other penalties were an eye for an eye, foot for a foot.\n Oh, and then there's this:14I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.\n \n 15Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.\n \n 16Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.\nFor \"rebelling\" against God, and despite their efforts to be good, God punishes them with -- among other things -- condemning their pregnant women to be ripped open.\n \n I'll fess up.

So, what I said in my first post. Glad to see you've come around.\n \n Really, though, there's so much to say to this.\n The Bible doesn't love children in all circumstances. See the passage above. And happiness is dashing children's heads upon rocks (Proverbs).\n First, I can think of many names to call you for asserting with no evidence that those who have abortions do not love children. I'm just not allowed to use any of those names here.\n If it's not your problem that she doesn't follow the alleged teaching of the Bible, why should you care what she does? As evidenced by your ranting here, the fact is that you've taken it upon yourself to take issue with the situation, and for you to pretend otherwise shows just how out of touch with reality you are.

God gets to do it, but (according to you) tells others not to? So God's a hypocrite?\n \n \nGod is only causing abortions inadvertently in the law, besides those are illegitimate children of married women, she shouldn't have had them anyway. [bold added]\n\n An omniscient, omnipotent, perfect God makes mistakes? Really?\n And you're acknowledging that He is causing abortions, but that it's okay because the fetuses are not of married couples? So you're saying it's okay to abort when the parents aren't married. Good to know.\n Keep digging, buddy. When you do nothing but shovel bovine feces, you just end up in a giant hole.

Read the 11th, 12th and 13th chapters so you have a better understanding of what is going on here.

They returned to the worship of false gods and commiting abortion.\n \n CH 13 vs 12 and 13 : The two verses before your posting,\n \n 12The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.

(abortion)\n \n \n \n This is not the first time God said to destroy everyone, including children. When a group of people were so disgustingly sinful and without remorse, the followers of God were instructed to destroy them all, man , woman , and child. In some cases, even the animals owned by these peoples were to be destroyed. \n \n This is not because God advocates abortion. This is because there was no good in the hearts of these men and woman, they were utterly consumed with their self importance and evil . God did not want this way of life to make it's way into the lives of those that were living according to his word.\n \n Yeah, I know you're gonna make some snide remarks about how could God do that, blah blah blah. God is not stupid, nor are you. The innocent children and unborn will be taken care of by God, and you know it. The reason they were not spared is because if anyone had been spared in this cleansing of evil, that doubt would have crept into those that were following the laws, and this would have happened all over again. An utter and total destruction of those that were a part of this evil lifestyle was the only way that the point could be emphatically made.",

   "Historically, a fetus has never (or very rarely) been considered a human being, at least not before \"quickening\", an old-fashioned term indicating noticeable movement of the fetus. The Catholic Church even allowed abortion until quickening, up until 18694. Further, the wide variety of laws throughout the world were written specifically to protect born human beings and their property. There is virtually no legal precedent for applying such laws to fetuses5. Even when abortion was illegal, it had a lesser punishment than for murder, and was often just a misdemeanor6. The anti-choice view of fetuses as human beings is therefore a novel and peculiar one, with little historical or legal precedent to back it up.\n \n Fetuses are uniquely different from born human beings in major ways, which casts doubt on the claim that they can be classified as human beings. The most fundamental difference is that a fetus is totally dependent on a woman's body to survive. Anti-choicers might argue that born human beings can be entirely dependent on other people too, but the crucial difference is that they are not dependent on one, specific person to the exclusion of all others. Anybody can take care of a newborn infant (or disabled person), but only that pregnant woman can nurture her fetus. She can&#8217;t hire someone else to do it.\n \n Another key difference is that a fetus doesn't just depend on a woman's body for survival, it actually resides inside her body. Human beings must, by definition, be separate individuals. They do not gain the status of human being by virtue of living inside the body of another human being&#8212;the very thought is inherently ridiculous, even offensive. \n \n Personhood: Is a Fetus a Human Being?",

The cheeseburger you had for lunch was more sentient at one time then a newborn is. I don't entertain some cutesy notion about adorable little babes being something more than what they actually are.\n\n \n Actually I do remember my early childhood. I have at least 3 distinct memories from before I was one year old. These were all confirmed. \n \n The average person doesn't have memories before 3 years old. This is partially due to what's called the \"recency effect\" in psychological terms. The recency effect is the tendency for people to remember the most recent (in say a list of words or numbers or anything that involves the memory). You couldn't possibly remember every single moment of your life because it is too much and your brain has to make room for other things (the ability to carry out the body's functions without thinking about it, the ability to comprehend language, sensory perception, etc., etc.). You couldn't possibly remember everything that happened in your day, even the day it's happening. Your memory gets less clear the further you move away from that event. \n \n So does that mean because 2 weeks from now or 2 years from now since you won't have the full memory of every moment of your life (in fact, very little of it) then you can be said to have been dead and therefore not a human being or person?\n \n Like wise with a baby, even an unborn one. Does that mean it's ok to kill a child before 3 because he supposedly has no memories of the previous 3 years? \n \n And what about the child in the womb? That makes it ok to kill them too because they supposedly have no memories. \n \n But then how do explain newborn infants preferring to be swaddled for several months after birth? Because they simply love being confined and wrapped up or because it reminds them of when they were in the womb? \n \n Just in case you were wondering, those questions were rhetorical. Obviously you wouldn't really think that... would you?\n \n \nYou say but what about the potential that this \"person\" could grow up to be the next great president of the United States or a scientist that discovers a cure for cancer? That argument fails to acknowledge that it's infinitely more likely that an unwanted child will have severe problems through out it's entire life and will likely become a criminal and/or murderer and/or a drug addict and the list goes on.\n\n \n Sure, there's potential for either. Statistically you may be right. Does that mean those children who were born and lived under neglectful or abusive circumstances should be killed because they're statistically more likely to become something society deems unacceptable? The fact is, the potential remains for either case and there's no way we'd be able to know unless we allow them to live in the first place. \n \n \nThink about those two words, unwanted child, that is what should horrify you, why aren't you doing anything about that?\n\n \n I have thought about those two words and yes, it does horrify me. \n \n It horrifies me for two major reasons: 1) the fact that people use the term unwanted CHILD means that they recognize it as a child before it's born and still choose to abort it. 2) and the fact that there are people so callous and selfish as to not give the child their right to life because they don't want to be responsible for the consequences of their actions.

   "Since when is it solely the responsibility of the woman to not spread her legs? All throughout history men protected women they cared about from the coercive manipulative tactics of other men. A fourteen year old girl is no more capable of saying no to a guy she really likes than she is capapble of responsibly owning a gun or voting or any number of other things we donSt allow her to do under the age of 18.\n So why aren't the men held responsible for their part in the cycle of abortion? It took two people to make that fetus, alive and soul imbibed or otherwise, and yet its the women who are getting spit on and cursed at and suffering outside the abortion clinic. How many men who said \"I'm not taking care of YOUR baby\" did it take to send those women there?\n My husband and I are waiting til we're more financially stable to have children, but if we screwed up tomorrow he would be there for me and my baby and so I would not need an abortion. Other women aren't so lucky. You can't force them into a life of poverty desperately trying to get by on 75% of the male dollar until you force the men who helped put them there to do the same. You don't want to kill the babies, but you also refuse to take care of them once they're here. And just to dispell the argument that's sure to be made in favor of child support now, the average child receiving child support in america today recieves less than is necessary just to have somewhere to live and to eat, let alone live a full and happy life with all the opportunities of their peers. My source? My own crappy dad left my two half sisters with their mom in california to grow up on welfare and not afford college, he ducked the child support by moving states and getting a new job everytime the wage garnishment kicked in. \n My point is this, if you don't want people to get abortions, make it unnecessary for them to want one. Harsher legistlation on deadbeat dads, more money towards single mothers who choose not to abort, and programs to help newborns get adopted faster. In the meantime, unless you want to take responsibility for my hospital bills and baby formula dn diapers and college tuition and clothes etc. Keep the law out of it.",

   "I would like to first thank you for your very fair and understanding (no sarcasm, I mean it) reply to my argument towards societal responsibility for unwanted and similarly unaborted children. Its nice to have a civilized conversation on the internet without being trolled for once. I would also like to clarify my point on the responsibility of men in this case.\n I don't mean to say that men are in any way subject to the responsibilities of having an abortion. You are correct in saying that since it isn't their choice to get one or not. But the responsibility lies in the area of conception. The man helped conceive the fetus by offering the sperm, 50% of that action is on his part and of his own accord. So while it is the womans choice whether to allow that act to come to fruition by allowing the pregnancy and birth to occur rather than having an abortion, one has to ask when she chooses the latter, why? Why does she feel that she has no other option? I don't know for sure the statistics on this but I would bet my right to choose that nine times out of ten it is because her sex partner refused to step up and be a father and provider, in spite of the fact that it was half his doing. I myself had a pregnancy scare when I was very young and the first word out of HIS mouth was abortion. He literally said \" you have to get an abortion christine, I just can't do this right now\". He just couldn't do it? I got lucky, the test was wrong. So many others didn't get that second chance. And so many others got that same sentence out of the man that knocked them up, by half.\n So I ask again, why aren't the men held responsible for the need of abortion? If the men don't say \"don't worry about it baby, I'll get on the hunt for a job first thing in the mroning, let's go talk to your folks\" then what signal does that send to the women? It says well honey I helped put it there but since I'm not carrying the thing for the next nine months its your problem. When did it come to be that a man can get away with that kind of arrogant misogynistic immoral behavior? Back in the day if you did that, the girls daddy would hunt you down right after your parents disowned you and your pastor banished you.\n Just because a man doesn't carry a pregnancy doesn't leave him without responsibility.I say again, you can't have no abortions without legal ramifications for the other parties. Instead of making abortions illegal, take away the need to get one. Hold the sperm donor equally responsible for caring for parenting and for the 18 years and nine months of bills and I guarantee you'll see a drastic decline in the number of abortions in this country.\n Its the same way you teach a child not to stick a fork in an electrical outlet, by making the ramifications of doing it more terrifying than the curiosity factor is interesting.\n Solve the abortion problem by making it unnecessary before making it illegal. By telling women, \"you don't need to get an abortion because you won't have to do this alone and the police and the entire justice system will back you up when the first word out of HIS mouth is not my problem\". If a woman knows she has the might of the judiciary branch at her back to make sure she isn't bound to a life of abject backbreaking poverty, she won't get her baby aborted. If a man knows he'll be held criminally responsible and monetarily responsible for ditching his pregnant lover, he'll be less inclined to put a baby there in the first place.",

For example, if contraception had been used, we also would not have existed. Does that mean that we should outlaw all contraception? If our parents had never met or had sex when they did, we would not exist. Does that mean that we should force couples to have as many children as they possibly can since each unfertilized egg could be a real person whose chances you are squashing? I say no to those two scenarios, just as I say no to a woman being forced to carry a pregancy in the first two trimesters. Just because something is beneficial to someone doesn't mean it should be enforced by law. I am glad that my parents did not abort me, just as I am glad that they did not use contraception, met and had sex when they did, etc. That does not mean that I would have thought it immoral if none of those things had happened.\n\n I don't particularly want to get involved in abortion debates but this particular equivocation really bugs me.\n \n The equivocation being that abortion is merely and only in a category 'things that need to happen'.\n \n It is essentially different then even sex because it is a positive action to accomplish the definite end of a life. You have simply tacked on a negative and put it into the inverse category for convenience.\n \n Not throwing your entire life's effort into creating more life is no equivalent to intentionally ending it and making that comparison is just utter absurdity.\n \n The equivocation taken to it's logical extremes would hold that murdering a 40 year old is no tragedy because that 40 year olds parents might never have decided to have sex.\n \n You can see this by merely extending the inversion of category as you have.\n \n \"The thing that you forget is that there are innumerable things that had to happen for any of us to exist - including not getting murdered.\"\n \n You can't deny that non-murder is required for life.\n \n \"For example, if a meteor had struck someone, they also would have ceased to exist.\"\n True, but that doesn't mean that if you target someone with a giant meteor machine you didn't murder them.\n \n You cannot tear down a building that has not been built yet that is essentially what you are comparing abortion to.

If this happened, then buildings would likely be destroyed all the time either because there was an intrinsic flaw in the plan or because the builders realized that it really didn't fit together the way they wanted. This being the case, is it 'a building' as soon as ground is broken? Or does it qualify as 'a building' only partway through it's construction? Or is it truly 'a building' only once the construction is finished? \n \n The 'natural' destruction because the project couldn't bear it's own weight or the decision to destroy the project by the builders is a somewhat equivalent danger to the finished building.

   "I know that's your point, but I think your analogy does it a disservice.\n \n If a construction project followed the same chronology of the fetus, then buildings would begin construction the instant the blueprint was drawn up. If this happened, then buildings would likely be destroyed all the time either because there was an intrinsic flaw in the plan or because the builders realized that it really didn't fit together the way they wanted. This being the case, is it 'a building' as soon as ground is broken? Or does it qualify as 'a building' only partway through it's construction? Or is it truly 'a building' only once the construction is finished? \n \n The 'natural' destruction because the project couldn't bear it's own weight or the decision to destroy the project by the builders is a somewhat equivalent danger to the finished building. Both are something it has to survive. It's a fatalistic \"the cost of doing business\" kind of view.\n\n The analogy had nothing to do with whether a later decision to destroy the building is proper or not or even whether it happened or not.\n \n I gave a couple other analogies because you were obviously focusing on the wrong parts, the only crucial part of the analogy is that something didn't exist, then it did, and there was a phase of construction in between.\n \n \n \nExactly where the tipping point is might be opaque to us, but that does not mean that there is no difference between point A and point B. Even calling it an organism is a stretch, since an organism typically is a complete thing in and of itself (or at least reasonably close). \n\n Tipping point? What are you talking about there isn't a gradient birth is a process.\n \n That's like saying there is a definite difference between making a dough and taking bread out of the oven, there has got to be some tipping point.\n \n A tipping point between what and what?\n \n \nSince there are some things we can destroy without morality being involved (such as our hypothetical building) we would have to determine if what is being destroyed is worthy of our moral attention.\n \n\n If one wanted to argue that it is moral or a-moral (essentially the same). The issue at hand is that a fallacy was committed when destruction is equivocated with prevention of existance. That was what I am arguing right now.",
