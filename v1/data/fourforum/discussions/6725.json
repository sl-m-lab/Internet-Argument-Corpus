A majority of anti-choice posts I've read are essentially based on their 2000 year-old mythical belief system, when women were not considered a particularly valuable portion of society for tasks other than child bearing and scullery purposes. Unless, of course, capable of immaculate conception, still unproven, yet enjoying dogmatic status. If you refute those mythical beliefs, regardless of any country's constitution, to those posters you're actually less than a piece of real estate and definitely non-human, male or female.",

Just like the woMAN can deny the fetus care via an abortion the woMAN should be allowed to supply care for the fetus as long as she wishes to...even if this is beyond 9 months. And I am not talking about outside the womb here!!! If the woMAN has the choice then can she make it so the baby is just supported off of her body for as long as she desires? Maybe we could attach the fetus to her leg or something. If the woMAN has full control over this inferior creature then shouldn't she be allowed to do this? (By allow I mean legally)\n \n Before you even answer, I will say this arguement I present seems...well...crazy. In fact, I would think many feel the same way, however, if one wishes to allow choice then how can one see it any other way? I'll tell you how. Someone will say \"well the baby forces itself out and thus becomes a person\". I think maybe we should force the baby to stay in there if the woman wishes. Or maybe it really isn't all about the woman. Maybe it really is about when the unborn is enough of a person to override the desires of the woman.

And I am not talking about outside the womb here!!! If the woMAN has the choice then can she make it so the baby is just supported off of her body for as long as she desires? Maybe we could attach the fetus to her leg or something. If the woMAN has full control over this inferior creature then shouldn't she be allowed to do this? (By allow I mean legally)\n\n Jito, you have been pregnant and given birth; I, also, have been pregnant and given birth. Have you ever longed to prolong the pregnancy in the way that Steeeeeve postulates so that you may have \"full contol over this inferior creature\"?\n \n Honest to God, such a thing is something that only a man could dream up! One wonders, indeed, if the man hadn't been smoking something funny.\n \n When one nears the end of one's pregnancy, one longs for delivery from the enormous discomfort. That has been my experience. I presume that you, also, felt this way. But, perchance, did you have an insane desire to continue the pregnancy in some way--even the rididulous way that Steeeeeve postulates in order to have \"full contol over this inferior creature\"",

Someone will say \"well the baby forces itself out and thus becomes a person\". I think maybe we should force the baby to stay in there if the woman wishes. Or maybe it really isn't all about the woman. Maybe it really is about when the unborn is enough of a person to override the desires of the woman. If it is the second one then we really aren't talking about imposing \"compulsory gestation and forced parturition on women\" as suggested by simone and Howard Beale but rather when a human is worthy of life which is the real question.\n",
