   "Click Here To See The Picture Show\n \n A couple of weeks ago Pastor Scott Borden (Click here to check out his sermons) talked to us about this subject. I WON'T steal all his thunder. If you want the whole sermon check out his website. I think this messages was given on February 3, 2008.\n \n Anyway humans unlike GOD are slow learners. Especially, when doing the RIGHT THING requires some sacrifice. To illustrate his point Pastor Scott read us a SHORT BOOK.\n \n CHAPTER 1 -- Walking down the street a man falls into a hole. He DOESN'T know where he is, so it takes him a long time to climb out of the hole.\n \n CHAPTER 2 -- The next day the man walks down the SAME STREET and falls into the SAME HOLE. This time he knows where he is so he gets out of the hole faster.\n \n CHAPTER 3 -- The next day the man walks down the SAME STREET and sees the SAME HOLE but still falls in. He still knows where he is and is able to get out really quick.\n \n CHAPTER 4 -- The next day the man walks down the SAME STREET and sees the SAME HOLE but walks around it.\n \n CHAPTER 5 -- The next day the man takes a different rout. The end.\n \n The man is suppose to symbolize us. The hole in our path is a trap set by the devil. The story documents the fact that we DON'T avoid temptations. We have to get caught in the SAME TRAP several times before we take steps to avoid that temptation. The moral of the story is when satin gets you to sin, you've got to take some time and study the events that lead up to that sin. Then you got to come up with at plan to avoid that situation is the future.\n \n Pastor Scott when on to say, that you have to KNOW YOUR WEAKNESSES. The devil sure does and he's going to exploit them every chance he gets. If you DON'T know what your weaknesses are, then you're going to keep falling into that SAME HOLE (trap)&nbsp;over and over again.\n \n Pastor Scott also said, it's important to know the environments where you are most likely to be convinced to sin. You also need to know if devil finds it easier to tempt you when you're in the company of certain people. And DON'T assume you have a safe place where the devil CAN'T get to you because that'll be the place where it'll happen. Overconfidence is a weakness that the devil will exploit. You CAN'T drop your guard because the devil we be there waiting for the exact moment of weakness.\n \n For the record, I wrote this message based on what I seen, heard and understood during Pastor Scott's sermon a couple of weeks ago. I know this ISN'T everything he said on the subject and the SPIRIT OF GOD surely played a role in producing this version. So DON'T hold Pastor Scott over the coals because of anything I posted here today. This version of his sermon is what I got out of his message, not necessarily what he said and/or meant.",
