I would imagine that if a US official got up and said that a terrorist attack over the holidays was a certainty in Chicago, for example, the place would be a ghost town 24 hours after the warning. \n \n Aren't you guys glad that Blair offered you up as the diversionary target to keep terrorists from attacking the US? Rest assured that if a bunch of sauds and pakistanis kill 3000 or more of you, we are fully prepared to bomb the hell out of Lichtenstein. \n \n Just keep taking our hits for us, and keep tossing billions down the toilet stabilizing the dollar, and we will keep pretending that you are a super power and Blair will keep getting to come to the US for photo ops at Bushs ranch. You can't beat that for a deal.",

You can't beat that for a deal.\n\n \n Yes, as a UK citizen, we have got somewhat used to receiving dire warnings and claims of countless plots beinh thwarted.\n \n Never know what to believe. Unfortunately the government's ability to tell the truth is so abysmally low that it is no wonder all the claims are treated sceptically.\n \n When you add all the deployment of troops to Heathrow etc which most people now believe to be a farce, then we get faced with a real bomb in the July which may be could have been stopped, then the killing of an innocent merely because someone thought he might be a terrorist, you can understand why we are dubious about these claims. \n \n The government here seem to have got into the 'Boy cries Wolf' syndrom. They seem to want us to be frightened so they can impose even more draconian laws on the grounds they are protecting us and we should be really grateful.",

The terrorist plots they heroically stopped are apparently just as imaginary as those stopped by US authorities.\n\n I think the scepticism differs greatly per country and for each topic. \n On the whole I think that the media in Europe are more sceptical than the ones in the US, but that's partially also because we don't have the massive media conglomerates over here as you do over there.\n The people here however are sometimes more sceptical and sometimes less sceptical than their American counterparts. Like I said, it differs greatly per topic. For example, when it became a law here in Holland to always have your ID with you, not a single peep was heard from the population as opposed to more vocal resistance to a similar law in the US.\n \n \nI disagree that we are sliding down a slippery slope to fascism. I can't speak for Europe, but in the US, there is no sliding about it. We are there. What \"rights\" do we have that the italians did not have under mussolini?\n\n In some cases you guys are more ahead in the fascism department, and in some cases it's us.\n European governments do have a lot more data on the people than the Americans. This makes it very hard to disappear from the radar because the government always knows where you live. In the US it's a lot easier to just disappear.\n However, on the other side, the pro-corporation laws in the US are far more radical than the ones in Europe.\n \n \nI doubt that the majority of Americans are fascist, but when Mussolini came to power, the majority of Italians were not facsist either. They were just apathetic and stupid, just like most Americans today. While our version of corporatism is different than what we saw mussolini using, it has simply adapted itself to our current corporate culture. Beyond that, I think we have done a fairly good job of emulating Mussolinis playbook.\n\n Apathy will be the death of all of us. Just look at the mandatory ID law that I mentioned earlier. People don't seem to realise that it now means that they must have government permission and a government mark to be able to walk on the streets that they themselves payed for.\n \n I think that there should be more funding for psychiatric research that investigates collective insanity.\n \n The comparisons with Mussolini's fascist state are also on the mark.\n I find it fascinating (in a kinda sick way) to see how fascism is forming itself compared to the days of Mussolini. Because in Mussolini's era the state took over the corporations and these days the corporations take over the state, but the end result is still the same.\n \n I'm still undecided about whether or not this whole situation can still be turned around and mankind can somehow be salvaged, but when I look at the average voter, I don't have that much hope.",
