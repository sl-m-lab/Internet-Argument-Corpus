   "I am surprised at schools today. I substituted today at a middle school here in Washington D.C. and it was nearing time to go. I asked what major things happened during their Christmas. A kid named Kat Shepherd said, \"I was in juvenile hall over Christmas.\" She and some of these gangster dressed kids laughed and made jokes, and some started talking about how they are on probation.\n My analysis states that kids now a day, are proud of being on probation, or going to juvenile hall. Why the hell would a kid braag about that? This is common sense here people. These are more than likely the kids that will be the thugs running the gangs or taking part in crime in your cities.\n Kids are a little to obsessed with trouble. Not all. In the schools I taught, and schools I substitute in today, a majority of these kids (76 percent) do their homework, and keep their behavior clean. But the rest are wanabee gang bangers.\n Games like Grand Theft Auto teach your kids to be like that. Now, I know that this is a phase in some kids. For god sake, I remember lieing to my high school sweatheart that I was the don of a kid run mafia family. (Kids in Russia I grew up with created their own mafia and so on. I bragged that I was the don, just for attention.) but, that was not true. I was never in a gang. Some of these kids braag or act like they are bad to get attention. But, this is immature and not worth it. Some will grow out of this phase, and some of course, will be the future thugs running the streets.\n -John Mercevov Milosevic",

It's no longer cool to be smart. Heck, take a look at our president.\n \n So, ya gotta have a record to stand out, something you can brag about.\n \n It includes bragging about all the time you've done, the crimes you've committed, the drugs you've done, how drunk you've been--just take a look at our president.

Were there no gangs before that game? I'm sure you think rap causes this too, right? You wanna ban video games and rap? Of course I'm sure you think listening to country music will make you want to drink, buy a truck, and cheat on your spouse, right?\n \n At our school, it's not just kids pretending it or just talking it. There are all kinds of gang fights in our school and in PE one day (while we were changing in the locker room) a kid pulled out a knife and threatened a kid with it. This is unfortunate, but how would you go about changing it? I don't think banning video games would do the trick.",
