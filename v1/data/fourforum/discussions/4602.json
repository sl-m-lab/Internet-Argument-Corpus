   "America's First Pseudo-Communist President, Franklin Roosevelt, Died with American Blood on his Hands\n \n In the early morning of December 4th, 1941, at a US Navy shortwave monitoring station in Cheltenham, Maryland, a half-hour drive southeast of Washington, DC, senior radio operator Ralph Briggs was just coming on duty.\n \n It seemed like an ordinary morning, as he tuned his receiver to the station and began transcribing what he heard. At 8 a.m. he received the message he had been waiting for. It seemed to be nothing more than a regional weather forecast, the kind that the stations he monitored transmitted every day during their news broadcasts. But Briggs, alone among the radio operators at Cheltenham, knew what the three words meant. They meant that the world was going to change in unpredictable but cataclysmic ways. They meant that many of his friends and countrymen would soon be dead. They meant that America would never be the same again. The three words were casually spoken during the regular news and weather feature from Radio Tokyo, Japan. The words were \"East Wind, Rain.\" Briggs immediately teletyped the message to Washington.\n \n \"East Wind, Rain\" was one of three possible \"execute\" messages which Japanese diplomats around the world had been alerted to begin listening for on November 19th. They were told to monitor the regular news and weather broadcasts from Tokyo, just as they always did, but to pay especially careful attention to the phraseology employed to describe the weather.\n \n If they heard the words \"North Wind, Cloudy,\" it meant war with the Soviet Union.\n \n If they heard the words \"West Wind, Clear,\" it meant war with the British Empire.\n \n And if they heard the words \"East Wind, Rain,\" it meant war with the United States.\n \n The Roosevelt government knew the meaning of the \"East Wind, Rain\" message. They knew it because American and British intelligence were able to read the Japanese diplomatic code, and they had intercepted and read the message from the Japanese foreign ministry of November 19th, 1941, which instructed Japanese embassies and consulates to be listening for the \"winds\" execute messages on their shortwave receivers, and which explained the meaning of the messages in no uncertain terms.\n \n Read more:\n \n http://www.natall.com/free-speech/fs951a.html\n \n \n \n .",

Throughout the war, there was a \"Pacific lobby\", led by Admiral King and General MacArthur, that wanted the main weight of the American war effort to be applied in the Pacific theatre of operations. Japan first, then Germany, was their policy. (We would be living in a very different world now if their policy had been adopted).\n \n Hitler's declaration of war against the United States was a folly of immense importance (from the British point of view). From the German point of view, it \"legitimatized\" an all out U-boat attack on American ships bringing supplies that helped to keep Britain in the war. But in any case, it is highly probable that even if Hitler had refrained from acting first, the US would, in 1942, have joined Britain in the struggle against the Nazis. \n \n If the Axis powers had co-ordinated their efforts at the outset in the way you suggest, it is conceivable that Hitler would have won in Europe.

   "Roosevelt knew prior to Pearl Harbor that we were going to be dragged into WWII. He had been exchanging private letters with Churchill long before Churchill even became PM. At that time 85% of the American population was wholly against our entering the war. (It reminded me of Europe with regard to the Iraq war.) Roosevelt campaigned in 1940 (after being drafted to run again) that he would not send our boys off to fight another foreign war. Eleanor Roosevelt told him he made a serious mistake making that claim because it would not be kept. But that was politics.\n \n We knew that Japan would attack us somewhere but Pearl Harbor was not considered to be the target. Prior to that Japan had issued demands on the U.S. that we abandon all our military bases in the Pacific INCLUDING Hawaii. There is even a voice recording of Roosevelt expressing his disbelief at such hubris since it would effectively mean we would give up Hawaii (that later became our 50th state.) \n \n Plans had been drawn up prior to Pearl Harbor and 85% of the force structure was to be given to the European theater. Of course McArthur was appalled but Roosevelt didn't much like him and wanted him to be tied up in the Pacific and out of his hair. Roosevelt selected Eisenhower because of his political skills\n \n Just prior to WWII, we had virtually no military to speak of. We were 15th or 16th in the entire world. Other than Lend Lease we could do very little to help the Brits. That was a brilliant solution by FDR to assist the Brits and was all he could do at that time without being impeached. He did make it clear to the American people that we had to do that or we would be facing the guns next time.\n \n Roosevelt received a 20 page letter from Churchill prior to Pearl Harbor outlining the threats from Hitler. After pondering this letter, Roosevelt was fully committed to the inevitable and Pearl Harbor turned the American population entirely behind the war effort almost overnight from 85% against to almost 100% for. \n \n The sequel to \"Mein Kampf\" outlines the plans that Hitler had for America and he knew that he would have have to defeat America in order to ensure the continuation of his \"Thousand Year Reich.\"",

What you and the conspiracists are arguing is that FDR was able to achieve a level of stragetic and tactical planning that is without precedent with an adversary.\n \n Sorry, reading a few isolated intercepts doesn't allow you to build that kind of time frame.\n \n FDR no doubt knew that Japan was up to no good.

They will lay out for you the names of the people involved.\n \n \nI asked you again but you ignored it so I will repeat: Given Japan's program of aggression, how does the US NOT provoke Japan WITHOUT capitulating?\n\n \n I didn't follow what you meant by \"capitulating\", since prior to the provocation there was no war the US was a part of, no need for them to surrender to anyone to avoid it.\n \n \nIf the US fleet withdrew to the West Coast, that would be an invitation for Japan to attack all of our Pacific possessions, would it not?\n\n \n Probably. A total withdrawal was not neccessary though.\n \n \nAre you suggesting the US should have tried to cut a deal with the Japanese, say offer them the East Indies, Australia and New Zealand if they let us keep what we have?\n\n \n IIRC, the Japanese offered a reasonable deal in exchange for a lifting of the oil embargo, that involved by and large a withdraw of Japanese troops, from China, and certainly US territories like the Phillipines would have been covered by it, though I dont have the exact details handy, and there was the offer to sit down and talk it over. So there wasn't any \"brilliant diplomacy\" required really.\n \n Whether Roosevelt should have taken up such an offer is another matter, but he did want Japan to attack the US, and deliberately took measures to ensure it would.",

   "The source of my comments regarding the eight-point plan is \"Day of Deceit - The Truth about FDR and Pearl Harbor\" by Robert E Stinnett, where a photograph of said document appears.\n\n \n Link please? Sorry, but after the CBS fiasco, I don't simply assume documents are authentic because someone produces a picture of them.\n \n \nHow can he both want an incident (to bring the US into war) and want to deter the Japanese (to keep the US out of war)?\n\n \n Simple: \n \n 1. He recognizes that Japan is bent on a course of aggression and cannot be deterred and \n 2. He wishes to fight before the correlation of forces and strategic resources are in Japan's favor.\n \n There, wasn't that easy?\n \n \nBy this I assume you mean you haven't read it. The provocation desired was to get Japan to attack the US - not China.\n\n \n Nope. I don't buy into a lot of conspiracy XXXX.\n \n But thanks for providing the list.\n \n \n\n \n It involved\n a) A crippling trade embargo on Japan\n\n \n Whoops, have to stop you there. You left out the first two points I already listed:\n \n 1. Put China next to Japan\n 2. Get Japan to attack it.\n \n You need to put at the top of your list: \"So after Japan launches an unprovoked war of imperialist aggression...\"\n \n \n\n b) Supplying military equipment to China under lend-lease\n c) Supplying an air force contingent (of \"mercernaries\" who \"happened\" to all have been in the USAF at the time and were permitted to go fight) flying P40s to the Chinese army, that shot down hundreds of Japanese planes, prior to Pearl Harbour.\n\n \n Right, so the US had a duty to simply recognize Japan's imperialist goals and atrocities in China by not lifting a finger to help a long-time American ally. \n \n Sounds like surrender to me.\n \n But wait, there's more:\n \n \nd) Stationing the fleet at Hawaii.\n\n \n Ah yes, can't provoke anyone by stationing the US military within its own territories...\n \n \ne) Having Naval vessels hang around the very edges of Japanese waters.\n\n \n Ah yes, mustn't **** people off by sailing in international waters or anything.\n \n \nf) Sending messages to the Japanese that implied threats and were essentially ultimatums.\n \n This is despite a \"neutrality\" pact.\n \n\n \n Right. So the US response to Japanese aggression should have been:\n \n 1. Take no action that disturbs Japan in the least, diplomatically or economically.\n 2. Cease any and all US aid to the victims of Japanese aggression.\n 3. Withdraw US forces from international waters around Japan and from US bases thousands of miles from Japan so the Japanese don't have any doubts that we are utterly spineless.\n \n Basically, FDR should have appeased the Japanese until Japan was ready for the next stage of its expansion.\n \n Thanks for clearing that up.\n \n \nFor the details of that, you'll have to read a book by someone who's done the research on it directly. They will lay out for you the names of the people involved.\n\n \n No, thanks, you've done a swell job of summarizing exactly the idiocy of this argument.\n \n And I like your bit that maybe the Japanese would be kind enough not to make us redeploy all of our fleet. How nice of them!\n \n After they conquered and colonize Australia, maybe we could have gotten New Zealand as a consolation prize.",

It certainly hampered Japan's war effort, but that was the point.\n \n Unless you are going to argue that nations have a to sell scrap and oil to imperialists, the US was fully within its rights to decline to support Japan's policies.\n \n Japan's government could have ended the sanctions at any time. In fact, there were many within Japan who favored abandoning their project of conquest and war.\n \n But Japan's military would not be moved.\n \n They were bent on war.\n \n Still, the US had no way of knowing how determined Japan was. So it used a graduated diplomatic, economic and military response because the US and particularly FDR didn't want a two-ocean war.\n \n But once it became clear that Japan was determined to have her conquests, the question was not whether to fight Japan but when.\n \n That is why I believe FDR preferred fighting sooner rather than later.\n \n But that doesn't offer one shred of proof that he set the US up for a surprise attack.\n \n Have you ever studied the British raid on Taranto? Using your logic, Mussolini knew the British were going to strike, why had had to: The Italian fleet was all concentrated, it's aerial defenses were poor and the vigiliance of the defenders was pathetic.\n \n Why I bet there are documents out there, somewhere proving this.\n \n And if there aren't, why it must be because they were destroyed. Yeah, that's the ticket.\n \n This is where conspiracy thinking gets you.\n \n It's sad really that you give such idiocy any credibility. I thought you were a fairly sane fellow.

   "Roosevelt Was A Traitor\n \n Franklin Roosevelt had been Assistant Secretary of the Navy when the Wilson Administration and Winston Churchill tricked us into World War I. Now he was President and he lusted to get the nation into war again. Roosevelt provoked Hitler by waging war without declaring it. For instance, he provided destroyer escorts to English convoys and threatened to sink any U-boats (German submarines) that showed themselves. Roosevelt was hoping to provoke an incident he could use as an excuse to declare war.\n \n Meanwhile, he was running for re-election in 1940 and made the following pledge: \"I say to you fathers and mothers, and I will say it again and again and again, your boys will not be sent into foreign wars.\" Remember that Woodrow Wilson's re-election slogan in 1916, when he was conspiring to trick us into World War I, was \"He Kept Us Out of War.\" Now, in 1940, in the infamous \"again and again\" speech, world government conspirator Franklin Roosevelt was telling the same lie.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.rense.com/general30/worse.htm\n \n New page for \"East Wind, Rain\"\n \n \n \n .",
