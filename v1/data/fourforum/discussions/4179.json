   "You guys didn't look at the first part of the URL - geocities. The site has been around for a long time. It started out offering free sites and I think it still does. You can also get upgraded sites with more disk space at a price. Geocities is now owned by Yahoo. Originally the various geocities domains were divided into \"cities\" and other locations around the world. Then followed some other designation that divided the location, and then a number, apparently up to 9999. One of the oldest geocities locations is CapeCanaveral and Lenny Flank has been there, debunking creationism, for a decade or more. I think that he is a herpetologist, at least as an amateur.\n \n There is no connection to any U.S. Government installation. You can tell that because nowhere do you see .gov",
