   "I don't want to discuss UK healthcare in the thread about CUNxTime's illness, but I feel I should challenge the absurd assertions made in that thread.\n \n \nThe sad fact is Jo, that if what happened to Sep happened in GB, he would have died before he made it through the waiting list to actually get actively and positively treated. And if you want to be honest with yourself, you would admit that. \n \n\n \n This is totally untrue. With CUNxTime's symptoms, this is broadly what would have happened:\n \n 1. call NHS Direct (24 hour telephone helpline), describe symptoms over the phone, they will have a doctor call back within the hour, or send an ambulance if the symptoms are serious. In most cases the advice from the doctor is likely to be make an appointment with the GP, but in CUNxTime's case they would almost certainly have told him to present at an Accident and Emergency Department (one in almost every major hospital)\n 2. Present at A&E, triage is done almost immediately, to see whether the situation warrants being put ahead of sprained ankles and minor cuts, if so then treatment will be almost immediate. DVT is a major concern for the NHS and they're well aware of the symptoms and consequences.\n 3. Admission for treatment. In the past there might have been a wait for a bed, this doesn't happen often (if at all) now.\n \n As for the more general comments:\n \nHealth Care Around the World: Great Britain\n April 23, 2008 in Health Care Around the World, International Health Care Systems\n Great Britain represents all that is good and bad with centralized, single-payer health care systems. Health care spending is fairly low (7.5% of GDP) and very equitable. Long wait lists for treatment, however are endemic and rationing pervades the system. Patients have little choice of provider and little access to specialists. \n\n \n Any time a GP does not feel confident in a diagnosis, or they are not trained to provide the necessary treatment, they will make a referral to a specialist. What is wrong with that? Do I need to be able to see a pediatrist every time I have a bunion?\n \n \n\n Percent Insured. ~100%\n \n Funding. Great Britain has a single payer system funded by general revenues. With any centralized system, avoiding deficits is difficult. In 2006, Great Britain had a \u00a3700 million deficit despite the fact that health care spending increased by \u00a343 billion over five years.\n \n\n \n Absurd claim. Centralised systems can avoid deficits, indeed the NHS has run a surplus (in itself not a good thing) for the last 2 years (which is presumably why the article cherry-picked the last time there was a deficit).\n \n \n\n Private Insurance. 10% of Britons have private health insurance. Private health insurance replicates the coverage provided by the NHS, but gives patients access to higher quality care, and reduced waiting times.\n \n\n \n The quality of the care is not better, indeed in a lot of cases it will be provided by NHS doctors in NHS hospitals. This is extremely lucrative for consultants. Yes, private hospitals have private rooms and better food. They are also hopelessly inefficient, and virtually no-one who has private care relies on it exclusively. Additionally, most of those 10% get it as part of their job, very few make the choice to purchase it independently. It's also worth noting that because of the NHS, private insurance premiums are substantially lower than in the UK. I'll concede the waiting times, but only for non-urgent cases.\n \n \n\n Physician Compensation. Unlike in the case of other single payer systems such as Norway, most physicians and nurses are mostly government employees. In 2004, the NHS negotiated lower salaries for doctors in exchange for reduced work hours. Few physicians are available at night or on weekends. Because of low compensation, there is a significant shortage of specialists.\n \n\n \n GP average salaries top GBP100k, that's around USD150-200k, consultant salaries are even higher. That information is 5 years out of date. There have since been new arrangements which have expanded out of hours care. As I've already mentioned I can call a GP, but there is usually an out of hours service at my local health centre, and failing that at my local hospital.\n \n \n\n Physician Choice. Patients have very little physician choice. However, under the experimental London Patient Choice Project, patients waiting more than six months for treatment will be offered a choice of four different treatment providers.\n \n\n \n I can see whichever GP I like. It doesn't even have to be at the practice where I'm registered, I can make an emergency appointment at any practice in the country, and have done on the Isle of Skye or at the Oxford Eye Hospital in the past. I can register with my local practice and choose any GP there. I can request to see a GP of my own gender if I prefer, or request a second opinion. I also get a rather pointless choice of hospital if I want an operation (duh, the nearest one so my wife can visit).\n \n \n\n Copayment/Deductibles. There are no deductibles and almost no copayments except for small copayments for prescription drugs, as well as for optical and dental care.\n \n\n \n This is the biggest problem actually, dental and optical care, and this is the area most like the US system. It's probably 5 years since I've been to a dentist because the costs of treatment aren't covered by the NHS (once you're over 18 and not poor) and unless I have a problem I don't want to shell out the money. Prescriptions aren't so bad because, while it is GBP7 per prescription, you never pay more than GBP90 in a year, and nothing at all in Scotland or Wales.\n \n \n\n Waiting Times. Waiting lists are a huge problem in Great Britain. Some examples: 750,000 are on waiting lists for hospital admission; 40% of cancer patients are never able to see an oncologist; there is explicit rationing for services such as kidney dialysis, open heart surgery and care for the terminally ill. Further, minimum waiting times have been instituted to reduce costs. \"A top-flight hospital like Suffolk Est PCT was ordered to impose a minimum waiting time of at least 122 days before patients could be treated or the hospital would lose a portion of its funding.\"\n \n\n \n Suffolk Est PCT isn't a hospital, for starters. It's a primary care trust which means it runs all patient services in that area. I call BS on that quote, by the way. I'm not aware of explicit rationing except for IVF and certain cancer drugs which provide some extention to life at massive cost. It's worth noting that most people terminally ill in the US would not get those cancer drugs either, having either exceeded their lifetime spend, lost their job and hence their insurance, or been refused by their insurance company. Being on a waiting list just means you haven't been seen yet. The NHS see millions of patients, a 2 week wait to see an oncologist about a sore eye puts you on a waiting list, it's a smaller problem than is being made out, and a much smaller one than it was 10 years ago.\n \n \n\n Benefits Covered. The NHS system offers comprehensive coverage. Because of rationing, care might not be as easy to get as advertised. Terminally ill patients may be denied treatment. David Cameron has proposed that the NHS refuse treatment to smokers or the obese \n \n\n \n Again, rubbish. Neither I nor anyone I know has had trouble getting treated by the NHS. My Dad receives monthly doses of the blood derivative for a neurological disorder at a cost of thousands of pounds a year, and there has never been any mention of the cost. Terminally ill patients may be refused treatment if it is ineffective or the costs are totally disproportionate, but such cases are extremely rare. The bigger problem the NHS has is intervening to readily in end of life, rather than allowing people to go peacefully at home.\n \n The final, and vital, thing to mention is that while to NHS is imperfect and short of cash in places, we spend less than half what the US does on healthcare and yet cover everyone for (almost) everything.",

This is particularly absurd. I lived in Canada under Ontario Health Insurance Plan - OHIP. I could choose any physician I wanted because 90% of them accepted OHIP. I chose the one right accross the street. I did not have to drive half accross the town like in the U.S. to find the physician in the particular PPO, HMO etc. (I still d not know what all these acronyms mean.)\n \n I had a few emergencies in Canada. If anything the waiting time was shorter than in the U.S. emergency rooms. Once I had heart attack like symptoms. The waiting time was zero. Once I had an emergency in Quebcec - no problem with Ontario card. In either case I paid nothing.\n \n BTW, unless I am mistaken even Margaret Thatcher was for a single payer.

   "Margaret Thatcher has quite a few similarities with Nazis (starting wars, persecuting trade unionists) but that's beside the point.\n \n I've tracked down the figure for 40% of British cancer patients never see an oncologist. It comes from a 1994 paper (i.e. 15 years out of date) at a time when Britain was in the worst recession for quite a while and the (tory) government had slashed public spending. The changes have been massive since then, it's hardly the same system any more (and judging from the range of cites in other sources, the report Review of the Pattern of Cancer Services in England and Wales was a major spur to reform). It's also worth noting that the article cited a Cato Policy Analysis which cited another Cato Policy Analysis before actually giving the source for the stat. It's almost as if they either didn't want people to know or didn't check that the source was 15 years out of date. Finally it should be recognised that the public nature of the NHS means that such things are a matter of public discourse when they are discovered and steps are taken to see them fixed.",

I haven't seen any studies on this and whether or not that would save money.\n \n So I dunno where the savings would be. I'm honestly asking. Maybe the US is just unhealthy haha.\n\n \n Firstly Steeve, I'd like to say thanks for giving some serious thoughts to the comparison. I don't have hard data for everything, but I have a few ideas about differences in the systems that make account for the discrepancy:\n \n 1. Healthcare is free at the point of need. It doesn't cost any more to see a doctor 10 times than 1 time. This means conditions get spotted early and treated more cheaply. In some cases GPs in the UK can and do prescribe diet and exercise classes, which is a good deal cheaper, even for a thousand patients, than heart surgery and related drugs. If someone gets a deep cut they'll go and get it seen to rather than wait, hope it heals up and save the copay. Preventative and early treatment I think contribute a lot.\n \n 2. Bulk buying. The NHS can bargain hard with drug companies, it has the muscle to get concessions from GlaxoSmithKline that smaller, private firms can only dream of. This isn't the same as the fixed prices found in Canada (as I understand it).\n \n 3. Other economies of scale, and access to government credit. A hospital can be built with government money, rather than commercial loans (I say can, one of the big extra costs recently has been PFI, but I'll leave that be for now, it's a bit complex and rather peripheral).\n \n 4. Nobody is creaming off profits. Nobody is trying to make money from the NHS. Some contracts are given to private firms (the results are decidedly mixed) but the vast bulk of the NHS is public service, with no money disappearin into the pockets of shareholders.\n \n 5. No insurance system overheads. There is no complex bureaucratic system deciding whether you can get treatment paid for, no claims adjusters. There's just you and your doctor. If your doctor thinks you need a treatment and that treatment is covered by the NHS, you get it, no questions asked. And almost everything is covered by the NHS, right up to gender reassignment, reconstructive cosmetic surgery, IVF (up to a point). The list of things not covered is tiny.\n \n 6. No costs for the uninsured presenting at ER (A&E in the UK).\n \n 7. Doctors have some authority. I don't think they can outright refuse to let you see specialist, but the vast majority of people will only see a specialist on the recommendation of their GP. Likewise they will only undergo the tests the GP deems appropriate. More crucially, GPs don't tend to recommend a full battery of tests for minor problems, as I understand can be the case in the US. You get an MRI scan if the doctor thinks you may have something that would be picked up by an MRI machine, not just on the off-chance.\n \n I can certainly confirm that in most areas the NHS is better than it was under the previous government. If anything I think that is the biggest downside - the NHS is subject to the ideology of the government of the day. I dread to think what the NHS would be like if either party in the US got hold of it.

   "I have not read enough about the UK HealthCare system to conclude whether it is better, the same, or worse than the current US system. I suspect you will find people that think it stinks based upon their own bad experiences and people who think it is great based upon their own good experiences...just like the US. \n \n From what I can tell the US spends their health care dollar this way:\n http://www.ordinary-gentlemen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/health_costs.jpg\n http://econjournal.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/clip-image003.jpg\n \n Where do the savings come in with a national health care system? Lets assume you can kill some administrative costs..that drops your % of GDP spending by, at best, 1-1.5% of GDP. So now you are at 15% compared to the 9.1% the UK has. I've also discovered that the UK system was worse a decade ago and has improved (please confirm this) and as such spending as a percentage of GDP has gone up as well from 7% to 9%. I also want to note that I'm not a huge fan of comparing % of GDP numbers across countries because it sometimes gives you an incorrect picture. \n \n So is the money going to come by cutting the money given to the doctors? From what I understand the US doesn't pay much more than the UK. I think nurses are paid more in the US but cutting their salary seems like a bad idea since we have a nursing shortage. Seems a universal system would have to cut costs someway based on the graph above.\n \n Cutting costs based by allowing outside medicine, tort reform (which would hopefully help excessive testing), and better insurance competition might work. All of these could be achieved regardless of what system you use. \n \n Would having care for all reduce hospital trips? I haven't seen any studies on this and whether or not that would save money.\n \n So I dunno where the savings would be. I'm honestly asking. Maybe the US is just unhealthy haha.\n\n \n Where does 1-1.5% of GDP in administrative costs come from? Maybe it is more. The insurance companies spend money on advertising. They also spend your money on PR, lobbying and buying political influence, which I find illegitimate.

   "Firstly Steeve, I'd like to say thanks for giving some serious thoughts to the comparison. I don't have hard data for everything, but I have a few ideas about differences in the systems that make account for the discrepancy:\nThank you for taking the time to come up with some ideas! People like to take two sentences from a biased new article to determine another nations national health care system. I frankly have no idea about Canada or GB and probably can't without doing insane research or live there for awhile. Either way, I'll post some comments on the below.\n \n \n1. Healthcare is free at the point of need. It doesn't cost any more to see a doctor 10 times than 1 time. This means conditions get spotted early and treated more cheaply. In some cases GPs in the UK can and do prescribe diet and exercise classes, which is a good deal cheaper, even for a thousand patients, than heart surgery and related drugs. If someone gets a deep cut they'll go and get it seen to rather than wait, hope it heals up and save the copay. Preventative and early treatment I think contribute a lot.\nI actually wish that if the US kept private health insurers that we would have some system that rewarded healthy habits such as exercise. They do it for car insurance why not health? Company wide health plans kind of prevent this. At the same time I've never noticed people not going to the doctor in the US because of a $15 copay. I also don't know what the follow-up stats are for the US or UK. If there is a difference than that would certainly make a difference. \n \n \n2. Bulk buying. The NHS can bargain hard with drug companies, it has the muscle to get concessions from GlaxoSmithKline that smaller, private firms can only dream of. This isn't the same as the fixed prices found in Canada (as I understand it).\nNo doubt the US has a drug problem. I've seen the stats on this and apparently the US system pays more for drugs. I've read three or four studies that say the UK (and Canada) actually have controls over prices either directly (price setting) or indirectly (normally like a tax). Is this true? I also wonder if this could be mitigated some other way...as in, is it really that a NHS is the only way to control the costs? I dunno but the Medicare part D only raised the prices of drugs. \n \n \n3. Other economies of scale, and access to government credit. A hospital can be built with government money, rather than commercial loans (I say can, one of the big extra costs recently has been PFI, but I'll leave that be for now, it's a bit complex and rather peripheral).\nI dunno if this is plausible...perhaps if I saw some data. We have state \"owned\" hospitals in the US that are basically privately run and the cost is about the same from what I've seen (I've audited hospitals before). \n \n \n4. Nobody is creaming off profits. Nobody is trying to make money from the NHS. Some contracts are given to private firms (the results are decidedly mixed) but the vast bulk of the NHS is public service, with no money disappearin into the pockets of shareholders.\nDo hospitals or doctor's offices make profits or are they all not-for-profit organizations? I honestly don't know. Obviously in the US they end up with a profit. If they make profits in the UK than I doubt this would make a difference. The benefit would be in insurance but that is only 7% of total US health expenditures of which only 4.5% (I think) is the average profit margin for them. I assumed no insurance costs (-7%) in my estimate that brought down % of GDP by 1-2%.\n \n \n \n5. No insurance system overheads. There is no complex bureaucratic system deciding whether you can get treatment paid for, no claims adjusters. There's just you and your doctor. If your doctor thinks you need a treatment and that treatment is covered by the NHS, you get it, no questions asked. And almost everything is covered by the NHS, right up to gender reassignment, reconstructive cosmetic surgery, IVF (up to a point). The list of things not covered is tiny.\nSee above...this is not as high as I thought it was. It certainly would be a savings but would it be offset by something else? I don't know.\n \n You know, plastic surgery..elective...is actually pretty darn cheap in the US.\n \n \n6. No costs for the uninsured presenting at ER (A&E in the UK).\nThis might be a good point and I'd love to see some data on this. Does the US have more ER visits than the UK? Do the insured cost us a ton by going to the ER and then don't pay which means the hospital charges more for goods which ends up being paid by insured folks? I'll look for some data on this in the US if you can get some UK data...maybe data on visits to ER per capita or something.\n \n \n7. Doctors have some authority. I don't think they can outright refuse to let you see specialist, but the vast majority of people will only see a specialist on the recommendation of their GP. Likewise they will only undergo the tests the GP deems appropriate. More crucially, GPs don't tend to recommend a full battery of tests for minor problems, as I understand can be the case in the US. You get an MRI scan if the doctor thinks you may have something that would be picked up by an MRI machine, not just on the off-chance.\nYeah, over testing is a problem from everything I've read and experienced. I went to the doctor for a problem that I knew and yet I still had a million tests. Now the question is why this is. Does the doctor not want to get sued? Does the doctor get more money and doesn't get more money in the UK for more tests (I'm not sure)? Does the lack of direct pay by a person effect this at all? Maybe a combination of any of them. This one might be valid.\n \n \nQuestion: What's the world's third largest employer?\n Answer: the NHS (the first two are the Chinese Army and Indian Railways).\nWow that is crazy!\n \n So drug costs, ER for uninsured, and over testing are all plausible reasons for higher US health care to me. I'm not sure you have to have a national health care system to fix that...or even if it does fix that but I certainly don't think the senate plan announced today addresses any of these.",

   "Jo, thankyou firstly for creating a thread where it's possible to calmly debate a point of contention. It's actually the first time I've seen a pro-national healthcare thread (or indeed news article) that wasn't built around claims denigrating some group of people as racists or hicks.\n \n I firmly believe the healthcare systems in place in the UK, Canada and Australia, and to some extent mainland Europe, rival or beat the US's in most areas.\n \n The US has better specialists, better technology and basically a better standard of care in some areas (Cancer, a lot of elective medicine - basically ailments that hit the rich as much as the poor), and it conducts a great deal of the world's medical research, but in terms of price/value for normal treatments, the commonwealth's systems are, on the whole, far better.\n \n Hell I have private insurance in Australia. It costs me $450 per year (which is about $400 US - more like $300 US before the fed decided to devalue the US Dollar as fast as possible), and covers virtually all emergency or hospital related costs. I get some reimbursement for dental work and other more routine things, which seems kind of stupid to me, but whatever. Forgetting anything else, US private healthcare costs seem obscenely high.\n \n As you've agreed though Jo, the \"reform\" proposed, wouldn't equalise things. I don't even think it would make them better, at all. It wouldn't go halfway there, it's going in the exact opposite direction.\n \n Part of the problem is the \"reform\" panders to the corporate interests of big-pharma... but even if the US copied the healthcare policies of the UK, it wouldn't get the healthcare outcomes or costs of the UK.\n \n Even if it took them, and adapted it to its own situation, it wouldn't get the healthcare outcomes or costs of the UK. It's sort of like saying if it adopted the gun control laws of the UK, its crime rate would drop to that of the UK. Which I think we both know, it wouldn't.\n \n The US is so large and so diverse, economically, culturally, politically, ethnically, philosophically and religiously - a national US healthcare system is inevitably less like a UK healthcare system, and more like an EU healthcare system. Large. Bureaucratic. Divisive. Unable to handle the needs of a diverse population with fundamentally different beliefs and values and needs.\n \n At a state level, it could do it. And it could do it very well. But at a national level, there is absolutely no way in hell any proposal of this nature will ever work effectively in the US.\n \n But again, this is all very theoretical, because the bulk of the US' reasons for high healthcare costs, which I have outlined in detail in the past, are in no way addressed by any of the many proposals before congress.",

I'd be interested in how a 50 state model would work...TennCare was like this but still had the federal component which caused issues.\n \n I think some of the problems we discussed are accurate. CEO salaries and profit margins at hospitals are actually not that high (1-3% normally) and don't make up a huge cost in the US so I'm not convinced this is a big issue. Doctors are also not paid more apparently. I do wonder if the US hospitals buy more equipment. When I audited hospitals they always had $500,000 pieces of equipment collecting dust because a doctor just wanted it one day but never used it. \n \n The real question is what to do about it and we know Congress has nothing good right now...and that includes the republicans as well.",

   "Steeve:\n \n \n Yeah, over testing is a problem from everything I've read and experienced. I went to the doctor for a problem that I knew and yet I still had a million tests. Now the question is why this is. Does the doctor not want to get sued? Does the doctor get more money and doesn't get more money in the UK for more tests (I'm not sure)? Does the lack of direct pay by a person effect this at all? Maybe a combination of any of them. This one might be valid.\n\n \n I think a large factor could be the culture of lawsuits in the US. Especially in fields such as OB/GYN, malpractice is a huge concern, leading many doctors to practice \"defensive medicine\". They will order excessive tests so if they get sued they can show that they were thorough and covered all the bases.\n \n Also I agree with JoBennett that \"free\" doctor visits increase the quality/quantity of primary care in the population. Cost would not be a reason for anyone to delay getting routine care such as check-ups, paps, minor problems, or monitoring chronic issues like hypertension. I believe this leads to better health in the population and saves the health care system as a whole money when problems are identified early and dealt with before they become catastrophic.\n \n edit: I understand Obama has proposed some sort of malpractice reform.

   "The NHS cannot guarantee the level of care that is equal to someone with the ready cash to buy it.\n\n \n I disagree with this, at least in part. What you pay for is generally convenience, privacy, and a bit of luxury, not quality of care. Often it will be exactly the same doctors as an NHS hospital that treat you. You pay for a private room, being able to book when you want (because private hospitals only have a 50% bed occupancy rate compared to 90%+ in the NHS) and having nicer food and furnishings. Now, it would be possible to provide this on the NHS, if people were prepared to pay the increase in cost. I and most others don't think it's worth it. Maybe some improvements in food delivery would be a good idea (this is largely a function of the use of older buildings as I understand it).\n \n Of course having the personal attention of a doctor for as long as you deem necessary can result in better care, but I think the improvements are likely to be marginal.",

   "Consider this:\n \n\n Second, history shows that those who say tax rate reductions cut donations are wrong, Butler says. In 1984, the first year that President Reagan's historic tax cuts took full effect, charitable giving was almost 12 percent higher than it had been in 1980. \n \n Eyeing Reagan's next round of tax reform in 1986, philanthropy experts again predicted donations would decrease, by $8 billion per year. Charitable giving did decrease slightly in the first year after the package took effect. But it had increased sharply the year before and did so again the year after--most likely, Butler says, because donors were adjusting their giving schedules to take advantage of changing tax policy. Between 1984 and 1989, total giving rose faster--not slower--than during similar periods. \n \n Third, most donors give little consideration to tax policy in deciding whether or how much to give. \"People donated to charity primarily for religious, civic or philosophical reasons,\" Butler says. \"Corporations, for instance, donate for many reasons--general goodwill among the corporate executives, improved public image and because contributions in time and money have been shown to increase employee morale. What tax policy does is influence the timing and method of contribution, not the amount.\" \n \n Personal income is a more reliable factor in measuring how often and how much individuals will give. \"Studies show that as households become less worried about their economic condition, their propensity to give increases dramatically,\" he says. \"Donations tend to track economic conditions, which explains why donations usually increase in size and frequency in the wake of a major tax cut.\" \n Heritage Foundation Study Shows Tax-Cut Plan Will Likely Boost Charitable Giving. | Legal < Tax Law from AllBusiness.com \n\n \n Once a person is no longer worrying about meeting their own needs, charitable contributions increase. The converse is also true. Saddle the taxpayer with more taxes and the first thing that suffers are charities.\n \n \n\n What happens to giving during recessions?\n \n A recent examination of charitable giving during recession years in America shows that a slowing economy definitely affects donations to non-profit organizations. \n \n A 2001 Giving USA report on charitable donations found that after an economic downturn, charitable giving typically does not keep up with increases in inflation. Upon revisiting the subject in 2008, it was found that giving slows slightly during recessions. In the five recessions since the one between 1973-1975, giving fell an average of 1.3 percent adjusted for inflation. In non-recession years from 1966 through 2006, giving has increased an inflation-adjusted average of 4.3 percent. (Both of these calculations adjust for inflation using the consumer price index and match figures reported in Giving USA 2007.)\n \n In two economic slumps, in 1973 and again in 2001, donations failed to keep pace with the growth in inflation for three years straight. Giving also declined after the 1987 stock market collapse. Scholars now attribute most of the 1987 decline to pre-payment of gifts in 1986, when donors gave early to take advantage of deductions that were restricted when new tax laws took effect in 1987.\n What Happens to Giving During a Recession?

So you cannot tell me how the government is \"rationing\" healthcare and everybody is waiting for eveything. I had more choice of physicians in Canada. The waiting time in emergency rooms is shorter in Canada than in the U.S. I never had to wait for anything.\n \n BTW, how long do the uninsured wait for MRI?[/QUOTE]\n \n \n \n Maybe all of those Canadian plates were people that didn't want to wait months for an MRI? It appears that Canada is woefully behind the US and 12th amongst the OECD. ;)\n \n Oh, and if the uninsured need an MRI to save their life, I'd guess they get one within hours.[/QUOTE]\n \n Hmm ... Interesting. I think that explains it. If in the U.S. they perform the same test four times instead of once they need four times as as many scanners. I think they cost about a million. This explains the high cost.\n \n As far as the uninsured getting MRI within an hour: who pays for that?",

Here's the basics for their House Plan, for example:\n \n\n House GOP Solutions Group Outlines Health Care Plan to Increase Affordability, Accessibility, Availability\n Commonsense Health Care Reform to Lower Costs and Increase Access and Quality at a Price Our Country Can Afford\n Republicans believe there are a number of potential areas for common ground to work with President Obama to improve health care for all Americans. Republicans are promoting commonsense reforms that make health care more affordable, reduce the number of uninsured Americans, and increase quality at a price our country can afford---while making sure that Americans who like their health care coverage can keep it.\n The House Republican Health Care Solutions Group has been working for months on a plan, listening to the American people, talking to doctors and patients, collecting input, and studying and debating ideas. This process has resulted in the broad outline of a health care reform plan that the solutions group hopes will receive bipartisan support.\n The health care reforms outlined are designed to:\n 1. Make quality health care coverage affordable and accessible for every American, regardless of pre-existing health conditions.\n 2. Protect Americans from being forced into a new government-run health care plan that would: a) eliminate the health care coverage that more than 100 million Americans currently receive through their job; b) limit your choice of doctors and medical treatment options; and c) result in the federal government taking control of your health care.\n 3. Let Americans who like their health care coverage keep it, and give all Americans the freedom to choose the health plan that best meets their needs.\n 4. Ensure that medical decisions are made by patients and their doctors, not government bureaucrats.\n 5. Improve Americans' lives through effective prevention, wellness, and disease management programs, while developing new treatments and cures for life-threatening diseases.\n http://www.gopleader.gov/UploadedFiles/06-17-09_House__GOP_Solutions__Group__Outline.pdf \n\n \n Just because you bought the left's rhetoric about Republicans not having an idea, doesn't make it a fact.

I find the dichotomy more than a little hypocritical.\n If it takes a village to raise a kid, then the kid should have to abide by that village's morality. That's the price he pays for the village's assistance.\n\n \n There is a vast difference between personal morality and how someone behaves to others.

   "So you want to keep the status quo?\n\n \n Preferably not but you have to look at priorities too. I think our education and financial aid system sucks but you don't see me screaming for a change right now. \n \n Likewise, I don't think healthcare is more important thank fixing our economy right now. \n \n Now with that said, it is too late since the president made it an issue. So if I am forced to take a position other than \"lets wait until we can afford to do something\" than I'd say we should change it to something that would actually work in the US that would 1)actually reduce costs 2)not add to the deficit 3)allows more people to obtain healthcare coverage (which would be helped by reduced costs) 4)Not worsen the care we currently enjoy\n \n Sound familiar? It should since Obama basically says these things. Sadly this is not what Obama's plan really does and frankly I haven't seen a proposal that would do this. The biggest fault is trying to reduce costs..meaning getting our costs to a normal amount of GDP...or rather reasonable compared to other countries (since GDP can be misleading). Slandering the health insurance companies is not going to achieve this goal. Frankly, they aren't a direct reason for the higher costs...although they may be an INDIRECT reason. I can explore that more if you want. So getting costs down is a challenge. Obama's plan increases the deficit as the CBO stated. The newer proposal (not Obama's) might but I'm not convinced yet. Most of the plans seem to allow more people to be on it but that drives up costs if you aren't lower costs per person. Finally, Obama's main plan would worsen our level of care...by this I don't mean the doctors would get worse but that we would have the problems you see in Canada and the UK.

They failed. Even at its worst people would rather have the NHS than privatise it.\n\n \n I've heard how the UK reduces its costs:\n \n\n Tuesday, July 07, 2009\n Top 10 Ways UK Rations Healthcare to Save Money \n WALL STREET JOURNAL -- Speaking to the American Medical Association last month, President Obama waxed enthusiastic about countries that \"spend less\" than the U.S. on health care. He's right that many countries do, but what he doesn't want to explain is how they ration care to do it.\n \n Take the United Kingdom, which is often praised for spending as little as half as much per capita on health care as the U.S. Credit for this cost containment goes in large part to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Americans should understand how NICE works because under ObamaCare it will eventually be coming to a hospital near you. NICE has established the principle that the only way to control health-care costs is for this panel of medical high priests to dictate limits on certain kinds of care to certain classes of patients. \n \n For example:\n \n 1. In March, NICE ruled against the use of two drugs, Lapatinib and Sutent, that prolong the life of those with certain forms of breast and stomach cancer.\n \n 2. This followed on a 2008 ruling against drugs -- including Sutent, which costs about $50,000 -- that would help terminally ill kidney-cancer patients.\n \n 3. In 2007, NICE restricted access to two drugs for macular degeneration, a cause of blindness. The drug Macugen was blocked outright. The other, Lucentis, was limited to a particular category of individuals with the disease, restricting it to about one in five sufferers. Even then, the drug was only approved for use in one eye, meaning those lucky enough to get it would still go blind in the other.\n \n 4. NICE has limited the use of Alzheimer's drugs, including Aricept, for patients in the early stages of the disease.\n \n 5. NICE rejected the use of Kineret, a drug for rheumatoid arthritis.\n \n 6. NICE rejected Avonex, which reduces the relapse rate in patients with multiple sclerosis;\n \n 7. NICE rejected Lenalidomide, which fights multiple myeloma.\n \n NOTE: Private U.S. insurers often cover all, or at least portions, of the cost of many of these NICE-denied drugs.\n \n NICE has also produced guidance that restrains certain surgical operations and treatments.\n \n 8. NICE has restrictions on fertility treatments.\n \n 9. NICE has restriction on procedures for back pain, including surgeries and steroid injections.\n \n 10. Several young U.K. women developed cervical cancer after being denied pap smears by a related health authority, the Cervical Screening Programme, which in order to reduce government health-care spending has refused the screens to women under age 25.\n \n Bottom Line: Rationing = Lower cost = lower quality healthcare\n \n HT: Bob Wright\n CARPE DIEM: Top 10 Ways UK Rations Healthcare to Save Money \n",

For most of his adult life, their leader has benefited from just the kind of government, tax-supported healthcare he's fighting to keep them from having, too. \n \n When Dick Armey taught economics at the University of North Texas for 13 years his health insurance was administered by the state and supplemented by the taxpayers. \n \n When he was elected to Congress, he was covered by the federal employees' health benefit plan. And when he retired from Congress eighteen years later, he was insured by that plan until he turned 66 and Medicare, another government program, kicked in. All the time he's been making some half a million dollars a year working for FreedomWorks and raking in lobbyist fees amounting to what he recently called \"a darned handsome pile of dough.\" \n \n You can't blame him for keeping his government health plan. It's great. It gave him a lot of options, dozens of private insurers to choose from, and with eight million members in it, the federal government's got the muscle to negotiate some of the best premiums and drug prices in the country. That's not all. Taxpayers subsidize these federal health insurance plans by as much as 75% of the premium cost. Beneficiaries -- including members and retired members of congress like armey -- pay their share of the premiums with pre-tax dollars. \n \n Not bad. \n \n Now get this: Dick Armey thought so much of that federal health plan - the cadillac of coverage --that he tried to keep it as his primary carrier, instead of that other federal program, medicare. \n \n Mr. Armey wanted an option. A government option. How about that? \n \n But he couldn't get out of medicare without losing his Social Security (they're hitched together -- you give up one, you give up both), so he's suing to divorce the two ... And now he says he's happy to buy his health insurance on his own - and why not? He's got that pile of dough. And there's the rub. \n \n Dick Armey is the epitome of those people with power and privilege who are insured against the vicissitudes of life, and want no government assistance for any suffering ... Except their own. \n \n And all those members of congress sitting there during the president's speech last week? Joe Wilson, included. They; too have Cadillac federal coverage subsidized by tax dollars. \n \n That's no lie. \n \n ------------------------\n \n Someone's FOS, but it ain't Obama. ;)",

   "I called taxation legalized theft, there's a distinction that I'm making.\n In the US, the plan is to fund healthcare for the poor on the backs of the \"rich\". Obama has stated many times that anyone making <$250k would not see a dime in new taxes. All that means is that his socialist program is targetted at the wealthy ONLY. Did they get a say in all of this, NO. The fact is that as a % of the population vs the amount of taxes paid, the wealthy are robbed daily. 10 poor people can vote to take 50% of the wealthy 11th person's income is legal but extremely immoral, IMO. So, essentially, we have a confiscatory system in which those with no stake in the law's financial impact get to vote on what is done with somebody else's money. That's criminal, IMO. emoticon_angry\n\n \n No, it's simply a system to correct the imbalances produced by capitalism. The wealthy have benefitted greatly from the structure of the economic and political system to become wealthy so it's only fair that they make a greater contribution to that system.",

   "Moving your home is a valid strategy to limit or prevent the government stealing from you, but it is a drastic one. Personally I like it, and so do the many people each year who move to low or no tax countries, who I should soon be one of, but it's important to recognise that the elderly or those with other commitments may not be able to pack up their bags and leave.\n \n Of course, the higher the level of government crime in an area, the more incentive to leave, as you see in countries such as North Korea, Zimbabwe and Cuba, and in situations such as this even the very elderly may become refugees, but this isn't something we should hope for, or propose as a realistic solution in places where the level of government stealing from the community is more moderate.\n \n And let's not pretend it's ok for a criminal to commit crimes in an area, simply because the people living in that area have the opportunity to flee.
