Without the wages, total costs, assuming your numbers are correct, are a a mere 33 or so billion more then Iraq. The problem is that those costs to provide for illegals are usually state borne in cost, and most states are not borrowing billions daily to support them where the Federal Government is selling T-bills in huge numbers. $133 billion in tax and spend form is $133 billion. $100 billion in borrowed is not $100 billion, usually far, far, far more. Anyone who's done the numbers for the Vietnam total costs knows that what we spent in paper is not what cost us in reality.\n \n I went through your 'links.' A number of them don't exist.

Ending a majority of foreign intervention is really not a bad thing (other than when required..ie genocide or something).

Finally, he needs to back off the no taxes thing. In fact, they all do. We are up to our tree tops in debt and frankly are going to have to raise taxes and cut benefits...the very opposite of what people want. The sad thing is, most Americans don't seem to see past tomorrow or remember yesterday and are selfish. So what do we elect? Someone who will cut taxes and raise benefits. \n \n If I were to run for president I would run on cutting taxes and raising benefits and then immediately shut down the government until they raised taxes (at least for some) and balanced the budget.

If they are to be managed, someone has to pay for it. \n\n \n Most of those items are usages / transactions that take place between two private parties. The government does not manage them!

What does the government do to help one inherit something, or take inventory?\n \n \nThat seems VERY straightforward to me.\n\n \n That's probably because you see the government working hard, to keep waterways and lakes sparkling clean (fishing licences) or dog catchers hard at work (dog licences) or cancer being cured (cigarette taxes) etc etc. Some people in the private sector, who have to compete with others in the private sector, don't see the government competing with anyone, and don't see the government working all that hard. \n \n When a large percentage of workers in a competitive society aren't competing with anyone, it can cause economic problems IMO.\n \n \nOn top of that, would you rather be without some of these public services? \n \n \n Most of them, yes.

   "It was just liberal economic opinion - a lot of vague speculation. Example;\n\n \n Are you saying that expatriations don't create jobs?\n \n As usual, you are wrong\n \n \nFormerly, associations of U.S.-based Mexicans from the north central Zacatecas state focused on fund-raising for building sidewalks, sewers, electrical lines and paved roads in their hometowns.\n \n Now, they are emphasizing creating jobs in Zacatecas in order to prevent youth from migrating to the United States in search of jobs, reports La Opini\u00f3n, a Spanish-language daily published in Los Angeles.\n\n \n http://news.pacificnews.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=8872d807dd85e5cb0a4fff02bf956770\n \n \nThat can't be proven. You yourself said that without some big special study, both sides are posturing.\n\n \n Stop being Dishonest\n \n What I said is that without a conclusive studying showing that illegals are either a net negative or a net positive factor, both sides are posturing.\n \n What I'm doing is showing your arguments are, as always, full of ####. \n \n \nThat is their right, under the Constitution.\n\n \n No it's not. The Constitution does not grant them the right to declare that numbers, accounting and financial data isn't true because they want it to be false. \n \n \nTry to use the word \"than\", rather than \"then\", the way it can sound in a rapid verbal conversation. Making very unusual gramatical errors makes it easy to see that you have multiple user names. From\n\n \n Wow, all you have is grammar attacks?\n \n Not surprising. And again you ignored my post. Pathetic. It's hard to determine the forum's worst poster, you or Angel.\n \n \nI don't believe that any aspects of illegal immigration are good in the long run. Your liberal talking points didn't change my mind.\n\n \n Correct, facts, reason and logic don't change your mind. That's obvious from your posting history. You've been crushed by the majority of users here on many occasions, including one on one judged debates. Just last week you claimed that evolution was atheistic despite your astronomical failure to prove just that in an formal debate. You are essentially arguing with yourself as you refuse to even acknowledge the points of your opponent. \n \n Explain to me how making American firms more competitive in a globalized economy is a bad thing.\n \n Explain to me how providing workers with jobs who fund job creation in Mexico which reduces illegal immigration is an bad thing.\n \n And we already proved you have no idea what liberal nor conservative actually mean. I'm simply going to replace liberal with Pony and conservative with Rabbit every time you use them as your usage clearly has the same level of understanding and meaning.\n \n \nDomestic spending is more related to your opening link than the Iraq war. From your link;\n\n \n Except that the major expenditures of the nation are more on Iraq then illegal immigration welfare. I already explained how the spending is far less then the federal expenditures on Iraq. You in your cowardice ways chose to ignore \n this as you do with everything that requires utilization of gray matter.\n \n Here is again and I'll bet you are going to pretend this doesn't exist:\n \n 4) Iraq costs around $100 billion an year. Without the wages, total costs, assuming your numbers are correct, are a a mere 33 or so billion more then Iraq. The problem is that those costs to provide for illegals are usually state borne in cost, and most states are not borrowing billions daily to support them where the Federal Government is selling T-bills in huge numbers. $133 billion in tax and spend form is $133 billion. $100 billion in borrowed is not $100 billion, usually far, far, far more. Anyone who's done the numbers for the Vietnam total costs knows that what we spent in paper is not what cost us in reality.\n \n \nEntitlement programs! Our middle east involvement is not an entitlement program! Georged brought it up, and you said this to me, several posts later;\n\n \n In some ways it is. The whole cost plus accounting for defense has created essentially an entitlement program for the defense industry. If they can present even a half baked idea, they get funded in fashion that is very anti-cost reduction. \n \n \nThe subject, was \"key omissions\", as they relate to opinions about how the US should / should not spend money. Again, from your link;\n\n \n How is that quote even relevant? Your claims about illegal immigration have serious flaws. You keep refusing to deal with these.\n \n \nConservatives believe that we need to maintain our interests in the middle east, while controlling our borders here at home.\n\n \n And guess where these interests got started? With Liberal Foreign Interventionists. But I agree that we need to maintain our interest in the middle east. What I dislike is people lying about what those actually are and why we went. If Bush just admitted that Iraq was for land to build American military bases to project American military power to ensure the future stability of the region in its context to supplies of hydrocarbons (LNG and petroleum), I'd be far happier instead of his bull**** about terrorism and WMD.\n \n \nLiberals believe we should abandon our involvement in the middle east to free up money so even more of it can be spent domestically, on things like giveaway programs to illegals, and subsequent givaway programs to Americans who have no job because of them.\n\n \n I'd ask you to provide proof of illegals taking jobs away from Americans, but you're like Archangel, incapable of providing evidence. So I won't even bother. \n \n \nOr government searches for alternative energy, when free market searches are more efficient, and actually work.\n\n \n Not really. Alternative energy has largely come from Federal and state grants in producing economical amounts. It simply isn't feasible to compete with fossil with the price per kilowatt without subsidies. Virtually every major alternative energy source is being partially funded through grants, tax credits or rebate from the government. The problem with our regulated market (face it, the US isn't a 'free market') is that giants like ExxonMobile simply buy up the patents to the alternative energy or hire all of the engineers doing it so the patents enter under the company's name due to corporate law codes. They are going to milk fossil for as long as possible before switching over to alternative and I don't blame them, it's a effective, yet ruthless strategy.\n \n \nYourself, The Wizard, and Duo Maxwell are all liberals. These forums certainly do have a lot of liberals! emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n So I'm a Pony and you're a rabbit? \n \n You still haven't addressed 1-4 so here they are again:\n \n 1) Illegal labor acts as a deflationary market force, reducing labor costs, leading to reduction in overall cost structure, allowing firms to reduce prices to customers or at least keep prices stable. Those $200 billion in 'suppressed wages' which make up the vast bulk of your overall number would have to be paid by you, me and everyone else. Adding $200 billion to the costs of the economy is never a good thing, especially when those increased wages would curtail American competitiveness.\n 2) Your numbers do not include the sales taxes and FICA that illegals and their employers pay. That alone should be a rather large offset to your claims.\n 3) Remittances are a good thing. Illegals, primarily Mexicans are coming to the US because of poor opportunities at home. Sending back money decreases the motivation for even more people to come as well as providing possible income for investment to create more jobs IN Mexico.\n 4) Iraq costs around $100 billion an year. Without the wages, total costs, assuming your numbers are correct, are a a mere 33 or so billion more then Iraq. The problem is that those costs to provide for illegals are usually state borne in cost, and most states are not borrowing billions daily to support them where the Federal Government is selling T-bills in huge numbers. $133 billion in tax and spend form is $133 billion. $100 billion in borrowed is not $100 billion, usually far, far, far more.

   "Paul does have some good ideas but he is unrealistic about them.\n\n \n Obviously. \n \n \nEnding a majority of foreign intervention is really not a bad thing (other than when required..ie genocide or something). Paul's ideas about decreasing government overnight are just dangerous and would send us into a depression.\n\n \n His basic idea is good, less government = better government which is more or less the anti-thesis of the GOP ideology now. His Cold Turkey idea is bad.\n \n \nFinally, he needs to back off the no taxes thing. In fact, they all do. We are up to our tree tops in debt and frankly are going to have to raise taxes and cut benefits...the very opposite of what people want.\n\n \n Agreed. Most anti-tax people are XXXXXX. True, high taxes are detrimental but a number of factors demand taxes. For one we need to pay for stuff, and monetary policy can only do so much. Some times we need fiscal policy to step in and slow a overheating economy, even if it is cumbersome and slow. What you don't see is diehard Republicans like Marc9000 arguing for debt reduction. It is as if the current Republican core has no understanding of economics and business at ALL. What I don't understand is how Wall Street tolerated that. Maybe Romney is a decent choice if it instills proper economic/business sense back into the core after 8 years of \"needs-daddy-to-pull-out-of-self-dug-grave.\" \n \n \nThe sad thing is, most Americans don't seem to see past tomorrow or remember yesterday and are selfish. So what do we elect? Someone who will cut taxes and raise benefits.\n\n \n What can I say? Americans are XXXXXX. We nominated Gore and Bush. That automatically proves we're XXXXXX. Then we nominated Kerry and Bush. Furthermore proof we shouldn't be allowed to vote. \n \n \nIf I were to run for president I would run on cutting taxes and raising benefits and then immediately shut down the government until they raised taxes (at least for some) and balanced the budget. Four years later I wouldn't even run but at least we'd be better off.\n\n \n You'd need to be a dictator for that though. One thing I think the government should mandate is a basic economics and accounting class in high school. Too many people don't realize that tax and spending of $50 is less costly then borrow and spend of $50. As much as Republicans bash Populist Economics, they sure have no problem embracing it.",

The current GOP is an embarrassment. One reason I actually like Mike Huckabee is that he doesn't align well with much of the GOP....I mean he raised taxes and gave tuition breaks to illegals but he did those because they were good ideas.

Just look at his campaign spending. But the point is, the republicans know how to win elections. You win by saying \" I will cut taxes and raise benefits\". While this does win elections and has been the republicans platform for years it is cowardice and poor leadership.

The republicans have talked a lot to appeal to Christians, fiscal conservatives, and foreign policy conservatives but have failed to deliver anything and don't practice the values of any of those groups.

I gotta tell ya, its a scary situation.

Most republicans in Congress have no morals, no fiscal responsibility, and no sense of foreign culture. Can anyone even disagree with that and be taken seriously?\n\n \n This is wrong. You can cut taxes and raise benifits. You jsut print more money. Then when the inevitable effects of having opverprinted start to show up, you print even more. Didn't you hear pelosi the other day? We are going to print 150 billion as an economic stimulus package and then if that does not work, we will print even more for a bigger package. I finally figured out the goal here. We are trying to compete with yugoslavia for hyperinflation title. Yugoslavia enjoyed 5 quadrillion (that is a 5 with 15 zeros after it) inflation in less than 5 years. If they can do it, imagine what we in the US can do with a little good old fashioned american inginuity and even faster printing presses!!!\n \n \nI have to admit I supported Bush when he ran the first time but I claim youth and inexperience for that (stupid college kids) :p It is actually embarrassing to even admit now.

I was explaining mark to model valuation and how they are contributing to the problems we are seeing now in the financial markets to somebody the other day. HE finally caught on and said \"So, basically, like Citibank is rich becuase they say they are, but really nobody knows, and they are probably lying?\" \n \n Yep\n \n I did have a question for you about mark to model accounting. I know (because I have done it) that at one time accountants were not too strict about the model used. Typically the way it worked (literally) is you pull a number you like out of your butt, give it to the accountant, indemnify them against any penalties, and they use your number.

Ironically it's a great way to shore up the entitlement programs as there is no outflow to these workers!\n\n If they aren't filing returns than at least they aren't collecting EIC and child tax credits for being poor.\n This issue is, they don't have to have FICA taken out of their checks to begin with.\n Just put down 'exempt' or 12+ credits for deduction purposes on W2's.\n Voila, no FICA (or even state taxes) going out of your pay checks.\n Just SS and Medicare.\n \n I'm not saying this happens in all (or even most) situations...most are too stupid to realize it but there's no guarantee that FICA is coming from all those 11 million illegals. Less so if they're ever paid under the table.\n \n \nAgain, why do you think they are filling individual 1040s? Oh wait, they aren't.\n\n Read the above.\n Has nothing to do with 1040's and all to do with W2's.\n You can claim your dog, you neighbors dog and all the ET's in your back yard on the W2's. Just for us legals, your 1040's better be in order. \n For illegals...why file a 1040 if you had nothing taken out to begin with?\n As I said, we're lucky they don't.\n That'd be 10 million+ who'd get all their deductions back PLUS the EIC freebies. ~3-$5K a family per year. *shudder*\n \n \nOf course. I assume you're joking about the annexation...\n\n We can't enslave them...we, we could but too many goody-goodies would get all mad.\n But, what's wrong with the United States of North America? ;)\n \n \nNeither did Marc. Not surprisingly.\n\n \n Just felt like chiming in.\n \n And don't tell any illegals about not paying FICA if they have 'legit' paychecks.\n We'd have a serious problem then.\n \n My only personal problems with illegals is going to a fast food joint and seeing 100% Hispanic workers and Gringo managers... \n \n \n Anyway...any ideas on how I can precent Uncle Sam from taking that SS and Medicare out of my paycheck?\n I'm not going to be getting any of it back.\n I hate HATE HATE old people the way it is and think they should be kept at home tending to the grand kids before being put on an iceberg for the polar bears.",

   "Some companies are close to monopolies in how much they dominate.\n\n \n Such as the energy industry and software operating, neither of which I recall use illegal labor...\n \n \nI'm really not an expert in how those who use illegals operate.\n Mostly going on what I've 'heard' about the restaurant, construction and meat-packing industries.\n\n \n Also agricultural. Vine based foods. Restaurant, meat packing and agricultural, aside from niche markets are largely based on price points, especially when many of the buyers are groceries who have slim margins. You can't compete with other strawberry producers if you're charging far then they are. Some of the biggest pushes in these industries (particularly meat packing) is cost control. I know people who don't eat meat after studying some of the side effects of cost control in meat packing. \n \n \nPoint taken and you learn something new every day. That still leaves 35 states with out a food tax. --huh, I even visited several of those southern states 2 years ago...should have checked my food bills closer. :p\n And I can see why some would support a national sales tax over an income based one (I don't).\n\n \n Well, some states should have sales taxes, such as the state of Oregon due to their pathetic education funding model. \n \n \nStill, the money sent out is nothing we're collecting on.\n\n \n I don't know about that. 11 million illegals, at $3000 in fica a year, that's $33 billion. Then we have to consider how many jobs are being created by the saved money that would have gone to higher wages now being used in different investments and the associated state, county and federal taxes gathered from them. This subject is rather complicated. I have a fair amount of economics background and the complexity astounds me. Merely dealing with the opportunity cost of not hiring illegals could fill a book. People who try to cast the entire debate as a simple black and white issue annoy me.\n \n \nThe point is, most illegals live very cheaply in the US and contribute little to it compared to legals. More so if they're sending their money back home.\n\n \n Maybe. Again hard to say. But on remittances, if they are able to create jobs in Mexico, is that an bad thing? Part of what keeps Cuba running is the billions in remittances from Cubans-Americans in Florida.\n \n \nAlso, the nation becomes less self reliant if we can't make our own goods and service our own industry without the need for foreign labor.\n\n \n That's rather a minor point, especially when the labor is unskilled. Unskilled labor is easy to find, and it's not hard for a skilled laborer to do unskilled labor. A bigger point is our nation's inability to create large numbers of skilled laborers, such as scientists and engineers. Did you know the vast majority of science, math and engineering masters' and phd students are foreign students? That's frightening. That's an far bigger concern as it affects the future of the nation to compete on the high value, complex products and services level.\n \n \nMakes it more that America is just a giant leech proped up with foreign labor and foreign goods.\n\n \n This isn't an new thing. This was happening in the 80s.\n \n \nWe seem to exist to 'serve' each other most of the time.\n Pardon me...would you happen to have any grey Poupon?\n\n \n Well that seems to be the thought in modern development theories. That rich nations eventually align their economies away from manufacturing and production to service and R&D. India of course breaks this model, but it still is rather valid as the EU and the US are currently doing this.\n \n \nOh they do.\n But as I said, you can have 0 FICA withheld from your pay checks.\n I don't have anything taken out of mine at all. I just have to ensure that come tax time, Uncle Sam gets what's his. So, I get to collect interest on it rather than the US.\n\n \n Of course. Withholding is a free loan to Uncle Sam. But Withholding is suppose to keep irresponsible people from having a huge tax bill they can't pay. But Illegals don't file and I seriously doubt they fill out their own withholding forms. Most of these people can't read English and god knows how many Americans are baffled by their own tax forms. Plus you're missing the key issue here. If a large amount of people employed by company X who had zero withholding and paid nothing in April was noticed and will surely be given the easy reference system of the IRS, then that employer would be essentially screwed as they'd be in for an audit likely as well as fines. Remember that illegal employers want to keep as low a profile as possible.\n \n \nNope, I didn't assume anything.\n If they aren't following the laws they aren't following the laws.\n\n \n hence why we call them illegal.\n \n \nThe article deals with SS and Medicare...not FICA.\n We know where SS and Medicare go to.\n\n \n SS and medicare are usually referred like FICA for tax purposes, even if SS goes to the general fund. It's not a big difference. All of that is withholding.\n \n \nIf they aren't filing returns than at least they aren't collecting EIC and child tax credits for being poor.\n\n \n Then that's a good thing isn't it?\n \n \nThis issue is, they don't have to have FICA taken out of their checks to begin with.\n Just put down 'exempt' or 12+ credits for deduction purposes on W2's.\n Voila, no FICA (or even state taxes) going out of your pay checks.\n Just SS and Medicare.\n\n \n But these people 1) can't read english and 2) likely don't understand a tax form and 3) are not likely to even fill out their own stuff. It's a stretch to think that they would do this. Especially when it takes time out of employers to teach them this and it's even worse when the guy they hire probably won't be there tomorrow. It's just not worth the employer's time to educate.\n \n \nI'm not saying this happens in all (or even most) situations...most are too stupid to realize it but there's no guarantee that FICA is coming from all those 11 million illegals. Less so if they're ever paid under the table.\n\n \n From all 11 million? Probably not. From a fair portion, probably. If I was employing a large number of illegals who on their forms cited ME as their employer, I'd try to minimize my risk of being discovered. And remember that many of these employers don't care about the workers, they just want lower costs. \n \n \nHas nothing to do with 1040's and all to do with W2's.\n You can claim your dog, you neighbors dog and all the ET's in your back yard on the W2's. Just for us legals, your 1040's better be in order. \n For illegals...why file a 1040 if you had nothing taken out to begin with?\n As I said, we're lucky they don't.\n That'd be 10 million+ who'd get all their deductions back PLUS the EIC freebies. ~3-$5K a family per year. *shudder*\n\n \n Read the above.\n \n \n We can't enslave them...we, we could but too many goody-goodies would get all mad.\n But, what's wrong with the United States of North America? ;)\n \n \nAnd don't tell any illegals about not paying FICA if they have 'legit' paychecks.\n We'd have a serious problem then.\n\n \n Only for a while. I suspect after the problem gets too large that a crackdown on illegal employment will begin.\n \n \nAnyway...any ideas on how I can precent Uncle Sam from taking that SS and Medicare out of my paycheck?\n\n \n Die...? There were rumors of getting out of SS but it's probably just rumors.\n Well, if you don't make money, you can't pay SS and medicare. But that's tax evasion. If you put 0 withholding, and then file that you made zero, you'd get out. I think even if you make any amount you still have to pay SS and medicare. But there's no way you can make your income go to 0 legally.\n \n IMO, by the time anyone under 35 retires, SS will either be defunct, or be a shadow of its former self, with high taxes and low payouts. Therefore, IMO, one should contribute the absolute least amount possible as one will either being getting nothing or a tiny amount no matter how much you contribute. You're better off investing yourself. Real estate has always been a good idea if you can somewhat time the market. I bet you good money that there are a number of wealthy people who will be buying up houses and land real soon and then will turn them around when the market is back up for astronomical amounts of money. That's their retirement funds.\n \n \nI'm not going to be getting any of it back.\n \n I hate HATE HATE old people the way it is and think they should be kept at home tending to the grand kids before being put on an iceberg for the polar bears.\n\n \n Maybe 5% of everything you put in. So over the course of your lifetime, if you contributed $100,000 you'd get $5,000 back. Of course inflation would have made it like $500 by then. great isn't it?",

   "I like paul an what he stands for, but I count on the fact that if he were elected, he could not actually do most of the things he wants to do the way he wants to do them. \n \n What I dislike about huckabee is his base, which is more or less the same as bush's....evangelicans. Bush has catered to the evangelicals during his entire time in office and look where it has brought us. Have you ever met a fiscally conservative evangelical, or even one who really understands how our economy operates? I am afraid that if huckabe ended up in the whitehouse we woudl essentially end up with a fiscal policy that is crafted to make people like bassman and archie happy. Then we would REALLY be screwed.\n The sad thing he, Bush only talked about catering to the evangelicals but never did. Bush's base was more than that anyway. He got the ill-informed vote which is made up of much more than evangelicals.\n \n Have a met a fiscally conservative evangelical? Yes actually. Many of them. In fact, you might classify me as one. All evangelical means (or should mean) is that you actually believe what you have faith in. I agree that many evangelicals miss the boat on a lot of the issues. It is important to get rid of abortion but at the same time you have to realize being fiscally responsible is also a moral in the Bible. To think one is more important than the other is hypocritical on the part of any Christian. \n \n I do understand your fear about Huckabee so I just resort to what he did in Arkansas and what Bush did in Texas. Bush's programs in Texas failed and people still liked him because he was a \"good ol' boy\". Huckabee actually had to work with people that hated him and he didn't have the yes men Bush had. This led to non-party based ideas that actually worked. \n \n Oddly enough, the fear you have with Huckabee is the fear I have with Paul. Paul's base is not exactly a great one either (college kids). The media seems to peg these candidates this way creating fears that may very well be unfounded. If you ever hear Huckabee talk about issues he isn't preaching the Bible but if you heard the Media talk about him you think that is all he does.\n \n \nThis is wrong. You can cut taxes and raise benifits. You jsut print more money. \nI stand corrected...sadly haha. \n \n\n Then when the inevitable effects of having opverprinted start to show up, you print even more. Didn't you hear pelosi the other day? We are going to print 150 billion as an economic stimulus package and then if that does not work, we will print even more for a bigger package. I finally figured out the goal here. We are trying to compete with yugoslavia for hyperinflation title. Yugoslavia enjoyed 5 quadrillion (that is a 5 with 15 zeros after it) inflation in less than 5 years. If they can do it, imagine what we in the US can do with a little good old fashioned american inginuity and even faster printing presses!!!\nProbably get to the point where you loss value by getting dollar bills. And no, I don't listen to Pelosi very often because it is often times some incompetent comment meant to give herself a power trip fix. It's like listening to Trent Lott. <shivers<\n \n \nI voted for him the first time as well. I voted for Badnarack the second time. This time around I am probably not even going to vote. \nI wanted to vote for Badnarack but the Kerry fear got to me. He actually wasn't that bad. I actually helped campaign for a libertarian candidate for Virginia governor some years ago...wasn't that bad. The only down side was I am handing out flyers that said \"Reed's Reeferendum\" or some drug reference like that. They gotta back off that stance if they ever want to be taken seriously.\n \n\n I think people are finally starting to cath on to that. I was explaining mark to model valuation and how they are contributing to the problems we are seeing now in the financial markets to somebody the other day. HE finally caught on and said \"So, basically, like Citibank is rich becuase they say they are, but really nobody knows, and they are probably lying?\" \nRemember our conversation on SIV's (and the failure or Super SIVs afterwards)? Yeah, that is only gonna get worse for CitiBank. I actually have my checking account with Wachovia and I'm scared about that. \n \n I read an article the other day about how Auditors (and accountants I guess) can't screw up again. Well guess what, nothing has changed in the accounting profession except we have more information on internal controls (and those are being backed off of). The issues that brought down Enron still exist with things like the SIVs and independence issues with auditors and companies. You have four major auditing firms. You don't think that creates an oligopoly for how things are done and what rules are created? Of course it does and it creates an environment of the big four having too much power and too friendly of a relation with the companies. I think the auditors forget that you work for the investors not the company. \n \n \nI did have a question for you about mark to model accounting. I know (because I have done it) that at one time accountants were not too strict about the model used. Typically the way it worked (literally) is you pull a number you like out of your butt, give it to the accountant, indemnify them against any penalties, and they use your number. I have heard that some new standards are essentially putting an end to that. Any truth to the rumor?\nIf you read an audit report this is fairly clear. In short, most audit reports will say management is responsible for the numbers and it is the job of the auditor to just express an opinion on those numbers. This means basically that if the number is wrong blame the company. The main problem is with estimates. Companies really can just pull something out of their butt and auditors generally go with it. I'm not sure if the AICPA or PCAOB are addressing this or not. I don't believe standard 5 from the PCAOB addressed it but the AICPA has some new AU's coming out that might. I generally deal with GAGAS more anyway...and good thing because GAAS is screwed up right now.\n \n Have no fear that we will repeat the mistakes of the past.",
