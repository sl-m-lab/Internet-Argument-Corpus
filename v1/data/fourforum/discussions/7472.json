Below is the transcript of the email, just wanted to point out how un-christian he really is.\n \n ----- Original Message ----- \n From: Robbie Blankenship \n To: joe.f@cedarpark.org \n Sent: Saturday, January 28, 2006 5:12 PM\n Subject: Gary Marriage\n \n \n One day you will be judged, and the hatred and ignorance you display will not be looked upon kindly. If you want to use the Bible to discriminate against homosexuals, make sure you also follow all of the other barbaric 'rules' of the Bible. I'm sure you pick and choose, that's the way of the so called christians these days. \n \n You make me sick. \n \n \n ----- Original Message ----\n From: Joe Fuiten <joe.f@cedarpark.org<\n To: Robbie Blankenship \n Sent: Saturday, January 28, 2006 8:46:49 PM\n Subject: Re: Gary Marriage\n \n \n I am not sure why you blame me for your condition.\n \n \n ----- Original Message ----- \n From: Robbie Blankenship \n To: joe.f@cedarpark.org \n Sent: Saturday, January 28, 2006 10:38:48 PM\n Subject: Gary Marriage\n \n \n First of all it is not a condition. A condition would describe a flaw in ones self. You could say that you have a condition for example, for your expressions of hate and intolerance. If I have a condition, then I guess you could also call your heterosexuality a condition as well. If you are in fact heterosexual. I find that many that speak out against homosexuality are homosexual themselves. If you truly understood God's world, which it is clear you do not, you would understand that a person's homosexuality is no different than ones heterosexuality. You and people like you are the cause of many young peoples suicides due to the lack of acceptance and understanding. I hope you can sleep at night. I can tell you this for sure. Homosexual's will have the same rights including marriage in my lifetime. No matter what you and people like you have to say about it. Religion of any faith has no business in our government and our constitution will prevail in the end. Amendment or no amendment. I hope you live long enough to watch this happen, it will. \n God does not make mistakes, I am no mistake. God loves and accepts me and looks down upon those like yourself for your cruel and hating nature. I know this to be true.\n I hope you do not get up and try to preach morals and values to your congregation since you apparently can not possibly grasp such things yourself. \n \n You should be ashamed of yourself and may God help you. \n \n Robbie",

   "My Impression of the situation would be that neither side can understand the others view.\n \n Gay unions are fairly new concepts in society. Most religions won't recognize their existance, as well as the moral majority of the U.S. voters. You aren't being recognized as soon as you like. Your going at it from every angle you can think of, but it comes back to the one hurdle that is bigger than all the rest.\n \n The Rev. is telling you his view, how he was taught, from the book, that Gay sex is a sin. Every time his teacher, the bible, address the subject, it never changes. the wording may be different, but the message is the same. His actions are strictly outlined in church doctrine , he couldn't change his position if he wanted to.\n \n Marriage is strictly between a man and woman. They are endorsed by God Himself. Every religion I am familiar with believe creation started with a man and woman. That created ceromonies and rituals with a man and woman, who were blessed to go forth and multiply. They were encourged to have sex. When the church performs a ceremony. they bless the couple in the name of God.\n \n The blessing itself is the hurdle. Thats something he can't do.\n \n He mentioned your condition. Maybe he's not sure what to call it. I'm not sure I do at times.",

   "I am not asking for the church or any religion to endorse, for lack of a better word, a gay marriage. \n What I am asking for is civil rights. The same rights any other couple receive under the law. Religion has nothing to do with it. \n \n As far as understanding, it really is not difficult. I am not heterosexual, however I understand and accept heterosexuality. \n \n If those who oppose or don't understand could accept that fact the homosexuality is something one is born with and not something that one chooses, maybe it would make more sense to them. Me trying to explain to you why I am homosexual would be like you trying to explain to me why you are heterosexual. Homosexuals no more chose to be homosexual any more than an african american chose the color or their skin. \n \n Just look at your own life, your own desires, your own sexuality as it developed and evolved throughout your life. There is no difference other than mine are not towards the opposite sex, but otherwise exactly the same.",
