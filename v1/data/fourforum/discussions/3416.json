   "I am Pro-Choice and I want you all to take a look at this thought -\n \n Many teenagers get pregnant..many times on accident. You can take protecion and still get pregnant, you can be raped(and maybe never report it but it was still rape), or maybe just make a stupid mistake(teenage years are the time to learn from your mistakes). But if a teenager does get pregnant and abortion is not an option because it is outlawed then they will, of course, have to go through with the birth. Then, what happens to the baby? The teenager may decide to keep the baby, but think about how this childs life will be with a teenage parent! It will not be a good life! The teenager will most likely not have enough money or time or effort to support the child into a good life. Don't you think it would be better then to get rid of the child before it has to go through that life? The teenager may also put the baby up for adoption. Living in that adoption center or in a foster home is not the life for anyone. Again, dont you want to save this un-born child from this kind of horrible life? Also, dont you want to save the teenager from the life of a teenage parent? \n \n Another thought - \n \n The fetus is never born, it will never know what its like to be living in the world, so you shouldn't be so worried about it!\n \n Last thought -\n \n Its a girls body...let her CHOOSE what she wants to do with it! It is her baby too! You gave women the right to choose when giving them the right to vote, give them the right to choose with abortion as well!",

   "Obviously, if some people recognize a fetus as a form of human life, then killing it is as wrong as killing any other human for any reason. If some others DON'T recognize a fetus (unborn) as a form of human life, then a woman's regulation of her own body (to abort or not) can't be challenged.\n\n \n Most people recognize the fetus as a form of life. I don't know where you get this from. It is not considered a person under the law.\n \n \n\n IMO, there is no grey area in this debate. Both positions are logical and rational. However, I believe there are many who have reservations about aborting a pregnency. It seems to me that those people are making life and death decisions based on the opinion/rational of only one of the two people involved. Who are we - any of us - to prejudge the value/worth/sucess of an innocent life based on our own fears or worries. Should all minority children be aborted because they will probably suffer from discrimination and/or poverty? Of course not!\n\n \n Eh? Why did you suddenly start with forcing abortions? Who in the world wants to do that? Certainly no-one who is pro-choice.\n \n Both positions may have logic, but the pro-life side is a lot more cruel and oppressive, imo. To use your words, who are we - any of us - to force a woman to continue a pregnancy that she does not want? Who are we to tell a woman \"Deal with it\" with a pregnancy that, to her, she has good reasons not to continue? That is evil and oppressive, imo.\n \n \n\n Here's another analogy to ponder...... Many environmentalists decry the destruction of the rain forests because there may be undiscovered plants/animals/cures ect. that may never be discovered because of the destruction of those things before their WORTH can be realized. BUT WAIT! What if the baby that is aborted today would eventually make that valuable discovery/contribution?\n\n \n It doesn't matter, if it is inside her body and she does not want it there, it is getting out. \n \n \n\n To those pro-choice folks. You are on firm ground in your position, if you believe that life does not begin until birth. I urge you to consider that that very bedrock of your position could be false. I wonder if my bedrock belief is also flawed, but even if I am wrong, no one dies.\n\n \n I have never said that life does not begin until birth. \n \n What is your bedrock belief?",

   "The polite way to refer to a pregnant woman years ago was \"with child\". There's a child (or more) growing in the womb of every pregnant female (expectant MOTHER). She's expecting a child to be issued. While there is no such thing as an undead corpse, there certainly are quite a few unborn children. (These are just children who haven't been born yet.)\n\n \n Yes, that is/was the PC way of saying it. In an abortion debate, we are arguing legal aspects, medical aspects, biologic aspects, etc. To use correct terms for different stages of development and that have boundaries (such as birth) it is easier to debate. Using emotional terms like \"babies\" does not contribute to the debate and is dishonest debating, imo.\n \n There is no such thing as an undead corpse? Certainly there is, every one of us is. We are just corpses that aren't dead yet :p Just as an \"unborn child\" is a child that hasn't been born yet. It is a rediculous thing to say. Say what it is not what it will be.\n \n \n\n If you don't think the government can control your body, read about the high school student who was refused admittance to school because he would not remove his piercings. (He had an eyelid and lower lip \"decorated\" with stainless steel balls.) The school board concluded he was a major distraction.\n\n \n That's not exactly a good analogy. A better analogy would be if the gov't forces him to keep his peircings when he didn't want them anymore.\n \n In your example, he could refuse to go there and keep his decorations. A pregnant woman would have no other choice if you had your way.\n \n \n\n Regarding the drugs, it's not illegal to be under the influence of them. It's illegal to possess them and to do certain things while under the influence of them.\n\n \n Woohoo emoticon_xclown",
