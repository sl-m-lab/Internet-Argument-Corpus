   "What we see in France -- and saw in New Orleans -- is only a foretaste of the non-White violence coming to America.\n \n The riots in France spread to other parts of Europe. The Arabs and sub-Saharan Africans who are displaying their cultural and genetic proclivities for upheaval and chaos have now escalated the conflict with cries of Jihad against the West. French police have discovered a bomb-making factory in Paris. Some of the rioters are chanting \"it's Baghdad here.\" That is ominous news, even if the riots subside.\n \n Cast your eyes inward now, to the United States. Mexican invaders are now telling us that much the same thing can -- and probably will -- happen here. Insurrection is on their minds. The leading Mestizo advocacy groups, La Voz de Aztlan and MEChA, have vowed in no uncertain terms to 'reclaim' the southwest United States through either high birthrates, violence, or both.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=6890\n \n Or listen:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/docs/audio/fr20051114.mp3\n \n \n \n .",

   "I'd like to counter what some of you in this thread have suggested, and that is that New Orleans is not a racist town.\n \n I wholeheartedly disagree. If you've ever gotten to know the average white person in New Orleans you will learn very quickly that they are quite racist.\n \n But it's racism that's not so much concerned with lynching or segregation, but more along the lines of complaining about blacks, whom most whites in New Orleans (actually the outlying areas) would call niggers, and making them the source for all social ills. \n \n But now that I think of it, most white people in New Orleans would very much welcome the rebirth of segregation.\n \n And one of you said that Paris was a French name.

(They are mentioned in Caesar's \"Gallic Wars\").\n \n Some of these continental Parisi emigated to England and settled on lands just north of where I'm living right now. \n \n I don't know how Paris the Trojan, who abducted Helen, got his name.
