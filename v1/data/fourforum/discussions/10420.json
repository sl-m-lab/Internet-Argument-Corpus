   "http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070925/29448_Study:_Christianity_No_Longer_Looks_Like_Jesus.htm\n \nYoung Americans today are more skeptical and resistant to Christianity than were people of the same age just a decade ago, says a new study.\n \n Negative perceptions toward the Christian faith have outweighed the positive as a growing percentage of younger Americans associate with a faith outside Christianity.\n \n Only 16 percent of non-Christians aged 16 to 29 years old said they have a \"good impression\" of Christianity, according to a report released Monday by The Barna Group. A decade ago, the vast majority of Americans outside the Christian faith, including young people, felt favorably toward Christianity's role in society,\n \n Young people have an even lesser positive impression of evangelicals. Only 3 percent of 16- to 29-year-olds who are not of the Christian faith express favorable views of evangelicals. In the previous generation, 25 percent of young people had positive associations toward evangelicals.\n \n \"[Evangelicals] have always been viewed with skepticism in the broader culture,\" said the Barna report. \"However, those negative views are crystallizing and intensifying among young non-Christians.\"\n \n Common negative perceptions among non-Christians is that present-day Christianity is judgmental (87 percent), hypocritical (85 percent), old-fashioned (78 percent), and too involved in politics (75 percent).\n \n For the most part, Christians are aware of the greater degree of criticism toward Christianity. According to the study, 91 percent of the nation's evangelicals believe that \"Americans are becoming more hostile and negative toward Christianity.\"\n \n Half of senior pastors say that \"ministry is more difficult than ever before because people are increasingly hostile and negative toward Christianity.\"\n \n There were also some widely held favorable perceptions toward Christianity including beliefs that Christianity teaches the same basic ideas as other religions (82 percent), has good values and principles (76 percent), is friendly (71 percent), and is a faith they respect (55 percent).\n \n Criticism, however, was not limited to young people outside the Christian faith. Half of young churchgoers said they perceive Christianity to be judgmental, hypocritical and too political. Also, one-third said it was old-fashioned and out of touch with reality.\n \n Moreover, the study showed a new image attached to the Christian faith that is growing in prominence over the last decade. Overall, 91 percent of young non-Christians and 80 percent of young churchgoers say present-day Christianity is \"anti-homosexual.\"\n \n \"As the research probed this perception, non-Christians and Christians explained that beyond their recognition that Christians oppose homosexuality, they believe that Christians show excessive contempt and unloving attitudes towards gays and lesbians,\" the Barna report stated.\n \n Young Christians largely criticize the church, saying it has made homosexuality a \"bigger sin\" than anything else and that the church has not helped them apply the biblical teaching on homosexuality to their friendships with gays and lesbians.\n \n Among other common impressions, 23 percent of young non-Christians said \"Christianity is changed from what it used to be\" and \"Christianity in today's society no longer looks like Jesus.\" Young born-again Christians were just as likely to say the same (22 percent).\n \n \"That's where the term 'unChristian' came from,\" said David Kinnaman, president of The Barna Group who presents the findings in his new book unChristian. \"Young people are very candid. In our interviews, we kept encountering young people - both those inside the church and outside of it - who said that something was broken in the present-day expression of Christianity. Their perceptions about Christianity were not always accurate, but what surprised me was not only the severity of their frustration with Christians, but also how frequently young born again Christians expressed some of the very same comments as young non-Christians.\"\n \n Research further revealed that those outside of Christian faith have had significant experience with Christians and Christian churches. On average, young non-Christians said they have five friends who are Christians; more than four out of five have attended a Christian church for a period of at least six months in the past; and half have previously considered becoming a Christian.\n \n \"Older generations more easily dismiss the criticism of those who are outsiders,\" Kinnaman said. \"But we discovered that young leaders and young Christians are more aware of and concerned about the views of outsiders, because they are more likely to interact closely with such people. Their life is more deeply affected by the negative image of Christianity. For them, what Christianity looks like from an outsider's perspective has greater relevance, because outsiders are more likely to be schoolmates, colleagues, and friends.\"\n \n The declining reputation of Christianity correlates with shifting faith allegiances of Americans, the study pointed out.\n \n Each new generation has a larger share of people who are not Christians, which includes atheists, agnostics, people with no faith orientation or people associated with another faith). Among adults over the age of 40, only about one-quarter associate with a non-Christian faith compared to 40 percent of 16- to 29-year-olds.\n \n \"This is not a passing fad wherein young people will become 'more Christian' as they grow up,\" according to the report. \"While Christianity remains the typical experience and most common faith in America, a fundamental recalibration is occurring within the spiritual allegiance of America's upcoming generations.\"\n",

But I suspect the problem of 'decline' is also linked to an intolerance problem in modern society as much as Christianity shooting itself in the foot.

There is no good reason for there b hostility toward religion or religious people. People should be able to co-exist and get along with disagreement.\n \n Also, the decline and increase of Christianity depends enormously on what areas of the world it's in. For instance, in Latin America, it's definitely on the rise. In Europe, it's on the decline. Another thing to keep in mind is that, historically, Christianity has pretty much always been an ebb and flow sort of thing in Europe and the U.S. It would decline some, then increase with large-scale revivals and so forth (what's been called the 'the Great Awakening'). Then it might decline again. It's been cyclical. So it's no surprise really that it would do this. Lot's of things return people to religion: large scale catastrophes, wars, revivalist movements, general discontent, etc. If it declines, religion will eventually come back around.

Because something's bad (which is a good sort of intolerance) or because it's different (that's the bad sort).\n\n \n Or because their perceptions have changed. In this case, elements of some in the religion have caused/contributed to that, as we've agreed on. But since that intolerance is sometimes held against ALL of Christianity rather than just those elements which would have contributed to it, then I have to conclude there's something else causing the intolerance too. It's not ALL something Christianity brings on itself. I think the question you need to ask is, how is it ever good to show intolerance toward the religion of a person presenting you no harm whatsoever, or no harm to anyone? Because that's part of what's going on here. When someone thinks ALL Christianity it bad, when in fact some elements of it have not been bad and contributed to good, then there's something going on there more than just \"they-bring-it-on-themselves\". The person showing intolerance is being intolerant in a bad way.\n \n Many people don't ONLY react, in society. That would be more ideal if that were the case and people always did that only, but they don't. They really do sometimes have irrational biases, even towards Christianity. I get the impression that anytime someone refers to society having a negative view of religion, you automatically assume it's a reaction, with no possibility of fault on those having that negative view. \n \n Let's change the religion for a moment just for the sake of analogy, so maybe you can see what I'm talking about. Take Islam. Is it really a good form of intolerance to assume Islam in general--the whole religion--is a bad thing, when in fact there are many members of the religion that are peaceful? Is it really good to assume Islam is going to result in something bad, and say, start assuming every person wearing a turban that walks through an airport is dangerous? Islam too has experienced a negativity in society, particularly in the west. Do you really think that's ALL the fault of Islam? Sure, some of it is. But haven't some people outside of Islam gotten carried away and bad intolerance crept in? I think it's both. And the same applies in the case of Christianity.",

   " Or because their perceptions have changed. \n\n But why?!? The obvious answer would be because what they're looking at has changed. You're implying another motive, but you're not actually supplying one. \n \n \n\n In this case, elements of some in the religion have caused/contributed to that, as we've agreed on. But since that intolerance is sometimes held against ALL of Christianity rather than just those elements which would have contributed to it, then I have to conclude there's something else causing the intolerance too. \n\n Well, no you don't. What you're trying to say here, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that you think people are taking the specific and applying it to the general, right? That doesn't imply another motive, just normal behavior for more people.\n \n \n\n how is it ever good to show intolerance toward the religion of a person presenting you no harm whatsoever, or no harm to anyone? \n\n Just wanted to highlight that as an example of a leading question. ;) \n \n \n\n Because that's part of what's going on here. When someone thinks ALL Christianity it bad, when in fact some elements of it have not been bad and contributed to good, then there's something going on there more than just \"they-bring-it-on-themselves\". The person showing intolerance is being intolerant in a bad way.\n \n\n Not that I necessarily agree with that conclusion, but you raise a valid point. It cannot be questioned that alot of negative stuff is being generated in the name of Christianity these days. I think you'll also have to agree that not a lot of Christians are making much of a fuss about it, even if they don't presonally agree. So at what point is a group forced to accept responsibility for it's members doing things they don't like. If a significant portion of a group you belong to is doing something you don't like, and you do nothing, how responsible are you? You seem to be saying \"not at all\". I disagree. I think you are responsible for either trying to pull your group back in line, or disassociating yourself from that group. If you do and say nothing then you are agreeing by default.\n \n \n\n I get the impression that anytime someone refers to society having a negative view of religion, you automatically assume it's a reaction, with no possibility of fault on those having that negative view. \n\n Whereas you always assume it's never religion's fault. There, we've analyzed each other and contributed zero to the debate. We done now?\n \n \n\n But haven't some people outside of Islam gotten carried away and bad intolerance crept in?

Your whole argument is based on the idea that society is prejudiced against Christianity, and that some of these prejudices aren't Christianity's fault. Until you stop dancing around the question and say where this intolerance does come from your argument has no substance, it smacks of diversion and evasion.\n\n \n You already said earlier where it comes from: the fact something is different. Religion IS a very different thing to non-religious people. Just like prejudice comes from the fact something is different in many other issues in culture. You might as well be asking where intolerance against blacks come from, or against gays. There IS no rational basis for the intolerance in any of these cases, so naturally you aren't going to get a rational reason. You should be asking someone who has such intolerance, like Samiinh or Thelmoose where that intolerance toward religion comes from, not someone that doesn't have such intolerance. Of course they'll tell you that \"Christians brought it on themselves\" because that response doesn't require self-reflection, just as many people prejudiced against other groups in the past have said it was only the fault of the groups experiencing intolerance, not those expressing the intolerance as well. That's not \"dancing around any question\"--you are asking for a rational answer over something for which there's no rational reason to begin with. It's like asking a gay person to say where homophobia comes from. Well, who knows? Maybe it was the person's upbringing. Maybe they are just a mean-spirited person. There are many possible reasons for such intolerance, but none of them good ones. \n \n And I'd also like to add that it's really not a good reason for it if it's the fault of Christians themselves. We're in agreement that Christians have brought some of it on themselves, but really, that's no good excuse for intolerance toward Christians either. Just like it would be unreasonable to hold intolerance toward gays because someone had a bad experience with some gay people once, or because a gay rights leader said something that ticked a lot of people off. Doesn't mean, of course that Christians shouldn't work to fix their problems individually, and work harder to live more benevolent lives. \n \n Now, per your previous post which I'm just now getting a chance to respond to ...\n \n \nWhat you're trying to say here, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that you think people are taking the specific and applying it to the general, right? That doesn't imply another motive, just normal behavior for more people.\n\n \n So you feel it's normal behavior for people to hold the problems of a few against a whole group of people instead of the few that messed up? Do you realise that's not a very rational approach, and more along the lines of what many groups that have experienced prejudice down through the years have had to deal with?\n \n \nIt cannot be questioned that alot of negative stuff is being generated in the name of Christianity these days. I think you'll also have to agree that not a lot of Christians are making much of a fuss about it, even if they don't presonally agree. So at what point is a group forced to accept responsibility for it's members doing things they don't like. If a significant portion of a group you belong to is doing something you don't like, and you do nothing, how responsible are you? You seem to be saying \"not at all\". I disagree. I think you are responsible for either trying to pull your group back in line, or disassociating yourself from that group. If you do and say nothing then you are agreeing by default.\n\n \n Well, Christianity is not a club with membership and so forth. It's not like we all carry membership cards and pay dues. It's like many other things--individuals act a certain way, and those individuals should be held accountable by society. You can't \"fix\" something that's an action someone else is doing. Being a Christian simply means they hold to belief in Christ and claim to have a relationship with Him; your request to pull the group back in line is like someone asking an atheist to pull other atheists back in line--it doesn't work like that. People have their own opinions and views and aren't accountable to other people. \n \n Now it IS an option to disassociate. But I'd contend that some of that is going on, and that's one reason there are so many different denominations in Christianity. Groups disassociated with another that they disagreed with. And in fact, there are groups that have disassociated over THESE issues (that brought about the issues raised in the article). For instance, there has been a split in the the Anglican church that is happening still right now. Unitarians broke off long ago over issues similar. And lots of people in Christianity have condemned things said by Falwell, Phelps, and other hateful figures in the religion. So disassociation has been going on, but you're viewing Christianity as if it hasn't. That tells me that there's something more there causing you to do so: prejudice.\n \n There is one other thing I need to point out, and that's in regards to your erroneous comment that by doing and saying nothing, \"you are agreeing by default.\" This is simply not true in many cases. There are people who wish to stay completely out of issues such as these who are Christians. They are focused on other matters such as the gospel or simply worshiping Christ, and aren't about the business of worrying about what other Christian leaders say, pro OR con. Saying nothing does not necessarily equate to agreement, and you shouldn't assume it does. Take, for example, Amish and Mennonite groups. They haven't entered this debate at all, and probably aren't going to. They don't care that Christianity is getting less popular. They are about their business of doing their Christianity the way they feel they should and have expressed no opinion either way, publicly. \n \n \nWhereas you always assume it's never religion's fault. There, we've analyzed each other and contributed zero to the debate. We done now?\n\n \n Alright then. I'm more than willing to concede that, with this issue, it's sometimes religion's fault (and have already done so). Are you willing to concede that, with this issue, it's sometimes society's fault?

And before you respond saying \"but I'm just talking about America\" keep in mind that Christianity is much older than this country, and has experienced ebbs and flows of acceptance and rejection throughout it's history (because of BOTH internal issues AND external).

And you know what, at least half the time probably more, the persecutors have been other Christians. Christians have been no slouches at persecuting non-Christians... Jews, Muslims, Pagans, atheists. You name it, it's been persecuted by Christians. \n\n \n None of that justifies irrational prejudices against Christianity. So I'm not sure what your point is.",

So I'm not sure what your point is.\n\n \n How about rational distaste for the hypocrisy of Christian religions? I was simply making the point that while I as an atheist can still find much of value in what is written of Christ's teachings -- the Sermon on the Mount is fairly inspiring, for example, though I don't find the meek particularly blessed as you probably surmise -- I just find Christian religions in practice a bit much to take. Not that this distaste is limited to Christian ones... I can't stand most of what passes for Islam, either.\n \n However, this doesn't translate into bigotry against Christians.

When one religion is the most prominent by a long shot, as you yourself have pointed out, then naturally it's going to be more likely that perpetrators of bad acts associate with it more than other religions or no religion. If a different religion were the most prevalent, it would be THAT religion instead. Or if no religion were prevalent, you would just have bad things perpetrated by non-religious people. Unless you prove causation on the part of the religion, then the fact bad instances happen at the hands of self-professed Christians really doesn't show much in terms of the religion.
