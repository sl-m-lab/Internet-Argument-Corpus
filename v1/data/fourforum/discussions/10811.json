   "Oh, how very sweet, a meeting in pricey Monaco:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/us/15court.html\n \n \nJanuary 15, 2008\n Motion Ties W. Virginia Justice to Coal Executive\n By ADAM LIPTAK\n A justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court and a powerful coal-company executive met in Monte Carlo in the summer of 2006, sharing several meals even as the executive's companies were appealing a $50 million jury verdict against them to the court.\n \n A little more than a year later, the justice, Elliott E. Maynard, voted with the majority in a 3-to-2 decision in favor of the coal companies.\n \n Justice Maynard, who is now West Virginia's chief justice, and Don L. Blankenship, the chief executive of Massey Energy, were \"vacationing together,\" according to a motion seeking Justice Maynard's disqualification, which was filed on Monday. . . .\n",
