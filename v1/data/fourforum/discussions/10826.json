The sheer costs of deportation would be insane, furthermore, I;m pretty sure it's not legal to deport American citizens (aka the kids who were born here) merely because their parents were illegals.\n \n Closing the border to random travel isn't exactly as easy as you make it out to be. Mexico is our #2 or #3 trading partner after Canada and possible China. Randomly shutting down the borders which is no different then stopping travel as the trucks that ship stuff back and forth use the same terminals would hurt the economies of both nations, leading to even MORE illegals coming over. \n \n The key thing that most anti-illegal immigrants fail to realize is that until Mexico can provide better opportunities for its people, they will keep coming here no matter what we do. As Richardson stated, if we build a 12 foot wall, they'll use 13 foot ladders.\n \n Which laws are you discussing about for enforcement?\n \n Plus there hasn't been a conclusive study on whether or not the illegals are better for the economy or worse. But, IMO, they are deflationary factor, reducing labor costs for many industries who pass the savings to consumers. Food, primarily vegetables and fruits for one benefits from low cost labor. I bet you if illegals were all thrown out, stuff would cost a lot more.",

Simply spending more dollars doesn't increase the value of the dollar. Especially when these dollars are created from nothing. A key cause of inflation is adding more money to the money supply without adding corresponding assets and wealth to the country at the same time. And Bush's tax cuts is flawed for several reasons. The rich do not have the same spending multipliers as the poor and the poor/middle class who are going to get essentially nothing out of the next tax cut as they did with the previous ones have a much higher spending multiplier then the rich do, especially in the current situation. The only real benefit the tax cut has is increasing confidence that the economy doesn't suck, which leads to the underlying basis for capitalistic economies: consumer confidence.\n \n \ni said nothing about poor people? i said the government spends money poorly the U.S. relies heavily on contractors for everything most of these contractors have no competition thus there able to charge the U.S. what ever they want until congress catches up if they do.\n\n \n Alright, apparently I misunderstood you.
