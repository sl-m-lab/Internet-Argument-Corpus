   "I wasn't aware of this before, but apparently scientists have been able to sequence the genome of Neanderthal. I was under the impression that only mitochondrial DNA had been obtained. \n \n The findings that have been released so far indicate that we share 99.7% of our genes with Neanderthals. Further, it shows that we interbred to some extent and between 1-4% of our DNA actually originated from this interbreeding. I had always been very skeptical of the interbreeding theory, especially when used to explain the Neanderthal disappearance, but it looks like to some extent it is true. This was shown to have happened after humans left Africa and before Asians and Europeans split. Africans do not show this 1-4% commonality. \n \n Every little aspect of the findings merge perfectly with our speculations and predictions based on evolution. I suppose the reason I hadn't heard about this before is because there really wasn't a big fuss over it. It actually offers very little new information. TOE had already suggested everything to point of acceptance as fact, and this only reaffirms what we already knew. \n \n How does a creationist account for this? How can a creationist continue to deny when every time we look for confirmation, we find it. If a creationist is correct, shouldn't the theory lack this elegance - shouldn't the creationist demand for their own sake that what they hold as true have some of the same elegance when it comes to what we actually see in the world? \n \n \n \n The Neanderthal Genome | The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program\n \n Science/AAAS | Comparative Genomics - The Neandertal Genome",
