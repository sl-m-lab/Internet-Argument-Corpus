   "I happened upon this link while looking for information on carpets. I have read National Geographic articles about the caste system and the existence of slavery in India today, but I was still taken by the stories linked in the following article. If this is an international forum, we should condemn slavery any all countries rather than just bashing the southern United States for past transgressions.\n \n Slavery is still happening today. That's where the real fight should be.\n \n It is important that you read the links within this article to get the full story.\n \n http://www.iabolish.com/today/features/india/carpet.htm\n \n Working Conditions \n \n For child slaves, the injustice of having their childhood and livelihood stolen from them by loom owners is compounded by horrific working conditions. Looms are usually one or two to a small village hut, which is little more than 12 feet by 9 feet with mud walls. The huts are poorly lit, with tiny windows heavily barred against thieves and a thick pane of glass or polythene in the roof as the main light source. Children must work for 12 to 18 hours a day, seven days a week, without breaks. Owners allow them to sleep for very few hours and often chain them to their looms. \n \n In such terrible conditions, children suffer from deteriorated eyesight; lung disease and tuberculosis from inhaling the wool particles; other communicable illnesses such as fever, stomach problems, and typhoid; chronic kidney and liver problems; deformation of the back and limbs; and malnutrition (many children are underweight, of a smaller height in proportion to their age, and have dental problems). \n Click here for a sample story. \n \n Children are also beaten and tortured. Loom masters will often beat them with a bamboo staff or other heavy objects if they work too slowly, make a weaving mistake, or cry for their parents. Some children are branded with hot irons. If they cut their fingers (which happens very often on the sharp cutting tools) the loom masters are known to shave match heads into the cut and set the sulfur on fire so that blood will not stain the carpet. Sometimes slaves are hung upside down from trees and poked with cigarettes. Others are killed for attempting to escape. Click here for the Torture Camp of Mirzapur. \n \n Many of these children have been working since the age of four or five. By the time they reach adulthood, they may be chronically ill or irrevocably deformed. They will simply be replaced and displaced once they have passed the age of productivity and efficiency - i.e., profitability. Most are likely to be dead by the age of 50 even if they are fortunate enough to survive their enslavement.

Because of the way many products are traded in India, it is nearly impossible for companies to know if their products were partially made with child labor.\n \n \nDo you really think that our morals will trumph the right price?\n\n I agree. If companies were to boycott products from India, then they would most likely collapse. Some organizations and companies will stay keep importing from India open, and they'd be able to sell their products for cheaper prices because of that. Most companies won't do anything about it anyways because then they will lose many products and supplies coming from India, which they cannot afford to risk.\n \n It's a valid point, but unless there was a cost-effective way of combatting child labor and slavery in India, then it won't be stopped for a long time.",

I don't even think there is such thing as race, because people have been intermingling for thousands of years....I mean the only people who can truly be classified as belonging to a distinct race would be people who lived isolated for centuries...like the eskimos or remote tribes in South america, Africa, and central asia...the rest of the world, it is hard to say.. My mother is Indian but her grandmother was Iranian .......so what race does that make her ? This is so common....so why even bother...I mean there are different ethnic groups but thats about it....",

   "We as a modern society MUST condemn slavery. But we must be cautious as to the diversity of societies we encounter and India is quite different to the Western society we belong to. I am also making a general statement and this statement is not directed to any media source in particular: sometimes the media can give you only one side of the story.\n \n We must realize that although India's economy is still booming it is still the home for many of the world's poor. Poverty has a devastating effect on children who deserve to get an education and all amenities of life. But because they deserve it does not mean that they get it. We must understand that until families rise above the poverty line, the children of these families may have no choice but to earn a living else they and the whole family will starve. It is the sad reality.\n \n \n \n If companies were to boycott products from India, then they would most likely collapse. Some organizations and companies will stay keep importing from India open, and they'd be able to sell their products for cheaper prices because of that. Most companies won't do anything about it anyways because then they will lose many products and supplies coming from India, which they cannot afford to risk.\n \n\n \n There is wisdom in this statement. In today's world money talks. But I must say that if companies were to decide to boycott companies in India it can cause poverty and desperation among the poor to raise even more. Thus you may be pushing children even more into slavery.\n \n Then there is mention of the Caste system. It has existed for thousands of years and in my view it was not promoted by the original ideals of Hinduism but by dominant figures in society who used it as a means of social control and retaining power. We cannot expect something that has rooted itself in society for thousands of years to be destroyed overnight. With time, the prejudice would die. PS. It is not based on race or skin color.\n \n \n It is because of these inhumane practices that they can compete and undercut the prices of many products from Europe. Millions of Indians have fled from poverty and misery to G. Britain, Canada, and USA etc. Who can blame these pitiful beings for becoming economic refugees?\n \n\n \n Remember that the wealth of many rich nations today was derived from poorer nations India inclusive. Thus developed nations should pay a more proactive role in the rights of people as long as they acknowledge the politics of that society.\n \n \n \nI forgot another disgusting demeaning Indian practice (they have so many....) the \"arranged marriages\": poor little girls are sold to old lecherous men under the guise of 'marriage' this practice borders on pederasty. Poor Indian women, lucky those who escaped to Germany or the US, but still over there this practice continue\n\n I once again point out the possibility of not getting the next side of the story. Many women are very accepting to arranged marriages. They believe that marriage comes first and love comes after. We say so much against arranged marriages but in the Western world where choice of a partner come first marriage problems are in epidemic proportions. What is wrong is that a person is forced into a marriage and where a girl's family has to pay a dowry (I believe that dowries are okay if paid by a man's family but it should only be allowed if the family can afford it and are willing. After all you are now technically taking a man's daughter away from her family. A Hindu belief that once married a girl belongs to her groom's family and must adjust to their ways. This does not mean that she forgets her parents.)\n \n \n \n \nLuckily for you, you don't live in an Indian village but in a modern Western, Christian country\n\n \n I am not supportive of this statement because:\n 1) It implies that the Western society is better than those in the east. You cannot say so without understanding the societies you are critical about. Besides there is also a lot of prejudice and violations of human rights in Western \"modern\" nations.\n 2) It implies that there are no Christians are living in India. This is far from the truth.\n 3) It implies that because the majority of a nation's population is not Christian, that makes the country a violator of civil rights. This is not right. We must remember that there are goodness in other faiths and that Christianity has its own dark spots just as it has good things about it. Remember African slavery and the extinction of the Aztec, Amerindian and Inca civilizations?\n \n I conclude that it is my view that a boycott of Indian products will not solve child labor problems. I suggest that there be negotiations between companies which could perhaps offer incentives to any group that does not promote child labour. The poverty levels over the board must decline.",

   "The current government in India has enacted a new policy of providing addition quotas to the extent of 27% to people who are categorized as \"Backward Castes\". This is in addition to 23% already allocated for people categorized as \"Scheduled Castes and Tribes\" (SC/ST). THIS IS HIGHLY DISCRIMINATORY SYSTEM. The so-called Backward Castes include land owners, bus operators amoung other wealthy people. Many of the SC/STs are truly poor and constitute what are called Dalits (who were have been treated as untouchables). While quotas for Dalits would have a fair reason so-called Backward Caste enjoying these benifits IS A FAILURE OF THE PURPOSE OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. \n \n The backward in the word 'Backward Caste' is not by economic criteria but mere birth into a caste which is lucky to enjoy the benifits.\n \n \n The people of so-called Forward Caste who are condemned out of reservation include poor temple priests amoung others. Their crime is being born as a 'Forward Caste'.\n \n The state of Tamil Nadu has the worst system of discrimination with 69% exclusive reserved and off limit to Forward Caste.\n \n The untouchability and ill-treatment of dalits in southern Tamil Nadu is perperuated by non other than people who are included in Backward castes and enjoy benifits of reservation though many of them are rich. The intelligent amoung these also snatch the remaining of what is available outside of reserved quotas.\n \n \n A Forward Caste today means an disowned by your own state or country. A forward caste Tamil in Tamil Nadu is disowned by Tamil Nadu as higher education is reserved for so-called backwards. Sometimes barely 1 or 2 out of 100 seats gets secured by forwards in state of Tamil Nadu due to 69% seats being reserved.\n \n \n The following links will highlite India's failed system of 'secularity':\n \n http://www.antireservation.org\n http://samathuvam.blogspot.com/2006/06/from-forward-caste-tamil-parent-in.html\n http://samathuvam.blogspot.com/2006/05/success-by-divide-and-rule.html\n http://www.youth4equality.org\n \n Now the disgraceful politicians are trying to enact policy that would make reservation in employment mandatory -- which would affect the working of US multinationals operating in India....\n \n \n PRESIDENT BUSH PLEASE BOYCOTT INDIA\n MICROSOFT DONT INVITE LEADERS FROM TAMIL NADU\n US SHOULD IMPOSE TRADE EMBARGO AGAINST INDIA UNLESS THE RESERVATION POLICY IS COMPLETELY ABOLISHED\n USA SHOULD PRESSURE INDIA TO STOP THE RESERVATION POLICY AND OTHER DISCRIMINATORY POLICIES",
