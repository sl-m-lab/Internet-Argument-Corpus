If I were on Hardball, or in a focus group for Hannity, even without supporting any candidate, I could tell you more than one legislative accomplishment for Mrs. Clinton, for Mr. McCain, for Mr. Obama, and for Congress, in the past 7 years. I also know something about Mrs. Jones' record.\n \n What a sorry state Watson reflects on the disinformative affairs of politics, campaigns, behind the door deals, and voting.\n \n It's a disgrace. And what's even more a disgrace is that Obama fans defend it.\n \n Also. What Chris Matthews couldn't say, as a journalist on television.

While the American economy continues to go to hell. While they're being paid for it, health and retirement benefits included, and for temporary employment. While Americans lose their homes, lose their jobs, their medical care, go bankrupt ...\n \n I hope Texans vote more wisely this time around. I have more confidence in Ohio, though.

How unfortunate for these fine young people, who are really inheriting the mess, that representatives or \"grown-ups\" like Watson don't even care what legislative accomplishments their endorsees have. Just what commercial image inspires, and ... keeps them in office. Playing the game well, but otherwise, doing nothing, when they aren't destroying the country.\n \n So I want a candidate with a time-tested track record. Who's pragmatic and predictable. Has proven accountability. I don't feel like gambling with my country's future.\n \n I have all the inspiration I need from within.\n \n Oh, and I'll hold on to my cynicism, thank you.
