   "Maybe after the black community sees how the democratic party is the true racist political party in the US, they will finally wake up and abandon the party of welfare and support the party that encourages individual prosperity and opportunity for all Americans regardless of the Race, Color or Creed.\n \n Poll: White Democrats may pose problem for Obama Here's an excerpt from the article. \n Poll: White Democrats may pose problem for Obama\n Ron Fournier and Trevor Tompson - Associated Press Writers - 9/20/2008 6:30:00 AM\n WASHINGTON - An AP-Yahoo News poll has found one-third of white Democrats harbor negative views toward blacks - many calling them \"lazy,\" \"violent\" or responsible for their own troubles.\n \n The poll, conducted with Stanford University, suggests that the percentage of voters who may turn away from Obama because of his race could easily be larger than the final difference between the candidates in 2004 - about two and one-half percentage points.\n \n Certainly, Republican John McCain has his own obstacles: He's an ally of an unpopular president and would be the nation's oldest first-term president. But Obama faces this: 40 percent of all white Americans hold at least a partly negative view toward blacks, and that includes many Democrats and independents.\n \n More than a third of all white Democrats and independents - voters Obama can't win the White House without - agreed with at least one negative adjective about blacks, according to the survey, and they are significantly less likely to vote for Obama than those who don't have such views.\n \n Such numbers are a harsh dose of reality in a campaign for the history books. Obama, the first black candidate with a serious shot at the presidency, accepted the Democratic nomination on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech, a seminal moment for a nation that enshrined slavery in its Constitution.\n \n \"There are a lot fewer bigots than there were 50 years ago, but that doesn't mean there's only a few bigots,\" said Stanford political scientist Paul Sniderman who helped analyze the exhaustive survey.\n \n The pollsters set out to determine why Obama is locked in a close race with McCain even as the political landscape seems to favor Democrats. President Bush's unpopularity, the Iraq war and a national sense of economic hard times cut against GOP candidates, as does that fact that Democratic voters outnumber Republicans.\n \n The findings suggest that Obama's problem is close to home - among his fellow Democrats, particularly non-Hispanic white voters. Just seven in 10 people who call themselves Democrats support Obama, compared to the 85 percent of self-identified Republicans who back McCain.\n \n The survey also focused on the racial attitudes of independent voters because they are likely to decide the election.\n \n Lots of Republicans harbor prejudices, too, but the survey found they weren't voting against Obama because of his race. Most Republicans wouldn't vote for any Democrat for president - white, black or brown.\n \n Not all whites are prejudiced. Indeed, more whites say good things about blacks than say bad things, the poll shows. And many whites who see blacks in a negative light are still willing or even eager to vote for Obama.\n \n On the other side of the racial question, the Illinois Democrat is drawing almost unanimous support from blacks, the poll shows, though that probably wouldn't be enough to counter the negative effect of some whites' views.\n \n Race is not the biggest factor driving Democrats and independents away from Obama. Doubts about his competency loom even larger, the poll indicates. More than a quarter of all Democrats expressed doubt that Obama can bring about the change they want, and they are likely to vote against him because of that.\n \n Three in 10 of those Democrats who don't trust Obama's change-making credentials say they plan to vote for McCain.",

We have reversed built in safety valves that protected the system for decades. And they were reversed during the Clinton Administration, and admittedly, some crucial and seriously flawed changes were supported by Republicans too. But Obamas problems run deeper than just the economy. This thread is dealing with the fact that a large percentage of his own party faithful wont trust him for various reasons. Many which are illegitimate in my opinion. I fully agree with rejecting him on the basis of his political philosophy and perceived character flaws is valid. I agree with isly that who a man associates with reflects on his character. And Obama has a laundry list of bad characters in his background. None of whom he rejects until his judgement is questioned, then he drops these so called friends like a bad habit. Which further reflects his consciousness of guilt and lack of loyalty to his friends if he really did believe they were good people for all those years that he used them and allowed them to push him forward.\n \n It also seems strange to me that it's the dems themselves who are attempting to quench this debate about Race. You would think they would want to confront it in order to neutralize its negative effects on the voters. But denial seems to be the their strong suit.  Here's the latest on this racial divide that is so understatedly dominating this election season.\n The discussion on race Obama didn't want\n \n Avi Zenilman, Ben Smith\n Sun Sep 21, 8:59 am ET\n When the Democratic primary descended into a charged debate about black and white and Sen. Barack Obama's racially polarizing pastor last spring, Obama took the stage to address the question of race head-on.\n \"Race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now,\" Obama told those assembled at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center and a nationally televised audience in March.\n His campaign, though, didn't follow his lead.\n Instead, his aides have steered clear of any explicit discussion of racial inequality or of his pioneering campaign as they try to woo swing voters, some of whom may be discomfited by the notion of the first black president.\n \"The best time for a national conversation on race is when he's president,\" Bill Perkins, a New York state senator from Harlem and early Obama supporter, said Saturday, expressing a widely held view among Democrats.\n But the national conversation appears to have arrived. Racial considerations that have long been palpable in southern Ohio and other crucial regions are again in the foreground. A new poll that accompanied a much buzzed-about Associated Press article on Saturday appears to starkly quantify the cost of racism to Obama: 6 percentage points in the polls.\n And Friday's debate will bring the campaign to the Deep South and offer the symbolism of an integrated debate at Ole Miss, the scene of a brutal battle over integration a generation ago. That conversation creates a moment with risks for both candidates - though perhaps greater risks for Obama.\n Many Democrats see the explicit discussion of race and politics as almost unambiguously negative for Obama, a reminder to voters of fraught questions of identity and a distraction from the economic troubles that have dominated the headlines in recent days and could bury Obama's rival, Sen. John McCain, the Republican nominee.\n \n \"From [former Los Angeles mayor] Tom Bradley to [L.A. Mayor] Antonio Villaraigosa to [Massachusetts Gov.] Deval Patrick, non-white candidates have historically been successful reaching broader electorates when they've steered clear of identity politics,\" said Sean Clegg, who until recently was the top political adviser to Villaraigosa.\n \n That's exactly the model followed by Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, who has made a career of electing executives of color. The campaigns he has run for mayor in Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, and for governor of Massachusetts have, like Obama's, relied on combining a group's quiet pride in its favorite son with a determinedly post-racial message of hope and unity.\n Axelrod's outlook was manifest at the Democratic National Convention, where Martin Luther King Jr.'s son addressed the crowd, but Obama's speech accepting his party's nomination, delivered on the 45th anniversary of the famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech, never mentioned the slain civil rights icon by name. \n A Republican strategist, Todd Harris, also suggested the country's economic woes could intensify racial tensions in key states. \"The tragic irony is that the more the economic crisis helps Obama among some voters, it could cost him as much as it helps in some key states because of heightened racism sparked by tough times,\" he said.\n But if Democrats hope to muffle a discussion of race, which polling and reporting have long suggested is a crucial factor in swing states, discussion of it also carries risks for the Republican nominee. McCain has largely steered clear of anything that could be interpreted as race-baiting, and the Republican Party earlier this year warned its officials to stay on message on the sensitive topic. \"They're going to face an avalanche of criticism if they touch the race issue with a 1,000-foot pole,\" said Clegg.\n More subtly, the recent survey findings carry the risk that McCain's candidacy could be cast as relying on racism. His supporters have objected vociferously to lines of analysis like that of a recent Slate article headlined, \"Racism is the only reason McCain might beat [Obama].\"\n Even the suggestion that McCain's campaign is reliant on racism could alienate some voters.\n \"There are a lot of suburban moderates who want to turn the page in the biggest possible way from [President] Bush, and voting for Obama gives them a chance to not only make history, but to prove something to themselves about their own evolved feelings on race,\" said Harris.\n Aides to Obama and McCain declined to discuss the impact of the race conversation Saturday, a mark of its sensitivity. And virtually everyone involved recognizes that the impact of race is difficult to predict.\n \"Some Americans out there will vote for Barack Obama, even though they disagree with him, because they would like to see America move beyond this,\" said veteran Republican strategist Alex Castellanos. \"And there are some Americans who have not moved beyond this.\"\n The campaigns came closest to an open debate over race in late July after Obama predicted the GOP's attack plan would use it. \"What they're going to try to do is make you scared of me,\" he told a crowd in Missouri. \"You know, he doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.\"\n The McCain campaign swiftly rejected any suggestion that it was mining racial resentment and blamed Obama for bringing up the topic.\n \"Barack Obama has played the race card, and he played it from the bottom of the deck,\" campaign manager Rick Davis said in a statement. \"It's divisive, negative, shameful and wrong.\"\n Obama may have stated his feelings, or at least his intentions, most plainly last year in New Hampshire, in the placid waters of the Democratic primary. Then, Time magazine reported, an \"aging hippie\" asked Obama if he would launch another \"national conversation about race.\"\n Obama responded in the negative.\n \"I'm less interested in a conversation about race in the abstract,\" he said. \"All the self-flagellation, it's not useful. African-Americans get all riled up, and whites get defensive.\" \n Jonathan Martin contributed to this story.",

It is simply stupid to elect him just because he is black.\n\n \n I agree, my reason for posting this was to expose how this election is exposing the racism that is inherent within the Democratic Party, and always has been. I remember first hand how it was the dems back in 1960-1964 who fought so hard against the Civil Rights Act. ALGORE SR. specifically was one of the southern leaders who voted against and fought against equality for blacks. \n \n In fact, the Civil Rights Act that Johnson put through that was finally passed by the democratic majority was a weaker watered down version of the bill the Republicans had written which had received so much democratic opposition. I just marvel at how the black community has blindly followed the political party which not only fought the Civil War in order to hold them in bondage as slaves, but also fought every advancement they attempted to make there after. \n \n It has sickened me every four years since Carter how the Black community has swallowed the cheap lip service and unkept promises that kept them forever locked into a manufactured welfare state, as they continued to kneel at the throne of the democrats only to be held back from true and equal opportunities for another 4 years. But they're still buying into the lie, now especially because he's packaged as one of their own.",
