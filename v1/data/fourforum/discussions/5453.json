This is a common trait among all countries. The next generation of muslims in Europe, provided their standard of living has improved compared to their homeland will have their birthrate lowered to closely match that of the population at large. Also as the muslim standard of living in their new country improves the likely hood of them becoming more secular in their beliefs increases dramatically.\n \n As it stands I see many muslims, east Africans, hindu's on a near daily basis. Not one muslim has threatened to cut off my head, not one has called for Shiria law. Most in fact are glad that Shiria law is not in place.

There is no census giving accurate statistics. A report issued by the << Islam in Europe >> committee puts the figure around 20 to 24 million for the whole of Europe including Russia. The number of Muslims in Western Europe could be estimated at around 12 million.\n \n It should be noted that there is some unevenness in distribution. The greatest number are to be found in France (3,500,000 - 4,000, 000), followed by Germany (2,500,000 and then Britain (1,750,000). The Netherlands (500,000) and Belgium (300,000) have less Muslims in absolute numbers, but when the population is taken into account the proportion is quite high. Spain (200,000) and Italy (500,000, though some sources quote twice this number) have a small number in relation to their populations.\n \n (Snip)\n \n When Muslims gain strength, they begin to express demands in the area of ritual. Some wish to observe ritual prayer (sal\u00e2t) during working hours. They can ask for special time arrangements during the month of Ramadan. There are demands for the Muslim feasts of Id al-Fitr and Id al-Adh\u00e2 to be holidays, at least for Muslims. There is concern about obtaining hall\u00e2l meat (which in Sweden has led to serious conflict with the civil authorities, since the Muslim method of slaughter is strictly forbidden as being completely barbarous). \n \n \n http://www.sedos.org/english/fitzgerald.html",

   "That's completely irrelevant though, as Iran is not a developed country. Take Ghana, predominantly Christian, 37% of the population under 14. Turkey, and perhaps Albania, might be sensible comparisons, but both have fertility rates only slightly higher than EU countries. In fact, if we look at most populous Muslim country, Indonesia, we find the fertility rate is still only 2.44. Until you find some concrete figures to back up your assertions, your theories have no basis, apart from anything else most Muslims in Britain are of Indian or Pakistani extraction, and most in Germany are Turks so your \"Eurabia\" comments don't apply in either country.\n \n Halal slaughtering is not barbarous, to suggest that shows a complete failure to understand it. It is generally more human than western production line methods, not least because part of it is that the animal should not know it is to be killed, which is certainly not true of western methods, and death comes almost instantaneously (when done correctly), unlike western methods where animals are stunned, often poorly, and then hung up while still alive to have the blood drained from them.",

If normal people could see the catalog of Islamic customs and what they do to their women and their enemies it would revolt any sane person. Here is but one of their quaint customs.\n \n Islamabad - A bride was gang-raped by her groom's friends on the first night of their marriage with her in-laws' consent in the southern part of Pakistan's Punjab province, a news report said on Monday.\n \n The daily Times said Mujahid Hussain and his family allowed the bride, Kaneez Kubra, to be dishonoured in revenge for her brother's crime of having sexual relations with their daughter.\n \n The bride's father, Ghulam Hussain, said four persons sexually assaulted his daughter in front of his son-in-law in his house in Punjab.\n \n But her ordeal did not end there. Ghulam Hussain said on the following day she was taken to the residence of another friend and assaulted again.\n \n Kubra was married to Mujahid last month on the directives of Panchayat (local jury) after it found her brother guilty of having illicit relations with Mujahid's sister.\n \n In Pakistan's tribal and rural Punjab, women are married without their consent in compensation for the crime committed by their male family members to settle the dispute under \"Swara\" and \"Vani\" custom\n \n http://www.jihadwatch.org/dhimmiwatch/archives/006443.php",

I had occasion to take a trip through Europe by automobile into Switzerland and onto northern Italy. I recognized some of the same roads from the Giro D'talia bike race recently.

Only 8.5 babies were born in Germany last year for every 1,000 residents.\n \n In 1964, 1.36 million babies were born in Germany. In 2005, half as many children were born, at just 680,000-the birth rate hasn't been this low since the end of the Second World War, according to the Federal Statistical Office...\n \n (Snip)\n \n All of Europe is facing the same plummeting birthrate. According to Eurostat, the EU's statistics agency, by 2050 Europe's population will have fallen by around 1.5%, or 7 million people. The birth rate in Britain is at 12 births per 1,000 residents. In France the number is 12.7, in the Netherlands 11.9, and in Ireland 15.2...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2006/mar/06031711.html",

Actually I used the wrong word. It should have been \"hordes.\" The actual definition is this.\n \n An enormous number of persons gathered together: crowd, crush, drove, flock, mass, mob, multitude, press, ruck1, swarm, throng. See big/small/amount, group.\n \n A very large number of things grouped together: army, cloud, crowd, drove, flock, host, legion, mass, mob, multitude, ruck1, score (used in plural), swarm, throng. See big/small/amount, group. \n \n http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery;jsessionid=vedk7esbxm6v?dsid=2222&dekey=Horde&sbid=lc05a&linktext=horde\n \n Therefore the number varies and is in the eye of the beholder. If I go to a movie show and large numbers of people are gathering to buy tickets it would be correct to say that a \"horde\" of people were there. It would also be accurate to say that a million people defined a \"horde.\"\n \n In any event, it is a larger number than a normal gathering of people. Not too long ago I read or saw something that indicated there were a total of 300 million Muslims. That was sometime ago. Perhaps in the early part of the 20th Century. Now it is generally acknowledged to be about 1.2 billion. That's a quadrupling of the Muslim population. Has European native population multiplied four times? I rather doubt it. If the European birth rate is less than the replacement rate (2.1 per couple), and the European social welfare states require immigrants to pay for their European welfare schemes they will necessarily have to get their replacement population from outside their borders. That is more than likely to be from the ME which is overwhelmingly Muslim. \n \n If one graphs the population of Europe and the native European population is going down and the population of immigrant Muslims is going up, then there will be a point somewhere in the future when Muslims will be higher in numbers than native Europeans. That's not rocket science. It's just common sense. Am I wrong?\n \n When did I label ALL Muslims as terrorists? I don't recall ever making that claim. It is true that most terrorism is today is being done by Muslims but that doesn't mean that all terrorism is committed by Muslims. It is important we be accurate when making these assertions.",

We have gathered all the data from authentic sources and calculated the muslim population in each countries and ultimately in the five continents. \n \n We also wanted to show that, by even taking data from General Sources, like CIA Fact Sheet, we can easily establish that fact that total Muslim Population in 2006 is 1.6 billion which is far greater than currently estimated 1.2 or 1.3 billion. Under general source section, we have taken all the datas from popular sources such as CIA Fact Sheet, HOLT,RINEHART & WINSTON etc. \n \n We think that in some countries the total number of Muslims are more in percentage than shown in general sources, like in China and India. For all those few above cases Islamic Sources, news items and thought provoking articles came in great help. Our reasearch shows that the total Muslim Population is 1.79 billion in year 2006. \n \n For any advice please don't hesitate to contact us through email.

   "Behind The Birth Dearth\n \n By Robert J. Samuelson\n Wednesday, May 24, 2006; Page \n \n Russian President Vladimir Putin has inadvertently spotlighted one of today's momentous mysteries: collapsing birthrates in industrialized countries. Putin proposed that Russia pay women to have children to remedy a \"critical\" population outlook. Actually, he might have said \"desperate.\" In 2000 Russia's population totaled almost 147 million; Putin says it's declining by 700,000 a year. With plausible assumptions, the U.S. Census Bureau projects it at 111 million in 2050. The median age (half the population above, half below) would be almost 50, up from 38 now. Could this Russia maintain a strong economy, national optimism or a capable military?\n \n Russia's case, though extreme, isn't isolated. There's no more population \"explosion.\" In wealthier countries, motherhood is going out of style and plunging birthrates portend population loss. This is a hugely significant development, even if we don't fully understand the causes -- 30 years ago experts didn't predict it -- or the consequences. One way or another, the side effects will be massive for economics, politics and people's well-being. Indeed, they may already have started. Is it a coincidence that Germany and Italy, two countries on the edge of population decline, are so troubled?\n \n First, some facts. On average, women must have two children for a society to replace itself. The number of children per woman is called the \"total fertility rate,\" or TFR. Here are the estimated 2005 TFRs for some major countries: Germany, 1.4; Greece, 1.3; Italy, 1.3; Japan, 1.4; Spain, 1.3; and Russia, 1.3. Low fertility rates don't instantly lead to population declines. They can be offset by immigration, longer life expectancies and greater numbers of young mothers. But ultimately low fertility rates suggest falling populations. The table below compares the 2005 populations (in millions) for four countries with the Census Bureau projections for 2050.\n \n \"The forthcoming and dramatic depopulation of Europe and Japan will cause many problems,\" writes Ben Wattenberg in \"Fewer,\" ...\n \n (snip)\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/24/AR2006052400858.html",
