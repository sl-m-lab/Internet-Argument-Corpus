   "School can expel lesbian students, court rules - Los Angeles Times\n \n By Maura Dolan \n January 28, 2009 \n Reporting from San Francisco -- After a Lutheran school expelled two 16-year-old girls for having \"a bond of intimacy\" that was \"characteristic of a lesbian relationship,\" the girls sued, contending the school had violated a state anti-discrimination law.\n \n In response to that suit, an appeals court decided this week that the private religious school was not a business and therefore did not have to comply with a state law that prohibits businesses from discriminating. A lawyer for the girls said Tuesday that he would ask the California Supreme Court to overturn the unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel of the 4th District Court of Appeal.\n The appeals court called its decision \"narrow,\" but lawyers on both sides of the case said it would protect private religious schools across California from such discrimination suits.\n \n Kirk D.

   "This ruling seems to make sense. A religious school should be able to select or expel students based on religious reasons. Most private schools have a code of conduct that students are required to abide by. It would make sense that this would be a violation of that code, especialy if they had \"inappropriate contact\". In most religious schools \"inappropriate contact\" ie sexual contact, is a violation of the code of conduct no matter the orientation.\n As an example, a couple of years ago 4 students were expelled from the Christian school my nieces were going to because it was discovered (they admitted to it) they had been having \"inappropriate contact\". In this case it was heterosexual, but the parents of two of them raised a stink because it wasn't at school. The school told them it made no difference because they were in violation of the code of conduct and it applied 24/7.\n A bit of ramble there but the point is a religious school must be able to expel students for religious reasons.",

Here's the relevant part of the article.\n  \"The school's religious message is inextricably intertwined with its secular functions,\" wrote Justice Betty A. Richli in the appeals court opinion. \"The whole purpose of sending one's child to a religious school is to ensure that he or she learns even secular subjects within a religious framework.\"\n \n The appeals court ruling relied on a 1998 California Supreme Court decision that allowed the Boy Scouts to exclude gays and atheists. The Boy Scouts of America, which had faced similar discrimination charges, did not have to comply with the state's anti-discrimination law because it was a social organization, the state High Court had ruled.\n \n The Riverside County-based school had expelled the two girls, then 16, for having a \"bond of intimacy\" that was \"characteristic of a lesbian relationship.\"\n \n In 2005, a student had reported to a teacher that the girls said they were in love with each other and referred the teacher to the girls' MySpace pages. One girl indicated she was bisexual on her MySpace page, while the other said she was \"not sure\" of her sexual orientation. The school's pastor said that when he confronted the girls over the suspected lesbian behavior, the girls admitted they had hugged and kissed each other and told other students they were lesbians.\n \n The school's pastor suspended the two girls but the directors of the school later expelled them.\n \n The two students, who were only identified in court documents as Jane Doe and Jane Roe, sued the school for violating state anti-discrimination laws.\n \n Court documents show that the school has a policy of refusing admission to homosexual students and its &#8220;Christian Conduct&#8221; rule provided that a student could be expelled for engaging in immoral or scandalous conduct, whether on or off campus, including homosexuality.\n \n The girls were expelled for \"conducting themselves in a manner consistent with being lesbians,\" said John McKay, attorney for California Lutheran, according to the Los Angeles Times. He noted that the girls never disclosed their sexual orientation during the litigation.\n \n McKay said the school's mission statement is to educate students based on Christian principles.\n Calif.

Here's the relevant part of the article. \"The school's religious message is inextricably intertwined with its secular functions,\" wrote Justice Betty A. Richli in the appeals court opinion. \"The whole purpose of sending one's child to a religious school is to ensure that he or she learns even secular subjects within a religious framework.\"\n \n The appeals court ruling relied on a 1998 California Supreme Court decision that allowed the Boy Scouts to exclude gays and atheists. The Boy Scouts of America, which had faced similar discrimination charges, did not have to comply with the state's anti-discrimination law because it was a social organization, the state High Court had ruled.\n \n The Riverside County-based school had expelled the two girls, then 16, for having a \"bond of intimacy\" that was \"characteristic of a lesbian relationship.\"\n \n In 2005, a student had reported to a teacher that the girls said they were in love with each other and referred the teacher to the girls' MySpace pages. One girl indicated she was bisexual on her MySpace page, while the other said she was \"not sure\" of her sexual orientation. The school's pastor said that when he confronted the girls over the suspected lesbian behavior, the girls admitted they had hugged and kissed each other and told other students they were lesbians.\n \n The school's pastor suspended the two girls but the directors of the school later expelled them.\n \n The two students, who were only identified in court documents as Jane Doe and Jane Roe, sued the school for violating state anti-discrimination laws.\n \n Court documents show that the school has a policy of refusing admission to homosexual students and its \"Christian Conduct\" rule provided that a student could be expelled for engaging in immoral or scandalous conduct, whether on or off campus, including homosexuality.\n \n The girls were expelled for \"conducting themselves in a manner consistent with being lesbians,\" said John McKay, attorney for California Lutheran, according to the Los Angeles Times. He noted that the girls never disclosed their sexual orientation during the litigation.\n \n McKay said the school's mission statement is to educate students based on Christian principles.\n Calif. Court: Christian School Can Expel Students Over Lesbian Behavior| Christianpost.com\n\n Archie, again, please listen.\n I AM NOT saying the school can't do this.\n I am not even claiming that it isn't against the school's rules.\n \n What I AM saying is that this case involved NO GAY SEX.\n People who claim that the concern is JUST gay sex are missing a LARGE section of the anti-gay stance which just plain doesn't care about whether \"gay sex\" is present or absent.",

THEY ADMITTED THEY HAD A LESBIAN RELATIONSHIP, WERE IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER AND ALSO HAD KISSED. To think that all they did was kiss, is to deny hormonal reality. But here's a link to a similar story in England where the girl and boy were expelled for breaking the same zero tolerance rule.

I mean that one might have feelings, but until they act on those feelings they don't know if they like it or not. I'm saying that there is a process by which we all fall into the sin of lust and it starts in the mind, and results in acting upon it through the flesh. Once someone submits to that lust, the natural reaction is to accept the result as right. This applies to all lust and isn't just about homosexuality at all. Here's how the bible say's it.\n \n Jam 1:13 Let no one say when he is tempted, \"I am being tempted by God\"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone.\n \n Jam 1:14 But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.\n \n Jam 1:15 Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death. \n \n Jam 1:16 Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.\n This is the process through which sin of the flesh is born. First we think about it, then we act upon those FEELINGS, once we have submitted to lust, we have fallen into it resulting in sin.",

Still if you are a lesbian it probably would be a good thing not to attend a church school that has a policy that lesbianism is a sin\n\n I personally agree.\n Perhaps they listened to people (not naming names) who have tried to proclaim that it is the gay SEX that is the problem...\n \n \n \nDid I mention premarital or adulterous heterosexual sex?\n I think not!\n As usual 'big' boy is putting words in others posts!\n Was better when I was on his ignore list..for about five minutesemoticon_confused\n\n Considering we're talking about SCHOOL age, 18 and younger, I think it's safe to say that any \"heterosexual sex\" is not involving a married couple...\n \n Ergo, if a SCHOOL age person says \"I'm straight\", does that mean they're having sex?",

   "But heterosexual sex IS a sin to the church (anytime before marriage our outside of your spouse in marriage). So if it were a heterosexual couple having sex (notwithstanding the fact that the two girls DID NOT HAVE SEX RENDERING YOUR ARGUMENT MOOT IN THE FIRST PLACE), it would be considered a sin to the church as well. So I really don't get what you are trying to argue here..\n\n \n Heterosexual sex is not a sin according to the church but abuse of it is!!!\n I am not the one arguing you seem to be flailing around trying to argue a point that isn't there( that's nothing new is it?)\n \n \n \n \nWhat are you talking about? Oh, and reported for personal attack and inflammatory language.\n\n \n Maybe thats your problem . Your memory. \n Personal attack..maybe you should get out more!\n The inflammatory language is in your head...somewhere....",

   "Where have I said that was ONLY the extent my religious beliefs are concerned with? I've said repeatedly that it's gay relationships. I never said it was ONLY sex acts. And by the way, my views represent MY beliefs. I never said I speak for all of Christianity on this. Don't be trying to drag me into your spat with Archie here ...\n\n Would you happen to have any bible verse that condemns the actual actions of these two girls?",
