   "AMERICA IS NOT A CHRISTIAN NATION\n \n America is a Christian nation and it was founded on Christian\n principles. This is the Big Lie that is constantly being uttered from\n fundamentalist pulpits. This untruth has been repeated so often, that\n most Christians believe that Jesus Christ was one of the Founding\n Fathers of our great nation.\n \n This was not true when America was founded more than two centuries ago,\n and it's certainly not true today ;America is one of the most\n religiously diverse nations on the planet. It's this ethnic, religious\n and political diversity that's our greatest strength; religious\n polarization can only weaken our union.\n \n If fundamentalists lie about this important matter -- they shouldn't be\n believed when they wax indignant on moral and spiritual matters.\n America is not a Christian nation; abortion is not murder; feminists\n are not witches; abstinence-only sex education does not work; SpongeBob\n and Tinky Winky are not gay (not that there is anything wrong with\n being homosexual); and George W. Bush does not have a direct line to\n the Almighty.\n \n Our nation was founded not on Christian principles but on Enlightenment\n ideals.The intellectual leaders who created America believed that human\n reason could be used to combat ignorance, superstition and tyranny ;\n they had a natural animosity toward organized religion. It's not\n surprising that God is only a footnote in the grand documents that are\n the bedrock of our democracy.\n \n The Constitution makes no mention whatever of any deity. In the\n eighty-five essays that make up The Federalist Papers, the Supreme\n Being is mentioned only twice. In the Declaration of Independence, the\n Big Guy gets two brief nods: A reference to \"the Laws of Nature and\n Nature's God,\" and the often quoted line about men being \"endowed by\n their Creator with certain inalienable rights.\"\n \n If the Founding Fathers were Christians and they wanted to establish a\n Christian nation, then why didn't they mention Jesus Christ even once\n in a document that they knew would be the cornerstone and foundation of\n the emerging democracy? That's like Marx writing the \"Communist\n Manifesto\" without mentioning \"socialism\".\n \n The distinguished leaders of the American revolution were not devout\n individuals, and they fought energetically to erect, in Thomas\n Jefferson's immortal words, \"a wall of separation between church and\n state.\"\n \n If we define a Christian as a believer in the divinity of Jesus Christ,\n then most of the leading lights of the American Revolution were not\n Christians at all. Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Tom Paine\n were deists -- they believed in one Supreme Being but rejected\n revelation and all the supernatural elements of evangelical\n Christianity. John Adams was a professed liberal Unitarian; in his\n published writings he seemed more deist than Christian. In other words\n if these gentlemen were alive today, they would be more at home in a\n liberal Presbyterian congregation than at Jerry Falwell's Thomas Road\n Baptist Church.\n \n It's latter-day interlopers who have breached the wall of separation\n between church and state. In God We Trust\" did not appear on our\n coinage until the Civil War, and \"under God\" was introduced into the\n Pledge of Allegiance during the McCarthy hysteria in 1954.\n \n If we really want to abide by the spirit of the Constitution and The\n Declaration of Independence -- we will put an end to all this\n foolishness about bringing back God into our public schools. Those who\n imagine a Christian America would be paradise, would be well advised to\n consider the theocracies of Iran, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan under\n the Taliban.\n \n Ironically, as our nation becomes less Christian and more religiously\n diverse, evangelicals redouble their efforts to make America more\n Christian.\n \n Everyone who loves democracy and freedom must fight the efforts of\n fundamentalists to tear down the wall of separation between church and\n state. Jesus Christ may reign supreme in evangelical churches, but He\n should be kicked to the curb if He tries to scale the wall of\n separation and enter the political arena.\n \n America is not a Christian nation. America is not a Christian nation.\n America is not a Christian nation. God, it feels good telling the\n truth. I may be a \"little voice crying in the wilderness\", but with the\n truth on my side, I will defeat a lie -- no matter how big.\n \n Robert Paul Reyes",

Considering some of the over-the-top things that have been said here in these forums lately against religion and Christianity in particular, I thought Paglia's centered remarks were very refreshing. It's nice to be reminded in in practice that probably most atheists and agnostics out there aren't so hostile toward religion as well as aversive to the idea of Christianity playing a role in the founding of the U.S. republic as some here are.\n\n \n Well, it comes as no surprise you found this typical little diatribe by a narcissistic, pseudo-intellectual dilettante appealing! Camille Paglia loves to hear herself talk, and the only way she can do that is by being obtusely outrageous, assuming the pose of some sort of maverick iconoclast with all the intellectual heft of Ann Coulter, and none of the charm.Like her soul-sister Ann, she's popular among a certain crowd because she makes a living from being obnoxiously contradictory.\n \n Let' s dissect some of the imbecilities, shall we?\n \"...the founders of the U.S. social experiment were Christians (even if many were intellectual deists)...\"\n Some were pretty scathing of Christian institionalised religion. They certainly wouldn't be recognised as Christians had they not had the forethought to become revered as the founders. They would have been reviled, instead. Case in point: Thomas Paine. Author of Common Sense (1776), The Rights of Man (1792), The Age of Reason (1794), Essays on Religion (1797), he repudiated and mocked some of the core theological tenets of Christianity, and espoused a deism that was rejected by many of his contemporaries (and later) as no better than atheism.\n \"In my lecture on religion and the arts in America earlier this year at Colorado College, I argued that secular humanism has failed, that the avant-garde is dead, and that liberals must start acknowledging the impoverished culture that my 1960s generation has left to the young. Atheism alone is a rotting corpse. I substitute art and nature for God -- the grandeur of man and the vast mystery of the universe.\"\n With all due respect to Ms. Paglia, Secular Humanism hasn't even been tried. The avant-garde went the way of all fads, as will Ms. Paglia herself, bless her, and liberals will continue to ignore her fatuity. They weren't alone responsible for the culture of the 60s, which wasn't all bad -- it gave us civil rights and respect for our fellow human, until the Nixonian 70s destroyed all the good in it, and exacerbated the bad -- but since she makes her living attacking this caricature of \"liberal\", she has to say foolish things about \"liberals\" in order to get speaking invitations by conservatives, who prefer caricature over reality.\n \n As for atheism alone being a \"rotting corpse\", what meaningless verbiage is this? Atheism alone is just a disbelief in a deity. It isn't a philosophy in itself, just a metaphysical view. Many philosophies incorporate atheism, but few require it. Those same philosophies have often incorporated religious beliefs as well, for example in the theistic Marxist liberation theology of South and Central America -- another child of the 60s. \n \n Further, since when does atheism exclude art and nature appreciation? Atheists can't admire and explore \"the mystery of the universe\"? Since when? Many atheists have and do. And what is this \"grandeur of man [sic]\" this woman speaks of? Of all the grandstanding, mediocre pomposities, this ranks pretty high.\n \"Without spirituality in some form, people will anesthetize themselves with drink or drugs -- including the tranquilizers that seem near universal among the status-addled professional class of the Northeastern elite.\"\n That's rich. Considering Ms. Paglia is one of this elite, and feeds well off it, I'd say this takes hypocrisy to insouciant heights! She's a social parasite, not a thoughtful critic. Ms. Paglia, the reigning maven of prostitution, lecturing us on spirituality? Ha! \n \"In this climate, it is selfish and shortsighted for liberals to automatically define religion as a social problem that needs suppression or eradication.\"\n What a grand generalisation! ALL \"liberals\" apparently think this. There isn't a single religious \"liberal\" in the US!! Never mind that most people who self-identify as \"liberal\" are also deeply religious. Facts should never be allowed to stand in the way of the empty rhetoric so dear to the hearts (if they had any) of the right.\n \"Europe, which has settled into a comfortable secularism, is no model for the future. The great era of European achievement in arts and letters seems to be over. There are local luminaries but no towering figures any longer of the stature of James Joyce, Pablo Picasso, Marcel Proust, Thomas Mann or Ingmar Bergman.\"\n Goodness me! She swotted up the names of some European worthies! This is a predictably typical lament, made in every generation at least since the beginning of writing. \"There were giants in the Golden Age of long ago, but none tread this earth today! Woe is us, and it's all the fault of them pesky, evil librulls!!!\" emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Europe is doing ok, thank you, for all the hysteria of Ms. Paglia. And no American should be denigrating the contributions of other nations to culture -- at least not after saying what Ms. Paglia had to say about American culture, to which she has contributed almost as much as any American. But then, she's just parrotting the popular right-wing mantra, as they disclaim all responsibility for everything bad: \"It's all the fault of them librulls!\"\n \n Hogwash. But understandably, it's appealing hogwash for them as likes it, and can't see through it despite its obvious transparency.",
