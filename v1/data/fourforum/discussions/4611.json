The less gay rights activists push for complete equality, the less they are going to get. People do justify banning civil unions as well as marriage because \"gays deserve it for pushing so hard toward marriage\". Of course, that logic is horrible, for people do not deserve to be punished because they've asked for equal rights. But regardless, if gay rights activists asked for only civil unions, then people would feel just as obligated to suggest a compromise between civil unions and no unions, then they would feel obligated in banning that too, because gay people shouldn't have been pushing for civil unions.\n \n If we do not push for complete equality, there will never be complete equality, and no matter how many states decide to ban it, things will never change if this fight does not happen.",

In denying the appeal of a same-sex couple that had tried unsuccessfully to marry, a Georgia court wrote that such unions are \"not only unnatural, but...always productive of deplorable results,\" such as increased effeminate behavior in the population. \"They are productive of evil and evil only, without any corresponding good...[in accordance with] the God of nature.\"\n \n No. 9. A gay marriage ban is not discriminatory,\" reasoned a Republican Congressman from Illinois, because it \"applies equally to men and women.\"\n \n No. 10. Attorneys for the State of Tennessee argued that such unions should be illegal because they are \"distasteful to our people and unfit to produce the human race....\" The state supreme court agreed, declaring gay marriages would be \"a calamity full of saddest and gloomiest portent to the generations that are to come after us.\"\n \n No. 11. Lawyers for California insisted that a ban of same-sex marriage is necessary to prevent \"traditional marriage from being contaminated by the recognition of relationships that are physically and mentally inferior...[and entered into by] the dregs of society.\n \n No. 12. \"The law concerning marriages is to be construed and understood in relation to those persons only to whom that law relates,\" thundered a Virginia judge in response to a challenge to the state's non-recognition of same-sex unions. \"And not,\" he continued, \"to a class of persons clearly not within the idea of the legislature when contemplating the subject of marriage.\"\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n To sum up:  Legal recognition of such marriages would offend tradition, God, the sensibilities of the majority and the natural order while threatening the conventional marriage, children and the future of our civilization.\n \n The quotes are culled from a Boston University Law Review article and a brief filed with the U.S. Supreme Court, although I did take the minor liberty of changing the subject of the strangled rage, fear and righteous indignation.\n \n Everywhere I quoted the speakers' references to same-sex marriage, homosexuality and heterosexuality, they were actually referring to interracial marriage and their views of black people, white people and the proper interaction thereof. And, yes, that includes statement No. 6, which in its original form articulated the old white supremacist belief that offspring of whites and blacks were--like mules that resulted when horses mated with donkeys--sterile.\n \n The quotes date from 1823 to 1964 and, while ridiculous to us in 1996, they had sufficient appeal and staying power that 15 states still criminalized black-white marriage until the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overturned those laws in the appropriately named 1967 case Loving vs. Virginia.\n \n Those whose unaltered words today resemble statements 1 through 12 above, take note.

   "Why am I not suprised to see that it was Eric Zorn who wrote that? :)\n A more recent article by Zorn (who--for the uninformed--is a straight African-American father): \nIn July, a Gallup Organization poll asking how people felt about a broadening of our traditional notions of marriage showed only 36 percent approval for the idea.\n \n This is exactly the same percentage of respondents who, in February, told Gallup that we shouldn't expand the legal definition of marriage.\n \n The difference is that the February poll was taken this year and asked respondents about homosexual couples. The July poll was taken in July 1978 and asked respondents about mixed-race couples.\n \n In February 1965, more than two years before the U.S. Supreme Court struck down remaining state laws prohibiting whites from marrying blacks, Gallup found that 48 percent of respondents in a national poll still approved of such prohibitions.\n \n Elsewhere in the blinkered past, 51 percent of Americans in a February 1959 Gallup poll said they favored amending the Constitution so that each state could \"decide for itself what it wants to do about integration of white and [black] students in the schools.\"\n \n In June 1963, fully 42 percent of Americans told Gallup they opposed laws to give blacks \"the right to be served in public places such as hotels, restaurants [and] theaters.\"\n \n We've come a long way.\n \n In 1958, Gallup found 94 percent of Americans disapproved of interracial marriage. A similar poll taken earlier this year found only 19 percent disapproved.\n \n From 1973 to 1996, National Opinion Research Center data show the percentage of Americans who said they felt homeowners should be allowed to refuse to sell to people based on race dropped from 63 to 29.\n \n Those numbers are still too high, but they've dwindled into the disreputable margins, as discriminatory thoughts and practices tend to do.\n \n And though the line on the graph of progress in civil rights hasn't been exactly smooth, the trend in the last half-century illustrates Martin Luther King's saying, \"The arc of history is long, but it bends toward justice.\"\n \n Historical opinion polls offer a reality check to anyone who thinks the gay-rights movement suffered a permanent setback when 11 out of 11 states approved referendums calling for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.\n \n Though the African-American struggle for acceptance and equality has been different in many ways from the gay struggle, the long-term polling trends tell a similar story.\n \n A review of public opinion on gay rights published earlier this year by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, noted a \"substantial liberalization in attitudes toward homosexuality\" since the mid-1970s.\n \n The 56-page report (see my Tribune Web log) shows how agreement with the following statements has changed over time: \n \n Gay sex is always wrong: 1973, 70 percent; 2002, 53 percent. \n \n Homosexuality is an acceptable lifestyle: 1982, 34 percent; 2003, 46 percent. \n \n I'm not uncomfortable around gays: 1983, 40 percent; 2000, 60 percent. \n \n Gays should be allowed to teach in elementary schools: 1977, 27 percent; 2004, 61 percent. \n \n I could support a gay person for president: 1978, 26 percent; 1999, 59 percent. \n \n People are born homosexual: 1977, 12 percent; 2003, 38 percent. \n \n I have a friend or close acquaintance who is gay: 1985, 22 percent; 2000, 56 percent. \n \n Almost the only area in which you don't see this pattern of liberalization is in attitudes about gay marriage. Approval was only at 12 percent in 1988 when the first known poll was taken, according to the AEI report, but that needle has been stuck for more than a decade at roughly a third of the population, depending on exactly how the pollsters word their questions.\n \n Yet support for marriage-like civil unions, of the sort endorsed in a pre-election TV interview by President Bush, hovers around 50 percent--though again it seems to depend on the phrasing of the questions.\n \n This particular arc in history is a rainbow.\n \n The elections of 2004 have hidden it behind a cloud, but it remains bent toward justice.\n\n \n http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-0411090324nov09,0,548344.column",

   "http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=same-sex%20marriage%20and%20the%20law \nSame-sex marriage is a civil rights issue, identical to the issue of interracial marriages, which was decided in the United States in the case of Loving v. Virginia, 388 US 1 (1967). As such it cannot be left up to state legislatures. The legislative branch is the thrall of the majority. History has shown that unlimited democracy is the root of much injustice and tryanny. To control the majority, we have a Constitution and laws, and an \"activist\" judiciary to declare when the legislature has gone too far.\n \n In 1967, it was not difficult to get a majority of people --72% in a Southern state like Virginia-- to vote to make marriages between a \"white\" person and a \"colored\" person a felony. That's right, a felony. The argument advanced by the trial judge in that case, when he sentenced Mr. Loving and his black wife to a year in prison, was that \"Almighty God\" had separated the races by placing them on different continents, and did not intend for them to mix...\n \n Miscegenation--interracial marriage--was a major theme in the Judeo-Christian Bible, and not just in a few obscure passages in letters by Paul. The Bible prohibits interracial marriages many times, and both literally and figuratively. See Deuteronomy 7:3; Numbers 25:6-8; 1 Kings 11:2; Ezra 9:2; Nehemiah 13:25-27. Symbolically, marriage between Jews and non-Jews represents religious syncretism: the union of Jewish and Gentile religious practices. Clearly this was not the case in the American South: not only had black people been Christianized, but they had been inculcated in the very same sects of Protestantism to which their former owners nominally adhered. Nonetheless, the habit of identifying with the \"Chosen People\" was too strong to be overcome by such a subtle factual distinction. \n",

The event, meant to honor King and Minnesota civil rights icons, was sponsored by conservative Sen. Michele Bachmann, R-Stillwater. Battle is an African American who grew up in segregated Mississippi. He also led a committee that chose the street that runs in front of the Capitol to be renamed after King. Battle is convinced that if Martin Luther King were alive today, he would support a ban on gay marriage.\n \n \"Because he was 100 percent family. He knew that family was the thing that makes this country a great country,\" says Battle. \"And then because of slavery, we as black folks were separated so much on purpose to keep us from growing into a family.\" Battle also says King's theology would have prevented him from endorsing gay marriage. He says King believed in a Bible that stated God's opposition to homosexuality, and that defined marriage as between one man and one woman.

   "If the concept of 'harm' is to decide whether or not gay people should be allowed to redefine the institution of marriage, then gay rights groups have little to stand on. The most that can be said is that one group has less benefits than the other. (Of course that requires the premise that both are legitimate groups when it comes to marriage.) Even if we do take the premise that both groups qualify as legitimate criteria for marriage, we can only go so far as to say that one of those groups is getting less benefits than the other--hardly as example of \"harm.\" Civil rights themselves were not decided upon by the concept of harm, but rather equality. \"Harm\" is an issue that comes into play with criminal issues. To accuse the govt. of harming someone requires evidence and proof. Ultimately it was not the issue of 'harm' that brought about civil rights for blacks. It was rather that enough people in the country realized it was the right thing to do. Amendments don't pass in a vacuum or by the judiciary, and an amendment was what guaranteed equality to black people. Regardless of what one's view is of what the founding fathers of our country intended, we can assume based on history that simply claiming \"I'm being harmed\" is not going to be enough to change the law of the land to allow same-sex marriage. Not only must that harm be proven with evidence, true legal acceptance can only happen with enough people changing their minds about it. Further complicating the issue is that for many Americans, the concept of \"legal marriage\" is tied to marriage itself to the point changing the legal criteria too much requires changing the definition of the institution of marriage. Gay rights people, you have quite a task ahead, convincing America to redefine the institution of marriage.",

   "Remember, Jyoshu, that it does not matter whether or not gay people are being harmed. It is enough to show that legalizing same-sex marriage is not harmful to indicate that it should be allowed. In a free society, the government does not deny rights or benefits to its people without a good reason; it does not deny those rights and benefits unless they are harmful. It is not the place of government to interfere in the lives of its people, to promote one lifestyle over another. The mere fact that same-sex marriage is not harmful is enough to make it morally evil to deny it.\n \n That being said, it is even more justification to legalize same-sex marriage in that it is helpful. Same-sex couples and their children would be helped dramatically. The spread of STD's would be curbed. Equality and freedom would be promoted. So not only is same-sex marriage not harmful, it is beneficial.\n \n Furthermore, same-sex couples can be considered harmed without same-sex marriage. This is because benefiting one group of people is no different from punishing another. Each benefit of opposite-sex marriage is paid for through tax money; it isn't just the tax money of opposite-sex couples who pay for this, it is the tax money of same-sex couples too. We are forcing same-sex couples to pay for the marriages of opposite-sex couples, and no one is paying for theirs. This is indeed a harm. Discouraging freedom and denying equality are also harms in themselves.\n \n Beyond this, denying same-sex marriage provides no benefits.\n \n So overall, I state that denying same-sex marriage brings benefits, but it brings harm to same-sex couples, freedom, and equality. Allowing same-sex marriage benefits same-sex couples and harms no one. This is why the choice on this issue is so overwhelmingly clear in my mind.\n \n Regarding slavery, people did eventually realize it is the right thing to do, but why did they realize it? Was it because the Bible stated that slavery is wrong? Certainly the Bible does not state that. It was because they realized that slavery is harmful to the slaves.",

The mere fact that same-sex marriage is not harmful is enough to make it morally evil to deny it.\n Very well stated. There has to be a reason for any person or group of people to be denied access to a civil institution already available to others, and that reason has to be based on the demonstrable net harm or benefit of them being given that access, not on someone's arbitrary definition of \"morality,\" no matter how many people share that definition. Many more people felt interracial marriage was \"immoral\" at the time of Loving v. Virginia  than feel same-sex marriage to be so today, but their majority opinion was irrelevant, as the SCOTUS well knew: what did matter was whether there was any rational reason  for barring such marriages, based on the harmful or beneficial effects that could be logically demonstrated would ensue.\n \n Two quotes by Jefferson are particularly apt here: \nOur civil rights have no dependence upon our religious opinions more than our opinions in physics or geometry. \n and \nThe legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others.

It is enough to show that legalizing same-sex marriage is not harmful to indicate that it should be allowed. \n\n \n Then why are you arguing for same-sex marriage on the basis of being \"harmed\" by the govt.?\n \n \nIn a free society, the government does not deny rights or benefits to its people without a good reason; \n \n it does not deny those rights and benefits unless they are harmful\n\n \n Ah, there's the catch now, isn't it: \"a good reason.\" And I suspect you will never be convinced there is any good reason to deny it, because you've made up your mind beforehand.\n \n We've been over this before, but the govt. denies benefits to people all the time regardless of whether or not those who receive them or don't receive them are harmful. Affirmative action, disability, medicare, and social security are ALL examples of this. For me anyway, this is not an issue of whether you should have couples' benefits--if you need them then you should have them. But not by recognizing gay unions as marriage, any more than recognizing a 25 year old as criteria to receive social security, or a healthy non-disabled person criteria for disability. Can you say that 25 year-olds are harmful to society? No, so why deny them money they might need (in some cases they might need it MORE than senior citizens!) You see, the govt. rarely EVER uses the issue of harm to determine this sort of thing. It's easy to throw out the word 'harm' as if our constitution always requires that to be the determining factor, but it's just not the case. Sure, if you need couples' benefits, let's find a way to make that happen. But let's not redefine marriage to do it.\n \n \nRegarding slavery, people did eventually realize it is the right thing to do, but why did they realize it? Was it because the Bible stated that slavery is wrong? Certainly the Bible does not state that. It was because they realized that slavery is harmful to the slaves.\n\n \n And if the people decide it's wrong to not redefine the institution of marriage, so be it. (I won't agree with them, but as an American I'd still be here and pay my taxes.) But at least I'd know that the people did indeed do this, as they did in cases of civil rights.",

   "Then why are you arguing for same-sex marriage on the basis of being \"harmed\" by the govt.?\n\n \n I argue both because both are valid points that add to my cause. Not everyone agrees that we should allow anything that isn't harmful; not everyone believes in freedom.\n \n \nAh, there's the catch now, isn't it: \"a good reason.\" And I suspect you will never be convinced there is any good reason to deny it, because you've made up your mind beforehand.\n\n \n A good reason is one that is logically sound. Even your later arguments about social security say, \"Well, we do it with social security, so why can't we do it with same-sex marriage\". That is a logical fallacy for there is no reason to believe that we distribute social security equally, but more importantly, we obviously do it with social security for a reason, and that reason simply does not apply to same-sex marriage. I've made up my mind because I've heard the arguments.\n \n \nWe've been over this before, but the govt. denies benefits to people all the time regardless of whether or not those who receive them or don't receive them are harmful. Affirmative action, disability, medicare, and social security are ALL examples of this.\n\n \n You're right. Every time I post this, I agree that the government is denying people benefits, but I never said it was wrong to deny people benefits in every case; I said it is wrong to deny people benefits if no harm comes from doing so. So let us examine why it is wrong for the government to allow everyone to everyone to get the benefits you mentioned. The government believes that blacks, the eldery, the disabled, and the poor all experience additional suffering and hardship in life. They are at a lower ability to succeed, and because of this, they need additional help. To compensate the hardships of these people, the government takes benefits from everyone else and gives them to the people who really need them. The suffering of people in this case is a harm; it's the greatest harm. The ideas of freedom and equality exist for the sole purpose of promoting the happiness of the people.\n \n So what would happen if we gave everyone those rights? If we gave everyone medicare, taxes would increase, and everyone would have to pay additional money to fund medicare. This would negate the benefit intended to offset the hardships of being poor. What if we allowed everyone to park in the handicap spot? Again, anyone could park anywhere, and we would have negated the benefit intended to help handicap people. When we implement a benefit for some people, we do so to offset the hardship experienced by those people. Allowing more people to have those benefits recreates the harm that they were originally intented to protect against.\n \n But opposite-sex couples do not experience any harm or hardship or suffering greater than same-sex couples. Because of this, the claim cannot be made that these benefits are intended to offset the hardship of opposite-sex couples. They experience no additional hardship. Denying same-sex marriage perpetuates a system in which two groups of equal need recieve different benefits for the sole purpose of imposing the majority's religious values upon the minority. Both groups deserve exactly the same benefits.\n \n \nFor me anyway, this is not an issue of whether you should have couples' benefits--if you need them then you should have them.\n\n \n See, I think you understand the point I've made above to some extent because you are agreeing that same-sex couples deserve the same benefits as opposite-sex couples. I think you understand that two groups with the same needs should have the same benefits to compensate those needs or we are not equal.\n \n \nBut not by recognizing gay unions as marriage, any more than recognizing a 25 year old as criteria to receive social security, or a healthy non-disabled person criteria for disability. Can you say that 25 year-olds are harmful to society? No, so why deny them money they might need (in some cases they might need it MORE than senior citizens!) You see, the govt. rarely EVER uses the issue of harm to determine this sort of thing. It's easy to throw out the word 'harm' as if our constitution always requires that to be the determining factor, but it's just not the case. Sure, if you need couples' benefits, let's find a way to make that happen. But let's not redefine marriage to do it.\n\n \n I would love to get 25 year olds benefits, but they simply don't have the same hardships and the same needs of a different group, so denying them benefits does not prevent a harm. In the case of marriage, both groups have precisely the same needs. I would say that even though Congress never specifically states the reason they pass a bill in terms of harms and benefits, the reason for most of our laws cannot be understood except in light of harms and benefits. And those laws which are morally good are those which exist to discourage harm or increase benefits.\n \n \nAnd if the people decide it's wrong to not redefine the institution of marriage, so be it. (I won't agree with them, but as an American I'd still be here and pay my taxes.) But at least I'd know that the people did indeed do this, as they did in cases of civil rights.\n\n \n But the people didn't usually just decide to grant equal civil rights in the past, in most cases. They did most directly in the case of women's sufferage. This is no surprise; women comprise half of our population. But smaller groups have less influence, and only the minority supported freeing the slaves when they were emancipated. Lincoln hadn't even had intentions of doing so except that he had to as part of the war effort. Segregation was struck down by the Supreme Court. In these fundamental cases, the people never decided to allow freedom or equality, they only learned it many years after it was forced upon them, and some are still learning it today.",

The 200,000 people who took part in the March have Rustin to thank for the orderly progress on that historic day's events. His passion for detail was of great value to the success of the event. It was at Rustin's urging that Randolph called for the march which culminated in the historic \"I Have a Dream\" speech by Dr. King. Randolph referred to Rustin as \"Mr. March\".\nStrom Thurmond took to the floor of the United States Senate in July of 1963, and denounced the upcoming March on Washington by calling attention to Bayard Rustin's homosexuality. Thurmond's plan to ruin the event failed miserably when Martin Luther King, Jr. stood in defense of Rustin .
