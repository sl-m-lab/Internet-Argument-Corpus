Nevertheless, I never said they were treated equally. I merely meant to point out that the simple fact that they were not treated equally does not prove that they didn't deserve to be treated equally.\n \n Let me put it this way: say someone named Bob owns a restaurant. When you walked into Bob's restaurant one day, Bob took out his big shotgun and exclaimed \"We don't accept your kind in here.\" This would be a case of Bob not treating you as equal.\n \n Then on another day you relate this story to your friend, Suzy. Suzy can't believe that Bob would do such a thing because Suzy sees you and Bob as equals. So now there is a dilemma. You are treated as both equal to and not equal to Bob at the exact same time.
