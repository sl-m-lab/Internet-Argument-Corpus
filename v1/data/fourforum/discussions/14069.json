   "\n GOP challenges send health bill back to House\n .....\n For much of Wednesday and into Thursday morning, Senate Republicans offered dozens of amendments to the bill President Obama signed into law Tuesday . Their goal was to force the legislation that will launch an overhaul of the nation's health-care system. back to the House for another vote. But when the Senate began voting shortly after 5 p.m., all 29 amendments were easily rejected. \n \n .........\n The defeated amendments would have altered central elements of the health-care law. One would have rescinded more than $500 billion in Medicare cuts, a key source of funding to make health insurance affordable to an estimated 32 million additional people over the next decade. \n \n Another proposal would have eliminated an array of smaller provisions that benefit particular states or regions, provisions Republicans derided as \"sweetheart deals\" whose only purpose was to win the support of specific Democratic lawmakers. \n \n Other amendments would have stripped the bill of tax increases that will affect individuals who make less than $200,000 a year -- upholding Obama's campaign pledge not to raise taxes on the middle class, Republicans said -- and erased a requirement that employers offer affordable coverage to their workers or face penalties. \n \n Under another proposal, offered by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), Obama and members of Congress would have been required to buy insurance through state-run exchanges that were created by the legislation and that will start in 2014. The amendment failed, but the White House announced that Obama would use the exchanges anyway, apparently assuming he will win reelection in 2012. That prompted Grassley to quip: \"This is a little presumptuous.\" \n washingtonpost.com \n\n \n Even though all of the amendments were defeated, the Republicans now have Democrats on record for 1) voting FOR Medicare cuts,2) for sweetheart deals, 3)for middle class tax increases 4) against them having to live with their newly-created plan.\n \n IMO, these will be used as nails to drive into the coffins of Democrats in swing states in November. \n Nice play, RNC. emoticon_xgood",
