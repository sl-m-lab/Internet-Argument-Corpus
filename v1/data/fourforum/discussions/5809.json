Canadians never do want debates on social issues re-started, once they have been decided. There is absolutely nothing to indicate Canadians want another debate or vote on this issue. It is settled.\n\n \n \nHarper and the Conservatives are falling extremely low in the opinion polls,\n \n \n Jake, Martin just barely held off the Conservatives in that last vote a couple of weeks ago and you know it..........",

   "Jake, Martin just barely held off the Conservatives in that last vote a couple of weeks ago and you know it..........\n\n \n They were holding off the Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois, who both wanted to cause an election. Together there was a possibility they had the numbers to do so. We can be sure the Bloc Quebecois wanted to defeat the Liberals for reasons other than same-sex marriage, as the overwhelming majority of BQ voted in favour of same-sex marriage. I also know that the Conservatives held back a few members in future confidence votes, which would have forced an election. The Conservatives lost enthusiasm for an election, because they have fallen so low in public opinion. Conservatives lost support, because Harper looked angry and power-hungry, and was trying to force an election that Canadians DID NOT want, for his own gain. Now Harper is trying to change his image with a make-over, and he is not convincing anyone.\n \n There are no more confidence votes coming up, because the budget has been passed. There are no more opportunities to defeat the government. Parliament is gone for the summer. There will be no more such votes in the fall. PM Martin has promised to call an election in late fall or winter.",

   "Man soddom and gammorah, thats all it is. Tsk Tsk Tsk. At least I know Christ is true and will return and I will be in paradise with HIM.\n\n \n Sweet, spiritually abused boy...here read this: Genesis 18 - 19 \n \n \nThe Church has traditionally accepted the third explanation. In fact, the term sodomy which means anal intercourse is derived from the name of the city, Sodom. But the first explanation is clearly the correct one. As recorded in Matthew 10:14-15 and Luke 10:7-16, Jesus implied that the sin of the people of Sodom was to be inhospitable to strangers. In Ezekeiel 16:48-50, God states clearly that he destroyed Sodom's sins because of their pride, their excess of food while the poor and needy suffered, and worshiped many idols; sexual activity is not even mentioned. Jude disagreed with God; he wrote that Sodom's sins were sexual in nature. Various biblical translations describe the sin as fornication, going after strange flesh, sexual immorality, perverted sensuality, homosexuality, lust of every kind, immoral acts and unnatural lust; you can take your pick.\n We are faced with the inescapable and rather amusing conclusion that the condemned activities in Sodom had nothing to do with sodomy.\n",

   "One of the most raucous debates in Canadian history resulted in a vote that made Canada the fourth country to sanction same-sex marriage on Tuesday.\n \n The Senate erupted in a loud cheer as it adopted the Liberal government's Bill C-38, which will give gay and lesbian couples the right to marry in courthouses and city halls across the country.\n \n The 47-21 vote came after years of court battles and debate that divided families, religious groups and even political allies.\n \n The final word in the debate came from a Liberal senator who read to the hushed chamber an e-mail from a Yukon constituent.\n \n \"You have no idea what a difference it makes to the human spirit to know that you are treated equally under the law,\" said Ione Christensen, the 71-year-old senator from Whitehorse.\n \n With that, members of the upper chamber were called in for a three-minute vote that came just after 11 p.m. and after three years of political and legal battles.\n \n The bill will become law when it receives royal assent in a ceremony as early as Wednesday.\n \n \"Same-sex, same rights,\" Liberal Senator Jim Munson quipped.\n \n As the debate dragged on Tuesday, the Liberals threatened to invoke closure and call a snap vote on C-38. But the debate ran its course later in the night and members stood for a vote.\n \n The country had been almost evenly split on the legislation, which found its greatest support among younger Canadians and small-l liberal voters.\n \n But even within political clans the issue created irreconcilable fissures. \n \n One Liberal MP -- Pat O'Brien -- quit his party caucus out of frustration with the bill and Joe Comuzzi resigned from the federal cabinet.\n \n Conservative Leader Stephen Harper has said he will bring back the debate if he's elected prime minister.\n \n One Conservative said voters will have the final say over Ottawa's decision to redefine marriage.\n \n \"Let the country speak at the next federal election,\" Tory Senator Gerry St. Germain said hours before the bill passed. \"Let's not pass this legislation now. Let's wait. Let's make [the election] a referendum on this bill.\"\n \n The Liberals say only one tool remains at the disposal of anyone wishing to turn back the clock: the Constitution's so-called notwithstanding clause.\n \n No federal government has ever used that provision in the Charter of Rights, which allows governments to overrule rights deemed fundamental.\n \n The Tories and Liberals have sparred over whether the legislation was preventable. A top Liberal senator said Tuesday there was no end in sight to the bickering and that it was time to vote.\n \n \"There is no point in further postponement,\" said Jack Austin, the Liberal leader in the Senate.\n \n \"There are no new issues to be argued, there are no new positions to be taken.\n \n \"I think everyone in this chamber understands that we have -- along with the Canadian people -- come to our own conclusions.\"\n \n The Tories were hoping to amend C-38 to say marriage has traditionally been defined as the union of a man and woman.\n \n But the government side had two reasons for opposing the Tory move.\n \n First, they dismissed it as an insignificant and unnecessary change to the legislation.\n \n But proponents of same-sex marriage had a deeper fear: that the bill could potentially be scrubbed if any changes were made at this point. \n \n Amendments would have sent the bill back to the House of Commons, which is adjourned for the summer break, only to have it return for further debate in the fall.\n \n Since the Liberals have a minority government, they could theoretically be toppled at any time and legislation before the Commons would disappear if there were an election.\n \n The marriage legislation stems from a 2003 Ontario Court of Appeal ruling that the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage was unconstitutional.\n \n The government had fought same-sex couples in court but became a proponent of redefining marriage as courts in Ontario and seven other provinces sided with gays and lesbians.\n \n Then-prime minister Jean Chretien announced in June, 2003, that he would not appeal the Ontario ruling and that he would table legislation heeding to same-sex couples' wishes.\n \n Bill C-38 would extend same-sex rights to Alberta and P.E.I., the only two provinces where courts have not yet struck down traditional marriage laws.\n \n The legislation also stipulates that the new definition of marriage is only binding on public institutions like courthouses and city halls.\n \n It says religious institutions -- churches, mosques, synagogues and temples -- and individuals can continue defining marriage as they see fit.\n \n However, some public officials have said they fear they might lose their jobs if they refuse to marry same-sex couples because of their personal religious convictions.\n \n Justice Minister Irwin Cotler has said those individuals -- and their jobs -- will be protected by the legislation and by the Charter of Rights's guarantee of religious freedom.\n http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050720.wsamesex0720/BNStory/National/",

   "Canada became the fourth country in the world to legalize gay marriage nationwide after a landmark bill was signed into law on Wednesday.\n \n Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin signed the bill, and it was read in the House of Commons and Senate, making it law. The Senate voted late Tuesday to adopt the legislation to legalize gay marriage despite fierce opposition from Conservatives and religious leaders.\n \n The bill grants same-sex couples legal rights equal to those in traditional unions between a man and a woman, something already legal in eight of Canada's 10 provinces and in two of its three territories.\n \n The legislation drafted by Prime Minister Paul Martin's minority Liberal Party government easily passed the Senate, which essentially rubber stamps any bill already passed by the House of Commons, which passed it late last month.\n \n The Netherlands, Belgium and Spain are the only other nations that allow gay marriage nationwide.\n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8647610/",
