We call that a strawman. If you would've took the time to read my post, you would've understood that I wasn't saying \"Nobody heard of it.\" More so, I was saying \"Nobody cares. This will change nobody's views.\" The Obama crowd will still love Obama, and the McCain crowd will still vote for McCain. It's as useless as the presidential debates. If you think this excrement will persuade a single McCain voter to vote for Osama, then you need a good therapist. I suggest you read my posts from now on. Maybe that'll give you a clue about what I'm saying, kiddo. For quite a while, you were lurking in the depths of the CvE forum; after all, it's the only place you feel secure; the only place you think you can \"win\". It's almost like a homeless shelter for atheists. :) Okay, kid. You can go now. You'll run home screaming \"Mommy! Mommy! I got a boo-boo!\" Then again, it's not my fault that you refused to read my post.",

   "It's curious that MacCain denied Obama was an arab by contrasting that with \"He is a decent family man\" Well say no more, the two are obviously incompatible. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n You know that if McCain had included something like \"There is nothing wrong with being a Muslim\", his poll numbers would have dropped...\n \n I think Colin Powell gave one of the best statements on the issue...\"I'm also troubled by, not what Senator McCain says, but what members of the party say, and it is permitted to be said. Such things as 'Well you know that Mr. Obama is a Muslim.' Well the correct answer is 'He is not a Muslim, he's a Christian, he's always been a Christian.' But the really right answer is 'What if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country?' The answer is 'No. That's not America.' Is there something wrong with some 7-year old Muslim-American kid believing that he or she can be president? Yet I have heard senior members of my own party drop the suggestion he's a Muslim and he might be associated with terrorists. This is not the way we should be doing it in America.\n \n \"I feel strongly about this particular point because of a picture I saw in a magazine. It was a photo-essay about troops who were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. And one picture at the tail end of this photo essay was of a mother in Arlington Cemetery and she had her head on the headstone of her son's grave. And as the picture focused in you can see the writing on the headstone. And it gave his awards, Purple Heart, Bronze Star, showed that he died in Iraq, gave his date of birth, date of death. He was 20 years old. And then at the very top of the headstone, it didn't have a Christian cross, it didn't have a Star of David. It had a crescent and a star of the Islamic faith. And his name was Karim Rashad Sultan Khan. And he was an American, he was born in New Jersey, he was 14 at the time of 9/11 and he waited until he can go serve his counrty and he gave his life.\"http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/guestvoices/2008/10/powell_rejects_islamophobia.html",
