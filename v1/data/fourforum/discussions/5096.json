   "My info may be a little out of date...\n \n http://topica.com/ and AOL both host (or hosted) free listserves. I know that if you previously had a listserve with AOL, it is still active).\n \n Also, you used to be able to operate a listserve from a http://www.freeshell.org/ account. Be advised, though, that the last itme I operated a lsitserv from there, I was sitting in front of an Amstrad 1512 with DUAL 5 1/4 drives, the newest and fastest 2400 baud modem, and my new hard drive held 5 meg and cost $4000. So things may have changed.\n \n Have you contacted your ISP? A lot of ISPs will host your list for free if you lean on them a little. If yyou have some free web space with your account, you can almost certainly host it fromt here.",

Seems everything 'free' is now so plastered with ads finding the actual subject matter can be difficult.
