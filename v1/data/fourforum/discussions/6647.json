   "I heard a talk yesterday that many of you might have heard at a college campus near you. It was about a girl and guy code named \"amy\" and \"todd\". This was an actual case that happened some 10 yrs ago and the story is now told by a lawyer who was in the case.\n \n To make it some what short...\n \n Amy was a 5'4\" 125lb girl who was 19 and went out drinking on her college campus. She went to this one house at 11pm where she had 5 beers very quickly. Around 12am she met a guy named Todd who was a 6'0\" tall guy around 180lbs. The two began to hit it off and they danced for awhile. Todd asked Amy if she wanted some jello shots and Amy replied yes and Todd came back with 2 jello shots around the 12:30 time frame. The jello shots are special because Todd had helped back them with Everclear (90% alcohol). AMy had 2 and then Todd said that she requested some more. After the 5th one (at this time close to 2am) Amy ran outside throwing up. Todd had just gone away for a second and when he came back he went to find her. He found her outside throwing up and Amy asked to be taken home. Todd agreed and took her back to her home. Todd began to leave when Amy called back and asked for a glass of water...Todd agreed and gave her the glass of water. He then proceeded to leave again. Then Amy said \"wait\" and grabbed him and gave him a big kiss which led to some more... Any then ran off to the bathroom where she began to throw up some more. She came back BRUSHED HER TEETH and the two started to go at it again. Before they were about to engage in sex, Amy said she didn't want to because she might throw up everywhere. Todd said he was \"beyond the point of no return\". Amy still said no and Todd agreed. Amy then said she would get some rest until she felt better and then they would finish what they started. Todd testified that he sat for 20-30min watching TV while Amy was \"passed out\". She then woke up and said she FELT A LOT BETTER. She then began to make out with Todd again and the two engaged in sex at this point. Afterwards Amy went to bed and Todd left his name, number, and a note saying he had a wonderful time and wanted to see her again. The next morning Amy woke up hung over and saw the note. She didn't remember anything from last night and asked her roommate if she met a guy named Todd. Her roommate said \"no\" because her roommate was out all night. AMy then called the number and Todd, excited to see she called back so quickly, answered. Amy was confused and said she remember nothing. Todd then explained everything that happened between the two. Later on, because Amy was a virgin at the time, she went to the hospital on the advice of the police and later charges were filed against Todd for sexual assualt in the 2nd degree.\n \n Is Todd Guilty?\n \n If you know this case please don't give it away.\n If you have questions, ask me.\n \n The Law:\n Someone can't consent to sex if the person has reason to believe the other is MENTALLY INCAPACITATED or if the person SHOULD KNOW the other is MENTALLY INCAPACITATED. \n \n It is important to note a few things:\n 1) Being drunk is not mentally incapacitated. SEE LINK\n http://4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=172042&postcount=35\n 2) It is what the OTHER person(Todd) SHOULD HAVE KNOWN or DID KNOW at the time...not what was the actual state of Amy now that we know.\n 3) They engaged in sex around 5:30am...3hr30min after she threw up the first time (which was after the 5th jello shot)\n 4) Mentally incapacitated means the person doesn't have the ability to make rational judgements or think in a rational manner.\n 5) She did \"consent\" and did partcipate in the sex...there is not question here about \"no\" meaning \"no\"..it is more about \"yes\" meaning \"yes\"\n 6) He was a Bartender partime\n \n I'll lt some discuss it for a bit before I tell you guys the verdict and outcome. \n \n The audience I was in had 600 people...it was 50/50 for those that thought guilty or not guilty....Gender, race, or age didn't seem to matter in this figure.\n \n --I WILL POST THE VERDICT ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND THE REASON GIVEN TO ME FOR THE OUTCOME. I WILL ALSO GIVE MY VIEW AT THIS TIME AND POST LINKS TO THE SPEAKERS WEBPAGE AND NEWS ARTICLES.--\n A special thanks to the speaker for talking about this very important issue",

   "Ok, well, I think being drunk could definitely qualify as a mental incapacitation, and he knew she was drunk, so with these put together it sure sounds like it was assault. It all hinges on whether or not being drunk is a mental incapacitation though.\n\n \n Not to be rude to you but I commented on this in my first post.\n \n \n1) Being drunk is not mentally incapacitated.\n \n \n She was obviously in the mental incapacitated state but it matters about whether he KNEW this or SHOULD HAVE KNOWN this. Being drunk, however, is not always being mentally incapacitated. For example, you can be drunk and sign a contract and still have it be legal binding. However! If you are mentally incapacitated you don't have the ability to reason or make rational choices. The question from this becomes:\n \n Did Todd KNOW she was mentally incapacitated or SHOULD HE HAVE KNOWN that she was mentally incapacitated. \n \n I see this two ways.\n \n Did Todd have reason to believe that Amy was drunk but able to understand what she was doing in a way? She obviously didn't have a full ability to reason but a full ability of reason is not required. You can be dead tired no sleeping for 4 days and have a pretty limited ability to reason but you are not mentally incapacitated.\n \n Or Did Todd have have reason to believe that Amy was mentally incapacitated to a small degree. The thing is, do you need some evidence to show she was mentally incapacatiated or evidence to show that she wasn't? \n \n These are two sides:\n Evidence to show she was just drunk but had rational judgment- She brushed her teeth because she knew her breath was bad, She knew she would get sick if she had sex, she asked for a glass of water to make her feel better, she knew how to tell todd directions back to her place. \n Evidence to show she was without rational judgment and thus mentally incapacitated- She had 20 drinks total....5x3 for the jello shots and 5 beers, She threw up which actually makes you drunker, Todd was a bartender which could mean he should know her state(this could go either way actually), She passed out for a time of 30min.\n \n I think you were on the correct track of thinking though. Hopefully this clears up some things. All of this was presented in the Q/A session before we voted by the way.",

   "I would vote that Todd was guilty of the crime he was charged with because I feel like he violated the particular statute in question. Mainly, I believe that Todd should have known that Amy was incapacitated, and I believe so for two reasons. The first reason is that Todd was a bartender, and the second reason is that he contributed to the making of the supercharged jello shots. These two facts lead me to believe that, given all the events Todd witnessed throughout the course of the evening, he should have known that Amy was incapacitated.\n \n Given the nature of the specific issue, we necessarily receive a picture of Amy as victim, and given the particular point of law in question, I think it evident that she was. However, I also think it evident that Amy's lifestyle choice placed her in the position of victim in this trial. As she was drinking at the age of 19, Amy was in clear violation of the law (as was Todd on this point as well). I think it clear then that Amy's willingness to violate the law led to her condition of incapacity. I do not suppose this to completely alleviate Todd of all responsibility, but I do suggest that Amy is more than partially responsible for the incident.\n \n It seems as though this point has fallen through the cracks during this discussion. I do find it mind-boggling that Amy seems to only invoke a position toward the law that endorses the outcome she desires. By that I mean that on the one hand Amy seems to have no problem with the lack of enforcement of one statute (the one prohibiting underage drinking), while on the other hand desiring another point of law to be strictly enforced (the aggravated assault statutes). And, not surprisingly, her schizophrenic view of the enforcement of statutes is always in alignment with the way she desires to live. \"Don't drink while underage,\" one may say. \"But I want to. Those laws are stupid anyway,\" Amy replies. \"Well then, you may find yourself in the position of consenting to sexual activity when you probably wouldn't have were you not drinking,\" the reply goes.\" \"How dare someone do that to me,\" she says, \"Aren't there laws prohibiting that?\"\n \n Again, I do not suppose that Amy's lifestyle choices alleviate Todd of all responsibility. However, Amy's actions were in violation of the law, making her a criminal just like Todd.",

   "This is from the presentors webpage: \n \n \n Second, alcohol-induced incapacitation is a precise term. Yet, it is often confused with what I call the \"i-words\" that often are applied to alcohol use. There are five i-words: (under the) influence, impairment, intoxication, inebriation and incapacitation. They are not synonymous, and are more-or-less listed in order of severity of alcohol effect. One becomes under the influence of alcohol as soon as one has anything to drink. Impairment begins as soon as alcohol enters the bloodstream, and increases with consumption. Intoxication and inebriation are synonyms, as is drunkenness, and corresponds to a .08 blood alcohol concentration. Incapacitation is a state beyond drunkenness or intoxication. What is confusing about incapacity is that it has nothing to do with an amount of alcohol or a specific blood alcohol concentration. In fact, some drunk people will be incapacitated, and some will not. Incapacity can be defined with respect to how the alcohol consumed impacts on someone's decision-making capacity, awareness of consequences, and ability to make fully-informed judgments.\n \n Incapacity Defined\n Where someone lacks the ability to make rational, reasonable judgments as a result of alcohol (or other drug) consumption, they are incapacitated. Understanding and distinguishing the i-words is important, because except for rare religiously-grounded rules at colleges affiliated with various faiths, almost all colleges have policies based on incapacity. Some imprecision with the i-words results in lack of clarity, because policies attempt to give i-words that are not synonymous with incapacity the meaning of incapacity. Worse are rules that state that sex is prohibited with someone who \"is unable to consent as a result or alcohol or drug consumption.\" This language is less than artful, because we are often faced with complaints by students who are able to give consent, but claim they had no idea they were doing so-the so-called Blackout. This will be discussed at length, below. The main thing to understand is the regardless of what careless terminology is used, most colleges use an incapacity standard, which is also the legal standard for all state statutes. The most straight-forward way to compose a policy on incapacity is as follows:\n \"Having sex with someone whom you know to be, or should know to be, incapacitated (mentally or physically) is a violation of the sexual misconduct policy.\"\n Common-Sense Definition\n While it is precise to define incapacity as an inability to make a rational, reasonable judgment or appreciate the consequences of your decisions, I prefer a more common-sense definition: In order to consent effectively to sexual activity, you must be able to understand Who, What, When, Where, Why and How with respect to that sexual activity. Any time sexual activity takes place where the alleged victim did not understand any one of these six conditions, incapacity is at issue. An awareness of all six must be present. This is another way of stating the law's expectation that consent be informed, and any time it is not, consent cannot be effective. To be more precise, an incapacitated person cannot give a valid consent. They could be stark naked, demanding sex, but if they are incapacitated at the time, and that is known or knowable to the accused, any sexual activity that takes place is misconduct, and any factual consent that may have been expressed is IRRELEVANT.\n Assessing Incapacity\n Physical incapacities are sometimes quite overt, and other times more subtle. Incapacitation is a subjective determination that will be made after the incident, in light of all the facts available. Incapacitation is subjective because people reach incapacitation in different ways and as the result of different stimuli. They exhibit incapacity in different ways. Incapacity is dependent on many or all of the following factors:\n \u0095 Body weight, height and size;\n \u0095 Tolerance for alcohol and other drugs;\n \u0095 Amount, pace and type of alcohol or other drugs consumed;\n \u0095 Amount of food intake prior to consumption;\n \u0095 Voluntariness of consumption;\n \u0095 Vomiting;\n \u0095 Propensity for blacking-out (mentally or physically);\n \u0095 Genetics.\n \n Evidence of incapacity will come from context clues, such as:\n \u0095 A witness or the accused may know how much the other party has consumed;\n \u0095 slurred speech;\n \u0095 bloodshot eyes;\n \u0095 the smell of alcohol on the breath;\n \u0095 shaky equilibrium;\n \u0095 vomiting;\n \u0095 outrageous or unusual behavior\n \u0095 unconsciousness.\n None of these facts, except for the last, may constitute--in and of themselves-- incapacitation. But, the process of finding someone responsible for a violation of the sexual misconduct policy involves an accretion of evidence, amounting to a sufficient or insufficient meeting of the standard of proof, whether you use a preponderance of the evidence (more likely than not), clear and convincing evidence, or any other evidentiary standard. Some of these standards may be met with some combination of the first seven, or all eight factors. For example, it might be met if someone is passing in and out of consciousness, and there is a high probability they could pass out again. Or, it might be met if someone is vomiting so violently and so often that they are simply in such bad shape that they cannot be said to have capacity.",

   "Being a bartender, or even just a reasonably experienced person, Todd should have realised that Amy was extremely intoxicated.\n \n The one question I have is, was Amy mentally incapacitated? On the one hand, being drunk is not mentally incapacitated. On the other, she exibits several of the examples of incapacitation, such as the smell of alcohol on the breath, vomiting, outrageous or unusual behavior and unconsciousness.\n \n Todd should have realised that after those 20 drinks, even three hours later, Amy would have been very, very drunk. The question is, would he have realised that she may have been drunk enough to be mentally incapacitated? The fact that he tried to leave, and that she restrained him, would indicated to me that he realised she was too drunk.\n \n Using this set of tests: Who, What, When, Where, Why and How, I would have to say that Amy was probably not incapacitated. \n \n I would also suggest that Todd should have been able to make an accurate estimation of her state of mind. He knew how much she had had to drink, and would have been able to watch her behaviour change as the night progressed, and has the practical experience of being a bartender.\n \n The question is, I believe: Should Todd have believed that Amy was mentally incapacitated? My anser is a tentative no. She asked him to stay, demonstrated enough understanding to brush her teeth, understood that she may vomit during sex, understood enough to consent to sex. She knew who she was with, where she was, what they were doing and (one can only assume) why they were doing it. Were I in his place, I probably would not have assumed mental incapacitation either.

From the facts: \"Before they were about to engage in sex, Amy said she didn't want to because she might throw up everywhere. Todd said he was \"beyond the point of no return\". Amy still said no and Todd agreed.\" \"Amy then said she would get some rest until she felt better and then they would finish what they started.\" It turns out that Amy fully consented to what happened that night, and this is obvious from the exact point of law that Todd was charged with (aggrevated assault in the second degree, instead of forcible rape, etc.). The question (and Todd's guilt or innocence) hinges, as I have said in my previous two posts, on whether Todd should have known that Amy was mentally incapacitated. This is the only significant question in relation to the aggravated assault in the second degree given the circumstances of the case.\n \n I don't know if that changes your vote or not, but I though I would just point out again what determines guilt or innocence in this particular case, that point being should Todd have known that Amy was incapacitated?",

I actually feel this is very important for people to hear; even more so if they are in or going to be in college. There are a lot of things to learn from this case and a few I would like to point out right now.\n \n Rape is not sexual assault. The speaker actually used these terms interchangably as well but stated at the beginning how differenet they are and that it is important to know this. Rape has a strict definition and this would never fit rape. Sexual assault is could be said to be \"pre rape\" or \"rape light\" or something like that. This would be like touching a little kid in bad areas...that is sexual assault. Rape would be actually having sexual intercourse with the little kid. From that extreme example you can see the difference.\n \n Another thing, Drunk doesn't mean you can't enter into a contract. Drunk is a legal term which (in VA) means .08 blood alcohol level. You can actually enter in a contract drunk. Mentally incapacitated is a different story. This means you can identify who, what, where, when, why, and how for situations . Hopefully you guys can see and maybe even learn the difference.\n \n \n Also a special thanks to the speaker Attorney Brett Sokolow who told this case in front of 600 people and tells many across the US.",

She even said she wanted to but was afraid of throwing up again.\n So after feeling better she started up again with todd.\n However,depending on the state it was in he could have been charged with dispensing illegal alchohol.\n I use to use everclear in drinks I mixed (a Jack Kavorkian and a Raging Kermit) in Colorado where everclear is legal. \n But here in Michigan it is illegal (we have to drive to Ohio to get it and then bring it back.....which yes it is illegal if I give it to anyone or sell it).",

   "The case between Todd and Amy was one that is rarely heard in court but is very common on the college campus. There was a lot of evidence to go by and it appears most of you think he should have been \"not guilty\". In the audience I was in, it was more like 50/50.\n \n The jury got the case and decided it in 7 hours. The came back with a verdict that was probably not too shocking....Guilty. Todd was found guilty on 2nd degree sexual assault. Both him and Amy were charged and convicted for underage drinking. Todd was sentenced to 18 months in jail for his crime. He also had to register on the sex offender list and will be on that list for life. Todd was kicked out of school which happened to be one of the top 10 schools IN THE WORLD. Todd also is a registered Felon. Amy stayed in school for a bit but later dropped out. She has actually been to see one of speaches Attorney Brett Sokolow gives. \n \n Many might ask, why was Todd convicted? Well, believe it or not, Cone actually got most of the reasons correct. The jury found that it would be hard to say whether or not Todd knew of Amy's condition but the fact is, he SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. The jury felt that since Todd was a bartender, gave her the jello shots that HE made AND saw her condition the whole night that any REASONABLE person would come to the conclusion that she was mentally incapacitated.\n \n \n My Opinion:\n \n I have had a week to reflect on this case and hear others argue their points about whether he is guilty or not guilty. To be honest, it doesn't surprise me that he was guilty. I could easily see him being guilty actually. The juries job was to find what a reasonable person should have known in this situation. I think with different people this might have made a different outcome. I feel that a reasonable person could have reason to believe that Amy was \"drunk\" but not really \"gone\". She fact that she brushed her teeth and told him not to leave seems irrelevant to me because I believe she was pretty wasted at this point. However, she passed out for 30 minutes and woke up which makes me believe that she was ok. I have never seen anyone who was really bad off only pass out for 30minutes. I have seen a person that had too much to drink be awake and alert but it was clear she was mentally incapacitated. The girl I saw was saying she \"wanted to save the baby\" and really had no idea what was going on. In this case, Amy, seemed to have some understanding of \"who, what, where, when, why, and how\". She knew WHO Todd was, She seemed to know WHAT she was doing, She knew WHERE her apartment was, she seemed to know WHEN she would be better, she seemed to know WHY she couldn't have sex at first, she knew HOW to have sex as she was involved in the sex. All this does is leave reasonable doubt in my mind that Todd could have believed Amy was just drunk and not completly gone like the girl I had seen.\n \n The thing that angers me the most though is not that Todd was guilty, because I could see a reasonable person convicting him, but rather the punishment Todd got. Todd and Amy both FAILED the personal responsbility test. Neither one took the time to be responsible for their actions and to their actions to help another person. The fact that both of them were doing something illegal was what caused this whole thing to happen. In the end Todd paid for the his mistakes plus the mistakes of Amy. I hold Amy responsible for ruining Todds life. I hold Todd responsible for ruining Amy's life although Todds seemed to be more of a loss. If the outcome was 30 days or something and NOT on the sex offender list, I might have been ok with it. The fact that Amy felt she was victim is totally false. She was just as much a victim as Todd in my opinion. Justice would be done if Amy had to serve 2 yrs as well. Truely a sad situation.\n \n One last point. The sex offender list is the list that Todd is on. This list has people that have raped 5 random women and people like Todd. The amount of people on the list that are like Todd is actually bigger then many might think. I spoke with a psychologist the other day and he told me that people like Todd and other lower degree sex offenders really don't have a high re-offense rate. The news tends to show the rare ones that will reoffend. Now doesn't this make the list useless? If you lived next to Todd you would believe he raped a girl without ever knowing the truth. Is this fair? I would say not.\n \n \n \n I hope this case has been helpful to some. I hope some of you will learn to maybe be responsible for keeping yourself out of this situation.",
