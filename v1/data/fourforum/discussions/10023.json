   "Lead author Jeremy D. Long, along with collaborators Gabriella W. Smalley, Todd Barsby, Jon T. Anderson and Mark Hay found that's just what Phaeocystis does. Chemicals that signaled attacks from copepods suppressed the formation of colonies by 60 to 90 percent, while signals from ciliates enhanced colony formation by more than 25 percent. \n That quote from the article says volumes by the way. Its CHEMICALS that do the job. Strictly a mechnical response. Just good old biochemistry in action along with metabolic regulation etc. No intelligence required any more than in a plant growing differently when fertilized. Or a child NOT growing well in the absense of food.",
