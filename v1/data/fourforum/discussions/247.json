   "I was thinking about why we had a divide recently like we have just had. Britain always comes along, and Germany always follows. This is the first time Germany has not gone along with the US and opinion of the US is very low in Old Europe. What happened? \n \n The USSR fell. Why was Europe such a great friend before? Because we were deployed there to stop Russian tanks from coming through Germany and France and Britain. Now Russia is no threat. Now Old Europe hates us. \n \n So there it is, what I would consider a good link. That's why Europe hates us...I don't think they ever liked us. Maybe we've just been being used.\n \n Interesting thought.",
