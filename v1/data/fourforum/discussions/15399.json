   "That's right. We only hear about Paul Revere because of Longfellow's poem, yet most Americans would instantly answer Revere because they have never heard of Bissell.\n\n \n Paul Revere did not actually make his ride. He warned nobody, and turned out to be a coward.\n \n First, the \"one of by land, 2 if by sea\" in the old north church signal was a plan revere came up with for in case he could not get across the river. They could hang the lanterns and the riders on the other side of the river (we think there were about 40 people involved).\n \n A second rider was supposed to go with Revere. A guy named William Dawes. \n \n The REAL story of Paul Revere and his midnight ride pretty much makes him look like a mildly retarded, cowardly, nut job. \n \n First, he put together a small network of people to help sneak him across the river. There is some question about WHY he was on that side of the river at all, since the lantern in the steeple part worked just fine, so by the time he made it across the river all the other riders were gone. \n \n Anyway, so Revere has some people help sneak him across the river in a boat. When he gets to the other side, Dawes is waiting for him because while Dawes DID start out on the same side of the river as Revere, he just rode out of town on the main road and crossed the river at the bridge. It was completely unguarded, and the British had no idea who Revere or Dawes were at that point. \n \n So, after executing his ridiculously complex \"cross the river\" maneuver, Revere and Dawes set out. \n \n The got to Lexington and stopped to see Samuel Adams and John Hancock. What with all the time wasted playing around with ridiculously complex plans, not only were Adams and Hancock already aware of the information Revere was telling then (having been told by other riders much earlier). They had already sent messengers and spys out AND had them return and report in. They had decided that the british force would most likely be headed for concord. So, they sent Revere and Dawes on. Along the way they picked up a third, a guy named Samuel Prescott. \n \n They went for beer. Seriously. They went to a tavern to have a few. THEN they headed out for Concorde. This turned out to be something of a mistake. \n \n They were followed out of the tavern by a british soldier who found their behavior and conversation alarming. Yes. They got drunk and shot their mouthes off in front of a british soldier. He followed them while his companion rode ahead to get some british troops together to arrest the drunken ner do wells. \n \n Finally they got them at a roadblock near lincoln. Revere gave up immediately and without a fight. Prescott jumped his horse over the roadblock and led the british on a 2 hour chase before finally losing them. He made it to concord and warned the colonists there. Dawes fought his was free of the road block but, being hammered, fell off his horse when he tried to jump a log in the woods. \n \n Revere, who literally surrendered at the first sight of the enemy, then commenced to tell them EVERYTHING....including where Adams was hiding out. The british officer who oversaw the whole thing referred to him as \"eager to please\" and \"invaluable\". Those are NOT words you want the other side to use in describing you. \n \n So, they all headed back to Lexington, where they were going to arrest Adams and Hancock. \n \n As they were coming up on lexington, they heard shots coming from town Nobody is sure where the shots were coming from since there was nothing going on in lexington at that time. The best theory I have heard is that it was men clearing their muskets before going into the tavern. \n \n Revere convinced the british holding them that the colonists are at arms, and that they will be slaughtered if they try to enter town. The british end up releasing Revere, seizing his horse, and taking off to warn their commanders that the colonists are at arms. \n \n There is not actually any historic evidence that Revere actually managed to warn anybody about anything. By his own notes, he \"supervised\" the lighting of the lanterns at the church, and the riders across the river were gone long before he ever even crossed. By his own notes, Adams and Hancock knew everything when the showed up there.\n \n So, Palin is wrong, and picked a bad bit of American history to spout off about.\n \n At the same time, most of her critics are also wrong about what actually happened. \n \n IMO, anytime you are looking at an historic story that just happens to rhyme REALLY WELL, you should probably not take it at face value.",

   "This person says she was right..\n \n How Accurate Were Palin's Paul Revere Comments? : NPR\n\n \n \nPalin: We saw where Paul Revere hung out as a teenager, which was something new to learn. And, you know, he who warned the British that they weren't going to be taking away our arms by ringing those bells and making sure, as he is riding his horse through town, to send those warning shots and bells, that we were going to be secure and we were going to be free. \n\n Aside from sounding like a high school student giving a really bad commencement speech, she is wrong. So, she attempts it again...\n \n \nPalin: Part of Paul Revere's ride - and it wasn't just one ride - he was a courier, he was a messenger. Part of his ride was to warn the British that we're already there, that, hey, you're not going to succeed. You're not going to take American arms. You are not going to beat our own well-armed persons, individual, private militia that we have. He did warn the British. \n\n Yes, Revere worked as a courier since 1773, and I am sure he made many rides as such. But specifically, the subject she is speaking of is the \"midnight ride\" on April 18th, 1775. So yes, the ride in question was \"just one ride\". Daewoo does a great job explaining the purpose, intentions, errors, and actions on the night of April 18th. But Sarah seems to be easily confused. Revere was out to warn the colonists, specifically those tied to the patriot movement Sons of Liberty, not the British regulars who were marching into the countryside. Revere would have wanted to be as quiet and as sneaky as he could with regards to his mission (although he ate a couple bowls of loudmouth soup and got caught as per Daewoo). \n \n So along come dippy reporter and the professor. \n \n \nDippy reporter: And let's review Paul Revere's midnight ride, April 18, 1775. He's going to Lexington, Massachusetts. And according to Sarah Palin, he's riding his horse through town sending warning shots and ringing those bells. True? \n\n No, not true.\n \n \nProfessor: Well, he's not firing warning shots. He is telling people so that they can ring bells to alert others. What he's doing is going from house to house, knocking on doors of members of the Committees of Safety saying the regulars are out. That is, he knew that General Gage was sending troops out to Lexington and Concord, really Concord, to seize the weapons being stockpiled there, but also perhaps to arrest John Hancock and Samuel Adams, leaders of the Continental Congress, who were staying in the town of Lexington. \n\n It's not even likely that he was knocking on many doors, since the riders in advance of him probably had already alerted everyone allied with the patriot movement of the advance of the regulars. \n \n \nDippy reporter: So Paul Revere was ringing those bells? He was a silversmith, right? \n\n Uh...no dingbat. He was not ringing bells. \n \n \nProfessor: Well, he was - he also was a bell ringer. That is, he rang the bells at Old North Church as a boy. But he personally is not getting off his horse and going to ring bells. He's telling other people - and this is their system before Facebook, before Twitter, before NPR, this was the way you get a message out is by having people ring church bells and everyone knows there is an emergency. \n \n And by this time, of course, the various town Committees of Safety, militia knew what the signals were, so they knew something was afoot. So this is no longer a secret operation for the British. \n \n Revere isn't trying to alert the British, but he is trying to warn them. And in April of 1775, no one was talking about independence. We're still part of the British Empire. We're trying to save it. So this is a warning to the British Empire what will happen if you provoke Americans. \n\n No, he didn't ring any bells, and the towns and militia were most likely already alerted when Revere got to them. \n \n But here's where the professor begins to bother me. First, he never mentions the fact that the British regulars detained Revere. Second, and perhaps even more telling, he tries to make Revere into a messenger to the British regulars and the Brisith Empire that they will face harm if the \"provoke Americans\". The British Empire already feared revolt and revolution...which is why they were sending regulars into the countryside in the first place. They were given orders to sieze a stockpile of weapons and arrest the rebel leaders. The British were all too aware that the colonists were on the edge of revolt...no warning required. \n \n \nDippy reporter: So you think basically, on the whole, Sarah Palin got her history right. \n\n You mean except for the bell ringing and warning shots that Paul revere didn't do...and the fact that he was not out to \"warn the British\"...?\n \n \nProfessor: Well, yeah, she did.

   "Then they are both wrong. The evidence he was a Deist are that he didn't talk about religion in official speeches and he missed communion a lot. The evidence of Washington being a Christian was that his family directly stated as such after his death. This is like the 18th century version of calling Obama a Muslim. \n \n <<Pulls out John Adams book sitting next to him<<, yes, Adams was a Unitarian for much of his life.\n\n \n In his, \"A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America\" [1787-1788], John Adams wrote:\n \n \"The United States of America have exhibited, perhaps, the first example of governments erected on the simple principles of nature; and if men are now sufficiently enlightened to disabuse themselves of artifice, imposture, hypocrisy, and superstition, they will consider this event as an era in their history. Although the detail of the formation of the American governments is at present little known or regarded either in Europe or in America, it may hereafter become an object of curiosity. It will never be pretended that any persons employed in that service had interviews with the gods, or were in any degree under the influence of Heaven, more than those at work upon ships or houses, or laboring in merchandise or agriculture; it will forever be acknowledged that these governments were contrived merely by the use of reason and the senses. \n \n He may have be called a Unitarian, Deist, Atheist Or whatever, but His own words not from just the above quote but many quotes from speeches and letters will show without a doubt John Adams was not a Christian.\n Washington never spoke about his Religious beliefs in public or in Private. Even his diaries didn't speak of his views on religion. He was a Freemason and that led people to conclude that he was in fact a deist.\n \n But anyway.. We could debate this forever and never agree, the main point was that the Country was not Founded on Religion Or God as Modern day Fundamental Christians like to claim. Yes there was a Christian Influence, but no where near as big as people like to claim. I read in the encyclopedia that in 1800 only about 10% of the population were a part of a church congregation, so Claiming Christianity as the Religion for the whole country is kind of a stretch.",

   "Paul Revere did not actually make his ride. He warned nobody, and turned out to be a coward.\n \n First, the \"one of by land, 2 if by sea\" in the old north church signal was a plan revere came up with for in case he could not get across the river. They could hang the lanterns and the riders on the other side of the river (we think there were about 40 people involved).\n \n A second rider was supposed to go with Revere. A guy named William Dawes. \n \n The REAL story of Paul Revere and his midnight ride pretty much makes him look like a mildly retarded, cowardly, nut job. \n \n First, he put together a small network of people to help sneak him across the river. There is some question about WHY he was on that side of the river at all, since the lantern in the steeple part worked just fine, so by the time he made it across the river all the other riders were gone. \n \n Anyway, so Revere has some people help sneak him across the river in a boat. When he gets to the other side, Dawes is waiting for him because while Dawes DID start out on the same side of the river as Revere, he just rode out of town on the main road and crossed the river at the bridge. It was completely unguarded, and the British had no idea who Revere or Dawes were at that point. \n \n So, after executing his ridiculously complex \"cross the river\" maneuver, Revere and Dawes set out. \n \n The got to Lexington and stopped to see Samuel Adams and John Hancock. What with all the time wasted playing around with ridiculously complex plans, not only were Adams and Hancock already aware of the information Revere was telling then (having been told by other riders much earlier). They had already sent messengers and spys out AND had them return and report in. They had decided that the british force would most likely be headed for concord. So, they sent Revere and Dawes on. Along the way they picked up a third, a guy named Samuel Prescott. \n \n They went for beer. Seriously. They went to a tavern to have a few. THEN they headed out for Concorde. This turned out to be something of a mistake. \n \n They were followed out of the tavern by a british soldier who found their behavior and conversation alarming. Yes. They got drunk and shot their mouthes off in front of a british soldier. He followed them while his companion rode ahead to get some british troops together to arrest the drunken ner do wells. \n \n Finally they got them at a roadblock near lincoln. Revere gave up immediately and without a fight. Prescott jumped his horse over the roadblock and led the british on a 2 hour chase before finally losing them. He made it to concord and warned the colonists there. Dawes fought his was free of the road block but, being hammered, fell off his horse when he tried to jump a log in the woods. \n \n Revere, who literally surrendered at the first sight of the enemy, then commenced to tell them EVERYTHING....including where Adams was hiding out. The british officer who oversaw the whole thing referred to him as \"eager to please\" and \"invaluable\". Those are NOT words you want the other side to use in describing you. \n \n So, they all headed back to Lexington, where they were going to arrest Adams and Hancock. \n \n As they were coming up on lexington, they heard shots coming from town Nobody is sure where the shots were coming from since there was nothing going on in lexington at that time. The best theory I have heard is that it was men clearing their muskets before going into the tavern. \n \n Revere convinced the british holding them that the colonists are at arms, and that they will be slaughtered if they try to enter town. The british end up releasing Revere, seizing his horse, and taking off to warn their commanders that the colonists are at arms. \n \n There is not actually any historic evidence that Revere actually managed to warn anybody about anything. By his own notes, he \"supervised\" the lighting of the lanterns at the church, and the riders across the river were gone long before he ever even crossed. By his own notes, Adams and Hancock knew everything when the showed up there.\n \n So, Palin is wrong, and picked a bad bit of American history to spout off about.\n \n At the same time, most of her critics are also wrong about what actually happened. \n \n IMO, anytime you are looking at an historic story that just happens to rhyme REALLY WELL, you should probably not take it at face value.\n\n \n That is awesome. I openly admit I did not know that. It reminds me of a line from a TV show I once watched \"It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of sommbitch or another. Ain't about you (the immortilized), it's about what they (the masses) need.\"",

   "The liberal dumbocrats shouldn't act so superior. Here's something hardly any of them know about (or will admit to).\n \n Founding Fathers - Church Services in Government Buildings\n \n The Danbury Baptist Letter, as Originally Drafted\n \n The Library of Congress is grateful to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory for recovering the lines obliterated from the Danbury Baptist letter by Thomas Jefferson. He originally wrote \"a wall of eternal separation between church and state,\" later deleting the word \"eternal.\" He also deleted the phrase \"the duties of my station, which are merely temporal.\" Jefferson must have been unhappy with the uncompromising tone of both of these phrases, especially in view of the implications of his decision, two days later, to begin attending church services in the House of Representatives.\n \n Reserved Seats at Capitol Services\n \n Here is a description, by an early Washington \"insider,\" Margaret Bayard Smith (1778-1844), a writer and social critic and wife of Samuel Harrison Smith, publisher of the National Intelligencer, of Jefferson's attendance at church services in the House of Representatives: \"Jefferson during his whole administration was a most regular attendant. The seat he chose the first day sabbath, and the adjoining one, which his private secretary occupied, were ever afterwards by the courtesy of the congregation, left for him.\"\n \n The Old House of Representatives\n \n Church services were held in what is now called Statuary Hall from 1807 to 1857. The first services in the Capitol, held when the government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, were conducted in the \"hall\" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the \"Oven,\" which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Services were conducted in the House until after the Civil War. The Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. \n \n A Millennialist Sermon Preached in Congress\n \n This sermon on the millennium was preached by the Baltimore Swedenborgian minister, John Hargrove (1750-1839) in the House of Representatives. One of the earliest millennialist sermons preached before Congress was offered on July 4, 1801, by the Reverend David Austin (1759-1831), who at the time considered himself \"struck in prophesy under the style of the Joshua of the American Temple.\" Having proclaimed to his Congressional audience the imminence of the Second Coming of Christ, Austin took up a collection on the floor of the House to support services at \"Lady Washington's Chapel\" in a nearby hotel where he was teaching that \"the seed of the Millennial estate is found in the backbone of the American Revolution.\"\n \n First Catholic Sermon in the House\n \n On January 8, 1826, Bishop John England (1786-1842) of Charleston, South Carolina, became the first Catholic clergyman to preach in the House of Representatives. The overflow audience included President John Quincy Adams, whose July 4, 1821, speech England rebutted in his sermon. \n \n Woman Preacher in the House (and call for revival!)\n \n In 1827, Harriet Livermore (1788-1868), the daughter and granddaughter of Congressmen, became the second woman to preach in the House of Representatives. The first woman to preach before the House (and probably the first woman to speak officially in Congress under any circumstances) was the English evangelist, Dorothy Ripley (1767-1832), who conducted a service on January 12, 1806. Jefferson and Vice President Aaron Burr were among those in a \"crowded audience.\" Sizing up the congregation, Ripley concluded that \"very few\" had been born again and broke into an urgent, camp meeting style exhortation, insisting that \"Christ's Body was the Bread of Life and His Blood the drink of the righteous.\"\n \n Communion Service in the Treasury Building\n \n Manasseh Cutler here describes a four-hour communion service in the Treasury Building, conducted by a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend James Laurie: \"Attended worship at the Treasury. Mr. Laurie alone. Sacrament. Full assembly. Three tables; service very solemn; nearly four hours.\" \n \n Adams's Description of a Church Service in the Supreme Court\n \n John Quincy Adams here describes the Reverend James Laurie, pastor of a Presbyterian Church that had settled into the Treasury Building, preaching to an overflow audience in the Supreme Court Chamber, which in 1806 was located on the ground floor of the Capitol. \n \n \n The Old Supreme Court Chamber\n \n Description of church services in the Supreme Court chamber by Manasseh Cutler (1804) and John Quincy Adams (1806) indicate that services were held in the Court soon after the government moved to Washington in 1800.\n \n  Church Services in Congress after the Civil War\n \n Charles Boynton (1806-1883) was in 1867 chaplain of the House of Representatives and organizing pastor of the First Congregational Church in Washington, which was trying at that time to build its own sanctuary. In the meantime the church, as Boynton informed potential donors, was holding services \"at the Hall of Representatives\" where \"the audience is the largest in town. . . .nearly 2000 assembled every Sabbath\" for services, making the congregation in the House the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience then in the United States.\" The First Congregational Church met in the House from 1865 to 1868. \n \n House of Representatives, After the Civil War\n \n The House moved to its current location on the south side of the Capitol in 1857. It contained the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience\" in the United States when the First Congregational Church of Washington held services there from 1865 to 1868. \n \n Confirmed by: U.S. Library of Congress:\n \n Religion and the Federal Government: PART 2 (Religion and the Founding of the American Republic, Library of Congress Exhibition)",

You only make yourself look foolish when you spout nonsense.\n \n Paul Revere crossed the river to Charleston by boat, where he mounted the horse that was waiting and road to Lexington. William Dawes left Boston at about the same time and rode by land along the south bank of the Charles River. He arrived in Lexington shortly after Revere. Revere and Dawes left for Concord together and met Samuel Prescott who had carried a message from the militia in Concord to Lexington. As the three men rode together they encountered a mounted British patrol. Each of them rode in a different direction. Revere was captured (later released), Dawes and Prescott got away. Dawes was later thrown by his horse and then walked back to Lexington. Prescott made it to Concord.\n \nA second rider was supposed to go with Revere. A guy named William Dawes.\n\n Not with Revere.

They did not ride together.\n \nThe REAL story of Paul Revere and his midnight ride pretty much makes him look like a mildly retarded, cowardly, nut job.\n\n And the real story makes you look like a nut job.\n \n Any school child in Concord or Lexington can tell you the real story. Apparently, Concord and Lexington school children are smarter than you. I lived in Acton and taught in Concord. I have walked along parts of the Boston Post Road that ran from Lexington to Concord. Much of it is now followed by Route 2A. The British marched through Concord to the Old North Bridge. If you stand at the bridge and look across it you will see the hill where the minutemen were waiting. On top of the hill is the house where the munitions were stored (except the cannons that had been moved to Groton). If you turn to the left you will see a large stone marker that marks the grave of the first British soldier to die in the Revolutionary War. The British were forced to leave his body and retreat as they were under heavy fire. Behind the trees behind the grave marker there is the Manse where Ralph Waldo Emerson was raised. His father was the Parson. If you face directly away from the bridge there is a house. To the right of the front door there is a frame fixed to the wall. Inside the frame is a bullet hole made by a musket ball on April 19, 1775. The ball in still in that hole.\n \n About 1.94 miles SSE of the Old North Bridge, about 1.33 miles SSE of Concord Center, just across Rte 2 along Walden St. (Rte 126) you will find Walden Pond. The original is gone but there is a replica of Henry David Thoreau's cabin.\n \n About 3/4 mile from Concord Center towards Lexington on Lexington Rd (Rte 2A) is Orchard House, the childhood home of Louisa May Alcott. The house is the setting for Little Women.\n \n Wright's Tavern still stands in Concord Center. The Minutemen often met there and had assembled there on the morning of April 19. Later, British officers stopped in the tavern for some refreshment on their way to the Old North Bridge.\n \n There is also a house about 1/4 mile from Concord Center on Lexington Rd. As I recall, it is a white house with a white picket fence. Grape vines were growing along the fence. These are, of course, Concord grapes and the house was the home of Ephraim Wales Bull who developed the Concord grape in 1849. As I understand it, the original Concord grape vine is still growing on the property. You may be familiar with it as the grape from which Mogen David wine (Kosher) is produced, as well as Welch's Grape Juice, as well as many deep blue or purple jams and jellies.\n \n The Lexington Green is still there too.",

Here's something hardly any of them know about (or will admit to).\n \n Confirmed by: U.S. Library of Congress:\n \n Religion and the Federal Government: PART 2 (Religion and the Founding of the American Republic, Library of Congress Exhibition)\n\n Actually, I've read all of that before. I'm wondering why you think that it is relevant to the point of the OP. How does that make this a christian nation founded on christian principles? How does that make Jefferson a christian?\n \n Really! The religious practices of christian cults have nothing to do with the founding documents of our nation. Nor do those cult practices make christians out of Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, J.Q. Adams, or Jackson, or any other of the founding fathers. It is well known that Washington, Jefferson, and Madison sometimes attended religious services. But they weren't actually members of a church and didn't participate in any of the cultist rituals (confirmation, communion, etc.)\n \n So please explain the purpose of your cut and paste and how it applies to the OP, i.e., that this is not a christian nation founded on christian principles. It is a nation where christians live and are allowed to practice whichever cult they prefer without the right to impose their superstitious mythology on anyone else.\n \n Also, please explain why you think that the founding documents of our nation and the various state constitutions have anything to do with liberals and \"dumbocrsts.\" You are aware, aren't you, that the signers of all of the founding documents were liberals? The conservatives (loyal to the crown) refused to sign any of the documents. I'm wondering where you came by your twisted views.\n \n I note that you can't actually address the issues yourself and resort to irrelevant cut and paste and attempted insult. If you have a problem with Democrats, why can't you address them in a rational manner? Why do you feel that it is necessary to invent insults? The result of your childishness is that you are perceived as an airhead who can't actually offer intelligent debate. You offer only other people's thoughts and insult.\n \n The point is that if this is a christian nation then you should be able to point out specific phrases in our founding documents where these christian principles are evident. Whether or not Jefferson attended religious services or not is irrelevant. Whether he edited his letter to the Danbury Baptists is a nonsense argument. The point is that you can't point out a single line of any of our founding documents that gives any indication of a foundation in christian principles.",
