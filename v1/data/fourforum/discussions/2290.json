I wouldn't want to keep the Prime Minister waiting either.\n \n It may also be that the meeting was breaking up anyway and these two had already asked their important questions. It's just funny that they were first offended at the thought of a time limit and then chose to leave before the completion of the session.",

Once a person is under oath, the inquisitor can ask any question whatsoever, including something as insignificant as, \"What's your favorite TV show?\"\n \n I suppose a compromise that may have led to their willingness to testify under oath might be an agreement that they have  all  of the questions in writing before the meeting. Otherwise, they would open themselves to the expected vicious attacks of their political opponents.\n \n I think it would have been more enlightening to the public to have the questions and answers in writing...but you shouldn't expect sensible fair play from either side of Washington.
