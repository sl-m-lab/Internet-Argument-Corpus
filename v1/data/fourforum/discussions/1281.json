   "Even though I'm a native San Franciscan, I only recently have seen this movie. It was sort of a chick flick, but it was still well made and probably one of the best films I've seen. What I like about it is that they didn't seem to cut anything from Amy Tan's book, they said everything. \n \n At any rate, excellent movie.",
