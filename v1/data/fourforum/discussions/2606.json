   "Hi Ladywolf,\n \n I am also new here. I am normal (straight), and I am a christian. I don't hate homos because I have pity for them. Let me explain.\n \n I see how there are 3 groups of homos, and it also relates to other people as well, like drug addicts, etc.\n \n 1st group - they are homos, and live with their partners and are faithful to their partners (like you are), but they don't show off and often times you don't even realize that these 2 persons are gays.\n \n 2d group - a person is gay and he realizes that it is not normal, that it is a perversion, and he's trying to deal with it.\n \n 3d group - a person is a gay and he's proud of it, he's showing it off, goes to gay parades, leads TV shows, organizes gay websites and is actively promoting gay lifestyle.\n \n Okay, in all 3 cases a person is gay. In cases 1 and 2, his own lifestyle more or less is not affecting me. Right, these people can be very good and have virtues, and be otherwise morally good people, but they are gay, that's their problem, and they know they are different so they try to deal with it or at least not show it off.\n \n Now, 3d case is what we see everywhere, and we see more and more of it each year. This is becoming a problem. This is sick. I don't see parades for hetero families. I wish they were, though. But the fact that there are gay parades prove to me that this group of people active and want to challenge the society. Nobody would be that antagonistic to them if they didn't show off like that and actively display their sexual orientation. That's what causing the counteraction. \n \n So what's the problem with you, gays? Why do you want to propagade your lifestyle and why do you impose your thinking on everyone? If you just lived your life and didn't make it a big deal, like heteros don't make it a big deal, maybe you'd have less resistance.\n \n As for christian tolerance -- maybe you have a misconception of what it is for christians. There's no tolerance to sin. But there's love for the person. I say that I agree to talk with gays and be around with them, and if they asked me for help (other then help directly related to they gay actions), I'd render help as to any other person, but no, I would never agree with the concept of homosexuality, and I judge it, because I have this right.

   "I'm a married woman to a lovely danish man. We've been married for eight months now, and it has been a very very difficult process. INS is a hard thing to tangle with, and there are a lot of restrictions on this kind of thing. We have to be very careful about planning and traveling and taxes. However, I am very happy I just have the right as a citizen to marry whomever I wish. I think that this needs to be a right for everyone, not just straights. To me marriage is not about procreation...maybe once upon a time it was. However, if you look back on the history of marriage, it used to be simply about social connections and money. Now people view it as a way to express love for one another and show the world that they have made an honest commitment that will hopefully last a life time. Marriage has gone through several changes: Once marrying someone of a different religion, color, whatever, was taboo. It simply was never done, and those that tried were ostracized. They still are. However, people are learning and changing, and those types of relationships are becoming much more accepted, but we need to do more.\n The minute we say that one type of relationship is unacceptable, we proceed to shut the door on many other things. Many try to say condoning homosexuality is like condoning beastiality. These are stupid people grasping at straws to protect their ignorant fears. That's like saying that allowing freespeech is like condoning Nazism. To ban gay marriage is to make way for more restrictions to be made. What's next? You can't marry someone if you don't reach a certain IQ?\n And...also, look at the fact that..despite people's beliefs, America is not the most liberal of countries. Other places are doing a far better job of making things more free for their citizens. Quite a few parts of the European world have had Gay marriage for a long time, without ill results. Heck, Look at Denmark. A magazine ( I believe Time) rated Denmark as one of the least corrupt countries in the world. They have lower crime, and are more likely to slam companies for dishonesty, and work to keep their people equal. They also have gay marriage and protect their rights. If America truly wants to tout itself as land of the free, it best start comparing itself to the countries doing a better job of it before bragging.\n \n \n A Cynical American.",

   "Hello all. I am new here.\n \n I've been lurking a bit and wondered why homosexuality is even an issue for heteros? Is it because it's been hated or \"taboo\" for so long (a learned reaction perhaps)? As a heterosexual, how has homosexuality hurt or affected your life in any way? As a heterosexual, what gives you the right to dictate how homosexual people live?\n \n What if you have a non-christian living here in America (that would be me)...do you require them to live their lives the Christian way? Please explain.\n \n Thanks,\n Ladywolf\n \n \nWell Ladywolf, that is really more of an argument than it is an honest question. If marriage was truly a private affair that impacted nobody outside the couple themselves, then, yes, that question would be valid. But that is a very shallow understanding and a very uninformed understanding of the nature of marriage, because marriage is just as much - if not more so - about the community as it is about the couple themselves. \n \n But it's not the community that gets married.\n \n No, it's not the community that gets married, but it's the community that enforces marriage and develops marriage. We need to understand that marriage is just as much a social norm - a social ideal - of the kind of behavior that we expect and need for a healthy vibrant society; as much as it is about the emotional commitment of two people.\n \n One of the biggest issues is the social role of marriage. Marriage domesticates men. Men who are not attached permanently to a woman are men that will practice and engage in socially unhealthy behaviors at a much higher level. \n \n How will same-sex marriage effect the concept of \"marriage\"? Marriage becomes reduced down to nothing, because the moral argument for same-sex marriage is the same moral argument for group marriage, for polygamy, and it is going to be impossible to deny polygamous groups - and group marriage people - who come forth in all sincerity and say, \"If you can't restrict marriage to only couples of opposite sex, then you can't restrict marriage to only two people.\" They are all very much interwoven.\n \n The three things that you lose are: 1) the domesticating influence of marriage on men; 2) the protective influence of marriage upon women from being victimized and objectified by men; and 3) it provides mothers and fathers for children. \n \n When monogamy is lost as an ideal, the idea that a man should commit himself and forego all other sexual relationships but (the one with) his wife, then women become commodities to be used and collected by men. When committing yourself to a woman and subjugating your sexual desires for the sake of that woman - when that becomes just one lifestyle choice among many, it is devastating to a culture.\n \n Same-sex \"marriage\" also denies every child it touches access to either a mother or father. It is never compassionate to intentionally deny a child either a mother or father.",

Two men pacified in one ceremony! WooHoo!\n \n 2) Same argument for lesbians.\n \n 3) You do realize that you won't be required to marry someone your own gender, don't you? Lots of hets will still be getting married and breeding. I don't think we'll be running out of children any time soon.\n \n \n\n Same-sex \"marriage\" also denies every child it touches access to either a mother or father. It is never compassionate to intentionally deny a child either a mother or father.\n\n \n Your last point is really the only one that may be quasi-valid. There may be some benefit to a child having both a mother and a father, I'm not really sure one way or the other. However, I am sure the two parents of any gender is better than one. So if you're really concerned about child welfare stop wasting your time with gay marriage and do something about the appaling divorce rate.",

Or, that infamous insecurity of possibly being gay is haunting them. I view them (opposed) in the same light as people who condemn anything 'foreign' to their intellectually dark patch of existence.

And if you did live in the city as a straight without male and female gay friends and or social/business acquaintances, believe me, it had to be under a rock or on a military installation.

That policy would turn some very important principles upside down:\n \n Marriage would become merely an emotional relationship that is flexible enough to include any grouping of loving adults. If it is fair for two men or two women to marry, why not three, or five, or 17? The terms \"husband\" and \"wife\" would become merely words with no meaning.\n \n Parenthood would consist of any number of emotionally attached people who care for kids. \"Mother\" and \"father\" would become only words.\n \n Gender would become nothing.

It must rest on a \"Mister Potato Head theory\" of gender difference (same core, just interchangeable body parts). If real differences did exist, then men would need women and women would need men.

A few studies have shown that actually kids who are raised by same sex couples are more well adjusted then the other type. and Monogamy is not lost just because same sex couples marry, its simply another form of Monogamy.

   "Unnatural? 450 species willfully practice homosexulity, many of them our close relatives. Unhealthy? Unforuntely I must give you this one. And Immoral? because you say so? ;)\n\n The homosexual community seizes upon scanty evidence to justify something because they want it justified, not because they've examined the evidence carefully. They'll say animals practice homosexuality. How do they know that? Because they have seen male animals mounting other males, smelling each others rectums, or licking each others genital area. They will exclaim, \"See? It's obvious: homosexuality is natural.\" First, one must remember animals such as dogs also mount sofas, trees, and even your the leg. This is not homosexual behavior but this is auto-eroticism. Second, the only way one could show this behavior was homosexual is if one could demonstrate that the animal was desiring the male gender of the animal he was mounting. One can't conclude from the observed activity alone that any animal has homosexual desires. This is just another example of a hasty judgment. Third, animals either in playful antics, stressful conditions such as captivity, or in dominance behavior to assert hierarchy engage in perceived homosexual behavior. Male animals mount other males in a a very powerful way to communicate a higher position in the \"pecking order\". Fourth, every time you bring a female which is in heat into a situation, suddenly the male-male behavior is abandoned in favor of the female.Edited to add: Animals sometimes kill their young, roll in or eat excrement, have intercourse with numerous partners, and some engage in cannibalism. Man knows right from wrong and is not on the same level with the animal kingdom.

   "Homosexuality is immoral. \n\n To you and your bible it is. But the bible has no bearing on what our government does. (Or at least, it shouldn't...)\n \n \nThe source of moral judgment must lie outside of humanity, it must be changeless, and of an infinite perspective. \n\n But does it? Why does it have to?\n \n \nFor the Christian, that authority is the God whose will is expressed through the Bible and the traditions of the Church - both of which expressly condemn homosexuality. None of the world's major religions approve of homosexuality.\n\n Funny, but I thought that the Jews were ok with homosexuality. My cousin is Jewish and he's gay, but it's still kosher. :) \n \n \nHomosexuality transgresses natural law by subverting the propagation of the species. The consequences of transgressing natural law are often obvious; if you touch fire, you will be burned.\n Maybe homosexuality is a type of population control. Have you ever considered that? And like Phunting said, not a lot that humans do is natural. Are making skyscrapers and cars and flush toilets and airplanes examples of \"natural\" animal behavior? \n \n \n Surely, the long list of diseases associated with homosexuality is evidence of causation. \n\n And what diseases are you talking about? I haven't heard of a specifically \"gay\" disease. Perhaps you can enlighten me?\n \n \nAmerica must never allow this unnatural, unhealthy and immoral life style to become normalized.\n\n So we can oppress the minorities? The \"unnatural, unhealthy, and immoral life style\" that you describe is only immoral, unnatural, and unhealthy in your opinion. There is no basis for you to make an informed judgement on the morality, etc. of homosexuality except upon the faulty authority of a very old book.",

   "One can't conclude from the observed activity alone that any animal has homosexual desires.\n\n \n And one cannot conclude that from the observed activity that any animal doesn't have homosexual desires. \n \n Essentially your argument is: We don't know, therefore I am right. That doesn't win arguments. \n \n \"Just because this happens, doesn't mean this.\" That's all your argument is. While it does actually have facts, something i'm not used to seeing in the past 2 weeks after being on Whistlestopper, it still resides on \"this occurs, so therefore you might be wrong, therefore I am right.\" \n \n Sorry, doesn't work that way. Besides, real animal pyschology is still a relatively new field. \n \n On the topic of natural: Many things today aren't natural. Man was not suppose to fly. Man was not suppose to wear corrective lenses. Man was not suppose to live in towers hundreds of feet high. Man was not suppose to drive at 200 mph. All of that is unnatural. Yet all of it is supported, and even cheered by humans. Cessarian sections aren't natural, yet it is a common and accepted practice. Jumping out of planes for a HALO jump isn't natural, yet it's a key military inseration tactic. Man was not suppose to live 500 feet below the ocean. Man was not suppose to live in the artic. Man was not suppose to spend months at sea. Man was not designed to live in Space. Heck, I can do this for days. Much of what we do today that is accepted is not natural. To say that banning homosexuality because it is \"unnatural\" is hypocritical if you support the thousands of actions we do everyday that are unnatural.\n \n BTW: Thanks for ignoring the theories regarding homosexuality as a propagater of the species, as well as the legal measures, it's always nice to see they can't respond.",

   "Homosexuality is immoral. \n \n My morals have no more validity than those of the relativist, because we are both human, both fallible and of a limited perspective. Nor do the shared beliefs of a majority of people dictate morality. If nine of ten people find murder an acceptable practice, that does not make it so. The source of moral judgment must lie outside of humanity, it must be changeless, and of an infinite perspective. \n \n For the Christian, that authority is the God whose will is expressed through the Bible and the traditions of the Church - both of which expressly condemn homosexuality.\n\n \n Firstly, you cannot prove to me your assumption that God exists, therefore you cannot convince me you know what your God wants. You say you know God exists because the Bible tells you so, and the Bible was written by God. This is a cirucular fallacy of course, and is an attempt to avoid the unanswered and most important, question, does God exist? Without first proving that first question of God's existence, you don't know anymore about God in terms of what God wants, how and if God judges, God's sex, God's sexual orientation, how what and if God writes, etc.\n \n \nFor the nonreligious, the highest source of authority is the natural law. Homosexuality transgresses natural law by subverting the propagation of the species. The consequences of transgressing natural law are often obvious; if you touch fire, you will be burned. Surely, the long list of diseases associated with homosexuality is evidence of causation.\n\n \n If there were a natural law against homosexuality, humans would not be able to violate that law, nor would that law have to be enforced by humans.\n \n You argument for propagation of the species, through natural reproduction, I suppose, doesn't take into account a few things:\n \n Kin Selection: An animal doesn't reproduce directly itself, however may act as a helper and promoter of its family, by defending and hunting for its family, and reducing violent competition for females. \n \n Very little of sex that takes place leads to reproduction. If that is it's function, it is quite inefficient. Sexuality seems to have evolved to become inefficient, if reproduction is its only function. Even though my heterosexual partents had one child, I know each of them will have sex much more than one time in each of their lives. This ineffciency makes sexuality different from other evolved traits, or perhaps sexuality has other functions besides reproduction. \n \n What do we do with childless heterosexual couples, take away their marriage licences?",

   "Homosexual marriage will always be an abomination to God. When God calls something unholy, man cannot make it holy or bless it. Granting same-sex couples a license to marry will not create true marriage. Neither two men nor two women can become one flesh. Licensing the unnatural does not make it natural. It would be a state-sanctioned counterfeit, a sham and a fraud. Homosexual sex is dangerous and destructive to the human body and powerless for human reproduction.\n\n \n \n But see that's my point! Everybody thinks it's wrong because it's in a book called the Bible. But like I said you really can't go by everything in the bible because it wasn't written by God.
