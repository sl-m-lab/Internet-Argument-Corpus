   "This is some \"philosophizing\" I started today. \n \n Life and the Requirement of Reproduction?\n \n What is life? There are several ways of defining it, but one of the most common is by listing a set of shared, fundamental characteristics of all living organisms. Different sources list different characteristics, but most lists contain the following five: responsiveness (irritability), growth (development), reproduction, movement, and metabolism. But there are some living organisms that do not posses all of these properties. The particular characteristic I will focus on is reproduction.\n \n Inductive Logic Fails to Show that Reproduction is a Requirement of Life\n The view that reproduction is a required characteristic of life can be viewed as a conclusion reached by inductive logic. If we look at humans, which are alive, we see that they reproduce. If we look at dogs, which are alive, we see that they reproduce. The same goes for cats, birds, snakes, lizards, frogs, flies, worms, fish, squids, yeast, paramecia, E. coli, and so on: they are all alive and they all reproduce. But all inductive arguments hold absolutely only as long as no exception is found. A single counterexample is sufficient to disprove an inductive argument, and this particular 'pro-reproductionist' argument fails because of the stubborn mule. When a horse and a donkey are crossed, the resulting offspring is a mule, which, as a rule, cannot reproduce. Yet mules are surely alive. So we see that it is not an absolute requirement for something to be able to reproduce in order for it to be alive.\n \n Reasoning Fails to Show that Reproduction is a Requirement of Life\n Since the inductive method fails to hold, is there a reasoned, logical requirement for living things to reproduce? Most would say yes. Their first argument might go something like this: \n \n \nIf living things didn't reproduce, then life would quickly disappear. \n\n \n While that may be true, it fails to show that reproduction is a requirement in order to call something living: that living things would disappear as a result of their not reproducing doesn't show that they are not living before they disappear. \n \n \n [start: added 01/01/2006]\n In fact, even with reproduction, organisms - such as leopards, elephants, whales, and so on - will eventually die out. Does that mean that they are not living organisms now? Of course not.\n [end: added 01/01/2006]\n \n \n The \"pro-reproductionists\" second attempt, and improvement on the first, might go something like this: \n \n \nIf living things didn't reproduce, then life would quickly disappear: and since life has existed continuously on Earth for nearly four billions years, then life must be able to reproduce. \n\n \n While that may be true of life in general, all it really logically entails is that SOME - not all - organisms throughout all of life's history were able to reproduce. And at a smaller scale, it does not apply to any individual organism: it doesn't tell us that in order for organism X to be considered living that it must reproduce (take for example, mules). \n \n Must All Living Organisms Die?\n An implicit assumption in the last several arguments is that all living things must die. After all, if a living organism didn't die, then it wouldn't need to reproduce in order to persist, even for 4 billion years. We need to ask, \"Does this assumption of universal death hold?\" Yes, well, at least for all instances of life that we currently know of. Thus, it is a conclusion based on induction, not on necessity. \n \n Consider a species capable of repairing itself indefinitely. Sound far fetched? Well, we humans ourselves are desiring to do just that. And to an extremely limited degree, we have succeeded. Of course, we still have an enormous distance left before fully succeeding, but if we were to eventually do so, then could it really be said that reproduction is a requirement to consider humans as being alive? No. We'd be like \"immortal mules\": we'd be alive, yet incapable of reproducing ... but unlike mules, we wouldn't need to be continually replaced by reproduction. After all, we could stop reproducing (women might really like that idea!) and instead focus on repairing those that currently exist.\n \n Perhaps, though, we \"immortal mules\", by simply repairing ourselves and maintaining the status quo, would still somehow die: after all, nature shows us that those organisms that don't adapt to the ever changing conditions on Earth just don't last. Perhaps the changes in our environment would be too dramatic to be handled by simply replacing what is damaged with a new part. This line of reasoning fails since our intent is not simply to repair ourselves, but to improve ourselves as well. Humans intend to direct their own bodily evolution, either via installed hardware or through genetic manipulations, adapting our bodies to changes in the environment. \n \n And if we ever reach this ultimate goal (is it a good goal?!), then we could save energy by modifying our bodies to eliminate the no-longer-required processes involved in reproduction . \n \n Conclusion\n Based on the above lines of reason, I assert that reproduction is not an absolute requirement of life: that something could be considered to be alive without it necessarily needing to be able to reproduce.",

So why do we have reproduction? It is necessary for evolution to occur. Death, which is obviously NOT essential to life, is also required by evolution. With no cycle of birth & death there will be no adaptation to the environment, hence no evolution by natural selection. Of course, this would mean that life would have to remain at a very primitive autotrophic level. That, in turn, would mean that no new environments could be exploited. But, it is inevitable that some life form would fill every available niche by being able to change & adapt by - you guessed it - reproducing beyond the carrying capacity, or preying upon other life forms. So death comes onto the scene, along with reproduction and competition for resources.\n \n So, while reproduction is not essential to life, it is an inevitable consequence of life, as is adaptation, death and evolution. These things all seem to come with the package. And if there were life forms on other planets, the same would follow for them.",

   "Okay, what about Asimo? \n \n Asimo is Honda's humanoid robot (http://world.honda.com/ASIMO/new/). It has a head, body, two jointed arms and two jointed legs, and can walk - even up stairs, run - even cornering while running, carry and hand off objects to others, can recognize and interact with people, and so on.\n \n Okay, now I admit that Asimo is not living ... YET! For example, a human must charge it and then it will run for only about 40 minutes. But consider a future Asimo robot that was self-sustaining (perhaps by using solar power and fuel cells - who knows?) - why could it not be considered living? \n \n When considering whether or not robots can be considered living, the shared fundamental characteristics of life seem to me to break down. \n \n 1) Reproduction. This has already been addressed above. It has been tentatively accepted that reproduction is not required in order to consider something as living. And with robots, 'eternal life' and 'evolution' through maintenance and upgrades is considerably more plausible than it is for the hypothetical humans I discussed.\n \n 2) Metabolism. Is metabolism really required in order to consider something living? This, like most of the other fundamental characteristics of life, appears to be in the list based on INDUCTIVE reasoning. But we can surely ask, what if the FUNCTION metabolism performs - obtaining and utilizing energy to maintain the system and power its movements and actions - were achieved but without the standard biochemical reactions? Would that be sufficient?\n \n 3) Growth/Development. Is growth/delevopment really required in order to consider something living? This too appears to be in the list of shared fundamental characteristics of life based on INDUCTIVE reasoning. Why MUST something grow/develop in order to be considered living? \n \n Also, a potential counter example exists in biology: during very early embryonic development, the blastomeres that result from cleavage do not grow inbetween successive rounds of division: instead, the original egg cytoplam is subdivided into more and more, smaller and smaller, cells. These cells don't grow, but are surely alive. Perhaps it could be argued that they develop (since they pass through a set of stages), but that might be pushing the idea of development to an extreme.\n \n \n \n I'll stop at these three for now.",

If it does shut down completely, either we consider them to be living throughout the cessation of metabolism, or we consider them to die and later be resurrected: life coming from dead matter.\n \n And bacterial endospores can remain dormant for thousands (and some claims have been made for millions) of years.

Does this not group them together into a VERY SPECIAL class of entities? Does not intelligence - a trait that, before the origin of computers, was found only in living things, and even then, in only advanced life - group something into the realm of living? Inductively, before computers existed, what do we know of in nature that is non-living yet can think? Nothing.\n \n \nprschuster: You may make a case for a non-living, self aware, intelligent volitional robot, though.\n\n \n Yeah, I have little doubt myself that we will achieve that goal, assuming we don't blow up the world or succumb to our mistreatment of nature first. \n \n But I do have a good deal of doubt about whether the term non-living is correct for such an entity. If a future robot can do everything that a human can, but just does it by different means, then why shouldn't it be considered living?\n \n \nprshuster: This may seem like a small point, but the very biological definition of life is tied up with autopoietic chemistry that helps an organism maintain its integrity in a changing environment.\n\n \n But why does it HAVE to be biochemistry? Why can't a system that can capture enery from the environment and properly channel it through its body - electronic circuits and logic gates - in order to maintain homeostasis and upgrade itself, thereby performing the FUNCTION of biochemical metabolism (and evolution), count? \n \n And is it the OVERALL FUNCTION of maintaince/repair via controlled energy usage or the MECHANISTIC DETAILS that carry out that function that is important?

No. Does that mean dogs aren't animals? No.\n \n Are all processes life? No. Does that mean life isn't a process? No.\n \n I'm not defining life by saying it's a process, I'm saying that life belongs to the category of things we call processes and that this fact should influence how we define it. I don't understand why this perfectly simple concept eludes you. The hard part is the next bit:\n \n The questions 'what is life' and 'what is required for something to be alive' are fundamentally different. The former concerns the qualities of a process, while the latter is a question about a static state. I don't need to be reproducing or capable of reproduction in order to be instantaneously 'alive', but the same can be said for breathing, metabolising - anything, really. At some point - on some timescale - I'm not going to be doing at least one of the things we say life requires, and yet I'm still alive.\n \n IMO it's not reasonable to cherry-pick a particular creature and say 'this is alive and can't reproduce, therefore reproduction is not a requirement of life'. Reproduction clearly is a requirement of life: without it the infertile mule could not exist. Claiming that mules prove reproduction is not a requirement for life is like claiming that ugly, poor, short, ginger men with no sense of humour prove that reproduction is not a requirement for life.\n \n \nYou jumped into the discussion and showed everyone your \"far superior\" understanding of life, but you just made a joke of yourself. I simply pointed out how ridiculous your 'superior definition' of life was: how it only made things WORSE.\n\n \n I have no idea why you feel the need to be so unpleasant, but I'd be much obliged if you would cut it out. I wouldn't mind so much if you hadn't also misrepresented my argument - twice - into the bargain; rudeness or sloppy thinking can be tolerated, individually.",

No. Does that mean life isn't a process? No.\n \n\n \n My comments were clearly dripping - profusely - with sarcasm. Your replies are misdirected. It's kind of like me sarcastically saying, \"No Peeling, the moon is made of bleu cheese!\", and then you devoting time trying to explain why the statement \"the moon is made of bleu cheese\" is wrong. Well no duh!!!\n \n \nPeeling: I'm not defining life by saying it's a process ...\n\n \n Well why don't you just go ahead and give us your definition of life?\n \n \nPeeling: Reproduction clearly is a requirement of life..\n\n \n Provide us with the logic that demonstrates such.\n \n \nPeeling: ... without it the infertile mule could not exist.\n\n \n So are you saying that something has to be the result of reproduction to be alive? \n \n Why don't you just clearly state your definition of life, and exactly how reproduction fits into it.\n \n \n Before you do, consider the following. \n \n Humans have 'manufactured' a virus, and some scientists plan to create a bacterium from scratch. Now, if they eventually suceed, that bacterium will do everything that a normal bacterium does: will it be alive? \n \n And what if, for some reason (perhaps to prevent fears of the manufactured bacterium escaping the lab and spreading in the wild), they engineer some method of preventing it from reproducing. Then, it would not have been the product of reproduction, nor could it itself reproduce. Yet it would metabolize, move, respond to stimuli, and so on, just like all other bacteria. Would it be alive?",
