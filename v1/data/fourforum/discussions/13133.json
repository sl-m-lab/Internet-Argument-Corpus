   "August 16, 2009\n Editorial: Lining Up for Help\n We've been so caught up in dissecting the technical arguments over health care reform that it is easy to lose sight of the human dimensions of the crisis.\n \n That was impossible last week when we saw pictures of thousands of people waiting stoically outside an improvised clinic in Inglewood, Calif., near Los Angeles. It looked as if it was happening in an underdeveloped country, where villagers might assemble days in advance for care from a visiting medical mission. But it was happening in a major American metropolitan area. This vast, palpable need for help is a shameful indictment of our health care system - one that politicians opposed to reform insist is the world's best.\n \n The operation was run by a group called Remote Area Medical, which was formed to deliver care to Indians living in remote areas of the Amazon basin. It soon found great need here. It started delivering free services in rural America, progressed to medium-sized cities, and last week set up a free clinic at The Forum in Inglewood, where the Lakers used to play basketball.\n \n Teams of volunteer doctors, dentists, nurses and other professionals, using donated supplies, delivered free care starting Tuesday. They saw roughly 1,000 patients on the first day alone, but still had to give hundreds of people numbers to return the next day. By Thursday, they had committed all slots for the eight-day event and announced that they could not take any more patients.\n \n ....Judging from press reports, the people seeking help either had no insurance or inadequate insurance that required them to pay high deductibles and co-payments that they could not afford. Many had lost group coverage when laid off from a job and could not afford to buy their own policies on the open market. Some were denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions. Others had lost benefits when California's Medicaid program was cut back, and many simply could not find easy access to medical care except in an emergency room....\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/opinion/16sun1.html\n \n SHAME ON YOU, AMERICA! SHAME ON YOU!",

Unlike us enlightened capitalists, who realise that the State solves these issues.\n \n Communist China, back when it actually was communist, (or at least state-socialist, if you want to be pedantic), had state healthcare. Now its gone. Soon it may be back, mostly because the govt there wants to find some way to provide immediate stimulus to the economy and reduce the savings rate.",
