   "Sometimes when I rent the movie \"Lean on Me\" I wonder about the sad state of of schools in the US. If anyone recalls the movie, Morgan Freeman's character stated something I believe is so true: \"Discipline is not the enemy of enthusiasm!\"\n \n Joe Clark was Principal of Eastside high School in Paterson, NJ from '84-'93. His tough approach to discipline and emphasis om education brought much praise from across the country. I share a measure of personal experience in this. When I went to high school, we had a principal who, IMHO, was nothing more than milquetoast. That is, until my senior year when Dr. Paul A. LaFornara came to my high school. He brought a higher level of discipline and order and became one of South Park High's most popular principals. The point is, if you emphasize expression and creativity without discipline, then there will be problems.",

   "The flip side is that if you emphasise unearned respect and petty defference then you breed resentment and appear a laughing stock. I've seen headteachers at two schools try to exert \"discipline\" and run their schools into the wall because they haven't won the respect of their pupils, and merely appear arrogant and egotistical.",

   "Well on the topic of schools it appears to me like a headmaster or principal just needs to balance out the two opposite ends of the spectrum. When there is an assembly on drunk driving for example, that's probably when you want to enforce the rules pretty strictly. But like during a graduation ceremony where people tend to get a little giddy, let them have their fun as long as they're not being too disrespectful/creating a dangerous situation. Also, principals can't appear to try to be laying down the law. Maybe it's just me but it would be less inciteful to my innate rebellious side if someone told me to just use common sense when interacting with people then if someone laid down like Ten Commandments vaguely worded and the corresponding punishments to me. The former leaves the decision up to me and basically doesn't belittle my own way of thinking/common sense whereas the latter is really just saying to someone, you don't know how to act, here's how. I suppose that's why it's better to tell it to people that way.",
