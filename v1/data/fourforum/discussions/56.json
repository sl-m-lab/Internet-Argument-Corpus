   "America is blessed to have a Constitution, which is the acknowledged and universally affirmed supreme law of the land. There is no human law that is higher than the Constitution in the United States of America. The Framers intended for the Constitution to be a list of enumerated powers, a grant of authority from the people of the United States to the newly formed Federal Government. The \"Federalists\" where those who supported a stronger national government. To educate the public as to what their position was, as well as to defend it from the assaults made upon it by the likes of Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson, these men wrote what has since become known as the \"Federalist Papers.\" In these papers, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and others again and again assured the public and the detractors of the proposed Federal government that the powers granted to the Federal Government were \"enumerated.\" That means that the Constitution is a list of what the government can do. If it isn't in the Constitution, it cannot be done. That is illegal. The Federalists didn't think we needed a Bill of Rights... they thought it was self evident that since it was a list of enumerated powers, no rights of the people could be infringed! Fortunately, wiser heads prevailed, and everyone agreed that they would ratify the new Constitution, provided that a Bill of Rights was immediately written and passed. The Founders wanted to specially mention and protect certain rights. 2nd on this list of special rights was the right to keep and bear arms. The text of the 2nd Amendment is as follows: \n \n \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n \n Before going further, I'd like to spend some time defining the terms we find in the 2nd Amendment. \n We'll start with the word \"militia.\" What is the militia? The U.S.C. (Title 1, Subtitle A, Part 1, Chapter 13, Section 311) defines the militia as, \"all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.\" (Section 313 of title 32, raises the maximum age for entrance into the National Guard for former military personnel.) Webster's 1828 Dictionary defines the word \"militia\" like this: \n \"The body of soldiers in a state enrolled for discipline, but not engaged in actual service except in emergencies; as distinguished from regular troops, whose sole occupation is war or military service. The militia of a country are the able bodied men organized into companies, regiments and brigades, with officers of all grades, and required by law to attend military exercises on certain days only, but at other times left to pursue their usual occupations.\"\n \n So now we know that the word \"militia\" was intended by the Founders to refer to the body of citizens eligible for military duty. Notice how in \u00a7 311 the National Guard is distinguished from the militia. \n The next item to define is the term, \"well-regulated.\" Webster's 1828 Dictionary's definition of the word, regulated: \n \"Adjusted by rule, method, or forms; put in good order; subjected to rules or restrictions.\"\n Another definition, this time from the Oxford English Dictionary (2nd Edition, 1989):\n 1) To control or direct by a rule, principle, method, etc. \n 2) To adjust to some standard or requirement as for amount, degree, etc. \n 3) To adjust so as to ensure accuracy of operation. \n 4) To put in good order.\n The correct definition we are looking for here is \"to put in good order,\" according to Alexander Hamilton, in the Federalist Papers #29. \n Next word we will deal with is the word \"people.\" There has been some twisting of that word by certain parties, and so it will be good to see how the Founders defined it. Some gun control advocates try to say that the word \"people\" here refers to a collective body of people, (a state) meaning there is no personal right to keep and bear arms. How could this be? Does the 4th Amendment refer to a \"collective\" right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures? That is obviously nonsense. Why would the Founders use the word \"people\" if they meant the states? Surely they were capable of expressing exactly what they meant. If they had meant there was only a collective right, and not an individual right, they would have said it. \n Now we will deal with the next phrase, \"keep and bear.\" This is pretty self-explanatory. \"Keep\" means that the people have a right to own arms, and \"bear\" means they have the right to use them. \n Last but not least, we'll discuss what the word \"arms\" means. This is very important, for even if we correctly interpret the rest of the amendment, we still have the chance to go wrong here. The relevant definition in Webster's 1828 is as follows: \n \n \"Weapons of offense, or armor for defense and protection of the body.\"\n In his paper, \"The Right to Keep and Bear... What?\" Alo Konsen speculates that the word \"arms\" means more than just what has traditionally been considered small-arms (rifles, shotguns, and handguns). Mr. Konsen speculates that the word \"arms\" encompasses nearly the whole of the modern military arsenal. (See Mr. Konsen's paper, http://www.cga94.com/contributors/stuff/arms/iii.htm to see his explaination.) For the purpose of this paper, I will content myself with the definition that the word \"arms\" means weapons that can be borne by infantry, especially firearms. \n \n I believe the primary goal of the 2nd Amendment was to show a preference the Founders had to a militia over a large standing army. For instance, in the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton said, \n \n \"[I]f circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their rights and those of their fellow citizens.\" (Federalist #29) \n \n Noah Webster also weighed in on the subject: \n \n \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretence, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power.\"\n \n Notice I said that the preservation of a militia was the 2nd's PRIMARY goal. It's secondary goal is to protect individual weapon ownership. If you had suggested to the Founders that the 2nd Amendment didn't protect an individual right to keep and bear arms, you would have had quite a debate on your hands. Here is what some of the Founders said concerning firearms: \n \n \"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.\" -- Proposed Virginia Constitution, 1776 Thomas Jefferson \n \n \"When the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man, who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them; but that they should not do it openly, but weaken them, and let them sink gradually.\". . . I ask, who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers.\" -- Virginia's U.S. Constitution ratification convention, 1788 George Mason, of Virginia \n \n \"The said Constitution [shall] be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press, or the rights of conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.\" -- Samuel Adams of Massachusetts, Massachusetts' U.S. Constitution ratification convention, 1788 \n \n \"The Constitution preserves the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation. . . (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.\" -- James Madison of Virginia, The Federalist, No.46 \n \n \"[A]rms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property. . . Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.\" -- Thomas Paine of Pennsylvania, Thoughts On Defensive War, 1775\n \n Can anyone suggest that they didn't intend an individual right to keep and bear arms? That of course would be absurd. The Supreme Court has repeatedly refused to hear 2nd Amendment cases since 1939, so our hands are tied for now. \n In closing, I will say that America has fallen far to give up so essential a right so easily.",

   "Mr. Konsen, \n \n First let me say I'm very pleased to meet you. I have personally cited your paper (but you may already know that. emoticon_smile ) \n \n However, I disagree with your definition of the word \"arms.\" While we could indeed, in a very broad way, interpret arms to mean any weapon, I do not think that was the intent of the Framers for this simple reason: They were very much opposed to the states posessing warships. I should think we'd have seen a big fuss if that wasn't the originial intent of Madison et al. However, the national-level government was much against the state's posession of warships. Arguably, the states could say they were exercising their militia powers. However that argument didn't hold water, and the states were forced to disband (or actually sell to the Feds, as I recall) their warships. \n \n Don't you think that means there are limits? \n \n Guncite.com (who links to your paper) says it like this:\n \"In Colonial times \"arms\" usually meant weapons that could be carried. This included knives, swords, rifles and pistols. Dictionaries of the time had a separate definition for \"ordinance\" (as it was spelled then) meaning cannon. Any hand held, non-ordnance type weapons, are theoretically constitutionally protected. Obviously nuclear weapons, tanks, rockets, fighter planes, and submarines are not.\"\n \n If the Feds chose at some time to supply the militia with ships and cannon (as you showed in your paper) I think it was in excess of 2nd Amendment rights. Not a bad thing by anymeans (seeing as we are at the opposite pole today) but I don't think it means that all arms are protected by the 2nd. \n \n Also, I'm squeemish about circulating such an amendment as you propose (which could do no harm if done correctly) simply because I fear it'll be abused in the present political atmosphere toward civilian ownership of weapons in general and guns in particular.",

Now with the 1916 Act the Feds can take control of the N.G. anytime they want to. \n \n The N.G. has lost it's independace to the Federal government.

   "Not only the most overturned, but wrong in this case at least. \n \n \n Evidence of an Individual Right \n \n In his popular edition of Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England (1803), St. George Tucker, a lawyer, Revolutionary War militia officer, legal scholar, and later a U.S. District Court judge, wrote of the Second Amendment: \n \n The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, and this without any qualification as to their condition or degree, as is the case in the British government. \n In the appendix to the Commentaries, Tucker elaborates further: \n This may be considered as the true palladium of liberty... The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible. Whenever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\n Tucker's remarks are solid evidence that the militia clause was not the sole reason for preserving the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Tucker specifically mentions self-defense. This indicates two things: The scope of the right to keep and bear arms was not restricted to military purposes or the common defense (just such a provision was rejected by the Senate), and that \"the people\" means individuals, not a collective entity, and not a state. \n (William Blackstone was an English jurist who published Commentaries on the Laws of England, in four volumes between 1765 and 1769. Blackstone is credited with laying the foundation of modern English law and certainly influenced the thinking of the American Founders.) \n \n In the Federalist Papers, No. 29, Alexander Hamilton clearly states membership in a well regulated militia is not required for the right to keep arms: \n \n What plan for the regulation of the militia may be pursued by the national government is impossible to be foreseen...The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious if it were capable of being carried into execution... Little more can reasonably be aimed at with the respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped ; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year. \n ---The Federalist Papers, No. 29. \n After James Madison's Bill of Rights was submitted to Congress, Tench Coxe (see also: Tench Coxe and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, 1787-1823) published his \"Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution,\" in the Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 He asserts that it's the people (as individuals) with arms, who serve as the ultimate check on government: \n As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow-citizens, the people are confirmed by the next article in their right to keep and bear their private arms. \n \"Coxe's defense of the amendments was widely reprinted. A search of the literature of the time reveals that no writer disputed or contradicted Coxe's analysis that what became the Second Amendment protected the right of the people to keep and bear \"their private arms.\" The only dispute was over whether a bill of rights was even necessary to protect such fundamental rights.\" (Halbrook, Stephen P. \"The Right of the People or the Power of the State Bearing Arms, Arming Militias, and the Second Amendment\". Originally published as 26 Val. U. L.Rev. 131-207, 1991). \n Earlier, in The Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788, while the states were considering ratification of the Constitution, Tench Coxe wrote: \n \n Who are the militia? are they not ourselves. Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom. Congress have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birth-right of an American...The unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people. \n William Rawle's \"A View of the Constitution of the United States of America\" (1829), was adopted as a constitutional law textbook at West Point and other institutions. In Chapter 10 he describes the scope of the Second Amendment's right to keep and bear arms: \n \n The prohibition is general. No clause in the constitution could by any rule of construction be conceived to give congress a power to disarm the people. Such a flagitious attempt could only be made under some general pretence by a state legislature. But if in any blind pursuit of inordinate power, either should attempt it, this amendment may be appealed to as a restraint on both. \n This is another quote where it is obvious that \"the people\" means individuals since Rawle writes neither the states nor the national government has legitimate authority to disarm its citizens. \n (In 1791 William Rawle was appointed as a United States Attorney for Pennsylvania by President George Washington, a post he held for more than eight years. He was also George Washington's candidate for the nation's first attorney general, but Rawle declined the appointment.) \n \n A lengthier quote from Rawle, and more quotes from St. George Tucker are presented in the quotes from commentators section. \n \n \n More quotes from the Founding Fathers. \n \n The Early Supreme Court \n \n There were only three Second Amendment related Supreme Court cases in the 19th Century. Here is a quote from the case of Presser v. Illinois, 116 U.S. 252 (1886) : \n \n It is undoubtedly true that all citizens capable of bearing arms constitute the reserved military force or reserve militia of the United States as well as of the States, and in view of this prerogative of the general government...the States cannot, even laying the constitutional provision in question [the Second Amendment] out of view, prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms, so as to deprive the United States of their rightful resource for maintaining the public security, and disable the people from performing their duty to the general government. \n At the time of this decision the entire Bill of Rights was considered inapplicable to the states. It served as a limitation upon only the federal government (Barron v. Baltimore, 1833). Regardless of this limitation, the Presser court wrote that the right to keep and bear arms existed for \"all citizens capable of bearing arms\" and the states could not infringe upon this right. \n \n \n \n http://www.guncite.com/gc2ndpur.html",

Then there is no reason for the government to deny me the purchase of a nulcear weapon if I can find a seller.\n \n The simple fact that I cannot maintain nuclear weapons with MORE responsibility and GREATER saftey than the Department of Defense is reason enough for me that I do not want to own them.
