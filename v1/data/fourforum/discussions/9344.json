This totally shows it (it's an article printed today), and really, it's not hard at all to find articles like this. \n \n And for people being attacked because they \"looked gay\", here are some stories I found like I promised: http://uk.gay.com/headlines/1776 which tells how a man was beaten because they thought he was gay, and here is one about a soldier whose head was beaten to a pulp because other soldiers thought he was gay - no one knows if he truly was, it just hapened because of the suspicion that he was (quotes an article from the Kansas City Star): http://www.gaymilitary.ucsb.edu/ResearchResources/PressClips/news3_9_00.htm\n \n \n Here is another sick example of a man beating his 3-year-old son to death because he thought he was gay: http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/07/071405childMurd.htm\n \n Still waiting for peteratwar's  sources.",

   "Dealing with 1st and last, Please don't forget I'm not a US citizen so don't know all the ramifications of the constitution and its various amendments.\n\n Then perhaps you should figure that out before you presume to criticize others for not knowing how reality works...\n \n \n \nAs to the last, not sure what your problem is, typing in Daily Mail and Barrymore gives you a start into this horrendous story.\n\n Probably because \"gay rape\" is one of the STORIES being told about how this guy died. A story being promulgated by the FAMILY of the deceased. Not an official indictment by the police\n You claimed it as fact, failing to mention the other side of it.\n \n \n \nI seem to remember this argument got caught up in democracy and the protection of minority groups and their rights or what they consider to be their rights.\n Nothing in any aspect of Democracy stops the majority in the last resort from stating their aspect of what they want shall prevail. The vote of the majority is the democratic way. \n\n And how many pure democracies are there?\n In 1967, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that interracial marriage laws were unconstitutional, people believed interracial marriage to be wrong by a margin of 3 to 1. Over 70 percent were against interracial marriage.\n It was not until the late 80's / early 90's in the U.S. that there was FINALLY a shift away from a majority against interracial marriage, to a majority for interracial marriage.\n (And note, that's nation-wide. So obviously some states probably STILL existed which had majorities against it.)\n \n Should the majority have outlawed interracial marriage in the U.S. until the late 80's/early 90's?\n \n \n \nHaving said that I would bet the vast majority of people believe that minorities should have the same basic rights under the law as anyone else.\n\n Yes. I'm sure they do \"believe\" that.\n But whether or not they follow through on their belief is another story.\n History is rife with a minority being oppressed by the will of the majority.\n \n \n \nLaws are created by human beings with their foibles beliefs and way of life at the time they are legislating. They will do their best but cannot foresee every eventuality that will come in the future. Your Constitution is only another set of laws albeit at a higher level and with no liklihood of being discarded at a whim. However, there is nothing stopping amendments being put forward which can change/amend delete or insert the law and the Constitution. These can all be voted on through normal process.\n\n This is true.\n Except a majority in this country, according to repeated polls, are against amending the national constitution to implement restrictions against gay marriage.\n At least twice (before political elections) has the vote been held to amend the national constitution. Twice it's been shot down.\n \n \n \nIt follows therefor that a majority decision will ultimately win even though it may be deemed to be stupid or irrational. Prohibition ?\n\n I've brought up the interracial marriage example with you before, and you ignored it.\n Please address it, because pointing to one case where the \"majority ultimately win\" is not the same as proving that the \"majority ultimately win\".\n My example shows the majority NOT winning over a course of two decades.\n And then the majority shifted.\n \n \n \nSo sooner or later the majority of people have to agree changes. When you take an instituion such as marriage, then you are starting to move into core areas of peoples' beliefs. You are perfectly entitled to feel very strongly on the subject (which is evident in many threads). However so are your opponents to change. They also feel very stongly on the subject. They feel they are backed by millenia of social and society norms whereby marriage is between two people of opposite gender. You may feel this is outdated and wrong, they do not with equal fervour.\n\n You seem to believe that the \"beliefs\" of the people and the laws are inexpliciably and automatically linked. They are not.\n A majority in this country believe in the Christian religion. They believe that not being Christian is a sin.\n Yet they acknowledge a right to freedom of belief to NOT be Christian.\n \n Likewise, all I am talking about is that YOU follow your beliefs about gay marriage, and not enter into a gay marriage if you don't approve, and allow me to follow mine.\n Why the hell is my gay marriage any of your damn business in the first place?\n What right have you to impinge upon my life and tell me that my marriage should not be recognized?",

   "Constitutional Republics are a deliberate attempt to diminish the threat of mobocracy thereby protecting minority groups from the tyranny of the majority by placing checks on the power of the majority of the population. The power of the majority of the people is checked by limiting that power to electing representatives who govern within limits of overarching constitutional law rather than the popular vote having legislative power itself. Moreover, the power of elected representatives is also checked by prohibitions against any single individual having legislative, judicial, and executive powers so that basic constitutional law is extremely difficult to change. John Adams defined a constitutional republic as \"a government of laws, and not of men\"...\n \n The original framers of the United States Constitution were notably cognizant of what they perceived as a danger of majority rule in oppressing freedom and liberty of the individual. For example, James Madison, in Federalist Paper No. 10, advocates a constitutional republic over a democracy to protect the individual from the majority. The framers carefully created the institutions within the Constitution and the United States Bill of Rights. They kept what they believed were the best elements of majority rule. But they were mitigated by a constitution with protections for individual liberty, a separation of powers, and a layered federal structure.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy#.22Democracy.22_and__.22Republic.22\n \n Thus endeth the history lesson. Now maybe we can discuss reality, rather than makey-up fantasy justifications for anti-Constitutional discrimination.",

I am still on the basis of how society evolved and how democracy arose. Open to abuse as anything else but as a basis better than anything else be it a dictatorship under various forms be it secular, theorcratic or whatever. In its humblest form it is basically ideal. You haven't given any real indication yet that you understand the bases on which your Founding Fathers acted. Clearly minority opinions have a right to exist and your Constitution was created with their protection in mind and with the laudable intention of equality for all.\n \n A point you seem to have difficulty in understanding is, that your constitution which is,after all, basically a set of laws was promulgated by human beings, voted on by human beings and came into being as a result of those majority votes. It therefore often raises point of interpretation for which you have a Supreme Court to decide those points.\n \n As far as I can see, given sufficient will there is nothing stopping amendments being made to the constitution which can change what was originally set up. If the constitution is to be nothing more than dead wood then clearly this is vital.\n \n The Founding Fathers clearly did the very best they could to reconcile various demands and for 250 years they did a pretty good job, but they could'nt foresee everything. Rights of one party can in one way often impinge on the rights of other parties. One person or group can claim something as their right which if granted may act badly against the rights of another person or group.\n \n What for instance makes you think that marriage is a fundamental right ? I know of no physical or scientific law which makes it so, or even any law.\n \n Given the age in which they lived I suspect I would be astonished if the idea of homo-sexual marriage had ever entered in to the dreams of the Fathers of the Constitution. Marriage having been around for millennia on an opposite sex basis with no-one seriously arguing against that concept.\n \n I am not anti-constitutional nor am I blind to the faults of a mob-rule democracy. However, a pure democracy will always have that danger and a democratic republic will always have minorities complaining that their rights have been infringed. The fact remains that if the minority claims are rejected be it by democratic process (direct voting) or by constitutional process then tough, that is it. Minorities do not rule that is indeed a dictatorship. I was also pointing out that in the last analysis as far as I can tell and given the will majority voting can and has changed the constitution in the past\n \n PS was away on holiday",

Just admit that there have been no conclusive findings (for what, the last six years I beleive it was?) and stop promoting a story based on conjecture that was very likely dishonestly spread by the family, especially if foundit and I are correct and they do have a civil suit and are trying to squeeze out more money.",

And, as you say it doesn't change the prevalence of violence. Besides that, rape has nothing to do with a person's sexual attraction, so even if this did occur, it does not mean the perpetrator was a homosexual.",
