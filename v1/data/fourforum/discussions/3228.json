   "The goals of al-Qaeda, whom we generically label the terrorist, are pretty clear. \"The principal stated aims of al-Qaeda are to drive Americans and American influence out of all Muslim nations, especially Saudi Arabia; destroy Israel; and topple pro-Western dictatorships around the Middle East. Bin Laden has also said that he wishes to unite all Muslims and establish, by force if necessary, an Islamic nation adhering to the rule of the first Caliphs.\"[1] They struggle against what they see as moral decay in Muslim countries that coincides with Western and primarily American economic influence in the region as well as America's lopsided support of Israel against \"occupied and oppressed\" Muslims. \n \n The goals of the neoconservatives and their organizations, such as PNAC, are also quite clear. Some of PNAC's fundamental propositions declare \"that American leadership is good both for America and for the world; that such leadership requires military strength, diplomatic energy and commitment to moral principle; and that too few political leaders today are making the case for global leadership.\"[2] They intend to struggle against resistance of those opposed to global American leadership, which is a nice way of saying dominance or hegemony. This is not to suggest that only PNAC subscribes to these ideals. I believe that they are the basis for most of American foreign policy since WWII.\n \n So now the question arises. Is the struggle between al-Qaeda and the U. S. government an ideological one or a territorial one? Is it merely a fight between two opposing schools of thought regarding how Muslim countries should be run and who should run them? Is it a fight between democracy and theocracy? Or, is this a struggle for territorial dominance? Is the fight over who will eventually control the region economically and militarily?\n \n \n [1] http://www.infoplease.com/spot/terror-qaeda.html\n [2] http://newamericancentury.org/",

Where people don't die, they just committ suicide when they lose all their money in the market ;0\n \n More to the point...the war PNAC seems to be supporting is basically getting most of what we consider \"physically dangerous to the freedoms of other humans\" on the capitialistic boat. Once they adopt the market as their battlefield, I don't see where the military needs to step in. So I agree, it's those outside the global economy that pose the biggest problem.\n \n However, even after everyone is on board with the global economy, wouldn't you still like to be the one with the biggest stick? I dont know...maybe some future generations will get to make that decision.\n \n -Mach",
