   "A RIVETING and hugely satisfying report on BBC Radio 4 today tells the story of a missionary who was charged by an American missionary group with taking the Gospel to the little understood Pirah\u00e3s tribe in the Amazon - only to realise how ridiculous his faith in Christianity was.\n \n Daniel Everett, 57, a linguist in the Departmental Chair of Languages, Literatures and Cultures at Illinois State University, told presenter John McCarthy on the Excess Baggage programme, that he had travelled to the Amazon in the 70s to bring the tribe \"the joy of faith\" only to discover that they were a deeply contented people. In fact they seemed far better contented than he was.\n \n Tribe members asked the missionary whether he had seen or experienced any of the things he was telling them about. He had to admit that he hadn't; that he was simply passing things onto them that were told to him by people who hadn't seen or experienced them either.\n \n The Pirah\u00e3s, he said, \"believed that the world was as it had always been, and that there was no supreme deity\". Furthermore they had no creation myths in their culture. In short, here was a people who were more than happy to live their lives \"without God, religion or any political authority\".\n \n Despite Everett translating the Book of Luke into Pirah\u00e3 and reading it to tribe members, the Pirah\u00e3s sensibly resisted all his attempts to convert them.\n \n According to a report in the New Yorker:\n  His zeal soon dissipated ... Convinced that the Pirah\u00e3 assigned no spiritual meaning to the Bible, Everett finally admitted that he did not, either. He declared himself an atheist ...\n ....\n The book concludes with Everett saying:\n  The Pirah\u00e3s have shown me that there is dignity and deep satisfaction in facing life and death without the comforts of heaven or the fear of hell, and of sailing towards the great abyss with a smile.\n \n And they have shown me that for years I held many of my beliefs without warrant. I have learned these things from the Pirah\u00e3s, and I will be grateful to them for as long as I live.How an Amazonian tribe turned a missionary into an atheist\n \n I think this is thoroughly relevant to some \"Christians\" who routinely show that they have no clue as to how non-Christians (or sometimes specifically atheists) live.\n You see this approach in the mentality that \"You don't have a god? Therefore I believe you cannot have a morality\" approach. emoticon_emb\n \n Unfortunately, people like that have wrapped themselves so tightly in their mental cocoon that no ray of independent thought could penetrate their brains.\n \n I also found the \"he was simply passing things onto them that were told to him by people who hadn't seen or experienced them either.\" line very interesting.\n I've talked to some Christians who talk of \"miracles\", but when pressed for specifics the conversation suddenly drops.\n If you read Jesus's words, he PROMISES that his followers will be able to perform miracles in his name. The bible describes these miracles that his followers should be capable of.\n So why can't Jesus's followers perform miracles today??? emoticon_emb",

You went a step further to claim: \"He was no better off spiritually than one when he arrived than when he left.\"\n Furthermore, you can't claim \"agreement\" with me when your position is fundamentally different from mine on this type of issue.\n It's like me thinking that there are cars of every color, and you claiming that cars are only blue.\n I point to a red car and say \"That's a nice red car\" and then you agree???\n \n You fail to realize the two different positions.\n From my opinion...\n I recognize how his soul was NOT content before he went to missionary work. His faith was \"empty\" because it gave him nothing.\n \n For you to echo that sentiment, from YOUR position, is thoroughly bizarre and inexplicable.\n You see, I don't believe he lost anything there. His faith was going to leave him a rotting corpse in the ground like all the rest of us.\n But YOU believe the faith will bring a person from \"hell\" to \"heaven\", making your claim thoroughly unexplainable.\n \n Unless you're going to try to say he was never going to \"heaven\" in the first place, your position is nonsensical.\n \n \n \nThe fact is that if he truly had accepted Christ as his personal savior he never would have abandoned his faith for a tribe of atheists.\n\n Wow.\n I just find that an amazing claim.\n You think that if a person changes their belief from Christianity to something else, then they were never really \"Christian\" in God's eyes in the first place?\n \n Wow! What amazing mystical powers of pretense you have...\n That, and you have an uncanny knack for alienating people. And there is a whole group of ex-Christians out there who have seriously struggled with their faith, and eventually came to a realization against their personal belief in Christianity, that you are now alienating...\n \n \n \nEven your atheist source says this:According to Wikipedia, Everett \"was having serious doubts by 1982, and had lost all faith by 1985 after having spent a year at MIT.

I knew you would want to see it that way.\n Everything is binary to you. Either it's pro-Christian, or it isn't... It's either good, or it's bad.\n What you don't seem to want to admit or realize is that this guy's Christian beliefs were not working for him. It didn't bring him peace.\n (And looking at you Archie, it is really hard for anyone to assign a label of \"peace\" to you based on your actions which result in anything but...)\n \n The point of all this was explained in the original post.\n There are OTHER BELIEF systems out there that CAN and DO make people happy and contented.\n \"Christianity\" isn't the only option, and it doesn't work for everybody.\n There are a lot of people who seriously TRY to make it work, but it doesn't for them.\n \n In YOUR head, you see that as a condemnation cause you build Christianity up on a pedastal.\n In my opinion, it is NOT a condemnation, but rather a recognition of reality. NO religion (even atheism or agnosticism) is \"the\" universal answer for everybody who is out there.\n But there are some people (like you Archie) who pretend it is THE ONLY \"truth\" around...",

After reading the article in the Guardian this is the most relevant part which applies to his family situation.\n His wife, Keren, and three children were all \"committed\" Christians. Extraordinarily, Everett couldn't tell them of his loss of faith until the late 90s. \"I kept hoping that I might get my faith back,\" he says. He likens telling his wife to coming out as gay. \"I said, 'I just can't do this any more, I can't pretend, I don't believe this stuff.' So she immediately called the kids to tell them. It was just such utter shock and revulsion.\" Did they feel betrayed? \"Yes, they felt betrayed. My youngest daughter said, 'Were you a hypocrite the whole time you were raising us? Did you teach us to believe one way, which you never believed?' I did believe. I had a genuine, sincere conversion experience. I was quite a successful evangelist. I've had people write to me and say, 'Gee, I'm a Christian because of you and I hear you're not a Christian, that's shocking to me.' I don't take these things lightly but that's who I am. I can't change it.\"\n \n Murder is rare among the Pirah\u00e3. The only punishment they regularly practice is ostracising members of their society. It seems a bitter irony that Everett's loss of faith caused his ostracism not from the Pirah\u00e3, but from his own family. His marriage broke up. \"After a couple of months I tried to get us back together and she said, 'Only when you come back to religion will I even consider it', and I said, 'Well, then it's over.'\" Two of his grown-up children, Shannon, a missionary like her mother, and Caleb, an anthropologist like his father, cut off all contact. Three weeks ago, after the death of a close friend, they got back in touch for the first time in years. \"Now they are coming around.\" An almost imperceptible tremor registers in Everett's voice. \"Maybe I'm coming around. We're approaching one another and realising the most important thing is love.\"",

That he couldn't says more about his education, training and experience.\n\n \n The thing you fail to recognize is that Christianity had a \"good reason\" for faith in it, EVERYBODY would believe...\n At best, it has \"reasons\" that often get debated, and some people view them as poor justification.\n \n Another problem with your assessment is you fail to recognize the NATURE of faith...\n \n faith: firm belief in something for which there is no proof \n It isn't about \"education\" or \"training\", at least not in the sense that EDUCATION is involved. Quite frankly, I have come to see on this board and many others that I know more about \"the bible\" than many of its self-proclaimed followers...\n If you were using \"education\" as a euphemism for \"indoctrination\", that probably would have been more appropriate.",
