   "Today a great leader was forced to retire by a backstabber. Jean Chr\u00e9tien is stepping down today to be replaced by Paul Martin as the 21st Prime Minister of Canada.\n \n I don't trust Martin because of some of the shaddy deals and things he's done like taking gifts and other bribes from big business. Especially with his manipulation of the federal budgets, while he was finance minister, to make himself look good for a possible stab (and I do mean stab) at being the PM. Chr\u00e9tien had dismissed him for this.\n \n He is way too conservative for my tastes. I think that I'll be voting NDP in the coming election since voting for Martin would be like voting for either the PCs or XXXX.",
