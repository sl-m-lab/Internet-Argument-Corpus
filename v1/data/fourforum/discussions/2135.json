Woodward also contended that the Saudis were told about U.S. plans to attack Iraq before Secretary of State Colin Powell was. <<(This is laughable. Colin helped draw up the plans.)\n \n \n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4779686\n \n On Monday, a Saudi official issued a statement saying the kingdom --the world's largest oil exporter -- will not interfere with U.S. elections and will remain a reliable supplier of oil.\n \"We do not use oil for political purposes; it is too important a commodity, and its impact on the global economy (of which we are a part) is tremendous,\" said Adel Al-Jubeir, foreign affairs adviser to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\n \"Saudi Arabia also does not interfere in elections,\" Adel Al-Jubeir said.\n \n \n http://www.wtrg.com/prices.htm\n \n Kerry's charges are just another example of Democrats slinging lies around in a futile attempt to win an election. It will get even worse as we approach November.\n \n \n http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-04-20-saudi-us_x.htm\n \n And below, my dear friends is evidence of Democratic bias. Why hasn't Kerry denounced the election year secret requests of Carter and Clinton.\n \n http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2004/4/20/140959.shtml\n \n Tuesday, Apr. 20, 2004 02:03 PM EDT \n Prince Bandar: Clinton Sought Secret Oil-Election Deal \n Saudi ambassador to the U.S. Prince Bandar bin Sultan said Monday that ex-President Clinton sought a secret deal to keep oil prices low before the 2000 election, explaining that the request was nothing unusual. \n \n \"President Clinton asked us to keep the prices down in the year 2000,\" Bin Sultan told CNN's \"Larry King Live,\" responding to a claim by Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward  that the Bush administration made a similar request this year. \n \n Bin Sultan said President Carter also made a request for lower oil prices to save his reelection bid in 1979, explaining that he did so \"to avoid the [US's economic] malaise.\" \n \n \"We always want any president who is in office to be reelected,\" Bin Sultan explained, while stressing that his hope for lower oil prices was not a direct effort to influence the outcome of the U.S. election. \n \n \"This not our call.

So Bush gets relected now if Bush is realy looking for votes he whould be pushing the issue insted of a coupon like gimmic before the election. and as far as me being emotional Jim just remember who started the personal attacts on me yesterday it was you that got emotional first.

The event,\n expected to\n draw about 25 of the letter-signers, is being organized by a newly\n formed\n group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.\n \n \"We have 19 of 23 officers who served with [Kerry]. We have every\n commanding\n officer he ever had in Vietnam. They all signed a letter that says he is\n unfit to be commander in chief,\" O'Neill said.\n \n O'Neill, an attorney in Houston, Texas, is no stranger to Kerry. O'Neill\n served in the same naval unit as Kerry and commanded Kerry's swift boat\n after Kerry returned to the United States.\n \n Kerry's command of the PCF boat lasted four months and ended shortly\n after\n he received his third Purple Heart. According to naval regulations at\n the\n time, any soldier who received three Purple Hearts could request a\n transfer\n out of the combat zone.\n \n Kerry and O'Neill engaged in a nationally televised debate in 1971 on\n \"The\n Dick Cavett Show\" over Kerry's allegations that many Vietnam soldiers\n had\n routinely engaged in atrocities such as raping and cutting off ears and\n heads of Vietnamese soldiers and citizens. Kerry was the then spokesman\n for\n the anti-war group Vietnam Veterans Against the War.\n \n \"We are going to be presenting a letter that deals with Kerry's\n unfitness to\n be commander and chief that has been signed by hundreds of swift boat\n sailors, including most of those who served with Kerry,\" O'Neill\n explained.\n \n \"The ranks of the people signing [the letter] range from admiral down to\n seaman, and they run across the entire spectrum of politics, specialties\n and\n political feelings about the Vietnam War,\" he added.\n \n Among those scheduled to attend the event at the National Press Club and\n declare Kerry unfit for the role of commander in chief are retired Naval\n Rear Adm. Roy Hoffman, who was the commander of the Navy Coastal\n Surveillance Force, which included the swift boats on which Kerry\n served.\n \n Also scheduled to be present at the event is Kerry's former commanding\n officer, Lt. Cmdr. Grant Hibbard. Hibbard recently questioned whether\n Kerry\n deserved the first of his three Purple Hearts that he received in\n Vietnam.\n Hibbard doubted the severity of the wound and whether it resulted from\n enemy\n fire.\n \n \"I've had thorns from a rose that were worse\" than Kerry's wound for\n which\n he received a Purple Heart, Hibbard told the Boston Globe in April.\n \n Organizers are confident that Tuesday's event and the letter with\n hundreds\n of signatures would educate people about Kerry.\n \n \"It is one of the largest outpourings of concern about him being\n commander\n in chief that anybody could have in a presidential campaign, and it is\n by\n the people who know him best,\" O'Neill said.\n \n 'Unfit Commander in Chief'\n \n Swift Boat Veterans for Truth maintains that Kerry's fellow Vietnam\n veterans\n are almost uniform in their disdain for his military service and\n anti-war\n protests.\n \n \"Not only a majority of the people who served with him feel that way,\n but a\n vast and overwhelming majority,\" O'Neill said. He added that more than\n \"90\n percent of the people contacted by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth\n responded\n to the request to sign their name, with only 12 declining to sign.\"\n \n \"Comrades who actually served with him, almost all of them, are opposed\n to\n him, and believe he would be an unfit commander in chief and intend to\n bring\n the truth of his actual record to the attention of the American people,\"\n O'Neill said.\n \n He hopes the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth can reveal to the American\n people\n what he sees as Kerry's flawed character.\n \n \"In the military, loyalty between commanders and the troops serving them\n is\n a two-way street. We have here a guy that with all of us in the field,\n actually fighting the North Vietnamese, came home and then falsely\n accused\n all of us of war crimes at a time when the people in uniform couldn't\n even\n respond,\" O'Neill said.\n \n \"And he did that knowing that was a lie,\" he added.\n \n 'Real John Kerry'\n \n B.G. Burkett, author of the book \"Stolen Valor\" and a military\n researcher,\n believes that Tuesday's event will not be dismissed easily by Kerry's\n campaign as a \"partisan\" attack.\n \n \"There are probably just as many Democrats amongst sailors who sailed\n swift\n boats as there are Republicans. What Kerry fails to realize is this has\n nothing to do with politics; this has to with Vietnam veterans who\n served,\n who have a beef with John Kerry's service, both during and after the\n war,\"\n Burkett told CNSNews.com.\n \n \"The American people do not know John Kerry, and hopefully the swift\n boat\n crews and other Vietnam veterans will make sure that the American public\n knows the real John Kerry,\" he said.\n \n Jim Loftus of Kerry's press office referred questions about Swift Boat\n Veterans for Truth's event on Tuesday to spokesman David Wade. Wade did\n not\n return CNSNews.com's requests for comment.",

Look at your side of the fence because there are vermons there too like the Whitehouse. What is over the horizon is Kerry is going to fix all of Bushs screwups when he gets to the Whitehouse. Why dont you talk about Bushs failing to take a physical. What I'm getting at here is Bush has flaws too and it time to face the facts about him.",

Why don't you defend that worthless man or refute what his fellow servicemen are saying?\n\n What you call worthless is like what we have in the Whitehorse now. Now Bush probably paid his fellow service men off I don't buy into that **** it has no merit. Further more I am glad you want to live in a war & hatred society you know someday we keep ticking these terrorist off they might and blow up your trailer park. We are doing nothing about peace and Bush never will that man does not know what the meaning of peace is. I am sure that Bush had a lot of friends in the service yea right. They hated him there too so what you are getting at has no merit.",
