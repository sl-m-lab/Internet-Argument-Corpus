   "Another example of hypocrisy and double standards within the Gay Community.

Rather, all too miserably, those who should naturally join in fighting discrimination find it more comforting to join their oppressors in oppressing others. As a gay man of color, I see this on a routine basis - whether it be racism in the gay community or homophobia in communities of color...\" \n \n Whiteness in the gay community is everywhere, from what we see, what we experience, and more importantly, what we desire. Media images now popular in television and film such as Will and Grace, My Best Friend's Wedding, In and Out, XXXXX as Folks, XXXXX Eye for the Straight Guy, The L-Word, etc. promote a monolithic image of the \"gay community\" as being overwhelmingly upper-middle class - if not simply rich - and white. Even the most perfunctory glance through gay publications exposes the paucity of non-white gay images. It's almost as if no gay men or women of color exist outside of fantasy cruises to Jamaica, Puerto Rico, or the \"Orient.\" And even there, we apparently only exist to serve the needs of the largely gay white population seeking an \"authentic\" experience of some kind. To the larger gay community, our existence, as gay men and women of color, is merely a footnote, an inconvenient fact that is addressed in the most insignificant and patronizing way. Sometime between Stonewall and Will and Grace, gay leaders, along with the gay press, have decided that the best way to be accepted was to mimic upper middle-class white America.http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2006/76/gaysofcolor.html",

   "There is no doubt that racism exists in the gay community, as it sadly does in every community. It is, of course, something to be addressed and fought against. I don't quite understand the post, however. \n \n Bigotry exists in all communities. You are right that it is amazing that one oppessed community turns on another. In fact, there is a fair amount of homophobia among the gay community. That is the illogic of bigotry.\n \n However, the examples given are not apt. The \"white\" visibility of gays in such things as \"Will and Grace, My Best Friend's Wedding, In and Out, XXXXX as Folks, XXXXX Eye for the Straight Guy, The L-Word\" comes from the straight world. These are representations of gays that the mainstream media feel are palatable to Ozzie and Harriet. Many of the criticisms in that article should be addressed to straight folk, not gays. \n \n Racism and sexism in the gay community are topics that are addressed commonly. There are books and articles and seminars and classes and .... about this all the time. There are many who are trying to address this from within. As one example, being a black, gay man is dually difficult. (Probably harder than being a black lesbian.) However, most the of difficulty comes from the lack of acceptance from blacks, rather than gays. (Granted, this is coming from a white guy and it is a generalization.) This was mentioned in the article as well. \n \n As Dane said, this seems to be more of an attempt to criticize gays than a concern about the bigotry.",

   "I know you guys like to evade responsibility for your communities shortcomings by projecting onto me, but here is the introduction from the link I posted. Stay on point if you will or get off the thread. I didn't create this problem, I just posted the thread. The issue seems to come from alot of angles so grow up and deal with the issues being raised by your community. Oh, and foundit; don't ever accuse me of being afraid of taking on an issue in the Gay Rights Forum again. ;) \n Introduction\n \n A gay youth of colour was speaking with sadness about his experiences in Calgary's gay community: \"I seems like the racism is worse here than in the greater community.\" In an effort to make the world not seem as bad as it was being experienced, I noted that his impression may have resulted from relating much more closely with white individuals in the gay community, thus making their \"racism\" more apparent. In the greater community, there is greater distance between males and a racist white male may not be placed in a situation where his racism becomes apparent.\n The most troubling aspect of this youth's experiences, however, was that white gay individuals generally had a history of not being appreciated - and even being hated - 'only' because they were different, and they also seemed to have learned nothing from this. These white gay males were, in fact, harming others, as they had been harmed, 'simply' because they were \"different.\" Most troubling was the fact that the gay community was giving its tacit approval to racism by ignoring the issue. Little had therefore been learned from their own lives, except for being much like their abusers, or the ones who gave their tacit approval to such abuses.\n \n Some racist issues were tackled in The Additional Problems of Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Youth of Colour - a chapter from: The Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Factor in the Youth Suicide Problem(1993, 1994). An addition was made in 1998: General White GLB racism in North America, Calgary racism issues. There are now links to Internet Resources related to \"Of Colour\" Issue: North American and International, and the \"racism\" section is in part replicated in Internet Resources on racism in white-dominated GLB communities. I am, however, only one 'white' individual, and I do not decide what will be done about racism in predominantly white gay communities. At best, I can highlight the problem and then let gay communities define themselves in this respect, as they have done.\n \n As I collected information on suicide problems of sexual minority youth, I became alert to the fact that no one was specifically exploring the suicide problems of North American GLB (gay, lesbian, bisexual) youth of colour, but this did not mean relevant data was not available. For example, one study produced data indicating elevated lifetime incidences of suicidality for 137 GB male youth of colour compared to their white counterpart: 40% (10/25) vs 28% (31/112), respectively (Remafedi et al., 1991). A sample of 1,925 adult lesbian taken in the 1980s produced a lifetime suicide attempt incidence of 28% for lesbians of colour compared to an incidence of 16% for white lesbians (Bradford and Ryan, 1988).\n \n White racism is a widely reported to exist in North American gay communities, and the same unsavory attribute also exists in England where gay communities are said to be also intolerant to other human attributes within their group:\n \n As with other minorities within minorities, gay Asians face hostility from their own community and from the gay scene [\"the racist gay scene\"] they turn to for help. Like gay Christians, gay Tories or even gay football supporters, Rajvir faces ignorance whichever way he turns. Makes you feel proud doesn't it? (Article by Chris Morris). [This intolerance and related abuses also applies to \"bisexual\" individuals and, in gay male communities, another hatred(?) seems to be directed at the more feminine gay males: 1, 2, 3.]\n Racism in gay communities is known to affect GB males of colour in a number of ways and, by 1999, it was recognized to likely negatively affect their access to services. A study (in progress) of this gay community attribute is reported on in Current HIV Education Research - A Bulletin for UK Professionals N/A (Issue 7 - Spring 1999: PDF File N/A): Racism and the Gay Community.\n Racism in predominantly white gay / lesbian communities has many faces, the most evident being that almost all GLB organizations will totally ignore white racism - avoid any mention of it (at least publicly) - and certainly not have any relevant information and resources made available on paper or on their web pages. Recently, I contacted two GLB organizations in a large British city - the major organization in the city and the one at a university - about resources which may be available to a male university student from an Asian country who was having homosexuality-related problems. The 'communication' result was that their complete lack of information on white racism, and the lack of related resources, was \"not\" to be given a \"racism\" interpretation, and that such an inference would be met with a refusal to reply to my emails seeking some confirmation that the student in question would not be subjected to racism-related harm if he ventured into contacting these organizations.\n \n An important part of counselling is to NOT refer a homosexually oriented individual - including the ones of colour - to any group where, in addition to existing problems in need of exploration, they would be made to experience additional problems, such as the harm associated with white racism. In this respect, we can imagine such a youth who is depressed - maybe suicidal - because he is having problems with the homosexual part of himself, and that he is also being rejected / abused / harmed by his own family because they now know what was long suspected. In such a case, should a professional in a counselling capacity refer this individual to a predominantly white GLB youth group if it is known that they are part of the reported predominantly white \"racist gay scene\" which generally ignores white racism issues and the related harm being done to others?\n \n For mainstream counsellors, such referrals would likely be unethical, and even more so if the individual was depressed about his racial / ethnic group hating him simply because he was different, thus making realize that little hope in the world can be had given that his own group has learned nothing from what they often complained about<b></b>: being abused / harmed by white people simply because they are different. For such a youth, venturing into predominantly white gay communities could become the straw that broke the camel's back in terms of having hopes for a better world, given that gay people also seem to have learned nothing from having been abused for \"being different.\" Would not, however, university-based GLB groups be different? Maybe not, as Paul reported in 1993:\n \n A gay students' organization provided Paul Fernandez, 28, with his first experience as a gay person of color. A white-dominated group, this organization proved to be an unpleasant situation for Fernandez. \"It was the most painful experience I've had as a gay person.\" he recalls (Diversity, Division, and Racism in Calgary's Gay and Lesbian Community). Paul continues: \"Whites don't have to struggle with internalized racism,\" he says. \"Whites are experts on racism, shouldn't they know it better themselves? Why don't they form their own group and examine their racism?\"\n The citation is from one of two first articles - the other is Liberating Ourselves by Kevin D'Souza - to report on the rampant racism which had not been openly spoken about in Calgary's gay and lesbian community, and there was a fallout from the event. By 1995/96, Kevin and others were leaving Calgary, and Paul was soon to follow. The hope was that, by going to a larger city like Toronto, there would likely be less harm inflicted on them. My response to this, however, was to emphasize that their departure would greatly please the most extreme white racists in Calgary's gay community (and the lesser racists too), meaning here that their wish was to NOT have individuals of colour in the midst, or the fewer the better!\n It is most interesting that the issue of white racism in Calgary's gay and lesbian community has not been tackled in any significant way in gay / lesbian publications since 1993, and the implications are self-evident. With respect to the two articles referenced here, I asked a Vietnamese gay male doing his master's thesis at the University of Calgary to comment on their relevance to the present racism situation in Calgary's gay and lesbian community. His response was that about 90% of what was written still applies, noting here that one could not expect 100% accuracy in such articles written at any time. Furthermore, the editor of the magazine also apologized for problems with the main article, such as quoting interviewed individuals out of context (Letter to Editor and Reply).\n \n It is also amazing that, on the Internet, information exists on racism in predominantly white gay and lesbian communities, but that no one seems to have taken the initiative of collating the relevant information and making it available. A number of \"racism\" reasons may account for this; the motivations of white gay / lesbian individuals are self evident, but why have homosexually oriented individuals of colour have not done this? One answer comes to mind from a conversation I had with Paul Fernandez before he left Calgary. White gay and lesbian community leaders appear to have a number of ways to tell their \"of colour\" counterparts: \"We are the dominant game in town and should you make us look bad by telling the truth about your experiences with our racism, which includes the fact that we ignore such issues, there will be a price to pay.\"\n \n Modern racists (white supremacists?), however, cannot afford to be as honest as their forefathers, and other ways have therefore evolved to maintain their \"supremacy status\" - an expression used by Mistinguette Smith Malone (1997) in - Confronting Racism - Elimination of White Supremacy essential to Coalition, Church, and Society. (Address to the National Gathering (of the UCCL/GC) plenary on July 1, 1997, in Columbus, Ohio. Originally printed in WAVES, the national newsletter of the United Church of Christ Coalition for Lesbian/ Gay/ Bisexual/ Transgender Concerns, September 1997, Vol. XXIV, No. 3.)\n \n I was asked to speak to you today about confronting racism. I want to begin by letting you know that this will not be an opportunity to feel guilty. Confronting racism is work we must do to survive. Feeling guilty is not a good strategy for survival. It is an outstanding way to paralyze change. Your guilt is of no use to me, and ultimately, of no use to you. So I invite you to abandon it as we move forward. Now, we have that out of the way...\n I like to use the phrase white supremacy precisely because folks are uncomfortable with the phrase. Racism is a more polite word, and does not make us think of men wearing white hoods. I will use, and will encourage you to use, this phrase when talking about racism.\n \n White supremacy is a phrase that makes things clear. It keeps us from deceiving ourselves about what the problem is, and whether it is urgent, and whether it is our job to do anything about it. The phrase \"white supremacy\" makes clear with whom we are allied when we are too tired, or too confused, or too guilty, or too ignorant to resist racism.\n \n It is difficult - maybe impossible - for people of colour to win in modern \"white supremacist\" North America (which likely also applies to most of Europe and Australia), and this is a salient part of the documentary Blue Eyed which features Jane Elliott. She learned firsthand about white racism / supremacy via becoming defined as a \"niggar lover\" and then experiencing herself and her family being punished accordingly in both overt and covert ways. This experience sensitized her to the new ways white people have implemented to maintain their supremacy status vis-\u00e0-vis people of colour: \n \n Jane Elliott\n \n Jane Elliott's approach is especially relevant today. It demonstrates irrefutably that even without juridical discrimination, hate speech, lowered expectations and dismissive behaviour can have devastating effects on minority achievement. Black members of the BLUE EYED group forcefully remind whites that they undergo similar stresses, not just for a few hours in a controlled experiment, but every day of their lives. And Elliott points out that sexism, homophobia and ageism work in the same way (Blue Eyed - a Film by Bertram Verhaag). \n A central theme was that, as a rule, with modern white racism, the individual of colour is still set up to lose. Paul Fernandez also understood how this works in white dominated gay and lesbian organizations. For example, to delude others with respect to their white racism, they will use tokenism with two results. The individual of colour will detect their lack of sincerity with respect to equality and leave (which has also included leaving the city of Calgary for some \"of colour\" community leaders), or the individual will fail to \"see\" the dishonesty for reasons related to internalized racism - self-hatred - which produces acceptance by white supremacists given that the individual of colour lives up to white expectations; this includes creating the delusion what white racism is minimal. As Elliott noted in the documentary, in the land of traditional white supremacy, the individual \"of colour\" is placed in a \"lose / lose\" situation - \"you can't win\" - with winning, such as being a token individual in white dominated GLB organizations, being more like \"losing.\" Have predominantly white GLB organizations in North America 'really' been acting in such ways?\n \n Keith Boykin (2000) - the author of Respecting the Soul: Daily Reflections for Black Lesbians and Gays (1999) and One more river to cross :black and gay in America (1996) - describes what the situation has been in the United states in - Same script, different cast: Bridging the gay racial gap: \n \n Keith Boykin: \n For the first time, the Human Rights Campaign is contacting LGBT leaders of color to ask for their help on a new \"landmark diversity initiative.\" It's about time they finally got around to this, but it's still too little, too late. The week before I heard about HRC, I was approached by a board member of GLAAD looking for ways to recruit blacks to its board. \n People of colour have been greatly harmed in predominantly white societies and, from past experiences with the not-so-honest 'good faith' of white GLB community leaders, many are reluctant to accept such 'punishing' invitations. Boykin continues:\n \n So how do white organizations change if people of color don't help them out? In reality, blacks and other people of color have already provided the help, and now the white community needs to do the serious work of paying attention... For many people of color, it's too late in the day for white organizations to expect sympathy. Mandy Carter, a veteran black lesbian progressive activist, says \"the less skeptical side of me would say there needs to be the bridge builders, but my days of bridge building are getting damn near over.\" ...At this stage in the process, the responsibility to educate white people rests squarely with white people, not with people of color.\n Related information and resources have been made available on these web pages and it would be wise to all concerned - and especially white individuals of all sexual orientations in the \"helping\" professions - to begin their education by seriously considering the words of F. Kenneth Freedman in Multicultural Counseling.\n First, racism is a basic and integral part of U.S. life and permeates all aspects of our culture and institutions. Second, Whites are socialized into U.S. society and, therefore, inherit the biases, stereotypes, and racist attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of the society. In other words, all Whites are racist whether knowingly or unknowingly. Third, how Whites perceive themselves as racial beings seems to follow an identifiable sequence that can be called stages. Fourth, the stage of White racial identity development in a cross-cultural encounter (counseling minorities, counselor training, etc.) affects the process and outcome of an interracial relationship. Last, the most desirable stage is the one where the White person not only accepts his/her Whiteness, but defines it in a nondefensive and nonracist manner (Sue and Sue, 1990, p. 113).\n At issue is how to work with clients from different cultural backgrounds, respect their customs and culture, not allow racism and judgments to color the sessions, and still be of help... The flip side of the coin is the \"color-blind\" approach to race relations. For counseling it could spell disaster. Sue and Sue (1990) see race as an integral part of one's identity, and that \"those who advocate a 'color-blind' approach seem to operate under the assumption that 'Black is bad' and that to be different is to be deviant\" (p. 77). My Inupiaq friend is very attuned to the racist overtones in a conversation, and when he raises the issue he is generally met with hostility. I suppose one reason for this might be his presentation. He is generally gentle but can be abrasive. On the other hand, the strength of people's reaction seems to overshoot the intent of the confrontation. My opinion is that the people he confronts generally don't like looking in a mirror and seeing racism. Ironically, they try to be \"color-blind\" missing all the while the beauty of being able to see and appreciate human colors - meaning diversity. A person may or may not identify with their racial heritage, but to deny that it exists (for a person who is culturally different or for a counselor) is burying one's head in the sand.\n Why, however, would the ones in the \"helping\" professions, including teachers, need such an education. Someday, they may encounter a grade-4 boy who is Black and will NOT tell you why he threw himself in front of a car to end his life, as it happened in Calgary. The following are the words of his mother quoted in The Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual Factor in the Youth Suicide Problem - Appendix F:\n \n He was chased home, beaten-up and taunted by groups of other little boys. He was ostracized, and called horrible and vicious names. The friends he did have were mostly little girls, a lot of whom acted as his protectors.\n I always felt so badly for him. He seemed so lonely and unhappy. He used to ask me what he could do to get friends, and make people like him. I of course told him to \"JUST BE YOURSELF, AND EVERYONE WILL LIKE YOU,\" That was the advice my mother gave me. I know now that advice was useless to him at that time. He was thinking to himself \"OH NO, THAT'S THE ONE THING I CAN'T BE.\"\n \n ...My son and I have spent many hours talking about his experiences growing up. They both sadden and anger me. He knew who he was at 7 years-old. His very first crushes were on other little boys. Since he had already been taught heterosexism, he thought there must be something wrong with him even though the crushes he was experiencing felt perfectly natural to him. The idea that something was wrong was continually reinforced by name-calling and harassment from other little boys. The teachers saw it and did nothing to stop it. Everything he saw on television and the media portrayed gay people as either funny or sick in some way. All comments he heard were either negative or nasty, including ones made by members of his own family. He had no positive gay role models to look up to; felt completely alone, and was sure he must be a really bad person.\n \n ...At ten years old, my son started acting differently, became quiet, and lost his sense of humour. His school work suffered, and he talked about not wanting to be around anymore. After jumping out in front of a car that barely missed him, we took him to the Sick Children's Hospital for counselling. He still could not tell anyone what was really wrong. He now says he was really waiting for someone, a counsellor, a teacher, or me, to ask \"THE QUESTION,\" He said if anyone had appeared to understand that a kid could be gay he might have opened up and talked about it. It was as if the issue didn't exist. He managed to convince the counsellors that everything was just fine. They told me I was probably overreacting and maybe he was just doing this for attention!\n \n ...My son was, and still is, a wonderful, handsome, intelligent, kind, funny, loving and talented young man. He has won many awards for his achievements, and was always well thought of by adults. He always tried to do his best to please everyone! He was wonderful, but had difficulty accepting a compliment. His confidence and self-image were so low that he could not believe he had any worth. He had been taught to hate himself. The school system and society in general had failed him since the time he was a small child. It had failed to protect him from the physical and emotional abuse he suffered at the hands of other children. It failed to build his self-esteem by making him feel like a freak. It either ignored that homosexuality existed or taught him that it was abnormal to be one. It made him feel he had to hide himself away with no hope for a life.\n \n There is much to study and learn about GLBT children and adolescents of colour, and their adult counterparts, who may have considered, attempted, or even committed suicide for a number of reasons, possibly including racism they experienced after they ventured into predominantly white GLB communities. Obtaining information about suicide problems for GLBT \"of colour\" individuals, however, has been quite difficult, but some information exists:\n Because gay and lesbian youth in general face extremely high suicide rates, Asian American gay or lesbian youth may be at extra risk. Many will not consider coming out to their families because the cultural stigma is so strong (Asian Cultural Diversity Roundtable, Session 3 N/A: Depression and Suicidal Ideation among Young Asian Americans, April 12, 2000)\n They know that I'm here at UCSB, doing my Ph.D. in sociology... I have heard so many stories of Asian American gays, lesbians and bisexuals who feel left out of Asian American communities, that they become ashamed of being Asian American, or that they commit suicide because they don't know of any other Asian American gays, lesbians or bisexuals (Asian Scope. 1997 N/A: Author only identified as \"gay Pilipino American man.\" (White Print on white)\n ",

The issue seems to come from alot of angles so grow up and deal with the issues being raised by your community. Oh, and foundit; don't ever accuse me of being afraid of taking on an issue in the Gay Rights Forum again.\n \n\n I fail to see how bigotry against GLBT people of color is due to gay people alone, rather than an issue of the bigotry of society as a whole. You have posted two discussions of this and in both cases it appears that persons within the gay community are addressing this and taking responsibility. Neither of these are saying what you say they are. Again, I am not saying that this bigotry does not exist, but I cannot understand how you can assert that the problem is more the problem of the gays than of everyone. \n \n I have said that before and you have not responded. \n Please explain. \n You have ignored my past posts. \n \n I have stated before that this issue is commonly discussed in the gay community. Indeed both your posts to outside material confirm that. I think many gays will admit it is a problem, much like bigotry against race and ethnicity is in general. The largest issue, as both your posts explain, is that GLBT persons of color do not get the support from anyone, most especially their own non-gay community becuase they are gay.\n \n I would not be so stupid as to conclude therefore that heterosexuals alone need to deal with racism. I would conclude we all need to address racism. \n \n Moreover, your suggestion that the solely white portrayal of gays in the straight media to a predominantly non-gay audience is the fault of bigotry of gays simply makes no sense. You failed to address that also the first time I pointed it out to you.\n \n If someone disagrees with you by saying your statements are ludicrous, you don't seem to defend your position but claim you are being attacked personally. That is regrettable. \n \n I look forward to you defending you position rather than whining about how no one likes you.",

Can you not find anything from the last eight years?\n\n \n Sure, how about 2006.\n \n http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2006/76/gaysofcolor.html\n A Different Shade of XXXXX: Race, Sexuality, and Marginalizing by the Marginalized\n \n Shared experiences of oppression rarely lead to sympathy for others who are also marginalized, traumatized, and minimized by the dominant society. Rather, all too miserably, those who should naturally join in fighting discrimination find it more comforting to join their oppressors in oppressing others. As a gay man of color, I see this on a routine basis - whether it be racism in the gay community or homophobia in communities of color.\n Chong-suk Han\n By now, two things are bitterly clear about our \"shared\" American experiences. One, a shared history of oppression rarely leads to coalition building among those who have been systematically denied their rights. More devastatingly, such shared experiences of oppression rarely lead to sympathy for others who are also marginalized, traumatized, and minimized by the dominant society. Rather, all too miserably, those who should naturally join in fighting discrimination find it more comforting to join their oppressors in oppressing others. As a gay man of color, I see this on a routine basis - whether it be racism in the gay community or homophobia in communities of color. And it ###### me off.\n \n \n Psychologists have theories, I'm sure, about why such things happen. But for now, I'm not interested in why it happens. Rather, I'm interested in exposing it, condemning it, shaming it, and stopping it.\n \n Many gay activists want to believe that there aren't issues of racism within the gay community. As members of an oppressed group, they like to think that they are above oppressing others. Yet, looking around any gayborhood, something becomes blatantly clear to those of us on the outside looking in. Within the XXXXX spaces that have sprung up in once neglected and forgotten neighborhoods, inside the slick new storefronts and trendy restaurants, and on magazine covers, gay America has given a whole new meaning to the term \"whitewash.\"\n \n Whiteness in the gay community is everywhere, from what we see, what we experience, and more importantly, what we desire. Media images now popular in television and film such as Will and Grace, My Best Friend's Wedding, In and Out, XXXXX as Folks, XXXXX Eye for the Straight Guy, The L-Word, etc. promote a monolithic image of the \"gay community\" as being overwhelmingly upper-middle class - if not simply rich - and white. Even the most perfunctory glance through gay publications exposes the paucity of non-white gay images. It's almost as if no gay men or women of color exist outside of fantasy cruises to Jamaica, Puerto Rico, or the \"Orient.\" And even there, we apparently only exist to serve the needs of the largely gay white population seeking an \"authentic\" experience of some kind. To the larger gay community, our existence, as gay men and women of color, is merely a footnote, an inconvenient fact that is addressed in the most insignificant and patronizing way. Sometime between Stonewall and Will and Grace, gay leaders, along with the gay press, have decided that the best way to be accepted was to mimic upper middle-class white America.\n \n Sometimes, racism in the gay community takes on a more explicit form aimed at excluding men and women of color from gay institutions. All over the country, gay people of color are routinely asked for multiple forms of I.D. to enter the most basic of gay premises, the gay bars. In the 1980s, the Association of Lesbian and Gay Asians found that multiple carding was widespread throughout the city of San Francisco and the \"Boston Bar Study\" conducted by Men of All Colors Together Boston (MACTB) cited numerous examples of discrimination at gay bars against black men. Rather than a specter of gay whitening practices from the past, the efforts to exclude gay men of color are still in full swing. In 2005, the San Francisco Human Rights Commission found that the San Francisco BadLands, a once popular bar, violated the civil rights of non-white patrons and employees by denying entrance to, and employment at, the bar. Denied access to the gay bars, gay men and women of color often lose the ability to see and socialize with others \"like them\" who also turn to these \"safe\" places for not only their social aspects but their affirming aspects. Isolated incidents might be easily forgotten, but news reports and buzz on various on-line forums expose such practices to be endemic to gay communities.\n \n More importantly, gay men and women of color are routinely denied leadership roles in \"gay\" organizations that purport to speak for \"all of us.\" In a process that Allan B\u00e9rub\u00e9 calls \"mirroring,\" gay organizations come to \"mirror\" mainstream organizations where leadership roles are routinely reserved for white men and a few white women. As such, it is the needs and concerns of a largely middle class gay white community that come to the forefront of what is thought to be a \"gay\" cause. Interjecting race at these community organizations is no easy task. On too many occasions, gay men and women of color have been told not to muddy the waters of the \"primary\" goal by bringing in concerns that might be addressed elsewhere. When mainstream \"gay\" organizations actually address issues of race, gay white men and women continue to set the agenda for what is and is not \"appropriate\" for discussion. Likewise, when \"ethnic\" organizations set the agenda, gay and lesbian issues are nowhere to be found.\n \n The primacy of whiteness in the gay community often manifests as internalized racism. In \"No blacks allowed,\" Keith Boykin argues that \"in a culture that devalues black males and elevates white males,\" black men deal with issues of self-hatred that white men do not. Boykin argues that this racial self-hatred makes gay black men see other gay black men as unsuitable sexual partners and white males as ultimate sexual partners.\n \n \n This desire for white male companionship is not limited just to black men, and neither is racial self hatred. Rather, it seems to be pandemic among many gay men of color. Even the briefest visit to a gay bar betrays the dirty secret that gay men of color don't see each other as potential life partners. Rather, we see each other as competitors for the few white men who might be willing to date someone \"lower\" on the racial hierarchy. We spend our energy and time contributing to the dominance of whiteness while ignoring those who would otherwise be our natural allies. When Asian men tell me that they \"just don't find Asian guys attractive,\" I often wonder what they see when they look in the mirror. How does one reconcile the sexual repulsion to their race with the reflection in the mirror?\n \n Ironically, we strive for the attention of the very same white men who view us as nothing more than an inconvenience. \"No femmes, no fats, and no Asians,\" is a common quote found in many gay personal ads, both in print and in cyberspace. Gay white men routinely tell us that we are lumped with the very least of desirable men within the larger gay community. To many of them, we are reduced to no more than one of many \"characteristics\" that are considered undesirable. Rather than confronting this racism, many of these gay Asian brothers have become apologists for this outlandish racist behavior. We damage ourselves by not only allowing it, but actively participating in it. We excuse their racist behavior because we engage in the same types of behavior. When seeking sexual partners for ourselves, we also exclude \"femmes, fats, and Asians.\" We hope that we are somehow the exception that proves the rule. \"We're not like other Asians,\" we tell ourselves. I'm sure that similar thought go on in other minds, only, \"Asian\" might be replaced with black, Latino, Native American, etc. In our minds, we are always the exceptions.\n \n The rationale we use, largely to fool ourselves, to justify the inability of seeing each other as potential partners and allies, is laughable at best. Many Asian guys have told me that dating other Asians would be like \"dating [their] brother, father, uncle, etc.\" Yet, we never hear white men argue that dating other white men would be like dating their brothers or fathers. This type of logic grants individuality to white men while feeding into the racist stereotype that all of \"us\" are indistinguishable from one another and therefore easily interchangeable.\n \n Some of us rely on tired stereotypes. Boykin writes about the professional gay black man who degrades other black men as being of a \"lower\" social class while thinking nothing of dating blue-collar white men.\n \n If we are invisible in the dominant gay community, perhaps we are doubly so in our own communities of color. If we are a footnote in the gay community, we are an endnote in communities of color - an inconvenient fact that is buried in the back and out of view. We are told, by family and friends, that \"being gay,\" is a white \"problem.\" We are told, early in life, that we must avoid such stigma at all costs. When we try to interject issues of sexuality, we are told that there is precious little time to waste on \"trivial\" needs while we pursue racial justice.\n \n I've seen those who are marginalized use the master's tools in numerous instances, now too legion to list. Citing Leviticus, some people of color who are also members of the clergy have vehemently attacked homosexuality as an \"abomination.\" This is the same Leviticus that tells us that wearing cloth woven of two fabrics and eating pork or shrimp is an \"abomination\" punishable by death. Yet not surprisingly, rarely do Christian fundamentalists picket outside of a Gap or a Red Lobster. If hypocrisy has a border, those yielding Leviticus as their weapon of choice must have crossed it by now. It must be convenient to practice a religion with such disdain that the word of God need only be obeyed when it reinforces one's own hatred and bigotry and completely ignored when it is inconvenient. How else do we explain those who condemn Brokeback Mountain based on their \"religious\" views while, in the same breath, praise Walk the Line, a movie about two adulterous country singers? On purely religious views, doesn't adultery rank higher on the list of \"sins\" than homosexuality? After all, adultery is forbidden by the Ten Commandments while homosexuality is not.\n \n More problematic is that we chose to practice historic amnesia by ignoring the fact that Leviticus was used by slave owners to justify slavery by arguing that God allowed the owning of slaves and selling of daughters. Anti-miscegenation laws, too, were justified using the Bible. In 1965, Virginia trial court judge Leon Bazile sentenced an interethnic couple who were married in Washington, D.C. to a jail term using the Bible as his justification. In his ruling, he wrote, \"Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.\" Scores of others also used the story of Phinehas, who distinguished himself in the eyes of God by murdering an inter-racial couple, thereby preventing a \"plague\" to justify their own bigotry. Have we forgotten that the genocide and removal of Native Americans was also largely justified on biblical grounds?\n \n Have we simply decided to pick and choose the parts of the Bible that reinforce our own prejudices and use it against others in the exact same way that it has been used against us? Have we really gotten this adapt at using the master's tools that he no longer needs to use them himself to keep us all \"in our place\"?\n \n Given the prevalence of negative racial attitudes in the larger gay community and the homophobia in communities of color, gay people of color have to begin building our own identities. For gay people of color to be truly accepted by both the gay community and communities of color, we must form connections with each other first and build strong and lasting coalitions with each other rather than see each other as being competitors for the attention of potential white partners. We must begin confronting whiteness where it stands while simultaneously confronting homophobia. More importantly, we must begin doing this within our own small circle of \"gay people of color.\" We must confront our own internalized racism that continues to put gay white people on a pedestal while devaluing other gays and lesbians of color. Certainly, this is easier said than done. The task at hand seems insurmountable. In Seattle, a group of gay, lesbian, and transgendered social activists from various communities of color have launched the XXXXX People of Color Liberation Project. Through a series of live performances, they plan on telling their own stories to counter the master narratives found within the larger gay community and within communities of color.\n \n Certainly, gay people of color have allies both in the mainstream gay community and in our communities of color. Recently, Kahlil Hassam, a high school student in Seattle won a national ACLU scholarship for opposing prejudice. Hassam, the only Muslim student at University Prep High School, decided to fight for justice after a Muslim speaker made derogatory comments about homosexuals. Despite his own marginalized status as a Muslim American, Hassam confronted the homophobia found within his own community. Examples such as these are scattered throughout the country. Nonetheless, there is much more that allies, both straight and gay, can do to promote social justice. We must see \"gay rights\" and \"civil rights\" as being not exclusive but complimentary. All too often, even those on the left view supporting \"other\" causes as being more about the Niomoellerian fear of having no one left to speak up for us if the time should come. I propose that the motivation to join in \"other\" causes should come not from such fears but from the belief that there are no such \"other\" causes. Rather, as Martin Luther King Jr. reminded us, \"an injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" We must remind ourselves, contrary to what Cannick may want us to believe, social justice is not a zero-sum game. Granting \"rights\" to others do not diminish our rights. Rather, it is the exact opposite. Ensuring that \"rights\" are guaranteed to others ensures that they are guaranteed to us.\n \n Chong-suk Han is currently a doctoral candidate in Social Welfare at the University of Washington and teaches in the Sociology department at Temple University.\n \n Copyright \u00a9 2006 by Chong-suk Han.",

   "I think there is racism in the gay community, just as there is with the straight community. It's a social and cultural issue. The article talks about how black gay men often feel inferior. The reasons are not because they are gay. It obviously stems from slavery and economic and social oppression, whether they are gay or straight. \n \n Non-white gay men are a minority within a minority. I can't imagine how they feel, as a white gay male myself. I do believe that I've had some advantage, generally in society, because I'm white. I don't think we have racial equality. Sometimes racism is very subtle, other times it's certainly not. The racists I've met I would just call losers, whatever their sexual orientation(and I've met gay and straight racists). \n \n It's clear that there are very few representations of gay people and couples, and very little, if any, discussion, and few role models, no gay marriages. There is a saturation of heterosexuals and their issues, and straight people grow up with countless straight role models. Straight people have been able to openly discuss their relationships and things such as inter-racial relationships/marriages. Even so, it's been an uphill battle at times before we've reached the point, now, where there is general social acceptance for things like inter-racial relationships between different-sex couples. Imagine how it would be like if there was the same hush over their relationships, as there is when it comes to gay relationships. Would that not possibly make progress even more difficult? I see very few inter-racial straight couples on TV. I see a lot of wealthy, white, straight people, in the most prominent roles. Why haven't heterosexuals come further, as a community, given all their social advantages? Why can't gay people have the same acceptance and openness? What other hope for positive change is there?",

You didn't suggest straight people, nor Christians, nor hillbillies, end racism whithin their communities before having rights.\n \n \n Hi Jake, In my opening post, what I said is that gays should get their house in order before reshaping our larger Society in their image. I never mentioned \"before having our rights at all.\" That is a misnomer/misconception. I also pointed out that it is ironic/hypocritical that a group that claims to be oppressed, marginalized and discriminated against would treat members of their own community the same way. And since the observation is expressed in the pro-gay sources I have posted, it's an absolutely true statement, so I can't be accused of gay bashing if I'm raising a legitimate issue that is a recognized problem within the gay community itself. \n \n \nTell me why you are attacking the gay community because you see gay people on TV, doing the same things other couples do, if you are not anti-gay? Tell me what any of that has to do with racism.\n\n \n Here's another misconception Jake. I didn't bash the gay community with that you tube clip at all. Moose made a statement of fact in his post that said that the TV shows mentioned in the OP were straight peoples versions of ozzie and harriet style TV that reflected a perceived gay lifestyle. I posted that clip to show that at least one of the examples given is extremely graphic. And maybe that was mild to you, but two men making out full on on that dance floor is shocking to some of us still.\n \n I have also seen nude shower and sex scenes on that show so that Prom scene was mild for that show. All this while confidently saying that i have probably watched a total of one episode in actual viewing time of that show; as I would happen by it and just stop to watch until I became offended. And let me say that just because that discussion with moose was about a gay show; don't think for a minute that i condemn that only, but think nothing of the same version of sexploitation being played out on straight based shows. My community has been very consistent on boycotting Advertisers products, shows and Networks, for shows that we thought were inappropriate for Prime Time TV.\n \n And if you'll note, XXXXX as Folk wasn't one of them because it's on a Pay Cable Station. So be fair and place what I say in proper context before attacking me for my position. That is all I ask.",

Here is why this is such a valid subject which should be discussed openly with concern and sensitivity to those members of your community who feel left behind. Rather than bash me for posting this thread, if the truth was your ultimate social goal, you would thank me for exposing it. It is just more evidence of how you hate to take off the rose colored glasses and look at yourselves honestly. And that it is far preferable to condemn the messenger, than to look at yourselves. \n \n http://www.youth-suicide.com/gay-bisexual/ethnic.htm\n \n Here is the reason for this thread, and all of your obfuscations wont divert that fact. Here's an excerpt from the link above:\n Many professionals have noted that youth belonging to visible minorities need the support of their group to effectively cope with the negative effects of white racism in North America. It has also been recognized, however, that gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth of colour (like their white counterparts) often lack the support of their ethnic or racial groups, and even lack support in their families. For most gay, lesbian, and bisexual children/adolescents of all colours, growing up in their families can be likened to a Jewish youth being raised in a Nazi family, or to an African-American youth being raised by white supremacists. They may not survive the abuse and self-esteem devastation they would be subjected to.\n \n In the last 10 years, gays, lesbians, and bisexuals of colour have been writing more about their adolescent experiences, the rejection they often experienced within their communities and families, or the fear of rejection they believe would be experienced if their homosexual identity was known. They have also reported on their negative experiences when they ventured into racist white dominated North American gay and lesbian communities. The situation has caused some gays of colour to express their feelings about the situation. The message received from their writings and from gay friends of colour has been:\n \n You think you had it bad, and still do? You're only hated because you're gay, but you also have white male privileges - especially when your homosexual orientation isn't known. We are hated and rejected by our own group because we're homosexual. We are discriminated against by whites because of our colour. We are also hated, as you are, by whites because we're gay. And then, in the gay community, we're faced with the overt and/or covert racism of most white gays! A lesbian of colour would add, as some have done, that they are also discriminated against because they are women in this sexist, heterosexist, and racist society.\n In Calgary, for Gay Pride Week 1993, about 400 gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and their supporter gathered in front of City Hall where gay and lesbian community members addressed the crowd. Among the speakers were a gay and a lesbian member from the group of Colour who spoke - in angry terms - about the white racism existing in the gay and lesbian community. Their feelings were heart-felt and it was almost like white gays and lesbians were being told: \"Why are you rejecting and abusing us, as you were also rejected and abused, just for being different? Haven't you learned anything from your experiences?\"\n What you are ignoring by comparing this to white racism is the double whammy that minority gays suffer by being rejected by their own community in addition to being rejected by the larger straight community at large, which I in no way endorse. If I felt any personal guilt from doing that, I wouldn't have posted this issue at all. But I know that I have never rejected or condemned any Gay person. So deal with the issue at hand and consider the feelings of the minority youth who experience what this link exposes.",

   "Hi Jake, In my opening post, what I said is that gays should get their house in order before reshaping our larger Society in their image. I never mentioned \"before having our rights at all.\" That is a misnomer/misconception.\n\n \n You consider gay people having \"your\" rights as reshaping society. Rights are not just for the majority, if that's what you mean by the \"larger society\".\n \n \nI also pointed out that it is ironic/hypocritical that a group that claims to be oppressed, marginalized and discriminated against would treat members of their own community the same way.\n\n \n Perhaps that is because gay people are part of so many different communities, including being gay. Gay people are black, white, Christian, Jewish, atheist, rich, poor, gay, human. It's not surprising that white gay people would have some of the prejudices of other white people.\n \n \nAnd since the observation is expressed in the pro-gay sources I have posted, it's an absolutely true statement, so I can't be accused of gay bashing if I'm raising a legitimate issue that is a recognized problem within the gay community itself.\n\n \n It's not the article that is the problem. It's your further comments which have nothing to do with the issue of racism, and your interpretation of the article, which is suspect.\n \n \nHere's another misconception Jake. I didn't bash the gay community with that you tube clip at all. Moose made a statement of fact in his post that said that the TV shows mentioned in the OP were straight peoples versions of ozzie and harriet style TV that reflected a perceived gay lifestyle. I posted that clip to show that at least one of the examples given is extremely graphic. And maybe that was mild to you, but two men making out full on on that dance floor is shocking to some of us still.\n\n \n That doesn't address moose's issue, really. That isn't shocking to most people---\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVsX9RnoHGk\n \n At any rate, that is your issue. I may find the 700 Club \"shocking\". You use the word shocking to express your dislike. It's the fact that it's homosexuality you dislike. A man and a woman making out on the dance floor wouldn't bother you, because they are not gay. \n \n \nI have also seen nude shower and sex scenes on that show so that Prom scene was mild for that show. All this while confidently saying that i have probably watched a total of one episode in actual viewing time of that show; as I would happen by it and just stop to watch until I became offended.\n\n \n Poor guy. Multiple sex scenes, you've forced yourself to sit through, eh? I'm surprised you've watched as much as you have, considering how you protest.\n \n It's no different than the heterosexual scenes in Six Feet Under or Sex and the City. I thought some of those were pretty good. Obviously shows are rated, and appear at certain viewing times, and not others depending on content. \n \n \nAnd let me say that just because that discussion with moose was about a gay show; don't think for a minute that i condemn that only, but think nothing of the same version of sexploitation being played out on straight based shows. My community has been very consistent on boycotting Advertisers products, shows and Networks, for shows that we thought were inappropriate for Prime Time TV.\n\n \n This is another issue. Something should not be considered inappropriate for the fact that it is gay. If you deemed everything other than a peck on the cheek, equally inappropriate, regardless of it being gay or straight, you would not be anti-gay.\n \n \nAnd if you'll note, XXXXX as Folk wasn't one of them because it's on a Pay Cable Station. So be fair and place what I say in proper context before attacking me for my position. That is all I ask.\n\n \n Ok, so what is your issue with XXXXX as Folk, other than the fact that it's gay?",

   "You guys just go ahead and attack me all you want to. It just exposes the denial you're in regarding very real problems you're doing everything you can to avoid discussing. I'll continue to expose the blatant racism, marginalizing and insensitive discrimination within your community. And based on the amount of online info exposing the issue, this can go on for some time. Here's an excerpt...\n \n The Shirley Q. Liquor Saga: What a Racist Minstrel Show Says About XXXXX Politics (Long)\n Also see Mark's post on Shirley Q. Liquor here.\n \n Charles Knipp is a white gay man who dresses in drag as a black woman, using classical \"blackface\" themes (dark makeup, huge lips, the most offensive and demeaning stereotypes). Knipp's show may be worthy of disdain and outrage, but the response to his show from all sides says some important things about the state of politics in the XXXXX community. While the response from Knipp's defenders is appalling in its naivet\u00e9 and contempt for black suffering, the response from many of his detractors points to major weaknesses in radical XXXXX organizing.\n \n First, let's talk about Knipp's defenders. I have not seen Shirley Q. Liquor live, but I have heard some YouTube clips and, I'm sorry, but Knipp's performance is unequivocally racist and disgusting. I have heard every excuse and rationalization of Knipp's performance his apologists could think of. His defenders say that the show is actually inviting us to \"laugh\" at racist stereotypes (similar to the excuses offered for the Snickers ad campaign). Knipp's defenders also say that his minstrel show is okay because some black people, especially RuPaul, think it's funny. Others argue that because his show has some basis in reality (there actually are black women who are similar to Liquor), that the show should go on.\n \n If the gay community represented the cutting edge of anti-racist politics, and my friends and I had not encountered racism in the gay community so much, I might say that these justifications were wrongheaded, but understandable. If the gay community were mature and sophisticated on race issues, I would say, yes, maybe we can laugh at racial stereotypes. But the gay community does have serious problems with racism, and consequently excuses for Knipp have been made by people who do not live in reality, but would rather see the world through the fantasies of American white supremacist discourse.\n http://queertoday.blogspot.com/2007/02/shirley-q-liquor-saga-what-racist.html",

It's not happening due to gayness or being straight, it's happening because of racism among white people. \n \n \nI absolutely agree; and it costs your community credibility too as you claim to be sensitive to discrimination while simultaneously discriminating against people within your own community.\n\n \n Those people are not discriminating because they are gay, however. They've been influenced by a wider culture of racism towards black people.\n \n \nNo Jake, this was a high school prom.

I don't think it would be unheard of for there to be an age difference of several years, if someone brought a date from outside of school, perhaps. At any rate that's a different issue than your original statement of it being \"two men\". The latter is what I took issue with. I suspect you are conveniently adding this now as a diversion. \n \n My moral compass is just fine, thank you. \n \n \nConsider that we have completely different value systems which guide our lives.

Because I have repeatedly said in probably every single debate I have participated in on this Gay Rights forum that it isn't being gay that is condemned by God or by me at all. I personally feel nothing but love and compassion for all human beings. It is homosexuality, the sexual act that is an abomination before God. God loves all people equally; the adulterer, the murderer, the rapist, the molester, the hypocrite and the homosexual; because we are all sinners who fall short of His Glory. \n \n Not one of us is worthy to stand in His presence, not even one. So it is by grace that we are saved and not by works so that no man can boast that he is worthy while others are not.

But straight people in every protestant church in America are held to a higher standard than the average person on the street. And adulterers and others caught in sins against Gods principles don't flaunt their unbiblical activities when caught, and sue churches for insisting they change or leave. Many times they repent and stop their sinful activities or just quietly go away and continue in their spiritually rebellious lifestyle. \n \n \n\n For me, this isn't about prejudice, hate or bigotry at all. It's about what is right and wrong, and I realize very well that in that regard I am the minority here.\n\n \n \nWhy is it right to treat gay people for being who we are, in a less accepting way then you'd treat heterosexuals for being who they are?

You judge me in my personal life by how I respond on line in a debate forum that is asking for our honest beliefs and opinions. Which I share openly without white washing what my beliefs are. I have posted uncountable numbers of passages from the bible to support why I believe what I do; and rather than understand that i am reflecting Gods moral requirements for all of His children, you accuse me of promoting hate and the condemnation of gay people.\n \n But I understand that because my God has loved me personally, and in a very real way in spite of my personal sins of the flesh, which are many; that He also loves you precisely as you are right this minute. But just like He has with me, \"God will accept you as you are\", but expects you to trust Him with your life so He can remake you in His image, which is perfect. Just as he is trying to accomplish with me and all born again believers. \n \n That is what accepting Jesus is all about Jake. To be more like Him and less like we are in our Natural Fallen State as children of Adam. Salvation is nothing more than the supernatural healing of the human soul, and opens us to being able to respond to the love that God has for all of us. Only those who are born again can hear His voice and feel His presence within us.\n \n 1 Corinthians 15:45\n And so it is written, \"The first man Adam became a living being.\" The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.\n \n But the usual response to such words from me is the accusation that i am just trying to justify my hatred for gays.

I have posted uncountable numbers of passages from the bible to support why I believe what I do; and rather than understand that i am reflecting Gods moral requirements for all of His children, you accuse me of promoting hate and the condemnation of gay people.\n\n And therein lies the problem.\n People like Archie take it upon themselves to \"reflect gods moral requirements\", while they ignore the fact that god NEVER TOLD THEM to do so.\n \n In fact, they ignore NUMEROUS bible passages which tell them not to judge.\n They ignore NUMEROUS bible passages which tell them not to concentrate on the speck in their neighbor's eye while they ignore the beam in their own.\n \n Like Pharisees and Saducees in the New Testament, which Jesus repeatedly rebuked, these modern christians take it upon themselves to beat others up with the law, ignoring jesus's mandates.\n \n \n \nThat is what accepting Jesus is all about Jake. To be more like Him and less like we are in our Natural Fallen State as children of Adam. Salvation is nothing more than the supernatural healing of the human soul, and opens us to being able to respond to the love that God has for all of us. Only those who are born again can hear His voice and feel His presence within us.\n\n I am amused by your claim that you awnt to \"be more like *Him*\", cause you act in ways that he NEVER acted.\n And that's a fact that I suspect will NEVER penetrate your skull.",

You're saying that I judge gays just for being gay, not for their homosexuality, yet I accept straights in spite of their adultery; adding that their adultery and other sins are different issues. Well that just isn't true at all. I completely accept the gay people in my life on all levels of fellowship as equal human beings in all ways. But just as an adulterer would be corrected and reminded of how God condemns, but will forgive the sin, just as He will forgive the homosexual, so must the homosexual repent of, which means turn away from the sin of homosexuality in order to be delivered from it.

I don't ask for ANY discrimination against you based on you being straight or Christian.\n But YOU DO have a problem with me being gay, and you insist that I shouldn't be gay.\n \n To pretend that it is me who has the axe to grind here is self-deceit.\n \n \n \nTell me if you sense any love or concern in his tone, or any desire to find a middle ground in his words.

Indeed, by campaigning against our rights, your group ensures hell in this life, instead of just having faith that God will deal with it after death. I have no interest in getting to know your God. I'd have to be sick. Many of the gay people who are repressing out of guilt are messed up. However, they've been taught and conditioned about these things most or all of their lives. However, I'm happy to say that churches are having increasing difficulty keeping these gay people repressed and in the closet.

What reasons or context was given in New Mexico for a segregated Retirement Community other than segregation itself? So what greater reason would the straight community need other than, they don't want to watch men dressed like the village people coming and going in front of their children?

Now name for me one \"all\" white male heterosexual group that can legally disallow any of those members of other groups from joining. Please remind me of it because I can't think of even one existing. Nor can i think of one wanting to, or trying to exist. I know I have never searched for one. So how do you label the white male the privileged heterosexual majority when we can't even prevent you from joining our clubs? But you can prevent me from joining yours!!! How are we the powerful privileged white heterosexual power base when that is the cold hard reality of the situation? \n \n Beside, you're again derailing the discussion with irrelevant side issues that don't even matter. The point here is discriminatory actions by one group upon another, that claims it is being discriminated against, and the ensuing hypocrisy of such a stance. This thread was started on the premise that the gay community is discriminating against black gays within your own community. This is just another example of that discrimination; only against straight people rather than gay minorities. \n \n And yet you attempt to justify it, make excuses for it, and project the guilt on straights as if we are the cause of your communities discrimination. The epitome of dishonesty, yet you seem completely blind to it or completely unwilling to acknowledge it. Which is it Jake? Denial or blindness to the truth?\n \n But since I'm supposed to be filled with white heterosexual guilt, here's my apology along with peleocrat who will explain our guilt and clarify our need to apologize. \n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SQRezDtxH8&feature=related",

Is Gay Central close enough to home for you to admit you have a real problem that isn't being dealt with by the community at large or its leaders in a serious and committed way?\n SAN FRANCISCO\n Board likely to back Castro bar bias finding\n \n Jason B. Johnson, Chronicle Staff Writer\n Thursday, June 9, 2005\n CLARIFICATION: The following story should have made clear that while the city attorney's office approves the language of city ordinances and contracts and advises its city clients on matters of the law, it does not make independent determinations to uphold or refute reports issued by city departments.\n \n The San Francisco Human Rights Commission's finding in April that the Badlands bar discriminates against African Americans has forged new ties between the city's black and gay communities, which had often found themselves at odds.\n \n City supervisors are expected to pass a resolution Tuesday supporting the commission's finding that bar owner Les Natali tried to ban black patrons and didn't want to hire any African Americans, in violation of anti-discrimination laws.\n \n The rights commission doesn't have the power to levy fines or take punitive action against the Castro district bar because it is not a city contractor. But if the city attorney upholds the commission's findings, the San Francisco Entertainment Commission could revoke Natali's entertainment permit.\n \n Natali and his attorneys have strongly denied charges he referred to African Americans as \"non-Badlands customers\" or tried to keep black people out by requiring them to show multiple forms of identification and by inconsistently applying a dress code and a \"no bag\" rule.\n \n \"These allegations stem from misunderstandings,\" said Natali, who noted Badlands has 17 nonwhite employees on its 40-person staff, including five black workers. \"I never discriminated against anyone of color.\"\n \n Several dozen demonstrators have gathered outside the nightspot to protest each Saturday since the rights commission's finding. The anti-racism group And Castro for All says those pickets will continue until the state revokes Natali's liquor license and the city revokes his entertainment permit.\n \n Natali has demanded the commission withdraw its finding. His attorney, Paul Melbostad, dismissed the Board of Supervisors resolution, which Supervisor Bevan Dufty introduced this week.\n \n \"It's clear to me that this resolution is clearly a result of political intimidation,\" Melbostad said. \"If you went to Badlands at night, you'll find more African Americans inside the bar than you would outside protesting.\"\n \n Natali, who also owns the Detour bar in the Castro, is awaiting state approval of his bid to purchase the Pendulum, a Castro bar that is considered to welcome blacks.\n \n  Several political and community leaders say the allegations against Badlands are symbolic of the alienation blacks have experienced for years in the Castro. \n \n \"In the 30 years I've been here, the rank-and-file white gay leadership has not consistently partnered with the African American community at all,\" said the Rev.

I don't believe there are any viable solutions in segregation.\n \n \n \nBut as he also showed in that video, when a Tennessee community wanted to exclude gays, your militant activists threatened to bring in protesters from all corners of the Nation to fight such exclusionary tactics. Obviously what's good for the goose isn't good for the gander in your opinion, is it Jake. \n\n Actually, what's good for the goose is good for the gander.\n If others want to bring in protestors to fight against that community, that's their right.\n \n \n \nAnd this guy is in no way my Right Wing Idol Jake. In fact I have seen only these two videos of his; and the hypocrisy and double standards they reveal speak volumes about how absolutely contradictory the rights gays demand for themselves and what they will allow for others when they have the power is.\n\n It's funny how you work this.\n You see ONE ISOLATED group of gays acting in one way, and then declare hypocrisy for the ENTIRE GROUP.\n \n By that logic, I can point to the Fred Phelps clan and declare \"hypocrisy\" for all of Christianity in not practicing \"love thy neighbor\". :xbanghead \n \n And for the record, your intention is OBVIOUSLY NOT to try and recruit anybody here.\n You're trying to poke gays in the eye because you're embarrassed.\n Time and time again you PROVE that your real purpose here is a false sense of superiority.\n Cause when you get embarrassed, you cower and leave. You can't take the humility of being exposed or being wrong, so you run.\n And then come back when you think it's safe to avoid the previous encounter.\n \n The admin called you on your bigotry in your statement.\n Are you going to acknowledge THAT archie???",

That is the definition of hypocrisy Jake.\n\n \n Uh-huh. You are taking up the banner of discrimination, taking some moral high ground, here, investing so much time in an issue, but failing to show how it will negatively affect straight people or yourself. You and your ilk do not want to be part of these communities nor gay groups.

Please remind me of it because I can't think of even one existing. Nor can i think of one wanting to, or trying to exist. I know I have never searched for one.

How are we the powerful privileged white heterosexual power base when that is the cold hard reality of the situation?\n\n \n You don't want to join our group.

The point here is discriminatory actions by one group upon another, that claims it is being discriminated against, and the ensuing hypocrisy of such a stance. This thread was started on the premise that the gay community is discriminating against black gays within your own community.\n\n \n Yeah, because some gay white men won't date blacks, and black people are not often in powerful positions. Because it doesn't unfortunately happen like that in the majority communities. I agree it's an injustice, whether gay or straight communities.\n \n \nThis is just another example of that discrimination; only against straight people rather than gay minorities.\n\n \n Grasping at straws. \n \n \nBut since I'm supposed to be filled with white heterosexual guilt, here's my apology along with peleocrat who will explain our guilt and clarify our need to apologize. \n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SQRezDtxH8&feature=related\n\n \n I've never suggested you should feel guilty.

Is Gay Central close enough to home for you to admit you have a real problem that isn't being dealt with by the community at large or its leaders in a serious and committed way?\n SAN FRANCISCO\n Board likely to back Castro bar bias finding\n \n Jason B. Johnson, Chronicle Staff Writer\n Thursday, June 9, 2005\n CLARIFICATION: The following story should have made clear that while the city attorney's office approves the language of city ordinances and contracts and advises its city clients on matters of the law, it does not make independent determinations to uphold or refute reports issued by city departments.\n \n The San Francisco Human Rights Commission's finding in April that the Badlands bar discriminates against African Americans has forged new ties between the city's black and gay communities, which had often found themselves at odds.\n \n City supervisors are expected to pass a resolution Tuesday supporting the commission's finding that bar owner Les Natali tried to ban black patrons and didn't want to hire any African Americans, in violation of anti-discrimination laws.\n \n The rights commission doesn't have the power to levy fines or take punitive action against the Castro district bar because it is not a city contractor. But if the city attorney upholds the commission's findings, the San Francisco Entertainment Commission could revoke Natali's entertainment permit.\n \n Natali and his attorneys have strongly denied charges he referred to African Americans as \"non-Badlands customers\" or tried to keep black people out by requiring them to show multiple forms of identification and by inconsistently applying a dress code and a \"no bag\" rule.\n \n \"These allegations stem from misunderstandings,\" said Natali, who noted Badlands has 17 nonwhite employees on its 40-person staff, including five black workers. \"I never discriminated against anyone of color.\"\n \n Several dozen demonstrators have gathered outside the nightspot to protest each Saturday since the rights commission's finding. The anti-racism group And Castro for All says those pickets will continue until the state revokes Natali's liquor license and the city revokes his entertainment permit.\n \n Natali has demanded the commission withdraw its finding. His attorney, Paul Melbostad, dismissed the Board of Supervisors resolution, which Supervisor Bevan Dufty introduced this week.\n \n \"It's clear to me that this resolution is clearly a result of political intimidation,\" Melbostad said. \"If you went to Badlands at night, you'll find more African Americans inside the bar than you would outside protesting.\"\n \n Natali, who also owns the Detour bar in the Castro, is awaiting state approval of his bid to purchase the Pendulum, a Castro bar that is considered to welcome blacks.\n \n  Several political and community leaders say the allegations against Badlands are symbolic of the alienation blacks have experienced for years in the Castro. \n \n \"In the 30 years I've been here, the rank-and-file white gay leadership has not consistently partnered with the African American community at all,\" said the Rev. Amos Brown, head of the San Francisco chapter of the NAACP. \n \n Brown said he and the Rev. Cecil Williams of Glide Memorial United Methodist Church were brought in to try to mediate the dispute between Natali and gay organizations.\n \n Calvin Gipson, who is black and a former president of the city's Gay Pride Committee, said the straight black community and the gay black community have been offended by the charges surrounding Badlands.\n \n Gipson said he's heard complaints about Badlands dating to 2001 and that he was once harassed inside the bar and accused of stealing a jacket.\n \n \"I moved to San Francisco as a gay man to be free,\" he said. \"I had no idea that I'd experience racism within the gay community.\"\n \n Paul Mooney, one of the founders of And Castro for All, said: \"This is a much larger issue. It's not about one bar.\"\n \n Mooney said his group has drawn the support of Supervisor Sophie Maxwell, the board's only black member, and Supervisor Tom Ammiano. Dufty said he is working with the San Francisco San Francisco Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Community Center and other groups to fund an education campaign for local businesses to fight discrimination.\n \n \"I do think I can create greater affinity with the (two) communities,\" Dufty said.\n \n http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/09/BAGRID5KL71.DTL\n \n Now, I didn't write this article LA, the very bigoted San Francisco Chronicle is the villain here.

   "It appears Human Rights in San Francisco did its job. Good. I haven't seen any outcry against the decision by gay groups. I saw a willingness to work to fight the problem of discrimination. No one denies it's a problem. Racism can happen in overt and even the most subtle ways. I would say this falls into the former category. There is too much of it everywhere, and it should be eliminated, or fought, where it shows its ugly head. Racists do not represent the views of most gay men or lesbians. As foundit I believe said, it's not a reason to deny rights. It's not a reason to show any less respect towards gay people in general.\n \n You're focused only on the negative points in the article, not about how gays have seen this as an opportunity to build bridges between gay and black commuities. Your agenda is to paint gay people in broad, unattractive, brush strokes. There's a very subtle and offensive implication made by yourself, that we as gay people may want to use the Human Rights Commission to protect ourselves from charges of racism, and this is why we may not like its ruling. That's nonsense. Most would support the anti-racism ruling by the San Francisco Human Rights Commission.",

   "\"In the 30 years I've been here, the rank-and-file white gay leadership has not consistently partnered with the African American community at all,\" said the Rev. Amos Brown, head of the San Francisco chapter of the NAACP. By the same token, has the NAACP EVER had ANY partnership with the gay community?\n It seems a little hypocritical for the head of the NAACP to complain about lack of \"consisteny\"...\n \n Brown said he and the Rev. Cecil Williams of Glide Memorial United Methodist Church were brought in to try to mediate the dispute between Natali and gay organizations.\n \n Calvin Gipson, who is black and a former president of the city's Gay Pride Committee, said the straight black community and the gay black community have been offended by the charges surrounding Badlands.You see that Archie?\n Black, and former president of the city's Gay Pride Committee.\n Is there any mention regarding THAT racial inclusion?\n \n Of course not. Just hyping and fixating on the INDIVIDUAL gay owner who practiced bigotry, while ignoring the rest of the community. The majority of which practice inclusion.\n \n And getting back to one of the things that started this thread. The complaint regarding \"gay TV shows\" and how they are predominantly white...\n Archie, WHO the HECK do you think writes, produces, watches, and casts these shows?\n \n Do you think it's just a bunch of gay guys, and straights aren't involved in this process?\n Or are you capable of realizing that it is typically STRAIGHT people who are STILL in charge of the \"gay\" shows.\n Blaming gays for what happens on a gay TV shows makes as much sense as blaming the army for what happens on M.A.S.H. :xbanghead\n\n \n Oh really foundit? The rest of the community is just fine, huh? Beside my inclusion of your quote in the article I posted above, was this quote just below what you posted to minimize the issue as if it was limited to just the Badlands. And if you had just quoted the next sentence about Mr Gipson, he said this; see below:\n Gipson said he's heard complaints about Badlands dating to 2001 and that he was once harassed inside the bar and accused of stealing a jacket.\n \n \"I moved to San Francisco as a gay man to be free,\" he said. \"I had no idea that I'd experience racism within the gay community.\"\n \n Paul Mooney, one of the founders of And Castro for All, said: \"This is a much larger issue. It's not about one bar.\"\n \n So the Badlands in the Castro is being raised as an example of the larger problem in the District. But in no way is the only problem business at all. If that were the case then an organization called \"And Castro For All\" wouldn't have needed to be formed. It's irrational to think that a complete organization would be founded in order to deal with just one problem company within a business community.",

   "Quite frankly, from what I hear about this \"Shirley Q Liquor\", I find the whole issue repugnant. Inexcusably so.\n \n With that said, I think we should be perfectly clear on what the \"support\" for this character is all about.\n From the STATED commentary of SOME individuals, there is support for this character because there is a perception that this act is making fun of the RACISM itself, and not the black community.\n \n Lisa Lampanelli is a stand-up comedian that says comments that sound ridiculously prejudiced. She cracks at EVERYBODY. Whites, blacks, asians, etc, etc. Jews, Christians, ... Straight, gay, ...\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Lampanelli\n Her act is about making fun of the PREJUDICE ITSELF to show how everybody is an object of prejudice. The act doesn't appear to elevate any group, because EVERY group is talked about.\n And I won't deny her stuff is incredibly offensive outside of that context.\n \n With that said, I think some people take \"Shirley Q Liquor's\" act in the same way. But I think people who try to do so are naive, and lacking in a real sensitivity to the reality of these issues.\n Some people take Shirley's act as making fun of the racism itself, and I don't agree.\n \n But at the same time, we must acknowledge that people FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE would NOT be racist.\n Just not realistic.\n \n Suppose that somebody tried to make a skit in Germany that was \"comedically\" mimicking the Holocaust.\n It wouldn't be funny. It's too real, and the memory of the atrocity too recent in the minds of the victims, and the children of the victims.\n And there would be some that would not find it funny, but think of it fondly...\n \n And that is how I see \"Shirley's\" act. I think it's naive to fixate exclusively on the black issue in this manner.\n \n With that said, here are some opinions of other people. Considering there are black people who refute claims of \"racism\" in her act, it would be prudent to take a closer look to see what is exactly going on...\n Entertainer RuPaul has long been a fan and supporter of Knipp. \"Critics who think that Shirley Q. Liquor is offensive are XXXXXX. Listen, I've been discriminated against by everybody in the world: gay people, black people, whatever. I know discrimination, I know racism, I know it very intimately. She's not racist, and if she were, she wouldn't be on my new CD.\"[16] In her blog, RuPaul adds: \"I am very sensitive to issues of racism, sexism and discrimination. I am a gay black man, who started my career as a professional transvestite in Georgia, twenty years ago.\"[17] \n Boston Phoenix journalist Dan Kennedy awarded Boston government official Jerome Smith the dubious Muzzle Award for his part in leading to the cancellation of Knipp's scheduled 2004 Boston performance.[18] \n Writer David Holthouse, of the \"Intelligence Report\" from the Southern Poverty Law Center, has stated \"Knipp is not a white supremacist\" and that Knipp \"invites the audience to sympathise with a single Black mother.\" An in-depth article is due soon in Rolling Stone Magazine. \n The New York Blade criticized GLAAD for condemning Knipp, stating, \"We commend GLAAD for condemning racism, but we question whether the organization's goal is best attained by joining this particular fight.\"[19] \n John Strausbaugh, author of Blackface, Whiteface, Insult & Imitation in American Popular Culture, defends Liquor's act in his book. \n \n Knipp concedes that his performances as Shirley can make people uncomfortable. Knipp has said his show is about \"lancing the boil of institutionized racism\" and that \"treating African Americans as if they have a disease is the real racism\" because black people are \"more than intelligent enough to discern the nuance\" of his performances. He's also said that \"many people thought that Harriet Beecher-Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin was and still is perceived as racist, despite being the probable artistic genesis of emotional support against slavery in the 19th century.\"\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Q._Liquor",

   "I raised this issue foundit, because it's a valid issue I never even knew existed in your community.\n\n EVERY example of racism is valid for criticism.\n \n And your claim of \"never even knew existed\" is ridiculously naive.\n Are you trying to tell me you thought gays were exempt from being racist?\n I would think not.\n \n What SPECIFICALLY did you supposedly learn that you didn't know about previously?\n Was it just specific examples, AFTER YOU WENT HUNTING FOR SPECIFIC GAY PROBLEMS?\n \n \n \nI found it very interesting that this Community that screams blue bloody murder how they are being discriminated against by the larger straight community has a complete segment within their own community that is experiencing the same type of discrimination from within.\n\n Again, I don't know how you can't know some of these facts of life already.\n \n Blacks complain about being discriminated against, yet statistically (and that can be shown) they are more prejudiced against gays.\n i.e. they \"scream blue bloody murder\" over being discriminated, yet they discriminate against gays.\n \n Likewise, Christians complain loudly about being discriminated against.\n Yet they ignore the fact that they discriminate against gays.\n \n What you describe exists for almost ANY issue.\n \n There are black christians who don't like atheists.\n There are Jews who don't like blacks.\n \n I just find it mind-boggling that you think this is actually a sticking point.\n There is nothing unique here.\n \n \n \nI have repeatedly said it isn't a condemnation of all gays everywhere, but you have ignored those pleas and come back with fresh attacks from different angles.\n\n As I said in my last post, you proclaim you are not condemning IN THE VERY SAME SENTENCE that you enact the condemnation.\n Whether you want to admit it or not is irrelevant.\n \n INDIVIDUALS who are bigotted are the problem.\n Their existence means nothing about OTHER PEOPLE AROUND them who are not bigotted.\n Can you agree with that statement?\n Or just avoid that question, cause in your heart you KNOW you want to still employ the trick you deny performing.\n \n \n \nAll attempts at attacking and demonizing me as if raising any type of flaw within your perfect community is evidence of homophobia, bigotry and gay hatred.\n\n Archie, people aren't stupid.\n When you spend 25% of your posts trying to criticize gays, and then pretend that you're not doing what you clearly ARE doing, people can see for themselves.\n \n If you point out the existence of a problem, that's fine.\n But you went BEYOND that, and you don't want to admit to that.\n \n \n \nWell, it's nothing of the kind for me. But neither are you off limits or beyond criticism in any way. Especially since we are all human beings and flawed. If you want your community to be accepted as equal then grow some stones and learn how to look inward at your communities flaws, just as we straights have had to do to correct the historical prejudices that have scarred our historical growth.\n\n 1)Oh for the love of @%#$!\n Archie, you're doing it again.\n \n Grow some brain cells and honesty and FINALLY ADMIT that gays ARE doing what you insist we should do.\n We ARE looking inward.\n That is why we form LGBT groups AGAINST racism.\n \n And yet here you are, asking us to do something we are ALREADY DOING.\n \n Archie.\n Can you respond to your OWN STATEMENT and ADMIT that you just asked that we do something we are ALREADY DOING????\n Of course you can't...\n \n And you will CONTINUE to allege that we are not doing something that we are ALREADY DOING.\n And THAT is why you are assessed as lying.\n THAT is why you are assessed as attacking, because of such dishonest tactics.\n \n 2) \"just as we straights have had to do...\"\n And AGAIN with this garbage.\n Trying to pretend that the advances against racism in the past are credited to the \"straights\", while the contributions of gays are ignored. emoticon_wow \n \n What kills me is that you continue with this garbage, people call you on it and you reply with hyperbole strawman tactics, you deny and obfuscate, and then you REPEAT the same tactics. emoticon_ic",

The gay and lesbian groups are lower down the list, and there are much less of them so this list shows proportions, which gives perspective.\n\n Such gross dishonesty is boring.\n Or is it just a simple incapability to comprehend reality.\n \n Like I pointed out, Martin Luther King Jr had Bayard Rustin as a right-hand man.\n Bayard was gay.\n But YOU would probably label Martin Luther King's movement as \"heterosexual\", wouldn't you.\n IGNORING the participants within the group who are ALSO gay.\n \n To exemplify your flawed thinking, there are ONLY TWO CHRISTIAN groups in your list.\n That must make all the rest atheist, right?\n \n Ergo, Christians must be even more bigotted than I thought cause christians make up 75% of this country, but they are only involved with TWO groups on your list.\n Couple that with the fact that only about 5% of christian churches are integrated...\n Wow.

Here's the link again. http://www.carm.org/diff/1Sam15_2-3.htm This very clearly explain, in proper historical and scriptural context, the events surrounding why God ordered the destruction of the Amalekites. But you just don't like the answer so you angrily reject it out of hand. And that's just fine foundit. So if you'll just paste the other verses you have in google, you'll come up with scriptural explanations like this one for them and get an objective, yet theological answer that you can't attack as you would surely attack any answer I give as prejudicial.\n \n Beside that, God has the absolute right to execute judgment on anyone at anytime, because He is God. And that link explains why He condemned them. And regarding your assertion that God committed genocide; If you planted and raised a rose garden, but found that it was infested with weeds, so you decided to just till it over and be done with it; have you committed genocide? Or as the creator of the Rose Garden, did you do what you had every right to do with it? \n \n So it is with God, the Creator of all that is. He had every right to wipe the Amalekites off the face of the Earth because He knew the threat they posed to the people of Israel. Again, you may not like that, but that's tough, because God is God and you're just one of His creatures so you have no right to question Him regarding any of His judgments. But you can be sure of this foundit; Gods judgments are perfect.\n \n I have spoken of the coming judgment that America is facing because of our iniquity and you are proving just how deserving we are of it with your rebellious and condemning attitude towards the God who holds your very life in His hands. You are showing that you don't appreciate his Grace which He has covered America with for so long, so let's see how you feel when He withdraws His Spirit of Grace from this Country and we implode as a Nation. You will then identify with the Amalekites, and understand first hand what Gods judgment feels like when a complete Nation and World comes under it.\n \n And regarding your accusation that God has somehow changed the OT LAW in this Age of Grace through Jesus? Wrong again. Jesus said:  Mat 5:17 \"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.\n \n So the same moral standards that existed in the OT Age of the Law, still exist in this NT Age of Grace. It's just that the penalty for such sins is no longer Death, but is covered by Grace through the sacrifice Jesus made on the Cross when He died for ALL of our sins. That's why I insist that homosexuals can be saved by Grace just as adulterers can.",

But what it often shows is that a lot of the issues people bring up about Christianity have been dealt with in Christianity already, long ago. Christians themselves already know about these issues. Marcion was a person who lived in the 2nd century who, because he noticed a difference between the 'attitudes' and actions of the God of the OT from the God of the new, came to the conclusion they were different. He started a movement in Christianity generally referred to as Marcionism. However, because Christ Himself gave credence to the God of the OT (and for various other reasons), it didn't fly, ultimately.",

WITHOUT the capability to objectively question it.\n \n 2) Archie, you've already demonstrated that you're unwilling to discuss the first web-site that YOU gave out.\n I'm not about to waste my time looking through the others to find answers I HAVE ALREADY SEEN, and have you avoid discussing them as well.\n \n \n \nBeside that, God has the absolute right to execute judgment on anyone at anytime, because He is God.\n\n Which is exactly what I was summing above.\n It's an ideal akin to \"John owns his dogs. Therefore if he beats them or tortures them, that's his choice and his option.\"\n \n \n \nAnd regarding your assertion that God committed genocide; If you planted and raised a rose garden, but found that it was infested with weeds, so you decided to just till it over and be done with it; have you committed genocide? Or as the creator of the Rose Garden, did you do what you had every right to do with it?\n\n You just compared killing people to killing weeds.\n It is that mentality that allows religious terrorists to have no care about killing their enemy, that they see as weeds.\n You think like a Muslim terrorist, justifying murder and killing of infants in the name of Allah.\n It's just that you use a different name...\n \n \n \nSo it is with God, the Creator of all that is. He had every right to wipe the Amalekites off the face of the Earth because He knew the threat they posed to the people of Israel. Again, you may not like that, but that's tough, because God is God and you're just one of His creatures so you have no right to question Him regarding any of His judgments. But you can be sure of this foundit; Gods judgments are perfect.\n\n Just like the abused wife's insistence that the abusive husband is perfect and loves her.\n You ASSUME a standard you never question, and pretend others are not thinking straight when they don't automatically assume your standard to be true.\n \n \n \nI have spoken of the coming judgment that America is facing because of our iniquity and you are proving just how deserving we are of it with your rebellious and condemning attitude towards the God who holds your very life in His hands. You are showing that you don't appreciate his Grace which He has covered America with for so long, so let's see how you feel when He withdraws His Spirit of Grace from this Country and we implode as a Nation. You will then identify with the Amalekites, and understand first hand what Gods judgment feels like when a complete Nation and World comes under it.\n\n And there it is.\n The ultimate \"Christian\" justification for believing in their God, and refusing to question him.\n PUNISHMENT. Not love.\n \n We should fear his judgment, cause if we don't assume him to be \"loving\", he will show his love by eternally torturing us.\n \n \n \nAnd regarding your accusation that God has somehow changed the OT LAW in this Age of Grace through Jesus? Wrong again. Jesus said:  Mat 5:17 \"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.\n\n You're arguing semantics, and this goes WELL BEYOND just the philosophy of Jesus \"fulfilling\" the law.\n Here's a riddle for you: WHAT was the mechanism in the Old Testament for God's followers to reach heaven?\n \n In the New Testament, all you have to do is believe in God and ask forgiveness of sins, by most dogma interpretation.\n What was required in the Old Testament?\n \n \n \nSo the same moral standards that existed in the OT Age of the Law, still exist in this NT Age of Grace.\n\n Is that so?\n Tell me Archie, do you eat shellfish?\n Do you touch pig-skin?\n The MULTIPLE examples of polygamy in the Old Testament, are you still allowed that?\n Do you care if a farmer plants two different crops in the same field?\n \n These are all \"moral standards that existed in the OT Age of the Law\", which modern Christianity just plain ignores today.\n Don't try to tell me it hasn't changed...",

   "Simple: to give a response to what was already an interruption in this thread and explain why some Christians still take the admonition in Leviticus seriously but not the punishment.\n\n Who the heck was talking about that?\n \n \n \nAnd yet we don't hear of adulteress being stoned. So apparently they aren't being so 'blind' about it after all.\n\n Completely blind? Heck no.\n If they were, we would still have slavery and misogyny.\n But on some issues, like undertaking the challenge to actively evaluate God and his nature, it's typically just blind repetition of what God tells you to think...\n \n \n \nBut you're going to damn them if they do AND damn them if the don't, right?\n\n Why would I \"damn\" anybody if they actually and intelligently evaluated the nature of God based on his actions?\n It may not be convenient by your perspective, but I would not find it \"damning\".\n \n \n \nIf they DO, you're going to condemn them for it (as you should), but if they don't, you'll condemn them on the grounds of being inconsistent or for following a God that seems inconsistent to you. They can't win in your eyes.\n\n Your first \"If they DO\" is too ridiculously vague to even comment on.\n The second assessment is too simplistic.\n ALL humans have inconsistencies. Fathers can tell their kids to keep their rooms clean, but then fail to do so with their own.\n That doesn't mean the standard of \"keeping your room\" clean is bad. It doesn't make the father evil, or mean that the son shouldn't listen to him.\n \n It makes the father FALLIBLE, and quite frankly that is something you can't admit about your god.\n \n \n \nIt's interesting to me that people such as yourself seem to always want to hold the mean 'ol God of the OT up in the faces of Christians and basically say \"see? This is your God! How awful!\" Yet Christians don't generally do those things at all. No one generally does. But then you berate them for being \"blind\" when the fact they aren't doing the things of the OT and are are obviously able to tell that it would be wrong to do so shows they aren't so \"blind\" after all. You can't have it both ways.\n\n Are you freakin' serious?\n I DO give Christianity credit for evolving past the slavery and misogyny in the bible.\n They get credit for that, as INDIVIDUALS. But the BIBLICAL DOGMA does NOT get points for that.\n \n You are inappropriately blurring the lines between an analysis of Christians, an analysis of the dogma, and an analysis of \"god\" himself.\n I think Christians have evolved BEYOND the dogma in some ways. I am simply pointing out that the DOGMA states to do something, demonstrating that CHRISTIANS themselves have some understanding of flaws in the DOGMA.\n \n \n \nBut what it often shows is that a lot of the issues people bring up about Christianity have been dealt with in Christianity already, long ago. Christians themselves already know about these issues.\n\n Somehow, I suspect our evaluation of \"dealt with\" would be different.\n \"Swept under the rug\" may be more accurate.\n \n I don't come from a perspective that automatically believe the bible to be true, so for Christians who inevitably HAVE TO believe the bible is true to \"deal with\" an issue that has this inerrant belief at the very root doesn't make much sense.\n \n \n \nMarcion was a person who lived in the 2nd century who, because he noticed a difference between the 'attitudes' and actions of the God of the OT from the God of the new, came to the conclusion they were different. He started a movement in Christianity generally referred to as Marcionism. However, because Christ Himself gave credence to the God of the OT (and for various other reasons), it didn't fly, ultimately.\n\n And this perfectly exemplifies what I was talking about.\n \n Suppose somebody thinks Jack has a twin, based on the different actions of \"Jack\".\n \"Jack\" is nice.\n The suspected twin \"John\" is not nice.\n \n \"John\" goes out, kills a bunch of people and kids.\n \"Jack\" comes in, saves kittens in trees, gives his seat on the bus to pregnant mothers, and donates half of his salary to starving orphans in Africa.\n Then Jack prominently announces that there is no \"twin\", and the actions of the suspected \"John\" are actually his own.\n In a real world analogy, it would be foolish to just take Jack at his word.\n But Christianity deals with that situation by assuming Jack to be true.",

   "Every single one of these statutes still apply today in pretty much every culture on Earth.\n\n Are you for real?\n Have you even read the book you brandish as a weapon?\n \n Let me remind you of some of those \"statutes\" which do NOT apply today.\n I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some other elements of God's Laws and how to follow them \n \n 1. Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians? \n \n 2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her? (I'm pretty sure she's a virgin). \n \n 3. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is, my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them? \n \n 4. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2.clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should I ask the police to do it? How can I help you here? \n \n 5. A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this? Aren't there 'degrees' of abomination? \n \n 6. Lev.21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle-room here? \n \n 7. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die? \n \n 8. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves? \n \n 9. My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev.19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair, like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev 20:14) I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy considerable expertise in such matters, so I am confident you can help. \n And don't get stuck on the \"put to death\" garbage and look at the ACTUAL RULES involved.\n 1) Slavery IS allowed. You have never even tried to broach this.\n 2) Selling your family into slavery. Oh wait. Is the daughter serving \"Satan\" as well? Is that why it's allowed? Or is it simple misogyny / slavery?\n 3) Animal sacrifice has long since been abandoned.\n 4) All this legislation going after homosexuals, but absolutely none going after those that work on the Sabbaoth. In fact, I don't know of any Christian who follows the dictates as EXPLICITLY laid down in the Old Testament.\n 5) Do you eat shellfish? I got no answer last time I asked.\n 6) Glasses?\n 7) Laws mandating facial hair grooming, also long since abandoned and ignoerd.\n 8) NFL burns in hell!\n 9) Planting two different crops in the same field, outlawed. Yet ignored today.\n \n \n \nNow note from verses 24-30, who God is specifically speaking to. The JEWS whom He is giving the land to as He takes it away from the prior residents whom He is evicting because they practiced these abominations.\n\n More obfuscation.\n You are trying to justify actions against \"sinners\", but ironically you admit ALL people are sinners.\n \n So basically, God evicted sinners so he could give the land to the sinners!",

Anyone dumb enough to stand against the most powerful being in existence is definitely missing a few key parts in the reasoning section of the brain.\n \n \nJust because you're afraid to HONESTLY analyze the nature of the Biblical god doesn't mean that the rest of us are \"ignorant\" for coming to an OBVIOUS conclusion when we do.\n\n \n It isn't about fear at all.

Maybe the southern attitudes are an element of this. \n \n There is something to foundit's comments about how some watching this, Shirley Q., take it as a critique on racism, perhaps with some similarities to gallows humour. However, yes, those who may see it that way are naive. \n \n This act is one manifestation of the racism which takes many forms and appears in a wide variety of venues in gay and straight, white, communities. Your logic is like saying because Colorado has killings by knife, but Idaho has strangulation, Idaho has a bigger problem with murder than Colorado.",
