Attacking them sets back the eventual pro-Western revolution. Furthermore, attacking them just proves to the rest of the world that a nuclear weapon is the ONE thing that will protect you from America, and just as we saw with Dubya's axis of evil speech, more and more dictators will try to obtain nukes and the world gets ever more dangerous.

Some of us actually have lives, and do things outside of this debate board.\n \n \n Well, first of all, I have to go on the record and say that I really don't think this thread belongs in the religion forum. If EZ thinks tacking on the word God somehow makes it a religion discussion, I question his sanity (not that I didn't already). But, until this thread is moved, I will give the response I promised.\n \n First of all, we must take into account that it was the US itself that laid the foundations for their nuclear programme. Around 1957, after a CIA-supported coup, the US established a civil nuclear co-operative programme under the U.S. Atoms for Peace programme, so, if anyone is to blame for all of these fears we seem to have - mainly brought on by paranoid and warmongering Bush, it is us as a nation (just as we were really to blame for the whole \"WMD\" fiasco in Iraq - another example of an irrational fear).\n \n Next we must take into account the need to prove that Iran is actually developing nuclear weapons - something that I believe is rather unlikely.\n \n I believe that they should absolutely be allowed to build and use nuclear power plants. I believe the US should attempt to take a more involved role in it - as obvious child suggested, provide them the help and materials to build the power plants in exchange for receiving the spent fuel. \n \n Also I would say that the UN should be given more power than it has, so that it can actually enforce its sanctions of Iran and other places - I think the US has been rather brutish in their disregard for the UN, something that has led to its low repute among other countries, and that is something that also needs to change if we expect to have any sort of support from other nations. \n \n I also do not think that we should in any respect start yet another war. We've learned the hard way with Iraq at the cost of our soldier's lives. Attacking Iran would also lower our already low reputation among other nations, something that has already been done rather \"wonderfully\" by our present warmongering administration. \n \n As most of the others said, it is better that we be reactive rather than pro-active. \n \n Iran certainly has the right to develop their nuclear power under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. They are on record that they only wish to use their uranium for that purpose, and as there is no proof of their intention or capabilities otherwise, I take them at their word.\n \n As to nuclear weapons, I believe that the US and the other nuclear powers of the world must also stick to the treaty, and not give such weapons to other nations - to do otherwise would be foolish.\n \n Again, the US must become more involved in this, supplying aid to Iran to build power plants, and they should not listen to warmongering people like Bush.\n \n \n Now, EZ, how about your views on what we should do? Or are you going to evade your own question like you do with everyone else's?",

But all it takes for Americans to believe Abinadinajhabs lies is for him to speak them.\n\n \n Wow. What a statement. Talk about complete ignorance of the situation.\n \n Gasoline and heating oil in Iran are cheap because they are heavily subsidized by the governmnet. Oil is Irans biggest export. The vast majority of their national income is derived from oil exports. They cannot afford to burn that oil to produce electricity. Currently NOBODY can really afford to burn oil for electricity. Additionally, Irans oil production has peaked, and they seem to believe that peak oil for the entire world is just around the corner. \n \n The chinese and Iranians have forged trade deals worth roughly $500 billion. The only stumbling block to those deals? Lack of electrical infrastructure. Iran lacks the electrical capacity to support the projects. They HAVE to increase electrical capacity or they loose that investment. NOBODY is building new oil fired power plants. Not with oil running $50-$64 per barrel and that costs projected to rise steadily. \n \n \nAnd the only time an Iranian President is powerless is when he disagrees with the Religious High Council which isn't an issue for this President as he is driven by Apocalyptic visions of grandeur.

So given those facts, doesn't that change the sense of urgency we should have in making sure Iran never completes this program to refine weapons grade plutonium ?\n\n \n No, because you present no facts, just conjecture aand ilogical ramblings. You are talking about, at most, a half dozen nuclear weapons. they could destroy israel with those, but destroy the west with 6 warheads? The odds of that are pretty slim. \n \n Also, iran has no plan that we know of to refine weapons grade plutonium. What we are objecting to is their plant to refine uranium, and we have no proof that they even intend to refine THAT to weapons grade. Every indication is that they are only planning to refine for power purposes. \n \n \nBTW, Israel has just recently approached the USA seeking permission for an air corridor route to Iran.

Nobody can take out their nuke facilities without a ground assault. Bunker busters won't do the job (that was proven pretty conclusively in the recent mess in lebanon). The onbious first response by Iran to an attack (and they have confirmed that this will be their first response) will to be to launch their ballistic missiles at US troops in Iraq and at israel. We do not know for sure how many they have or how accurate they are, but what we DO know is that just a fraction of their arsenal is enough to take out every US base in Iraq, even if they are not especially accurate. Tens of thousands of US deaths is a virtual certainty (the down side to fixed bases). \n \n The US is obviously not willing to sacrifice 40 or 50 thousand of our troops for an ineffective raid on Iran. It looks like israel may well be willing to sacrifice them for us.",

   "Well that's a wide range of views. \n \n Concerning Matthew's remark that because Iran is a sovereign nation, then always leave such nations alone. Would that have included Hitler and Germany in the 1930's too? Obviously, such a remark doesn't make sense in some cases.\n \n Then there's the \"blame America first\" crowd. If anyone is rattling sabres against us or Israel, then America or Israel is first to blame. That too is troublesome, considering Iran is sending military equipment and fighters into Iraq to kill our American soldiers. Same with Syria, covertly. Iran has a long littany of troublesome behavior against Israel, and the U.S. And I'm sure we would be glad to leave the little urchins alone if they would just mind their manners and behave. Instead, they're wearing out scientists building long range missiles. What are those for - to export nuclear energy? Get real.\n \n Then there's the \"Let's give the U.N. more power to impose sanctions.\" Iran is already on record as saying it won't be swayed by sanctions, so that's wishful thinking. Besides that, the U.N. has been a pathetic organization in dealing with any kind of an evil regime, or do 17 or more violated U.N. resolutions against Iraq ring a bell? \n \n Then you have the, \"Well, they're just developing nuclear energy and not nuclear weapons.\" If that's true, then why are the Europeans so steamed that Iran won't let inspectors into to see all their facilities, etc.? Such behavior would certainly seem to indicate something is going on there that Iran doesn't want brought to light. Big red flag.\n \n After that, you have the President of Iran, and other extremist clerics, calling to wipe Israel off the face of the earth. Can Israel afford, after their horrible history, not to take Iran seriously, especially when Iran was largely instrument in supplying arms to anti-Israeli forces in the most recent Israeli / Lebanon war? Is there any question that Iran wants Israel (and even America, the so-called \"Great Satan\") wiped from the map? People need to open their eyes a little wider than what I'm seeing in many of these postings. And there's a lot more that I haven't yet mentioned. In short, the appeasers of evil don't recognize it yet, while many of us in opposition to their views do. \n \n So here's what I would do. If Iran continues to deny U.N. and European inspectors access to their so-called \"peaceful\" nuclear energy program (again, why are they doing that?), I'd do six weeks of the most stringent sanctions that can be passed, followed by a blockade of Iranian ports until they acquiese. If they don't, then either Israel or the U.S. has to take out their nuclear facilities. Period. Personally, I think Israel will do that anyway. They caught a lot of undeserved hell from the left wing when they took out Saddam's reactor, and now a lot of people are glad they did. \n \n Iran is an evil regime. They want, and are already, exporting weapons to extremist terrorists, lately in the recent Israeli war. That apparently counts for nothing with some here. Why? We can't allow them to get nuclear weapons to set the middle east on fire, or give them to their Al Queda pets to do whatever it is they want. And if you don't, then you'll be paying in barrels of blood later instead of just buckets of blood.\n \n The only thing required for evil to triumph is for good men to say and do nothing.",

   "Quote by Obvious Child: Did you miss the lesson in political science class where they taught you that the President of Iran has no power? He's a figure head, just like the past Iranian Presidents who managed to pass a amount of legislation that can be counted on two hands. He can say whatever he wants he doesn't have the power to actually do anything. In fact he's so powerless that support in local elections was eliminated. He cannot even count on moral support from the lowest form of gov't elections. \n \n Ha.\n \n According to Al Jazerra, a pro-militant friend of Iran, \"The new Iranian President is widely viewed as a representative of the country's ultra- conservatives and a close disciple of Supreme Leader Seyed Ali Khamenei.\"\n \n http://www.aljazeera.com/me.asp?service_ID=8893\n \n After finishing high school, Ahmadinejad went to Elm-o Sanaat University in 1975 to study engineering. Soon the whirlwind of Islamic revolution led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini swept him from the classroom to the mosque and he joined a generation of firebrand Islamic fundamentalists dedicated to the cause of an Islamic world revolution.\n \n Student activists in Elm-o Sanaat University at the time of the Iranian revolution were dominated by ultra-conservative Islamic fundamentalists. Ahmadinejad soon became one of their leaders and founded the Islamic Students Association in that university after the fall of the Shah's regime.\n \n In 1979, he became the representative of Elm-o Sanaat students in the Office for Strengthening of Unity Between Universities and Theological Seminaries, which later became known as the OSU. The OSU was set up by Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti, who was at the time Khomeini's top confidant and a key figure in the clerical leadership. Beheshti wanted the OSU to organise Islamist students to counter the rapidly rising influence of the opposition Mojahedin-e Khalq (MeK) among university students.\n \n The OSU played a central role in the seizure of the United States embassy in Tehran in November 1979. Members of the OSU central council, who included Ahmadinejad as well as Ibrahim Asgharzadeh, Mohsen (Mahmoud) Mirdamadi, Mohsen Kadivar, Mohsen Aghajari, and Abbas Abdi, were regularly received by Khomeini himself.\n \n In the early 1980s, Ahmadinejad worked in the \"Internal Security\" department of the IRGC and earned notoriety as a ruthless interrogator and torturer. According to the state-run website Baztab, allies of outgoing President Mohammad Khatami have revealed that Ahmadinejad worked for some time as an executioner in the notorious Evin Prison, where thousands of political prisoners were executed in the bloody purges of the 1980s.\n \n Ahmadinejad's record is typical of the men chosen by Khamenei's entourage to put a new face on the clerical elite's ultra-conservative identity. But beyond the shallow fa\u00e7ade, few doubt that the Islamic Republic under its new President will move with greater speed and determination along the path of radical policies that include more human rights abuses, continuing sponsorship of terrorism, and the drive to obtain nuclear weapons.\n \n http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=2605\n \n Obvious to me is the fact that this butcher (according to the article above) would have no position period, were it not for the underlying support of those currently in power. They could put the little Holocaust denier in a cell, or even the grave, if they didn't have some kind of usefulness for both him and his views.",

Iraq was no more of a threat to the US then Israel is, conventionally that is.\n \n \nSaddam had troops marshaled on the Saudi border after he invaded Kuwait. No wonder they spent more money on their military\n\n \n No, they started their buildup well before Saddam invaded Kuwait. Did you think they magically produced hundreds of M-1 Tanks and batallions of western trained troops backed by squadrons of Apaches when Kuwait was invaded? No. They saw the alleged threat Iraq posed and started a military build up years before Desert Storm. Your ignorance of history is appalling. And as the US showed, Iraq was a paper tiger. Their military crumbled under a coalition assault, proving that their charade of power was nothing more then a charade. the ME is about image. Learn that simple concept.\n \n \nIt wasn't a load of XXXX. Saddam had already used chemical weapons.\n\n \n Show me evidence of a weapons program. Oh wait, you can't because you're Ez. Lack of actual weapons doesn't prove squat. Show me evidence of facilities that turned chemicals into weaponized shells. Show me evidence of workers scarred by chemical accidents. Show me evidence of residue from production at various sites. Find me soldiers with training. You won't not because you can't (that's true as well evne if they did exist), but because those don't exist.\n \n \n\n <flush<\n\n \n That's beyond immature when your logic is disproven.\n \n \n\n The survey group is on record as saying they had evidence Saddam planned on reconstituting it's WMD's at some point. I guess that must have slipped your mind somehow.\n\n \n I plan on taking over the world and enslaving people like you. Why do you invade my apartment? Having ideas and actually doing them are two entirely different matters. \n \n \nOne other thing: Numerous Intel agencies around the world were convinced Saddam had WMD's.\n\n \n Based upon the direct lies Chalabi fed us and the lack of any crediblity from Curveball.

Jim is an old school fascist. If you are an old school fascist, anything that carries the stench of individual freedoms, individual responsibility, justice, pretty much anything that even remotely resembles a free society, seems pretty damn liberal. He has taken this one step further and now claims that the fascist ideaology that he embraces is \"conservative\".\n \n So, in Jims world, fascist=conservative and everything else=liberal. \n \n Jim will tell you I am a fascist because in the past I have advocated seizing all the retirement savings and pension funds that his generation has, including personal retirement savings, putting it all into the SS trust fund so it is back to where it should be, and then sending them a nice note that says \"sorry, you spent your retirement on Minuteman missiles and Los Angeles class submarines....next time control your politicians a little better\". Alternatively we could send them each a small piece of one of those weapons to place on their mantles as discussion pieces so they can actually SEE what they spent their retirement funds on. \n \n I have also advocated rounding his entire generation up and putting them on an island, then giving the island to Al Queda to do with as they please. After all, it is his generation that championed policies that resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of Arabs.

   "Most folks learn by the third grade that diplomacy is only one of a few methods available for resolving conflict. Not liberals... Even a near lethal dose of Viagra won't stand up a liberal faced with conflict.\n \n Liberals and their United Nations are all carrot and no stick! As a result, both remain completely impotent in the arena of international conflict resolution. The examples are endless. They no doubt lead the world in the arena of hot-air, toothless bluster, flip-flops and cut-n-run techniques. But once push comes to shove, as it did on September 11, 2001, they fold like a cheep suit and run for cover like a child behind his mother's skirt.\n \n Of course, liberals claim on the other hand, that conservatives are all stick and no carrot. In some cases, they're right.\n \n Conservatives do not want to negotiate at all with people willing to strap a bomb to the chest of their own 4 year old and send them into a shopping mall to kill innocent civilians. They do not want to negotiate with those who flew commercial airliners into our financial center, our military headquarters and a Pennsylvania field in route to the White House.\n \n Still, liberals remain as committed as ever to the appeasement policies that led to these current threats and challenges. They see no need to change.\n \n Even China and Russia are on board against North Korea now. Though they are late to the party, neither is as late as liberals, who still haven't arrived. North Korea has nukes today as a direct result of Clinton administration appeasement policies during the 90's. Everyone except liberals knows it, and liberals demand that we return to those appeasement policies still today.\n \n Iran remains intent upon having nuclear weapons. Liberals answer to this problem is to just give them the technology, like they did China, so that they won't have to kill us or die themselves, getting it. They haven't thought far enough ahead to ask what happens next...\n \n Iran gave birth to, harbors and supports Islamic Terror organization Hezbollah. But liberals see no connection between Iran and international Islamic terrorism. The Palestinian people elected Islamic Terror organization Hamas as their new \"democratic\" government. But liberals make no connection between the Palestinian people and terrorism. \n \n The Saddam Hussein regime was actively engaged in development of WMD, they had killed thousands of their own people, invaded their neighbors and threatened both the US and our allies on too many occasions to enumerate. They funded the families of suicide bombers in war torn Israel and made attempts to work with known terror organizations including Al Qaeda prior to 9/11. But liberals still see no connection between the Hussein regime and terrorism even now.\n \n North Korea has two primary industries, the counterfeiting of US currency and illegal weapons sales to any buyer with money. They developed nuclear weapons and long range missiles with the help of the Clinton administration and now threaten the Bush administration with those weapons. Again, liberals claim that North Korea provides no real threat to American interests.\n \n Liberals have two very serious character flaws. The first is an almost intense lack of ability to grasp the obvious. The second is, even once they know that their back is to the wall, they would rather surrender than fight. They just don't have the stomach for freedom.\n \n We all know these folks well. We went to school with them. They were the folks with their underwear pulled over their heads. They were the folks that never made the sports team. They were the kids peeking out from behind the teachers skirt on the playground. Nothing has changed for them since then... They're almost lovable, but they are not reliable in a fox hole.\n \n They are older, but no wiser now and no more ready to defend themselves than they were in school. They desire peace more than freedom itself and they will happily relinquish one in exchange for the other to avoid any threat of a fight. \n \n We ran them out of national office in 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004. Now they desperately want to be back in power. They are willing to say anything to regain that illusive power. But they are still not willing to actually do anything.\n \n They are our best talkers. They can nuance their way through even the most complex of issues because talk is what they do best. They can twist or invent facts as needed, on the fly. For a while, it can work. But only until their nuanced position leaves them trapped in a corner. Once trapped in their own web of lies and cowardice, they collapse like a five dollar tent in a tornado.\n \n Their inability to grasp the obvious leads them into that corner every time and once there, once diplomacy has run its course without results, they are out of business. Same goes for their UN.\n \n Today, liberals remain no less committed to their appeasement policies of the past. They remain entirely convinced that Islamic terrorists, and the regimes that breed and support them in the Middle East, can be negotiated with and talked into harmonious peace.\n \n Liberals love and trust the UN, not because it has a track record of resolving international conflicts, it doesn't. They love and trust it because they must. They still need someone to watch over them and internationally speaking, the UN is their nanny of choice.\n \n Nothing has changed for liberals and it isn't going to change any time soon.\n \n jb-williams.com",

   " Yeah, and I really don't understand why warmongers like EZ....\n\n \n As opposed to those infected with terminal appeasement?\n \n \n \n ..... aren't champing at the bit to attack North Korea (who already has nuclear weapons) rather than Iran (who doesn't have nuclear weapons, and as of yet has not been trying to get them - instead they've been trying to get nuclear power). In my view they are extremely hypocritical.\n\n \n With N. Korea you'll stand a pretty good chance of having a nuclear war with China (or don't you recall what happened in the Korean War when they came in unannounced and caused havoc?). China has a ton of nukes and delivery systems to boot. Duh.\n \n You know, I really loved that one comment from that Williams guy I referenced yesterday, which read:\n \n \"Their (the liberal's) inability to grasp the obvious leads them into that corner every time and once there, once diplomacy has run its course without results, they are out of business.\" \n \n In other words, \n \n \"After the appeasing liberals are done with their seemingly endless, hot air wind-jamming sessions at the inept and corrupt U.N.; after clinging desperately to the coat tails of Jacques Chirac and Rosie O'Donnell; after all their Jane Fonda and Cindy Sheehan surrender rallies, and after the bad guys refuse to budge one inch, they're done. Finis. That's all there is from the libs, there isn't any more. Not even a lethal dose of Viagra can get them to stand up now. All they can do is go home, wring their hands, and wait for the WMD's to come crashing down on their naive, utopian fantasyland. \"\n \n I'm also reminded of the John Kerry and the MrWriteLA appeasers, who wouldn't even stand up to Saddam in the first Gulf War. If they had their way then, Saddam would not only still be in control of Kuwait, but probably Saudi Arabia as well. And, of course, I also recall the appeasement liberals protesting against going to war in Afghanistan to root out the Taliban and Al Queda. They'd still be there too, with their little terrorist camps pumping out new bad guys until the cows come home.",

   "Former Iranian Defense Official Talks to Western Intelligence\n \n By Dafna Linzer\n Washington Post Staff Writer\n Thursday, March 8, 2007\n \n A former Iranian deputy defense minister who once commanded the Revolutionary Guard has left his country and is cooperating with Western intelligence agencies, providing information on Hezbollah and Iran's ties to the organization, according to a senior U.S. official.\n \n He lived in Lebanon and, in effect, was the man who built, promoted and founded Hezbollah in those years,\" Igra told Israeli state radio. \"If he has something to give the West, it is in this context of terrorism and Hezbollah's network in Lebanon.\"\n \n The organization, led by Hasan Nasrallah, is believed to have been behind several attacks against U.S., Jewish and Israeli interests worldwide, including the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut that killed 241 Americans, and the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed more than 80 people.\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/07/AR2007030702241_pf.html",

That's what Jesus taught.\n\n \n Once again, you are picking and choosing what Jesus taught. Here's the rest of the story:\n \n Jesus and Judgments:\n \n This same Jesus brings some severe Judgments on one heck of a lot of wicked people in the Book of Revelation. \n \n We aren't privy to divine knowledge of just how many nations God has overthrown since 32 A.D., except we know from what Jesus prophesied that Jerusalem in 70 AD was one of them. Here's the backup for that one:\n \n (Jesus speaking): Luke 21:20 \"When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near. 21 Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city. 22 For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written. 23 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people. 24 They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. \n \n Jesus also is on record with this: Luke 19:41 As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it 42 and said, \"If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace-but now it is hidden from your eyes. 43 The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. 44 They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you.\"\n \n So here's Jesus reiterating the same kind of judgment as we see many times in the OT. And he says it's of God and a divine judgment based on wrongdoing. He also says in Revelation that he will put Jezebel on a \"bed of suffering\" for her (unbiblical) advocation of sexual immorality.\n \n And that's the rest of the story you left out.",

Also, if Hitler had been dealt with before he gained his military strength they wouldn't have had to \"buy time\" later.\n\n \n And who, exactly, would have done this \"deaing with\"? Nobody really had a military. Before he gained the military strength, he had not really done anything WRONG. He was just sitting there in germany pushing disasterous deficit based military spending through to keep their failing economic ship afloat (kind of like Bush is doing now). By the time he actually did anything wrong, he was far too strong for even the combined militaries of all of Europe to take. \n \n Chamberlain got a lot of bad press based on the \"Peace in our time\" deal, but in the real world, if he had not made that agreement England would have been gone in less than a month. At the time they had basically no defenses and no military.\n \n There is some question in my mind as to whether Chamberlain actually believed his own \"peace in our time\" hype. He came home from making the Munich pact and a year later the british had increased output of wartime goods by nearly 700% on the back of a 350% increase in defense spending. For me it is hard to believe that a guy who really believed there was going to be \"peace in our time\" followed that statement up with \"So I need all the guns, bombs, fighters, bombers, and tanks that we can come up with\". It just does not track.\n \n In the real world, appeasement is an age old and respected method for dealing with enemies that you don't want to have to mess with. Paying tribute is a custom that goes back tens of thousands of years and was typically the way that people dealt with nations that they did not agree with, but did not want to fight. \n \n Admittedly Reagan took it to a whole new level when he actually provided military aid to enemies as an appeasement took, but that was just stupidity, something reagan was big on. \n \n It seems like \"appeasement\" anymore has come to mean \"anything less than a full force response at the slightest provocation\".

   "Ronald Reagan on Appeasement\n \n Those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us that they have a utopian solution of peace without victory. They call their policy \"accommodation.\" And they say if we only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy, he will forget his evil ways and learn to love us. All who oppose them are indicted as warmongers. They say we offer simple answers to complex problems. Well, perhaps there is a simple answer--not an easy answer--but simple.\n \n If you and I have the courage to tell our elected officials that we want our national policy based upon what we know in our hearts is morally right. We cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion now in slavery behind the Iron Curtain, \"Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skin, we are willing to make a deal with your slave masters.\" Alexander Hamilton said, \"A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one.\" Let's set the record straight. There is no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there is only one guaranteed way you can have peace--and you can have it in the next second--surrender.\n \n Admittedly there is a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson in history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face--that their policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight and surrender. If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand--the ultimatum. And what then? When Nikita Khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them that we are retreating under the pressure of the Cold War, and someday when the time comes to deliver the ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary because by that time we will have weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically. He believes this because from our side he has heard voices pleading for \"peace at any price\" or \"better Red than dead,\" or as one commentator put it, he would rather \"live on his knees than die on his feet.\" And therein lies the road to war, because those voices don't speak for the rest of us. You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery. If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin--just in the face of this enemy? Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs? Should Christ have refused the cross? Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world? The martyrs of history were not fools, and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Nazis didn't die in vain. Where, then, is the road to peace? Well, it's a simple answer after all.\n \n You and I have the courage to say to our enemies, \"There is a price we will not pay.\" There is a point beyond which they must not advance. \n \n http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/speeches/rendezvous.asp\n \n By the way, Reagan was right in standing up to the evil Soviet Union. The Soviets folded. The liberals were wrong. Peace through strength, not peace through surrender or appeasement. \n \n I do like Hamilton's quote from above also: \"A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one.\" \n \n Don't be a surrender monkey.

It was not an official visit, and he only stayed for a few hours, but he did declare: \"We will stay.\" U.S. Vice President George Bush toured the Marine bombing site on October 26 and said the U.S. \"would not be cowed by terrorists.\"\n \n In retaliation for the attacks, France launched an air strike in the Beqaa Valley against Iranian Revolutionary Guard positions. President Reagan assembled his national security team and planned to target the Sheik Abdullah barracks in Baalbek, Lebanon, which housed Iranian Revolutionary Guards believed to be training Hezbollah fighters.[3] But Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger aborted the mission, reportedly because of his concerns that it would harm U.S. relations with other Arab nations.\n \n Besides a few shellings, there was no serious retaliation for the Beirut bombing from the Americans. In December 1983, U.S. aircraft attacked Syrian targets in Lebanon, but this was in response to Syrian missile attacks on planes, not the barracks bombing.\n \n The Marines were moved offshore where they could not be targeted. On February 7, 1984, President Reagan ordered the Marines to begin withdrawal from Lebanon. This was completed on February 26; the rest of the MNF was withdrawn by April.\n\n \n Actions are louder then words\n \n With 5 months Reagan pulled out and appeased Islamic Terrorism. \n \n I repeat: \n \n I see you won't criticize Reagan for appeasing the islamic terrorists. You should worship me. My prophecies come true.\n \n I said you won't and you didn't despite the clear fact that Reagan appeased the terrorists.",

   "If Reagan was an appeaser, he was a part-time one, as opposed to the full-time appeasers of the mindless extremist liberal left who didn't even want to go save Kuwait in the first Gulf War. And having lived during the time of the events in Lebanon, I don't recall the liberal left wanting to do anything other than get out themselves. At least Reagan went there in the first place! Personally, I think he should have kicked some butt over there but you guys would have never supported that, would you? Not in a million years. In fact, I still recall the leftist appeasers protesting us going into Afghanistan after 9/11 to kick Al Queda's butts. \n \n Reagan Kicks Libya's Butt\n \n After several days of diplomatic talks with European and Arab partners, President Ronald Reagan ordered the strike on Libya on April 14, 1986. F-111 aircraft flying from 48th Tactical Fighter Wing, RAF Lakenheath and 20th Tactical Fighter Wing, RAF Upper Heyford in England, along with A-6, A-7, and F/A-18 planes from the aircraft carriers USS America, USS Coral Sea and USS Saratoga struck five targets at 02:00 on April 15, in the hope that their destruction would send a message and reduce Libya's ability to support and train terrorists. The United States was denied overflight rights by France and Spain as well as the use of European continental bases, forcing the operation to be flown around France and through the Straits of Gibraltar, adding 1,300 miles (2,100 km) each way and requiring multiple aerial refuelings. (wikipedia.com) \n \n Once again, the radical left no doubt would have left Qadaffi alone while he terrorized and killed more and more people. \n \n Also noteworthy is how a few years ago, after watching Bush dismantle the army of Saddam, Libya decided it didn't want it's butt kicked too, and instead voluntarily started dismantling it's nuclear facilities. The radical left again would have never seen that day with their terminal appeasement syndrome. \n \n You should talk.",

   "If Reagan was an appeaser, he was a part-time one, as opposed to the full-time appeasers of the mindless extremist liberal left who didn't even want to go save Kuwait in the first Gulf War.\n\n \n Much like the GOP who criticized Clinton for saving millions of Muslims from being massacred by Christian serbs? Your view of history is quite disturbed. Do you or do you not admit that Reagan appeased Islamic Terrorism?\n \n You keep criticizing me yet I keep predicting true future events. \n \n \nand having lived during the time of the events in Lebanon, I don't recall the liberal left wanting to do anything other than get out themselves. At least Reagan went there in the first place!\n\n \n Apparently the idea of paleoconservative isolantionism is lost on you, but then again, you're not a conservative so I shouldn't expect you to understand much less accept a part of Conservativism as part of your belief system. Did the Founding Fathers not warn us about such engagements? Fallen from from the grace and wisdom of the founder have we. We should have let Israel do what it wanted instead of getting involved in something we clearly were not. \n \n \nPersonally, I think he should have kicked some butt over there but you guys would have never supported that, would you? Not in a million years. In fact, I still recall the leftist appeasers protesting us going into Afghanistan after 9/11 to kick Al Queda's butts.\n\n \n And you have proof I was agaist the Afghanistan invasion? I would ask you to provide evidence of this but I suspect that request will end just like this one\n \n \n\n Once again, the radical left no doubt would have left Qadaffi alone while he terrorized and killed more and more people.\n\n \n He should have been bombed more IMO and we shouldn't have used F-111s in that operation. \n \n \nAlso noteworthy is how a few years ago, after watching Bush dismantle the army of Saddam, Libya decided it didn't want it's butt kicked too, and instead voluntarily started dismantling it's nuclear facilities. The radical left again would have never seen that day with their terminal appeasement syndrome.\n\n \n Bush dismantled the army of Saddam? You must mean Bush Sr. Iraq had little more then a militia when Jr got around to invading. Sr did the damage that Iraq never recovered from. Furthermore Libya offered to give up its weapons program more then a decade ago to the British. And let's just ignore that it was the British who did the talks and without the British it is likely that Libya would have nukes. The US representative was litterally shut out of the talks about the British as he was making demands that was pushing Libya out of the talks. And let's just ignore the status of Libya's economy at the time coupled with the price in hydrocarbons. Qadaffii was no fool. He tried to get out of sanctions more then a decade ago.\n \n \nYou should talk.\n\n \n Read above. If you are aganist appeasement let's see you bash Reagan over his cut and run in Beriut.\n \n But you won't and this will be another of my prophecies about you that will come true. You won't criticize the GOP because you're a anti-conservative.",

We aren't privy to how many nations or cities, etc., apart from the OT, God / Christ has overthrown since 32 A.D., except we know from what Jesus prophesied that Jerusalem in 70 AD was one of them\n \n (Jesus speaking): Luke 21:20 \"When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near. 21 Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city. 22 For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written. 23 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people. 24 They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. \n \n Luke 19:41 As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it 42 and said, \"If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace-but now it is hidden from your eyes. 43 The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. 44 They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you.\"\n \n So here's Jesus reiterating the same kind of divine judgment as we see many times in the OT. And he uses the armies of men (the Romans in the Jerusalem example, and the Babylonians as judgment on the Israelis in the OT) to accomplish his decrees. \n \n Once again, are these things in your Bible? \n \n Next, is the following from Romans 13 in your Bible?\n \n 1Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. 4 For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. \n \n Is that in your Bible, sport?

The principles are clear - in the end if people and nations do evil and don't turn from their wicked ways, then the only response is for justice to be served.\n \n Shadow Pikachu wrote: You likely won't get an answer.

They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you.\"\n \n So here's Jesus reiterating the same kind of divine judgment as we see many times in the OT. And he uses the armies of men (the Romans in the Jerusalem example, and the Babylonians as judgment on the Israelis in the OT) to accomplish his decrees. \n \n Once again, are these things in your Bible? \n \n Next, is the following from Romans 13 in your Bible?\n \n 1Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. 4 For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. \n \n Is that in your Bible, sport? Then why do you want to make God / Christ into some appeaser of evil?? The principles are clear - in the end if people and nations do evil and don't turn from their wicked ways, then the only response is for justice to be served.\n \n Shadow Pikachu wrote: You likely won't get an answer.

Now there is an actual legeslative precedent, with assumed supreme court backing, that supports it. In reality, if you look back at the supreme court ruling that Bush and Co have based their program on, it is very clear that it does NOT fall under that ruling, but Bush and Co are counting on the fact that by denying habeus corpus in lower courts, it will be virtually impossible for the GITMO detainees to get their case in front of the supreme court.",
