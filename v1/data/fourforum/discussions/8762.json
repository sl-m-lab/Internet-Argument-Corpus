   "Nice to see someone in the media (albeit local media) write a positive piece about president Bush. One of the lies that anti-Bushers make that I read sometimes is that he doesn't care about the families of soldiers that are killed, or that he never meets with them.\n \n http://kennebecjournal.mainetoday.com/news/local/3061299.shtml\n \"The president became emotional, Halley said, when she tearfully described the impact her 41-year-old husband's death has had on herself and their two kids, ages 12 and 14, both of whom attended the meeting. \"He wept and hugged me and apologized for my pain,\" Halley said.\n \n Schlegel said his impressions of the president changed in the quarter-hour they spent together.\n \n \"You see a different side in person from what you see in the TV,\" he said. \"Once I met him in person, I was very impressed by his genuineness and sincerity. It wasn't like we were sitting across the table from somebody -- we were three chairs, grouped, and I probably could have reached out and touched him.\"\n \n What Schlegel found most surprising was simply the attention. \"I was impressed that it lasted so long,\" he said. \"It's nice to know that somebody that high up actually appreciates, and can take 15 to 20 minutes out of their schedule, with everything else that's going on in the world, to spend time with a family that was really affected by this.\"",
