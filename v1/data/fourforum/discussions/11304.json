I guess we can at least be happy that this beast didn't carve the cross on his students' arms, exposing them to MRSA or some such infection.\n \nAn outside investigation has found that an Ohio public school teacher taught creationism in his science class and used a device to burn the image of a cross on students' arms.\n \n One family filed a federal lawsuit against Mount Vernon Middle School teacher John Freshwater and the school district last week, saying their child was left with a burn mark for three or four weeks.\n \n The report also says Freshwater was insubordinate in failing to remove a Bible and other religious materials from his classroom.... \"Eighth-graders who were taught by John Freshwater frequently had to be re-taught in high school what they were supposed to have learned in Freshwater's class, according to outside investigators hired by the district,\" Alayna DeMartini reports for The Columbus Dispatch. \"For 11 years, other teachers in the school district and people in the community complained about Freshwater preaching his Christian beliefs in class and slamming scientific theories, a school administrator told investigators.\"...\n\n http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Report_Ohio_teacher_burned_cross_on_0620.html",

If this happened in the UK the teacher would at least be sacked immediately, almost certainly be struck of by the relevant GTC and most likely be prosecuted and never be allowed to work with children or vulnerable adults again.",
