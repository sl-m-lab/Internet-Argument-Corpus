Those adults who were mistreated as a child (and I&#8217;m referring to harsh treatment &#8211; beatings) tend to classify spankings as beatings.\n Children are different. They have different temperaments/characters. Those who are more rebellious require harsher discipline. But, it is the parent&#8217;s responsibility to take the time to teach them in a loving manner, even though it requires them to take a slice out of their busy schedule.\n The answers are not cut and dried &#8211; too many variables.

   "I think there are different variations to spanking. There is one just because you are filled with rage and want to hit them. Then it's not good and it's child abuse. And you shouldn't spank whenever they do something wrong because then you're ruling by fear. They will be so scared of being spanked that they won't do anything that they think they might be spanked. Mainly I think it should only happen when they blatantly disregard what you tell them. For example if I tell my kid not to go into the street and then I turn my back and he's in the street I would spank him. But the intention should be to try to help them, not hurt them. It is best when the parent can say \"it hurt me more than it hurt you\". It needs to be for helping to instill discipline, not just out of blind rage.",

Whether it is socially acceptable or not, some forms of physical discipline is required.\n\n \n \n I agree completely....I think just as some children learn differently ( some by audio, some visual, some by doing) the same is true of discipline. Some children will take the parents word that what they are about to do will hurt/injury/jeopardize them and will stay away from whatever could cause that. Others want to push the enevelope and find out for themselves if what mom/dad said is true. Others take several times to hear, understand and put into action what mom/dad said. \n \n discipline and beating/child abuse are two very differnt things. one is out of love, the other anger/embarrassment. \n \n I also agree with the point that above all, parents need to be educated....too many young parents without a good understanding of parenting and not using the tools that help things along.",
