It IS a philosophy.\n EPICURUS would turn in his grave if he heard someone call his philosophy a Religion, or a Religion based on Science. EPICURIS's beliefs where NOT based on \"Science\", as I mentioned. Again, Science is much more than thought and reason.\n \n Here is a URL for a VERY comprehensive work on the Net, about Epicurus.\n LASTLY, EPICURUS did not believe in \"God\", BY ANY RATIONAL OR REASONABLE DEFINITION OF \"God\", as you and I have just given to be possible REASONABLE DEFINITIONS OF GOD and have been discussing in a series of posts THAT WE JUST FINISHED ON THAT VERY SUBJECT. \n \n I have a section of that work on the net that is strictly concerned with Epicurus and \"God\". Please, DO NOT PULL OUT A SENTENCE AND STOP READING!!!\n \n http://www.iep.utm.edu/http://www.iep.utm.edu/\n \n Section Title: \"The gods\" \n \n Because of its denial of divine providence, Epicureanism was often charged in antiquity with being a godless philosophy, although Epicurus and his followers denied the charge. The main upshot of Epicurean theology is certainly negative, however. Epicurus' mechanistic explanations of natural phenomena are supposed to displace explanations that appeal to the will of the gods. In addition, Epicurus is one of the earliest philosophers we know of to have raised the Problem of Evil, arguing against the notion that the world is under the providential care of a loving deity by pointing out the manifold suffering in the world. Despite this, Epicurus says that there are gods, but these gods are quite different from the popular conception of gods. We have a conception of the gods, says Epicurus, as supremely blessed and happy beings. Troubling oneself about the miseries of the world, or trying to administer the world, would be inconsistent with a life of tranquility, says Epicurus, so the gods have no concern for us. In fact, they are unaware of our existence, and live eternally in the intermundia, the space between the cosmoi. For Epicurus, the gods function mainly as ethical ideals, whose lives we can strive to emulate, but whose wrath we need not fear. Ancient critics thought the Epicurean gods were a thin smoke-screen to hide Epicurus' atheism, and difficulties with a literal interpretation of Epicurus' sayings on the nature of the gods (for instance, it appears inconsistent with Epicurus' atomic theory to hold that any compound body, even a god, could be immortal) have led some scholars to conjecture that Epicurus' 'gods' are thought-constructs, and exist only in human minds as idealizations, i.e., the gods exist, but only as projections of what the most blessed life would be.",

I belong to the second biggest Christian denomination. \n\n \n \n Because your view appears contrary to the official position of your denomination, for example: http://www.oca.org/pages/orth_chri/...Orthodoxy.html:\n \"Orthodoxy has no problem with evolution as a scientific theory, only with evolution -- as some people may view it -- eliminating the need for God as Creator of All.\"\n There again I know very little about the Orthodox church, so this may not be an official website.\n\n \n A few things\n a) we don't have 'an' official web-site.*\n b) Hank's already posted this, so it seems that I've got to respond a second time...\n \n Go down one paragraph\n \"With regard to the \"political tension\" you encounter in the writing of Father Seraphim Rose and his statements about the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, I am unfamiliar with the book to which you refer. However,  I would find it unbelievable to imagine that the hierarchy of ROCOR would have ever issued a statement which claims that Orthodox Christianity believes in Darwinian evolution\"\n http://www.oca.org/pages/orth_chri/q-and-a_old/evolution-and-orthodoxy.html\n \n In my understanding, this clarifies it completely. The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia would not ever state a belief in Darwinian evolution. They might consider the modified evolution you proposed - with God's guiding hand, however that's not science, as you can't prove it.\n \n Thus...\n \"Orthodoxy has no problem with evolution as a scientific theory, only with evolution -- as some people may view it -- eliminating the need for God as Creator of All. \"\n Ibid.\n \n \"This, unlike Darwinism, is not a matter of ideology but, rather, a matter of theology. \"\n Ibid.\n That is, Darwinism is ideology.\n \n If you want to accept that Darwinian Evolution is ideology, then I'd have less problem with it.\n \n Why does the Church have a problem with it? Because it rules God out of the creation.\n \n Next at issue, and this is slightly outside of evolution, is the belief in the literal six days of creation, and of the actual Adam (which bring evolution back in again; if you belief in apes becoming men). These are well discussed by Holy Tradition; the actual event of the six days creation, and the actual historical personage known as Adam.\n \n \n How is it a false dichotomy when one set of ideals (Christianity) deals with the spirit, and the other (evolution) is devoid of it. \n\n \n \n Last time I checked, Income Tax was devoid of the spirit too. Perhaps you refuse to believe in its existence too?\n\n \n Another argument already raised. Income Tax does not mention God, true. But the Bible never accords God a place in the role of performing Income Tax, so it's a poor analogy. God is recognised by the Bible as the Creator. Evolution deals God out of it, or at least suggests that God is not necessary. God is recognised as the creator of an historical Adam. Evolution would baulk that this personage happened; sort of an abiogenesis. Therefore, many topics; how to build a car, run a sweets shop etc, have God no where in it, but God is not accorded by the Bible a direct role in these things. It is different with evolution; as most evolutionists understand it.\n \n Even your notion of Christians who believe that God just started the ball rolling, is not acceptable to Orthodoxy.\n \n \n Most evolutionary theory (except for the minority of Christians that believe in evolution) holds no place for God. \n\n \n \n All scientific theories are concerned with the material world, thus have nothing to do with spirituality or gods. If you think that means they reject spirituality or the gods, then you are sorely mistaken.\n\n \n Yet, they want to accept a theory that downplays God. Orthodoxy believes in a pro-active God.\n \n \nThat God may have been behind evolution, at every stage is, as Lurch would be sure to point out, something untestable, therefore NOTHING TO DO WITH EVOLUTION. \n\n \n \n Its nothing to do with the scientific theory of evolution, true.\n\n \n And therefore it is unacceptable to Orthodoxy as stated above.\n \n \n\"God\" also has nothing to do with the theory of gravity, so perhaps you should revile \"gravityists\" as much as you do \"evolutionists\".\n\n \n See above, re: Income Tax\n \n \nDawkins is even more extreme, believing that religion is absolutely a negative influence on society. \n\n \n \n He is entitled to his opinion, but it is purely his opinion. My personal opinion is that religion is on balance a slight negative influence on society, but it does some good which almost balances out the bad it does. Again that is purely my opinion.\n\n \n However, Dawkins uses evolution as a tool for ridiculing religion; why have a god when you can explain everything without him?\n This is what is why evolution is referred to as ideology; a materialist construct to making atheism more palatable.\n \n \n The Orthodox Church would have said that evolution is the work of God, if it were the work of God. The Bible is quite clear that Adam was created the first man from dust. He was not 'evolved' from ape. If some Christians that you know want to reinterpret the Bible, then so be it, but don't suggest that such interpretation is normative, either in the present age, nor across the life history of the Church. \n\n \n \n Again I awaityour judgement on the legitamacy of the site I quoted, but they clearly disagree with you and suggest that the Church's position is that there is a \"... possibility that the Creator guided a process of physical evolution...\".\n\n \n Yes, but we believe in an actual Adam. Some few Orthodox might believe in a special 'creation' of man's soul into a lucky ape, but this goes against the notion that Adam was created from nothing. Evolution does not state that man came from nothing.\n \n As I mentioned that without Adam, Jesus need not have come. (see below re: Saviour)\n \n Adam is there. Jesus is sometimes referred to as the second Adam. Likewise, Mary is referred to as the second Eve.\n http://www.oca.org/focuseducation/test/sections/studyunits/theotokos/resources/genesis3.asp\n Give a lesson on Mary, but the passage is Genesis!\n \n Christian tradition has maintained other things; Adam caused the Fall of Man by introducing death/sin. Jesus came to us to rectify this, to bring us back to God. Thus the story of Adam, is important to the story of Jesus. Orthodoxy looks to Jesus as the 2nd Adam (in some ways).\n Post 4 of \"Religion and Science\" I wrote (which itself is a reprint of an earlier posting I made)**...\n \"The connexion of Adam to Jesus is always being made in Christianity. \n Irenaeus (Bishop of Lyons c.177-200) says \"in the first Adam we offended God by not performing his command; in the second Adam* we have been reconciled, becoming 'obedient unto death'. Adversus Haereses v.xvi.3 \n Fellowship with God is light and life...separation from God is death.\" Ibid v.xxvii.2 \n Right down to our own day... \n \"A knowledge of the beginning and end of all things is essential for us to understand the purpose of our existence here on this earth, and what lies beyond it\" Fr.Seraphim Rose's commentary on St. Symeon The New Theologian's \"The First-Created Man.\" \n To undermine Genesis is to undermine Jesus. \n \n *The Second Adam is Jesus. And it is a literal Adam they talk of.\n Thus the position of Adam is crucial if Christians are to understand why Jesus came.\n But, it can't be made more clear than... \n \"No one should think that the Creation of Six Days is allegory...\" St. Ephraim the Syrian (quoted in Fr. Seraphim Rose, \"Genesis, Creation and Early Man: The Orthodox Christian Vision p86).\"\n (the late Fr Seraphim Rose is the author mentioned on the site you cited and he's a highly respected contemporary Orthodox theologian).\n \n \nFurther, I've asked various evolution-Christians (there's not a real term for this group), on this and other fora, to explain their ideas with regards to why God chose a lucky-ape, to invest with a soul. \n\n \n \nAnd? did they answer?\n G.\n\n \n No. I've asked many a time. Not one. Not a sausage. Shamefully no. But then, it's because they have to re-interpret the Bible to get around that...as quite clearly Jesus is our Saviour (in Christian thought the notion comes from 2,000 years of tradition and is based also on Scripture)\n Jesus came to redeem us. To save us.\n Luke 2:11\n Today in the town of David a Saviour has been born to you; he is Christ[ 2:11 Or Messiah. \"The Christ\" (Greek) and \"the Messiah\" (Hebrew) both mean \"the Anointed One\"; also in verse 26.] the Lord. \n John 4:42\n They said to the woman, \"We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Saviour of the world.\" \n Ephesians 5:23\n For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Saviour. \n NB all Biblical quotes unless otherwise cited are from www.biblegateway.com and are from the New International Version of the Bible.\n \n Thus the dialectic relationship between Jesus and Adam is a core Christian belief.\n \n \n \n *A note on Orthodoxy. There are many things that are open to debate in our church, because we don't have a 'pope' who can just say \"This is what we believe in.... no more discussion\".\n \n However, debating something, and saying that we should believe it, are also separate issues. All Orthodox should, as we're the religion of tradition, look to the teachings of Holy Tradition. St. Symeon is but one writer who has stated that Genesis is true. St. Basil the Great, St. Ambrose of Milan, St. Augustine of Hippo, etc have all commented on it.\n \n If I could repeat what St. Ephraim the Syrian says\n \"No one should think that the Creation of Six Days is an allegory...\" \n quoted p86 \"Genesis, Creation and Early Man: The Orthodox Christian Vision\" by Fr Seraphim Rose\n \n We are a church that holds to tradition. As I said earlier, we are the second biggest. I'm sure you'll find Orthodox who've lost faith, but I still believe the term 'minority view' is inaccurate; though I don't have the stats that you love to back that one up. :)",
