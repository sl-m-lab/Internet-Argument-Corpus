   "Another \"sacral victim\" to greed of financial oligarchs was sacrificed in February in Kazakhstan. This time it was cochair of the opposition party former statesman Altynbek Sarsenbaev who was murdered together with his personal bodyguard and driver. As a result a row of high-ranked officials are arrested and even Kazakh president Nazarbaev's family is discredited. That's a kind of revenge for Nazarbaev's attempts to get rid of his dependence from Jewish oligarch Berezovsky's minion Mashkevich. Now political crisis threats to the country and Kazakh president is obliged to ask for help Mashkevich and to redouble his dependence.\n Sarsenbaev was quite odious figure and disputed against Kazakh Russian relations' development. Thus there is version of Russian Special Forces connection with his murder. That's typical for Berezovsky's \"operations\" for he has grudge against Russia. He had been controlling successfully Eltsyn's policy but had failed to establish his power over Putin. And to that time he had too long list of crimes committed in Russia. So he had to seek asylum in Europe. So Mashkevich kills two birds with one stone: puts Nazarbaev on his place and quarrels Kazakhstan with Russia (and owing to Berezovsky's pains it's already at daggers drawn with Ukraine and Georgia and Baltic states).\n Thus Berezovsky looks like big spider wrapping by his nets all countries of post Soviet territory and even in Europe. His minions are everywhere and they descend to the most dirty tricks and gravest crimes for their gaining of super-profits. They're racketing and black-mailing and kidnapping and murdering not only common citizens but also high and mighty. And their influence grows. We should stop it.",
