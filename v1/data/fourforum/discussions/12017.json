   "Now it's CitiCorp. Or CitiGroup. Whatever name under which it operates.\n \n And, who is being bailed out?\n \n A filthy rich Saudi Prince, Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who increased his stake to 5 percent from less than 4 percent, because he's got the billions of bucks to do so.\n \n And the bill is being passed onto me and I'd bet that my assets are less than one-one hundredth of one percent of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's assets, but I get to pay the bill to save Talal's groats.\n \n Isn't capitalism wonderful?\n \n Especially when it's Republican non-regulated capitalism?\n \n I get to pay the bills of a corrupt prince from a corrupt country where women can't vote, they can't drive cars and they, the women, have to go around completely covered in shrouds that even mask their faces.\n \n Thank you, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, very good friends of the prince who comes from the country that financed the September 11, 2001 savage attacks on my nation.\n \n Thank you! Thank you!",

   "Actually, your children and/or inflation is footing the bill. Furthermore, it was the democrats who really wanted the bailout bill. But no need to point the finger because I don't have enough for all the parties to blame (yes the republicans are included). \n \n Simone, \n \n You want to be an honest citizen and figure out who is to blame? Check who you US rep is and your 2 senators. Find out if they voted for the bailout. If they did than vote against them next chance you get no matter who is running against them...unless that person supports the bailouts too. You are going to be better off with a US representative that can't spell than one who voted for a $700 billion bailout. \n \n Oh, and when this \"stimulus\" package goes up to a vote, I suggest you tell your congressman that you will burn his or her house down if he or she votes for it. You can then show them a list of the dozen or so \"bailouts\" Japan did during the 90s that sunk their economy.",

   "These bailouts have gotten absolutely insane.\n \n As of today, the US government has either purchased, accepted as collateral, or provided 100% face value guarantees (for all intents and purposes that is the exact same as accepting them as collateral at face value) over $7 TRILLION in securities that are SO toxic that IF you can find somebody dumb enough to buy them, they sell for pennies on the dollar. \n \n All the while treasury officials are whispering to the press that if we ever actually have to HONOR any of those guarantees (which we can say 100% they will at some point), we are in big trouble because they are not actually any good because they do not think that teh government could raise the money in a timely manner to actually honor them.",

   "\n Isn't capitalism wonderful?\n \n Especially when it's Republican non-regulated capitalism?\n \n\n \n Beg pardon, but this is not Capitalism. This is corporate socialism. In a fully capitalist system, these companies would be allowed to fail so that resources can be devoted to solvent, successful firms. The losers would be those who bought stock in the banks that failed. \n \n Neocon capitalism, perhaps, but certainly not unregulated free market.\n \n One of the funniest (from a macabre angle) issues in this whole debate is that the harshest criticism of the bailouts comes from the ends of the economic spectrum (conservatives calling foul on more government meddling and liberals angry at favors being done for big corporations). We must learn to label this correctly. It is not free-market capitalism run amok. It is not socialism. It is a hideous bastard with the worst features of both and the advantages of neither. Truly, this is a bipartisan screwup.",
