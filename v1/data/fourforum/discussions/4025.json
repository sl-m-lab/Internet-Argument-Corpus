   "If a fertilised egg was legally a person and abortion murder...\n \n 1)Clearly, every miscarriage would have to be investigated as murder. An internal examination would need to be carried out in the presence of a police officer as soon as the woman arrived at hospital. If the woman was found to have endangered her fetus in any way (drinking, having sex - oh hang on, we'd better make pregnant woman doing this illegal as it can cause a miscarriage) then she will be charged. Didn't know she was pregnant? That's no excuse! MURDERER!\n \n 2) if no proof of intent was found, then a miscarriage would also have to be investigated for manslaughter. If say, a woman fell down the stairs and caused a miscarriage then she would have to be tried and sentenced for accidental killing/manslaughter or similar. Just as when you drive you are liable if you kill somebody, you must be liable when you cause the death of the beloved fetus. Naturally pregnant women seen wearing high heels or tight jeans will be hauled in and charged with fetal endangerment -they're trying to induce a miscarriage! MURDERER!\n \n 3) Now as women will still self abort (for they can be EVIL like that) they will not be able to go to the ER and get treatment, meaning they'll bleed to death at home. That's great - saves us bothering to execute them for their heinous crime.\n \n 4) Clearly emergency contraception would be banned and as vitamin C can cause implantation failure well, that would have to be banned too. Or perhaps it would be simpler to forbid women to buy vitamin C tablets, or indeed oranges. Their men can get it for them though, so better make anything containing a significant amount of vitamin c illegal. There'll be a scurvy epidemic of course but that's better than MURDER!!\n \n 5) Not only would e/c be banned but as the IUD, pill and well, pretty much all non-barrier methods can cause implantation failure they would be banned. Yes it's a shame for all women who rely on the pill etc for health reasons but hey. Now of course as the only b/c left (barrier methods, NFP and spermicide) are the least effective method of b/c there will be more unplanned pregnancies. And of course an increased number of rape and incest pregnancies (can't have the rape victims MURDERING their offspring with e/c!) and conceivably an increase in rapes as abusive men seek to impregnate their victims, but hey, what ya gonna do? Far better than a woman is brutally raped than a fertilised egg fails to implant!\n \n 6) But wait, abortion can happen in so many ways! All herbs that can cause an abortion must be banned and so must acupuncture which can also cause MURDER! What a shame that so many people will have this avenue of treatment shut down for them. Obviously RU486 willlbe forbidden but there's the pesky internet to deal with...impossible to shut down these sites selling the drug and impossible to stop all the drugs coming into this country (heck, walk round a college dorm and we'll see what a great job we do stopping cannabis getting into the country) so to prevent \"murder\" it's best to stop women using the internet. Or indeed men. Better ban it altogether! \n \n 7)Hmmmm, legally the woman can travel to another country to abort...better make a law against that one too. But how are we going to check? A woman could not tell anyone she's pregnant and hop over to Canada, so I suggest that all women who travel are subjected to pregnancy tests when they leave and when they come back. Or perhaps we could just forbid women to travel if they're pregnant: need life saving surgery in another country? No! Need to travel on business? Noo! Fathers funeral? Noooo! You might be planning to MURDER!\n \n 8) Hmm major problem...as nobody knows of the fertilised eggs existence (unlike a born person who is fully registered) and it's not even visible to the human eye, we're going to have problems with women aborting and nobody knowing. Best that all women are pregnancy tested every fortnight - no, better make that every week - and then fully quizzed to make sure they plan no harm. \n \n Oh but hang on, a pregnancy test doesn't work in the first month...well this is a conundrum. She could MURDER the fertilised egg after conception and no-one would know! Best that all women hand in their sanitary towels for full inspection to check there's not a poor murdered fertilised egg in there. Any woman who claims to have no pad to hand in due to a late period or irregular cycle will be fully investigated by police and doctor and as a minimum of 2/3 of eggs fail to implant we're going to have a lot of potential murders to investigate. Any woman who doesn't look suitably distressed at her beloved babies death (they'll claim not to know there was a fertilised egg there of course, but that's no excuse) will instantly be swept off for questioning.\n \n 9) Lordy me, there are so many things that can harm a beloved sacred fetus...pregnant women must be forbidden to drink or smoke obviously, and must stick to a healthy diet (naturally failure to take prenatal vitamins will be punished). But what about pollution? Any woman who walks beside a road or indeed, gets too close to a car will be prosecuted. Need to get to work? Tchah! That could be MURDER! In fact, lets ship all pregnant women to the middle of the countryside where they can be supervised to make sure they're behaving properly. Oh but hang on...a woman could be pregnant and we wouldn't know it - best to ship off all women just in case. \n \n 10) We'll have to have an overhall of the social security system as obviously, a shnoogy little fertilised egg can get welfare. We'll have to overhall the way we register births and deaths, not to mention the increased amount of funerals for this *sniff* poor little zefs. Then we'll have to re-write the constitution and laws to remove that silly little part about \"born persons\" and any mention of (snigger) bodily autonomy.\n \n Talking of which, as forced organ donation is now law, everybody get ready to donate your kidneys, blood, corneas etc! wait a minute, what's that I hear about not wanting to harm yourself donating your bodily resources? Hypocrite and MURDERER!! look forward to the news titles \"...and today a man was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment for causing another mans blindness through refusal to donate a cornea...\" Nah, something tells me forced organ donation will magically only apply to pregnancy meaning that women officially now have less rights than men. Well, the womens lib thing was overrated anyway and lets face it, and the extreme right wing fundies will be happy so it evens out nicely.\n \n What am I talking about? This is insane! Where will the money come from? This pregnancy policing would cripple the country, not to mention the welfare for fertilised eggs who are after all people... better to make sex legal only for procreation. If a couple intend to procreate they will get a special sex license and be allowed to breed. Of course this means that marriages can't be consummated for years, or that couples who don't want children can never have sex but well, that's better than MURDER!! They can either have full sterilisation (better make it a full hysterectomy and leave nothing in there, just to be on the safe side) or wait until after the menopause. To make sure this law is followed we can have weekly virginity tests for the women. Any woman found to have had non-procreational sex will be charged immediately. Of course we won't charge rape victims, but they will need to prove rape and as at the moment we have a 7% conviction rate (and no real way to improve it) that means 93% of women charged will be innocent but hey, who cares? The well being of a woman pales in comparison to a non-sentient blob of cells WHO MUST BE PROTECTED AT ALL COSTS.\n \n PLEASE HELP MAKE THIS LAW! Campaign! Donate! Campaigning starts at home - lock up your women and make sure they don't eat oranges or wear high heels - remember, they are now officially second class citizens and don't deserve the same rights as men! They can carry sacred fertilised eggs so must be treated like the walking wombs they are! Remember: she is not a woman, she is an incubator and must be treated like that throughout her fertile life.\n \n There you go Max. That one's for you.",

That is very very disturbing to hear. I also believe it to be a rare incidance. We are trained to make sure the first question we ask after \"How are you today?\" is \"Are you sure you want to have an abortion?\" If the women even sounds a little unsure we will not proceed to make her an apointment.\n \n There is a standard form that each woman fills out asking her her comfort level with her disision and wether she would like information on adoption or parenting and if you check yes then your concilor is responsible to give you that infromation. It is also coustmary for your councilor to speak to you alone with out your boyfriend to be sure that this is your choice and not his. \n \n Also, in most states you must sign a concent in front of the Dr. before she/he begins the abortion stating that you know you can change your mind at any time before they begin and that you choose abortion of your own will. The Dr. will also again ask you if you are sure of your choice and if you are not they will not proceed. In most places this is state law. If these measures were not taken for you then even if it has been years you should complain to the CEO for your PP affiliate. I know they would want to here about it.\n \n In almost all cases PP's that provide abortion services actuallly LOOSE money doing so. They continue to provide service becuase they believe in a womans right to choose but many affiliates simply cannot affored to do abortions and so they only do GYN care and contraception. If you were thinking that PP wanted your money and that was why they did not give you these options I find that unlikely. However as I said if they failed to provide the best options counciling avilable to you they should know about it so the same dose not happen to someone else.\n \n If you truly feel that you were forced to have an abortion by your boyfriend or Planned Parenthood then you need to report the crime against you because that it abuse and those responsible need to be held accountable. Otherwise if you are just sorry for your disicion now, then you are not a victim, you are regreatable and remorseful. Ethier way that is a terrible expiriance but if you are turely pro-women then I urdge you to take responibility for your choice. To do otherwie is taking away from your own ability to feel responible for your own actions and that takes personal power away from you. Even if you would not do the same today.\n \n As for my sarcasm please take it as just that. Sarcasm. ",

   "Please outline how it's screwed up.\n\n \n Allow me to interject here: First, I am not saying I support abortion or don't support abortion, I am simply speaking about how the logic is screwed up because it most definitely is.\n \n Your first point begs the question. The remainder are hasty generalizations.\n \n 1)There would be no need to have a police officer present for every miscarriage. Reports from doctors would come only when they believed that the mother had done something illegal. This is true of mandatory reporting of child abuse. Situation no different. We don't have a police officer present each time a child shows up in the ER with an injury.\n \n 2) see number one as point number two in the original post is based entirely on point number one.\n \n 3) The police have mandatory reporting for other criminal problems such as gun shots and knife wounds. Criminal activity is criminal activity and should be reported, if you are not engaged in criminal activity (doing something wrong) then there is no reason to hide. She has a choice to seek medical attention and accept responsibility for her behavior and fight the law through legal means or accept the responsibility of preferring criminal activity to health.\n \n 4) The logical fallacy here is non-sequitor. Contraception is prior to conception. Emergency contraception is just a fancy name for abortion. You also equivocate the meaning of those words. If people were responsible and engaged in contraception in the first place....As for rape (occurs much less frequently than simple irresponsible behavior) you have stated nothing to prove or show that pregnancy and delivery would kill the individual involved (assumes facts not in evidence)\n \n 5) see number four as it relies on number four.\n \n 6)NOt even sure where this one comes from. It is totally irrelevant. Laws providing penalty for criminal behavior are not intended to prevent the behavior but to punish it. It is hoped that fear of punishment will have an effect, but it does not control people Therefore the following points 7-10 are all based on the idea that we are trying to prevent murder.

I don't think she meant to be taken litearaly.\n \n But I find some flaws here in your retort I would like to piont out.\n \n \n 4) The logical fallacy here is non-sequitor. Contraception is prior to conception. Emergency contraception is just a fancy name for abortion.\n [B]\n Point 1; Emerancy contraception is in no way an abortion. It's primary action is to create an enviorment incondusive to implantation of a fertilized zygote with in the uterus. If no implantation has occured, there is no pregnancy , therefore no abortion. Since it is possible that implantation has occured prior to use of ECP then it's second action is to create an enviorment incondusive to the development of pregnancy. Since the latest a woman can take ECP is 5 days passed exposure, still atleast 9 days before a sensitive pregancy test could be read as positive, and there is no way of documenting a pregnancy before this time so it is also NOT an abortion. You could very well have a fetilized egg that does not implant due to natures will and have a period. There is no way of knowing if it was ECP that caused a period or natures will or if there was no ovulation at the time of exposure. You are not pregnant until the two lines on the test turn pink. If you were not pregnant, you did not have an abortion. With out documentation you are not pregnant. Just ask your health insurance company.\n \n You also equivocate the meaning of those words. If people were responsible and engaged in contraception in the first place..\n \n Point 2; Many many many woman (I realy can't stress this enough) use contraception (and use it correctly I may add) and still find themselves\n pregnant when they don't wish to be. Just becuse you are pregnant and don't want to be does not make you irresponsible. Even the best contraception has an error rate of 0.02% (This being a Mirenea IUD that uses both low dose hormones and IUD technology) Most pills and other methods run at about a 0.02 to 1% failure rate. Also I may remind you to the preivious paragragh where we disucssed \"EMERGANCY CONTRACEPTION\" which IS a form of contraception.\n \n ....As for rape (occurs much less frequently than simple irresponsible behavior) you have stated nothing to prove or show that pregnancy and delivery would kill the individual involved (assumes facts not in evidence)\n [B]\n Point 3; This IS a statistical fact; death rates from abortion in the USA are between .01 to 1 in 100,000 abortions. Death rates from childbirth are between 7 to 9 in 100,000 births. Feel free to check this with any reputible sourse. I recomend the CDC or you local OB/GYN. \n \n [/B]Is birth unsafe? No. But abortion is actually safer.",

   "I actually hate this subject, but I`ll butt in as I have nothing better to do..\n \n \n1)There would be no need to have a police officer present for every miscarriage. Reports from doctors would come only when they believed that the mother had done something illegal. This is true of mandatory reporting of child abuse. Situation no different. We don't have a police officer present each time a child shows up in the ER with an injury.\n \n\n \n Perhaps not. But I hope you at least investigate wether you should investigate every time a child shows up in the ER dead. Because this is what we are talking about, not some minor bone fracture. I can`t speak for your criminal system, but a dead child is rather serious business where I live...\n \n \n3) The police have mandatory reporting for other criminal problems such as gun shots and knife wounds. Criminal activity is criminal activity and should be reported, if you are not engaged in criminal activity (doing something wrong) then there is no reason to hide. She has a choice to seek medical attention and accept responsibility for her behavior and fight the law through legal means or accept the responsibility of preferring criminal activity to health.\n\n \n This does not invalidate the argument that making abortions illegal will result in black-market- and \"homegrown\" operations and even suicides, resulting in the deaths of countless women (and fetuses)\n \n 6)NOt even sure where this one comes from. It is totally irrelevant. Laws providing penalty for criminal behavior are not intended to prevent the behavior but to punish it. It is hoped that fear of punishment will have an effect, but it does not control people Therefore the following points 7-10 are all based on the idea that we are trying to prevent murder. Begged Question again.[/QUOTE]\n \n Isn`t laws intended to prevent certain behaviour and occurances? I find this very hard to believe. Just because you can`t control behaviour does not mean that you don`t seek to prevent certain behaviour... I can think of a few laws that are in place with the sole purpose of preventing certain behaviours (drink and drive, drug legislation, trafic ordinance (word?), etc etc). Allthopugh I would also argue that every single law is intended to somehow influence the behaviour of citizens. \n \n \nIf you fall down stairs and kill someone (must imagine if you could) you would not be charged with man-slaughter...the example of hitting someone with a car is not really a good one.\n\n \n Probably not manslaughter. But \"cause of another persons death\" (don`t know the exact legal term in english). This is a quite serious offence, and if coupled with irresponsible behaviour, it could result in quite a few years behind bars. Aggrevating in this case would of course be the fetus dependancy of the mother, which, if we do assume that a fetus is a person, would mean that basicly any actions that could lead to the death of the fetus would be harshly punished if the fetus actually did die because of the action.\n \n \n You realize that abortion was illegal before 1973 and kids were being born before 1973....it worked then without people being charged with murder. Your logic is seriously flawed in that history proves different.\n\n \n History shows nothing. A legal system does not have to be logic. In fact, it often contains huge logic flaws and inconsistencies. Especially if you back-track a few decades, centuries or millenias. There is a flaw (I don`t know if its a logic flaw, but at least it`s highly inconsistent) in the idea that a fetus is an individual and therefor abortion should be equalised as murder unless one recognizes every other individual right of a fetus as well (such as protection from negligent behaviour resulting in his/her death).",

Pregnancy is a special pact and bond, an intensely personal experience that should never ever ever be entered into because a woman has no other choice.

Taking a step out into the street is tacit acknowledgement that you may indeed be hit. You can take steps to avoid being hit, being careful and the like, but the fact remains that you may be hit by the bus each and every time you cross the street. And, since you acknowledge that this is a possibility, you should not recieve medical attention since you need to accept the consequences of your actions, isn't that right?\n \n How about another analogy? Lets say you got smashed, walked home and unlocked your door. Being smashed, you don't realize that you left your keys in your door; in fact you left your door ajar! A burglar comes into your house, since you basically invited him in when you irresponsibly left your door agap, and you hear him in your drunken supor lying in bed. You call the police. Do they say \"I'm sorry but you caused this to happen through your irresponsible behavior.

The intent can only be decided by the one who made things that way. Some would say God. Some would say evolution (if it is evolution then intent is really meaningless).\n \n The point is that unprotected sex can result in pregnancy period. For me to say, \"well, I just want to have sex to bond with my significant other\" is ridiculous. If I have sex whether intentionally or forced, I best be prepared for pregnancy. That is not to say I condone rape. Quite the opposite. However, the idea that one can have sex and expect that they should be able to not be pregnant is NOT an argument for abortion.

   "1)Clearly, every miscarriage would have to be investigated as murder. An internal examination would need to be carried out in the presence of a police officer as soon as the woman arrived at hospital. If the woman was found to have endangered her fetus in any way (drinking, having sex - oh hang on, we'd better make pregnant woman doing this illegal as it can cause a miscarriage) then she will be charged. Didn't know she was pregnant? That's no excuse! MURDERER!\n \n 2) if no proof of intent was found, then a miscarriage would also have to be investigated for manslaughter. If say, a woman fell down the stairs and caused a miscarriage then she would have to be tried and sentenced for accidental killing/manslaughter or similar. Just as when you drive you are liable if you kill somebody, you must be liable when you cause the death of the beloved fetus. Naturally pregnant women seen wearing high heels or tight jeans will be hauled in and charged with fetal endangerment -they're trying to induce a miscarriage! MURDERER!\n \n 8) Hmm major problem...as nobody knows of the fertilised eggs existence (unlike a born person who is fully registered) and it's not even visible to the human eye, we're going to have problems with women aborting and nobody knowing. Best that all women are pregnancy tested every fortnight - no, better make that every week - and then fully quizzed to make sure they plan no harm.\n \n Oh but hang on, a pregnancy test doesn't work in the first month...well this is a conundrum. She could MURDER the fertilised egg after conception and no-one would know! Best that all women hand in their sanitary towels for full inspection to check there's not a poor murdered fertilised egg in there. Any woman who claims to have no pad to hand in due to a late period or irregular cycle will be fully investigated by police and doctor and as a minimum of 2/3 of eggs fail to implant we're going to have a lot of potential murders to investigate. Any woman who doesn't look suitably distressed at her beloved babies death (they'll claim not to know there was a fertilised egg there of course, but that's no excuse) will instantly be swept off for questioning.\n \n 9) Lordy me, there are so many things that can harm a beloved sacred fetus...pregnant women must be forbidden to drink or smoke obviously, and must stick to a healthy diet (naturally failure to take prenatal vitamins will be punished). But what about pollution? Any woman who walks beside a road or indeed, gets too close to a car will be prosecuted. Need to get to work? Tchah! That could be MURDER! In fact, lets ship all pregnant women to the middle of the countryside where they can be supervised to make sure they're behaving properly. Oh but hang on...a woman could be pregnant and we wouldn't know it - best to ship off all women just in case.\n \n\n \n You have very poor logic. The problem aren't miscarriages; the problem is abortion. Miscarriages have happened and always will happen, whether or not it was purposeful or not, abortion is a recent phenomenon, and it is the DELIBERATE, OBVIOUS murder of an innocent human being. Miscarriages are almost never deliberate, and sometimes not even obvious. Though I don't believe we should investigate miscarriages (that's obviously impossible), we should only allow fetal-threatening herbs as prescriptions, and in addition a woman has to take a pregnancy test before being allowed to use the prescriptions. This may sound intrusive, but should private abortions become a problem, these laws must be places to protect the lives of our future generations. \n \n \n3) Now as women will still self abort (for they can be EVIL like that) they will not be able to go to the ER and get treatment, meaning they'll bleed to death at home. That's great - saves us bothering to execute them for their heinous crime.\n\n \n That doesn't justify anything. If a thief broke his arm stealing a purse, should theft be legalized? Obviously not. \n \n \n4) Clearly emergency contraception would be banned and as vitamin C can cause implantation failure well, that would have to be banned too. Or perhaps it would be simpler to forbid women to buy vitamin C tablets, or indeed oranges. Their men can get it for them though, so better make anything containing a significant amount of vitamin c illegal. There'll be a scurvy epidemic of course but that's better than MURDER!!\n \n 6) But wait, abortion can happen in so many ways! All herbs that can cause an abortion must be banned and so must acupuncture which can also cause MURDER! What a shame that so many people will have this avenue of treatment shut down for them. Obviously RU486 willlbe forbidden but there's the pesky internet to deal with...impossible to shut down these sites selling the drug and impossible to stop all the drugs coming into this country (heck, walk round a college dorm and we'll see what a great job we do stopping cannabis getting into the country) so to prevent \"murder\" it's best to stop women using the internet. Or indeed men. Better ban it altogether! \n\n \n Smoking in front of children can kill children, and yet we don't have laws against it. Drinking in front of children can cause psychological damage, and again, no laws against it. \n \n \n5) Not only would e/c be banned but as the IUD, pill and well, pretty much all non-barrier methods can cause implantation failure they would be banned. Yes it's a shame for all women who rely on the pill etc for health reasons but hey. Now of course as the only b/c left (barrier methods, NFP and spermicide) are the least effective method of b/c there will be more unplanned pregnancies. And of course an increased number of rape and incest pregnancies (can't have the rape victims MURDERING their offspring with e/c!) and conceivably an increase in rapes as abusive men seek to impregnate their victims, but hey, what ya gonna do? Far better than a woman is brutally raped than a fertilised egg fails to implant!\n\n \n Ohh... poor baby... you want to have sex and you have to use a condom... I feel so sorry for you. Would you like a complimentary box of Trojans for you and your boyfriend? Rape doesn't justify the murder of a child. It certainly is not legal for a rapist to get the death penalty (unless he murdered somebody), why on earth should it be legal for the fetus to get the death penalty for an action he didn't commit?\n \n \n7)Hmmmm, legally the woman can travel to another country to abort...better make a law against that one too. But how are we going to check? A woman could not tell anyone she's pregnant and hop over to Canada, so I suggest that all women who travel are subjected to pregnancy tests when they leave and when they come back. Or perhaps we could just forbid women to travel if they're pregnant: need life saving surgery in another country? No! Need to travel on business? Noo! Fathers funeral? Noooo! You might be planning to MURDER!\n\n \n Countries already have laws against this. No, we won't ban woman from going to other countries to abort. That doesn't become an issue of law, but of ethics. Abortion is legally wrong as well as ethically wrong, but once the woman goes into another country, our laws are null and void, and the only thing the woman can break is her self-preserving morality. She can have an abortion, that's not our say, but she is ruining herself and another human being.\n \n \n10) We'll have to have an overhall of the social security system as obviously, a shnoogy little fertilised egg can get welfare. We'll have to overhall the way we register births and deaths, not to mention the increased amount of funerals for this *sniff* poor little zefs. Then we'll have to re-write the constitution and laws to remove that silly little part about \"born persons\" and any mention of (snigger) bodily autonomy.\n\n \n We wont have to do any of this. You're being completely ridiculous, in fact. Every person gets a right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness whether or not he is a citizen. Citizens obviously get more rights- welfare, social security, etc. The constitution protects the life of ALL humanity, and gives benefits to citizens. A human is not a citizen until birth, according to the constitution. \n \n \nTalking of which, as forced organ donation is now law, everybody get ready to donate your kidneys, blood, corneas etc! wait a minute, what's that I hear about not wanting to harm yourself donating your bodily resources? Hypocrite and MURDERER!! look forward to the news titles \"...and today a man was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment for causing another mans blindness through refusal to donate a cornea...\" Nah, something tells me forced organ donation will magically only apply to pregnancy meaning that women officially now have less rights than men. Well, the womens lib thing was overrated anyway and lets face it, and the extreme right wing fundies will be happy so it evens out nicely.\n\n \n Huh?\n \n And the rest is pure rubbish.",

   "Firstly, I believe that Jessica was stating extreams and useing sarcasam to promote her view. I don't think she meant to be taken litearaly.\n \n But I find some flaws here in your retort I would like to piont out.\n \n \n 4) The logical fallacy here is non-sequitor. Contraception is prior to conception. Emergency contraception is just a fancy name for abortion.\n [B]\n Point 1; Emerancy contraception is in no way an abortion. It's primary action is to create an enviorment incondusive to implantation of a fertilized zygote with in the uterus. If no implantation has occured, there is no pregnancy , therefore no abortion. Since it is possible that implantation has occured prior to use of ECP then it's second action is to create an enviorment incondusive to the development of pregnancy. Since the latest a woman can take ECP is 5 days passed exposure, still atleast 9 days before a sensitive pregancy test could be read as positive, and there is no way of documenting a pregnancy before this time so it is also NOT an abortion. You could very well have a fetilized egg that does not implant due to natures will and have a period. There is no way of knowing if it was ECP that caused a period or natures will or if there was no ovulation at the time of exposure. You are not pregnant until the two lines on the test turn pink. If you were not pregnant, you did not have an abortion. With out documentation you are not pregnant. Just ask your health insurance company.\n\n I am not sure what the current scientific definition of pregnancy is but it is known in science that \"pregnancy\" is initiated at conception. A pregnancy test does not determine if one is pregnant. It shows the presence of a pregnancy at a certain point. I would say also that documentation is not a determinant of pregnancy but a record of it. Implantation is not a determinant of pregnancy but a step of pregnancy. So whether the ECP acts to prevent implantation or to discontinue it, its result is an abortion.\n \n \nYou also equivocate the meaning of those words. If people were responsible and engaged in contraception in the first place..\n \n Point 2; Many many many woman (I realy can't stress this enough) use contraception (and use it correctly I may add) and still find themselves\n pregnant when they don't wish to be. Just becuse you are pregnant and don't want to be does not make you irresponsible. Even the best contraception has an error rate of 0.02% (This being a Mirenea IUD that uses both low dose hormones and IUD technology) Most pills and other methods run at about a 0.02 to 1% failure rate. Also I may remind you to the preivious paragragh where we disucssed \"EMERGANCY CONTRACEPTION\" which IS a form of contraception.\n\n The morning after pill can only be labeled a contraceptive if it has that effect. It would more properly be termed an abortifacient in the roles you discussed. Contraception means \"against conception.\" So if a pill's action is a to instigate a process after conception then it is not contraception.\n \n At best, it can be called a contraceptive and abortifacient but so can the traditional \"birth control\" pill.",

   "THIS is what I'm looking for. I believe that the fetus is equal to infant, child, adult, and elderly alike, as it is just one other part of the human life. \nYou can BELIEVE anything you want. You can believe that the fetus is a saint or a bag of dried fish. However, IN REALITY, \"fetus\" is the descriptor of the developmental status beginning at the 9th week and ending at birth, while \"baby\" is the developmental stage beginning at birth. Emotive prolife revisionist linguistical hyperbole doesn't change that. Wishful thinking are not facts.\n \n \nPlease explain, in scientific terms, how the fetus is part of the mother's body.\nIt is not an individual entity, it is connected through the umbilical cord with bloodvessels, completely like a bodily organ is,\n \n \nPregnancy occurs when the 23 chromosomes from the father and the 23 chromosomes from the mother meet at the ovum. \nHmm, that would mean that a trisomy-21 conception never leads to \"pregnancy,\" and as such, when a kid with Down's Syndrome is born, mommy was never pregnant (And likewise with the other chromosome duplications and absences). Fascinating claim.\n \n That nonsense aside, the other silly claim is that pregnancy starts at conception, when in fact it begins at implantation. \"Pregnancy\" is the event that involves the woman's body.\n \n \n\"The fusion of the ovum's and sperm's nuclei to form a diploid cell completes the first stage of pregnancy.\" -Wikipedia\nWhich is why dictionaries are only that starting point. Don't get your scientific facts from dictionaries, they are notoriously science-illiterate. Go ask your physician instead.\n \n \n \nI'm not talking about killing her newborn child, I'm talking about whether or not the woman wants to be a MOTHER. If she doesn't want to be a mother, she should be allowed to kill her newborn child, don't you agree?\nNope, she should have the right to not have any interaction with the newborn; she has the right to remove it... Oh, wait, she already has that right, it is called adoption.\n \n You were saying.....?\n \n \nVery, very poor logic. \nRather, very, very poor argument from you.\n \n \nBut it's not just hte rapist's baby- it's YOUR baby, in fact more so since the father wasn't present for the baby. YOUR egg was apart of the process. Why on earth would you want to kill YOUR child.\nThere is no baby and no child until birth, your prolife hyperbole (You can fill in the rest of the descriptors yourself, they are provided above)......\n \n And that aside, the nonsentient product of conception is a constant reminder of the rape, as if the rape was ongoing for the next 9 months. IF I could get pregnant and was raped, you can bet that I would immediately remove that ongoing violation of my body.",

An abortion is the termination of the pregnany, a termination of the implanted conseptus.\n\n An abortion is the termination of an implanted conceptus but not a termination of a conceptus that has not yet implanted? Do natural, spontaneous abortions only involve implanted conceptuses (sp?)? \n \n \nFalse, per the above fact.\n\n CAN you tell me how, in the role Xeiah discussed, that the drug described as \"emergency contraception\" acts to prevent conception? If you cannot then it is not a contraception in that scenario.\n \n \nBut rather is birth control, yes. As such, some pills both prevent conception and also can be birth control.\n\n What do you mean they can prevent conception and be \"birth control?\" Do you mean that the \"birth control pill\" has another role besides contraception and how is that \"birth control?\" I say it is a contraceptive and abortifacient. Is your birth control role different than a role as an abortifacient?\n \n \nPer your definition, a contraceptive can NEVER be an abortifacient.\n\n That is not what I said. Of course a contraceptive can also be an abortifacient. When it acts to prevent conception then it is a contraceptive. When it aborts the fertilized egg then it is an abortifacient. But one should not call it a contraceptive when it is acting as an abortifacient. Many of these drugs have multiple actions.",

   "Simone,\n \nSteeeeve, speak for the majority of the animal species in limiting the sexual act to \"reproduction only.\" Humans have generally evolved beyond the limited animal state and their sexual nature has also evolved. The purpose of having sex in humans is essentially for pleasure, for the connubial bliss of marriage--when so chosen, it serves in the act of reproduction. These are not the only purposes of sex in humans--some humans are driven by pure lust, a minority of humans use sex as a weapon to get what they want, to manipulate people, in the case of rape (which is not really sex) it serves to humiliate, injure, subjugate its victim.\n\n When you say that sex in humans is \"essentially for pleasure\" that is only half true. I agree with you that part of the essential  nature of sex is pleasure. But there is an essential/inherent aspect of sex that is for procreation/generation of other humans. The word essential is key. \n \n Would you say that those who are driven by pure lust are using sex in the right way?

Kennedy suffered from a physical ailment that perpetually caused him to be aroused, which ailment he very successfully hid away, which various dalliances he engaged in as a result of this ailment also being successfully hidden with the tacit cooperation of staff, Mrs. Kennedy, various male reporters, etc., etc. It is also to be noted that in the historically Roman Catholic family of the Kennedys there was also a historically prominent tendancy for male Kennedys to engage in a great number of extramarital affairs owing to the male-dominant Roman Catholic culture in which they were brought up which forbade female sexual pleasure but gloried in the male gender cavorting around as much as possible. I am very, very sure that Rose Kennedy never experienced an orgasm, which is very likely why, after the birth of Teddy Kennedy, she exiled Mr. Joseph Kennedy the elder from the marital bed.

The two situations are not comparable and it is dishonest to try and draw a moral comparison.\n \n A born child can be given up for adoption, given to family, given to friends, given to strangers, can be left at hospitals and fire-stations under the safe-haven law... etc. There are a myriad of options open that allows a mother to not care for a born child if she does not want to, while allowing it to live.\n \n There are only 2 options during the pregnancy: continue or abort. There is only 1 option open if she does not want to be pregnant, and you want to take away that only choice.\n\n \n You're straying from the issue again. You are comparing the fetus and the infant in a practical way, and I wholeheartedly agree that it is much easier to put a child up for adoption than to wait for the fetus to be born. However, this is based on no moral grounds. Convenience does not define morality. Moraltiy is simply defined based on what is morally right or wrong. It is WRONG to kill your child. Even if it would be easier to kill your child than to hold on to it, it would be WRONG to kill your child. Unless the mother has no physical threat to her child, she has no reason to kill it, and the same goes for the mother and her fetus. She has NO REASON to kill the fetus BESIDES convenience, and convenience does not justify brutal murder. \n \n \nI beg your pardon, Parcum, how do you draw that conclusion?\n \n Have you ever studied biology, Parcum? Or, is all of your limited knowledge and understanding restricted to the Roman Catholic doctrine you have learned by rote?\n \n First of all, a month-old infant can exist independly of his/her mother. Anyone who is willing to devote the time and energy and resources to ensure that an infant has shelter, nourishment and constant supervision, love and nurturance, all of these, can serve as a parent to said infant.\n \n That cannot be said of a fertilized egg, a zygote, an embryo, a fetus that has not developed enough to survive outside the womb.\n \n I strongly recommend that you devote yourself to a bit of science study.\n Reply With Quote\n\n \n I have absolutely no idea how you link biology to your argument. Is it because you mentioned the word \"zygote\"? Once again, an irrelevent argument; it doesn't prove anything. If a 4-month old fetus were born prematurely and needed life support for four months, would it be just to kill the fetus? It's inconvenient for the nurses to take care of the newborn for four months. You're causing them psychological trauma; you're making them work hard; they may even get sick. But once again, does that justify murder? Of course not.",

In what way is my stance not consistant?\n \n \n\n Please tell me how this question has anything to do with what we're talking about. \n\n \n You asked:\"Should they still be allowed to brutally kill the person in the coma?\", so I replied: \"Why would they brutally kill the person in any case?\".\n \n Your question was non-sensical because in no case would they \"brutally kill the person\". I was asking for clarification.\n \n \n\n You're straying from the issue again. You are comparing the fetus and the infant in a practical way, and I wholeheartedly agree that it is much easier to put a child up for adoption than to wait for the fetus to be born.\n\n \n No, I was comparing the fetus and infant in the context of being a \"parasite\".\n \n You said:\"How about if a mother abandonded her 1-month old daughter? The infant is a parasite!\", and I was pointing out that, practically speaking, the situation of the fetus and the infant cannot be compared in this sense because the infant can be put down or in other ways removed from the mother with no (physical) ill effects. The fetus cannot be, so comparing them is dishonest.\n \n \n\n However, this is based on no moral grounds. Convenience does not define morality.\n\n \n I am not arguing this, you are straying from the issue :)\n \n What I am saying is based on moral grounds, actually. Morally, a situation with a myriad of options to separate yourself from an infant without any ill effects is different than a situation with no other option to separate yourself from a fetus. Trying to draw a moral comparison is dishonest as well.\n \n \n\n Moraltiy is simply defined based on what is morally right or wrong. It is WRONG to kill your child. Even if it would be easier to kill your child than to hold on to it, it would be WRONG to kill your child. Unless the mother has no physical threat to her child, she has no reason to kill it, and the same goes for the mother and her fetus. She has NO REASON to kill the fetus BESIDES convenience, and convenience does not justify brutal murder.\n\n \n Again, you're straying from the issues and are arguing about abortion in general now :P\n \n Morals are subjective. To many people a just concieved zygote isn't a child, an embryo isn't a child and a fetus is not a child. A zygote does not have the same moral weight as a born child, an embryo does not have the same moral weight as a born child and a fetus does not have the same moral weight as a born child.\n \n What you call convenience others would call need. Is it convenience to have an abortion if you have no other way to support yourself besides financial aid that will only pay for housing and food if you go to school full time? Is it conenience if you are afraid of being kicked out of your house at 14? Truly told, you have no moral authority to damn others for desperate choices.\n \n Even regardless of the moral issue, which I feel you have no ground to stand on, there is the issue of rights. The gov't should not violate women's rights, even to ensure another's survival. In order to support the fetus' right to live off of her body, the woman's rights are necessarily reduced because she would then have no right to deny the use of her body and no right to the bodily resources denied her because of the fetus. The woman's rights should not be reduced or violated in favor of what is growing inside her. Pregnancy and motherhood should not be entered into because a woman has no other choice.

I don't know about your area, but here in San Francisco, it's usually considered murder.\n\n \n I can think of no situation involving a born child that is analogous to the pregnancy relationship.

Sure, it's a hypothetical situation, but that doesn't excuse you from answering it. \n\n \n In an unrelated discussion, yes it does. The situation you presented is not analogous to abortion. If you come up with a situation analogous to abortion, regardless if it is hypothetical or not, then I would answer it. What I said is not irrelevant, because it was showing how the situation you presented is not analogous to abortion.\n \n \n\n One moral code? I'll tell you. In traditional chinese religions, Hinduisum, Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and most tribal religions, homosexuality is condemned; infantcide is condemned; abortion is condemned; marriage is required before sexual relations; these type of morals are supported by most of the world.\n\n \n A couple of things.

Whatever else they condemn is irrelevant.\n \n Second, religion does not equal morals.

If it were my moral opinion that killing 10-year-old children was right, would that justify killing 10-year-old children? If it were my moral opinion that water doesn't exist, does that make me right? Absolutely not. \n\n \n Do you practise being obtuse? Independently verifiable concepts or physical matter are not analogous to a psychological and changable framework such as a moral code. \n \n There will still be 2 objects if 1 object is with another object if humans did not exist. Water would be there if humans did not exist. Morals would not exist without humans because there is no objective framework.\n \n \n\n Explain.\n \n\n \n You said: \"If morals are subjective, than morals don't exist\". That is not true. It just means that objective morals do not exist.\n \n \n\n The newborn is certainly living off of the mother in this situation; its drinking from the mother's breasts, its requiring the mother labor care for it. You've obviously never raised a child if you honestly believe the newborn doesn't live off of the mother. A newborn DOES.\n\n \n You have no idea if I have or have not raised children, either my own or others. I understand that a newborn is dependant on the mother and father.\n \n A newborn is not analogous, however, because a newborn can be put down, can be put up for adoption, etc. With a newborn, the woman has the option of not caring for it with no (physical) ill effects, at least for a certain amount of time. A woman can leave the newborn with friends while she goes out, etc. With a newborn the woman has a choice of whether to care for it, and has a myriad of options open to her if she does not want to, without harming the newborn.\n \n She cannot do this with a fetus. A fetus is a constant drain in a way a newborn is not. The woman has no way of putting it down, has no way of stopping the detrimental effects on her body without abortion. With a fetus, the woman has one choice to remove from her care and that is abortion.\n \n \n\n No, she is not being punished, she is suffering the consequences of her actions. \n\n \n If all you want is for her to suffer the consequences of her actions, I have to say that abortion is a consequence of her actions. It is simply not the consequence you want her to suffer, but one she chooses herself.\n \n \n\n Stop going around in circles. My daughter has no right to be living in my home. I'm going to kill her. \n\n \n How does that follow? How is this analogous to abortion? Do you have no other choice but to kill her to get her out of your home? Is she violating your right to bodily integrity? Is she living off of your organs without your consent? None of the arguments for abortion apply in that situation; it is not analogous.\n \n \n\n Morally, she is not. Biologically, she is a mother.\n\n \n Agreed. I personally think motherhood is (and should be) a choice. A woman who continues the pregnancy but has no intention of keeping it is not what I consider a mother to be. Conversly, a woman who has never had children can be.\n \n \n\n However, mothers bad enough to allow the death of their children are punishable by law.\n\n \n Born children, definetly. If they are living off of her organs and bodily processes she has the right to remove herself from that, however.",

In traditional chinese religions, Hinduisum, Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and most tribal religions, homosexuality is condemned; infantcide is condemned; abortion is condemned; marriage is required before sexual relations; these type of morals are supported by most of the world. YES, there is a universal moral code, and most of the world follows it.\nParcum??\n \n Obviously you don't know very much about world cultures. Until very recently the burning of widows alive was fairly widely practiced in India. In the sects of Islam that follow a perverted form of Sharia it is acceptable to stone to death the victim of rape. Female infants have been done away with fairly routinely in many parts of the world until relatively recently.\n \n Ahah! So that's the Universal Code of the Roman Catholic Church!!! Note the pervasive misogyny cited in the previous paragraph. It is only recently, with the advent of FEMINISM that it has been UNACCEPTABLE to treat the female sex in such a way. I am a FEMINIST and I follow the FEMINIST MORAL CODE!!! And, I do not want to hear any sewage about your SPURIOUS MORAL CODE!!!!!",

There is no rationale of \"my body, my right\" because little Ivan is not attached to her body with her providing complete organ support involuntarily. The act of feeding and caring for Ivan is completely voluntary on her part, given that she must actively do it (and is no coersion, etc). \n \n Taking your example on it's own merits, there is no valid reason to kill Ivan. She can still leave him with strangers. If your point assumes that no one in that town will care for a child, then it kind of blows your assumption of universal morals out of the water ;) Unless his living threatens her existance, there is no valid reason to kill him. Even then, unless she is physically unable to remove him from her care, there is no reason to kill him.\n \n I have to say, though, in that situation I would not be surprised if little Ivan was killed. Desperate situations are very cruel, and dependants are usually the first to be killed off. In that case, I would be hard pressed to condemn her, even if I disagreed with it.",

   "Those lines it mentions are up for interpretation in many ways of they are the reason - expecting a bronze age culture to understand the essentials of human development is a bit much.\n \n \nIn reference to pregnant women, the term \"with child\" occurs twenty-six times in the Bible. The term \"with fetus\" never occurs once. \n Does anyone actually use the term 'with fetus'? Its just a phrase rather than a strict biological definition.\n \n \nIn Luke chapter one, verses 36 and 41, we are told that Elisabeth conceived a \"son\" and that the \"babe\" leaped in her womb. God does not say that a \"fetus\" leaped in her womb! He says THE BABE leaped. This is the exact same word that God uses to describe Christ in the manger AFTER He is born (Luke 2:12, 16). In God eyes, an unborn babe and a newborn babe are the same. They are both living human beings!\n It also says 'leaped' so the fully developed child (its only a baby after its born) suddenly jumps off the floor and burrows into her womb! Clearly this is what happened as God does not say the zygote implanted in the wall of the uterus...or is god a little hazy on human biology, he never had to use the messy way when he made people I guess ;)\n \n The rest are the same...closest you can actually get is the God knowing you before you were born, but for an omniscient being that exist outside of time, why is this even an issue.\n \n 'Mischief' I think really needs to be clarified.\n \n As to Steeve original reply - no, we don't kill all the mindless groups of cells because we want the child that they will grow into.\n Don't assume that pro-choice automatically want abortions for all, nor even want all forms of abortion to be legalised.\n Most fall under the 'up til it is able to sense/realise' whats happening to it. Except in extreme circumstances (i.e where the mother will die) I can see no need for partial birth abortions as a general practice.",

As for number 4...I can't be selfish because I get nothing out of it. Helping someone out is not really selfish.\n\n \n No, but hurting one to help another is.\n \n \n\n Also, I was talking about how I thought abortion was selfish...why it is wrong is another topic :). \n\n \n Ok.\n \n \n\n As for us libertarians...Since libertarians believe government should be there to protect us from one another and I believe that the unborn is a person/life/whatever you wanna call it...therefore it makes sense that I could be libertarian and pro-life.\n\n \n That is true, but it still conflicts with the concept of the gov't declaring one right \"more important\" than other rights. When the will of the State is more important than individual rights that is fascism, not libertarianism.\n \n \n\n Since when does partial birth abortion not exist?\n\n \n There is no procedure called \"partial birth abortion\". It is a made up name that pro-life advocates used to describe many different procedures for the purposes of banning them in one bill, the \"Partial Birth Abortion\" ban.\n \n \n\n I dont care the reason for the same reason why I don't care what the reason of a why someone kills another.\n\n \n Well, perhaps you don't care but the law does :P \n \n If someone invades your home you can justifiably kill them. During war killing is justified, and capital punishment is justified. Whether or not killing is justified depends on the circumstances. \n \n \n\n you say the gov't cannot violate your rights to enforce anothers...but couldn't the unborn say this too?\n\n \n No, because the \"unborn\" (this term always makes me think of \"undead\" to describe the living ;) ) do not have rights. Even if they did, any confict of rights should be resolved in the woman's favor, given that she is the most important participant in the pregnancy relationship.\n \n \n\n wait...didn't you say you were at work Sigma? hehe I'm telling your boss you are slackin \n\n \n heh, I am slacking ;) I've gotten in trouble because of these forums before, but the boss is gone today :P",

   "I think so too, but what I am asking is whether, during this discussion between boy and girl, if there is disagreement, who wins? Yes, it's up to both, but if there is no consensus, who wins? The woman/girl would seem to have the advantage in that situation. Afterall, it's her body.\n\n \n Exactly. \n \n \nI couldn't make her have an abortion nor could I make her have a baby.\n But she has the power to make me a father or to end the baby's life no matter what I want.\n\n \n No - you can sign away your parental rights. You do have a choice. Just because it's not a choice you would make does not mean you get to make decisions for her when she is pregnant.\n \n \nI guess what I am asking is, does the man lay any claim whatsoever to the woman's body after she is impregnated by him? Does he have any \"rights\" with regard to the woman's body as it pertains to his child?\n\n \n **Shudder**\n A man get to claim any rights to the woman's body? No.\n The answer is absolutely not.\n \n \nI never meant to trivialize it. \n I understand. It's no picknick. Hey, maybe to some women it's utter hell.\n\n \n Yuck - I hated pregnancy.\n \n \nThat's not the point. \n The point is that it is over in a relatively short period of time.\n\n \n Yes, but a pregnancy can impact a lot - and even do damage in that short period time. Plus it's more than nine months. I wasn't fully back to normal - physically or hormonally for a full year after I gave birth.\n \n \nThereafter, the product of said pregnancy is around (hopefully) for the rest of the parents' lives. \n\n \n No - you are going to scare more people into abortionsa with talk like that. This sounds like advocating forced parenting. Not a good thing - lots of people that are real lousy with kids - if they want to give the baby away - that is good thing.\n \n \nI'm sorry, but how could I turn my back on my own child?\n I don't see these as options.\n\n \n But they are. And you can't legislate around what you, personally would or could do.\n \n \nI can't really tell what you are saying.\n You are saying that the woman's desires always trump the man's just because she is the one with the womb?\n\n \n Yes - it's her womb.\n \n \nIf she wants to have the baby and the man doesn't, he's stuck being a father for likely the rest of his life (no matter what he signs).\n\n \n No - he's not.\n \n \nIf he did want the baby and the woman wanted an abortion he just has to live the rest of his life knowing that his child was killed. He is totally powerless.\n \n Maybe he should just abstain from sex. ;)\n\n \n Well - there is one way to address it.",

   "Exactly. \n\n So if the wishes of the man conflict with those of the woman, he has no right to decide what happens to HIS unborn baby. \n \n \n \n \nNo - you can sign away your parental rights. You do have a choice.

(well, what would I know, I've never raised one, but I can claim responsibility for more than a few grey hairs on my folks' heads.) \n \n Look, biology is unfair in that one sex must have the baby.\n I guess you are saying that because of this inequity, that men should suffer their own inequity in not having any rights to their unborn offspring.\n \n \n \n \nNo - you are going to scare more people into abortionsa with talk like that.

Not a good thing - lots of people that are real lousy with kids - if they want to give the baby away - that is good thing.\n\n How am I advocating forced parenting by saying that hopefully a child outlives its parents? \n \n Hey there are lots of folks out there that I don't think should be breeding, it's usually the ones with the most kids, but when people give up their kids, what are the chances that they will be better off? Don't they usually end up in orphanages or foster care? Finding a \"good home\" takes a really long time, especially if the kids make it past 2-3. I know this can't be the case but you are making it sound like people shouldn't be burdened with children if they don't want to be and should just dump them on the state. \n \n\n But they are. And you can't legislate around what you, personally would or could do.\n\n Ok, I'm not saying there shouldn't be laws in place to handle these situations. I'm saying that no matter who you dump your kids onto or how you do it, the kid is always your flesh and blood. \n \n \n \n \nYes - it's her womb.\n\n But its HIS baby. I'm sorry, THEIR baby.\n \n \n \n \nNo - he's not.\n\n Maybe STUCK was the wrong word.\n The child will be HIS child for the rest of his life.\n I know some papas are rolling stones and they breed with multiple baby's mammas and leave them to raise the kids however they can, but the kids are always HIS.\n \n So, summing up, I think what you are saying is that there are ways that both sexes can skirt the responsibilty of having a child once conceived. The female can do it by terminating the pregnancy. The man can only do it by signing parental rights away and forgetting he actually has a child in this world.",

   "So if the wishes of the man conflict with those of the woman, he has no right to decide what happens to HIS unborn baby. \n\n \n Yes. That is the legal truth and how it must be. I can't tell you what to do with your body either. I mean, it's her body, the idea that you want the law to allow men some sort of ownership rights over the women they have had sex with scares me more than abortion bans.\n \n It was only 25 years ago that my mother could not get her tubes tied without my father's permission (a man who later dumped his kids). My grandmother was not allowed birth control with my grandfather's permission - an abusive, crazy SOB.

Let's not start returning women to property status.\n \n \nShe would be making decisions for ME while she is pregnant.\n Decisions that I would have absolutely no say in.\n She would get to decide whether or not I become a father, not me.\n\n \n That's a stretch. She would be making decisions for her body. If you want fatherhood so bad - find a woman who wants to be a mother. Don't expect ownership rights over all your girlfriend's bodies.\n \n \nBut HIS baby is inside said body.\n\n \n I know this is going to sound terribly callous but here goes - if your dog showed up in her yard, or your mom, she would not have to take care of them either.\n \n \nDoes he have any rights whatsoever with regard to his unborn child?

I know this can't be the case but you are making it sound like people shouldn't be burdened with children if they don't want to be and should just dump them on the state. \n\n \n Older kids are generally the ones in orphanages or foster care.

Why tell me what my views of men are? I hold plenty of men in hight regard. The point I was making is that the number of men protected by abortion bans is signifigantly smaller than the number of women that will be hurt by them.\n \n \nOk, this really isn't about me so let's take an extreme situation.\n \n Boy meets girl in a bar and they go to his place and do it. \n They go out for a few weeks and do it lots and lots.\n The woman is just in it for the sex, but the guy is really falling in love.\n The woman accidentally gets pregnant and tells the guy.\n The guy is ecstatic and asks her to marry him and have the baby.\n She says, sorry but I wasn't really that into you, so I'm going to abort your baby and dump you.\n \n The woman is totally justified in her choices or what?\n\n \n In refusing to marry a guy she does not love? Absolutely.\n \n As far as the sex leading to kid - you are both guilty of that, hopefully you will make the choice together - but you don't get to tell her what to do with her body for nine months - let alone what to do with the rest of her life.\n \n \nI've been seeing a large influx of imported baby's around here.

But there must be a percentage of babies that don't get adopted right away and they end up in the foster care system. \n\n \n That is due to a fear that the birth mother will try to get her baby back and the fact that the demand is higher than the supply. I regurly check the foster/adoption care list for Hennepin County (Minneapolis), as I have considered adopting an older child - I never, ever seen an infant on that list. \n \n \nSo a man is a sperm donor, the sperm is what is of value.\n But when the man wants his baby, the woman just will not be his incubator.\n I love how you can degrade a man to the point of being simply a sperm donor, but whever we talk about his claim to his unborn child, we say that a woman is more than some incubator baby machine. Nice double standard!\n\n \n I am devaluing a very specific man here - not all men. My ex-husband is a worthless peice of trash who abused me and has never supported or even checked in on his son. That is why I call him a sperm donor - that's all he ever did. I have a new co-parent now. I stand by my statement. Fatherhood requires more than DNA.",
