   "Pope Benedict is in Brazil and the Vatican has just canonized the first Brazilian saint, some monk who died in 1822 who wrote prayers on strips of paper, so-called prayer pills, which the faithful ingest to help them do something. Curing illness is claimed, but perhaps they do other things. There is a church in his name to this day that still distributes these prayer pills, though no longer written by the dead guy himself. It was reported that these pills have cured 24,000 persons of various ailments.\n \n The process of sainthood includes \"documentation\" of miracles. There is \"evidence\" that a couple people in the 1990s were cured in this way.\n \n Now, really. Of course this is bogus. But two questions:\n \n 1. Do you think Benedict really believes this stuff? I can't imagine he does. Or does he just promote it because the followers eat this stuff up and he feels he can ultimately do some good by having avid believers?\n 2. Latin America was pi$$ed off that the latest pope didn't come from there. Is the Vatican throwing them a bone with this latest maneuver?",

   "I disagree, the very compilation of the Bible suggests that we value the faith and understanding of some Christians more than others, in particular certain apostles, who were the first Saints. The establishment of the process of canonisation is simply the act of recognising that there are certain Christians whose life and witness are worthy of emulation. The formalism of this process is perhaps poor, but the requirement for evidence of miracles chimes with some protestants' insistance that everyone receive outward gifts of the spirit. The thinking being that the granting of miracles is a sign from God of his approval. In the Anglican tradition we no longer have a formal process of canonisation, but we do by tradition recognise the life and witness of certain great figures in the history of Christianity, including all the pre-reformation saints, and martyrs from both sides of that conflict, and more recent reformers such as Wesley.",

They have been wrongly taught that Mary was a perpetual virgin, though the Bible clearly teaches the very opposite! It is certainly correct that Mary was a virgin when Jesus was supernaturally conceived in her through the power of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:31, 34-35). In fact, God even sent an angel to explain this to her espoused husband, Joseph, who was obviously shaken upon learning that Mary was pregnant (Matthew 1:19-20). Notice the plain scriptural statement that Joseph \"took Mary home to be his wife, but had no intercourse with her until her son was born. And he named the child Jesus\" (vv. 24-25, NEB). Mary was a virgin at the time of Jesus' conception and birth, but after that, she and Joseph had a normal marital relationship and she gave birth to other children who were the fruit of their union. Notice the comments of the townspeople in Nazareth where Jesus had grown up. He had come preaching powerfully, and they were astonished. \"Where did this Man get this wisdom and these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary? And His brothers James, Joses, Simon, and Judas? And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where did this Man get all these things?\" (Matthew 13:54-56). Clearly, Jesus had brothers and sisters-and the people in His hometown were well aware of them. \n While James and the others were not disciples during the time of Jesus' earthly ministry, He appeared to James after the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:4-7). In 1 Corinthians 9:5, Paul describes the \"brethren of the Lord\" as ministers who were active in spreading the gospel. Clearly, after the resurrection, Christ's family was converted (Acts 1:14). They now knew that the One with whom they had grown up, their older brother, was in fact the Son of God. From early in the history of the New Testament Church, James the Lord's brother had a leading role. He is described in Acts 15 as being the one who presided over the Jerusalem Church, and the important Church council that was held there. In Galatians 2:9, Paul mentions him as one of the three \"pillars\" of the Church along with Peter and John. When Paul came back to Jerusalem, Luke states that he \"went in with us to James, and all the elders were present\" (Acts 21:18). \n James and his younger brother Jude wrote the books of the New Testament that bear their names. Jude, identifying himself in the first verse as James' brother, goes on to give a vital exhortation: \"I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints\" (Jude 3). The faith once for all delivered? Think about the implications of that statement. Did James and Jude understand the message that Jesus Christ delivered to the world? Did they know what He taught and practiced? If the form of Christianity acknowledged in today's world differs drastically from that practiced by James and Jude, as Dunn (noted above) and others have observed, then who had it right? Whose form of Christianity is true to that which was once for all delivered by Jesus Christ, the very founder of Christianity? \n Jude went on to explain that, even in his day, what was called Christianity was beginning to follow very divergent paths. How was this possible? \"For certain men have crept in unnoticed... ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness\" (Jude 4). Webster's Unabridged Dictionary defines licentiousness as being \"unrestrained by law.\" Even in the first century, some were distorting the meaning of grace to imply that God's law was no longer binding upon Christians.

St. Jerome soundly refuted them.\n \n Click on the link and read his defense:\n The Perpetual Virginity of Mary: Against Helividius by Saint Jerome circa 383 A.D.\n \n http://www.cin.org/users/james/files/helvidiu.htm\n \n Even Martin Luther, the instigator of the Reformation accepted the Perpetual Virginity of Mary:\n \n \"Christ...was the only Son of Mary, and the Virgin Mary bore no children besides Him... \"brothers\" really means \"cousins\" here, for Holy Writ and the Jews always call cousins brothers.\" \n \n \"He, Christ, our Savior was the real and natural fruit of Mary's virginal womb...This was without the cooperation of a man, and she remained a virgin after that.\"(Sermons on John, chapters 1-4, 1537-39)\n \n One must remember the key point that there was no word for cousins in Aramaic. Therefore, any close relative might be referred to as a brother or sister. Even the King James Bible refers to nephews and uncles as \"brothers\" in the Old Testament. The best explanation I have seen concerning this issue can be found here:\n \n Brothers of Jesus\n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02767a.htm\n \n \nWhile James and the others were not disciples during the time of Jesus' earthly ministry, He appeared to James after the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:4-7).

Are all of the people to which he refers his brothers or the brothers of Jesus in a literal sense? There are 500 brothers in 1 Corinthians 6.\n \n \n James and his younger brother Jude wrote the books of the New Testament that bear their names.

I'm not sure how it relates to the topic at hand. If however, you are attempting to tell me that the Catholic Church has strayed from the true teachings of Christ and is not the Church of Christ then I beg to differ.\n \n When exploring Christianity one should ask himself/herself the following questions:\n \n 1. Did Jesus found a visible church on earth? IF so, which one? Yes, he did, the Catholic Church-Matthew 16:18, Matthew 18:17 (Read MATTHEW 16:18 with reference to MATTHEW 7:24-27 Was Jesus a WISE MAN or a FOOL? Did he establish his church on ROCK or on SAND?)\n \n 2. Did the church have the authority of Jesus? Yes--Matthew 18:17 and 18:18, Matthew 28:18-20, John 20:23, Luke 10:16 \n \n 3. If Jesus established a church and gave it his authority would he let it fall away so soon? No-Matthew 7: 24-27, Matthew 16:18, Matthew 28:20, John 16:13, 1 Timothy 3:15, Ephesians 3:10 (This does not mean that some aspects of the Church or members of the Church did not need reformation. But the Church maintained the revelation of Christ in its fullness unblemished--it did not fall away from the teachings of Christ. A reformation implies a return to form--not a revolution in which an entirely different church and theology is formed).\n \n 4.Would the church Jesus founded be unified, of one mind and one spirit? Or splintered? Unified--John 10:16, John 17:17-23, Ephesians 4:3-6, Philippians 2:2, Romans 12:5\n \n 5. Lastly, if Jesus established a church and you can identify it, as a Christian, should you be a member of it? Should you be willing to follow its teachings knowing that they are the teachings of Christ following from his authority and establishment???? That is, are you willing to trust Jesus and the Church he founded????\n \n Peace.",

Even if we ignore the direct passages that refer to Mary's OTHER CHILDREN, you're actually implying that she never did it with her husband, ever ? As in a virgin when she died ? Do you even realize how incredible a statement that is ?\n \n \n\"Christ...was the only Son of Mary, and the Virgin Mary bore no children besides Him... \"brothers\" really means \"cousins\" here, for Holy Writ and the Jews always call cousins brothers.\"\n \n \n You are misinterpreting the scriptures my friend. I would post suporting verses but I already have above.\n \n \n\"He, Christ, our Savior was the real and natural fruit of Mary's virginal womb...This was without the cooperation of a man, and she remained a virgin after that.\"(Sermons on John, chapters 1-4, 1537-39)\n \n One must remember the key point that there was no word for cousins in Aramaic. Therefore, any close relative might be referred to as a brother or sister. Even the King James Bible refers to nephews and uncles as \"brothers\" in the Old Testament. The best explanation I have seen concerning this issue can be found here:\n \n Brothers of Jesus\n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02767a.htm\n\n \n This is catholic interpretation and traditions and I wont accept it as the Gospel. Nothing here refutes the actual passages in the bible, and in the original language the word brother as used here doesn't connote cousins but siblings.\n \n \nI'm not sure what your point is here. I'm not sure how it relates to the topic at hand. If however, you are attempting to tell me that the Catholic Church has strayed from the true teachings of Christ and is not the Church of Christ then I beg to differ.\n \n When exploring Christianity one should ask himself/herself the following questions:\n \n 1. Did Jesus found a visible church on earth? IF so, which one? Yes, he did, the Catholic Church-Matthew 16:18, Matthew 18:17 (Read MATTHEW 16:18 with reference to MATTHEW 7:24-27 Was Jesus a WISE MAN or a FOOL? Did he establish his church on ROCK or on SAND?)\n \n 2. Did the church have the authority of Jesus? Yes--Matthew 18:17 and 18:18, Matthew 28:18-20, John 20:23, Luke 10:16 \n \n 3. If Jesus established a church and gave it his authority would he let it fall away so soon? No-Matthew 7: 24-27, Matthew 16:18, Matthew 28:20, John 16:13, 1 Timothy 3:15, Ephesians 3:10 (This does not mean that some aspects of the Church or members of the Church did not need reformation. But the Church maintained the revelation of Christ in its fullness unblemished--it did not fall away from the teachings of Christ. A reformation implies a return to form--not a revolution in which an entirely different church and theology is formed).\n \n 4.Would the church Jesus founded be unified, of one mind and one spirit? Or splintered? Unified--John 10:16, John 17:17-23, Ephesians 4:3-6, Philippians 2:2, Romans 12:5\n \n 5. Lastly, if Jesus established a church and you can identify it, as a Christian, should you be a member of it? Should you be willing to follow its teachings knowing that they are the teachings of Christ following from his authority and establishment???? That is, are you willing to trust Jesus and the Church he founded????\n \n Peace.\n\n \n Now ask yourself this, If the church was to be a unified single church which you claim the RCC is that Church, then why in Revelation did Jesus Christ Himself, who authored that book through John, write to the 7 churches that would exist in the last days ? He only should have referred to the one true church. see Rev 2:1-3:22 . I will ask you this though, He does refer to the Catholic Church in one of those seven letters, can you tell me which one is the RCC ?",

Even if we ignore the direct passages that refer to Mary's OTHER CHILDREN, you're actually implying that she never did it with her husband, ever ? As in a virgin when she died ? Do you even realize how incredible a statement that is ?\n\n Did you read what St. Jerome wrote? Or have you discounted him automatically and closed your heart, spirit, and mind to the possibility that this holy man may be right in his presentation of the Revelation of Christ? You may find some interesting points that contradict your view and that support mine using Scripture.\n \n The Church's teaching on the Perpetual Virginity is that she remained a virgin her entire life. The Church says this WITHOUT IGNORING the passages that some people allege state that Mary had other children. She did not have sex with Joseph. Didn't Joseph know that the Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary and enowed her with the Son of God? Would he touch her in light of that? Or would he realize that she was betrothed to God and that he was only a protector and steward of Mary and Jesus? Would Joseph, a faithful Jew, cheat on God? I don't think its an incredible statement to say that Mary was a virgin until she died. We know from Scripture that she was a remarkable woman. \n \n That reminds me of some points that I forgot to ask you about when we started this dialogue concerning the Church wrongfully elevating Mary above other women. I referenced these passages:\n \n \"And he came to her and said, 'Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you!' But she was greatly trouble at the saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be.\" Luke 1:28-29\n \n \"...and she [Elizabeth] exclaimed with a loud cry, 'Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!\" Luke 1:42\n \n \"For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me...\" Luke 1:48\n \n 1. What do you think the angel means when he tells Mary she is \"full of grace?\"\n \n 2. What does Scripture tell us when it says that Mary is \"blessed among women?\"\n \n 3. Do you hold to the Scripture that says \"all generations shall call me blessed?\" Do you consider Mary blessed? Do you ever call her blessed? Do you follow the 4th commandment and honor her as your Mother in Salvation?\n \n \nYou are misinterpreting the scriptures my friend. I would post suporting verses but I already have above.\n\n I am not. Those were Martin Luther's words that I quoted. You must realize that your interpretation that Mary was not a perpetual virgin is the novel view. The oldest, earliest, most accurate, and most reliable view is a belief in the Perpetual Virginity of Mary. Recognize the history of the matter.\n \n \nThis is catholic interpretation and traditions and I wont accept it as the Gospel. Nothing here refutes the actual passages in the bible, and in the original language the word brother as used here doesn't connote cousins but siblings.\n\n This is not Catholic interpretation and Tradition without Scripture. I quote from the passage that I linked at New Advent, \"Now there were only two Apostles named James: James the son of Zebedee, and James the son of Alpheus (Matthew 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:16; Acts 1:13). \" Neither James was the son of Joseph.\n \n And don't forget what I mentioned about Jude not mentioning Jesus as his brother in his epistle...quite odd since he mentioned that James was his brother. Again, I quote the New Advent article, \" Jude is the writer of the last of the Catholic Epistles (Jude 1). He is with good reason identified by Catholic commentators with the \"Judas Jacobi\" (\"Jude the brother of James\" in the Douay Version) of Luke 6:16 and Acts 1:13, otherwise known as Thaddeus (Matthew 10:3; Mark 3:18). It is quite in accordance with Greek custom for a man to be distinguished by the addition of his brother's name instead of his father's, when the brother was better known. That such was the case with Jude is inferred from the title \"the brother of James\", by which he designates himself in his Epistle.\" The better known brother of Jude, if Jesus was his blood brother, was Jesus not James. Jesus takes priority over James so why did Jude not say at the very beginning of his epistle that he was the brother of JESUS?\n \n I don't think you can prove to me that the words used in the Bible definitely refer to Jesus' blood brothers. There was no word for cousin in Aramaic and as I also told you, close kin were often referred to as brethren. \n \n But why should I accept your interpretation of Scripture anyway? Tell me by what means you have been given authority and knowledge to interpret scripture. I think I have read that you believe the Holy Spirit guides everyone when reading scripture. This is very problematic. Look for my next post and I will elaborate on this. Hopefully, you can answer some of the difficult questions I will pose.\n \n Another thing in scripture that strikes me is the fact that when Jesus was lost in the temple around the age of 12 and Joseph and Mary went to find him, there was no mention of any other children. They made no mention of taking other children with them to find him or of leaving their other children with their \"kinsfolk and acquaintances.\" They sought Jesus among their \"kinsfolk and acquaintances\" (Luke 2:44) but they did not seek Jesus among their other children. Was it likely that they would have already had more children in the 12 years after Jesus was born? (Especially before the advent of the birth control pill and other means of regulating births) But there are no mention of other children (Luke 2:41-51) anywhere in the passage.\n \n \nNow ask yourself this, If the church was to be a unified single church which you claim the RCC is that Church, then why in Revelation did Jesus Christ Himself, who authored that book through John, write to the 7 churches that would exist in the last days ? He only should have referred to the one true church. see Rev 2:1-3:22 . I will ask you this though, He does refer to the Catholic Church in one of those seven letters, can you tell me which one is the RCC \n\n Actually, this proves my point. John was calling the churches back to unity and sound doctrine. He was preventing what would later happen in the Reformation. He was telling them that though they were located in different places, all must be united in belief and practice. The Church must be ONE...unified. The Church that displays this unity in belief, doctrine, and practice is the Catholic Church. Protestants, on the other hand, have devolved into over 33,000 denominations with 33,000 versions of the truth. But the truth cannot be divided and splintered.",

Do you believe the Canon of Scripture is infallible? That is, is there anything lacking in Scripture? Are there any books that you would add to the Bible?

If so, then do you acknowledge that the Catholic Church codified these Divinely Inspired books?...not that the Church mandated which were inspired but that it recognized the ones that were truly inspired and discarded others (gnostic gospels, etc.) that were not inspired.\n \n That is, was the Catholic Church sound until the year 397 when the Canon of the Bible was established? (The canon of the Bible was set at the Council of Carthage in 397 with the guidance of St. Augustine (based on the decress of the Coucil of Hippo in 393). This canon was reaffirmed at the second Council of Carthage in 419. This is the Bible that we have today(although other collections of scripture did exist previously)--Protestants and Catholics alike have the same New Testament. \n \n If the Church was sound until then, you have a problem, in that the practices and teachings establishing the Real Presence in the Eucharist, the Sacrifice of the Mass, the Priesthood, Confession, Infant Baptism, the transforming nature of Baptism, etc. were all established prior to that 397 date. Do you conform to those teachings of the Church?\n \n If you don't believe the Church was sound until that date of 397 then you also have a problem. How can you trust that it has given you the correct New Testament? Are you willing to change your New Testament now?

If sola scriptura is the method that should be followed then were a lot of Christians helpless and unable to gain knowledge of God and salvation in the early days? One must consider that the canon of scripture that we all have today was not definitively established until 397 A.D. at the Council of Carthage. There were scripture writings and these writings were read at worship services but there was not a collected work in the form of the Bible. One must also consider that the Bible, once established, was very expensive to obtain because it had to be handwritten. One bible took years to complete, was written on very expensive vellum or parchment, and could cost a year's wages. No one could afford one. Most of the world was illiterate anyway. How was the everyday \"layman\" going to read the Bible with the guidance of the Spirit since the majority of them were illiterate? The people did not have access to the Bible until around the mid 1400s when the printing press was invented. So how are all of the masses to live by the \"Word\" and to obtain their salvation through the teachings of the Bible if 1. There was no bible for almost 400 years after Christ 2. There were no copies of the Bible readily available for 1500 years after Christ 3. If Bibles were available the people were illiterate and couldn't read them? There is only one way to learn Christ's teachings and God's word-through the Church! (Ephesians 3:10)\n \n 4. Using the Catholic/Protestant dispute on the symbolic versus literal meaning of the Real Presence of the Eucharist of John 6 as an example...How does a sola scriptura Christian come up with the symbolic meaning instead of the literal meaning? It seems that there are obviously at least two choices (although one is right and the other wrong). Therefore the Bible can't decide of itself which of its possible meanings are the truth and what was the teaching from the beginning. So some authority--some minister or other authority--entered at some point on the sola scriptura Christian scene and said this is the interpretation we believe and it differs from the interpretation of all Christian history prior to this point. That minister became the authority and at that point sola scriptura falls. And it has fallen so many times with 33,000 protestant denominations out there teaching conflicting sola scriptura doctrines which are really their own traditions.\n \n 5. Leaving out Catholic and Orthodox views altogether...What happens when you have a conflicting view with someone who professes he is a sola scriptura Christian from a different bible-based church then yours yet a \"bible-based\" church nonetheless? How do you resolve the issue? How does the Holy Spirit guide you both when he was already guiding you both? And why did Jesus say take it to the Church in Matthew 18?\n \n 6.
