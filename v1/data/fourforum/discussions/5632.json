   "This article appeared today in Newsday Long Island.\n \n Police: Man critically hurt in bias attack\n \n By Wil Cruz and Rocco Parascandola\n \n \"A Brooklyn porter throwing out the trash was beaten and stomped into a coma by a gang of men who mocked him because they believed he is gay, police said Friday.\n The victim, 28, was in critical condition Friday at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, where his mother, twin sister and other relatives sat vigil while police looked for the suspects, believed to be three to five men who neighbors said deal drugs and belong to a gang.\n ... Police said the victim whose name they did not release because of the nature of the crime, never had a chance against his attackers, who shouted anti-gay remarks during the incident.\n They punched him and threw him to the ground, then kicked him as he slipped into unconsciousness on East 94th Street near Kings Highway in Flatbush, police said.\n Witnesses said the attack, which began at 11.30 p.m. Wednesday, was spaced out over several minutes and became increasingly intense with the final blow a violent kick to the man's head as he lay helpless on the ground.\n Mike Waters, 23, a friend of the victim, was hanging out with another friend when the assult happended. He said he at first thought he was witnessing horseplay between friends, but then \"I saw another person come and kick him in the face,\" adding that the victim \"wasn't breathing or nothing.\"\n Waters and the friend shouted for the men to stop the assult. As the men fled in a dark sedan, the one who kicked the victim in the face turned to Waters' friend and threatened to kill him if he said anything to police, said a resident who called 911.\n At that point, Waters and the friend raced over to the victim and tried to resuscitate him. The victim moaned, but eventually lapsed back into unconsciousness and was rushed to the hospital.\"",

Assault is assault and all crimes are terrible. However, why did the assault take place? That's the reason why I posted this thread. Ignorance had helped to create the incident. I think it's important for People who disliked homosexuals to read information like this. Also, some people don't believe that gay people also face bias attacks. Finally I think it's important for us to understand that people who attack others who are different help to create bias attacks. That's why we must challenge gay prejudice.",

   "Assault is assault - it would be equally horrible if this guy had been beaten for any other reason. This thread is just flame-bait.\n\n \n Agreed, but physical harm is a terrible thing over someone being gay. The perpetrators should be punished to the full extent of the law. \n \n Unfortunately, this is the sort of thing that fuel's the gay lobby's inability/refusal sometimes to separate people who disagree with them about the morality of homosexuality from the isolated instances of people who use violence against gays. (Or when they portray a moral view as 'prejudice' and 'bigotry.') Somewhere at sometime, it'll be used to vilify those who would never do something like this. Remember the preachy P.C. HBO movies that came out about the Matthew Shepard murder? Those things never bother to point out the gulf of difference between an honest moral view that homosexuality is wrong from the intentions and actions of murderers. In fact they sometimes intentionally blur the lines, IMO.\n \n It seems to me that this news story belongs on a hate crimes forum rather than a gay rights forum.",

Hate crimes are the only sort of law that we indict and punish people on matters OTHER than physical evidence, instead using a judgement call. For that reason, I've never thought it was a good idea to punish people for hate. If someone acts on their hate and hurts someone else, they should be punished for the assault or homicide (whichever applies), which can be proven or disproven via physical evidence. But there's no real way to prove 'hate' by physical evidence as hate is an emotion or mental state. (there may be things that can give us indication of it, such as swashtika tatoos, writings of the perpetrator, etc., but even then it still a judgement call of an emotion instead of an event or  action.) And often prosecutors use hate crime laws as a way to further \"throw the book at\" those they are prosecuting, rather than simply trying to curb hate crimes. If there were any real evidence that punishing people for hate did any good to stop hate in this country, I might feel differently, but I've never seen such evidence.\n \n Of course this doesn't mean that I think hate and instances where people act out their hate with violence are ok--that hate still needs to be dealt with in society somehow, perhaps through better education and social awareness. But I tend to agree with Nurglitch; one type of assualt or murder is no better or worse than another, regardless of whether hate is behind it or not. It's still going to cause a great deal of pain and hurt to loved ones and those who are assaulted regardless of the motive behind intentional crimes.",

The motive is considered in just about every case of assault and homicide. We even have different names for different types of homicide: First degree murder, second degree murder, third degree murder, and manslaughter. Each refers to the intent of the murderer. Each of those crimes is punished with a different severity, and it is up to the judge and jury to decide the state of mind of the murderer. In the same fashion, I don't see why it appropriate to punish hate crimes with a different severity. Perhaps, for example, we are presented with two different situations. In the first, a woman finds out her husband is cheating on her and in a rage kills him. In the second, a man finds out his friend is gay, and in a rage kills him. In both cases, we have third degree murder. However, in the first case it is less likely that the murderer is a danger to society, and the woman probably did not have malicious intent. In the second case, the murderer holds a hatred of gay people so strong that he is likely a danger to others. Furthermore, an individual who kills because of sexual orientation has committed a murder due to malicious intent. It is my argument that the second crime is worse than the first, the criminal deserves a greater punishment, and the criminal is a greater danger to society.",

That's why I feel it's sort of indictment that is not based on physical evidence. It seems to me that the problem is that hate has been moved beyond 'motive' in our justice system to a crime in and of itself, which I find troubling.

I think hate crimes are an additional \"crime\". But I don't really think anyone is ever convicted of a hate crime without having actually committed a crime, and the hate crime itself basically acts as additional punishment. I would be fine if hate crime laws simply mandated that anyone committing a hate crime recieves the maximum possible punishment for the crime they have committed.\n \n \nAgain though, that's completely a judgement call and matter of opinion at best.

So given that a serial killer might very well be a greater threat to society due to the fact he kills more people, why should hate crime be more punishable?\n\n \n Well, to put it simply, I do think that a person who commits a hate crime is more likely to kill again than the typical person who killed at random. Certainly we have no way of knowing whether a person who randomly killed another is a serial killer or not, and most often, they are not repeat murderers. If we knew that a murderer was planning on murdering again, then certainly that murderer is every bit as dangerous as someone who committed a hate crime. But realistically, we don't know whether someone who committed a single crime was planning on going on a killing spree. So as far as I can think, the most dangerous motive we might actually be able to brand someone with is that of a hate crime.\n \n Also, in a society where your peers decide your punishment, it is important to be certain that people who murder minorities are not let off easily because the majority disapproves of a particular minority.",

   "I just don't see where the evidence for such a stance comes from.\n\n \n Well, I don't have statistics, the evidences comes only from the hate crimes I've heard of and the reasoning I have provided. The hate crimes I've heard of tend to involve people who wander parks looking for gay people to beat up. Sometimes they involve people who take home gay individuals from bars and kill them, or search them out and kill them. My reasoning is that if hatred for a minority group is the motive for a murder, then the same motive should be present the next time the person who committed the hate comes across a member of that minority group. Furthermore, it seems that with this particular motive, the murderer's motive is perpetual; members of that minority group always exist, the murderer needs only seek them out. This is different from other murders, such as murdering an adulterous husband or a fatal mugging. In those cases, the motive is not perpetually present, and the murderer may never find him or herself in the same situation again.\n \n \nWell, again we aren't so much talking simply about motive as we are a separate class of crime.

I do think, however, that it is important to discourage people from harming someone just because that person is different; hate crimes are very vicious crimes that should be punished to the full extent of our law. If we do not have a law stating that those who commit hate crimes will be punished with the maximum possible sentence for their crime, then I'm glad we have something else to keep those people from getting out of prison.",

They simply killed him because they didn't like the fact he was gay. But that doesn't have anything to do with the gay 'community.' And the idea that hate crimes are usually contagious is certainly unproven. To the 'community' of the victim, it may feel like the group is being targeted when someone perpetrated a hate crime, but that doesn't mean they were truly targeting the community.

Ignorance had helped to create the incident. I think it's important for People who disliked homosexuals to read information like this. Also, some people don't believe that gay people also face bias attacks. Finally I think it's important for us to understand that people who attack others who are different help to create bias attacks. That's why we must challenge gay prejudice.\n\n \n Just curious, How did they know he was gay?",

They drive around with their baseball bats looking for a gay person--ANY gay person--to bash. They usually don't know the person at all; there's no personal motive. They're killing a representative, a symbol of all gay people, and when they find one, they sometimes don't stop there. News of a gay-bashing can intimidate a community for days or weeks unless the perpetrator is quickly caught, because residents realize that no gay person is safe as long as he's on the loose.\n \n By the way, people who kill or beat someone they rob usually don't \"hate\" them--they just want the money and to get away without being caught. Apart from that, it's as pointless to get hung up on the word \"hate\" in \"hate crime\" as it is the \"phobia\" part of \"homophobia.\" They're both terms whose meanings are understood as not confined to the definitions of their components, but which are generally used for want of more precise alternatives.",

   "Most hate crimes are carried out by otherwise law-abiding young people who see little wrong with their actions. Alcohol and drugs sometimes help fuel these crimes, but the main determinant appears to be personal prejudice, a situation that colors people's judgment, blinding the aggressors to the immorality of what they are doing. Such prejudice is most likely rooted in an environment that disdains someone who is \"different\" or sees that difference as threatening. One expression of this prejudice is the perception that society sanctions attacks on certain groups. For example, Dr. Karen Franklin, a forensic psychology fellow at the Washington Institute for Mental Illness Research and Training, has found that, in some settings, offenders perceive that they have societal permission to engage in violence against homosexuals. \n http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/hate/",

   "here is some stuff from the APA.....\n \n When addressing ethnically based hate crimes, the highest rate of crime occurs when nonwhites rapidly move into previously all-white enclaves, said Donald Green, PhD, professor of political science and director of the Institute for Social Policy Studies at Yale University. \"It's not just how white the neighborhood is but also how rapid the changes are,\" he said. Green, who helped train the New Haven, Conn., police department how to deal with hate crimes, says such crimes probably will increase in the suburbs in the next few years as more minorities move there, and it is important for the police to be prepared and respond appropriately. \n \n Victims of hate crimes undergo higher levels of psychological distress, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anger, than victims of other crimes, said Greg Herek, PhD, research psychologist at the University of California, Davis, who spoke on the impact of anti-gay/lesbian victimization at the briefing. Herek, whose research was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, attended the White House conference as APA's representative.\n \n Hate crimes can cause victims to view the world and people in it as malevolent and experience a reduced sense of control, Herek said. According to his research, hate crime victims needed as much as five years to overcome the emotional distress of the incident compared with victims of nonbias crimes, who experienced a drop in crime-related psychological problems within two years of the crime.\n \n \"We need special policies for hate crimes because they have a special impact on the victim and the victim's community,\" Herek added.\n \n http://www.apa.org/monitor/jan98/hate.html",

   "If it were true that people who commit hate crimes kill as much as serial killers (a psychological/pathological profile), then we would have cases where a hate crime killer killed again, and again, and again. I don't know of any such cases myself. (Though they do sometimes kill multiple people at once such as in bombings.) But I definitely know of cases where serial killers go on a killing spree and kill various people over a period of time. I don't know that the case can be made that a serial killer is any MORE dangerous than a hate crime killer, but I also don't think the reverse case can be made either. And for that reason, it doesn't seem to be an equal system if we create a class of crimes called hate crimes punishable in and of themselves that are no more likely to be a danger to society than other crimes. If it could be proven that perpetrators of hate crimes were truly more dangerous than any other dangerous criminals, then that would be a different story. But I don't think that's been proven and I don't think it's provable. So it's a bad idea.\n \n \n \n Well that's a different issue entirely. We're talking about punishment over and above such that they would get for the crime of assault or homicide, not making sure they get equal punishment or that they don't go unpunished.\n\n \n I suppose you see no difference between a person who accidently hits a pedestrian and one who intentionally runs down a minority they disapprove of. emoticon_rolleyes",

Make it affect sentencing and give them a longer sentence for murder or assualt and battery because hate was the motive, but it's silly to create a separate class of crime based on 'hate.'\n \n \n \n If that's truly what it's based on, then it's even more a reason not to have hate crime law, IMO. There's always going to be crimes that cause more damage, and at the least there's no way to say that someone who experiences a hate crime is more 'damaged' than someone who experiences a typical homocide or assault. I don't it's a good idea to go down a road where we say for instance, 'gay people (or whatever the catagory) are more damaged by an assault than someone nearly beaten to death in a mugging', even from a psychological standpoint. Ask the mugging victim and see if he thinks so . . .\n\n \n \n \n You are missing the biggest point, funnt it is the one you didn't comment on.\n \n \n Hate crimes cause more damage than, so they should have a bigger punishment.!!!!!!",

Fear of mugging is real. Once mugged, many people feel insecure for a long, long time. When muggings increase, entire neighborhoods are damaged as people move away or stop going out. It IS the randomness that intensifies the fear. The big difference between a mugging and a gay bashing is that the victim of a mugging can just hand over his wallet or her purse and the perp has gotten what he wants.\n\n \n Fine, then compare it to robbery homicides. \n \n \nHate crimes cause more damage than . . .\n\n \n And I'm saying I don't think you can truly prove that.\n \n \n . . .so they should have a bigger punishment.!!!!!!\n\n \n I told you, I don't disagree with that--I just don't think it's necessary to elevate hate crimes to a separate indictable offense.

   "\n And I'm saying I don't think you can truly prove that.\n \n\n \n Intense feelings of vulnerability, anger, and depression, physical ailments and learning problems, and difficult interpersonal relations-all symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder-can be brought on by a hate crime. \n Dr. Herek and his colleagues found that some hate crime victims have needed as much as 5 years to overcome their ordeal. By contrast, victims of nonbias crimes experienced a decrease in crime-related psychological problems within 2 years of the crime. Like other victims of posttraumatic stress, hate crime victims may heal more quickly when appropriate support and resources are made available soon after the incident occurs. \n http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/hate/\n \n \n Gregory M. Herek, Ph.D. \n Department of Psychology University of California, Davis \n This is a brief summary of preliminary findings from a study of the psychological impact of hate crimes based on sexual orientation, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. With my colleagues, Dr. Jeanine Cogan and Dr. Roy Gillis, I am currently completing a report on these data for publication in a professional journal. \n \n Background. The purpose of the study was to assess the mental health consequences of hate crimes based on sexual orientation. Nearly 2300 gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals from the greater Sacramento (CA) area participated in the research between 1993 and 1996. The sample included roughly equal numbers of men and women, with a median age of 34 years. Research participants completed an extensive questionnaire that included items about their experiences with crime, their attitudes and beliefs about a wide variety of topics, their community involvement, and their psychological well-being. In addition, approximately one-fifth of them were interviewed at length about their experiences. Unless otherwise indicated, this summary focuses on respondents who reported a crime against their person (physical assault, rape, robbery) within the previous 5 years. \n \n Principal Findings. Hate crimes based on sexual orientation appear to have more serious psychological effects on lesbians and gay men than do other crimes. \n \n Level of distress. Lesbian and gay survivors of hate crimes showed significantly more signs of psychological distress - including depression, stress, and anger - than did lesbian and gay survivors of comparable non-bias-motivated crimes. \n Reasons for heightened distress. Much of the distress that we observed among hate crime survivors may result from a heightened sense of personal danger and vulnerability that becomes associated with their identity as a gay man or lesbian. Previous research has shown that all crime victims are likely to feel more vulnerable after their experience and to perceive the world as more dangerous, unpredictable, and hostile. The present data suggest that hate crime victims, in addition, often link this sense of vulnerability and powerlessness to their gay or lesbian identity. This association can be psychologically harmful because sexual orientation is such an important part of the self-concept. \n Duration of distress. The negative effects of hate crimes may be longer lasting than those of other crimes. Hate crime victims continued to have higher levels of depression, stress, and anger for as long as 5 years after their victimization occurred. In contrast, crime-related psychological problems dropped substantially among survivors of non-bias crimes within approximately two years after the crime.\n http://www.apa.org/ppo/issues/pherek.html\n \n \n Hate crime legislation supporters also contend that hate crimes cause the victims more physical and psychological harm than other types of crimes and so the punishment should be greater. According to law professors Bennett Weisburd and Brian Levin, \"Because the violence is so brutal, the degradation so complete and the vulnerability so omnipresent, bias crime victims exhibit greater psychological trauma than nonbias victims.\" \n http://www.enotes.com/hate-crimes/\n \n ----------------------------------------------\n \n Is this enough proof or do you need more?",
