   "I particularly condemn the way our political leaders supplied the manpower for that war. The policies-determiniung who would be drafted and who would be deferred, who would serve and who would escape, who would die and who would live-qwew and antidemocratic disgrace. I can never forgive a leadership that said, in effect: These young men-poorer, less educated, less privileged-are expendable (someone described them as \"economic cannon fodder\"), but the rest are too good to risk. I am angry that so many sons of the powerful and well-placed and so many professional athletes (who were probably healthier than any of us) managed to wangle slots in reserve and National Guard units. Of the many tragedies of Vietnam, this raw class discrimination strikes me as the most damaging to the ideal that all Americans are created equal and owe an equal allegiance to their country. \n \n Colin Powell, My American Journey, p. 148\n\n \n Ouch. \n \n http://www.loper.org/~george/archives/2004/Feb/842.html",

   "O yeah, Powell has been the odd man out in this adminstration ever since 9/11.\n To bad he is Sec of State and can't make policy decisions when it comes to the Defense Dept. He should have been Sec of Defense, but then he wasn't in the Bush (oil) circle.\n \n But about the article. It says that he disagreed with the policies, not with the individuals who took advantage of the policies.\n .",
