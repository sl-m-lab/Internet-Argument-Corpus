   "Wow, it seems like many people in this forum disagree with school uniforms. I've attended public schools (currently go to a public high school) that have uniforms and schools without. Personally I see nothing wrong with them, because I wore T-shirts and jeans throughout middle school and for the majority of high school. I was not interested in make-up and skirts like many other girls, which made me stick out in the crowd at all of my schools. \n \n I won't go as far as to say that uniforms eliminate bullying, because I've got it at every school I've attended. Interestingly enough, I remember that I was bullied a LOT less at the school with uniforms than the one without. Although age could factor, my clothes were a major reason I got bullied at the \"uniform-less\" school. Thirteen-year olds have uniforms all of their own. I think most students at my high school (uniform free) are more concerned with looking like everyone else than expressing themselves with their clothing. People whose styles stand out are the minority. Even the goths who supposedly pride themselves on their individuality tend to look alike. One girl told me, \"This [top] is the style now, which I don't understand because it's not summer and it's not... (pause to think) appropriate.\" She apparently does not feel comfortable showing off her collarbone in mid-September, yet she does because (drum roll) she wants to look like everyone else. No matter what school you go to, you will find a strict uniform policy. Schools who enforce uniforms make it easier.\n \n One could argue that school uniforms are the root of this problem, this girl's urge to look like everyone else. She DID attend a middle school with uniforms; maybe her lack of a backbone can be attributed to the three years she spent at that school. Even though I support uniforms, I think this is a strong counter: forcing kids to wear uniforms as children could create people like this girl who are afraid to stand up for their beliefs. However something else to consider is that her reluctance to stand out could be an adolescent issue. Another thing to consider is that the style she disapproved of was a V-neck with a cami or or tanktop under, showing off the collarbone. The uniforms at her old school were pretty much T-shirts or shirts with collars. Maybe her old uniform taught her modesty--which in itself is another debate.\n \n And on the \"individuality\" tangent, let me share something about many of the kids who attended the middle school with uniforms. The two middle schools I attended (uniform and non-uniform) feed into my current high school. The people who attended a middle school with uniforms are unique, funny, and considered \"wierd\" by students who attended a middle school that only had a dress code policy. My theory is that these kids found other ways of expressing themselves once the principal took away their clothes. However these people contradict the case of that one girl. While she disliked a popular trend and lacked the backbone to stand up for herself, another girl from that same middle school only wears T-shirts and jeans. A good majority of the folks I've gotten to know from that middle school pride themselves on their \"wierd-ness,\" on being different. So having uniforms can have a variety of different effects on students.\n \n Something else to consider is that many businesses have uniforms. Everyone from lawyers at huge law firms to custodians for elementary schools is required to have a uniform.\n \n I'm still thinking about this and considering the two sides of the coin..",
