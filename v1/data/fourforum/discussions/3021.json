Since California law prohibits gay marriage, Mayor Newsom's issuance of marriage licenses for gays violated this order. \n \n Now, with the instance in Oregon. Did you read the article? They stopped issuing marriage licenses until the state determined whether gay marriage was legal or not. They were then forced to resume issuing marriage licenses, and it specifically stated \"officials expect licenses only will be given to marriages between a man and a woman\".

   "Being a woman, black, white, etc cannot be changed. It's genetic. You cannot change that, and it has nothing to do with the way you choose to live your life. One can also point out a woman and a man, and a black person and a white person. One cannot point out a gay. Therefore, all of the things you mention above wouldn't apply to gays. You can't have a restaurant and not allow gays because you can't point out by sight who is gay and who isn't, unlike the ability to point out black and white or male and female.\n \n \n But what you fail to recognize is the fact that indeed gays are picked out. They are picked out by employers, judges, potential land lords or hotel/motel owners. \n Most states actually allow those business and land owners to discriminate based on THEIR PERCEPTION of being gay.\n Court clerks are allowed to discriminate because of a fairly decent inference of a couple which is comprised of two adults of the same gender as being gay. \n \n \n Being gay is a choice.\n \n \n That is an OPINION, not based in fact.\n \n \n Being black isn't.\n\n \n Tell that to Michael Jackson.\n \n \n That's the problem with segregation...we denied the rights of some people because of things they couldn't change, like their color. However, we are not denying gays anything (and they can in fact change).\n\n \n A continuation of your/popular opinion.\n \n \n They have the exact same rights as everyone else. Marrying someone of the same sex is forbidden whether you are gay and straight, and marriage of the opposite sex is legal whether you are gay and straight.\n\n \n There inlies the problem. It's CONVENIENT that those who are straight just happen to be ATTRACTED To members of the opposite gender, and therefore the legallity is simply a matter of CONVENIENCE.\n \n \n Allowing gays to marry other gays is a \"special law\". Why do they deserve this?\n\n \n Because, just like you we are HUMAN BEINGS.\n The CONVENIENCE factor works ONLY in your favor. You are attracted to those of the opposite gender and are allowed to marry a person to whom you are ATTRACTED.\n \n Marriage is and has always been, in this country, a matter of FREE WILL.\n Arranged marriages have NEVER been the NORM in the United States.\n \n Your attraction Freedom fits nicely into the legallity.\n \n Gays on the other hand are NOT allowed to LEGALLY marry those to whom they are ATTRACTED.\n Forsing gays to ONLY marry members of the opposite gender is equivalent to an ARRANGED marriage. This could even be taken as far as to say; ALLOWING gays to marry persons of the OPPOSITE gender, would actually be legalizing federal FRAUD! \n \n \nThe majority doesn't always know what's best. But when they vote, they vote for what they want. And if the majority doesn't want gay marriages, then that will be the result (whether they know if it's best or not).\n\n \n Again, you failed to understand what I was saying in my previous post. \n Again, because you were obviously not paying attention; If the public had been ALLOWED to vote on the Right Of Women to Vote, they would still not be allowed to do so.\n \n If the public had been ALLOWED to vote on the issue of Interracial Marriage, it would still not be ALLOWED.\n \n If the public had been ALLOWED to vote on desegragation, it would never have happened.\n \n These matters are NOT something that should ever be allowed to be left up to the public. Civil Rights issues are ABOVE the basic understanding of most individuals. Legalized Discrimination is not something our nation should EVER be allowed to CHOOSE.",
