I would think you could come up with a more rational argument for rejecting EDO's evidence for his claim. You know as well as I do that hippos don't have plates lined down the length of their backs as Stegs do. And nothing about that pictograph resembles a hippo. It also begs the question about how primitive men with no archeological or paleontologic knowledge could have hewn an accurate rendition of a creature into the stone that became extinct sixty some od million years ago. WEIRD HUH ? And the age of the ruins it was found in have been confirmed and established I believe.\n \n http://www.bible.ca/tracks/tracks-cambodia-stegasarus.jpg\n \n Notice the downward sloping head with the upward swinging plate at the very top of the forehead as only a stegasarus had. And have you ever seen a hippo with a tail that long ? I think not. No hippo, and neither can it be a Rhino as it has no cone shaped horn protruding upward from above its snout. So how does a pictograph of a long extinct creature show up on ruins from the 12th century ? That is the question for debate. Is it possible that there are realities in our past that we just aren't aware of with our current level of understanding ? I believe there are, and many. \n \n And just mocking EDO and scoffing that the suggestion is crazy isn't a response to the photographic evidence that approximately 800 years ago some primitive artisan cut an allegedly long extinct animal into a wall for this generation to see and recognize for the type of animal and classification it belongs to.",

Until such evidence arises (and I suspect that it will not) there is no way a carving will convince me, in much the same way that, if someone showed me a very convincing picture of a car from 1000 years ago, I would look for another explanation than a very precocious inventor or time travel.\n \n You understand? The paleontological evidence is so mountainous, and so self-consistent that a carving of an exotic-looking reptilian, while puzzling, does not, for me, ask the question \"Is this a dinosaur?\" It asks the questions \"What could this reptilian creature be?\" and also, particularly, \"Does this carving even represent a real creature?\" I know nothing of early SE asian culture, but it is quite possible that this is a mythological beastie or a large lizard that is not a dinosaur but is nevertheless extinct.

   "From the Enchanted Learning site: \nANATOMY\n \n Photo courtesy of Jim Puckett, using a new Olympus 3040 digital camera taken in the Dinosaur Hall of \"Prehistoric Journey\" at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.\n Stegosaurus was up to 26-30 feet long (8-9 m), about 9 feet tall (2.75 m), and weighed about 6,800 pounds (3100 kg). Its small brain was only the size of a walnut (weighing roughly 2.5 - 2.9 ounces (70 - 80 grams). Its skull was long. pointed, and narrow; it had a toothless beak and small cheek teeth. Its head was carried close to the ground, probably no more than 3 feet (1 m) high.\n\n Every picture I've seen of a stegosaurus shows the same long, lean skull. Quite different from the square rhino head in the carving. Perhaps 1000 years ago a living example of a brand new species of stegosaur was found.

   "This thread really puts the 'fun' in 'fundie science'!\n\n \n Glad to help, now let's get serious...\n \n \nNO! NO! NO!\n \n You don't *need* to base anything on one piece of evidence unless that piece of evidence be that there are certain physical laws. If these physical laws *aren't* the case then we're pretty much screwed on knowing anything including whether the world really exists, Bible and all, and whether we're actually having this conversation at all.\n\n \n Not true at all Otto. The misinterpretation of data surrounding our origins, the age of the Earth, the Universe etc. etc. needn't change the basic facts that we have discovered at all. I don't deny that Dinos existed at all. But I deny that Dino Fossils can reasonably be expected to have survived from 65 to 350 million years while at the VERY SAME TIME scientists are unable to discover a cadre of fossil evidence that is between the age of 5000 and 50,000 years young. Why didn't the younger fossils survive enmasse while the older ones are everywhere ? In great Flood debates right on this forum by your own allies it has been argued that no fossil evidence of a Worldwide flood exists. I say that at the level of strata that the most fossils are found at and attributed to the event of 65 million years ago is actually the event of the Great Flood which has been misunderstood by science.\n \n I suggest to you that the alleged older fossil record is really the younger evidence that has ALWAYS been misinterpreted by evos. \n \n \nYou can correlate data from different methods of dating. Let's say radioactive decay rates were different in the past. Why have their rates all changed in lock-step so that they're all proportionatly the same today? How come we can correlate carbon dating with dendrochronology? Why do rates of deposition and erosion appear to correlate with the timescales we're looking at here.\n\n \n Again, the inventors of these technologies has every motivation to base their accuracy on results that reflect ages in the multiple millions of years of fossils. And those scientists who test and use such devices would send back as defective any device that reflected ages of T-Rex for example 5 to 50,000 years old. So it is the preconceived notions within the scientific community that determines the ages of fossils, not the devices they use to confirm their findings.\n \n I'm not even insisting that the Radiometric and Radiocarbon devices that have been invented can't be valid technology that can actually work. What I'm saying is these machines are still calibrated by men who have preconceived notions as to the acceptable outcomes, and have all heard about how every new technology that originally came out with much younger numbers than were expected were redesigned and re-calibrated to reflect the expected outcome before they were considered reliable and accepted by scientists in the field. \n \n \nBTW even if that *was* an actual stegosauraus, so what? Theoretically it would be possible for a stegosaurus population to have survived until historical times. It's unlikely. It isn't the most likely explanation for that carving, but it *could* have happened. That hardly represents good evidence for the YEC case.\n\n \n In addition to all of the other historical records of sightings around the World from diverse and numerous Societies that had no contact or knowledge of the others existence over that past 2000 years, it is not only likely but very probable that man has coexisted with Dinos and they weren't wiped out by a major event 65 million years ago at all, but were hunted to extinction by our very own ancestors. \n \n This would explain the voluminous amounts of evidence from around the World in pictorial depictions by innumerable societies that these creatures were real to them and not mythical in any way. I mean, common sense should tell us that primitive man had no means by which to accurately portray, draw, depict or recreate an accurate rendition of creatures they had absolutely no reason to believe ever existed at all if they had been extinct for 65 million years or so. \n \n Trust your ability to reason and deduce rationally rather than place your faith in machines that are created and used by people who without doubt have a huge personal investment in the outcomes they claim to support. And just ask these questions I'm asking. Make no claims, but ask for answers to these questions that the powers that be in these sciences insist you must never even ask. Why must we not ask questions that conflict with the known alleged evidence they are asking us to take on faith ? Ask yourself that question if the evidence they put forth is so strong.",

   "Here Otto, I'm not the only one who believes as I do regarding your dating methods and their reliability. Here's an excerpt and the link.\n \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v17/i3/pigs.asp\n \n The pigs took it all\n \n by Marvin L. Lubenow\n A popular myth is that radioactive dating methods confirm the geologic time-scale and the concept of human evolution. The methods appear so impressive that many Christians accept them as evidence that the earth is very old. The best way to expose this myth is to study the dating of the East African KBS Tuff strata and the famous fossil KNM-ER 1470.1\n Richard Leakey, son of famed palaeoanthropologists Louis and Mary Leakey, visited the fossil deposits east of Lake Rudolf (now Lake Turkana) in northern Kenya in 1967. He immediately organized an expedition to search for hominid fossils.\n The most important fossil discovered there is KNM-ER 1470. Skull 1470 is modern in appearance, but was originally estimated by Richard Leakey to be about 2.9 million years old.\n One early geologist with Richard Leakey at East Rudolf was Kay Behrensmeyer. Seeking to unravel the geology of the area, she discovered a layer of volcanic ash or tuff that became known as the Kay Behrensmeyer Site (the KBS Tuff).\n If the KBS Tuff were anywhere else, no one would give it a second thought. At East Rudolf it is of utmost importance. First, although human fossils and artefacts (tools) cannot usually be dated radiometrically, the KBS Tuff can. It contains radioactive potassium 40, which decays to argon 40. Second, artefacts have been found in association with the KBS Tuff. The assumption is that the tuff gives an estimate of the age of the stone tools. Third, hundreds of Homo and australopithecine fossils have been found above and below the KBS Tuff. The date of the tuff thus becomes a maximum age for fossils found above it and a minimum for fossils below it.\n The first attempt to date the KBS Tuff was in 1969, well before the discovery of skull 1470. Richard Leakey supplied rock samples to F.J. Fitch (Birkbeck College, University of London) and J.A. Miller (Cambridge University) - recognized authorities in potassium-argon (K-Ar) dating.\n Fitch and Miller's first analysis gave evolutionary dates from 212 million to 230 million years of age. Concerning this they said, 'From these results it was clear that an extraneous argon age discrepancy was present ...'.2 How did they know? The associated fossils told them. In spite of our being assured that dating methods constitute independent confirmation of evolutionary dates, associated fossils had already determined the 'acceptable' dates. Based on their alleged evolution, the australopithecine and other mammalian fossils found beneath the KBS Tuff had determined that the rocks should be between 2 and 5 million years old.\n Dates of 212 to 230 million years old were far off. Without the associated fossils, however, there would be no way for an evolutionary geologist to know if these were 'good' or 'bad' dates. Under other circumstances, and without fossils to guide them, evolutionary geologists could have accepted these dates as 'good'.\n Fitch and Miller requested new samples. From these they concluded from pumice lumps and feldspar crystals that the age of the KBS Tuff was 2.61 million years.3 It was because Leakey found skull 1470 below this tuff after it had been dated at 2.61 million years and above rock dated at 3.18 million years that he estimated the skull to be 2.9 million years old.\n DATING PIGS AND ELEPHANTS\n In 1972, before skull 1470 was announced, Vincent Maglio (Princeton University) published in Nature a chronology of the hominid-bearing sediments east of Lake Rudolf, which included the KBS Tuff.4 His work was based on lineages of two species of pig and one of elephant. Maglio's dates were compatible with the radiometric date arrived at by Fitch and Miller, and were considered to confirm their date.\n In 1974, a third chronology of the area was published in Nature, based on palaeomagnetism.5 The conclusion of 2.7 to 3.0 million years seemed to represent a 'bulls-eye' for the correlation of the various dating methods.6\n By late 1974, the KBS Tuff had been dated five different times by four different dating methods. The alleged compatibility of the different methods would seem to be a geologist's dream.\n However, under the surface, skull 1470 with its estimated date of 2.9 million years presented the evolutionary world with an intolerable situation. The theory of human evolution did not allow a skull so modern to be that old. Nevertheless Richard Leakey continued to fight for this original date. If skull 1470 was 2.9 million years old, he had discovered the oldest member of the genus Homo; if it wasn't, he hadn't! Hence, he resisted lowering the age of the skull.\n Meanwhile, another study by G.H. Curtis and his associates (University of California, Berkeley) claimed to distinguish two tuff units. One gave an age of 1.6 million years and the other, where skull 1470 was found, gave 1.82 million years - both considerably younger than the five previous studies had reported.\n All of the above-cited articles spoke of the great difficulty in getting rock or crystal samples that were not altered, weathered, or derived from older rock. The question arises, How does one know when one has good samples for dating? The answer is that 'good' samples give dates in accord with evolutionary presuppositions. 'Bad' samples give dates not in conformity with evolution - a classic illustration of circular reasoning.\n On March 20, 1980, two more dating studies in Nature criticized the earlier work and claimed that the age of the KBS Tuff was 1.87 or 1.89 million years. Then in late 1981, Ian McDougall published his study of the KBS Tuff, giving a date of 1.88 million years. At that point, the 10-year controversy over the date of the KBS Tuff came to a close with agreement on the more recent date.\n \n And here's a more in depth link with additional findings and evidence.\n \n http://earthage.org/EarthOldorYoung/Radiometric%20Dating,%20and%20The%20Age%20of%20the%20Earth.htm",

Some dinosaur relatives preserved in this Chinle assemblage belong to groups previously known only from the Middle and lowermost Upper Triassic outside North America.

By using sensitive molecular techniques, we now demonstrate a much greater range of detectable organisms; from 2000- and 4000-year-old ice-core samples, we obtained and characterized 120 clones that represent at least 57 distinct taxa and reveal a diversity of fungi, plants, algae, and protists.

But this core deals with weather patterns, not life as the first example I posted about Ice Cores.\n \n Record ice core gives fair forecast\n 18:00 09 June 2004\n NewScientist.com news service\n Fred Pearce\n \n As long as humans do not mess it up, the Earth's climate is set at fair for the next 15,000 years. That is according to information extracted from the oldest ice core ever drilled.\n \n The Antarctic core is the first to reach as far back as a warm period with characteristics similar to our own interglacial. So it should help make more accurate predictions about when to expect the next deep freeze.\n \n The ice core, drilled from a feature in central Antarctica called Dome C, is around 3 kilometres long and 10 centimetres wide. Changes in the relative proportions of hydrogen isotopes in the ice layers allow scientists to compile a complete record of Antarctic temperatures going back 740,000 years.\n \n The core shows the waxing and waning of eight ice ages. Most critically for making predictions about our climate, it is the first core to record a period known as Termination V, around 430,000 years ago.\n \n Warming pattern\n \n At this point, the world moved from a glacial period into a long, warm interglacial, similar to this era.

I was speaking of an example like this. But this core deals with weather patterns, not life as the first example I posted about Ice Cores.\n\n \n No you didn't, here's what you posted -\n \n \nInteresting, they have Ice Cores that are only between 2000 and 4000 years old. Where's the Ancient ICE ? I mean if we suffered a type of Nuclear Winter 65 million years ago due to Asteroid that destroyed the Dinos, surely some of that Ice lay beneath the surface.\n\n \n What am I to infer or understand based on the underlined?

That is according to information extracted from the oldest ice core ever drilled.\n \n The Antarctic core is the first to reach as far back as a warm period with characteristics similar to our own interglacial. So it should help make more accurate predictions about when to expect the next deep freeze.\n \n The ice core, drilled from a feature in central Antarctica called Dome C, is around 3 kilometres long and 10 centimetres wide. Changes in the relative proportions of hydrogen isotopes in the ice layers allow scientists to compile a complete record of Antarctic temperatures going back 740,000 years.\n \n The core shows the waxing and waning of eight ice ages. Most critically for making predictions about our climate, it is the first core to record a period known as Termination V, around 430,000 years ago.\n \n Warming pattern\n \n At this point, the world moved from a glacial period into a long, warm interglacial, similar to this era. The previous longest ice-core record, drilled by the Soviet Union at Vostok in Antarctica between 1980 and 1988, went back only 420,000 years.\n \n \"All interglacials are slightly different, but we believe Termination V is the most similar to our own,\" says chief author of the new study, Eric Wolff, at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK.

Although an elephant or hippopotamus can eat grass (or lie in a covert of reeds and marsh), neither an elephant or a hippopotamus has a \"tail like a cedar\" (that is, a tail like a large, tapered tree trunk). In your kid's dinosaur book you will find lots of animals that have \"tails like a cedar.\"\n \n Leviathan has the following attributes according to Job chapter 41, Psalm 104:25,26 and Isaiah 27:1. This is only a partial listing-just enough to make the point.\n \n \"No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up.\"\n \"Who can open the doors of his face, with his terrible teeth all around?\"\n \"His rows of scales are his pride, shut up tightly as with a seal; one is so near another that no air can come between them; they are joined one to another, they stick together and cannot be parted.\"\n \"His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. Out of his mouth go burning lights; sparks of fire shoot out. Smoke goes out of his nostrils, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes.

He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood. The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones become like stubble to him. Darts are regarded as straw; he laughs at the threat of javelins.\"\n \"On earth there is nothing like him, which is made without fear.\"\n Leviathan \"played\" in the \"great and wide sea\" (a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26-get the exact sense by reading them yourself).\n Leviathan is a \"reptile [a] that is in the sea.\" (Isaiah 27:1)\n [a] Note: The word translated \"reptile\" here is the Hebrew word tanniyn. This shows that \"Leviathan\" was also a \"tanniyn\" (dragon).\n \n Unlike behemoth, who is huge, Leviathan is ferocious and terrifying. Many references (we have not listed them all) refer to the sea, so Leviathan is probably a sea creature. Although some bibles refer to Leviathan as an alligator or crocodile (and both of these are fierce) neither of these is a sea creature. They like the water, but they spend much of their time on land. Further, the question \"Who can open the doors of his face. . . .\" implies that nobody can open Leviathan's jaws. Although an alligator's jaws cannot normally be forced open, a punch to their sensitive snout or poke in eye might startle them enough to release their grip.[2] Although this is a good description of an alligator characteristic, it does not fit perfectly with the description of Leviathan, which in the context of the Bible was supposed to describe an essentially impossible event, and we are not done yet.\n \n The description of the scales is interesting. Several verses describe these great scales. Compared to Leviathan's armor, iron is like straw and arrows ca not make it flee. Let's face it, an arrow can do a lot of damage to a crocodile or alligator. This is not a description of either of them-or any living animal we are aware of.\n \n And now for the key ingredient: fire. It is hard to read Job 41:18-21 without realizing the Bible is telling us that Leviathan breathes fire. That alone will eliminate almost every living animal. Yes, there is one animal like that in today's world. It is called a bombardier beetle. This beetle is a native of Central America, and has a nozzle in its hind end that acts like a little flame thrower. It sprays a high-temperature jet of gas (fueled by hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide with oxidative enzymes) for protection. Now, if a Central American beetle can do it, so could Leviathan. By the way, crocodiles and alligators are out of the picture on this one, don't you agree?\n \n Before we leave the topic of fire, there are two more notes you may find interesting:\n \n The history of every culture is filled with stories of fire-breathing dragons. If you think about it, in all the past ages wouldn't someone have made up a story of a fire-breathing lion or something? Nobody did because the dragon stories are based on truth, and only \"dragons\" breathed fire. It is easy to imagine Leviathan as a member of the dragon (tanniyn) family. (Plus, Isaiah 27:1 strongly implies this connection.)\n Many fossil dinosaur skulls contain unexplained, empty passages. Scientists have not been able to guess the reason for these passages. Would it make sense that some dinosaurs used these passages as \"gas tanks\" for the combustible mixture used to \"breathe fire?\" We believe it does.\n Comparing all this information to the description in your kid's dinosaur book, you may come up with the conclusion that Leviathan is a kronosaurus. We have heard (and read) other suggestions, but the kronosaurus is the best match of any known creature to the description of Leviathan.",

At least it gives me something to laugh about.\n[/QUOTE]\n \n Sea Serpents of Canada \n By Charles Alexander Moffat\n Unbeknownst to many Canadians and foreigners, Canada actually has an abundancy of sea-serpent/dragon myths, otherwise known as \"Loch Ness Monsters\". Like their Scottish relative, these Canadian sea serpents dwell in coastal waters and inland lakes. It is widely believed that if these sea serpents exist, then they are actually dinosaurs that somehow avoided the mass extinctions of the Cretaceous Period.\n In the case of Canadian Sea-Serpents, the native myths and legends about them have existed for thousands of years. Recorded sightings of such creatures date back to the 1700s.\n \n Jacques Cartier, the French explorer who mapped much of the St. Lawrence river, kept a journal of everything he did. He and members of his crew saw what they described as \"a giant finned snake\" that moved like a caterpillar, using its side fins to propel itself forward in the water. Cartier's crew tried to capture the beast, but it moved too quickly and dove beneath the waters.\n \n When Cartier consulted with natives in the region, they called the creature \"Gaasyendietha\". This was the first recorded sighting of any sea serpent in North America.\n \n But it would not be the last. Across Canada and the United states, there are numerous large lakes (most notably the Great Lakes, which was an inland sea during the last ice age) and a variety of sea-serpent myths to go with them.\n \n \n Gaasyendietha:\n \n According to Seneca myths, Gaasyendietha is said to be a dragon that dwells in Lake Ontario. Although it is seldom described, it is said to be quite large. Legends say this dragon could fly on a trail of fire, and it could also spew fire.\n \n Argont:\n \n According to Huron myths, Angont is a vicious, poisonous reptile who supposedly dwelled in desolate places such as caves, forests, lakes in the Lake Ontario/Lake Erie region. Its skin is poisonous, walks on four legs (very similar to a Komodo dragon from China) and is approximately the size or a horse or donkey. Legends say it also causes disasters and diseases.\n \n Amhuluk:\n \n Amhuluk supposedly lives in a lake in British Columbia or perhaps as far south as Oregon (there are multiple locations and sightings of Amhuluk). The most celebrated location is near Forkend Mountain in Oregon, where native americans greatly fear the beast. It is described as a very large sea serpent with horns.\n \n One story accounts how Amhuluk impaled two of three children on its horns and took them into the lake. The father visited these children, and for five days they appeared by the water. However, afterward, they disappeared and remained with Amhuluk. Many believe that this dragon's passion is to catch and drown things. The story is likely meant to scare children away from swimming in the lakes.\n \n Ancient Serpent:\n \n According to Piute myth, the Ancient Serpent lived in the Lake Pyramid and reportedly like to snatch victims. When the Piutes saw whirlpools in Lake Pyramid, they would not go near the lake, for they were afraid that the Ancient One was looking for another victim to snatch.\n \n The Bentinck Sea Serpent:\n \n Not actually a sea serpent, this endangered species is actually a very large snake, comparable to an anaconda. It is found in Bentinck township in Grey County, Ontario. It is a very large black snake that inhabits swamp areas, feeding on fish and other aquatic life. The largest Bentinck Black Snake ever found was thirty feet long, and was found in 1955.\n \n Kolowisi:\n \n The Zuni myths tell of Kolowisi, a huge water serpent with fins along its body, and small horns. One of the tales involves a young girl who goes to a spring. There, she found a small baby there and rescued it from the water. Without telling her parents, she took the baby and slept with it by her side.\n \n The \"baby\" was really Kolowisi, who then transformed into his true shape. He stole the girl and took her back to the spring. There, he made her his wife.\n \n In another story, however, Kolowisi held back the flood waters for a family to get up the mountain. By doing this, Kolowisi allowed these people to live, and then allowed the flood waters to fill the valley.\n \n \n Msi-Kinepeikwa:\n \n Sometimes called just \"Kinepikwa\", this dragon/serpent was a Shawnee myth. It was described as being a large serpent, much like a snake, that inhabited a lake. The Msi-Kinepeikwa achieved its form slowly. This massive serpent shed its skin and grew the next, growing larger each time. It is said that the first stage of this creature was a fawn with one red and one blue horn which was inside of a lake. This fawn grew and moved toward the water's edge, changing and growing until it became the serpent that the natives saw.\n \n Palulukon:\n \n The Hopi believe that hue water serpents with large plumes, and are revered as nature spirits, believed to be able to cause natural disasters when angered or hurt.\n \n The Spoonville Beach Sea Serpent:\n \n The Spoonville story appears to be one built by tourists and local area residents, in an effort to boost tourism. Descriptions of the beast sound more like a traditional dragon story, and may be completely fictionalized. There is no native myth about a sea serpent in that region, suggesting that this is just fabrication. The sea serpent is described as a huge creature with red, bloodshot eyes. The scales were said to be green, and smoke was said to billow out of its nostrils.\n \n Gloucester's Sea Serpent:\n \n On August 22, 1817, a publication in Boston entitled \"A Monsterous Sea Serpent: The largest ever seen in America\" was published. It reported a sea serpent that appeared in the harbor to be about forty-five to fifty-five feet in length with a head similar to a horse. Other sightings of the creature reported up to one hundred feet long and that the head was more snake-like.\n \n In Massachusetts, literally hundreds of people saw this creature. So many saw this sea monster that the government was forced to investigate. The Linnaean Society of New England created a special committee to investigate. Members included the judge John Davis, the doctor Jacob Bigelow, and the naturalist Francis Gray.\n \n According to hundreds of reports, it moved like a caterpillar, had a neck as thick as a barrel and approximately 45 to 100 feet long.\n \n \n Stvkwvnaya:\n \n Also called the \"Tie Snake\". According to the Seminole, it is reputed to have a single horn, which is said to be an aphrodisiac. It is described as being at least the size of a horse, and at least 20' in length, with 4 fins on its sides.\n \n There are many more legends and sightings across North America, such Ogopogo in British Columbia, and the Lake Champlain sea serpent in Pennsylvania. I am not listing all of them on here.\n \n Sea serpent legends/sightings are only found in temperate parts of Canada and the United States. When they are sighted, most people don't even know the proper name of the creature because they didn't even know that the region had a sea serpent myth.\n \n Most police forces do not keep track of such sightings either, firmly believing that people are just pulling their legs.\n \n It would be difficult to tell just how many sightings occur per year, because most people likely don't report the sightings, and even if they did, most authorities wouldn't even bother to write up a report. They have murderers and rapists to worry about. Tracking down a so-called sea serpent, which may or may not be a prank, is considered to be a waste of time.\n \n And even if they did find one, it would most certainly be an endangered species, likely eat fresh-water fish, and is nothing much to worry about.\n \n It is important to note that this planet has many unusual creatures that we don't learn about in grade school. Schools tend to teach animals that fit into the ABCs (A is for Anteater, B is for Bird, C is for Cat, etc). The Komodo dragon (a poisonous reptile about the size of a horse) and 50' long giant squids are real creatures, but they are rarely ever seen. No one has ever made a high-quality photo of \"big-foot\" and sasquatches, but we know they exist because we have fossils of them (in the scientific community, the fossils are known as homo gigantus).\n \n We know that sea-serpent-ish dinosaurs did once exist, because we have fossils of them. We also know from these fossils that they ate fish.\n \n We even have one preserved \"sea serpent\" that was found in the nets of a Portuguese fishing boat off the coast of Newfoundland in 1989. It was partially decomposed, and is believed to either have been hit by a passing ship (its fins were torn badly) or it had been preserved in ice for millions of years and had only recently melted.\n \n Every religion has flood myths, and they also have some form of sea serpent/dragon myth, including the bible. Either these religions made up these myths to explain the bones of dinosaurs, or people have actually sighted such creatures.\n \n And like every good fish story, the tale tends to get longer and more impressive with the telling. Before you know it the lowly sea serpent has sprouted wings and can spit fire.",

   "To be looked down upon by a XXXXX isn't such a bad thing snakepit. In fact one gets used to it when dealing with small minded people.\n\n I normally would take offense to someone calling me a small minded XXXXX, but in your case I will consider the source (someone attempting to make the rediculous argument that dinosaurs lived together with man, that fire breathing dragons exist or ever did exist, that MYTHS of sea serpents prove that dinosaurs and man coexisted, etc etc etc), and I will simply smile and nod. \n \n \nNow what are you going to say when I produce descriptions of Dinos in the bible snakepit, and even Dragons ?\n\n How about<b></b>: \"My, what a vivid imagination you have!\"\n \n \nHow loud will you scoff then ? And mock and insult me rather than accept that it describes them.\n\n I am not so much attempting to mock or insult you, rather the rediculous notion that dinosaurs walked with man. I can't help the little snicker that comes out every time I think that people actually believe this stuff, and will bend the word of their own spritual book to prove it. Even most christians find the irrational claims of new earth creationists to be a distasteful twisting of the bibles words. But hey, you hav every right to believe whatever you want. Don't mind the occasional bouts of uncontrollable laughter from the rest of the world. I guess that is just your cross to bear.\n \n \n The word Dinosaur didn't exist until the 19th Century so it isn't in the bible but explain these descriptions if you can. See Behemoths, Leviathans and Tanniyn (Dragon) as described in the bible.\n\n Then why would the bible not now use the word Dinosaur? I mean come on, it's translations over the years have changed so greatly, you would think that there would be a lot of mention of dinosaurs in the bible, since it would bolster the thoery of creationism. Yet the majority of christianity will not touch that one with a 10ft pole. Odd. The ambiguous language of \"behemoths, leviathans, and tanniyn\" is used, who's translations vary greatly from text to text. Sure, with a great deal of imagination, you can make it sound like just about anything you want it to. \n \n \n Behemoth has the following attributes according to Job 40:15-24\n \n \"He lies under the lotus trees,\n In a covert of reeds and marsh.\"\n\n I would love to see a Brachiosaurus or Apatosaurus lie under a lotus tree, or hide amongst the reeds and marsh. Sure. That would be akin to hiding an elephant under a christmas tree.\n \n \nLeviathan has the following attributes according to Job chapter 41, Psalm 104:25,26 and Isaiah 27:1. This is only a partial listing-just enough to make the point.\n \n \"No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up.\"\n \"Who can open the doors of his face, with his terrible teeth all around?\"\n \"His rows of scales are his pride, shut up tightly as with a seal; one is so near another that no air can come between them; they are joined one to another, they stick together and cannot be parted.\"\n \"His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. Out of his mouth go burning lights; sparks of fire shoot out. Smoke goes out of his nostrils, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes. His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.\"\n \"Though the sword reaches him, it cannot avail; nor does spear, dart, or javelin. He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood. The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones become like stubble to him. Darts are regarded as straw; he laughs at the threat of javelins.\"\n \"On earth there is nothing like him, which is made without fear.\"\n Leviathan \"played\" in the \"great and wide sea\" (a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26-get the exact sense by reading them yourself).\n Leviathan is a \"reptile [a] that is in the sea.\" (Isaiah 27:1)\n\n Sounds like a crocodile to me.\n \n As for psalm 104:\n \n 25. This sea-great and wide; there are creeping things and innumerable beasts, both small and large.\n 26. There the ships go; You formed this leviathan with which to sport.\n What about this says \"giant fire breathing sea dragon\"?\n \n \nUnlike behemoth, who is huge, Leviathan is ferocious and terrifying. Many references (we have not listed them all) refer to the sea, so Leviathan is probably a sea creature. Although some bibles refer to Leviathan as an alligator or crocodile (and both of these are fierce) neither of these is a sea creature. They like the water, but they spend much of their time on land.\n\n The saltwater crocodile is able to travel a great distance over open sea. Their great distribution is probably due to this trait.\n \n The saltwater crocodile can be found in coastal waters between Northern Australia and the southern coast of India. They can also be found in freshwater rivers and swamps.\n \n http://www.thebigzoo.com/Animals/Saltwater_Crocodile.asp\n \n \n Further, the question \"Who can open the doors of his face. . . .\" implies that nobody can open Leviathan's jaws. Although an alligator's jaws cannot normally be forced open, a punch to their sensitive snout or poke in eye might startle them enough to release their grip.[2] Although this is a good description of an alligator characteristic, it does not fit perfectly with the description of Leviathan, which in the context of the Bible was supposed to describe an essentially impossible event, and we are not done yet.\n\n The saltwater crocodile is the largest crocodilian and the largest living reptile. Male saltwater crocodiles can reach lengths of 23 feet and females reach lengths of over 10 feet. They have a very large head and very strong jaws. \n You go pry open the jaws of a saltwater croc, even try punching it in the nose first. Don't cry to me when you pull away a bloody stump if you even live. \n \n \nThe description of the scales is interesting. Several verses describe these great scales. Compared to Leviathan's armor, iron is like straw and arrows ca not make it flee. Let's face it, an arrow can do a lot of damage to a crocodile or alligator. This is not a description of either of them-or any living animal we are aware of.\n\n \n In Taiwan, a man whose arm was bitten off by a crocodile has had it surgically reattached. The veterinarian was trying to treat a 440-pound Nile crocodile. The animal, apparently, wasn't tranquilized enough. Another zoo worker shot the crocodile to get it to let go of the veterinarian's arm. Zoo officials said the crocodile is all right. The bullets did not penetrate his skin. \n  http://www.nbc5.com/news/11856998/detail.html\n \n \nAnd now for the key ingredient: fire. It is hard to read Job 41:18-21 without realizing the Bible is telling us that Leviathan breathes fire. That alone will eliminate almost every living animal. Yes, there is one animal like that in today's world. It is called a bombardier beetle. This beetle is a native of Central America, and has a nozzle in its hind end that acts like a little flame thrower. It sprays a high-temperature jet of gas (fueled by hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide with oxidative enzymes) for protection. Now, if a Central American beetle can do it, so could Leviathan. By the way, crocodiles and alligators are out of the picture on this one, don't you agree?\n\n Actually, it does not shoot fire. It is not a \"flamethrower\". It shoots a high pressure jet of water and 3 chemicals mixed together, that creates a pressure jet of basically hot water and steam. There is no flame involved. \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v17/i1/beetle.asp\n A beetle that shoots a pressure jet of steaming chemicals proves fire breathing dragons? I think not. You're reaching...and falling far short.\n \n \nBefore we leave the topic of fire, there are two more notes you may find interesting:\n \n The history of every culture is filled with stories of fire-breathing dragons. If you think about it, in all the past ages wouldn't someone have made up a story of a fire-breathing lion or something? Nobody did because the dragon stories are based on truth, and only \"dragons\" breathed fire.\n \n Probably because lions are something that many people had seen at the time, and knew for a fact that they did not breathe fire. A dragon on the other hand, was mythical creature that adventurers and story tellers could protray as they wished in their songs and stories. Making it breathe fire certainly makes it more interesting and exciting than a dragon that just walks around eating animals all day long. You don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.\n \n \nMany fossil dinosaur skulls contain unexplained, empty passages. Scientists have not been able to guess the reason for these passages. Would it make sense that some dinosaurs used these passages as \"gas tanks\" for the combustible mixture used to \"breathe fire?\" We believe it does.\n\n Or possibly, oh, I don't know...maybe sinus passages? Who would think?\n \n \nComparing all this information to the description in your kid's dinosaur book, you may come up with the conclusion that Leviathan is a kronosaurus. We have heard (and read) other suggestions, but the kronosaurus is the best match of any known creature to the description of Leviathan.\n\n A Plesiosaur, not a dinosaur, who's remains have been found in Australia and Colombia and is beleived to have been extinct since the end of the Cretaceous period (65 million years ago)? You mean that Kronosaurus? A far cry from the middle east in the last 4500 years...don't you think? \n \n Wow, actual research and critical thought, not just cut and paste regurgitation of anothers flawed theories.",

   "This has been a rather interesting thread so far. In reading it, I was reminded of an essay I read a while back, by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. In \"The Argentine Writer and Tradition\" he writes:\n \n \nSome days past I have found a curious confirmation of the fact that what is truly native can and often does dispense with local color; I found this confirmation in Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Gibbon observes that in the Arabian book par excellence, in the Koran, there are no camels; I believe if there were any doubt to the authenticity of the Koran, this absence of camels would be sufficient to prove it is an Arabian work. It was written by Mohammed, and Mohammed, as an Arab, had no reason to know that camels were especially Arabian; for him they were a part of reality, he had no reason to emphasize them; on the other hand, the first thing a falsifier, a tourist, an Arab nationalist would do is have a surfeit of camels, caravans of camels, on every page; but Mohammed, as an Arab, was unconcerned: he knew he could be an Arab without camels.\n\n \n \n And what does this have to do with the Bible and dinosaurs? The way I see it, Borges' approach to the Koran could be applied to any religious texts that claim a historical basis. So, if we apply this same line of thinking to the dinosaurs and dragons of the Bible, we're left with two options:\n \n 1) Dinosaurs and Dragons existed when these verses were written.\n \n Dinosaurs, when they did exist, were very common animals. More abundant than camels, even, and in all parts of the world. If dinosaurs were so common when these Biblical passages were written, why would it be necessary to write about them in such detail when the average reader of the time would already be quite familiar with such creatures? The authenticity of the Bible is therefore called into question.\n \n 2) The Bible is authentic* and the depictions of fantastical creatures are just that: fantasy.\n \n The author(s), for whatever reason, felt it necessary to introduce mythical creatures that had no basis in reality, much as Homer used mythical creatures like the cyclops, sirens, etc. in the Odyssey. Things that seem to resemble dragons and other strange, mighty creatures did not actually exist and were products of the author's imagination.\n \n I am curious what you think of this, Archangel. Can you be a Christian without dragons?\n \n *NOTE: I am not necessarily conceding that the Bible is the literal word of God. However, I will concede that there is some degree of historical authenticity.",

   "As for American Indian reports. Dispute this one source I found in 3 seconds. \n \n http://www.lilith-ezine.com/articles/2005/canadian_seaserpents.html\n \n Sea Serpents of Canada \n By Charles Alexander Moffat\n Unbeknownst to many Canadians and foreigners, Canada actually has an abundancy of sea-serpent/dragon myths, otherwise known as \"Loch Ness Monsters\". Like their Scottish relative, these Canadian sea serpents dwell in coastal waters and inland lakes. It is widely believed that if these sea serpents exist, then they are actually dinosaurs that somehow avoided the mass extinctions of the Cretaceous Period.\n In the case of Canadian Sea-Serpents, the native myths and legends about them have existed for thousands of years. Recorded sightings of such creatures date back to the 1700s.\n \n Jacques Cartier, the French explorer who mapped much of the St. Lawrence river, kept a journal of everything he did. He and members of his crew saw what they described as \"a giant finned snake\" that moved like a caterpillar, using its side fins to propel itself forward in the water. Cartier's crew tried to capture the beast, but it moved too quickly and dove beneath the waters.\n \n When Cartier consulted with natives in the region, they called the creature \"Gaasyendietha\". This was the first recorded sighting of any sea serpent in North America.\n \n But it would not be the last. Across Canada and the United states, there are numerous large lakes (most notably the Great Lakes, which was an inland sea during the last ice age) and a variety of sea-serpent myths to go with them.\n \n \n Gaasyendietha:\n \n According to Seneca myths, Gaasyendietha is said to be a dragon that dwells in Lake Ontario. Although it is seldom described, it is said to be quite large. Legends say this dragon could fly on a trail of fire, and it could also spew fire.\n \n Argont:\n \n According to Huron myths, Angont is a vicious, poisonous reptile who supposedly dwelled in desolate places such as caves, forests, lakes in the Lake Ontario/Lake Erie region. Its skin is poisonous, walks on four legs (very similar to a Komodo dragon from China) and is approximately the size or a horse or donkey. Legends say it also causes disasters and diseases.\n \n Amhuluk:\n \n Amhuluk supposedly lives in a lake in British Columbia or perhaps as far south as Oregon (there are multiple locations and sightings of Amhuluk). The most celebrated location is near Forkend Mountain in Oregon, where native americans greatly fear the beast. It is described as a very large sea serpent with horns.\n \n One story accounts how Amhuluk impaled two of three children on its horns and took them into the lake. The father visited these children, and for five days they appeared by the water. However, afterward, they disappeared and remained with Amhuluk. Many believe that this dragon's passion is to catch and drown things. The story is likely meant to scare children away from swimming in the lakes.\n \n Ancient Serpent:\n \n According to Piute myth, the Ancient Serpent lived in the Lake Pyramid and reportedly like to snatch victims. When the Piutes saw whirlpools in Lake Pyramid, they would not go near the lake, for they were afraid that the Ancient One was looking for another victim to snatch.\n \n The Bentinck Sea Serpent:\n \n Not actually a sea serpent, this endangered species is actually a very large snake, comparable to an anaconda. It is found in Bentinck township in Grey County, Ontario. It is a very large black snake that inhabits swamp areas, feeding on fish and other aquatic life. The largest Bentinck Black Snake ever found was thirty feet long, and was found in 1955.\n \n Kolowisi:\n \n The Zuni myths tell of Kolowisi, a huge water serpent with fins along its body, and small horns. One of the tales involves a young girl who goes to a spring. There, she found a small baby there and rescued it from the water. Without telling her parents, she took the baby and slept with it by her side.\n \n The \"baby\" was really Kolowisi, who then transformed into his true shape. He stole the girl and took her back to the spring. There, he made her his wife.\n \n In another story, however, Kolowisi held back the flood waters for a family to get up the mountain. By doing this, Kolowisi allowed these people to live, and then allowed the flood waters to fill the valley.\n \n \n Msi-Kinepeikwa:\n \n Sometimes called just \"Kinepikwa\", this dragon/serpent was a Shawnee myth. It was described as being a large serpent, much like a snake, that inhabited a lake. The Msi-Kinepeikwa achieved its form slowly. This massive serpent shed its skin and grew the next, growing larger each time. It is said that the first stage of this creature was a fawn with one red and one blue horn which was inside of a lake. This fawn grew and moved toward the water's edge, changing and growing until it became the serpent that the natives saw.\n \n Palulukon:\n \n The Hopi believe that hue water serpents with large plumes, and are revered as nature spirits, believed to be able to cause natural disasters when angered or hurt.\n \n The Spoonville Beach Sea Serpent:\n \n The Spoonville story appears to be one built by tourists and local area residents, in an effort to boost tourism. Descriptions of the beast sound more like a traditional dragon story, and may be completely fictionalized. There is no native myth about a sea serpent in that region, suggesting that this is just fabrication. The sea serpent is described as a huge creature with red, bloodshot eyes. The scales were said to be green, and smoke was said to billow out of its nostrils.\n \n Gloucester's Sea Serpent:\n \n On August 22, 1817, a publication in Boston entitled \"A Monsterous Sea Serpent: The largest ever seen in America\" was published. It reported a sea serpent that appeared in the harbor to be about forty-five to fifty-five feet in length with a head similar to a horse. Other sightings of the creature reported up to one hundred feet long and that the head was more snake-like.\n \n In Massachusetts, literally hundreds of people saw this creature. So many saw this sea monster that the government was forced to investigate. The Linnaean Society of New England created a special committee to investigate. Members included the judge John Davis, the doctor Jacob Bigelow, and the naturalist Francis Gray.\n \n According to hundreds of reports, it moved like a caterpillar, had a neck as thick as a barrel and approximately 45 to 100 feet long.\n \n \n Stvkwvnaya:\n \n Also called the \"Tie Snake\". According to the Seminole, it is reputed to have a single horn, which is said to be an aphrodisiac. It is described as being at least the size of a horse, and at least 20' in length, with 4 fins on its sides.\n \n There are many more legends and sightings across North America, such Ogopogo in British Columbia, and the Lake Champlain sea serpent in Pennsylvania. I am not listing all of them on here.\n \n Sea serpent legends/sightings are only found in temperate parts of Canada and the United States. When they are sighted, most people don't even know the proper name of the creature because they didn't even know that the region had a sea serpent myth.\n \n Most police forces do not keep track of such sightings either, firmly believing that people are just pulling their legs.\n \n It would be difficult to tell just how many sightings occur per year, because most people likely don't report the sightings, and even if they did, most authorities wouldn't even bother to write up a report. They have murderers and rapists to worry about. Tracking down a so-called sea serpent, which may or may not be a prank, is considered to be a waste of time.\n \n And even if they did find one, it would most certainly be an endangered species, likely eat fresh-water fish, and is nothing much to worry about.\n \n It is important to note that this planet has many unusual creatures that we don't learn about in grade school. Schools tend to teach animals that fit into the ABCs (A is for Anteater, B is for Bird, C is for Cat, etc). The Komodo dragon (a poisonous reptile about the size of a horse) and 50' long giant squids are real creatures, but they are rarely ever seen. No one has ever made a high-quality photo of \"big-foot\" and sasquatches, but we know they exist because we have fossils of them (in the scientific community, the fossils are known as homo gigantus).\n \n We know that sea-serpent-ish dinosaurs did once exist, because we have fossils of them. We also know from these fossils that they ate fish.\n \n We even have one preserved \"sea serpent\" that was found in the nets of a Portuguese fishing boat off the coast of Newfoundland in 1989. It was partially decomposed, and is believed to either have been hit by a passing ship (its fins were torn badly) or it had been preserved in ice for millions of years and had only recently melted.\n \n Every religion has flood myths, and they also have some form of sea serpent/dragon myth, including the bible. Either these religions made up these myths to explain the bones of dinosaurs, or people have actually sighted such creatures.\n \n And like every good fish story, the tale tends to get longer and more impressive with the telling. Before you know it the lowly sea serpent has sprouted wings and can spit fire\n\n OK, prove these. Wow, that took about 3 seconds as well.\n \n Let's review:\n The word \"Myth\" is used 12 times. I assume you know what the word myth means.\n \n There is no tangible evidence of sea monsters, only myth and legends. Perhaps there is a reason for this? The vast majority of the photographs of sea monsters have been shown to be either faked or to be photos of something else that can be mistaken as a sea monster (kinda like a piece of toast that looks like Elvis).\n \n Gaasyendietha according to legend can not only fly on a trail of fire, but can transition between the earth and heaven on it's trail of fire. Please don't tell me you believe that too.\n \n Argont causes natural disasters? Sure it does. Is this trying to say that argont is not just a sea monster, but has magical powers as well? Please.\n \n Amhuluk: One story accounts how Amhuluk impaled two of three children on its horns and took them into the lake. The father visited these children, and for five days they appeared by the water. However, afterward, they disappeared and remained with Amhuluk. Many believe that this dragon's passion is to catch and drown things. The story is likely meant to scare children away from swimming in the lakes. \n Impaled 2 kids and took them to the lake. Then the dragon let's these kids visit dad for 5 days, and then kept them. Even the little blurb states that the story was likely meant to scare children away from the lakes. \n \n The Bentinck Sea Serpent: According to the story, a large species of black snake. Hmmm, some sea monster there.\n \n Kolowisi: One of the tales involves a young girl who goes to a spring. There, she found a small baby there and rescued it from the water. Without telling her parents, she took the baby and slept with it by her side. The \"baby\" was really Kolowisi, who then transformed into his true shape. He stole the girl and took her back to the spring. There, he made her his wife. In another story, however, Kolowisi held back the flood waters for a family to get up the mountain. By doing this, Kolowisi allowed these people to live, and then allowed the flood waters to fill the valley.\n Did you read these before you posted it? Laughable.\n \n Msi-Kinepeikwa: A fawn (baby dear) that lives in the lake with 2 colored horns, and eventually grows into a sea serpent. Does that sounds rediculous to you?\n \n Palulukon: Again, causing natural disasters when angry? Sure.\n \n The Spoonville Beach Sea Serpent: The Spoonville story appears to be one built by tourists and local area residents, in an effort to boost tourism. There is no native myth about a sea serpent in that region, suggesting that this is just fabrication. Fabricated legend to boost tourism? Great evidence.\n \n Gloucester's Sea Serpent: One of the busiest commercial fishing posts in the US. You would think someone would have a picture of video or something tangible as actual proof. But no proof...none whatsoever. Thought by many to be something to draw tourism to the area. Also, if an actual reality, likely to be an Oar Fish. \n \n Stvkwvnaya: I guess someone actually caught this thing, and that's how they learned that the horn was an aphrodisiac? Sure they did.\n \n The cut and paste post states that most people would likely not report the sighting? Does that sound realistic? If I saw something like this, I would scream to high hell about it. \n \n Big foot: We have big foot fossils? No we do not. We have fossils of Gigantopithecus (quadrupedal, rather than bipedal) and Homo Erectus that some have theorized could be big foot. We have never found fossilized remains of either of these species in N. America. Simply people offering an explanation, not proof. There is again no tangible proof of big foot.\n \n We don't have fossils of sea-serpentish dinosaurs. We have fossils of sea going plesiosaurs, which are widely considered to not be closely related to dinosaurs. Dinosaurs were terrestrial creatures.\n \n The preserved sea serpent caught by the fishing boat: While I found no mention of the 1989 incident in Newfoundland, I did find the 1977 mention of the \"sea serpent\" caught by the Japanese fishing boat of the coast of New Zealand. It turned out to be a basking shark. There have been other \"sea serpents as well\" that have been proven to be nothing more than a rotting basking shark, or a basking shark that was cut up by a boat prop.\n \n \n And my absolute favorite from the entire post:\n \n And like every good fish story, the tale tends to get longer and more impressive with the telling. Before you know it the lowly sea serpent has sprouted wings and can spit fire\n \n There is a large difference between myth and reality which most people can easily seperate. Myths are a part of every culture. What I asked for was some sort of reliable information that would lead one to believe that the Native Americans walked around with dinosaurs. You have failed to give me evne the slightest hint of evidence on the subject. Instead, you choose to muddy the issue by posting myths about sea serpents, which even if they did exist, are not dinosaurs. Perhaps you should actually read things before you post them. I myself would have been embarrased to post something like that. A complete red herring to the issue at hand, and laughable to boot.",

On the day that we closed the book on the Old Testament after completing our study of it, do you know what happened to me ?

I drive, shop, own things, enjoy skiing, the beach, hiking, camping, movies, dancing, dining out and many other activities that define modern day people. But I reject the downside of the flesh as in anything that attempts to separate me from a closer walk with my Father. I seek balance in life and my basis for determining that balance is if it draws me away from Him then it is bad for me. It's as simple as that.",

Indeed one can postulate that Christ was attempting to make an even bigger break from the traditions of the old testament than he managed to pull off. Much of the original intent was lost as the RCC buried christianity under the ponderous structure of Roman institutions up to and including the old Roman office of Pontifex maximums (ie the Pope). And of course as the leadership adopted the necessary overlays of theology and such to draw the population of Italy and Europe into the fold.

This was the most important position in the Ancient Roman religion, open only to patricians until 254 BC, when a plebeian first occupied this post. A distinctly religious office under the early Roman Republic, it gradually became politicized until, beginning with Augustus, it was subsumed into the Imperial office. It was last held by the Christian Roman Emperor Gratian until the title passed over to the Bishop of Rome.[1][2]\n \n Today, \"Pontifex Maximus\" is one of the titles of the Pope. As a papal title, the translation Supreme Pontiff is customary when writing in English, in which the Latin term Pontifex Maximus refers to the former pagan Roman post. But Latin is still the official language of the Catholic Church and of the Vatican, and the Latin form Pontifex Maximus is still used in reference to the Pope when writing or speaking in that language. The title appears regularly on buildings, monuments and coins (among other things) dedicated by or otherwise made during each specific pontificate.\n",

I am not claiming to be the final authority on anything, but defend the bible as Gods final authority on spiritual issues. The No true Scotsman argument is not defined by one appointing themselves up as the final authority anyway so you have it wrong as usual. Here is the definition so you'll stop abusing the term in every debate.\n \n \nNo true Scotsman\n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Jump to: navigation, search\n No true Scotsman is a term coined by Antony Flew in his 1975 book Thinking About Thinking - or do I sincerely want to be right?[1]:\n \n Argument: \"No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.\" \n Reply: \"But my uncle Angus likes sugar with his porridge.\" \n Rebuttal: \"Ah yes, but no true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.\" \n This form of argument is an informal fallacy if the predicate (\"putting sugar on porridge\" or \"doing such a thing [as committing a sex crime]\") is not actually contradictory for the accepted definition of the subject (\"Scotsman\"), or if the definition of the subject is silently adjusted after the fact to make the rebuttal work.[2]\n \n Source of the fallacy\n The truth of a proposition depends on its adequacy to its object (\"Is the drawing a true likeness of Antony Flew?\"). The truth of an object depends on its adequacy to its concept (\"Is the figure drawn on the paper a true triangle?\"). Problems arise when the definition of the concept has no generally accepted form, for example when it is vague or contested.\n \n \"A true Scotsman\" (a concept) is not on the same level as \"a true triangle\" (a concept) never mind \"the true Antony Flew\" (a concrete existing object). The formal similarity, \"true X\", and the corresponding feeling that the concepts should be on the same level, in some sense must be on the same level (even perhaps all exist as objects), motivates the fallacy. It is a short step from that feeling to treating one's own definition of a \"true Scotsman\" (who else's?) as having the same objectivity as that of a geometrical figure or an existing individual, and then attempting to make the world agree.\n \n [edit] Examples\n It is also a common fallacy in politics, in which critics may condemn their colleagues as not being \"true\" Communists, liberals or conservatives because they occasionally disagree on certain matters of policy. It comes in many other forms - \"No decent person would\" - it is argued \"support hanging/watch pornography/smoke in public\", etc. Often the speaker seems unaware that he/she is, in fact, coercively (re)defining, 'objectifying', the meaning of the phrase \"decent person\" to include/exclude what he/she wants and NOT simply following what the phrase is already accepted as meaning. The argument shifts the debate from being about hanging/pornography/smoking and tries to make it seem that anyone disagreeing with the speaker is arguing for the \"indecent\".\n \n [edit] Exceptions\n Some elements or actions are clearly contradictory to the subject, and therefore aren't fallacies. The statement \"No true vegetarian would eat a beef steak\" is not fallacious because it follows from the accepted definition of \"vegetarian\": Eating meat, by definition (rather than just by association), disqualifies a (present-tense) categorization among vegetarians, and the further value judgement between a \"true vegetarian\" and the implied \"false vegetarian\" cannot likewise be categorized as a fallacy, given the clear disjunction. However, the \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy might also be used in claiming that no \"true\" vegetarian would wear fur or leather, as this hinges on a (possible) associated trait, rather than the definition of vegetarianism.\n \n Alternatively, if a statement in the \"no true Scotsman\" form is not intended as an empirical argument, but as the conclusion to an argument about definition, then it is not a fallacy. It is possible to make formally valid arguments about contested definitions. The statement \"No true Marxist would support the Soviet invasion of Hungary because the basic goal of Marxism is the self-emancipation of the working class\" may or may not be true, but it is not an instance of the \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy.\n \n \n \n \n",

This not only reeks of extremism, it generally is a pretty good indicator that the speaker is an idiot who has spent very little time in history courses. Virtually every generation since the beginnign of recorded history has believed they had it all figured out...and every generation has been wrong.

You couldn't help but do it in the very next response to my post. emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n Like i said...I drop in here and troll every once in a while. You act like I am denying it. I am not. I toss some hand grenades at the extremists and watch the mess. Sometimes it is amusing. It would be more fun if it worked on more people. Normal, rational people don't fall for it. You never see guys like steeeve, JP, or liminus working themselves into a frenzy. Why? Because they are not extremists. They maintain enough rationality to recognize trolling when they see it and to know when somebody has presented either a circular argument or one that demands that their opponent defend an insanely irrational position....and not necessarily one of their choosing, \n \n I would almost feel bad about doing it (if it was not so funny to watch) but it IS a valid debating tactic...and an extremely effective one when you are debating somebody who has a lot of emotional baggage when it comes to the subject of debate.",
