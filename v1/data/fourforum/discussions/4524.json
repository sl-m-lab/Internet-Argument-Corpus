   "Don't know if anybody else bothered reading the book \"Whats wrong with Kansas\", but I did. I found it disturbing.\n \n For those who are not following, he chose Kansas fro his book because Kansas is pretty much the most average state in the union. There is an old saying \"As goes GM, so goes the nation\". You could accurately say \"As goes Kansas, so goes the nation\". Polls conducted in Kansas have accurately predicted the outcome of the presidential election since the civil war. Political commercials are generally tested in Kansas before they go nationwide. Marketing interests also recognize the fact that Kansas is the most average state in the union, and we are the test market for everything from shoes to hamburgers. Thats right, our MC Donald's has a bigger menu than yours, as does our KFC, Hardies, etc.... We have things at our burger king that you have never heard of, and there are styles of Nike shoes on the shelf at the local shoe store that none of you have probably ever seen. \n \n First, a lot is said about perceived liberal elitism and how far afield that label actually is. The entire book just wreaked of liberal elitism. He basically argues that we in Kansas are somehow backward politically because we fail to adhere to his enlightened political views. The simple fact of the matter is, Kansas tried the whole liberal thing and found it to be a rather poor way of doing things.\n \n Second, there is a rather lengthy section regarding corruption. The author fails to grasp the concept of \"corruption\", IMHO. There is a difference between corruption such as cash for favors and similar questionable practices, and prominence. Here in Kansas, there are certainly corrupt officials. They RUN the city of El Dorado, and have run it into the ground. The authors argument doe not stop with corrupt public officials, though, he makes the same claims and accusations in regards to prominent businessmen in local communities. There is a difference between being a prominent businessman and being corrupt. The two are not interchangeable, and the difference is more than just academic.\n \n I personally am generally considered a \"prominent\" businessman in my community. This is not because I have paid cash for political favors, or used my corporate position to push for measures beneficial to my own interests but detrimental to the community as a whole (though I will not claim I a have never done these things). I am a prominent businessman because I pay my people well and take good care of them; I am generally viewed as a good employer. I am often in the newspaper not because of my company, but because I am a member of our local fire department and often managed to procure equipment that we could not otherwise afford. I am a member of the rotary club and on the fund raising board. I am on the friends of the zoo council. I am the president of the friends of the library. I arranged the donations of 20 building lots for our local habitat for humanities chapter. I arranged the donation of 50 building lots to our local technical college for their construction program. I am on our parish finance committee. I am always the first to jump up at county commissioners meetings and threaten to form a torch carrying mob to drag the commissioners out of their houses and crucify them on the wall of the courthouse (there was a quote worth remembering) when they are considering measures detrimental to the public good. I open up my warehouse in the winter so homeless folks don't freeze to death on the street (which is bad for tourism).\n \n There are a lot of folks like me in Kansas, many or most of whom are more prominent than I, and do MUCH more for their community than my measly efforts. It is these folks who wield real power in their communities, not the guy who pays off a county commissioner or 2 to get a road paved. I think that by failing to differentiate between the two, the author does a real disservice to those who have managed to build a little power base not based on corruption and under the table payoffs, but by noteworthy public acts. Do these folks get special consideration at times? Of course. Not because they have paid the proper people the right bribes, though (bribes are reserved for congressmen), but because the powers that be realize that to take on people whose names are generally associated with good deeds pretty much places them in the \"bad guys\" department, and it is bad for their public image.\n \n Third, the ascertain that by voting republican we in Kansas are voting against our own good is ridiculous. The problem is not that we have been duped by the republicans into voting for representative that bring about economic policies that have a negative impact on the state. The problem is that we cannot tell the difference between the democrats and the republicans anymore from an economic standpoint. \n \n Part of this is likely the result of a serious financial crisis, and the fact that our politicians are trying to essentially sweep it under the rug. Some of the measures proposed/taken are pretty bad. In the last couple of years, we have had a democrat (sebelius) as Governor, and a lot of the bad economic conditions have been the result of having to bargain with sebelius. An example would be last years budget, where Sibelius announced that we would issue $245 million in bonds to make up for shortfalls. The Kansas legislature is constitutionally prohibited from issuing bonds without a dedicated revenue stream for repayment. Under the Sibelius plan, such a stream was identified, but it only accounted for $55 million. The legislature passed it anyway as part of a deal with the governors office. \n \n We certainly recognize that we have financial problems here. The problem is that we have no real choice as far as elected representatives. Several years ago the state went through a process of re-districting that pretty much guarantees that we have only 2 choices, democrat or republican. This seems to be something else they tested in Kansas first and then did to the rest of the nation. \n \n This being the case, the two party system has taken over our local politics much as it has taken over national politics. Nobody has any real hope of being elected unless they gain the endorsement of their party, and nobody gains the endorsement of their party unless they are seen as likely to march to the proper beat.\n \n I cannot think of a single Kansan that I know personally who does not seen fiscal restraint (I.E cutting spending) as the proper solution to our current financial problems. I do not know of any politicians at the state level who see things this way. They prefer to focus on sneak taxes and mathematical voodoo. They seem more interested in keeping up the appearance of normality than in actually solving the problem.\n \n As far as constituent input, our politicians enjoy much the same situation as our national politicians. They have no need to prove to the public that they will perform, or that they are attempting to address constituents concerns. They will be re-elected either way, since we really only have 2 choices, republican or democrat, and you pretty much have to be green lighted by your party in order to be elected. Every local race is simply a re-enactment of the last presidential campaign. The two sides play the lesser of two evil game, content int he knowledge that regardless of which side wins that particular round, the two have become so close ideologically that it really doesn't matter that much.\n \n While I found the book entertaining, more because it was about my home state than because it held any real academic value, I think there were some pretty serious flaws in his reasoning. While we certainly have our share of problems, his solution seems to be \"vote democrat\". We are already voting democrat. We are just voting for the ones that claim to be republicans. If you write \"COW\" on a horse, it is still a horse. If you label a democrat as a republican, they are still a democrat.\n \n As a side note, if thing in Kansas are indeed a prelude to things to come for the rest of the nation, we are ****ed as a country.",

   "Here's one view of what's wrong.\n \n Testimony of Dr. Stephen Case of the Center for Science Education at the University of Kansas and co-chair of the Kansas science standards writing committee before the subcommittee on science standards of the Kansas Board of Education. All three members of the subcommittee are YECs.\n \n -----------------------------------\n \n Dr. Posny, I have reviewed the questions and procedures as requested by the Board Subcommittee. Unfortunately, I do not find any changes that address my primary concern. The credibility of these hearings, real and perceived by the public is still in question.\n \n Let me illustrate what I mean by beginning with the questions. The questions show a clear point of view with a strong bias. The perception of the science and science education communities, and also by the public, is that the Board Subcommittee has preconceived answers to these questions. For example, it is very clear that the expected answer to Question One, is contained in Question Three.\n \n At our initial meeting, one reason I felt that we needed to spell out the specific questions was once the issues were defined it would be clear that there is a very large body of literature available on all these questions, perhaps most notably the \"National Science Education Standards\", the \"Benchmarks for Science Literacy\" and \"Science of all Americans\" all of which were written for the general public and are easily assessable. These documents clearly answer Questions One through Six. The issues of the minority report brought up in the questions have been specifically addressed by twelve peer reviews, written by highly qualified scientists. To date no response to the reviews has been made by anyone listed on the minority report.\n \n Specific comments on the questions follow;\n \n 1) Discuss your understanding of the definition of science, particularly with reference to the majority and minority definitions. The notion that there are only two positions on the committee is an incorrect assumption. The only question I have heard emerge in this area is about science being limited to natural (matter and energy) explanations. Is this limit how science progresses accurate or does (or can) science include supernatural explanations?\n \n 2) Discuss your understanding of a hypothesis and theory, particularly with regard to evolution and how an individual hypothesis and theory is used and supported and what happens when competing hypotheses and theories are at odds.\n \n This is clearly explained in the National Science Education Standards, the current Kansas Education Standards, the Benchmarks for Science Literacy and in \"Science of all Americans\". 3) Discuss the idea that the best scientific inquiry is performed in the fashion of empirical science, that is, observable, measurable, testable, repeatable, and falsifiable?\n \n Question one asks about a definition of science, then question three suggests a very specific definition of science and an incorrect definition at that? It would seem that question three is the assumed answer to question one. Again the National Standards clearly state what they mean by scientific inquiry.\n \n \"Students at all grade levels and in every domain of science should have the opportunity to use scientific inquiry and develop the ability to think and act in ways associated with inquiry, including asking questions, planning and conducting investigations, using appropriate tools and techniques to gather data, thinking critically and logically about relationships between evidence and explanations, constructing and analyzing alternative explanations, and communicating scientific arguments.\" (NRC, 1996, p. 105)\n \n 4) Discuss the scientific evidence concerning the idea that natural selection and/or mutations produce speciation.\n \n There has been 150 years of work in this area across virtually all taxon of life. There are literally 100,000s of research reports that address speciation. The best general information and explanations are in the NRC document \"Evolution and the Nature of Science\" and also in National Science Education Standards, the current Kansas Education Standards, the Benchmarks for Science Literacy and in \"Science of all Americans\". 5) Discuss the scientific evidence concerning the idea that there is a common biological ancestor.\n \n The best general information is in the NRC document Evolution and the Nature of Science.\n \n 6) Discuss the scientific evidence concerning the idea of what can falsify the Theory of Biological Evolution, particularly how radiometric dating and the fossil record interacts with the idea of falsification.\n \n Falsification is a statistical (Popper) concept that has little to do with scientific theory. Falsification can be applied to hypothesis testing however uncertainty, as a philosophical concept, is best discussed in reference to theory. 7) Discuss the idea that students (after moving from concrete thinking and being able to think in the abstract) should be able to explain, in scientific terms, the philosophy of science and various theories of science, as well as various scientific criticisms.\n \n This is probably best addressed by development physiologists. I would think that the level of abstraction that an individual is capable of highly idiosyncratic and is best assessed by the teacher, in a learner centered environment. I do not think we can approach standards for all students with broad sweeps of development. For example there is a great deal of research that Piaget's developmental stages to not match up to chronological ages. Many, if not most college freshman would fall into concrete sequential. Howard Gardner's work is much more appropriate to education then some sort of linear development of abstraction reflected in Piaget. That being sad, I think that logic and philosophy can be introduced in elementary schools - however the level of sophistication necessary to understand the arguments around the nature of science probably require a much higher level of education and reasoning then found in your average high school student. 8) US education, particularly with regard to mathematics and science, has been criticized for being a mile wide and an inch deep and thus not promoting critical thinking and/or problem solving skills. With regard to Science Education, is this a valid concern? Discuss the idea of how teachers need to or need not address this situation.\n \n This is clearly a well identified issue in education however it is a gross generalization. The question should be more specifically ask what should be eliminated and what should be taught in greater depth. In the 2001 Standards there was a decrease emphasis on process and an increase in content - at the Board's request.\n \n As to the framework for this process that is suggested:\n \n As mentioned above, I do not find any changes that address my primary concern - the credibility of these hearings. There have not been any changes that alter the real or perceived perception that this is a rigged hearing. The potential damage for the State of Kansas that can result from hearings is significant. The issue that I am struggling with is that I do not have a good suggestion for you as to how you can make these hearings credible. The following questions remain for me,\n \n Who are the arbitrators/judges of this information and a related question what will their judgment result in?\n \n A very common comment I have heard is \"Why does the State Board Science Subcommittee think they are qualified to take this on, aren't they an education policy board\"? The focus of the hearings should be the education standards and what is appropriate for inclusion in the standards, not on the science. The science community has a high bar of credibility for scientific information. This kind of forum has nothing in common with the way the science community advances scientific understanding. As we have heard, over and over again in the public hearings, the science community feels the Intelligent Design creationists/ antievolutionist are trying to do an end run around the bar of scientific credibility and insert religious propaganda into the science classroom. This agenda is creating a high level of distrust by the science community about the body sitting in judgment of such a forum.\n \n When the government policy makers have questions of the science community and need expert opinion to inform policy, they turn to the National Academies. This was in fact the reason that the National Academies was established. In Kansas, the State Board turns to its expert panels, people who are specifically chosen for their expert background, so that they can make judgments of technical issues and advise the Board on the policy implications.\n \n What is the credibility of the witnesses?\n \n This procedure does not address my concern about the qualifications of contributors to this process. I see a potential mismatch between experts and the subjects they are addressing. For example, scientists should not speak to education policy and imply that we should give them greater credibly in education because of their science credentials. The procedural suggestions seem to suggest that anyone who agrees with me is qualified to answer your questions. This is not how we advance understanding and would just reinforce/support existing ideas.\n \n Does a Nobel Laureate in the field of interest who has spent a lifetime in study of these issues of science have the same credibility as someone who did an internet search? Dr. Harris is quite right; I do have concerns about the credibility of people he might suggest and how they might match up to the scientists. For example, Dr. Jonathan Wells is a frequent source for comments at the public hearings and his views are clearly reflected in the minority report. Dr. Wells has no academic credibility, has done no work in biology beyond a rather weak doctoral program, has very questionable motivation for pursing his education in biology, and, because of a felony conviction, would not be qualified to be a science teacher in Kansas. My question still remains, what is the standard for credible contributors to this process.\n \n What is the time commitment you are asking for?\n \n As I see it the time commitment you are asking for is enormous. Given that reviewers have already contributed work specific to the minority report and there is a large body of existing literature that address the questions, these communities have indicated to me that they see no benefit for further time investment. The more qualified the person, the busier and more engaged in their work they are. Based on their comments I find it highly unlikely that you would find anyone from the science or science education community that would agree to participate. I am relatively certain that the reviewers would be unwilling to continue to generate more information until Dr. Harris or someone listed on the minority report responds to their pervious work. Both Dr. Harris and Mr. Calvert indicated they had responses at the Board Subcommittee meeting on February 23, 2005 but no response has been. An additional concern from several individuals is that they feel that these hearings want to use their credibility and credentials to bring apparent credibility to these hearings. This makes them very uncomfortable.\n \n On a personal note, I thought I had been excused from this exercise in deference to my role as committee chair? The committee is continuing our work and we will have Draft Two of our recommendations to you later this month. At the last writing committee meeting, it was indicated that the issues of the minority report would be decided at a higher level. My concerns about the Boards hearing being divisive to the committee are coming true. If the effort here is to include me as the commentator, then I must respectfully decline. I do not have the time to take on another task. I have at least six research papers (work done but not written up) in the queue. As I am a researcher and this is my work which I cannot neglect to take on this additional work.\n \n I also have to admit I also feel a bit used. As Ms. Morris pointed out, I am a smart guy. I learned a long time ago that it is not wise to jump through other people's hoops just because they hold them out for me. I have worked for many years to build my credibility and I am unwilling to spend it to prop up these hearings. I feel that I need to stay clearly focused on the Standards process, in which I agreed to participate, and produce our best recommendations for the Board, through the established process.\n \n Steven B.

All three members of the subcommittee are YECs.\n\n \n Huh? I am not sure exactly what he is referring to as the problem here. I would say that if you asked him directly, he would say the problem is that, despite the huge debate that came from the whole creation evolution thing here in kansas, and all the hours that went into decisionmaking at the state level, local school boards threw that memo on the trash when it came. We throw most of those memos in the trash. While I certainly understand that in theory such decisions are to be made at a state level, we have a system of locally elected school boards in kansas, and school board members are responsible to their constituency, not to some academic board at the state level.\n \n Also, since Kansas schools rate very high nationally, I doubt that this is really a problem.\n \n Around here, the creation vs evolution debate didn't get nearly as much attention as the national media pretended. While there was certainly much ado at the state level, at the local level it was largely a non issue. This is mostly because we are not all XXXXXX and fanatics. XXXXXX and fanatics on both sides of that debate are what fuels it. Rational people feel no need to kill others religous beliefs, regardless of what they are. \n \n In our district, we teach \"evolution light\". Our teachers teach the concpet of evolution, including documented evidence of evolution. They generally do no go so far as to say \"Man came from monkey\" because frankly there is no insurmountable evidence that supports this. \n \n Creationist type questions are directed to the school borad. It has only happened once in the 2 years I have been a sitting member, and I handled it. I sat the lady who raised the questions down, explained that high school science teachers are generally not the sharpest pencils in the cup, or they would not be high school science teachers, they would be out working in their field making money.\n \n I explained that to teach creationism in school was simply not practical because it is such a big subject, and requires a full understanding of god and devine principals, and that frankly our high school science teachers were not knowledgable in such areas. I suggested that she speak with clergy and see if she they might be willing to approach the subject with her children, since they certainly held a better understanding of it that I or any of the teachers in our district did. I gave her the phone number of a local clergyman who I had previously spoken to who was willing to teach creationism to children. \n \n She left happy. EVERBODY was happy. There is no sense in punching somebody when a handshake will do the trick, and going after somebodies religion to score cheap points is stupid.\n \n At the end of the day, despite the fact that we continually elect Pat Robertson, there are not that many fundies in Kansas. We elect Robertson because he keeps his campaign promises, rare in todays politicians.",

We also have a declining tax base.\n \n Latest figures I have seen that include debt service and bond/debt repayment at a municipal and state level suggest that over the next 5 years, as more of these bond issues move into the payable category, we will face a deficit that may well require a 40% across the board cut in public services. \n \n Personally, I have no problem with this, but to the politicians at the state level, this is seen as disasterous. In reality, there is really no hope of cutting aour overly generous social programs, since we have reached the point where professional welfare recipients make up a rather impressive voting block (and they DO vote). \n \n Politicians on the local level have gotten creative in revenue generation, and it has been dangerous to liberty. As proof of this, I humbly submit the criminal sentencing practices of Johnson County.\n \n Johnson County, Ks is actually the wealthiest county in the country. Faced with some pretty serious economic shortfalls, they instituted a new program where criminals whoa re sentence to jail time are charged $65 per day to cover the cost of their incarceration. The genius of the plan is that they farm out theri prisoners to other counties for $30 per day, and Johnson county pockets the other $35 per day. Since the county has begun turning a profit on keeping people in jail, the number of jail days handed out by the courts has increased over 600%.\n \n Why the residents of Johnson county have not stormed the courthouse with torches and pitchforks I have no idea. I do know that If I ever get pulled over in Johnson county, I will likely shoot and run rather than face a criminal justice system that turns a profit based on the severity of the penalty handed down from the bench.\n \n I like to think that here in rural kansas, if such a thing ever took place, we would have already shot the elected officials who passed it, as well as any judge who dared actually use it. \n \n While I can certainly appreciate the fact that people do not wnat to have to pay the costs associated with maintainig a criminal justice system, I belive that those costs were MEANT to be born by the public, not by the accused. It is a safegaurd against out of control politicians who would make frivolous laws. I CERTAINLY can never support a system where the public turns a profit based on incarceration.",

Sales/use and property taxes are obvious targets, but those taxes labeled as fees are becoming very popular. Anything to do with vehicles is an easy mark, as is construction, infrastructure, sin and leisure pleasure. \n \n A major problem, if not the major problem facing most states (and local municipalities) is the cost of government including education. Salaries and especially benefits in most cases are now far, far beyond those in the private sector. A majority of bureaucracies are now unionized, creating almost a stranglehold on the public. When contracts are up for renewal, bargaining techniques no longer employ salary/benefit levels to comparable private sector jobs, they use other municipalities as comps where the unions have already stuck a gun to the publics head. \n \n I know of few government jobs at any level that don't include annual merit raises, COLAs and retirement programs.

   "Thats a scary local law Johnson county has there. It would definetly take a mild mannered bookworm locked up for peeing on the sidewalk, and turn him in to a machine gun Kelly. :) It looks like a couple of the city council members need to be incarcerated for say, drunk driving charges, and let them feel for themselves , the brunt of their extended stay, \"justice\" system. jmo\n\n \n Personally, I find it horrifying, and what is more horrifying is the fact that so many people support it. \n \n I believe that when you have to wonder who is in jail becuase they need to be there, and who is just there as a profitable prisoner, you have failed as a free society.",

   "Unless your constitution requires a majority popular vote to increase them, they'll go to taxpayers for what they think they need. Sales/use and property taxes are obvious targets, but those taxes labeled as fees are becoming very popular. Anything to do with vehicles is an easy mark, as is construction, infrastructure, sin and leisure pleasure. \n\n \n We do not have such a constitutional provision. I am not sure that it would really matter if we did, though. We DO have a balanced budget requirement in our constitution, and lawmakers put teams of lawyers on that one, explaining why it does not apply to bond issues or whatever other form of debt accumulation is popular at the moment, and people ate it up. \n \n We DID manage to get rid of the clunker tax that was passed last year. The clunker tax required that people pay sales tax on their vehicles based not on what they paid for the vehicle (the sale price), but rather on the bluebook value. Vehicle taxes are still on the rise, though.\n \n I don't think increases in construction taxation is going to be a problem, since the lions share of construction in Ks is still controlled by organised crime, and you don't want to **** with those guys. They are pretty serious folks.\n \n \nA major problem, if not the major problem facing most states (and local municipalities) is the cost of government including education. Salaries and especially benefits in most cases are now far, far beyond those in the private sector. A majority of bureaucracies are now unionized, creating almost a stranglehold on the public. When contracts are up for renewal, bargaining techniques no longer employ salary/benefit levels to comparable private sector jobs, they use other municipalities as comps where the unions have already stuck a gun to the publics head. \n \n \n I know of few government jobs at any level that don't include annual merit raises, COLAs and retirement programs. The retirement programs in particular, with full, uncapped medical coverage, are so bloated that teacher and other public worker retirement investment funds are now major players in bond and equity markets. When was the last time anyone heard of general private industry currently offering a retirement program where average workers can live on the proceeds with full medical coverage?\n \n As our society matures and expanding civil and social service costs replace former middle class workers who contributed to tax bases, IMO cost of government will soon be the number one fiscal problem facing all states, counties and cities. Kansas is not the exception, it's the norm. Make sure your primary residence is legally homesteaded.\n\n \n cost of gfovernment is certainly a major problem, and compensation to government workers is rediculously high. The thing I have found interesting, though, is that they have effectively managed to freeze compensation for lower tier workers, while increasing it at an alarming level for management. \n \n In theiry, Ks workers ARE unionized, but in reality, a janitor will get no union supprt, while a mid level supervisor can expect full support for any grievance they may have. I know that COLA increases have been frozen for the last several years for custodians at our local college (I know one), but management salaries have increased nearly 20% in the last 3 years.\n \n Beyond price of government, I think there is a real problem with public benifit from government services, or at least a problem with very low percived benifit form service costs. \n \n Locally, we saw a 7% increase in property taxes last year. This is supposed to be a temporary increase in order to help pay road maintenance cost s(like there is any such thing as a temporary tax increase). Also, last year, they quit plowing county and city roads, citing the expense involved. Most people failed to make the connection, or to ask \"WTF are we paying an additional 7% in property taxes for if they are not using the money to imporve road maintenance?\" Personally, it does not bother me. I drive an F-450. No amount of snow is likely to keep me stranded. For other folks, though, this is a major inconvenience since this is kansas, and getting 8\" of snow overnight is fairly common in the winter and 24\" in a 24 hour period is not at all unheard of.\n \n BUT, we built a $21 million courthouse, and now have no idea how we are going to repay the bonds on it. It is march, and when I called the road and bridge department the other day to see about getting some gravel dumped ont eh road to my house, the head fo the department said \"I can't, we are out of money\". Out of money in march????",
