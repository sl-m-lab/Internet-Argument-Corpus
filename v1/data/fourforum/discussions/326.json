   "I have since been back to the communist forum, and given a couple of arguments. Since you are my new friends, I though I would let you in on an interesting discussion I had over there. The communist pukes were trying to bad mouth the intelligence community, especially the CIA, for their role in Chilean affairs. I took the other side of the argument, and defended the purpose of having agencies that spy on foreign governments. I started by refuting the claim that the CIA was directly responsible for the Allende murder in Chile. Then I outlined the use of such agencies, and compared our intelligence networks to those in communist countries. Give me some feedback. I am way off base, or am I right on target. It will be interesting to see what normal people think, and compare it to the perverted minds of those communists I love to debate.\n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \"The CIA's role in Chile was primarily to provide funds and influence opposition political parties. In 1971, a new covert action was approved to renew support to the PDC. In 1972, a new covert action project was authorized to provide support to the National Party and the Democratic Radical Party. CIA's continuing financial support to the propaganda mechanisms described above was intended to continue media placements in support of opposition parties and against the Allende regime. The CIA was instructed to put the US Government in a position to take future advantage of either a political or military solution to the Chilean dilemma, depending on how developments unfolded. \n \n The CIA continued to collect intelligence on Chilean military officers actively opposed to the Allende government, but no effort was made to assist them in any way. Some CIA assets and contacts were in direct contact with coup plotters; CIA guidance was that the purpose of these contacts was only to collect intelligence. As coup rumors and planning escalated by the end of 1972, CIA exercised extreme care in all dealings with Chilean military officers and continued to monitor their activities but under no circumstances attempted to influence them. By October 1972 the consensus within the US government was that the military intended to launch a coup at some point, that it did not need US support for a successful coup, and that US intervention or assistance in a coup should be avoided.\" \n \n \"On 10 September 1973-the day before the coup that ended the Allende Government-a Chilean military officer reported to a CIA officer that a coup was being planned and asked for US Government assistance. He was told that the US Government would not provide any assistance because this was strictly an internal Chilean matter. The Station officer also told him that his request would be forwarded to Washington. CIA learned of the exact date of the coup shortly before it took place. During the attack on the Presidential Palace and its immediate aftermath, the Station's activities were limited to providing intelligence and situation reports.\n \n Allende's death occurred after the President refused an offer from the military to take him and his family out of the country. Available evidence indicates that President Allende committed suicide as putchist troops entered his offices. A credible source on Allende's death was Dr. Patricio Guijon, a physician who served on the President's medical staff. Guijon was in the Presidential Palace, La Moneda, with Allende during the assault and claimed that he witnessed Allende shoot himself with a rifle. The Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation in 1991 also concluded that Allende took his own life. There is no information to indicate that the CIA was involved in Allende's death.\"\n \n Source: The CIA\n \n \"A quarter century ago, the Church committee on intelligence activities reported that it found no evidence that the CIA was directly involved in a 1973 coup in Chile that toppled socialist President Salvadore Allende and brought Gen. Augusto Pinochet to power.\"\n \n Source:rememberchile.org\n \n \"There is no hard evidence of direct U.S. assistance to the coup, despite frequent allegations of such aid. Rather the United States - by its previous actions during Track II, its existing general posture of opposition to Allende, and the nature of its contacts with the Chilean military- probably gave the impression that it would not look with disfavor on a military coup. And U.S. officials in the years before 1973 may not always have succeeded in walking the thin line between monitoring indigenous coup plotting and actually stimulating it.\"\n \n Source: 94th Congress 1st Session COMMITTEE PRINT; COVERT ACTION IN CHILE 1963-1973, Otherwise known as THE CHURCH REPORT\n \n The purpose of the Church Committee, or the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activites was to investigate the operations of intelligence services and to investigate abuses. In 1976, after the Church Committee report was published, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was established to appropriate funds for military intelligence. One of its tasks is to provide direct oversight in the activities of the CIA, the NRO, the DIA, and the NSA.\n \n I know everyone wants to point to U.S. intelligence agencies for every evil deed that has ever been done, and grant it there have been some abuses. However, the strength of our nation depends on the activities of these organizations, and their ability to gather information. Certainly, this may require relationships with some of the worst humans imaginable, but if we are to know what such people might be conspiring, this remains a necessity. \n \n The workings of the intelligence networks of this country are highly complex and have had little oversight in the past. Measures have been implemented to curtail abuses that result from the lack of direct oversight, sometimes not for the betterment of our national security. This we have seen as the Toricelli Principle made it virtually impossible to use \"shady\" operators in the effort to develop human intelligence. The consequence of this idiocy has been indicated as the primary reason that our intelligence failed to protect us on September 11th, 2001. \n \n Should we continue to suspect organizations that operate under the power of secrecy? Certainly. However, this should be done in a responsible manner, for our very lives depend on the resources and efficiency of such networks. \n \n Efforts to undermine these agencies should also be suspect, as often times the agendas of those who seek to defile our military and intelligence communities are less than noble. More often than not people want to use examples like our involvement in Chile as reason for dismantling these machinations altogether. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the great harm the degenerates and the communists alike wish to commit in these efforts. \n \n One thing is for certain; the threat of leftist ideology is more of a concern to me than the threat of having intelligence services. Probably the thing I fear the most is the combination of the two things. What if the left where able to acquire the government and use these tools to their advantage, like they did in the Soviet Union, or like they are currently doing in China. If we can develop the protocol for obtaining sensitive information, and the networking capabilities to minimize the loss of this information to our enemies, like we did during the cold war, we can certainly develop the means to minimize abuses and provide responsible oversight. I think this has largely been done. Of course, no system is perfect, but the thought of no intelligence weighs heavier on my mind in this day and age.\n \n Ask yourself this. Under your proposed system of government, socialism, would the mechanisms have been developed to provide civilian oversight of such activities? Would the Church Report have been released? From what we have seen in the old communist block, and in China, the answer is no. Consider the fact that we have measures in place to guard against the abuses of intelligence gathering, especially considering our own citizens. In leftist governments, no such measures exist. In fact, the main scope of the information gathering by the government is to monitor the citizens within its borders. This is not the case in the United States, and I am thankful for that. God help us if your side wins, for the first thing a socialist government does is turn those devices inward on its own people. Consider that before you start barking about the United States intelligence services you miserable leeches.",

   "Here's the problem:\n Maybe the CIA killed/helped kill Allende. Maybe they didn't. Regardless, they still tried to overthrow a legitimate, democratically elected government, which is unethical, immoral, and immensely hypocritical. Is it any wonder that South America is abit suspicious about our opposition to Chavez today? It is because America hasn't wanted democracy in South America, they've wanted allies.",
