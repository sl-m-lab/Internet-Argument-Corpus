   "So I admit I'm a fan of AM radio in the mornings when I go into work. I don't like Lady Gaga so that really limits my options. \n \n Normally when I go into work none of the \"talk radio\" guys like Beck, Limbaugh, Hannity, Savage, Levine, etc are on but when I travel at least one of them is on the news channel I'm listening to. Rarely do I find a more \"liberal\" guy on the radio, I'm guessing they aren't on the main 50k Watt stations. \n \n Anyway, I often hear people go \"Glenn Beck is a conspiracy nut\" or \"Limbaugh is a big fat idiot\". I ask why and never really get an answer beyond that they just are. So I've listen to them probably a good number of times (I travel a lot) and have come to the same conclusion I do for EVERY person that is on TV or radio everyday; some things they say are intelligent, some are ok, some are idiotic, some are just flat out crazy. \n \n I'd like to see anyone on this forum be on the air for 600 hours a year and not look like a complete lunatic. Is the more likely scenario that the problem is NOT people spreading their opinion but rather people blindly hang on every word they say instead of saying \"hey, that seems like a good opinion, let me see if that is actually the case\". That's what I do and it seems to work out ok. I've learned from Beck and from Olbermann. From Chris Matthews to Bill Oreilly. \n \n Anyway, your thoughts?",

They twist things to make them sensational. That is what pays their bills.\n\n \n It's a bit more than that. You have to have outrage but you also have to present it in a way that is entertaining to people. People like Howard Stern and Don Imus do this well while others come across like your mother nagging you and they go out of business.\n \n I also think you are a little off about them not checking facts. I believe they do most of the time but have a tendency to slant them or present a false conclusion based upon them. For example someone will get on and say \"a report has come out showing the stimulus didn't do a darn thing...therefore I was right about cutting taxes\". I'm component enough to take that and go \"wow, I didn't hear about that report I should check it out...oh, and that last part doesn't follow so I'll ignore it\". Seems I'm in the minority there but most people tend to be followers so I don't really fault a radio show or TV show guy for that. \n \n At the end of the day I'd rather listen to someone's opinion and understand it is just that than only listen to a guy drone on about something I would rather read on the internet to begin with. Jon Stewart isn't nuts, he is a comedian. Bill Oreilly isn't nuts, he is a TV opinion columnist. Perhaps we should just take things a little less serious :)",

The biggest difference in liberal talk show hosts versus conservatives ones is that (and this isn't always the case) the liberal ones are more downers. This is always surprising to me because the \"conservative\" ones are more talking about how are \"this\" close to the end. I guess it is all in the delivery.",

   "Why do you think everyone knows about Limbaugh?\nBecause he is by far the most popular talk radio host in the nation. \n \n \nThey know about him because he is a sensationalizing nut bag propagandist.\nRead my first post. You'd call yourself a sensationalizing nut bag propagandist if you were on the radio everyday for 20 years. \n \n He says things that are so overwhelmingly stupid that you would have to live in a sealed lead box orbiting Pluto not to hear about him.\n \n \nIf a crazy person gives you advise that you don't already agree with you won't listen to him even if he is right.\nI guess that depends on what we define as crazy. Do I think Rush Limbaugh or Ed Shultz are crazy? No, in fact, they are obviously not. Would I consider the guy in my town who talks to himself crazy, yes, and he should get help for it.\n \n \nWhat are you really doing when you listen to your favorite conservative talk show host?\nThe same thing I do when I listen to my favorite liberal talk show host....driving.\n \n \nYou are listening to exactly what you want to hear, this reinforces your faith in those ideas and makes it very difficult for you to change your mind if new information is brought to light.\nSo kinda like this forum.\n \n \nIn other words, it's bad for you.\nWell this brings up some issues for you...",
