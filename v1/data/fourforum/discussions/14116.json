What he meant to say was that paedophilia is not a Catholic disease but a homosexual perversion. In other words be rid of homosexual priests and bingo! No more paedophilia in the Church. I agree with him for I don't know of any cases of priests molesting girls so celibacy is not the cause. So homosexuals in the military is OK unless they lower the age for serving in the Army, but this will never happen.",
