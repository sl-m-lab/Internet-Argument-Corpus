   "There's a huge hole in evolutionary theory and I'm about to exploit it.\n \n I've mentioned this before, but truly, mountains of books could be written on this subject. The subject, of course, is the illusion of evolution. My contention is that much of what is perceived as \"evolution\" is not actually not evolution at all.\n \n Part of the problem 20th century scientists had was their definition of \"evolution.\" Intellectual wars have been fought for the past 150 years about where new traits come from and how they get passed on. Regardless, each side has tried to explain how the information from the environment gets transmitted to offspring. On one side you have Darwinists, who claim that evolution is a two-step process. First there's random genetic mutation, and that's followed up by non-random natural selection....the two combine to have the effect of transmitting environmental \"fitness\" to their offspring. Lamarckian inheritance, on the other hand, is a one-step process where the organism simply perceives the environment, adapts phenotypically and passes on these adaptations to their progeny.\n \n But there's a hole. A gaping hole that nobody has seemed to exploit. And this hole bypasses both theories. What's the hole? The hole is that inheritance of new traits is not necessary for \"evolution.\" In other words, populational evolution does not require traits to be \"passed on.\" This mantra is a giant straw man, as you will soon see, because much -- if not all -- of what we see in the field is merely a matter of environmental evolution.\n \n \n The Environmental Evolution Revolution\n \n The reality is that a change in phenotype is observed as evolution in the field and in the fossil record. But there is no way to tell from the fossils -- or from non-controlled scientific experiments -- whether new traits are caused by variation arising in the genotype or only from environmental effects acting on the phenotype. Not only that, but there's also no way to tell without close inspection if these traits are inherited or acquired. \n \n It's well known that animal embryo development brings about a collaboration between the genetic program, internal signals from the mother, and external signals from the environment. Somehow the embryo processes this information and emerges accordingly. Therefore, the same genome can emerge with different phenotypes depending on environment or external circumstance. This is known as differentiation, and is simply the convergence of an organism's genes and environment during development. Moths and butterflies are perfect example of this phenomenon.\n \n http://unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm\n \n As well, the relationship between the developing organism and the environment doesn't stop after being born into the world. Newly-borns' bones are often very soft, pliable and shapable. My contention is that shape and form is quickly molded in the first days, weeks, or months of life. For example, an animal's diet can quickly shape his morphology, as in this tadpole example:\n \n http://www.citeulike.org/user/balicea/article/454684\n \n Depending on their diet, individuals of both species develop into either a small-headed omnivore morph, which feeds mostly on detritus, or a large-headed carnivore morph, which specializes on shrimp.\n \n As well, tadpoles can not only change the size and shape of their heads, it's also known that the presence of predators can influence their tail size, shape, color, hatch times and general size of the organism. \n \n (Could this be why Neanderthals had their brow ridges? Since they had a slightly protruding face (as many in Europe still do), the exertion that no-doubt came from eating a diet heavy in meat (vigorous chewing) could very well have put pressure on the facial plates and brow ridges -- and as youngsters with soft bones, this diet help dictate their morphology.)\n \n But it's not just tadpoles........\n \n As well, rodents, will dine on a variety of seeds and nuts...as youngsters, if a population of mice come across a new food supply, they are all likely to all develop a morphology that suits such a diet. If this food is different than what their parents' ate, their morphology could be uniquely different than their parents. This new morphology would follow them until adulthood. If the food supply stuck around long enough time, it could give the appearance that the population was \"evolving.\" But genetics would have nothing to do with it - instead, it would simply be a cultural, environmental phenomenon. It's an environmental evolution, of sorts. Of course this leaves natural selection out of a job because the entire population would be evolving new, beneficial morphologies without it. Not only that but it bypasses the ridiculous premise that science has constructed for itself --- which says that new, beneficial traits have to be \"passed on.\" This is a bogus premise from the very start because it's not necessary for traits to be \"passed on\" for new morphologies to carry forward into future generations -- all that's needed is, in this case, for a specific diet to continue to be available to future generations -- which, of course, would carry on those particular traits.\n \n And how many things can influence a development of a new life? We know diet does, but staying with mice, it's recently been shown that mouse mothers who lick their offspring can effect their brains in beneficial ways.\n \n \n http://www.rachel.org/library/getfile.cfm?ID=531 \n \n For reasons that are not well understood, methylation patterns are absent from very specific regions of the rat genome before birth. Twelve hours after rats are born, a new methylation pattern is formed. The mother rat then starts licking her pups. The first week is a critical period, Dr. Meaney said. Pups that are licked show decreased methylation patterns in an area of the brain that helps them handle stress. Faced with challenges later in life, they tend to be more confident and less fearful. \n \n \"We think licking affects a methylation enzyme that is ready and waiting for mother to start licking,\" Dr. Meaney said. In perilous times, mothers may be able to set the stress reactivity of their offspring by licking less. When there are fewer dangers around, the mothers may lick more. \n \n Really the sky's the limit; diet, terrain, movement, predators, weather, availability of resources, etc. Life is not about genes, Life is about life. The designer didn't create animals adapted to specific environments, He created them with an adaptive ability to evolve with a changing environment.\n \n Depending on the size of available prey, snakes have adaptive jaw sizes to accommodate themselves.\n \n http://www.kingsnake.com/aho/pdf/menu3/rickshine/adaptivesnakes.pdf\n \n The morphology of organisms\n is generally well matched to\n their environment, presumably\n because expression of their\n genes is tailored either at the population\n or the individual level to\n suit local conditions: for example,\n snake populations that persistently\n encounter large prey may accumulate\n gene mutations that specify a\n large head size, or head growth\n may be increased in individual\n snakes to meet local demands\n (adaptive developmental plasticity)\n \n Of course this very well could be how finches evolve their new beaks. And of course science has never bothered doing tests on this, but it's not that much of a stretch to imagine that as juveniles, these birds exerted various physiological pressures trying to stick their beaks into small holes or by eating softer seeds. As youngsters their diet probably dictated specific bill shapes.\n \n This is not \"evolution\" it's an adaptive response. Of course, some say new beak shapes could have formed during development, but either way, selection is not required....it would be similar situation to the butterfly example I gave above. This of course, is just another example where it is not necessary for traits to be \"passed on.\" Traits need not be passed on to give the illusion of populational evolution.\n \n Stephen Jay Gould wasted quite a bit of ink while he was alive writing about the evolution of snails. Little did he know that snails are morphologically adaptive to predators and can alter their shell nearly at will. \n \n http://www.pitt.edu/~jthst21/Hoverman.html\n \n It's just another case of environmental evolution that has nothing to do with the \"passing on\" of traits...it's simply a matter of environmental cues acting on the genetic program.\n \n The possibilities for this phenomenon are incredible. For every animal there must be hundreds of possibilities - maybe more. Who knows. \n \n \n And what's interesting is Gould's explanation for why Lamarckism is false...this is very interesting and ties in directly to this:\n \n \"For Lamarckism is a theory of directed variation. I have heard no evidence that any of these biochemical mechanisms leads to the preferential incorporation of favorable genetic information. Perhaps this is possible; perhaps it even happens. If so, it would be an exciting new development, and truly Lamarckian. \n \n But so far, we have found nothing in the workings of Mendelism or in the biochemistry of DNA to encourage a belief that environments or acquired adaptations can direct sex cells to mutate in specified directions. How could colder weather \"tell\" the chromosomes of a sperm or egg to produce mutations for longer hair?\"\n \n Of course, Gould has set up a giant straw man that has been repeated relentlessly. The straw man is that it's not necessary pass on traits, for the reasons stated above....and it is not necessary that \"environments or acquired adaptations can direct sex cells to mutate in specific directions.\" Life gets around that little scenario because each life is individually adaptive...and adaptations start during development -- where his eyes couldn't see -- or didn't want to. Life changes so rapidly -- if you blink you miss it!\n \n Stephen, I know you're dead, but if you can somehow hear me, please note you have made a great error.....you have a giant hole in your theory, which I have just exploited. It's called \"The Environmental Evolution Revolution.\"\n \n Not only have I undercut your snails but I've undercut most of what you and all your foolish friends say in your books. Evolution surely has a heritable component, but a huge portion of what is perceived as \"evolution\" in the field is not that at all. It's merely an illusion...and upon close inspection it disappears altogether....just like your theory. You see, there is NO EVIDENCE for natural selection sifting through random mutations. What is seen in the field today is not evidence for that, it's simply evidence that the environment is working on the genetic code of each creature. \n \n Massimo Pigliucci: \"Genes by themselves do literally nothing. Organisms do not begin with a bunch of genes that generate everything else: they need a set of environmental conditions . . .\" ",

   "There's a huge hole in evolutionary theory and I'm about to exploit it.\n \n I've mentioned this before, but truly, mountains of books could be written on this subject. The subject, of course, is the illusion of evolution. My contention is that much of what is perceived as \"evolution\" is not actually not evolution at all.\n \n Part of the problem 20th century scientists had was their definition of \"evolution.\" Intellectual wars have been fought for the past 150 years about where new traits come from and how they get passed on. Regardless, each side has tried to explain how the information from the environment gets transmitted to offspring. On one side you have Darwinists, who claim that evolution is a two-step process. First there's random genetic mutation, and that's followed up by non-random natural selection....the two combine to have the effect of transmitting environmental \"fitness\" to their offspring. Lamarckian inheritance, on the other hand, is a one-step process where the organism simply perceives the environment, adapts phenotypically and passes on these adaptations to their progeny.\n \n But there's a hole. A gaping hole that nobody has seemed to exploit. And this hole bypasses both theories. What's the hole? The hole is that inheritance of new traits is not necessary for \"evolution.\" In other words, populational evolution does not require traits to be \"passed on.\" This mantra is a giant straw man, as you will soon see, because much -- if not all -- of what we see in the field is merely a matter of environmental evolution.\n \n The reality is that a change in phenotype is observed as evolution in the field and in the fossil record. But there is no way to tell from the fossils -- or from non-controlled scientific experiments -- whether new traits are caused by variation arising in the genotype or only from environmental effects acting on the phenotype. Not only that, but there's also no way to tell without close inspection if these traits are inherited or acquired. \n \n It's well known that animal embryo development brings about a collaboration between the genetic program, internal signals from the mother, and external signals from the environment. Somehow the embryo processes this information and emerges accordingly. Therefore, the same genome can emerge with different phenotypes depending on environment or external circumstance. This is known as differentiation, and is simply the convergence of an organism's genes and environment during development. Moths and butterflies are perfect example of this phenomenon.\n \n As well, tadpoles can not only change the size and shape of their heads, it's also known that the presence of predators can influence their tail size, shape, color, hatch times and general size of the organism. \n \n (Could this be why Neanderthals had their brow ridges? Since they had a slightly protruding face (as many in Europe still do), the exertion that no-doubt came from eating a diet heavy in meat (vigorous chewing) could very well have put pressure on the facial plates and brow ridges -- and as youngsters with soft bones, this diet help dictate their morphology.)\n \n But it's not just tadpoles........\n \n As well, rodents, will dine on a variety of seeds and nuts...as youngsters, if a population of mice come across a new food supply, they are all likely to all develop a morphology that suits such a diet. If this food is different than what their parents' ate, their morphology could be uniquely different than their parents. This new morphology would follow them until adulthood. If the food supply stuck around long enough time, it could give the appearance that the population was \"evolving.\" But genetics would have nothing to do with it - instead, it would simply be a cultural, environmental phenomenon. It's an environmental evolution, of sorts. Of course this leaves natural selection out of a job because the entire population would be evolving new, beneficial morphologies without it. Not only that but it bypasses the ridiculous premise that science has constructed for itself --- which says that new, beneficial traits have to be \"passed on.\" This is a bogus premise from the very start because it's not necessary for traits to be \"passed on\" for new morphologies to carry forward into future generations -- all that's needed is, in this case, for a specific diet to continue to be available to future generations -- which, of course, would carry on those particular traits.\n \n \"We think licking affects a methylation enzyme that is ready and waiting for mother to start licking,\" Dr. Meaney said. In perilous times, mothers may be able to set the stress reactivity of their offspring by licking less. When there are fewer dangers around, the mothers may lick more. [/COLOR]\n \n Really the sky's the limit; diet, terrain, movement, predators, weather, availability of resources, etc. Life is not about genes, Life is about life. The designer didn't create animals adapted to specific environments, He created them with an adaptive ability to evolve with a changing environment.\n \n This is not \"evolution\" it's an adaptive response. Of course, some say new beak shapes could have formed during development, but either way, selection is not required....it would be similar situation to the butterfly example I gave above. This of course, is just another example where it is not necessary for traits to be \"passed on.\" Traits need not be passed on to give the illusion of populational evolution.\n \n \n And what's interesting is Gould's explanation for why Lamarckism is false...this is very interesting and ties in directly to this:\n \n \n Of course, Gould has set up a giant straw man that has been repeated relentlessly. The straw man is that it's not necessary pass on traits, for the reasons stated above....and it is not necessary that \"environments or acquired adaptations can direct sex cells to mutate in specific directions.\" Life gets around that little scenario because each life is individually adaptive...and adaptations start during development -- where his eyes couldn't see -- or didn't want to. Life changes so rapidly -- if you blink you miss it!\n \n Stephen, I know you're dead, but if you can somehow hear me, please note you have made a great error.....you have a giant hole in your theory, which I have just exploited. It's called \"The Environmental Evolution Revolution.\"\n \n Not only have I undercut your snails but I've undercut most of what you and all your foolish friends say in your books. Evolution surely has a heritable component, but a huge portion of what is perceived as \"evolution\" in the field is not that at all. It's merely an illusion...and upon close inspection it disappears altogether....just like your theory. You see, there is NO EVIDENCE for natural selection sifting through random mutations. What is seen in the field today is not evidence for that, it's simply evidence that the environment is working on the genetic code of each creature. \n \n\n \n This is a very interesting post. You show a lot of knowledge and insight.\n \n It is quite long and I don't think I understood all of it. Could you mention what is the most important point?\n \n You make a good point that \"evolution is merely an illusion.\" I am thinking about this and I want to ask you what you see as the ramifications from this. Looking forward to seeing more of your posts.",

   "I am new to this. It seems that many posters do not take you seriously. This seems unfair. You must be very frustrated after putting so much intelligence and effort into gathering this information.\n\n He is not taken seriously because he gathers information only with his Morton's demon in full control.\n supersport ploughs around the intarwebs, looking for anything he can crib and misrepresent. He's gotten really good at cribbing and misrepresenting, but that doesn't mean that he can't be refuted... or hasn't been refuted... or hasn't been refuted repeatedly... or hasn't been refuted repeatedly on numerous discussion boards... If supersport spent half as much effort reading and understanding what bona fide scientists tell him as he spends looking for \"support\" and figuring out how to spin it, we wouldn't be having this conversation.\n \n Let's put it this way. Suppose you have a friend named Fred who is in your section of organic chemistry. One day your friend comes in and says, \"Dude! The prof's off his rocker! I have proof that he's lying to us!\" You ask Fred for some supporting evidence, and he disappears for a while.\n A while later, you see Fred again. \"Dude,\" he says, \"I told you. Check this out. Turns out that there are ways besides the so-called 'Grignard reaction' to lengthen carbon chains. Wittig! It's all a ruse! He's been telling us about this, but that's not what actually happens! (And man, don't get me started on keto-enol tautomerization; that one's a real doozy!)\" You stare at him blankly, point him to the appropriate scientific papers, even invite him into the lab to run the experiment himself, but all he does is tout his own brilliance and avoid every piece of evidence you provide.\n Finally, Fred comes into lecture and tells you about his amazing theory that will totally overthrow all of organic chemistry. It turns out that sulfur can catenate, too, he says. This completely destroys the scientific conspiracy that organic chemistry is really about carbon compounds. In fact, Fred ends up approaching the professor -- someone who has extensive education, training, and experience in the field -- and tells the professor outright that Fred has uncovered the scientists' evil plan to corrupt mankind and indoctrinate poor little college students into \"Grignardism.\"\n Incredibly, Fred doesn't seem to notice that other students, the professor, graduate assistants, scientific articles, and common sense all contradict him. When presented with these problems, Fred pooh-poohs them away as a fabricated part of the conspiratorial establishment, as science as a whole has only one purpose: promoting Grignardism.\n Fred repeats this every week, with the same argument every time, dressed up just a little bit different. Every week, dozens upon dozens of refutations pour in, inundating little Fred with questions he can't answer and observations he can't explain. When even Fred -- the practiced little spinster that he is -- can no longer pretend in the face of such overwhelming evidence, he disappears again... Only to start anew the next week.\n \n How long until you no longer take Fred seriously?\n \n Do you think I've made up this whole scenario? Head over to IIDB and search for threads started by supersport. My story is a sadly accurate representation, although it is much too short to instill in you the understanding of the full depth of supersport's... \"behavior.\"\n IIDB has numerous practicing scientists and generally well-educated people; they thrashed sport to pieces every single time. He finally made himself a nuisance and repeatedly broke forum rules so that he'd be banned and could claim that moderators kicked him off because they couldn't debate him.\n \n \nI am still sympathetic to your first post, and I can understand your frustration from being attacked like here, but I am disturbed when you say \"Science is a joke\". Did you really mean this?\n\n Yes. Because evolution requires an old earth, supersport has lumped geology into the evil conspiracy. As our best explanations for the formation of the earth appeal to cosmology, that field as well as astronomy fall within the realm of quack science, according to supersport. In fact, every scientific discipline that has any connection whatsoever to evolution must be corrupt; obviously, chemistry is one of them (we can't make glycogen or DNA without magical, \"atheistic\" polymerization, right?).\n \n \nI looked at this site. You seem mostly concerned about how much attention you get.\n\n Yep. This is why he posts the same stuff over and over and over on as many forums as he can.\n \n \nThis is OK, becuase if your posts really show that evolution is an illusion, then that is going to upset a lot of people. Including my professors.\n\n I still find this funny. The first scientist/professor to disprove evolution would be unimaginably rich and famous. He/She could do whatever s/he wanted from retire a millionaire or continue anti-evolution research. People on this board (as well as on IIDB) have proposed experiments based on supersport's claims that would test both his ideas and evolution. While we don't realistically expect supersport to have the connections or capability to do some of them (e.g. peppered moth experiment), supersport refuses to do even the simplest of them (The Chihuahua Challenge).\n \n \nBeing refuted by organized groups with an agenda they support does not make Supwersports ideas wrong. You call it garbage.\n\n As I said earlier, it is garbage. He can't back it up. As a scientist-in-training, you know that real science requires research and evidential support. supersport has neither. The \"support\" that he cites -- when read in their entirety -- do little or nothing to actually support him. On one forum (mentioned earlier on this forum), the author of the scientific paper that supersport cited actually joined the board to tell supersport to stop misrepresenting his research.\n The only \"agenda\" that the scientific community has is to find the truth. The fact that the scientific community trounces supersport's points nonstop is not what makes his points wrong; his points are wrong on their own merit, and they'd be wrong regardless of anybody's refutations of them.\n \n \nI AM interested in what Supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society.\n\n That's certainly your right, but supersport is interested in hawking a religious agenda, not a scientific one. He may want it disguised as a scientific one, but a perusal of his posts here bely that desire.\n \n \nUntil I hear from SS, I give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\n No need to wait, really. Again, you don't need to take my word for it. Search 4forums. Search IIDB. Search CARM. Search TWeb. See what he's done so far. If after that you really find him more credible than \"Fred,\" we need to talk.\n \n (I smell something fishy here...)",

The evo-babbler is not interested in serious, honest debate, but instead their ultimate goal, sub-conscious or not, is to waste your time. They inundate you with a conveyor belt of red herrings, strawmen, and trivial arguing over words. This alert will thus do a great service to both the owner of this forum, and the many readers from both sides of the debate who pass through.\n \n An evo-babbler is usually someone trained at the alter of Talk.Origins, a web site that is a bastion of evo-babble that trains up little warriors of evo-babble, who go out with their new evo-babble rancor in hand and invade various discussion boards and web sites with, you guessed it, their evo-babble! It is very easy to identify and catalog an evo-babbler. Look for these top 10 classic symptoms to occur within the first few posts they make (note that it is not the substance of their argument, but how they argue that identifies them). \n \n 10) Calls you a liar. Too common an occurrence to easily attribute to a Talk.Origins evo-babbler, so there is only a 30% chance you have an evo-babbler on your hands. You must look for other symptoms.\n \n 9) Has an insatiable appetite for red herrings. When you end up replying to two or more unrelated topics within your first response, there is an 80% probability you have an authentic evo-babbler on your hands!\n \n 8) Quibbles over trivial things (equivocation), such as a word in your post. This is good sign you have a genuine evo-babbler in your mist, and if it happens early and often, it rings in at an impressive 80% probability!\n \n 7) Reasons in a circle. The evo-babbler Mike Hager provided numerous examples during his perch in the guestbook, including this classic \"Since the deity is unreal, it is clear that it could have created nothing.\" Circular reasoning is common among evolutionists, so this one only rings in at 40% probability, so you must look for other signs to confirm the evo-babble disease.\n \n 6) Quick to invoke Occam's Razor and declare victory. A solid 75% probability you have an evo-babbler in your midst.\n \n 5) Fond of strawman arguments. This is actually prevalent among evolutionists who do not worship at the Talk.Origins alter, so you only have a 50% chance he/she is a genuine evo-babbler. Look for other symptoms to confirm the evo-babbler diagnosis. However, if the evo-babbler erected the strawman by putting words into your mouth, the disease has metastasized to stage 3 and you have an 85% probability the individual has been infected with evo-babble-itis!\n \n 4) Tries to get you to comment on what other creationists said in some other forum. About a 75% probability of evo-babble authenticity!\n \n 3) Claims you are quoting out of context. An all time Talk.Origins classic! 80% probability!\n \n 2) Asks you to quote from the proper scientific literature (i.e only pro-evolution literature). This brings a solid 90% probability you have a genuine evo-babbler on your hands!\n \n 1) And the number one sure sign - ballyhoos articles from the Talk.Origins repository, often with little knowledge what the article says. Ironically they often do this after invoking #2 above! At Talk.Origins you will be fortunate to find 1 scholarly article out of every 50. If they do this with their first post, it registers in at an impressive 80% accuracy! If they ballyhoo more than one reference to Talk.Origins in the same post, you have a dead-ringer evo-babbler at 99.98% probability!\"\n \n \n Yours truly,\n Fred Williams\n ---------------\n \n the babblers on this forum do 9 out of 10 of these on a regular basis -- many evolutionists here commit multiple infrractions on the same post.

   "10) Calls you a liar.\n\n Don't lie, and you won't get called a liar. It's as simple as that. But we don't simply accuse someone of lying and leave it at that, unless it is the creationist making the positive claim and failing to back it up. Check supersport's \"big debate\" thread. I call him a liar quite a few times, but I back it up every time.\n \n \n9) Has an insatiable appetite for red herrings.\n\n \"Two unrelated topics\" might arise in a number of ways. The most common way is that the creationist has thrown out a slew of nonsense not restricted to any.. well, any coherence at all, so a complete response will sometime intersect disciplines. Another common ways this happens is that the two subjects are actually related, but the creationist's lack of understanding of said topics make him or her think that there are red herrings involved.\n \n \n8) Quibbles over trivial things (equivocation), such as a word in your post.\n\n We have a lot of this here. marc -- our favorite -- insists that evolution must refer to industrial change. This is clearly not what biologists mean when we talk about evolution. For somebody to pretend that it is, and for somebody else to pretend that objecting to this equivocation is bad practice -- is asinine.\n Catching up quickly to marc, however, is wabbit, what with his Little Golden Dictionary and entropy that isn't entropy. Hard to port!\n \n \n7) Reasons in a circle.\n\n This is a fallacy no matter who does it; however, if one were to do a tally, one would find that it's clearly the creationists leading the pack in this category.\n \n \n6) Quick to invoke Occam's Razor and declare victory.\n\n We may invoke Occam's Razor (It slices! It dices! It removes unnecessary supernatural entities! [RIP, Winace :( ]), but that doesn't mean that your points aren't slaughtered elsewhere. marc is keen on appealing to higher forces, but sport usually keeps the conversation elsewhere, such that we can stick to the (numerous) scientific refutations of his arguments.\n \n \n5) Fond of strawman arguments. \n\n If you think this is a problem among evolutionists, you haven't read this forum. Go ahead. Take a look around. sport is one of the worst; he argues against a theory he doesn't understand. Again, see the recent \"big debate\" thread to see sport misrepresenting evolutionary theory so he can try to knock it down with a pitchfork.\n \n \n4) Tries to get you to comment on what other creationists said in some other forum.\n\n No, sport gives us plenty of ammunition all on his own. We can say the same for marc.\n \n \n3) Claims you are quoting out of context.\n\n It might be bad if the claim is bare, but we have no problem providing entire quotes and/or links to entire quotes so readers can see for themselves. sport is a practiced quote-miner. If he wants to see the quote-mining accusations stop, he should stop mining.\n \n \n2) Asks you to quote from the proper scientific literature \n\n Yep, it sure is unfair that scientists want reviewed, critiqued, and confirmed accounts of actual experimentation and observation before accepting ideas.\n \n \n1) And the number one sure sign - ballyhoos articles from the Talk.Origins repository, often with little knowledge what the article says.\n\n This is a joke, right? sport is our all-time favorite for citing articles that contradict him. He popularized argumentum ad googlem on IIDB and -- the vast majority of the time -- reading the entire article he cites reveals that his representation of it is dishonest, or at best mistaken.\n \n I find it hilarious that creationists have seen these so much and yet refuse to consider the possibility that they're seeing these objections for a reason.",

All of the fossil material was rehydrated during the same process that removed the mineral components of the bone. They were then buffered, and also some were fixed. The related press reports have created the impression that there are large features with the characteristics of fresh tissue. This is not true.
