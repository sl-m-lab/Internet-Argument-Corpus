   "...obviously.\n \n Yet another report stating how Medicare and Social Security are slowly bleeding us dry. \n \n http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/la-na-entitle26mar26,1,513148.story\n \n \nWASHINGTON -- With the presidential campaign going full tilt, a new government report on a big national problem is usually followed by volleys of rhetoric from the candidates. But on Tuesday, when the annual report on the precarious state of Medicare and Social Security came out, the reaction was not exactly deafening.\n \n The two programs on which millions of elderly Americans depend are apparently just too hot to handle -- especially since any realistic solution is likely to involve a politically unpalatable mix of higher taxes and lower benefits.\n\n \n \nEverybody knows that there are a couple of 800-pound gorillas under the rug, but nobody wants to talk about them because that is not the route to the Oval Office,\" said economist Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute public policy center. \"The situation is unsustainable in the long run, but the long run is in the future, and our political system operates very much in the present.\"\n\n \n Just to clarify the idiotic point that is always raised....stopping the war will not change the insolvency of Medicare and Social Security.\n \n Furthermore, how do we plan on adding a universal health care plan when we can't afford the entitlement programs we have now.\n \n Surely this thread will be ignored by a majority of the forum users just like how it is ignored in the US population and by our politicians. Bye bye US economy! emoticon_xbye",

   "And your issue with this is just exactly what?\nWell for starters you end up driving our economy into recession since that is a very high tax jump which would probably cause many folks to loss their mortgages and not pay other bills. Second, we would end up having one of the highest tax burdens of any country. Third, it doesn't solve the problem and would probably result in another tax increase down the road. Fourth, it wouldn't even give you universal health care because we are only talking about Medicare. \n \n I could go on.\n \n \nI, for one, would be very happy to pay to the government in taxes what I am currently paying in health insurance premiums which go to support the clones and drones who have nothing whatsoever to do with the delivery of health care.\nBy all means donate more. The federal government could use your help.\n \n \nWhether you like it or not, the fact remains that Medicare is the country's most efficiently run health care delivery system.\nWhich explains why it is bankrupt right? Have you ever worked with Medicare by the way or for that matter the federal government? Efficiency is not exactly the strong point. For one the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan does nothing more than cost us money while providing no benefit to the poor who actually need the drugs at a lower cost. The second problem is that medicare has no method to actually help the people under the plan who have different needs. Medicare simply will pay something it shouldn't be or not pay what it should be. The problem gets worse when you look at those covered for special needs (mentally handicapped for example). If all that isn't enough, the GAO has had the Medicare program on its \"High Risk List\" since 1990. The GAO also reports that the Medicare Advantage plan has increased costs for no reason as well(GAO-08-522T). I don't even need to get into the fraud that the GAO reports.\n \n Now please show some evidence that Medicare works \"efficiently\".",

This is probably the easier of things to fix but would cost a bunch....Medicare is the immediate death.\n\n \n Medicare has the same problem right now, which is that even though we ALL knew that it was going under, they kept stealing the trust fund money. Why anybody would think that stealing all the reserves from an already obviously underfunded program is beyond me, but they did it. \n \n The thing about medicare is that it is mostly legislative barriers that keep it so horribly inefficient and, ironically enough, it is the people who argue in favor of \"free market health care\" keeping Medicare from engaging in \"free market health care\" that make it that way.\n \n Look at attempts to bargain with drug companies and health care providers or example. Every time they have tried to modify medicare so they can negotiate with these folks, it gets shot down by people who yell \"Socialized medicine\" when the reality of the matter is that EVERY private insurance company negotiates with drug makers and providers to get the best value for their $$$. Apparently in some peoples minds the idea of allowing medicare to do what EVERY private insurance company does would be a full descent into socialism. \n \n Let Medicare negotiate with drug companies an put together a provider network like EVERY private insurance company, and they could cut their costs in HALF in the first year. \n \n Do these XXXXXX who keep yelling \"FREE MARKET\" have any idea at all what a free market is or how one works?? IF we assume that there is such a thing as \"free market health care\" (and there is NOT, but we will assume for the purpose of this exercise that we are all dumb enough to believe in such a thing) then nothing could be more \"free market\" than the ultimate consumer (that being the entity paying the bill) negotiating with the service providers. What we have now is akin to believing that dickering with the salesman when you go to buy a car equates to communism.\n \n People are stupid. \n \n \nAnd what was the first thing you heard from Congress?

Really I think that the best thing we can say for our politicians is that they have an INCREDIBLY ability to pretend to be surprised when inevitable events occur. Iraq war... \"blah blah blah there is no way we could have predicted blah blah blah\" The housing mess \"We believed it would remain contained to the housing sector blah blah nobody ever thought blah blah\". And the american people, whose favorite hobby is apparently having sunshine blown up their collective butts, smile and nod and then when the inevitable happens they actually ARE surprised because they have based their entire reality on what these lying dufuses have told them. \n \n It is pathetic. We are indeed the new rome, and our failure will be brought about by the utter stupidity of the American people.",
