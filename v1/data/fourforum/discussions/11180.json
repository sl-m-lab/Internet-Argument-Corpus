   "Interesting, many of those who think the govt. should be acting as the great equalizer apparently don't really live that out in practice ...\n \n \"Arthur Brooks, the author of \"Who Really Cares,\" says that \"when you look at the data, it turns out the conservatives give about 30 percent more.\" He adds, \"And incidentally, conservative-headed families make slightly less money.\"\n \n And he says the differences in giving goes beyond money, pointing out that conservatives are 18 percent more likely to donate blood. He says this difference is not about politics, but about the different way conservatives and liberals view government.\n \n \"You find that people who believe it's the government's job to make incomes more equal, are far less likely to give their money away,\" Brooks says. In fact, people who disagree with the statement, \"The government has a basic responsibility to take care of the people who can't take care of themselves,\" are 27 percent more likely to give to charity.\"More at http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2682730\n For that matter, I don't recall Jesus, or any of the NT writings ever teaching we should levy caps on salaries. The teaching of Jesus was levied AT the rich, to give to the poor, but he didn't teach that govt. should force the rich to do so. Better to encourage people who have lots of money to be generous and help the poor. That is more core to Christian belief. Of course the study in the article applies to the U.S. and your guys are talking more about the UK, but I don't see how the same thing doesn't probably apply.",

   "I wonder if the Archbishop would be just as eager to limit the apparent income of his church's leaders as well. Some of them enjoy pleasures equal to or greater than the highly paid CEOs. Along with the CEOs salaries, cap the Arch Bishop's apparent income by restricting his excessive lifestyle and free perks.\n \n If the church is to interfere with the running of all business, let the church lose its tax free status (if it exists in the UK...do you blokes operate the same way we do regarding church and state or are you still kissing the King's ring and the Bishop's XXX at the same time?)\n \n I favor less pay for CEOs and more pay for worker bees myself, but I do not believe salaries should be mandated by government...or churches.\n \n \n Here's a link to illuminate the Archbishop a bit more. He appears to favor communism and is getting some people rather riled up about it.

They can sit in the golden chairs, have all their clothes cleaned at the expense of \"the Church\" (in a sense...at the expense of \"the tax payers\").

The workers are working harder, the products are getting made and the owner is getting richer while providing more and more jobs for workers. That's capitalism for ya.\n \n Maybe a factor in Comrade Williams' bent toward communism is that he sees himself as one of the ruling few...one who will never have to really work and will always have servants of the government to drive him around and polish his boots.",
