Otherwise he would be capable of creating a five sided square, or a spherical triangle, just an expansion on the idea of the immovable rock. For god to be able to create a five sided square, he would have to change the definition of square. But of course, if god is omnipotenet, he has to be capable of failing. This is a paradoxal concept, because for god to be imnipotent, he would then have to be capable of making a five sided square as well as failing to create a five sided square.\n \n Unfortunately, on most debates I've read or participated in arguing over the existance of a god or not, the people on the religious side continued to state that god was not possible of being comprehended and was capable of doing anything, which just can't be well argued against because the opposing theory is that god is capable of anything and required faith instead of evidence.\n \n The reason people argue against the idea of a god is that the entire concept creates paradoxes like described above. The idea of a god was also created by men, for men. There is also no modern proof of god related miracles. For all we know, Jesus seemed to walk on water because he knew where the stones were that neared the surface of the water, and he could have used them as stepping stones. Religion is based on myth, and science is based on fact.\n \n \nWhat's really sad is even if someone doesn't agree that God is real, one would think they might have enough respect of other people to not denigrate and mock beliefs that they hold dear and are important to them.\n\n That would be very nice, however, each group is equally guilty of attacking the other. The last time I saw a group like \"Godless Americans,\" - a group devoted to a true separation of church and state - being interviewed on a news channel, they were immediately dismissed as radicals, even though the motive makes perfect if you analyze it, many small political problems dealing with religion could be avoided.",

   "You are making a sweeping generalization to a very large and very diverse group of people when who I think you are really referring to are the more conservative christians.\n\n The overwhelming majority of Christians are ignorant of the Bible, grossly ignorant of ante-Nicene history, and totally ignorant of the 2nd Temple Period Judaism. On the occassional Sunday they park their brains at the door of their church, listen to a platitudinous sermon, collect their brains on exit, and then go on their way. What you refer to as \"the more conservative christians\" might also be viewed as 'the more consistant Christians', i.e., the ones that actually try to believe what the Scriptures actually say.\n \n There is, of course, a third group - Christian intellectuals (of all stripes) who sincerely struggle with the texts and their historical context. Sadly, they are unknown by the majority and contemptuously dismissed by the minority.\n \n As for the other side, I think many atheists are frustrated with and hostile towards willful ignorance and backwardness. Frankly, many find you to be an embarrassment - a bit like waking up one morning to discover that one's parents really do believe in the Easter Bunny.",

Look, I know, you have every right to be upset (and I am as well) with people who cause these sorts of problems in schools and in people's lives, but these people do not by any means represent every christian.\n\n \n \n I agree fully, but it does seem to be the more conservative christians that may the orginal complaint. I haven't really heard more liberal christians complain that people critize their beliefs. It is generally the ones who critize others for their beliefs. Just my opinion, but the critizing usually starts when conservatives start \"thumping\" their bible at people, when people start to reply by saying the bible makes no sense. Suddenly you have the first post of this thread. It seems like a circle thing.",

   "Look at how quick everyone ripped my post apart. I knew that would happen, but I really just posted it to prove a point. So many of you 'logical scientist' wonder why the 'myth believers' don't automatically jump on your side or are even willing to hear your viewpoint, which I will admit there are many on my side that would do the same. We (meaning both sides) lash out so quickly and abrubtly that we fail to communicate our thoughts and actually get somewhere in our discussions. I think if people actually responded more often with a cool head and clear thought we would be able to make process. In the end we are both striving towards the same goal, and that is answering the question of God's existence. That's why I often read many posts in the morning and try to respond at night, I'll admit that I am just as guilty at responding more out of emotion rather than thought. So I just wanted prove a point more or less....and I've heard those God scenarios before and the answers to them, but I honestly can't remember at all. Anyways, it was interesting to hear your thoughts though. \n \n As for discrediting Christ, I think there was a guy who tried to do that....um.....can't remember his name...he wrote a book on it though called The Case for Christ. So I think you should check that out if you want to see how he did at disproving the whole concept of Christianity. If I recall he didn't do to well.\n\n \n I've read it. Often his conclusions are not the only one's reachable. The whole thing is represented as rigorous \"detective\" work but the premise of him being skeptical at first but later convinced by the evidence is disingenuous.

The Devil's just a lackey). If God is not omniscient, and the eternal sufferings of hell exist through the Lord's LACK of knowledge and competence, He should be deeply ashamed of himself for the horrors his ignorant negligence has caused, and continues to cause.\n \n These sorts of arguments are usually answered by an uncomfortable pause, then, \n \n \"We cannot hope to understand the ways of God...\" \n \n (Humility.

It is the whole \"jesus died on the cross for your sins, and as such you should worship him\" thing that really gets to people. That and the people who continuously try to cram that little nugget down our throats. Can't you just believe what you want to believe and leave everyone else alone? That is what I try to do, and it seems to work well for me.\n\n I think there was an article in a magazine (was it Playboy? :)) that said that one of the major problems facing the world today is religious tolerance. Not that people should be more tolerant, but the article said that it's people tolerance of whatever any religion says that's the problem. The article claimed that many current problems, like terrorism, are a direct result of people hearing some sort of zealot speak all sorts of abominable things, shrugging, and saying \"well, that's his religious choice, who am I to interfere?\" It suggested that if more people challenged religious ideas, then maybe (just maybe , but I think it would serve to stir up even more division) the world would be a better place.\n \n Personally, I think we have to have some sort of religious tolerance anyway.\n Keep up the discussion, of course. Don't let superstition get the better of anyone, if you can help it. But, if someone is convinced of something so strongly to where they say they have faith , then there isn't likely anything you can do about it. I think the more generally ignorant a person is the easier it is to convert them to a religion. Once converted, it is almost impossible to remove that person from the religion, despite any type of \"re-education\".",

They are trying to keep themselves from being pushed into a christian society. They want the equal playing field. When a christian argues to make some part of society (the laws of such actually) more christian or gets ****** when christianity is excluded, they want the unequal playing field. \n \n That's why I ask who pushing whom?",

It's not part of the Gospel to understand fully, but to have faith. Living according to the Gospel will give you more of an understanding as you reach different levels of spiritual growth, but the fullness of God will come later when we have beaten the flesh (or crucified the flesh as Paul states) and have given ourselves over to that perfect will of God. Not to go into the preaching aspect here, but it is far more important to strive for perfection of spirit than for worldly understanding. In this way we are able to understand God's will for us.\n \n Being created in His imagine does not give us all the ability we need to become perfect, as He is perfect, but it does give us an idea of who He is by allowing us, spiritually, to break the bonds of the flesh - or the natural man - and allow the spirit-man inside to take over.

Over the years we've portrayed evil as heroes or heroines to the point that we become synthesized to its basic intentions. If the present blindness continues we'll get to the point that we call evil good and good evil. Animals are not evil, nor do they know evil. Evil can affect them, however, but only through mankind.\n \nevil does not exist, except in our minds. if i dont see fred's boss firing him as evil, but you do, which one of us is diseased? how do you even detect evil?\n\n When, as a child, you saw evil it scared you, right? Even now, when evil influences your loved ones it's terrible, is it not? Evil is real and is a living entity that preys on mankind. Not unlike cancer, its symptoms may vary, but the end result is the same. Some people are able to detect it quicker than others because they are aware of its presence, alert to its devices. Even those that are prepared to deal with it become horrible victims. Why? Because of its total and unhindered acceptance through ignorance.\n \n Evil is not like a cloud that covers the sun so that we know without even looking that it's there. Evil comes to us through our desires, through the unlocked and, sometimes, open doors. It comes into our lives and changes nothing at first. Maybe a word said in haste, or an act of carelessness. It creeps in slowly, but surely, until it's satisfied that your defenses are weak. Then, before you know it, you're not only hating what you once loved, but you're hating yourself. Then, as its perfect work, it causes you to hate God, which leads to death. Evil's sole purpose is to keep us away from God. After its done with you it drops you and leaves you where you fell.\n \nwhat i meant that too many times people see every harmful thing that comes their way as evil, almost as if their expectation of a \"good life\" implies the total absence of pain. this is ridiculous. there can NEVER be a total absence of pain. pain is our most primal and essential sense. pain is what keeps a species of organisms alive. take away the ability to feel pain from any organism and they will die quickly.\n\n I agree. I was referring to evil as something that feels bad or hurts. That's not necessarily the case with evil. The Bible says that evil can shine like a diamond (paraphrasing 2 Corinthians 11:14); it can fool us, deceive even the most faithful. Being torn like the little girl in the movie The Exorcist isn't practical. At the onset evil must lure us away, gently in order for its overall plan to come together. Making us feel at ease in wrongdoing is where it shines.\n \nyes, religion, and its influence on society, is the cause of the problem. religion promises the attainment of a pain-free existence, a world of constant joy and bliss. society buys the idea and perpetuates it, now everyone thinks that the ultimate goal in life is to be pain free. therefore, things that cause us pain, we label them \"evil\" and shun them\n\n Some religions even go further. They open the Holy Bible and then say, \"God said...\", without even reading the scriptures - except for what suits their agenda.\n \n \nin reality, the goal IS to live pain-free. but labelling painful agents as evil really doesnt make the existence of the agent go away\n\n It depends on the agent.

   "This thread is frustrating to read - it's just like many others in that you have agnostics and aethists who reason from the stand point that God doesn't exist, or is incapable, or indifferent, or that we can't know if He exists - they have no evidence He exists so why bring him up? The theists of which neither two seem to agree in the fine detail of their beliefs reason on the assumption that God does exist.\n \n These two groups can't possibly have a discussion that doesn't end in -\n \n \"God exists!\"\n \"Where's your evidence?\"\n \n This discussion like many just seems very futile...\n \n 'Evil' what a concept... I can't even define the term to my satisfaction for goodness sake.\n\n \n I am a little behind in this discussion (I haven't been visiting the board much). However, your comments here are actually very correct. I would submit, though, that when one discusses the topic \"Misconceptions about God\" one MUST ASSUME God does exist as He is the one there are \"misconceptions\" about. Unless it is just another attempt to discuss the question \"does God exist\" by saying that His existence is the biggest misconception about Him.\n \n If we really want to discuss misconceptions about God, then let us, for the sake of argument (and this is where that phrase truly fits), assume He exists and discuss His nature.\n \n To really do that we must also agree on some authority for the nature of God. A non religious example would be that we might consider a paleontologist to be an authority on ancient cultures. Or we might agree that a certain collection of writings are considered an \"authority\". \n \n I propose a new thread that has a purpose of actually coming to an agreement on what authority can be used in determining the nature of God. Once a formal agreement is reached then a new thread is started to discuss the nature based on the agreed upon authority.\n \n Not likely to happen, I know, but what the hey! :) emoticon_idea",

   "too many people there is no distinction\n\n There's no doubt that many religions have used the Bible to push their agenda. You'll get no argue from me there.\n \nbig orn, evil is in the eye of the beholder. nothing is universally or objectively evil. evil is generally defined by what the \"masses\" consider evil\n\n This is what the powers of darkness want you to believe. It's worked so well for so long that now evil has nothing at all to do but to sit back and watch his lies grow fruit. There is a universal evil whether it can be detected scientifically or medically...not even love can be measured to satisfy logic.\n Apparently, somewhere down the line, we have limited ourselves while trying to broaden our horizons. Unknowingly those who deny the existence of a Higher Power have succumbed to a religion that has bound and gagged them at least as much as the typical stringent organized religions.\n \nwe are taught as children what evil is, or what we should identify as evil. yes, every species is designed to avoid agents that cause them harm. thats how they survive. but no \"evil\" label is applied. if an earthworm gets caught out on the surface when the sun comes up, the sun will kill it, or a bird will eat it. but to the earthworm the sun is not evil, and neither is the bird. they are just natural perils it should avoid in order to continue surviving. as humans, we need to avoid viruses, serial killers and drug abuse for the same reasons. but we call these things \"evil\", and give them spiritual connotations (\"these things are of the devil\" etc)\n\n To the extent that people call things evil that are not, I agree, but I believe they do so as a result of religious ignorance...period. I can give you several passages of scripture where a person, when presented with erroneous teachings, can misconstrue it's meaning and presume evil exists in his neighbor or his neighbor's belongings (pets, truck, house, etc.). But, they are either too lazy to actually read and understand the full meaning of the scripture or they are \"set in their ways\" due to lack of faith.\n \nyes if resist evil, it will flee. the eradication of evil is as simple as not acknowledging its existence (something you advised against earlier). ANY and EVERY situation, person, thing and event can be seen as either good or evil based on the perspective of the viewer. if i am an optimist, and i see the opportunity in every case you see as a failure, i am no more diseased than you. in fact, the \"realist\" that cannot see beyond the fact that \"good\" and \"evil\" is only in he mind is usually the the one susceptible to depression and low self image, and will more likely contract real diseases\n\n If you ignore evil it will flourish. Resisting evil and ignoring it are two different things. For ages mankind has tried to pinpoint evil; they have even made \"potions\" to combat it. That's the problem we have today - looking to some concoction that will rid a person of evil. First we have to identify it for what it is. Every great mind that has accomplished great acts has had to get to the core of a problem, then solve it. You can't throw the contents of a drug store at something that's immune to drugs. You can't fight evil with emotions or with stepped sessions at the psychiatrist. Negative mood swings and the influence of evil are not mutually exclusive, but according to some religions they are. That's the whole problem: A person unwilling to acknowledge evil for what it really is stands no chance to understand it, much less combat it.\n And when we truly realize what evil is, we have the most impressive, formidable weapon - the Holy Spirit.\n \n As far as being more susceptible to disease? Treating the symptoms of evil will get you just far enough to think that evil exists only in the mind. \n \nhere is the idea. there are things that bring about death, destruction, or some form of harm. there are things that bring about life or continued existence. this is as true for humans as it is for every other living thing that exists. no organism wants to die, it would rather live. living organisms are engineered so that they would live long enough to reproduce and continue their existence. thats as basic a characteristic of life as it gets\n \n humans, being the beings that look for reasons, also want to live, and avoid perils that cause death and harm. we would ask \"why is there harm? why shouldnt we just keep living?\" we would reason that there is something inherently wrong with the agents that cause harm, something unnatural. this something must be fueled by a supernatural force, since it is not natural for there to be harm. \"but if this supernatural force that causes harm is so great, what are we to do?\" oh dont worry, there must also be a supernatural force that helps us avoid harm. \n\n You would think that after all these years, if the above were true, that we would have found some chemical that would eliminate evil, thus proving that evil and good are only figments of our imagination. Not all things that are harmful are evil, but, nonetheless, not all things evil cause harm in a physical sense. I have no way to prove this, but logic should conclude that some percentage of the \"bad guys\" lived a happier life than some of the \"good guys\". Evil has the ability to do well in this world because of disbelief, ignorance, and pride. It also has the capability of destroying lives in a single blow due to fear and doubt. It can actually continue unchanged and in full view, carrying on as usual in an uninformed society, and remain \"blameless\" for the ills thereof.\n \nthe fact is, a serial killer is no more \"unnaturally evil\" than a baby chick that pushes his siblings out the nest. yes we must avoid or eliminate these agents whenever possible so that te species can survive. but introducing the idea of evil as \"an entity of itself\"? i dont think so\n\n Then, when evil flourishes, good men should do nothing? It's all natural, anyway...",
