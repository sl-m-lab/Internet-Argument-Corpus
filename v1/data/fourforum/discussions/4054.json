Many of us have spoken of their parents reactions, both positive and negatively. What concerns me is the reaction of the anti-gay posters here if they found out their own child is gay.\n\n \n - First, I think the term \"anti-gay\" is a misnomer with most people here. I am not in favor of redefining marriage in this country, yet I do think we should find ways to meet their needs in terms of benefits. I also an against any form of discrimination in the workplace and elsewhere. I don't think that makes me anti-gay. Such a term is very wide-open to mean a lot of different things to different people. I could just as easily call you \"anti-society\" since you want society to change it's views. But I won't. ;) \n \n - Second, I think you would be surprised at a lot of people that you consider to be anti-gay, at how they would deal with the situation you presented. I think we hear news reports about some parents' rejection of their kids over things like this and assume sometimes that it applies to most people who don't buy the gay lobby's views hook, line, and sinker. One only needs to look at our Vice President to see that a parent often doesn't reject his or her child even if he doesn't agree with everything his child does. \n \n - We also need to understand that just because a parent doesn't automatically approve of everything their child does, it doesn't mean the parent doesn't love the child, or rejects them. Parents OFTEN have concerns about many things their kids do. It's part of raising a child.\n \n And that takes me to my response, which would be that it would not effect my view of, or my love for my child in any way whatsoever. Would I like the fact my child would go out and have gay sex with someone? Of course not. I wouldn't like it if they came home with body piercings everywhere either. But I'd love them no less, and be no less accepting.\n \n Why is something like that hard for you to believe? I can't imagine anyone doing anything different, and I suspect that most, by far, wouldn't. Unless they just aren't very good parents to begin with.",

If they began to take the \"I'm different, therefore I need special treatment\" attitude, I would have to go that extra mile, explain to them the ramifications of \"joining the crowd\" and then hang on long enough to see that they either accepted or rejected the truth. If they rejected it, then my job would basically be over.

   "Justine, I see you and others putting a lot of effort into trying to separate homosexuality from sex.\n \n Here are some reasons why the gig is up . . .\n \n - much of the gay rights movement grew out of the seedy, backdoor sex and porn world. It didn't come from normal everyday homes and families; the gay rights movement came out of the gay sex bars and bathhouses. It was a community all right, a community of twisted sexual gratification. Normal, everyday gay households are mostly a new phenomenon, as your movement has tried to move homosexuality more into the mainstream\n\n \n Twisted? Ever heard of Hedonism II? Guess what? They are predominantly a STRAIGHT SEX CLUB! They swap married partners, engage in beastiality, BDSM, Water sports (which is really disgusting), Fecal play (yeah, even with opposite sex partners...eeewww, eeewww, EEEWW) and so on and so forth. \n Gays do NOT have a corner on disgusting sexual practices. \n \n Gay Marriage is mostly a new phenominon as well. So? What's you're point? \n \n \n \n- Ever been to a gay pride parade? It's got so many sexual elements to it, it's comical to even portray it as a typical parade. \n\n \n Ever been to a Mardi Gras parade? It's got so many sexual elements it's blasphemous to associate it with a religious holiday! \n \n \n- Your men have the highest rates of HIV infection of ANY group--that's right the absolute highest, by far. Do you think gay men have been going around giving each other blood transfusions? No. It's because the homosexual movement embodies promiscuity, pure and simple.\n\n \n My men? Honey, what part of LESBIAN don't you understand? \n I DON'T DO MEN!!!! \n :xbanghead \n Besides, you're dead wrong in your statement. You conveniently forget the MILLIONS INFECTED in AFRICA...ALMOST 85% of them are STRAIGHT!!! \n Doh! \n \n \n \nWhy don't you just come clean and at least be honest about these things.\n\n \n Why don't you? \n \n \n Everyone else knows [hetero]sexuality is about sex, and so is your pride movement. You can try to put a nice face on it if you want, but most people know the situation.\n\n \n Get off your high horse darlin', you ain't so muckin fuch yourself! \n \n \n \nNow again, I think what Jamaan is saying is that he would certainly love his child just as much if his child came home one day saying he was gay. That doesn't mean Jamaan has to approve of everything his son does. Love does not always mean approval across the board. Again, there are lots of things I might not want my child to do that would make me very sad. If he called from jail saying he'd been arrested for drunk driving, I'd be very sad and would not approve, but I'd love him no less. That's just one example among many.\n\n \n Ah, but you see that's where your GIG is up. Driving Drunk is a CHOICE! \n Being Gay is NOT!  \n No matter how you try to grind it into the mud.",

If you disapprove of their actions, keep it to yourself and treat them like a straight child.\n \n My mother falls under the category of \"accept but disapprove of actions\" and it is literally pushing me off the deep end. I find myself every day wishing that I had never said anything. If anyone with a gay child is reading this, please do not become like my mother. Just disapproval is not too harmful, but I have been kicked out of the house for giving a hug to a friend who was crying, which lasted for all of two seconds and was only meant to give condolence. I spent the night on the deck in 38 degree weather. That is not only harmful, but unfair to me.\n \n Not to mention the hate talk I get from my family every time I do ANYTHING remotely resembling communicating with another female. Do you know how it feels to have your own parents, your own brother, tell you over and over that you're worthless and should never have been born? It kills me every time they do this. You'd think I'd get over it after a while. But I can't. I love my family, and I find myself hoping they'll forgive me every time something comes up.\n \n I can understand my parents viewpoints. I can understand both sides of the arguement. But I do NOT understand why someone would hurt their own child because of an aspect of their personality that does no one any harm.\n \n I may be a teen, young and inexperienced, but even I can understand what is happening with bigoted parents. And the sad thing is, it often remains a family secret. No one outside the circle knows. That's the worst part. There is no help.\n \n That irritates me. Anyone else here of the same opinion?\n\n \n I have a little bit of an understanding, empethetically. My partner came out to her mother several years before I ever met her. Her mother told her to never tell anyone else in her family about her being gay. This hurt my partner, but she has respected her mother's request. My partner knows that her family would reject her, or at least that's the impression her mother gave her, if she did tell the rest of the family. I know everytime my partner goes to visit her family, her father, brother and cousins always ask why she hasn't found a guy and settled down. Every time she goes for a visit her father tries to manipulate her into moving out where they are. He attempts to bribe her with money, favors and presents. All the while my partner has to refuse so she can return home to OUR family. And each time she leaves I get a little worried that maybe this time she'll either give in to her father's requests to stay out there or she'll just snap, tell her father and have her mother and possibly the rest of her family, never speak to her again. \n \n Personally, I wondered if my family would react poorly to my coming out and was prepaired to loose them if it meant that I was being honest with the ones I loved. But my partner isn't prepaired. She can't stand the idea of her family rejecting her. But I know it pains her to not be able to be honest with them. To know that everytime she sees them she's in ecesence lieing to them. \n \n My partner and I used to argue about it at first. But I've given up arguing. I know that she won't tell them without her mother's approval to do so. I also know her mother will never give that approval. So, insted I just bite my tongue and let it go. \n I know that if she did accept her father's offer to go out where they are, I would not be welcome to come with her. I'm just her \"roommate\" in their eyes. I have no business being there. I have no family or friends of my own out where they live, so I would be isolated. I'm not willing to do that because I've done it once before and it nearly destroyed me. My partner knows my feelings and I know hers. I know it tears her up inside. \n \n Even now, her parents are in town visiting her here, for her birthday. They haven't been to out place yet. I'm hoping they don't. But if they do, before they arrived, my partner told me we had to \"De-XXXX\" the place. Meaning, hide all gay related books, artwork and gay-themed movies. This is truly an annoying task as these items are just part of our home. This also means any plans I may have wanted to make had to be canceled. We have another friend who has a birthday close to my partner's. We had wanted to make plans to combine their birthday celebrations, but since my partner's parents are in town, we've have to shelve these. \n \n In short, my partner not being able to come out to her family has disrupted out lives several times and in several ways.",

   "I have empathy for both of you. My family position is much the same, with only my immediate family knowing. The rest of my family acts much the same as your partner's, with the questions and such. Only, I'm a 15 year old, so I shouldn't be settling down yet. And I understand how this affects you also.\n \n My partner and I have been together for 3 years, and her family knows. They have stated clearly that if she has a partner, she is out. This presents quite a few problems...not the least of which is that she loves her family and is not willing to ditch them. I wouldn't want her too, but that means she wouldn't leave them yet. Especially to go to a shelter.\n \n It's difficult for us to find any time to spend together, and since only she can drive without an adult, that limits options a bit. That, and I can't go in the car with her and have my parents know, or the same fate awaits me as does her. We're both loyal to each other and will most likely continue this way, myself having no idea what the future will bring though neither of us wants to break up. Our families can't comprehend this. So for the sake of each other, we just don't say anything. But it's hard every time you have to lie to your family about things. Or, like I do, I just don't tell the whole truth. But you still feel guilty.\n \n My best wishes for both of you.",

   "Thank you Kismet, but actually, I'm the lucky one. My immediate family actually supports me. My brother and his wife actually adore my partner and we're all very close. My parents live in Arkansas, which generally is a concervative area, except where they are. They live in this little hamlet where there are quite a few gays and lesbians. Mom jokingly calls it \"Dykeville, USA.\" Their area not only has a \"Pride\" day, but also celebrates a \"diversity\" weekend. Fairly impressive for such a secluded area. \n \n I have been very lucky. I guess that's what gives my partner the strength to continue to turn down her father's manipulations. She knows she can turn to my family if ever she is in need. She knows that my brother will defend her completely.",

   "That is lucky. But I have a problem I'd like to present to you that is currently hanging me out on a limb. \n \n I have a friend named Dan, who lives down the street from me. Our parents absolutely hate each other and he and I have been banned from seeing each other since the age of 5. Our parents act the same about the whole homosexuality issue, but his parents have now gone a step farther. Not only is he not allowed to see anyone outside of school, he has no computer to have any contact with the outside world, no cell phone, and is not allowed to use the home phone. His parents don't abuse him physically, not since his brother nearly killed him when he was 8, but they've completely devastated everything he thinks about himself.\n \n Dan and I still see each other, usually on the walk from the bus stop. I'll go out and walk with him so that I can talk to him. He's in middle school, meaning there's no GSA or anything, and, as I went to the same middle school, it's.....rough. I used to be jumped once a week for being a les. He has it no better, but I did manage to impart some fighting skills to him that keep him from getting seriously injured. At this particular school, they don't care what you have as long as its not a gun or drugs. Not that those aren't there, but....you can bring a knife under 4 inches and no one really gives, as long as you don't advertise it.\n \n Lately though, since things are getting worse, he's been coming over at around midnight and sitting with me and talking, which is the best thing I can find to do for him. He just sits and cries. I've offered to call someone to get his family off his back, which is where most of the problem is, but he refuses, saying that he doesn't want them gone, he wants them to want him. I know the feeling, but in my opinion it's not worth the sacrifice he's making. I just don't know what to do other than convince him that he's not worthless and perverted. Not to mention we're eventually going to get caught if he keeps coming over and climbing through my window.\n \n Anyone have anything else I can do to help him? I know I should probably call someone, especially since I don't know what his family is doing, but I won't do that without his permission.

In the first case I would think some sort of counseling would help. An expert telling them that it isn't good for the child to be shut off like that might convince them. If they are doing it to punish him for some reason, then I don't know what he could do. But if he really has no one but you to talk to and he gets caught, I really don't think suicide would be out of the question. If you really think he is considering it, then you really do need to get help from a counselor or something because as bad as being shut out from society is, suicide is worse.",

   "Dan's parents are just punishing him for who he is. They're a more....intense form of my parents. I honestly don't know why our parents don't get along, they act so much the same, right down to saying the same things and having the same punishments. The only difference is that I bought myself a cell phone and plan, and my parents work until later, so I can get away with a lot of stuff. Like going on here, and having some contact with the outside world. I try to do what I can, but I WILL NOT betray him. Not even in this situation. He would commit suicide if I did. He's told me that I'm the only reason he's living, and I WILL NOT take that away from him.\n \n I am wondering though, he's 15, so he's only got a few years until he can and will move out. And only a year until he can drive to get away from it all. I've been thinking that possibly we could pretend to go out for a while, which his parents would be....overjoyed about. I don't think that they would mind me, as long as I kept from mentioning our parents. I do know that his parents wouldn't tell my parents anything, and its quite easy for me to hide things from my parents. Right now what Dan needs is some time away from his parents and to himself. And I wouldn't mind spending the time needed to pull off such an act with him. I also don't know what other consequences that would bring, either, whether they be good or bad. Someone help me?\n \n If I can get him some down time away from his brother and parents, he'll be much better, and he's not about to die soon. If anything, Dan is a man of his word, and he says he wouldn't do anything fatal unless I left him. Bad to hear, good is the fact that I'm not going anywhere soon. He's got a certain amount of time.\n \n Ooo, how much I'd LOVE to injure his parents, and especially his brother, but at least I'm mature enough to throttle down that feeling the second it appears. Personally, right now I'm afraid of myself doing something rash, though I have an extremely high amount of self control, which is vital at a time like this...doesn't stop me from staring at my knives though. Man, does life have to get any tougher? There, I let out the inner teen. Seriously though, I may be far more mature than any of the other kids my age, but I can't help but feel a 15 year old shouldn't have to be a parent to over 10 kids.....plus everything else that's been going on.

   "Who's taking care of me? I'll tell you that answer. I am. I take care of myself, my house, my little brother, and every chore that goes along with those. I take care of my friends and those who I am a parent too.\n \n I've been taking care of myself for a long time, Joe. I've been around and done a lot of things. I have knowledge most people wouldn't even think a 15 year old would possibly even think of knowing. I spent 3 years as a drug runner for a gang leader and the leader of a drug ring. I've met quite a few people who are in the Mafia. You may believe I have a twisted sense of right, but I will not turn a single one of the criminals I know in. Not only would that get me killed, or worse, it would move on to the friends I might have told. I just got out of that whole thing a month and a half ago. Do you know what that cost me? I had to face one of my biggest fears and confront a man that has murdered more than one person. I've only seen one body. Do you know how scary that is? I can never do another deal again, or I'll be shot. I'm marked as a traitor. For everyone to see. I have a blue tattoo that this man gave to me against my will. But I have kept countless people safe.\n \n Last Christmas I tried suicide. Someone found me, stopped most of the bleeding and told me it was up to me if I wanted to live. I chose yes. I walked into my house, in front of my parents, dripping blood from my jacket. Guess what? No comments. They didn't even notice. They didn't care. They care about my little brother. Not their worthless gay child that is a disgrace to them.\n \n I am not a normal teenager, as much as I wish I was. You may think otherwise, but I take care of myself. The only thing I can't do is drive. I have my own business because if I didn't, I wouldn't get to eat half the time. Maturity is not really an issue here, other than I don't have the age required to have the appropriate life lessons yet. But I'll get there eventually.\n \n As for the whole going out issue, I've thought about that side. And that's why I was unsure of what to do. I'll take what you said to heart. Thank you.",

   "Guess it's time for appologies. Just had a really bad day yesterday, and was a bit....angry to say the least. Quite frankly I was surprised I didn't hit anyone. Perhaps I need to find a way to let out my anger other than practicing with knives. ....yea. Just reading that sounds a little off to me. I think I'll work on that.\n \n I can definitely relate to the drugs though. It's a way to escape the world, but it seriously messes you up. I used to be able to pass all my classes without cracking a book, and I was already 2 years ahead of everyone else. Now I really have to work hard to remember things and keep up good grades. Amazing what hindsight does to you.\n \n Sure, I'd love to talk to you, and I'm sorry I went off on a rant yesterday. It's just that I get asked that all the time, and I get tired of people automatically assuming I'm just like the rest of the population my age. I know that you weren't, but......it came close. And I spent the whole day yesterday as the subject of 6 hours of hate talk, insults, punishments, and general dissing from school and my parents. On the plus side, I didn't get kicked out again. (Go me.)\n \n The other thing I'd like to speak about is suicide. You tried to kill yourself 13 times. I've tried 4, and one of my friends has tried 6. Sometimes it scares me how much I liked the feeling of dying. I tried the christmas of 2003, talk about a wonderful present, and it still haunts me. But for me, drugs and suicide are tied together. I really need to get a load off, so bear with me. I haven't told this to anyone out loud, but I really need to get it off my chest because I still feel bad about it.\n \n In 7th grade, I had a friend named Ginger. She went to my school and we were pretty good friends, not best friends though. She lived with a single dad in an apartment not far from the school and walked to school every day. One day she didn't come to school, and we all assumed she was sick. The next day, she came in looking like hell. We asked her what was wrong, and she wouldn't tell us. She just said that the day before had been a bad day. She asked me if I could get her some coke, and since I was in the business and on it, I said yea. I thought she was going to be fine, that she just needed to get away for a while. Man, that was the worst decision I ever made. She didn't come to school the next day. She OD'd on the drugs I'd given her and killed herself. It turns out she had come home two days before and her dad had hung himself. Even though I didn't know what she would do, I still feel horrible, like i was responsible for her death. I know I wasn't, and she would've found another way to do it, but......\n \n ok. Enough of that. Suicide sucks. It's pointless and hurts others. And I'm never doing it again. Ok, I feel better now.\n \n Yea, Joe, I'd like those resources. Compiling a catalog of sorts. And looking into them. Thanks.",

   "Well, to start. I looked at your profile and we share the same b-day. Just add a couples years, minus lots of hair, oh wait lets skip that part.\n \n \n There are some great gay youth chat groups out there. Planetout.com has one as well as a web forum. Gay.com has another but I find that one hard to navagate.\n \n A great site that is not specifically gay, but has great resources is www.youth.org \n \n \n Something to look for at school is a yellow sign on teachers doors that say \"Safe Zone\". It is a project many teachers and school employees participant in that tells students they are \"gay friendly\" Teachers may put the sign in the classroom or on the door. If you see it, you know it is safe.\n \n I hope this is a good start. I will page through some of the stuff here at the office to remind myself of the stuff I am looking for..\n \n Also, for Dan's sake. Make sure you are familiar with the signs of Suicide. I put up a link, you can sort of watch him and look for these signs. Don't be afraid to talk about those feelings.

   "Thanks for the chats. Yea, I knew about the safe zones, and none of the teachers at my school have them, but my little lunch group comes pretty close. We all eat under the stairwell, and probably half of the kids are gay, the other half are just outcasts, though most of them are in IB, which is a whole different type of kid anyway. IB kids tend to think differently. They tend to not be able to do simple math in their heads, but have no problem doing partial or whole decomposition of fractions with logs in their heads. How that one works don't ask me. Heh, math is NOT my best subject.\n \n I've been watching Dan for any of the signs, too. Trust me, I know them. I DID them, and I analyze everything. Haven't figured out why yet. Maybe it's just another me thing.\n \n The birthday thing is a weird coincidence though. Heh, so we both have Thanksgiving birthdays every 8 years.....I hate that. I mean, geez, everyone conveniently forgets it's my b-day when it falls on Thanksgiving. Then again, I kinda like that. I'd rather get nothing than what I would get on my birthday from my family if they did remember. Let's put it this way, last year's present from my parents was a 5 dollar bill. Made me feel real great. Ah, well, I've got friends, and they're the family you pick. \n \n As for hair.....hey, I wouldn't know. I like being a teenager. Got lots of energy, I CAN and do control the mood swing hormone ****, and I'm in school. I like school. I'm still not sure what I'm going to do when I get out of high school. I can go to college, then to Marines, or Marines, 4 year active duty, then get a heck of a lot of money in scholarships. But I'll have forgotten a lot of stuff. Tch. I got time. As it is, I'm a mere freshie in school, so hey, live life to the fullest, eh? \n \n Thanks for your help, Joe. It truly is appreciated.",

   "SEVENTH GRADE AND ON COKE!?!?!\n \n Pardon me, but that to me is a BIG PROBLEM!!!\n \n Ok, maybe I'm \"un-cool\" or whatever, but when I was a kid I would never have thought of doing drugs while I was still in school, and especially not in middle school! \n \n That just seems like a huge cry for help if kids are doing drugs at that age. Yes, I had a friend who was into drugs at what I thought was an early age, and I did everything I could to get her off them. I flushed them, I hid them, I even re-sold them just to keep them away from her. One drug at a time, I did suceed, but it took years and was a huge strain on our friendship. \n \n I guess I never did drugs while still in school because I had a big brother who once had a talk with me. I knew he had experimented, but he was also really really smart (actually he's of the genius level) and I respected his insight. He made me promice I would never do anything until I had graduated high school. I did and I kept that promice. I saw later on what drugs did to a dear friend of ours. \n A once extremely tallented musician got a bad batch of something and just a year after high school he couldn't even pick up any instrument. He couldn't remember basic chords, notes and couldn't read music anymore. The drugs messed him up so badly that they changed his personality dramatically. A once serious and intence personality turned into a complete ditz. \n \n I really don't want to sound like an Anti-drug commercial, but please, if you're in school and doing drugs...get help! I know the temptation to escape reality is extreme, especially for gay/lesbian kids...remember I am one too. I hated who I was and wished I could just disappear, but I never resorted to drugs. I knew that if there would ever be a chance for me somewhere down the line doing drugs at that age would have made it impossible to attain. \n \n See, the problem is that school age kids brains are still developing emotionally until about age 18 -22. Doing drugs at that age or before severly retards that portion of brain development. \n \n {And we wonder why there's such a problem with the emotional development of adults...hmmm...come on, it's so obvious. }",

And it doesn't matter how many you catch, there will always be more. \n \n You speak the truth Justine, and you don't really sound like an anti drug commercial.

And the cycle goes on. Do you know what? Stopping was the most difficult thing I ever did. I stopped after Ginger died. Do you know what I was on? Coke, heroin, pot, acid, speed, LSD. All of it. I went from being a genius to being a who has to struggle to keep focused and understand concepts I learned in 6th grade. The only thing allowing me to pass my classes right now is the futile thought that if I can make it through IB, in the highest rated IB school in North America, maybe my parents will admit to me that I won't end up being worthless.

Why do kids at that age feel the need for such an escape or even search for that kind of thrill? \n Because they are screaming for attention. For guidence. For interaction and reassurence from their parents and other adults. When kids don't get that they turn to their peer group for acceptence. Doing drugs makes the kid feel a lot of things that are better than the loneliness and emptiness in their lives. They feel cool, the feel as if they don't have to deal with the stresses of being their age, the feel free from school and teachers and their parents who are already ignoring them anyway.\n \n \n Then you get addicted. Then you become desperate for more. And the cycle goes on.\n\n \n Well that's true for any addiction.\n Smoking is just as addictive as heroin.\n \n \n Do you know what?

He's sixteen, he's not sexually active, doesn't do drugs and has good friends. Yeah, he's probably a freak in that...but he's aware of what drugs will do. He's met this ex-musician once. He has heard from both my brother and myself of what drugs did to this guy. \n \n I'm not saying I'm any kind of angel. I did drugs. I'll admit it. But I waited until I had graduated from high school before I even tried pot!\n No, I'm not proud of it, but I'm also honest about it. I've told my son about it, so has my brother. We're terribly honest with our kids. But I feel that because we're honest and we do actually take an active interest in our kids lives that we do have such decent kids. \n I'm not rich, I don't have tons of money to throw at my kid. I do however get involved. I learn who his friends are, know their parents and we're all involved in our kids lives. We trade off driving them around (ok, so my son will probably be the one to drive his friends around soon...as he just turned sixteen and got his permit!!! OH GODS!!! NO!!!), we have diners together, we help our kids plan outings and events and allow them to \"just hang out\" together. We trust them, and respect them as individuals. We also know they are just kids still and are aware that there are going to be temptations and stumbling blocks along the way. \n None of us are hugely religious people either.

   "You're completely correct that going to a bad school is a weak excuse. It never started me on drugs. No, I did them myself. The amount of self hate I have for making that choice is phenomenal.

I can't do much more other than trying to keep others from the same fate.\n \n Most of the kids I know do drugs because they're bored with everyday life. Things become repetitive, become boring, and, hey, a way out of the boredom. A bad way. One that will make them \"cool.\" Tch. It's the usual, I-have-to-find-somewhere-where-I-can-be-cool syndrome.\n \n Never tried a cigarette. Not planning to. The addiction thing, well, I'm definitely willing to believe it's as bad as heroin.\n \n No, I WAS NOT a dealer. I was a runner. There is a major difference. I gave some of MY stuff to a friend. Bad choice. Dealers get paid. I gave it freely. Which is what is killing me. I will never be able to correct that decision. I will never be able to make it better.

Instead of taking 6 classes a semester, we end up with eight, plus a study hall that we can choose to make an elective.\n \n The point I was making about school and the real world being different is that there are things you can get away with in school that you can't in the real world, and vice versa.

I have a fetish for skull and bones (anything De La Morte related) as well as my \"Devil Ducks.\" I blame my partner for all of it!!! LOL \n \n I love animals...except birds. I don't mean that I don't like birds...I just think it's a bit of an oxymoron to have a bird as a pet/caged. It defeats the purpose of being a bird. But that's just my opinion. \n \n The mice, lizards, snakes..etc...I'm cool with. Actually at the moment, I'm quitting smoking so I can get a Chinchilla. We already have three cats. We used to have seven fish, one being a lost trout (don't ask), a crawfish and a rat. \n The rat, as rats do, got sick and we had to put it down. The fish were all eaten by the trout and the crawfish lived as long as crawfish do...three years. \n The cats are our \"other children\" at the moment, until we get the Chinchilla. \n \n Our friends always comment that our home is \"interesting.\" Sometimes I wonder if they just mean \"strange\", but they keep comming over so I guess it can't be that off-putting!! LOL \n \n emoticon_xclown\n \n I also wouldn't call my son a \"typical\" kid either. I mean the only books he REALLY enjoys are horror...but not Anne Rice (shrugs). He plays WAY TOO MANY instruments...(it's never quite around here) and even though he's been in several theatre productions as well as a performer for our local Renaissance Faire...he refuses to audition for school plays. Don't ask...I think he's just being a snob. \n He also has a secret passion for musical theatre...but trust me...he's straight.",

   "See, you do sound great. The skull and bone thing, we share that, and I love drawing, painting, theater, writing, all of that. Your son and I are a lot alike too. Horror books are great, but Anne Rice.....she makes things a little too.....long and boring sort of. Kinda like Tolkein. A lot of people like him, but there are quite a few that think he goes on for too long. I am definitely one of those people. My favorite horror book is Hannibal though. That book is just too cool. That, and Hannibal and I think a lot the same, except that I don't eat people, nor do I want too.\n \n Military....I happen to agree that the military is not ready for women. I wanted to do military, but I would never go army or navy. Air force....no. Marines are a bit more tolerant. Sort of.\n \n Chinchila! I love those things......my dad had one when I was really little. And I had a crawfish once.....until it got eaten by the fish I had (goramis, don't get them. They eat anything and everything, including crabs, larger fish, fighting fish, we're talking everything)....I found both of my birds though. Both are cockateils, so I can't let them go, but one was starving and from a breeding farm, and the other was bitten by a cat and can't fly. So now they live with me. I love'm. One's a male, one's female, the male won't ever shut up, which, granted, does get really annoying. :) \n \n Ya, everyone that steps into my room either says its interesting, or screams and runs out due to the thirty or so free-roaming lizards and frogs.....heh heh heh. It's hilarious. Most people are like, ok, there's a billion little animals, a knife collection, and beanie babies, on the same shelf. What is wrong with this picture? Hahahahaha. I find it extremely amusing.\n \n Still, it would be fun to be ur kid. Your son is lucky to have such a great parent. And if your partner has the same attitude, he has two great parents. Envy.

Envy.... :)\n\n \n \n Thank you, really. But I'm still a parent...and with that comes the disapline and expectations. I expect good grades, respect towards his elders as well as anyone else, and timeliness. But since he's anal about timeliness too, it works out well. I have no patience for lies, excuses or plain laziness. My son has regular chores which must be done after homework but before anything else. This summer he'll be working at two jobs, one because it's actually a family favor (My sister-in-law's sister is going to be gone all summer and my son has been asked to care for her lawn...but he will be paid) as well as working at a local grocery store to earn money for a car. I am not one of those parents who just buys a car for my kid. He has to earn it himself, just as my brother and I were. \n Of course this might be a bit of a scheduling nightmare as he still wants to perform at Faire this summer too, which means every weekend throughout the summer and a couple even into the next school year. \n So we'll see about that...\n \n My Skull and bones thing came about because of performing at the Renaissance Faire. We perform a recreation of the \"Dans Mecabre'\" (Which we call the Dead Parade)Recognizing those who died from the plague. All characters must dress completely in black from head to toe...not one inch of skin can show. The only pieces of costuming that are allowed to not be black are if they are bones or shell or wood. This gives an erie air about the performers. The performers identies are secret. No performer or merchant is allowed to recognize our existance or look upon us as we pass through town. \n \n The parade is not silent though. We have noises which follow as we walk, run and dance. Shells rattling, drums pounding, bells ringing...we do make our presence known, but only to the patrons. Of course we get some really strange comments as we pass through too. \n There are two groups of performers not associated with the Dead who do recognize us, but indirectly. While we parade one troup sings a song which mocks the parade and another group, usually made up of patron children is doing the \"ring-around-the-rosie\" with all verses being taught, while we pass through their circle, silently. (That's one of the few times we do go silent.)\n \n \n But enough of that...just an explaination of how my interest came to be.",

   "As a parent, discipline is to be expected. For instance, if a kid starts turning in work late or not getting chores done, it's good for them to be punished. Teaches right and wrong.\n \n Personally, I have to take care of the house, meaning everything that is not my parents room or my brothers. I also have to cook dinner every night and get my brother to and from his baseball practices. I usually cheat with the last one by putting him on my dirtbike and going through the woods, but hey, it works and it's legal. I have my own business that I run, doing fundraisers for schools, churches, organizations, whatever. All the pets are my resposibility, and I have to keep above a 3.0 otherwise I'm out of IB. Not that I wouldn't anyway, I love school. Then you've got all my extracurricular stuff, which consists 99% of motocross races. I get prize money and put it towards college, my bike, and the down payment for a car. Not that I'm sure I'm going to have a car, as I've already bought myself a Honda Hawk that I can legally drive in a mere 2 years. So that brings with it the time necessary to fix my bike, and get myself to races, which can be tough, as my parents won't give me rides. Usually I bum a ride off of my friend who's been a buddy since we started with dirt bikes, back when we were 3.\n \n The responsibility concept is definitely not lost on me. Geez, it's like I have 10 adopted kids at the moment, only they feed themselves. Thank god.\n \n For someone who wasn't planning to have kids at all, it seems like I've gained myself a few. Ah, well, what can a body do?\n \n I love the Faire, even though I haven't been many times. That's always been something I've wanted to do, but I've never had the time or the resources, so I content myself with going whenever I can. Another fun thing that I do once a year: Brooksville Raid, civil war reenactment. Funfun. Like the Faire, only civil war style! Heh, that's probably the most fun thing out of the year for me. I get to pretend to be a soldier, dress up like one, tote around a musket, and perform knife tricks. I love it!\n \n You know, I feel a lot better now. Talking (well, technically typing) definitely helps get a load off. Probably the fact that I'm out of school today has something to do with it too. Only now I've got people coming over and demanding where I was today.....Apparently one of the kids in my class was harassing the lunch gang. Ah, well, I'll find a way to fix that tomorrow when I return to the land of the zombies. Amusing, since the guy is a football player and is afraid of me. He was at the Raid one year and saw me perform. Man, there ARE some good side effects to doing that..... :)",
