   "The argument that God cannot exist due to the amount and degree of evil present in the world is often proposed by atheists and agnostics. There is an acknowledgement in that statement that evil does, in fact, exist. \n \n But can evil exist in the context of a purely materialistic atheism/agnosticism?\n \n Does the statement above refute theism or atheism?\n\n First of all, whether exists \"evil\" is merely a matter of the definition of the word\n \n 1. Morally bad or wrong; wicked\n 2. Causing ruin, injury, or pain; harmful\n \n the first definition only applies if you believe in some set of absolute principles. the second definition is easier for atheists to relate to.\n \n I think that in either case, we all agree that evil does currently exist\n \n would it exist without the existence of God? OK, first there are lots of people that believe God does not exist, yet they agree that evil exists\n \n I personally think that evil would exist simply based on the existence of free will. if man has an imagination that can invent options, and a free will that can allow him to choose those options and act on those options, then the choice to harm another will alway exist, and therefore the action of harming others will alway exist.\n \n finally, its very interesting that the argument \"there is evil, therefore God doesnt exist\" comes head to head with the subject of this thread\n \n God is benevolent and loving\n but evil exists\n therefore God doesnt exist\n therefore absolute morals dont exist\n therefore \"right\" or \"wrong\" doesnt exist\n therefore evil doesnt exist\n \n the presence of evil in the world seems to substantiate the existence of God rather that disprove it. Because if it is somehow found that God truly doesnt exist, then who will we hold accountable for all the evil in the world? would it be then apparent that evil is nothing but the consequences of man's choices? would this congizance cause people to be more conscious of the impact of their actions and repent of their wrong?",

   "Even in theology there is no \"good\" or \"evil\". It is a political term. Good means you are aligned with God and Evil of the Devil. Hence God=G(o)od Devil= D(e) evil (of evil). So there is no absolute.\n \n Take murder. Murdering a adulterer was Good because God told the israelites to do it. People that didn't were evil. Now God decides to changed the rules now murdering an adulterer is evil.\n \n The same goes for society. All nations give the government the right as a sorverign state to murder who it chooses. There are generally laws that make it politically unfriendly in conservative nations but it is still murder.\n \n In theism God defines good and evil. In atheism self defines good and evil.

   "It might seem at this point that the problem of evil has been solved and that, as it turns out, evil is not really a problem after all. Once we realize that there is so little agreement on what is evil or what to do about it, and that our merely human judgment is either stunted or partial, then we must confess that our complaints are without merit. Only God could know the big picture, and into that picture backaches and headaches, cancer, cats playing with mice, parasites, floods, Nazis, slavery, and starving children all somehow fit..\n \n\n The article you cite, maximus, although interesting, does a fantastic job of skirting the issue. The author concludes again that evil is in human choices, which is where we begin in the catch-22 of the God-created-evil question.\n \n Many people do not believe in a supernatural or religious origin of evil, but that \"evil\" is indeed in our options and choices. Believing in evolution and a lack of morality in nature is not at all incongruous with believing in human morality, despite the author's claims about evolution and moral lassitude. \n \n It is the theist who creates the conundrum when they say that God created everything, and that there is a force of evil in the world (the devil). If you are an atheist who believes in a force of evil, indeed then you have to come up with an origin, but you are still not faced with the contradiction of saying that a God who is love created evil.",
