Saddam, who realized that his secular government was a likely target of AQ (as it has been in the past) refused.\n \n \n\"In mid-1998, the situation reversed; it was Iraq that reportedly took the initiative. In March 1998, after Bin Ladin's publi fatwa against the United States, two al Qaeda members reportedly went to Iraq to meet with Iraqi intelligence. In July, an Iraqi delegation traveled to Afghanistan to meet with the Taliban and with Bin Ladin.\"\n\n \n After it became apparent that BL and AQ were likely to become major players, SH decided that perhaps it would be best for his intel people to get in touch with them and see what the score was. the Mossad, CIA, and intelligence agencies from Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Saudi Arabi and a host of other \"friendly\" nations were known to do the saem thing at about the same time (seek connections to AQ). This is what intelligence agencies do, they attempt to infiltrate or form conenctions to all manner of groups in order to gather intelligence. This is why we call them \"intelligence agencies\", it is not because theya re all super smart.\n \n \n\"Similar meetings between Iraqi officials and Bin Ladin or his aides may have occurred in 1999 during a period of some reported strains with the Taliban. According to the reporting, Iraqi officials offered Bin Ladin a safe haven in Iraq. Bin Ladin declined.\n\n \n You have the wrong sections bolded here. It should be more like this:\n \n \n\"Similar meetings between Iraqi officials and Bin Ladin or his aides may have occurred in 1999 during a period of some reported strains with the Taliban. According to the reporting, Iraqi officials offered Bin Ladin a safe haven in Iraq. Bin Ladin declined.\n\n \n This is what is called a \"hedge\" Nobody is willing to come out and say there is any real evidence of this, or that there are even any substantiated reports of it. Somebody, somewhere, told a CIA agent this, and we were never able to confirm it (most likely chalabi, who has pretty much been completely discredited). \n \n They include things like this because later, if more evidence comes to light, they can play it either way. If it turns out to be true, they can say \"See, we have that in our report\". If it turns out to be false (and frankly, with the revelation that Chalabi is basically a liar and most of our other \"sources\" were apparently rather creative in their reporting), those who wrote the report can say \"We never said it was right, we just said it might have happened based on unsubstantiated information\". \n \n I have seen enough progress reports by project engineers that are behind schedule, over budget, and have hit a brick wall when it comes to design problems to know where the proper emphasis should be on when it comes hedge statements.\n \n \n\"To date we have no evidence that these or the earlier contacts ever developed into a collaborative operational  relationship.\"\n\n \n This is another hedge statement. What they are saying is \"we could find no evidence that there was an operational relationship, but it may come up later\". So, what is the difference between an operational relationship and a non-operational relationship? An operational relationship would most likely involve giving aid in the form of manpower, money, tactical or otyher support. Non, operationl relationship most likely means that Iraqi intelligence officers were doing their job, keeping an eye on a potential enemy (and AQ was DEFINATLY a potential enemy to a secular leader like Saddam Hussein). \n \n \nIt is pretty easy to see that correspondence was occuring frequently and that Iraq even offered Bin Ladin a safe haven. Bin Laden first took the initiative to meet up with Iraq. Then Iraq took the initiative to catch up with Bin Laden. How much more evidence do you need? There is no evidence to prove they had a collaborative OPERATIONAL relationship, meaning they planned 9/11 attacks or other attacks collectively, but there was indeed a relationship and very explicit ties.\n\n \n It is pretty easy to see that it is likely that the CIA or the Mossad has closer \"ties\" to AQ than Iraq did. Just look at the number of AQ members who are (or have been ) arrested since 9/11 (which would be far more impressive if their recruitment levels weren't so high). It wasnt long ago that a CIA offical claimed that the CIA had infiltrated almost all levels of Al Queda. That is a pretty close relationship.",

Following your logic, we should attack every single country where these terrorists were at. Many terrorists trained at Salman Pak in Iraq, which would give us reason to invade. Saddam paid terrorists' families. We didn't know, at the time, that these terrorists were training here. On the other hand, Saddam knew that there was a large training camp with a 757, a train, and other objects for terrorists to use to train. The terrorists here simply took flight lessons.
