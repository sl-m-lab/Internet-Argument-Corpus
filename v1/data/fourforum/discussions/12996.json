You've made a very common mistake, and I'll show you why.\n \n The Hebrew word for day is yown (yom)\n \n Strong&#8217;s 3117 &#8211; yowm (yom)\n \n d. days, lifetime (pl.)\n \n e. time, period (general) \n \n Yowm - Hebrew Lexicon\n \n In Strong&#8217;s Concordance, on page 48 of the definitions, it also has &#8220;or fig. (figuratively) a space of time defined by an associated term&#8221; (and context).\n \n You need to dig deeper into context, which was why I was asking for your specific passage references. \n \n For instance, on the third \"day,\" God formed the land out of the seas. There is no time frame given for the formation of the land and seas. Some time after the land was formed, God created the plants:\n \n Then God said, \"Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with seed in them, on the earth\"; and it was so. (Genesis 1:11)\n \n And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. (Genesis 1:12)\n \n The text clearly states that the earth \"sprouted\" the plants (the Hebrew word deshe, Strong's #H1877, usually refers to grasses). The Hebrew word dasha, (Strong's #H1876) indicates that the plants grew from either seeds or small seedlings in order to have \"sprouted.\" In addition, these plants produced seeds. The Hebrew word here is zera (Strong's #H2233), which is most often translated \"descendants.\" This makes matters very difficult for the 24-hour interpretation. Not only do the plants sprout and grow to maturity, but produce seed or descendants. There are no plants capable of doing this within a 24-hour period of time. Things actually get worse for this interpretation. Genesis 1:12 clearly states that God allowed the earth to bring forth trees that bore fruit. The process by which the earth brings forth trees to the point of bearing fruit takes several years, at minimum. God did not create the trees already bearing fruit. The text states clearly that He allowed the earth to accomplish the process of fruit bearing through natural means. Because the process of the third day requires a minimum period of time of more than 24 hours, the Genesis text for the third day clearly falsifies the interpretation that the days of Genesis one are 24-hour periods of time. Genesis Clearly Teaches that the Days Were NOT 24 Hours\n \n But wait, it gets even worse for you in thinking the Bible stipulates 24 hour \"days.\"\n \n Genesis 2:4 literally reads, \"in the day (yom) of the Lord God making (made) the earth and heavens.\"\n \n Right away, Moses, the author of Genesis, who also wrote of the 'days' of creation, describes those 'days' as one day, or one time period. It's the same Hebrew word. The implication is clear - Moses' &#8220;day&#8221; (yom) in Genesis 2:4 refers not to a 24-hour day but, rather, to a much longer period of time&#8212;in this case, the entire span of creation events.\n \n So, the days of creation can be eons of time, not simply a 24 hour time period or a thousand year period.\n \n Which means, that the age of the earth can be 4.5 billion years and there's nothing in Genesis that says different.\n \n Thus, your argument that the Bible stipulates a 6,000 year old earth, or that the Bible has the age of the earth wrong, is false.",

Let's start at the beginning. \n \n Genesis 1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. 5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\n \n 14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. 19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. \n \n Now your assignment is to dig deep in your strongs concordance and look up the words evening and morning in this context, and let us know if they also translate to words that can be interpreted as eras or periods of time longer than the 12-hour periods we know as evening and morning today. Also tell us what these 2 great lights are, and if they weren't the sun and moon as we know today, then how could these lights be for days and for seasons and for years. And if so, then wouldn't the period of time that the greater light ruled over the day be the same 12-hour period between sunrise and sunset? And vice versa for night?\n \n So was the 4th day a 24-hour period or a long indefinite era?",

And the evening and the morning were the first day.\n \n 14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. 19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. \n \n Now your assignment is to dig deep in your strongs concordance and look up the words evening and morning in this context, and let us know if they also translate to words that can be interpreted as eras or periods of time longer than the 12-hour periods we know as evening and morning today. Also tell us what these 2 great lights are, and if they weren't the sun and moon as we know today, then how could these lights be for days and for seasons and for years. And if so, then wouldn't the period of time that the greater light ruled over the day be the same 12-hour period between sunrise and sunset? And vice versa for night?\n \n So was the 4th day a 24-hour period or a long indefinite era?\n\n \n Tsk tsk....\n \n \"Evening and morning\" is an idiomatic expression in Semitic languages. Like all idioms, its meaning is nonliteral but clearly understood by native speakers. The phrase \"evening and morning\" can, like yom, denote a long and indefinite period. The Old Testament itself unambiguously uses the \"evening and morning\" phrase in just such a way. In Daniel 8 we read the account of Daniel's ram and goat vision and the interpretation given by Gabriel. The vision covers many years; some commentators believe the time has not yet been completed. Daniel 8:26 says, \"The vision of the evenings and the mornings that have been given to you is true, but seal up the vision for it concerns the distant future\" (RSV). In Hebrew manuscripts, \"the evenings and mornings,\" is not in the plural but in the singular, identical to the expression we find in Genesis 1. Translated literally, the verse would red, \"And the vision of the evening and the morning that has been given you\" Here we have a clear indication from scriptural usage that this phrase does not demand a 24-hour-day interpretation and can refer to an indefinite epoch.\n \n One might raise the objection that during the many years between the writing of Genesis and the writing of Daniel, the Hebrew usage could have changed, making the extrapolation from Daniel back to Genesis questionable. My response to such a challenge would be to underscore the stability of the ancient languages (perhaps due to the lack of general literacy and the rigorous professional training of those who served as scribes.) I see no way to escape this example of flexibility usage. \n \n How Long an Evening & Morning\n \n The Hebrew word for evening is ereb, which also means \"sunset,\" \"night\" or \"ending of the day.\" The Hebrew word boqer, translated morning, also means \"sunrise,\" \"coming of light,\" \"beginning of the day,\" or \"dawning,\" with possible metaphoric usage (1). Our English expression: \"The dawning of an age\" serves to illustrate this point. This expression in Hebrew could use the word, boqer, for dawning, which, in Genesis 1, is often translated morning.\n Do all the instances of \"morning\" and evening\" refer to a literal period of time? Here is an example from Moses:\n In the morning it [grass] flourishes, and sprouts anew; Toward evening it fades, and withers away. (Psalms 90:6)\n This verse refers to the life cycle of grass (compared to the short life span of humans). Obviously, the grass does not grow up in one morning and die by the same evening. The period of time refers to its birth (morning) and its death (evening) at least several weeks (if not months) later.\n Biblical Evidence for Long Creation Days\n \n Nice try, though.",

So did moses, being the native speaker at the time, imply that the 7 days in genesis were 7 long eras, and then in exodus refer to those same 7 creation days as 7 actual days, in which the sabbath would be observed once every week, as it has been being observed and is still being observed by the jews?",

   "Scientific Laws, Hypotheses, and Theories - The Scientific Method \nLay people often misinterpret the language used by scientists. And for that reason, they sometimes draw the wrong conclusions as to what the scientific terms mean. \n \n Three such terms that are often used interchangeably are \"scientific law,\" \"hypothesis,\" and \"theory.\" \n \n In layman's terms, if something is said to be \"just a theory,\" it usually means that it is a mere guess, or is unproved. It might even lack credibility. But in scientific terms, a theory implies that something has been proven and is generally accepted as being true. \n \n Here is what each of these terms means to a scientist: \n \n Scientific Law: This is a statement of fact meant to describe, in concise terms, an action or set of actions. It is generally accepted to be true and universal, and can sometimes be expressed in terms of a single mathematical equation. Scientific laws are similar to mathematical postulates. They don't really need any complex external proofs; they are accepted at face value based upon the fact that they have always been observed to be true. \n \n Specifically, scientific laws must be simple, true, universal, and absolute. They represent the cornerstone of scientific discovery, because if a law ever did not apply, then all science based upon that law would collapse. \n \n Some scientific laws, or laws of nature, include the law of gravity, Newton's laws of motion, the laws of thermodynamics, Boyle's law of gases, the law of conservation of mass and energy, and Hook's law of elasticity. \n \n Hypothesis: This is an educated guess based upon observation. It is a rational explanation of a single event or phenomenon based upon what is observed, but which has not been proved. Most hypotheses can be supported or refuted by experimentation or continued observation. \n \n Theory: A theory is more like a scientific law than a hypothesis. A theory is an explanation of a set of related observations or events based upon proven hypotheses and verified multiple times by detached groups of researchers. One scientist cannot create a theory; he can only create a hypothesis. \n \n In general, both a scientific theory and a scientific law are accepted to be true by the scientific community as a whole. Both are used to make predictions of events. Both are used to advance technology.\n\n \n Anyone want to take issue with this?\n \n If not, can we have an honest debate based on what the terms actually mean instead of a dishonest one based what some people want them to mean ?",

   "Let's take another look at ez's argument, shall we? In order to support his irrational position of an old earth creation, he asserts that God created the earth over a long period of time, rather than within 6 24-hour days as stated in genesis. How can he make such a claim, when clearly the genesis story makes numerous references as to exactly what each creation day entailed? (Day = evening and morning, morning being the period of sunrise to sunset, evening being the period of darkness, God dividing the days in half for night time and day time, mentioning the moon and stars, resting on the 7th day, which set the precedent for sabbath observance, etc.) But inspite all this, ez still argues that these \"days\" were idiomatic expressions, rather than literal days. And how could he support such a claim? By citing that the hebrew word for day \"yom\", the word that translates to a literal 24-hour day, can also be used to mean a period of time not necessarily a day in length. That is, the word can be used in an expression such as \"back in the good old days\" to mean many years ago. So the context that the word was used in would obviously suggest what meaning was being implied, exactly as it does in english. \n \n Of course, ez couldn't care less about context, nor about all the other clues that scream obviously that these creation days were 24-hour periods, as the word yom normally translates to. No, ez needs to hold on to the belief that the bible and scientific fact are in accord, so he throws out all of that and grasps onto the baseless and irratioanl assumption that the days in genesis were indeed just idiomatic expressions and that moses at the time of writing was both schitzophrenic and deliberately deceitful in his description of creation, albeit scientifically plausible. \n \n So how exactly do we determine when a word in a biblical passage is being used metaphorically rather than literally as ez did? That's ez! Whenever it allows us to align scripture with our predetermined beliefs of course! Anyone can do it, and so can you!\n \n So I decided to do the same. And it really works! According to the gospels, jesus never died nor resurrected literally. Nope, they when all idiomatic expressions, despite the appearance of being in the context of a historical narrative. Nope, remember, words like \"die\", \"rise\", gave up the ghost\", \"return\", etc were all used in the bible on several occasions to mean things other than the literal meaning. I mean, \"rise again\"? Come on! That could be anything. The sun rises, dough rises, body parts rise, nothing to do with literal resurrection. And it fits into my preconceived notions, so it must be a valid argument. \n \n Right ez?",

No, ez needs to hold on to the belief that the bible and scientific fact are in accord....(and blah, blah blah).\n\n \n \n APPARENTLY YOU WEREN'T CONSCIOUS WHEN I PRESENTED AN ARGUMENT FROM CONTEXT that showed a 24 hour day wasn't possible.\n \n In post # 15 I wrote:\n \n In Strong's Concordance, on page 48 of the definitions, it also has \"or fig. (figuratively) a space of time defined by an associated term\" (and context).\n \n You need to dig deeper into context, which was why I was asking for your specific passage references. \n \n For instance, on the third \"day,\" God formed the land out of the seas. There is no time frame given for the formation of the land and seas. Some time after the land was formed, God created the plants:\n \n Then God said, \"Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with seed in them, on the earth\"; and it was so. (Genesis 1:11) And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. (Genesis 1:12)\n \n The text clearly states that the earth \"sprouted\" the plants (the Hebrew word deshe, Strong's #H1877, usually refers to grasses). The Hebrew word dasha, (Strong's #H1876) indicates that the plants grew from either seeds or small seedlings in order to have \"sprouted.\" In addition, these plants produced seeds. The Hebrew word here is zera (Strong's #H2233), which is most often translated \"descendants.\" This makes matters very difficult for the 24-hour interpretation. Not only do the plants sprout and grow to maturity, but produce seed or descendants. There are no plants capable of doing this within a 24-hour period of time. Things actually get worse for this interpretation. Genesis 1:12 clearly states that God allowed the earth to bring forth trees that bore fruit. The process by which the earth brings forth trees to the point of bearing fruit takes several years, at minimum. God did not create the trees already bearing fruit. The text states clearly that He allowed the earth to accomplish the process of fruit bearing through natural means. Because the process of the third day requires a minimum period of time of more than 24 hours, the Genesis text for the third day clearly falsifies the interpretation that the days of Genesis one are 24-hour periods of time. \n \n Genesis Clearly Teaches that the Days Were NOT 24 Hours\n \n But wait, it gets even worse for you in thinking the Bible stipulates 24 hour \"days.\"\n \n Genesis 2:4 literally reads, \"in the day (yom) of the Lord God making (made) the earth and heavens.\"\n \n Right away, Moses, the author of Genesis, who also wrote of the 'days' of creation, describes those 'days' as one day, or one time period. It's the same Hebrew word. The implication is clear - Moses' \"day\" (yom) in Genesis 2:4 refers not to a 24-hour day but, rather, to a much longer period of time-in this case, the entire span of creation events.\n \n So, the days of creation can be eons of time, not simply a 24 hour time period or a thousand year period.\n \n Which means, that the age of the earth can be 4.5 billion years and there's nothing in Genesis that says different.\n \n Thus, your argument that the Bible stipulates a 6,000 year old earth, or that the Bible has the age of the earth wrong, is false. (end of quotes)\n \n Unkerpaulie, you're taking a real beating around here - fabricating false arguments and getting caught and exposed. You're the one who is a full quart low on context. I recommend you get your facts and accusations straight.",

(figuratively) a space of time defined by an associated term&#8221; (and context).\n \n You need to dig deeper into context, which was why I was asking for your specific passage references. \n \n\n Yeah, the word \"day\" in english means the same thing. It commonly means a 24-hr period of time and it can also mean figuratively a space or time defined by an associated term. See the words \"associated term\"? Look at them. It means that somewhere immediately surrounding the word \"day\" (or yom in hebrew) would be other words that indicate whether or not the figurative meaning is being used. We call that context. You don't jump out of nowhere with the presumption that yom is being used figuratively just because you're ez and its a tuesday. \n \n \nFor instance, on the third \"day,\" God formed the land out of the seas. There is no time frame given for the formation of the land and seas. Some time after the land was formed, God created the plants:\n \n\n Right, there's no timeline, so you just presume that it must have been longer than a single day right? I mean, if the bible doesn't specify a timeline (even though it did here) that means that anybody can just interject their own arbitrary timeline, and its as good as if its officially ammended to the scripture, right? Not only that, but how the heck could God possibly move all the land, form all the mountains, establish all the coastlines, and set the sea limits, all in one day?? That would mean moving billions of tons of earth and rock and water around, good greif not even God could do something like that. I mean, to just imagine that kind of thing being possible in one day, that would require some kind of supernatural power, wouldn't it? And we both know there is no such thing. \n \n \nThen God said, \"Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with seed in them, on the earth\"; and it was so. (Genesis 1:11) And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.

Things actually get worse for this interpretation. Genesis 1:12 clearly states that God allowed the earth to bring forth trees that bore fruit. The process by which the earth brings forth trees to the point of bearing fruit takes several years, at minimum.\n\n Right. And time-acceleration wasn't invented yet. That sounds like some kind of science fiction mumbo-jumbo. I mean who in their right mind would think that God could possibly cause grass, fruit trees, and all other plant life to instantaneously spring into maturity in a single day? Come on! Even if he could move massive volumes of inanimate rocks and water around that quickly, but forcing the process of life to speed up? Nah, no way God is powerful enough to pull that off. \n \n \nGod did not create the trees already bearing fruit. The text states clearly that He allowed the earth to accomplish the process of fruit bearing through natural means. Because the process of the third day requires a minimum period of time of more than 24 hours, the Genesis text for the third day clearly falsifies the interpretation that the days of Genesis one are 24-hour periods of time\n\n I don't know what bible you're reading, but there's no text anywhere near there that clearly states anything of the sort. . \n \n \nGenesis 2:4 literally reads, \"in the day (yom) of the Lord God making (made) the earth and heavens.\"\n \n Right away, Moses, the author of Genesis, who also wrote of the 'days' of creation, describes those 'days' as one day, or one time period.

(end of quotes).\n\n So cool, first moses says that God took 7 days to create the world, then he says that God took a day to create the world. And what do we do in the face of a biblical contradiction? We pretend the contradiction doesn't exist and come up with a totally different and contrarary explanation, such as God took eons to create the world. The fact that we have a clear contradiction as to the length of time creation took obviously implies that easyrider's conclusion is correct and old earth creationism is true. Awesome!",

   "The purpose of showing how resurrection, while not common, at least from a biblical perspective is not unique. Given that other than to fulfill one of many prophesies what is the significance of Jesus' resurrection?\n\n \n The Necessity \n of our Lord's Resurrection\n The resurrection of Jesus Christ is significant because of its necessity. There are several reasons why the resurrection was necessary, and we shall consider some of them below.\n \n (1) The resurrection of Christ was necessary to prove that Jesus Christ was who He claimed to be. Our Lord had clearly claimed to be the son of God, which was the reason why the religious leaders conspired to kill Him (cf. John 19:7). The resurrection was God's proof that the Lord Jesus was Who He claimed to be: the Son of God:\n \n Who was declared with power to be the Son of God by the resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of holiness, Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans 1:4).\n \n (2) The resurrection of Christ was necessary to prove that Jesus Christ had accomplished what He had promised. The death of our Lord alone would not have sufficed, since it is by our identification with Him in His death, burial, and resurrection that we are saved.\n \n Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him. For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life (Rom. 5:9-10).\n \n In 1 Corinthians chapter 15, that great resurrection chapter of the New Testament, Paul argues that apart from Christ's resurrection, we would have no hope:\n \n But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your faith also is vain. . . . For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins (1 Cor. 15:13-14; 16-17).\n \n In his message at Pentecost, Peter taught that the resurrection of Christ by the Father (through the Holy Spirit) was God's vindication of His Son, His message, and His work:\n \n \"This Man, delivered up by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put Him to death. And God raised Him up again, putting an end to the agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in its powers. . . .\n \n This Jesus God raised up again, to which we are all witnesses. Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured forth this which you both see and hear. . . . Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him both Lord and Christ--this Jesus whom you crucified\" (Acts 2:23-24, 32-33, 36).\n \n More reasons in the link\n \n The Significance of the Resurrection | Bible.org",

   "\n \n If Jesus did die then it is fair to say God or at least the Jesus aspect is not Omnipotent.\n \n\n \n No, that would not be correct.\n \n When asked for a 'sign,' Jesus said, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up . . . but he spoke of the temple of his body\" (John 2:19, 21). The ability to raise His life back from the dead was the sign that separates Him not only from all other religious leaders, but also from anyone else who has ever lived. \n \n \n\n \n Reading Archangels post # 68 in the thread \"What year did the word Homosexual appear in the Bible\"\n \n What year did the word \"homosexual\" first appear in the bible\n\n \n That's a worthless strawman. The Bible says man shall not lay with another man... A rose by any other name is still a rose. Gay sex remains a sin (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:26-27,; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, etc.).\n \n \nIn defence of the Trinity he explains from somewhere, the three are one and Jesus' humanity is 1 part of his dual nature.

The plan was for the Son to physically die (John 3:16, etc.). \n \n \nIn theory he could die an infinite number of times only to return each time. Is death real to someone who can just come back at will? Is the significance of the death and resurrection diminished when compared to someone who sacrifices their life completly not a portion while knowing they won't be coming back in a few days.\n\n \n Theories can be endless and extremely time-consuming.

   "This is what Jesus faced in John chapter 8 - and what Stephen faced in Acts chapter 7. You might be interested in what Stephen said then:\n \n \"You stiff-necked people with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit!\"\n \n Now learn the Parable of the Wedding Feast - Matthew 22:1-14\n \n \"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. \"Then he sent some more servants and said, `Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.' \"But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business. The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. \n \"Then he said to his servants, `The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. \"But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. `Friend,' he asked, `how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless. \n \n \"Then the king told the attendants, `Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' \n \n \"For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" \n \n In this Parable:\n \n 1. The King = God the Father \n 2. The Son = God the Son, Jesus Christ\n 3. The first group that was invited = The Israelites who declined\n 4. The second group that was invited = The Gentiles and those Jews who accepted\n 5. The servants = those who preach the Gospel of Christ's salvation\n \n Explanation of the Parable:\n \n God's chosen people, the Jews, were the first to receive the invitation to receive their Savior Jesus Christ, the Son of God whom they rejected. The Wedding / Gospel invitation was then given to others (the gentiles - note Romans 1:16, etc.). In short, everyone had received an invitation, but not everyone accepted the invitation. Note that the Book of Revelation describes a future marriage of the Lamb (Jesus - John 1:29) and His Bride (Revelation 19:7).\n \n The guest who was not arrayed in the proper wedding attire was one who had declined God's gift of salvation and righteousness - a robe of righteousness that comes not from man, but from God only:\n \n Isaiah 61:10, \"I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.\"\n \n Note that in Genesis 15:6, this righteousness comes through faith in God: \"Abram believed (had faith in) the Lord, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\" Also note Ephesians 2:8-9 in the New Testament.\n Believers are covered with God's garment of righteousness / salvation. \n \n When God looks at the repentant sinner He does not see the filthy attire of sin, but the robe of righteousness obtained by Christ's perfect obedience to the law. There are none righteous apart from this God-given righteousness. A perfect example that this righteousness is not obtained by man's own inherent \"goodness\" is found in Zechariah chapter 3:\n \n 3 Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. 4 The angel said to those who were standing before him, \"Take off his filthy clothes.\" Then he said to Joshua, \"See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put rich garments on you.\"\n \n Filthy clothes = sin in the above scripture, while a robe of righteousness = a garment of salvation in Isaiah 61:10.\n \n From the New Testament we find:\n \n Romans 13:14 - \"Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ...\" \n \n Philippians 3:9 - \"..not having a righteousness of my own that comes from (keeping ) the law, but that which is through faith in Christ...\"\n \n Also note that in Matthew 22:10 - \"...the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.\"\n \n Here we see the illustration of those gathered off the streets - people who may well have not been able to afford special wedding garments on such short notice. Also note that those gathered were both \"good and bad,\" so that the invitation was not based on works, otherwise just the \"good\" would have been invited. So the wedding garments - the garments of salvation - were God's gift to those who accepted the invitation to the Son's (Christ's) wedding to his bride - his church of true believers.\n \n In the end, those without the God / Christ-given robe of righteousness / salvation were cast into the outer darkness, where there is weeping and the gnashing of teeth.\n \n \"For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" Matthew 22:14\n \n emoticon_xclown (Gee....you think he's talking about us?)",

One of these is the geological dating position that \"fossils are dated by the type of stratum they are in, while at the same time the stratum is dated by the fossils found in it.\" An alternative evolutionarily statement is that \"the fossils and rocks are interpreted by the theory of evolution, and the theory is proven by the interpretation given to the fossils and rocks.\"\n \n Elsewhere in this Encyclopedia, we will find that circular reasoning is also used in regard to other evolutionary \"proofs,' such as the origin of life, genetics, and mutations. The theory of natural selection is almost totally dependent on curricular reasoning.\n \n As we will see below, geologists admit that this circular reasoning exists as a fundamental pillar of geological faith. For example, in a 1979 interview with *Dr. Donald Fisher, the state paleontologist for New York, Luther Sunderland, asked him: \"How do you date fossils?\" His reply: \"By the Cambrian rocks in which they were found.\" Sunderland then asked him if this were not circular reasoning, and *Fisher replied, \"Of course, how else are you going to do it?\" (Bible Science Newsletter, December 1986, p. 6.)\n \n \"The rocks do date the fossils, but the fossils date the rocks more accurately.

Raup, \"Geology and Creationism,\" Field Museum of Natural History Bulletin, March 1983, p. 21.FOSSILS AND ROCKS: CIRCULAR REASONING\n \n Here's more...\n Evolution's Circular Reasoning and Genomics\n \n When trying to prove their theory, evolutionists often use circular reasoning. Here's a simple example. In his book The Making of the Fittest, Sean Carroll writes \"the degree of similarity in DNA is an index of the [evolutionary] relatedness of species.\" [98] This can only make sense if we first assume evolution is true. But Carroll's book is a defense of evolution, intended to demonstrate to skeptics that the theory is true. He seeks to prove evolution is true, but he begins with evolutionary reasoning and interpretations. That is circular reasoning. Unfortunately such circular reasoning is a common motif in the evolution genre.\n \n In recent years the genomes of various species have been decoded. It is an avalanche of disparate data, as genomes can contain a variety of types of messages. For evolutionists, these messages hold many secrets of evolutionary history. If the species share common ancestors, then the contents of their genomes should help decipher that evolutionary history.\n \n For instance, mobile genetic elements are genome segments that can move about, inserting themselves at various locations within the genome. These insertions, according to evolutionists, are a random affair. After all, evolutionists assume that life is a fluke, and biology is one big kludge.\n \n A few years back evolutionists claimed that retroviruses found in primate genomes proved common descent. The retroviruses, it was said, were the perfect evolutionary sign post. They were assumed to insert randomly into the genome and once inserted to stay put. Therefore, if two cousin species shared a similar pattern of retroviruses, then those retroviruses must have been inherited from a common ancestor. It would be too great of a coincidence for the retroviruses to have independently inserted into the two genomes (notice the circular reasoning).\n \n These assumptions are routinely revised. Retroviruses patterns were found that cannot be explained by common descent (e.g., same pattern in only two of three cousin species). Apparently the retroviruses were not such perfect evolutionary sign posts as had been assumed. But evolutionists viewed such cases as anomalies, and rationalized them using ad hoc explanations. In fact I recently received a challenge to find a retrovirus that violates the evolutionary expectation. That's easy. Such falsifiers have long since been discovered. They are just not advertised.\n \n This dynamic has repeated itself with other types of genetic messages, such as pseudogenes and interspersed elements. Here is what Carroll had to say about the latter:\n \n These landmarks are produced by accidental insertions of junk DNA sequences near genes. ... Once [an interspersed element] is inserted, there is no active mechanism for removing it. The insertion of these elements marks a gene in a species, and is then inherited by all species descended from it. They are really perfect tracers of genealogy. [99]\n \n Except, that is, when they aren't. Like retroviruses, and pseudogenes, interspersed elements occasionally violate the evolutionary pattern. Apparently they are not quite such \"perfect tracers of genealogy.\" To be sure, such outliers are unusual, but if they can be explained by mechanism (rather than inheritance), then so can the others. Carroll concludes that the interspersed elements:\n \n can be explained only by the species sharing a common ancestor. ... biologists have sufficient forensic evidence to determine species' kinship beyond any doubt. [99]\n \n This is, of course, false. In fact, interspersed elements patterns are explained without resorting to a common ancestor and the tremendous problems with such an explanation.Darwin's God: Evolution's Circular Reasoning and Genomics\n \n And I could go on and on but I see no reason to be redundant.

First thing out of their mouth and they bring up such a ludicrous argument? Sad.\n \n Claim CC310:\n Fossils are used to determine the order and dates of the strata in which they are found. But the fossil order itself is based on the order of strata and the assumption of evolution. Therefore, using fossil progression as evidence for evolution is circular reasoning.\n \n Response:\n \n 1. Many strata are not dated from fossils. Relative dates of strata (whether layers are older or younger than others) are determined mainly by which strata are above others. Some strata are dated absolutely via radiometric dating. These methods are sufficient to determine a great deal of stratigraphy.\n \n Some fossils are seen to occur only in certain strata. Such fossils can be used as index fossils. When these fossils exist, they can be used to determine the age of the strata, because the fossils show that the strata correspond to strata that have already been dated by other means.\n \n 2. The geological column, including the relative ages of the strata and dominant fossils within various strata, was determined before the theory of evolution. \n \n -\n -\n -\n \n Oh, and knowing you'll start complaining about the dating methods and such: Radiometric Dating: A Christian Perspective\n \n \n\n And I could go on and on but I see no reason to be redundant. Also, notice how I post actual examples which specifically clarify my assertion rather than just making an unsupported blanket statement which is all we ever get from your side.\n\n \n And I too could go on and on, but given your source has made such a PRATT right away, I see no reason to continue, as it is certainly not trustworthy.\n -\n -\n -\n -\n As to your second source, you're quoting CORNELIUS HUNTER?\n \n Now, this is the same Cornelius Hunter who, when giving a talk showing how similar wolves and thylacines are (and thus, impossible for evolution?) used a reversed and contrast-altered picture of a wolf and called it a thylacine, as if no pictures of thylacines were available, yes?\n \n The same Hunter who, when confronted about this, claimed that it was a \"mistake\"?\n \n Purposefully altering a picture and using it in a presentation to amke a point is a 'mistake'?\n \n \n Mr.Credibility, he ain't.\n \n \n See here: http://austringer.net/wp/index.php/2007/01/26/cornelius-g-hunter-thylacines-wolves-and-images/\n \n \n And here: Pharyngula: They make laughingstocks of themselves, don't they?\n \n From the Second link:\nI could not believe this thread at the antievolution.org forum. Wesley Elsberry pointed out an instance of blatant fraud in a creationist presentation by Cornelius Hunter:\n Then there was the ID conference in San Francisco where Dr. Cornelius G. Hunter, the \"expert\" involved in the antievolution shenanigans in Roseville, CA, presented the wolf and thylacine as identical twins separated at birth argument. His visual aid, handily printed in the proceedings, consisted of two images side-by-side. On one side, you had the usual painting of two thylacines in color. On the other, you had the same painting, mirrored horizontally, and desaturated. Yep, you just could not tell the difference between the wolves on one side and the thylacines on the other. Uncanny, even.\n \n At least, none of the ID attendees cottoned on. It wasn't until I pointed out the problem to Paul Nelson that the ID community had notice of it.\n \n \n Hey, if faking one image is good enough to condemn Ernst Haeckel, it's good enough for Cornelius Hunter, I think. But we're not done. Hunter himself replied, ignoring the accusation that he'd faked his images altogether, and instead citing another source, by biologists, to support his claim of unexplainably great similarities between marsupials and placental mammals.\n  It is strange that evolutionists never get around to addressing the scientific issue. Wesley Elsberry appears to be denying convergence, but that can't be true. If he has an explanation for convergence then let's hear it. If not, then admit it. Here is the question for evolutionists: How is it that similarities such as the pentadactyl pattern are such powerful evidence for evolution, in light of equala and greater levels of similarity in distant species, such as dsplayed in the marsupial and placental mouse?\n \n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/01/4/pdf/l_014_02.pdf\n What's truly delicious there, besides the desperate evasion of the main point, is the quality of the images he then wants us to examine. It's a nice site &#8212; it's PBS's Evolution page &#8212; but that particular pdf is part of a children's section, and it's a picture from a coloring book.\n \n Yeah, marsupials and placentals are indistinguishable from one another&#8230;if you sketch them out in crayon.\n",

   "Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him. For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life (Rom. 5:9-10).\n\n \n So what your saying is that the best way to avoid the wrath of God was to be thankful and appreciate that Jesus submitted to a brutal beating by us and to really make peace with God we then nailed his son to a couple of sticks in the middle of the desert. This is what saves us from an angry God? Are you sure God and Jesus had a good father/son relationship?\n \n \nIn 1 Corinthians chapter 15, that great resurrection chapter of the New Testament, Paul argues that apart from Christ's resurrection, we would have no hope:\n \n But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your faith also is vain. . . . For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins (1 Cor. 15:13-14; 16-17).\n\n \n Read this carefully, there are two problems.\n 1) So despite Paul's third person knowledge of Jesus' resurrection, and his 2nd person knowledge of many others who have been resurrected and his first hand knowledge of the person he ressurected he still tells everyone that their faith is worthless. Yes he does, Are we free from our sins? Are we not still in our sins? There only exists the possibility of salvation at the time of one's death until then enjoy your miserable existance resulting from us still having a sinful nature. \n \n 2) In no way shape or form does this imply a physical resurrection. A spiritual one is more likely for Paul who wasn't converted until after Jesus' death and only experienced him as a loud voice, blinding light and the conversations that only Paul could hear in his head. \n \n In his message at Pentecost, Peter taught that the resurrection of Christ by the Father (through the Holy Spirit) was God's vindication of His Son, His message, and His work:\n \n \n\"This Man, delivered up by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put Him to death. And God raised Him up again, putting an end to the agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in its powers. . . .\n \n This Jesus God raised up again, to which we are all witnesses. Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured forth this which you both see and hear. . . . Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him both Lord and Christ--this Jesus whom you crucified\" (Acts 2:23-24, 32-33, 36).\n\n \n Impossible to be held in death's power, that would be the same as saying he could not be killed. So we are back to the question of how do you kill that which can't be held by death's power? \n \n All this because Peter said so. Maybe Jesus could have jotted down a note, maybe God could have said a few words from heaven, maybe at least one of the 70+ relaible, unbiased third party writers around that time could have mentioned something in any of their writings, but nothing from Jesus, nothing from God and nothing from anybody except biased and/or 2nd or third person claims that very few who lived iin and around where all these dead people are said to be. We don't even know what happened to them.\n \n So it comes down to Jesus had to die and come back so that God would forgive us at the end of our lives if we thought it was nice of Jesus to let us kill him. Killing him even though he is God and it was only the human aspect of his dual nature that was killed while being unable to be held by the power of death was necessary because otherwise we would have thought him to be a liar, even though we have extended indefinatly other promises and of course to bear all our sins for us even though they are still with us. \n \n And you wonder why people are skeptics. My evidence has just as much credibility as yours. \n \n It didn't happen because I said so. \n \n And with their permission I have the Gospels according to Penfold, Accipiter and Trebor which carry as much if not more weight that your Mark, Matthew and Luke.\n \n More reasons in the link\n \n The Significance of the Resurrection | Bible.org[/QUOTE]",

   "The Anvil that Has Worn Out Many Hammers\n \n Nineteenth century writer H.L. Hastings once forcibly illustrated the unique way in which the Bible has withstood the attacks of skepticism: \n \n \"Infidels of eighteen hundred years have been refuting and overthrowing this book, and yet it stands today as solid as a rock. Its circulation increases, and it is more loved and cherished and read today than ever before. Infidels, with all their assaults, make about as much impression on this book as a man with a tack hammer would on the Pyramids of Egypt. \n \n \"When the French monarch proposed the persecution of Christians in his dominion, an old statesman and warrior said to him, 'Sire, the church of God is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.' So the hammers of infidels have been pecking away at this book for ages, but the hammers are worn out, and the anvil still endures. If this book had not been the book of God, men would have destroyed it long ago. Emperors and popes, kings and priests, princes and rulers have all tried their hand at it; they die and the book still lives. \n \n No other book has been so chopped, knived, sifted, scrutinized, and vilified. What book on philosophy or religion or psychology or belles lettres of classical or modern times has been subject to such a mass attack as the Bible? With such venom and skepticism?

   "Ho-hum. What a PRATT. First thing out of their mouth and they bring up such a ludicrous argument? Sad.\n \n Claim CC310:\n Fossils are used to determine the order and dates of the strata in which they are found. But the fossil order itself is based on the order of strata and the assumption of evolution. Therefore, using fossil progression as evidence for evolution is circular reasoning.\n \n Response:\n \n 1. Many strata are not dated from fossils. Relative dates of strata (whether layers are older or younger than others) are determined mainly by which strata are above others. Some strata are dated absolutely via radiometric dating. These methods are sufficient to determine a great deal of stratigraphy.\n \n Some fossils are seen to occur only in certain strata. Such fossils can be used as index fossils. When these fossils exist, they can be used to determine the age of the strata, because the fossils show that the strata correspond to strata that have already been dated by other means.\n \n 2. The geological column, including the relative ages of the strata and dominant fossils within various strata, was determined before the theory of evolution. \n \n -\n -\n -\n \n Oh, and knowing you'll start complaining about the dating methods and such: Radiometric Dating: A Christian Perspective\n \n \n \n And I too could go on and on, but given your source has made such a PRATT right away, I see no reason to continue, as it is certainly not trustworthy.\n -\n -\n -\n -\n As to your second source, you're quoting CORNELIUS HUNTER?\n \n Now, this is the same Cornelius Hunter who, when giving a talk showing how similar wolves and thylacines are (and thus, impossible for evolution?) used a reversed and contrast-altered picture of a wolf and called it a thylacine, as if no pictures of thylacines were available, yes?\n \n The same Hunter who, when confronted about this, claimed that it was a \"mistake\"?\n \n Purposefully altering a picture and using it in a presentation to amke a point is a 'mistake'?\n \n \n Mr.Credibility, he ain't.\n \n \n See here: The Austringer Cornelius G.

   " Of course, there is even less evidence that the mythical supernatural entity known as the 'holy spirit' exists.\n\n \n You love to quote the Old Testament when it suits you. So here's one you can choke on:\n \n The Holy Spirit is a Person - God!\n \n While in Genesis 1:2 we see the \"Spirit of God\" moving upon the face of the waters during creation, there is a very important and often overlooked verse in which the prophet Isaiah reveals that the Holy Spirit is more than just some type of spiritual force. Isaiah 63:10 reads,\n \n \"But they rebelled, and vexed His Holy Spirit: therefore He was\n turned to be their enemy, and He fought against them.\"\n \n The word \"vexed,\" as used above, is the Hebrew word \"atsab,\" which means \"to worry, pain, or anger; to grieve, hurt, or make sorry\" (Zodhiates Old Testament Word Study - Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary section, page 91). The question, of course, is \"How can some inanimate force be angered or grieved, as we see occurred in the above passage? Only if the Holy Spirit was alive and possessed personal attributes could He experience these types of emotions.\" The Holy Spirit must therefore be a person. \n \n Another important verse that shows that the Holy Spirit is one of the \"Creators\" is found in Job 33:4, which reads,\n \n \"The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty\n hath given me life.\"\n \n Obviously, the Holy Spirit must possess intelligence in order to take part in the creative process. Other \"personal\" attributes of the Holy Spirit are as follows:\n \n 1. The Holy Spirit \"testifies\" (Nehemiah 9:30).\n 2. The Spirit \"instructs\" (Nehemiah 9:20).\n 3. The Spirit \"strives with men\" (Genesis 6:3).\n 4. The Spirit sends messengers (Isaiah 48:16).\n 5. The Spirit enabled Joseph to interpret Pharoah's dreams (Genesis 41:38).\n 6. The Spirit gives wisdom (Exodus 28:3; 31:1-6; 35:31).\n 7. The Holy Spirit is the \"Spirit of Wisdom\" (Isaiah 11:2).\n 8. He is the Spirit of Knowledge (Isaiah 11:2)\n \n Notice clearly that all of the things that the Holy Spirit does requires intelligence of the variety that only God alone can possess. This ties God and the Holy Spirit together in a most closely-knit and inseparable unity. \n \n \n \n The big advantage the Q hypothesis has over 'The Holy Spirit' is that we can at least show manuscripts can exist. The same can not be said of 'the holy spirit'. \n\n \n What a crock!! Trebor can't produce even a fragment of a Q manuscript (none has ever been found), but he wants us to be conviced by saying Q manuscripts CAN EXIST! Whoopee! Let's see it then.

   "A taste from another of Goodacre's books (The Synoptic Problem, pgs 18-19):\n \n \nSome, no doubt, will feel that a firmly fixed oral tradition behind the Gospels could explain these data [verbatim agreements of language in the triple tradition; agreements of order in the triple tradition], claiming perhaps that the obsession with written texts is a modern preoccupation. Here, though, we need to notice that there are hints in all three Synoptic Gospels themselves that the connections between them are of a direct, literary kind. First, both Matthew and Mark agree with each other on the interesting narrator&#8217;s aside in the apocalyptic discourse, &#8216;Let the reader understand&#8217; (Mt. 24:15//Mk 13:14, the same three words in Greek). This points clearly and self-consciously to texts that are read&#65279; and to some kind literary relationship between these two Gospels.\n \n Further, Luke&#8217;s Gospel begins with a literary preface in which he mentions the &#8216;narratives&#8217; of his predecessors, implying he sees his task &#8216;to write&#8217; a Gospel as being influenced by and critical of their attempts (Lk. 1:1&#8211;4). If there is one thing that seems clear, it is that there is some kind of literary relationship among the Synoptic Gospels.\n\n \n This last point is particularly important. Easyrider seems to conceive of gospel authorship and inspiration in terms of god beaming the texts of Matt, Mark, Luke and John directly into the Evangelist's heads, their eyes glazing over, and them feverously commiting it all to papyrus. But no one in antiquity thought of it like that -- Papias tells us that Mark was authored by a disciple of Peter who commited to paper what the apostle recounted to him. Luke tells us he was reliant on sources.\n \n ETA: If anyone is interested, Goodacre also has a wonderful podcast on biblical history and exegesis, NT Pod, which can be found here or on iTunes.",

   "Quote from link: In 1 Corinthians chapter 15, that great resurrection chapter of the New Testament, Paul argues that apart from Christ's resurrection, we would have no hope:\n \n But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your faith also is vain. . . . For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins (1 Cor. 15:13-14; 16-17).\n \n \n \n That is, if Jesus were not resurrected.\n \n \n If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. \n \n Meaning resurrection is not just Jesus, that the act of being ressurected is possible if not then Jesus could not have been.\n \n 14And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. 15More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. \n \n \n \n16For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. 17And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.\n\n \n This states that if Jesus has not been raised we are still in our sins or if Jesus has been raised we are no longer in our sins. Are we in our sins still?\n \n \nThat's simply conjecture on your part. The Gospel of John confirms it was a physical resurrection.\n \n \n No it is not. Keep reading Corinthians and Paul clearly makes a distinction between the physical and spiritual and John was written in response to Gnostic claims about Jesus not suffereing, but we were talking about Paul, not John.\n \n \nAlways separate physical death from spiritual death when you ask these kinds of questions, ok?\n \n Jesus died physically. IMO he did not die spiritually.\n\n \n Again If as you have said Jesus is God who is omnipotent, and cannot be held by the power of death, which by the way means he can't die. How would you know if he was dead? God has no need for air, or if he does he makes some. If his physical organs stop working so what they are not really necessary. If he is omnipotent and the physical aspect of the part of his nature that is human should cease to function he can make another the exact same and start over anywhere in the time line he wants. \n \n He cannot be omnipotent and be considered to have given up his life or any part thereof. So he is one or the other or you have to let me know the Christian definition of omnipotent and/or human life.\n \n \nWell, Peter was part of the \"Inner Circle,\" so he should know. He lived with him for over 3 years. Are we then to discount what he reported in favor of your 21st century denial based on pure conjecture?\n\n \n Peter was also getting reprimanded often for speaking before he thought. Well when the closest we can get to the original comes from the 4th century and given Christians history with regards to scribal integrity, twould seem that conjucture runith amuck\n \n \nIn effect, he did. The Bible says all scripture is God breathed / inspiried by God. And Jesus is God.\n\n \n In effect he didn't, and based on the number of bible versions and Christian off shoots his inspiration needs some work.\n \n \n He did, on the Mount of Transfiguration.\n \n \n \n \nTsk tsk.... There's four independent Gospels plus assorted Epistles, and you don't believe any of it. It wouldn't make any difference if there were more. Why don't you just admit you're in denial?\n\n \n There is far more than that. It's just the people in power got to pick what was Christian and what was not. Maybe your in denial, after all your the one who thinks that Faith = Fact and belief = truth\n \n \nBull. Yours is not in the least bit compelling. You weren't there and your arguments haven't panned out.\n \n \n More compelling than your version, 300 years ago I would be the crispy part of the stick I was tied to. Slowly but surely logic and reason will overcome fantasy and fear\n \n That's the most hilarious line I've seen yet. Why don't you just go get 446 more like yourselves and then you can call yourselves the modern day prophets of Baal? \n \n \nPersonally I don't think you want to believe because then you'd have to get off your throne and hand it over to God.\n\n \n Personally I would much rather God exist. I just can't buy into the Christian version or anybody elses for that matter. I would like to think God is better than the human version.",

This goes beyond just having faith. \n \n Of course you won't dare to accept this but the truth is the entire premise starts with Jesus is the Son of God and then look for evidence to support the claim in the Bible. This is of course necessary since if one takes the bible and applies it to Jesus the certainty of his divinity comes crashing down. \n \n Comaparing what Jesus did to the stories of other figures in the bible and outside the bible he did nothing significant. It isn't until someone tells you that it is significant that it becomes so. \n \n The Christian/Jew/Muslim is brought up to beleive his version of the God/Man is correct. The words of his book are significant, meaningful and necessary. He must not confuse the truths found there with the similiar but false characters and events of others. \n \n But if no one told you which one how would you know Jesus over Osiris, Mohammed over Dionysus Romulus over hasn't arrived yet, but coming eventually? \n \n The fact that Paul had to write to the Corinthians to affirm the resurrection means the idea had been questioned and the disbelief was gaining momentum. Remember at this time the entire Christian Doctrine is in the heads of a few people. There is no Mark, Matthew, Luke or John yet. The churches in Rome don't have copies of all the letters to the Corinthians who don't have copies of the letter to the Galatians. Paul never met a physical Jesus, his only experience was of a spiritual Jesus. The letter to the Corinthians reflects this repeatedly making the distinction between physical and spiritual. If Paul wanted to insure a physical resurrection was taught he would have done so and not wait another decade for John to do it for him. \n \n The letters were not written as a whole, they were written one at time at different periods addressing different concerns. The fact is without later writings the letter to Corinthians does not support anything other than a spiritual ressurrection. Paul would be flat out lying to suggest he had anything other that what he was told regarding a physical ressurection.\n \n Which leads to why later it became necessary to push the physical ressurection. As you have pointed out numerous times within this thread, Jesus only died a physical death, he did not die a spiritual death. That's a problem, because no spiritual death means no bearing of our sins and no spiritual ressurrection means no salvation. \n \n What evidence for a physical resurrection is given in 1 Corinthians?",

How do you think Paul conceived of Jesus' resurrection and the resurrection of believers?\n\n \n I didn't say Paul denies a physical resurrection.

He explains the difference between physical and spiritual bodies \n \n 35But someone may ask, \"How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?\" 36How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. 37When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. 38But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. 39All flesh is not the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another. 40There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another. 41The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor. \n 42So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; 43it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; 44it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\n If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. 45So it is written: \"The first man Adam became a living being\"[e]; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit. 46The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. 47The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven. 48As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. 49And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we[f] bear the likeness of the man from heaven. \n \n 50I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. 51Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed- 52in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. 53For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. 54When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: \"Death has been swallowed up in victory.\"[g] \n 55\"Where, O death, is your victory? \n \n Maybe I am wrong but it seems pretty clear that the physical is not what is coming back. Therein lies the problem. The post you question is in response to ER statement that the resurrection was physical in response to my claim it was spiritual. When I pointed out the spiritual aspect of 1 Corinthians he said the physical is made clear in John. Which is silly, Corinthians was written well before John and is meant to instruct on it's own, not awaiting clarification from another source at a later date.\n \n The significance of all of this is ER on at least 3 seperate posts within this thread staes the ressurection was physiacl and the spiritual aspect of Jesus did not die. Which causes the conflict that John was written to overcome. That is if the Spiritual did not die then it cannot be resurrected and if the physical was not resurrected, how can there be salvation? \n \n Other posibilities include someone made a mistake regarding the foundation of Christianity. Someone comes up with yet another fascinating explaination to explain why the problem really isn't there (usually the equivelant of a circle is a square with round corners or a triangle is really a three sided square.) We just pretend it's not there and maybe it will go away. We just change it so it reads the way it is supposed to and then claim it has always been that way 100 years from now or we can look into maybe the resurrection really isn't what tradition says it is, but Paul bet the farm on it so not likely.",

He doesn't say what it is actually comprised of and philosphically we can go back and forth on what is reality, but Paul intentionally made a distinction between physical and spiritual, but you keep hammering away with, but what is spiritual either for Paul or myself.

   "Paul makes a distinction between physical and spiritual.\n\n \n What Paul actually says is that the resurrection is spiritual, and that the resurrection body will not be made of flesh and blood. I demonstrated that the adjective \"spiritual\" does not imply non-physicality nor that the noun it modifies is made of spirit. I also pointed out that to be made of something other than flesh and blood is not necessarily to be non-physical, as there were believed to be plenty of physical substance a body could be made out of. Before the end of the patristic period, for example, angels were belived to be physical beings composed of highly rarefied, supernatural substances.\n \n But we will deal with your \"objections\" to these points below.\n \n \nHence the reason for the 3 days. The spirit would stay near the body until it could not recognize the face. Once that happened it would leave the body.\n\n \n It's pretty clear that Paul's resurrection has nothing to do with the soul leaving the body; 1) that is not what the word \"resurrection\" meant, 2) it is clear that Paul's resurrection occurs at the parousia, even for those Christians that had already died (1 Thess 4). How could he be envisioning transmigration of the soul if the dead had to wait for Jesus' return?\n \n \nYes, I am going to have to go with Paul is saying that the resurrection body is not going to be your flesh and blood body you were born with. I am sure the people who died of fire or were eaten by animals found that idea reassuring. There could be other physical things maybe water, maybe butter but wouldn&#8217;t Paul say water or butter instead of spiritual?\n\n \n But \"spiritual\" does not mean \"made of spirit\" or \"non-physical\" as I already explained. Which brings us to...\n \n \nUmmm No. Cor 10:3-4 is not talking about a roasted chicken leg washed down with a little red. He is speaking of Moses and the Jews as they walked under the cloud (God) their spirits (souls) were nourished (the meat and drink) by the strength of Christ (the rock). Sounds pretty &#8220;not physical&#8221; to me.\n\n \n Paul is alluding to the Exod narrative. The \"spiritual food\" is the quail and bread. The \"spiritual drink\" is water, and the \"spiritual rock\" is that from which the water folowed.\n \n Now, what does this mean, pappillion? It means that for Paul, use of the adjective &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; does not mean the noun it modified is non-physical. Quail is physical, right? Bread is physical? It means that for Paul, use of the adjective &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; does not imply the noun it modified is made of spirit. It is spiritual in that it is god-given.\n \n Get it, pappillion? If the adjective &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; does not imply non-physicality or composition out of spirit, why would this mean the &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; post-resurrection body be non-physical and/or made out of spirit?\n \n \nYour coming up with &#8220;soulish&#8221; is creative, funny how everyone else comes up with natural, referring to that which we have in common with animals, the lower aspect of man, but I can see how soulish would work for you.\n\n \n Hehe, this is cute. Pappillion, the word is &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#957; (which we can transliterate as psychikon), an adjectival form of the word \"soul.\" There is nothing creative about it, just a literal translation. Hence (LSJ):\n \n &#968;&#8161;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;, &#942;, &#972;&#957;, of the soul\n \n ;)\n \n \nWhen did Paul become a metrosexual? Will we be &#8220;ish&#8221;ing anything else?\n\n \n Is there some other adjectival form of the English \"soul\" you'd perfer? I mean, to get you to focus on the issue at hand.\n \n \nPathetic.\n\n \n You're confused buddy, but then again, you're new to this stuff. I'll forgive your outburst. \n \n \nSee this is why I have a hard time with you. You make your point in Greek, which most are not going to have a clue what &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; or any of the rest of it is and then screw it up that bad.\n\n \n The NT was written in Greek, pappillion, and solid exegesis requires some familiarity with it. Nothing was screwed up, and I provided translations.\n \n It might do you some good to try to learn the language. Then, we could all avoid the sorts of errors you made above.\n \n \nAfter your above performance I am not going to bother with this other than asking was it a physical or spiritual Jesus that converted Paul?\n\n \n Good idea. By ignoring 1 Cor 15.45, you ignore another reason why your case can't work. ;)\n \n \nYour not doing to well here, maybe we should go back to the resurrection in general, that is after all the topic.\n\n \n Have you been following the same conversation? Let's recap:\n \n I asked if you thought the resurrection was non-physical for Paul because he says the resurrection body will not be made of flesh and blood. I pointed out that this does not mean the body will be non-physical because there are plenty of other things it could be made out of. Your response was to say that Paul says it was \"spiritual,\" again with the implication that \"spiritual\" means \"non-physical.\" But this was exactly the view I had already refuted with 1 Cor 10 and 1 Cor 15. Which brings us to...\n \n I brought up 1 Cor 10 to show that Paul can speak of \"spiritual\" things that are entirely physical. Strangely, you seem to agree that the \"spiritual food\" and \"spiritual drink\" was meat and water, but then immediately turn around and say that this sounds \"non-physical\"!\n \n I brought up how Paul uses the adjective &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#957;, and how this helps know how we shouldn't read Paul. Your response was to over-confidently assert that my translation was in error, despite the fact that I can speak Greek and you cannot. The entry from the LSJ should clear that up.\n \n I brought up how Paul uses the noun &#968;&#965;&#967;&#951; (guess what this word means?), and how this tells us how not to read Paul's use of the noun &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945; (spirit). Your response? Well, there was none.\n \n Given that none of these things point to a non-physical resurrection, would you like to try to make a case again?",

   "Here is N.T. Wright, The Resurrection of the Son of God, pgs. 349-50, making my point with different examples:\n \n \nWe have, in fact, already met the key terms, in contexts where it should be quite clear what Paul means -- and does not mean -- by them. The two sorts of 'body', the present corruptible one and the future non-corruptible one, are, respectively, psychikon and pneumatikon; the first word is derived from psyche, frequently translated 'soul', and the second from pneuma, normally translated 'spirit'. In 1 Corinthians 2.14-15, the psychikos person does not receive the things of the spirit, because they are spiritually discerned, while the pneumatikos person discerns everything. There is, of course, no question there of 'physical' and 'spiritual' as appropriate translations. Nor would those words, with the connotations they normally have today, be appropriate at 3.1, where Paul declares that he could not consider the Corinthians as pneumatikoi, but merely as sarkinoi or perhaps sarkikoi. The words clearly refer to matter quite other than whether the people concerned as 'physical'; clearly they are, and the question is rather to do with whether they are indwelt, guided and made wise by the creator's Spirit, or whether they are living at the level of life common to all humanity (psychikos), or whether indeed they are living at the level of life common to all corruptible creation (sarkinos). So, too, when Paul discusses pneumatika in chapter 12, these 'spiritual gifts' are certainly not 'spiritual' in the sense of 'non-physical', but involve in most cases the operation of the Spirit precisely on aspects of one's physicality, whether through gifts of inspired speech, healing, or whatever. They are things which, though operating within the human body and life, enable that body and life to do things which would otherwise be impossible. The same is true of many other uses of the word, in this letter and elsewhere in the New Testament.\n\n \n And just for fun, page 351 (emphasis mine):\n \n \nIn fact, if Paul had wanted to find a word for 'non-physical', psychikos (which could literally be translated as 'soulish') would itself have been a possible options.\n\n \n ;)",
