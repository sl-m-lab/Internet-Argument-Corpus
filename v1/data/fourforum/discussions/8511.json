I may as yet post such an explaination, and those who were intrigued by my summary may bother to read it.\n \n I was trying to make a point to which my particular understanding of the almighty need not necessarily enter in ( I am neither a Witness nor a Moslem):\n \n That if the only choice one faced was between atheism and modern Christianity, then stanleyg's question would be reasonable. If, however, we account for the myriad theologies under which God would be severely alienated by our embrace of traditional Christian faith, then we understand that it is not simply a chioce between potential payoff (Christian paradise) and non-reward (atheist death-as-obliteration) but a careful journey towards an understanding of God. \n \n In that sort of quest one must tread lightly: if one opts for the easy formulaic solutions offered by religions such as Christianity, one may find that he has activated himself in spirit, only to find that he has abandonned his creator.\n \n Nothing is easy. The world would not take the often confusing shape that it does if God intended our paths to him/her to be so simplistic.",
