   "I've abstracted this topic from the 'ARJ' thread where it was lost in the general melee. If possible I'd like to keep this one focused on the subject in hand and avoid any squabbles over who said what to whom and when.\n \n Of the points raised the most interesting concerned the role of fossil evidence in supporting the theory of evolution, and the inferences drawn from genetic similarities between ourselves and other primates. The validity of dating methods was also briefly called into question, but since AA kindly offered to simplify matters by assuming for the sake of argument that they are as accurate as they claim to be, I'll defer that subject to a future discussion.\n \n The principle issue was that of scientists interpreting fossil evidence as 'transitional'. AA, your stated view was that they are merely fitting what they find into their preconceived worldview and that the fossils constitute no genuine evidence supporting the ToE. You have opined that unless these remains can be proved to be ancestral to modern humans, they are meaningless.\n \n As to the first claim, its potency depends on the assumption that scientists would, and could, fit absolutely any fossil evidence at all, no matter what it was, into the theory of evolution. This is demonstrably not the case. \n \n The ToE makes specific predictions: transitional fossils must only ever be found in strata older than that in which fossils of daughter species are found. Furthermore, common descent requires that the history of life be a branching tree, with body parts evolved on one branch never being found combined with body parts evolved on a distant, long-seperated branch. Find one mammal with feathers and as I understand it the theory is just so much waste paper; it cannot be amended to accommodate such a creature.\n \n In short, there are only a very small subset of all conceivable fossil finds in all conceivable strata that can fit into the ToE. That's what makes the fact that they invariably do fit it so remarkable and significant.\n \n So how come scientists keep changing their minds? How come new fossil finds can 'rewrite the history of life on earth' as we sometimes hear?\n \n The answer is that although the subset of fossil finds that describe a tree of life (and thus fit the ToE) is relatively tiny, there are still many, many potential trees of life, and it's always possible that where we have made deductions or educated guesses about what some part of it looks like in detail, a later find can inform us differently. \n \n Secondly, the issue of genetic similarity and its implications. AA, you highlighted the tiny genetic difference between chimps and humans and contrasted that with the tremendous lifestyle differences between the species, calling into question the idea that the one could really be responsible for the other.\n \n The first point to make is that such an idea - that every difference is genetically traceable - does not reflect scientific thinking. I vividly recall seeing a programme about a girl who had through some misadventure been raised by dogs from a very young age, and who behaved in every respect in canine fashion. This highlights the significance of the accumulated social 'DNA' we pass down from generation to generation: our language, knowledge, myths, etiquette and so forth. Deprive a person of that aspect of his humanity and he will not be recognisable as human in anything other than gross physical form. Every parent knows how important it is to stimulate a young child and help it latch on to concepts that will be important in later life - and even then a facility for reading is not guaranteed.\n \n And don't forget the accumulated technological infrastructure we inherit. While we might instinctively feel very superior, conversing around the world on our electronic devices while the chimps hoot at each other from adjacent trees, it's worth remembering that none of us - probably no individual on earth - would actually have the expertise necessary to create a computer from first principles out of rocks and ores and oil. Fire and a sharp stick is probably the best most of us could leverage over a wild chimp were we to be suddenly placed on equal terms with them in their environment.\n \n So by denying a person their rightful payload of social DNA and accumulated infrastructure, we narrow the gap between human and chimpanzee considerably. What of the differences that remain? Well, so far as we can tell, they are differences of degree, not kind. Chimps have language, a complex and political social structure within a troop; they clearly feel emotion and appreciate humour. I recall one story of a troop led by a particularly large and bullish male who one day fell out of a tree and injured his hand. Long after the injury had healed, the smaller males could be seen feigning his limping walk as they followed him through the jungle - except when he looked around.\n \n So can a 2% genetic change make that much difference?\n \n To answer that, let's ask the question: how different is a one-bedroom bungalow from a huge ornate mansion? At first glance they represent massively different lifestyles and are worlds apart. But what if you factor into the 'similarity equation' the tools used in their construction? The tradeskills employed? The copper piping that plumbs them both? The machinery that made that copper piping? Same with the wiring and the machinery that made that? The technology used to extract and process the clay, cement and other resources? The lorries, roads and road signage that conveyed the resources to their destination?\n \n When you take into account everything they have in common, a bungalow and a mansion are extremely similar in nature. The same is true for chimps and humans. We have a bigger and more convoluted brain which allows us to handle more sophisticated thoughts and empathise with our more sophisticated peers, a more adaptable voicebox and mouthparts that permit more complex and nuanced communication - all of which have evolved in parallel with our increased use of them, which at every stage has provided a competetive advantage. Apart from those things, what would a chimp need to realise the same potential that we eventually have?\n \n Anyway, this is long enough for a first post so I'll leave it there.",

AA, your stated view was that they are merely fitting what they find into their preconceived worldview and that the fossils constitute no genuine evidence supporting the ToE. You have opined that unless these remains can be proved to be ancestral to modern humans, they are meaningless.\n\n \n My issue with marrying up fossils with modern humans in any way is based on the fact that 1) we NEVER start out with complete or pristine examples of the original fossilized creature being compared to the modern human. An example of the assumptions that bother me and can't be denied that are based on preconceived notions is the Lucy exhibit which shows her for the most part in hairless form, making her appear far more human than she was in reality. They also make her appear more upright than I believe she was. \n \n I believe Lucy was just another species of Ape, Monkey or Chimp that went extinct due to either a change in her ecosystem, environment or as part of the food chain by a more powerful animal of the period. That their is no real evidence to assume that she was as hairless as she was as we have no flesh samples to confirm the size of her pores. But that doesn't stop evo from making these huge assumptions and presenting them as facts by making life size Lucy's in living color that contain these features that promote their \"PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS\".\n \n Another problem I have that feeds this preconceived notion assertion is the mislabeling of these allegedly ancient fossils by referring to them as Java MAN, Peking MAN, Neanderthal MAN when they weren't absolutely, necessarily men at all, but simply primates that are assumed once again, to be related to us. Regarding the Java Man, How is this skull cap evidence of anything concrete?\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/java15000.html\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/java.html\n \n According to this source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Man The brain size of Java was larger than the largest modern Ape at about 950 Grams. But the human adult brain is 1300 to 1400 Grams. And notice the slope and brow of this animal. By what standard of evidence can we say with any assurance that this is definitely a precursor of what is today the Homo Sapien?\n \n \nAs to the first claim, its potency depends on the assumption that scientists would, and could, fit absolutely any fossil evidence at all, no matter what it was, into the theory of evolution. This is demonstrably not the case. \n \n The ToE makes specific predictions: transitional fossils must only ever be found in strata older than that in which fossils of daughter species are found. Furthermore, common descent requires that the history of life be a branching tree, with body parts evolved on one branch never being found combined with body parts evolved on a distant, long-seperated branch. Find one mammal with feathers and as I understand it the theory is just so much waste paper; it cannot be amended to accommodate such a creature.\n\n \n The strata is another real problem for evolution, because we all know that some fossils that are presumed to be from millions to hundreds of millions of years old have been found on or near the surface of the Earth. We have also found specimens of T-Rex that has been dated to 60 million years old recently with soft tissue intact that was so pristine that they hope to get a complete DNA sample from it, and in fact may have by now. \n \n This discovery defies common sense and breaks so many other accepted facts as to leave one incredulous. Science has accepted that the minerals found in the Earth such as lime and natural acids will corrode wood, metals, fabrics if kept buried for just Centuries, much less hundreds of millions of years. And yet evolutionists will proudly announce the discovery of a 65 million year old T-Rex containing soft tissue and expect skeptics to receive that as proof that evolution is based on facts and common sense? It is much more reasonable at face value that T-Rex walked the Earth much more recently than previously believed and that our dating methods are in need of reconsideration.\n \n Here is one explanation of how evolutionists explain the inconsistencies found in Strata layers and again it assumes much in order to make the pieces fit as they need them to fit in order for evo to remain a rational science as they see it.\n http://www.rae.org/revev2.html\n EXPECTED\n \n Cretaceous \n Jurassic \n Triassic \n Permian Pennsylvanian Mississippian Devonian \n Silurian \n Ordovician \n Cambrian Precambrian\n \n ACTUAL\n \n Precambrian Cretaceous\n \n The Lewis Overthrust\n \n First identified by Willis in 1901, this area encompassing Glacier National Park is more than 300 miles long and 15#50 miles wide, with Precambrian strata resting on top of Cretaceous.1 The fossils are in the wrong order. Evolutionists date the Precambrian rock at a billion years; the Cretaceous at 150 million years. The contact line between the two different strata is like a knife-edge, suggesting that instead of an overthrust, the strata were water-deposited in that order. This contact line can be clearly seen at Chief Mountain, with the older strata resting directly on top of the younger.2\n \n Since evolutionists suppose the Precambrian era to be the age before life evolved, and the Cretaceous period to be the age of the dinosaurs, the entire evolutionary time scale is at stake. The idea that such a large section of the Rocky Mountains uplifted and slid twelve to fifty miles to the east without leaving any evidence of movement is incredible. It is more reasonable to believe that the geological time scale is in error.\n \n Evolutionists have proposed two theories, one that a massive fold got started in the earth's crust, sheared, and forced to the east3, the other that the block of strata slid down a slope.4 The biggest problem with both theories is the size of the rock sheet. In order for an overthrust of the entire geologic column to occur, the original rock sheet would have been three miles high. A three-mile high, 12,000 square mile rock sheet doesn't tend to slide anywhere or overturn easily. The forces required to move it would have exceeded the crushing strength of the rock.\n \n We investigated the Lewis Overthrust with creation geologist Michael Oard in August 2002. He showed us the contact at Marias Pass from a distance, and you can get a perspective of the magnitude of the problem. Near Trick Falls at the Two Medicine campground, we hiked to an area where a flood in 1964 exposed the contact. Michael showed us a Ph.D. thesis that was written about this area, and the researcher puzzled over the problem that the slickensides were 90 degrees from the expected direction of the rock movement, and the integrity of the underlying strata does not justify an overthrust of the magnitude expected.\n So you see, at every single aspect, angle, level and particular belief regarding the so called science of evolution, the proponents must take the existing undeniable and irrefutable facts, such as the existing strata and then come up with new theories to explain why reality contradicts the preconceived notions that is Evolution.\n \n As this post is full, I will post the next section of your OP and respond to it on the next page.",

It also shows that people are flexible and versatile as we can adapt to almost anything in order to survive. But let's reverse your scenario and see if it is consistent when animals are placed with humans? Does the dog, which has been domesticated for centuries now, when adopted by a family as a puppy, adapt to its humans and learn how to be as humans are because of their closeness to us? Do dogs learn table manners, or to use silverware? Do they learn to use the toilet or to bathe themselves? Do they learn and retain any specialized knowledge just by being around us for their whole lives, even when adopted as puppies? Of course not. But if memory serves that young girl had climbed to an alpha position within that pack of dogs that adopted her. Here's one example of a feral child.\n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu8aZw7FHpV4B5CBXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTExY3JtOGZhBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNARjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAwRsA1dTMQ--/SIG=11veqt8o2/EXP=1202918681/**http%3a//www.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/5145\n \n \nAnd don't forget the accumulated technological infrastructure we inherit.

Long after the injury had healed, the smaller males could be seen feigning his limping walk as they followed him through the jungle - except when he looked around.\n \n\n \n This is an interesting perspective Peeling, but it takes an awfully lot for granted. For example, don't forget that according to the ToE we started out with all other primates on perfectly equal footing technologically. Evolution not only implies that we evolved from lower life forms but learned, created new technologies and remembered what we learned in ways that allowed us to pass them along to future generations that improved upon them and sent us forward to the level we're at today. \n \n The big question for me remains why only Man has learned and evolved the higher brain functions of creativity, long term memory, and imagination beyond the limitations of what is based on inherited instincts as animals are so limited by. If you took a human being today and dropped him in a forest or jungle, he would immediately look for a sharp rock to cut wood with, and after making a shelter he would find a flint and stone to start a fire with. Once he accomplished the basics, he would make a weapon and hunt for meat. \n \n I would then pick out a primate to follow and track him until he led me to his fresh water source, so I would learn from him. But would that troop of monkeys whom I have become neighbors with learn to duplicate my shelter, or to make fire, or to make a weapon for self defense? Of course not. Not in a million or a hundred million years which is evidenced by the fact that we alone stand at the pinnacle of life on Earth as the only creatures who learn and improve from ONE generation to the next. \n \n The lower primates wont even observe my creativity and understand that it will make their lives easier too. Yet according to evo we all climbed out of the same exact puddle of primordial ooze at the same exact time, so we have had the same amount of time to adapt and evolve to the World around us. Yet only Man has accomplished such forward thinking capabilities.\n \n More to come, but I have business to deal with.",

Apart from those things, what would a chimp need to realise the same potential that we eventually have?\n \n Anyway, this is long enough for a first post so I'll leave it there.\n\n \n What you're saying with your comparison of a bungalow and a mansion with the human and a chimp is that the same materials go into the creation of both structures. And no one denies that all mammals are made up of flesh and bone by way of a common, or similar biology. But look at the difference in outcomes of such similar biology's, as with the differences and capabilities of a mansion as compared to a bungalow. The Mansion could be used as a Hotel, a bed and breakfast or a private club, where as a bungalow will always be just a single family unit. It is very real evidence that in order to explain why humans are so much more advanced and superior to the other primates must be something much deeper that that 2% difference in DNA, or the biology which we can't define or explain. This evidence tells me that our differences are spiritual. Deeper than science can explain with biology. \n \n That is what Genesis tells us. The Judeo-Christian ethic tells us that God created all animals with love and great care, yet He created Human beings in His image with His characteristics and free will. And why did He give us free will? Because if we were created to just serve His will as Angels were, then He would have accomplished nothing new and unique with us. God wanted creatures who would choose to love Him without coercion which is why He never forces Himself on us but will only respond to our desire to seek and know Him.\n \n Many humanists raise the issue of the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and accuse God, if He is real of being a sadist for allowing such a choice when if He sees all, He must have known in advance that Adam and Eve would fail and fall from grace. What they fail to understand is that although God must have had prior knowledge of the Fall from Grace, He was also creating us in His image for a long term relationship which would extend long past Adam and Eves deception and fall from grace. God saw us today; He saw me in my mothers womb, and He hungered to know me as I grew up before Him. And that applies to all of us. And He knew that some would reject Him, and that others would hunger for Him yet fail miserably due to that fallen nature that poisons this flesh we live within.\n \n But to try to explain the differences between Man and all other life by saying that we just randomly, or through Natural Selection just happened to evolve as we have while leaving all other life in the dust of imagination and creativity just boggles the mind and stretches the laws of credibility to the limits of credulity in my opinion.",

   "I'm going to have to take this piecemeal too. Never enough time!\n \nMy issue with marrying up fossils with modern humans in any way is based on the fact that 1) we NEVER start out with complete or pristine examples of the original fossilized creature being compared to the modern human.\n\n True, of course, and inevitable as I'm sure you'd agree. Nevertheless, these variably incomplete fossils do exhibit that which is predicted by evolutionary theory: a blend or mixture of characteristics which trends towards the morphology of modern humans in progressively more recent strata.\n \n What you might be overlooking is that the inference of a close relationship to human ancestry of these fossils is drawn not only from their correlation with evolutionary theory, but from the correlation of all fossils with evolutionary theory. Do you appreciate the logic here? If 'transitional' hominid fossils were the only ones found, and all others were an unordered hodgepodge that contradicted common descent, a case could be that the apparent hominid 'transition' is a fluke. It would be the exception to the rule. But that is not the case. All fossils thus far recovered correlate with common descent - so what grounds do you have for making an exceptional interpretation of the hominid fossil evidence?\n \nAn example of the assumptions that bother me and can't be denied that are based on preconceived notions is the Lucy exhibit which shows her for the most part in hairless form, making her appear far more human than she was in reality. They also make her appear more upright than I believe she was.\n\n Should the first bolded part have been more like the second, or do you have some evidence to back you up? :)\n \nI believe Lucy was just another species of Ape, Monkey or Chimp that went extinct due to either a change in her ecosystem, environment or as part of the food chain by a more powerful animal of the period.\n\n And you're perfectly entitled to believe that, so long as you understand that doing so entails believing that this seperate species, which you claim lived alongside chimps and humans from the very beginning, just happened to leave a fossil in precisely the right stratum to make it look transitional. Just like all the other hominid fossils.\n \n Are you starting to see my point yet? You're trying to claim that because Lucy isn't conclusive proof, she means nothing. That's fallacious reasoning: Lucy contributes to the accumulated evidence supporting common descent. \n \n I don't find Lucy's bones, in isolation, to be convincing evidence of common chimp/human ancestry. Even their discovery in just the right stratum isn't on its own completely convincing - it could be a fluke. But how many such flukes can one plausibly hypothesise? All the hundreds of other Australopithecus afarensis fossils dug up, for instance - surely some of them ought to have been found in anomalous strata if they had really coexisted with all other species from the beginning.\n \nThat their is no real evidence to assume that she was as hairless as she was as we have no flesh samples to confirm the size of her pores.\n\n Hairless or hairy - I don't see how even a speculative artist's impression invalidates the actual fossil evidence. \n \n \nAnother problem I have that feeds this preconceived notion assertion is the mislabeling of these allegedly ancient fossils by referring to them as Java MAN, Peking MAN, Neanderthal MAN when they weren't absolutely, necessarily men at all, but simply primates that are assumed once again, to be related to us.\n\n As opposed to primates that, once again by pure fluke, just happened to only ever leave fossils in just the right strata to appear transitional.\n \n You're annoyed by the presumption of this labelling system because you haven't been convinced of the evidence that underpins it - and that's perfectly understandable. But many people, pretty much every scientist in the world included, are convinced by the evidence. \n \n When someone is convicted of a crime, the TV and newspapers stop talking about the 'alleged' victim and 'alleged' offence and just call the guy a murderer. Should they continue to pussyfoot around to avoid offending the sensibilities of skeptical laymen who haven't even followed the trial proceedings?\n \nBy what standard of evidence can we say with any assurance that this is definitely a precursor of what is today the Homo Sapien?\n\n We can't, of course, and nobody does. The likelihood of finding a direct ancestor's remains is very small and the possibility of confirming such a relationship nonexistent. Java man, like all other fossils, is most likely a cousin to our great-to-the-nth-grandfather. Does that disqualify him from being a hominid? Of course not - if your mother's sister dies without issue, she still counts as human even though she will not be ancestral to any later humans.\n \n \nThe strata is another real problem for evolution,\n\n And we will get to that, but I'd really like to keep this discussion on track.\n \n That'll have to do for now, it's 2:30am and I have work tomorrow.",

   "My issue with marrying up fossils with modern humans in any way is based on the fact that 1) we NEVER start out with complete or pristine examples of the original fossilized creature being compared to the modern human.\nFirst, why on earth would you expect pristine examples of fossilized creatures? However, we certainly can compare a knee (with the lower end of a femur and the upper end of a tibia) to a human knee and the knees of the extant great apes. The result was that it more resembled a human knee than that of an ape. And yet, it is more than 3 million years old. The knee is from an bipedal primate.\n \nAn example of the assumptions that bother me and can't be denied that are based on preconceived notions is the Lucy exhibit which shows her for the most part in hairless form, making her appear far more human than she was in reality.\nI can deny them because you are just blowing smoke. The Lucy exhibit actually shows Lucy to be quite hairy; very similar to a chimp in that regard. In fact, the representation of Lucy appears quite ape-like (hairy body, long arms with curved fingers, pronounced canines [more than humans but less than apes], protruding lower face, large and chinless lower jaw, flat and broad nose, pronounced brow ridge, small slanted forehead, and low cranial vault with a quite small brain) except that she is walking upright. I'm not sure why you think that the representation of what Lucy probably looked like is somehow human-like. Where did you grow up that you think that she looks human-like?\n \n By the way, when were you in Houston to visit the Lucy exhibit? It would be dishonest to talk about what you saw there if you hadn't actually seen the exhibit.\n \nThey also make her appear more upright than I believe she was.\nThen you \"believe\" she was? Based on your studies of vertebrate anatomy, or on your belief in mythology? Please discuss the knees, head of the femur, pelvis, sacrum and lower spine, and the foramen magnum in support of your belief. Are you not aware that the representation of what Lucy probably looked like is constructed from the fossils of more than 300 individuals of Lucy's species? I didn't think so.\n \nI believe Lucy was just another species of Ape, Monkey or Chimp that went extinct due to either a change in her ecosystem, environment or as part of the food chain by a more powerful animal of the period.\nGreat. You can believe that if you want, just as you can believe that it is all magic and that there was a global flood. That doesn't actually have any meaning without evidence. In fact, just as modern humans are apes by definition, Lucy was an ape. However, she and her species were neither chimps or monkeys.\n \nThat their is no real evidence to assume that she was as hairless as she was as we have no flesh samples to confirm the size of her pores. But that doesn't stop evo from making these huge assumptions and presenting them as facts by making life size Lucy's in living color that contain these features that promote their \"PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS\".\nWhat have you been reading? Lucy isn't presented as hairless. Moreover, any fool who knows anything is aware that her quite hairy representation is just speculation. Why would anyone assume that the size of Lucy's pores is not similar to that of humans and chimps? And it seems to me that you are the one with preconceived notions that seem to come from the mythology of bronze age, nomadic herdsmen.\n \nAnother problem I have that feeds this preconceived notion assertion is the mislabeling of these allegedly ancient fossils by referring to them as Java MAN, Peking MAN, Neanderthal MAN when they weren't absolutely, necessarily men at all, but simply primates that are assumed once again, to be related to us.\nBut would you understand what I was talking about if I referred to AL 288-1, Trinil 2, Sangiran 17, KNM-ER 1813, OH 13, KNM-WT 15000, or Saccopastore 1? You know so little that you don't even realize that the names to which you object are not scientific names but names popularized by the press for people, like you, who know so little about it. Scientifically, both Java Man and Peking Man are Homo erectus. They are classified as such because there are no significant differences between them. In fact, there is little difference between Java Man (Trinil 2) and the skull of Nariokotome Boy (KNM-WT 15000), from Africa, or KNM-ER 3733 for that matter.\n \n But you are obsessed with the words. You are so bent out of shape because transitional species between ape-like ancestors and us, that walked upright and used tools are called \"man\". And they aren't assumed to be ancestral. Why don't you learn what you are talking about before you speak. You make yourself look foolish when you speak from ignorance.\n ]quote]Regarding the Java Man, How is this skull cap evidence of anything concrete?[/quote]How is it that you think that evidence against your mythology based point of view supports your mythology?\n \nAccording to this source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Man The brain size of Java was larger than the largest modern Ape at about 950 Grams. But the human adult brain is 1300 to 1400 Grams. And notice the slope and brow of this animal. By what standard of evidence can we say with any assurance that this is definitely a precursor of what is today the Homo Sapien?\nThat's Homo sapiens. You reveal your lack of knowledge. But I've never seen anyone claim that Java Man was a precursor of H. sapiens. What does that mean? What is claimed is that Java Man, along with all of the other examples of Homo erectus are examples of transitional species predicted by the theories of evolution. In fact, current theory is that the Asian H. erectus is not ancestral to modern humans. Modern humans arose in Africa and replaced other species of Homo (H. erectus, H. neanderthalensis) as a result of a second emigration from Africa.\n \nThe strata is another real problem for evolution, because we all know that some fossils that are presumed to be from millions to hundreds of millions of years old have been found on or near the surface of the Earth.\nDo you know what erosion is? I am at a loss as to how I can characterize your statement without seeming to insult. Your claim is mindless at best. Why not try to learn before you speak?\n \nWe have also found specimens of T-Rex that has been dated to 60 million years old recently with soft tissue intact that was so pristine that they hope to get a complete DNA sample from it, and in fact may have by now.\nYou are a dupe. There is not dinosaur fossil that has ever been found that is only 60 million years old. The fossil in question was 70 million years old. But, of course, one expects such error from those who are ignorant of the facts.\n \n In fact, no one ever hoped to get a complete DNA sample from it. That is a lie. It wasn't pristine by any means. It was what appear to be some protein remnants.\n \nThis discovery defies common sense and breaks so many other accepted facts as to leave one incredulous.\nThat is true if you are a scientifically illiterate creationist. Otherwise, not.\n \nScience has accepted that the minerals found in the Earth such as lime and natural acids will corrode wood, metals, fabrics if kept buried for just Centuries, much less hundreds of millions of years.\n### are you talking about? How is that relevant?\n \nAnd yet evolutionists will proudly announce the discovery of a 65 million year old T-Rex containing soft tissue and expect skeptics to receive that as proof that evolution is based on facts and common sense?\nMake up your mind. Was it a 60 million year old fossil of a 65 million year old fossil. Ah ha! It was neither! Put on your dunce cap and sit in the corner.\n \nIt is much more reasonable at face value that T-Rex walked the Earth much more recently than previously believed and that our dating methods are in need of reconsideration.\nWhy is that much more reasonable? Do you have a degree in nuclear physics that allows you to make such a judgement? Please, explain why our dating methods need reconsideration. Please present your academic qualifications to make such judgements. I'm looking forward to it. While I have not formally studied nuclear physics, I have done extensive reading on the subject. And what I don't understand about radiometric dating, I can always ask my son, who did, in fact, study nuclear physics.\n \nHere is one explanation of how evolutionists explain the inconsistencies found in Strata layers and again it assumes much in order to make the pieces fit as they need them to fit in order for evo to remain a rational science as they see it.\nWhy is it that you think that geology is somehow evolutionary biology? Do you ever actually learn before speaking?\n \nSo you see, at every single aspect, angle, level and particular belief regarding the so called science of evolution, the proponents must take the existing undeniable and irrefutable facts, such as the existing strata and then come up with new theories to explain why reality contradicts the preconceived notions that is Evolution.\nWho told you that. Why do you have the preconceived notion that the mythology of bronze age, nomadic herdsmen is true? Why not offer some evidence to support you mythology. I guess there isn't any.",

   "I'm going to have to take this piecemeal too. Never enough time!\n \n True, of course, and inevitable as I'm sure you'd agree. Nevertheless, these variably incomplete fossils do exhibit that which is predicted by evolutionary theory: a blend or mixture of characteristics which trends towards the morphology of modern humans in progressively more recent strata.\n \n What you might be overlooking is that the inference of a close relationship to human ancestry of these fossils is drawn not only from their correlation with evolutionary theory, but from the correlation of all fossils with evolutionary theory. Do you appreciate the logic here? If 'transitional' hominid fossils were the only ones found, and all others were an unordered hodgepodge that contradicted common descent, a case could be that the apparent hominid 'transition' is a fluke. It would be the exception to the rule. But that is not the case. All fossils thus far recovered correlate with common descent - so what grounds do you have for making an exceptional interpretation of the hominid fossil evidence?\n\n \n \n Hi Peeling, I really understand the point you're making regarding the alleged genetic/biological kinship between these fossils and homo sapien. But let me make a suggestion that could possibly throw a wrench in your theory, completely nullifying it as a rational consideration to explain our origins.\n \n What if, just as the modern day chimp carries 98% of the human genetic code, and yet is visibly a lower animal on all levels of comparison, so has every primate that has ever existed shared certain genetic markers simply because they were also primates. Therefore, the science that shows these genetic markers exist isn't faulty at all, but the interpretation of the scientists that ASSUMES we must be related as direct evolutionary descendants is completely flawed at every level of rationality. \n \n Especially since God has preserved the Chimp from extinction so that we can observe first hand a creature that shares a full 98% of our modern genetic code yet is most assuredly a lower animal. \n \n \nShould the first bolded part have been more like the second, or do you have some evidence to back you up? :)\n\n \n I need to point out that I used Lucy only as ONE example of the creative license this so called science that asserts that it only report and publishes facts and known information will participate in when in fact it has no such evidence at all that Lucy could have even survived had she so little fur as they imply. Just as referring to the Java, Peking and Neanderthal fossils as MEN is exercising creative license but nothing that has been proven with confirmed evidence in any way. \n \n \nAnd you're perfectly entitled to believe that, so long as you understand that doing so entails believing that this seperate species, which you claim lived alongside chimps and humans from the very beginning, just happened to leave a fossil in precisely the right stratum to make it look transitional. Just like all the other hominid fossils.\n\n \n That remains to be proven my friend. I posted solid evidence yesterday of Earth stratums that are completely reversed from how they should be with no evidence of volcanic upheaval and strangely, you completely ignored it. Here it is again for your consideration. http://www.rae.org/revev2.html And I repost it as absolute proof of nothing but as just an example of how evolutionary science makes more unsubstantiated claims without letting the actual facts of where fossils are found to get in their way at all.\n \n \nAre you starting to see my point yet? You're trying to claim that because Lucy isn't conclusive proof, she means nothing. That's fallacious reasoning: Lucy contributes to the accumulated evidence supporting common descent.\n \n \n No Peeling, Lucy is just one other example of the inconsistency of evo, not the only one.\n \n I Will answer the rest of the post on a new page.",

   "I don't find Lucy's bones, in isolation, to be convincing evidence of common chimp/human ancestry. Even their discovery in just the right stratum isn't on its own completely convincing - it could be a fluke. But how many such flukes can one plausibly hypothesise? All the hundreds of other Australopithecus afarensis fossils dug up, for instance - surely some of them ought to have been found in anomalous strata if they had really coexisted with all other species from the beginning.\n \n Hairless or hairy - I don't see how even a speculative artist's impression invalidates the actual fossil evidence. \n \n \n \n As opposed to primates that, once again by pure fluke, just happened to only ever leave fossils in just the right strata to appear transitional.\n\n \n You have repeatedly alleged that ALL of these fossils have ALWAYS been found at just the right stratum implying that it is absolute evidence of the accuracy of evo's findings and conclusions. I challenge you to offer 2 links with two cut and paste quotes of any two scientific sources that both claim that every single fossil ever found to contribute to the theory has been found at precisely the right strata that coincides with its alleged age.\n \n \nWe can't, of course, and nobody does. The likelihood of finding a direct ancestor's remains is very small and the possibility of confirming such a relationship nonexistent. Java man, like all other fossils, is most likely a cousin to our great-to-the-nth-grandfather. Does that disqualify him from being a hominid? Of course not - if your mother's sister dies without issue, she still counts as human even though she will not be ancestral to any later humans.\n\n \n What you have said here directly supports my contention on the post above that asserts that just because we have a genetic relationship with other Primates that have existed in the past, does not mean at all that they we are descended from them or that they are in any way direct ancestors of ours. The chimp after all is a contemporary animal that shares the modern World with us, which is no way like us, but because it also shares 98% of our genetic code are you saying that it is directly related to us through Random Mutation, Natural Selection or the evolutionary process at all? I hope not, because that would completely nullify every other aspect of what evolution claims to be true.\n \n So how do you marry these blatant and obvious contradictions and mixed messages within the Genetic Code? It seems very presumptuous that given the current living evidence we have in the chimp that we can just assume that any similarities in ancient primate fossils to our genetic code means an obvious ancestry or kinship.",

   "But let's reverse your scenario and see if it is consistent when animals are placed with humans? Does the dog, which has been domesticated for centuries now, when adopted by a family as a puppy, adapt to its humans and learn how to be as humans are because of their closeness to us?\n\n No - but then the feral child illustration was intended to highlight the significance of human social 'DNA' to humans, not to imply that it can civilize any old species.\n \n However, you raise a good point which I can turn to my advantage: let's replace the dogs in your reversed scenario with, say, chimps. Can they learn table manners and use silverware, learn to use the toilet or bathe themselves? Yes. I've seen a bonobo prepare a boil-in-the-bag meal. I consider my point concerning the role of social DNA in distinguishing human from animal pretty much made :) \n \nEvolution not only implies that we evolved from lower life forms but learned, created new technologies and remembered what we learned in ways that allowed us to pass them along to future generations that improved upon them and sent us forward to the level we're at today.\n\n All of which behaviour chimps and other animals also exhibit - they're just not as good at it as we are. In their environment, the selective pressure favouring intelligence has not thus far pushed primate intellect to the critical mass it reached in our ancestors. And unless some catastrophe befalls mankind, they're never going to get a chance to inhabit environments that do kickstart that engine, because we're already there, and we don't take kindly to intruders.\n \n \nThe big question for me remains why only Man has learned and evolved the higher brain functions of creativity, long term memory, and imagination beyond the limitations of what is based on inherited instincts as animals are so limited by.\n\n Sure, we do those things best, but it's by no means all-or-nothing. Observe the difficulty we have in returning hand-reared animals to the wild - that alone proves that at least some of the behaviour that keeps them alive is not an 'inherited instinct' but is passed down in their own social DNA - which logically means that that behaviour must at some point have been invented, imagined, refined.\n \nIf you took a human being today and dropped him in a forest or jungle, he would immediately look for a sharp rock to cut wood with, and after making a shelter he would find a flint and stone to start a fire with. Once he accomplished the basics, he would make a weapon and hunt for meat.\n\n And he would do all these things because he had watched the Discovery channel, not because he is inherently bright enough to deduce from first principles that flint and stone make sparks, that dried vegetation can be burned, why burning vegetation might be a good idea or that fire even exists. You are gifting your human with a huge quantity of social DNA that billions have lived and died to accumulate.\n \n \nOf course not. Not in a million or a hundred million years which is evidenced by the fact that we alone stand at the pinnacle of life on Earth as the only creatures who learn and improve from ONE generation to the next.\n\n As I showed above, we are merely the best, not the only species capable of it. And it's yet to be proved to be a long-term survival strategy :)\n \n More seriously, what you're saying highlights a trend I've noticed in all doubters of evolution: a tendency to unconsciously hold too many things constant. You confidently assert that a chimp would never in a hundred million years achieve what we have, and you're right, of course - but only by virtue of mentally holding the 'chimp' phenotype and their environment constant throughout those aeons. Since there's no evidence of that in the past, why assume it will remain so in the future?\n \nThe lower primates wont even observe my creativity and understand that it will make their lives easier too. Yet according to evo we all climbed out of the same exact puddle of primordial ooze at the same exact time, so we have had the same amount of time to adapt and evolve to the World around us. Yet only Man has accomplished such forward thinking capabilities.\n\n Evolutionary theory does not say chimps and humans emerged from primordial ooze at the same time, or indeed at all. The evidence is that it took two billion years or so for life to reach the cellular level. No chimps, no humans, no 'cells destined to be chimps' and 'cells destined to be humans', just cells. Then another half-billion years for colonial structures and the earliest differentiated colonies to form. Still no chimps or humans. You seem to have a vision of an evolutionary footrace between chimps and humans from the very start - before anything had even evolved feet. It's just not the right image to hold at all. And as for adapting to the world around us - you're making the 'holding things constant' mistake again. To a large extent other creatures, of other species and our own, are the world around us, and it is them we adapt to. We all push each other onward. \n \n Where the 'footrace' you're picturing does start is about ten million years ago. If you're now picturing stupid hairy humans living alongside apes, you still haven't got the idea. Picture instead a single ape species, some of which migrate into a different environment - the jungle fringes, perhaps, or the sea shore. Or perhaps that new environment is forced upon them by the long-cycle deforestation of Africa. Either way, the jungle niche is still there, still viable, still inhabited, and the ape-ancestors who remain in that niche continue to evolve within it, alongside all the other species who inhabit it. Simple geographical seperation is enough to allow speciation to begin, with the gene pools of the jungle-apes and the hypothetical 'shore apes' intermingled less and less.\n \n It is a mistake to assume that intelligence is under all circumstances a good thing. It may not be any help at all. It's costly, too - about 25% of the energy we derive from food goes toward powering our brains, far more than any other creature. If additional energy expenditure on brain power does not reap commensurate rewards, it will be selected against. The apes who are now chimps live in an environment that leaves them, along with all other species, on the far side of a kind of intellectual 'speed bump', where an impossibly big one-step increase in intelligence would ultimately be beneficial but an attainable, small, evolutionary increase, coming as it does at the expense of additional energy expenditure, is not. \n \n When you think about evolution, you think it claims that somehow we, and only we, leaped over that speed bump, and you are skeptical. How can our ancestors be both animals like any other and yet at the same time be special enough to make such a unique foray into enlightenment?\n \n The answer is that we didn't hurdle that speed bump: our ancestors were those apes who happened to find an environment where it wasn't in the way.\n \n Time's up for today, I'll return to your third reply tomorrow.",

And please don't try to support your argument by relying on semantics such as the definition of primate and monkey. The point is that chimps exist today and have PROVEN with science to share 98% of human DNA. By all the claims of evolution, they should be more like us than like animals. But we know that the 2% that they aren't like us must be huge and determines what separates them from us.\n \n So how you can look at vague similarities and genetic markers in long deal primates and infer that they are ancestors of human beings is not only ludicrous but unprovable.\n \n \nTo say that chimps and humans are both primates is to say that we're closely related; that's what the term means.

In all areas of comparison chimps resemble precisely what and where evolution claims humanity was at our infancy on that evolutionary ladder. \n \n So why didn't we replace the chimp by out hunting and out evolving them?

   "\n Here is one explanation of how evolutionists explain the inconsistencies found in Strata layers and again it assumes much in order to make the pieces fit as they need them to fit in order for evo to remain a rational science as they see it.\n http://www.rae.org/revev2.html\n EXPECTED\n \n Cretaceous \n Jurassic \n Triassic \n Permian Pennsylvanian Mississippian Devonian \n Silurian \n Ordovician \n Cambrian Precambrian\n \n ACTUAL\n \n Precambrian Cretaceous\n \n The Lewis Overthrust\n \n First identified by Willis in 1901, this area encompassing Glacier National Park is more than 300 miles long and 15#50 miles wide, with Precambrian strata resting on top of Cretaceous.1 The fossils are in the wrong order. Evolutionists date the Precambrian rock at a billion years; the Cretaceous at 150 million years. The contact line between the two different strata is like a knife-edge, suggesting that instead of an overthrust, the strata were water-deposited in that order. This contact line can be clearly seen at Chief Mountain, with the older strata resting directly on top of the younger.2\n \n Since evolutionists suppose the Precambrian era to be the age before life evolved, and the Cretaceous period to be the age of the dinosaurs, the entire evolutionary time scale is at stake. The idea that such a large section of the Rocky Mountains uplifted and slid twelve to fifty miles to the east without leaving any evidence of movement is incredible. It is more reasonable to believe that the geological time scale is in error.\n \n Evolutionists have proposed two theories, one that a massive fold got started in the earth's crust, sheared, and forced to the east3, the other that the block of strata slid down a slope.4 The biggest problem with both theories is the size of the rock sheet. In order for an overthrust of the entire geologic column to occur, the original rock sheet would have been three miles high. A three-mile high, 12,000 square mile rock sheet doesn't tend to slide anywhere or overturn easily. The forces required to move it would have exceeded the crushing strength of the rock.\n \n We investigated the Lewis Overthrust with creation geologist Michael Oard in August 2002. He showed us the contact at Marias Pass from a distance, and you can get a perspective of the magnitude of the problem. Near Trick Falls at the Two Medicine campground, we hiked to an area where a flood in 1964 exposed the contact. Michael showed us a Ph.D. thesis that was written about this area, and the researcher puzzled over the problem that the slickensides were 90 degrees from the expected direction of the rock movement, and the integrity of the underlying strata does not justify an overthrust of the magnitude expected.\n So you see, at every single aspect, angle, level and particular belief regarding the so called science of evolution, the proponents must take the existing undeniable and irrefutable facts, such as the existing strata and then come up with new theories to explain why reality contradicts the preconceived notions that is Evolution.\n\n \n I'm hoping someone will address this.\n \n Geology 101.\n \n Waxy",

Philadelphia, PA: Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co., pp. 185-195.\n Response:\n \n 1. Contrary to the claim, geologists do find convincing evidence of a thrust fault between the strata (Strahler 1987, chap. 40). This is true even of young-earth creationists with geology training. For example, Kurt Wise (1986, 136) said that \"[a] close examination of the contact between the Cretaceous and Precambrian rocks leaves no doubt that the contact is a fault contact.\"\n \n 2. The strata on either side of the discontinuity are well ordered and have the order one would expect from a thrust fault.\n \n 3. The photo in Whitcomb and Morris's (1961) book The Genesis Flood showing the \"Lewis Overthrust contact line\" (Figure 17, p. 190) is not really a photo of the contact line, but of rocks 200 feet above it. The photographs that Whitcomb and Morris used were taken by Walter Lammerts, a botanist and geneticist, on his vacation (Numbers 1992, 216-219).\n \n 4. Whitcomb and Morris (1961, 187) quoted a description of the Lewis Overthrust out of context to give the impression that rocks along the fault are undisturbed. They quoted Ross and Rezak (1959),\n \n Most visitors, especially those who stay on the roads, get the impression that the Belt strata are undisturbed and lie almost as flat today as they did when deposited in the sea which vanished so many [million] years ago. \n \n Whitcomb and Morris silently omit the word \"million,\" and the original paper (Ross and Rezak 1959, 420) continues:\n \n Actually, they are folded, and in certain zones they are intensely so. From points on and near the trails in the park it is possible to observe places where the beds of the Belt series, as revealed in outcrops on ridges, cliffs, and canyon walls, are folded and crumpled almost as intricately as the soft younger strata in the mountains south of the park and in the Great Plains adjoining the park to the east. \n\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD102_1.html\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/lewis-overthrust.html",

   "For someone who claims that we distort, fabricate and lie about what you said, you sure don't have an problem doing the exact same about what we say.\n \n Peeling said nothing about all fossils being found in the correct layer. You are asserting that such is true and putting words in his mouth and expecting him to back up what amounts to your argument.\n \n How is that honest?\n\n \n The only person being dishonest around here is you. Need I post every single time he made that claim in this thread for you to take responsibility for the claim being made? And why are you commenting on a thread you obviously haven't read if you're denying what is written clearly for all to see?\n \n Why must you people come to threads I'm on and derail them with ridiculous minutia rather than actually deal with the debate that is being argued? I'll tell you why. Because you know that the living chimpanzee that shares 98% of our genetic code, and is living evidence that such shared DNA is in no way evidence of human descent at all completely nullifies and negates all of the claims made by evolutionists that these genetic markers in long dead animals could possibly ever be proven to be our ancestors. It is common sense evidence of the delusions of the secular humanist to insist that evo is anything more than wishful thinking.\n \n That is why you will all derail the thread with stupid attacks rather than even try to deal with the points I've raised that you can't answer. So here are five quotes of Peeling making the same basic claim in our short debate together which is why I asked for this evidence to support his claims. \n \n [QUOTE=Archangel] \n You have repeatedly alleged that ALL of these fossils have ALWAYS been found at just the right stratum implying that it is absolute evidence of the accuracy of evo's findings and conclusions. I challenge you to offer 2 links with two cut and paste quotes of any two scientific sources that both claim that every single fossil ever found to contribute to the theory has been found at precisely the right strata that coincides with its alleged age.[QUOTE]\n \n [QUOTE=Peeling: OP]The ToE makes specific predictions: transitional fossils must only ever be found in strata older than that in which fossils of daughter species are found. [QUOTE]\n \n [QUOTE=Peeling;301446] Nevertheless, these variably incomplete fossils do exhibit that which is predicted by evolutionary theory: a blend or mixture of characteristics which trends towards the morphology of modern humans in progressively more recent strata.[QUOTE]\n \n [QUOTE=Peeling]And you're perfectly entitled to believe that, so long as you understand that doing so entails believing that this seperate species, which you claim lived alongside chimps and humans from the very beginning, just happened to leave a fossil in precisely the right stratum to make it look transitional. Just like all the other hominid fossils. [QUOTE]\n \n [QUOTE=Peeling]I don't find Lucy's bones, in isolation, to be convincing evidence of common chimp/human ancestry. Even their discovery in just the right stratum isn't on its own completely convincing - it could be a fluke. But how many such flukes can one plausibly hypothesise? All the hundreds of other Australopithecus afarensis fossils dug up, for instance - surely some of them ought to have been found in anomalous strata if they had really coexisted with all other species from the beginning.[QUOTE]\n \n \n [QUOTE=Peeling]As opposed to primates that, once again by pure fluke, just happened to only ever leave fossils in just the right strata to appear transitional.[QUOTE]",

Here, check out the link again, it has graphs and drawings for you.\n \n http://www.rae.org/revev2.html\n The Lewis Overthrust\n \n First identified by Willis in 1901, this area encompassing Glacier National Park is more than 300 miles long and 15#50 miles wide, with Precambrian strata resting on top of Cretaceous.1 The fossils are in the wrong order. Evolutionists date the Precambrian rock at a billion years; the Cretaceous at 150 million years. The contact line between the two different strata is like a knife-edge, suggesting that instead of an overthrust, the strata were water-deposited in that order. This contact line can be clearly seen at Chief Mountain, with the older strata resting directly on top of the younger.2\n \n Since evolutionists suppose the Precambrian era to be the age before life evolved, and the Cretaceous period to be the age of the dinosaurs, the entire evolutionary time scale is at stake. The idea that such a large section of the Rocky Mountains uplifted and slid twelve to fifty miles to the east without leaving any evidence of movement is incredible. It is more reasonable to believe that the geological time scale is in error.\n \n Evolutionists have proposed two theories, one that a massive fold got started in the earth's crust, sheared, and forced to the east3, the other that the block of strata slid down a slope.4   The biggest problem with both theories is the size of the rock sheet. In order for an overthrust of the entire geologic column to occur, the original rock sheet would have been three miles high. A three-mile high, 12,000 square mile rock sheet doesn't tend to slide anywhere or overturn easily. The forces required to move it would have exceeded the crushing strength of the rock.  ",

It is because all fossils of Australopithecus afarensis have been found in equatorial Africa, in a quite limited area in the Great Rift Valley, limited to the Afar region of Ethiopia, the Olduvai Gorge, and Laetoli in Tanzania. Why do you believe that A. afarensis had a broader distribution. After all, Lucy's kind aren't like Homo erectus, with examples in Africa, Turkey, Georgia, India, Viet Nam, Indonesia, and China. Please cite the evidence for a wider distribution of A. afarensis.\n \nAnd why do you assume that fur is designed to protect only from the cold?\nBut I didn't. I was responding to you narrow minded and uneducated implication that it was true.\n \nDon't you know that modern day animals that live in warm climates are protected from the Sun by their fur? And it helps regulate their body temp?\nIn fact, I am well aware of that. But you don't seem to be aware that none of them are bipedal and none of them sweat. And, of course, humans live in equitorial Africa and South America without much body hair and without clothes. Perhaps you are unaware of the fact that humans also have lived at the southern tip of South America and didn't wear clothes. But they survived without fur. But then, your education seems to be quite limited.\n \nGee pandion, I gave you credit for being more intelligent than that but obviously I was wrong about you.

You may just want to excuse and dismiss it as no big deal but they are a scientifically accepted label placed on these creatures in every text book that our children learn from.\nReally?

   "Out of the various issues at stake, AA, I find your take on our genetic similarity with chimps to be the most interesting. The idea that genetic similarity could be indicative of an absence of shared ancestry is fascinating.\n \n However, I appreciate that you've got your teeth into the fossil record topic, so we can continue there if you like. First, I'd better apologise for the lack of clarity and sloppy wording on my part that has led to the wrangling over what was said regarding the strata in which fossils are found.\n \n My OP stated my understanding most clearly, I think: all fossils ever found have fitted the ToE's predictions. But remember that the ToE does not predict a specific tree of life, only that it be a tree. To be strictly accurate hybridisation of closely related species (eg horses and donkeys producing mules) can distort the tree-structure's fine detail a little, but on the whole it hold true, and as you can appreciate, usually-infertile hybrids like mules don't contribute much to the later structure.\n \n The salient point to take from here is that if in reality all species were created seperately and simultaneously, the odds against us observing a fossil record (and for that matter, a pattern and distribution of extant species) congruent with common descent purely by chance are beyond astronomical. Common descent is the only hypothesis, the only explanation, that says the odds are good that we will find what we have found. Do you understand that reasoning?\n \n Your competing hypothesis is that every fossil found represents an extinct species (very likely true) unrelated to any other and having existed side-by-side with all other species since the dawn of time. The italicised part is the important bit. If that were true, we ought to find more and more fossils of more and more kinds, modern ones included, the deeper we look, as we effectively rewind the pattern of extinction. The bottom-most layers should yield dead hominids of all kinds alongside dinosaurs and trilobites. That's what your hypothesis predicts, but it's not what we see.\n \n Remember: you said that you were prepared to accept for the sake of argument that dating methods were as accurate as they claim to be, but that even then the fossil record was not indicative of common descent. So without calling into question the dating methods, can you account for the vast discrepancy between what your hypothesis predicts and what we actually see? I'm not trying to trap you - if it is the dating issue that causes you problems, we can talk about it. I just want to be clear about what it is you disagree with. If you think common descent is a reasonable interpretation of the evidence assuming dating methods are as accurate as they claim, we can move on to talk about dating methods. If on the other hand you think simultaneous creation is a reasonable interpretation of the same evidence given the same dating accuracy assumption, we need to talk about that first.\n \n Regarding what I've said about hominid fossils, it was hasty, sloppy, and flat-out wrong of me to use phrases like 'just the right stratum'. What I was trying to do was tag on the appropriate rider to your beliefs regarding fossil hominids: if you believe they were not related to us and instead lived alongside us from the dawn of time, you must also believe that they, and we, managed to only ever leave fossils in strata consistent with an interpretation of common descent completely by chance. Why no sapiens fossils in or below the same strata as habilis? Why no habilis fossils in or below the same strata as Tyrannosaurus? If we've all been around from the beginning, why do we look like such late arrivals to the party?\n \n Let me quote you something from TO, regarding human ancestry:\n \nThere are a number of clear trends (which were neither continuous nor uniform) from early australopithecines to recent humans: increasing brain size, increasing body size, increasing use of and sophistication in tools, decreasing tooth size, decreasing skeletal robustness. There are no clear dividing lines between some of the later gracile australopithecines and some of the early Homo, between erectus and archaic sapiens, or archaic sapiens and modern sapiens.\n \n Despite this, there is little consensus on what our family tree is. Everyone accepts that the robust australopithecines (aethiopicus, robustus and boisei) are not ancestral to us, being a side branch that left no descendants. Whether H. habilis is descended from A. afarensis, africanus, both of them, or neither of them, is still a matter of debate. It is possible that none of the known australopithecines is our ancestor.\n \n A number of new genera and species have been discovered within the last decade (Ar. ramidus, Au. amanensis, Au. bahrelghazali, Au. garhi, Orrorin, Kenyanthropus, Sahelanthropus) and no consensus has yet formed on how they are related to each other or to humans. It is generally accepted that Homo erectus is descended from Homo habilis (or, at least, some of the fossils often assigned to habilis), but the relationship between erectus, sapiens and the Neandertals is still unclear. Neandertal affinities can be detected in some specimens of both archaic and modern sapiens.\n\n As I've said several times, no scientist is claiming that these fossils represent ancestral forms of humans. The interpretation that they are related to us - that we and they share a common ancestor, that we are twigs from the same branch, derives from the fact that it is the only plausible explanation for their existence and the fossil evidence they have left behind.",

And because child insisted that you never made the claim, I posted 5 different times that you stated clearly that the depth that fossils are found at lines up perfectly with where they should be found to support your faith in evolution. I insisted, and maintain my insistence that no such evidence exists because the depth fossils used are found at is secondary to the perceived evidence it adds to the fossil record. \n \n In other words, a fossil found on the surface, or 3 feet under the surface is still dated at 3 million years old if that is where it appears to best fit into the fossil record based on the preconceived notions of the so called scientists making the discovery.

If I search through different evolutionary science communities, I can find numerous different Trees of Life that imply the same basic things but all have different branches in different places on the tree. In other words, even evo doesn't agree, nor is it on the same page regarding the science it claims is so true and reliable. Debating with an evolutionist is like debating with oil as it squirms, slips and just slides away in another direction from any evidence that shows how unreliable it is.\n \n http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Phylogenetic_tree.svg/800px-Phylogenetic_tree.svg.png\n \n http://www.tolweb.org/tree/img/toloverview.jpg\n \n \nThe salient point to take from here is that if in reality all species were created seperately and simultaneously, the odds against us observing a fossil record (and for that matter, a pattern and distribution of extant species) congruent with common descent purely by chance are beyond astronomical.

Do you understand that reasoning?\n\n \n This is another huge assumption on your part Peeling. And the largest assumption is that the dating methods evo relies on are perfectly accurate which you know I reject out of hand. And also, It assumes that every life form is represented and has been discovered at every strata looked at since life began on Earth, and it also assumes that Creationists don't accept that changes in animals do take place from generation to generation based on environmental pressures. It is Rapid Adaptation that occurs naturally in Nature, not evolution. \n \n \nYour competing hypothesis is that every fossil found represents an extinct species (very likely true) unrelated to any other and having existed side-by-side with all other species since the dawn of time.

The bible records animals co-existing with humans that can only be described as Dinosaurs. Now the question is, if Dinos in fact were extinct for 60 million years, then how did primitive man have the knowledge necessary to describe them 5,000 years ago?

   "Now I know you never read any links given to you so I'm going to post part of why the behemoth can't be an dinosaur:\n \n \nWhy Behemoth Is Not A Dinosaur\n \n No matter how many times they insist on him being a dinosaur, Behemoth is still not a dinosaur. Here is the factual reason to why it is so.\n \n According to the passage, Behemoth is said to eat grass like an ox. Although, nowadays, it is known that some sauropods like Diplodocus have horizontal necks that can easily reach the ground for ferns to eat, sauropods, unlike cows, completely lack chewing teeth. They cannot chew their food at all. Their jaws can only move up and down like the jaws of a crocodile, not in a circular pattern like the jaws of a cow. Instead, they had to swallow stones that traveled through the necks and into the gizzard area. There, the stones help to grind their food by mashing plant matter into a digestable pulp with the help of special muscles found inside of the gizzards.\n \n Believe it or not there were grass growing at the time of the dinosaurs. Once thought to first appeared around 40 million years ago, grass is now known to begin to grow in the late Cretaceous period at the very end of the dinosaur age. Grass must have evolved as method of defense against the marauding chewing jaws of dinosaurs like Homalocephale and Edmontosaurus simply by having the ability to grow fast and have very tough fibers that made things difficult for an animals to digest it without having an adequate digestive system like what cows and horses have. Thus, dinosaurs, at that time, took advantage of this new food source and begin eating it just like what a Titanosaur had done 65 million years ago, then took a dump and left a pile on the ground that eventually became a coprolite fossil that is recently unearthed by scientists who were caught off guard when they first look at the fossil up close and saw remnants of grass blades found inside of it. The fossil dung is dated back between 70 and 65 million years ago and the grass inside of it was eaten by Titanosaurids that deposit this dung from their bodies awhile after they ate the grass, which likely explains why do they along with the Hadrosaurs have broad mouths. Although, it is now known that there were grass growing at the time of the dinosaurs as depicted in Rudolph Zallinger's dinopaintings, this does not serve as a justification of Behemoth being a sauropod dinosaur due to the dinosaur's lack of chewing teeth as described above. \n",

   "It's not only fascinating, it's the bullet that kills evolutions claim that similar genetic markers in these ancient primates is evidence that we are related to them in any way. The claim is confidently made yet the assertion is impossible to prove.\n\n Well, we can return to that later; I look forward to it.\n \nIn other words, a fossil found on the surface, or 3 feet under the surface is still dated at 3 million years old if that is where it appears to best fit into the fossil record based on the preconceived notions of the so called scientists making the discovery.\n\n This particular misunderstanding is probably my fault again; I habitually use 'depth' when referring to strata, which is misleading. Ancient strata are exposed via processes like erosion, and their age is established via several independent methods before a new fossil can be dated - but again, we're veering off into a discussion of dating methods. You've said that a common-descent interpretation of the fossil evidence would be erroneous even if the dating of these fossils was as accurate as scientists claim. Like I said before, if dating is the only issue, and you're happy to agree that common descent is the most plausible interpretation assuming the dating is accurate, we can move on.\n \nYou have just revealed another problem with evolution Peeling. If I search through different evolutionary science communities, I can find numerous different Trees of Life that imply the same basic things but all have different branches in different places on the tree.\n\n If you check back to my first post, you'll notice that I explicitly made this point already, up front: the ToE predicts a tree of life - not one specific tree of life. Yes, there are competing hypotheses for what the actual tree of life looks like, because when and where particular branches occurred is not explicitly delineated by the fossil evidence. Scientists have to make an educated guess taking other factors into account, and opinions can differ.\n \n However, the evidence we have still describes a tree, and not in any way the simultaneous creation hypothesis you favour.\n \nThis is another huge assumption on your part Peeling. And the largest assumption is that the dating methods evo relies on are perfectly accurate which you know I reject out of hand.\n\n Not here you don't; you agreed to temporarily suspend that disbelief and explain your other reasons for believing fossil evidence supports simultaneous creation. If you don't have any, we can move on to discuss dating methods.\n \nThis also is an assumption made by evo Peeling. The bible records animals co-existing with humans that can only be described as Dinosaurs. Now the question is, if Dinos in fact were extinct for 60 million years, then how did primitive man have the knowledge necessary to describe them 5,000 years ago? Here's one example.\n\n If you visit Longleat House near Bath, England, they have on display an ancient illustrated copy of the bible, which happens to be open at a page depicting a hippopotamus, with the legend 'BEHEMOTH' written below it. What you quote sounds like a perfect description of that animal, right down to the wild animals drinking at the water's edge while the hippos submerge themselves.\n \n That's beside the point, though. We're looking at fossil evidence. Ambiguous and hyperbolic descriptions of animals in the bible do not make up for the clear and unambiguous pattern of fossils.\n \n I know there's a lot of ground to cover and I'm sorry to keep reining this debate in, but you were very specific. You said that even if all fossils were dated correctly, it would still be wrong of scientists to infer common descent rather than simultaneous creation. All I'm after is some justification for that claim. Do you really believe it's pure chance that we don't find hominid fossils alongside (and by alongside, I mean within a few million years of) dinosaurs, or dinosaurs alongside trilobites? Do you believe it's pure chance that when we use genetic clocks and our strata dating methods to predict where we ought to look to find hippo/whale ancestor fossils, or sea-to-land transitional form fossils, we find those fossils?\n \n Or would you agree that if fossils have been dated correctly, it looks very much like the modern human form has existed for comparatively little of history, and that it appears to have emerged toward the end of a ten-million year period in which progressively more human-like hominids appeared and became extinct?",

Because you know that the living chimpanzee that shares 98% of our genetic code, and is living evidence that such shared DNA is in no way evidence of human descent at all completely nullifies and negates all of the claims made by evolutionists that these genetic markers in long dead animals could possibly ever be proven to be our ancestors. It is common sense evidence of the delusions of the secular humanist to insist that evo is anything more than wishful thinking.\n \n That is why you will all derail the thread with stupid attacks rather than even try to deal with the points I've raised that you can't answer. So here are five quotes of Peeling making the same basic claim in our short debate together which is why I asked for this evidence to support his claims. \n \n \n \n You have repeatedly alleged that ALL of these fossils have ALWAYS been found at just the right stratum implying that it is absolute evidence of the accuracy of evo's findings and conclusions. I challenge you to offer 2 links with two cut and paste quotes of any two scientific sources that both claim that every single fossil ever found to contribute to the theory has been found at precisely the right strata that coincides with its alleged age.\n\n \n \nThe ToE makes specific predictions: transitional fossils must only ever be found in strata older than that in which fossils of daughter species are found. \n\n \n \n Nevertheless, these variably incomplete fossils do exhibit that which is predicted by evolutionary theory: a blend or mixture of characteristics which trends towards the morphology of modern humans in progressively more recent strata.\n\n \n \nAnd you're perfectly entitled to believe that, so long as you understand that doing so entails believing that this seperate species, which you claim lived alongside chimps and humans from the very beginning, just happened to leave a fossil in precisely the right stratum to make it look transitional. Just like all the other hominid fossils. \n\n \n \nI don't find Lucy's bones, in isolation, to be convincing evidence of common chimp/human ancestry. Even their discovery in just the right stratum isn't on its own completely convincing - it could be a fluke. But how many such flukes can one plausibly hypothesise? All the hundreds of other Australopithecus afarensis fossils dug up, for instance - surely some of them ought to have been found in anomalous strata if they had really coexisted with all other species from the beginning.\n\n \n \n \nAs opposed to primates that, once again by pure fluke, just happened to only ever leave fossils in just the right strata to appear transitional.\n\n \n \nAre you in complete denial of the truth or just blind child? You quoted parts of my post, here:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=301545&postcount=19\n \n Did you not notice the 5 times I quoted peeling stating clearly that the fossils are always found at the proper strata to support their age and place in the evolutionary scale? Is your tunnel vision so complete that you can just refuse to accept the evidence as you respond as if you're again right? When you couldn't be more wrong once again?\n \n And I notice that once again you have ignored the meat of my argument about the chimps DNA being evidence of why evos claims of Peking, Java and Neanderthal being ancestors to humans is so much wishful thinking with absolutely no hope of ever being proven considering that we have living contemporary animals that so closely resemble our genetic makeup. \n \n So get real child, stop playing games and deal honestly for once. And oh, by the way, admin asked me for recommendations for the new rule also, and I'm sure others also.\n\n \n \nAnd I challange you to find just one instance where he's ever claimed that ALL fossils have ALWAYS been found at precisely the right depth. And then link to it, of course. It will be amusing to see how you misinterpreted whatever was actually said.\n\n \n \nFor someone who claims that we distort, fabricate and lie about what you said, you sure don't have an problem doing the exact same about what we say.\n \n Peeling said nothing about all fossils being found in the correct layer. You are asserting that such is true and putting words in his mouth and expecting him to back up what amounts to your argument.\n \n How is that honest?\n\n So here is the complete diatribe of Kronus and child accusing me of being dishonest for accusing Peeling of repeatedly stating that fossils of the proper age are ALWAYS found at the right strata to confirm their place in the evolutionary chain. And below is childs claim that once again, I was unable to understand what he wrote. A direct lie and insult based on the obvious fact that I reproduced the quotes in a row for all to see, so I obviously understood what he said. And then he tried to say it was satire, which was also beyond my ability to comprehend. He was also accusing Peeling of directly mocking my posts, another breech of forum rules. \n \n All this is in addition to the fact that all these guys were doing is derailing a friendly discussion me and Peeling were trying to have which ended up once again dying. I welcome admin to read this thread and see that once again I got attacked by multiple evolutionists from multiple irrelevant directions while they never answered any of the relevant questions I asked. \n \nAnd I question if you even understand what he wrote. Or if you understand what satire means. Several of those posts were directly mocking your opinions. I realize satire is a lost art, but please try.\n",

How on earth could we find a genetic marker in a \"long dead animal\"?\n \n As for evidence of common ancestry, I'll give you some. It was noted in the past that humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes while the rest of the great apes have 24. This fact was joyously celebrated by creationists (ignorant of genetics) in the past. At the same time, these creationists didn't dispute the common ancestry of various equidae even though these species have differing numbers of chromosomes. For example, the reason that mules and hinnys are sterile is the differing number of chromosomes in the parents (donkeys=62, horses=64).\n \n As I recall, in the early 80's a new gram negative stain was developed that revealed hetero-chromatic banding in chromosomes. Comparisons of these patterns in human and chimp chromosomes allowed researchers to match every band in humans with a corresponding band in chimps. Some of these banding patterns were transposed and some were inverted, but all were present in both species. Of more interest was the fact that the banding on human chromosome 2 match two chimp chromosomes. Subsequent studies of gorillas and orangs gave similar results.\n \n As a result, a researcher made a prediction. He had two hypotheses to work with: 1) the two chromosomes in chimps, gorillas, and orangs was the result of three identical events after the separation of humans from the great ape lineages, or 2) human chromosome 2 is the result of the fusion of two chromosomes in the human lineage subsequent to the separation of humans from chimps. Since the second hypothesis was the most logical, the researchers went with that one. Their prediction was that if their hypothesis were true, i.e., that human chromosome 2 is the result of the end to end fusion of two chromosomes from an ancestral great ape lineage, that there would be 2 head to head telomeric sequences in the middle of the chromosome at the point that corresponded to the predicted joining of the two chimp chromosomes. Telomeres are repetitive sequences found at the end of chromosomes - not in the middle. When the sequencing of the predicted location was done, it revealed head to head telomeric sequences just as predicted.\n \n Of course, every chromosome has a centromere that functions during mitosis and meiosis. So, if human chromosome 2 is the result of the fusion of two active chromosomes, shouldn't there be two centromeres? So the scientist mentioned above proposed the hypothesis that there should be vestigial alphoid sequences (i.e., sequences typical of centromeres) at a particular location on human chromosome 2 that represented the site of an inactive centromere. The predicted location was the location that corresponded to the centromere on chimp chromosome 2q if it had been joined to chromosome 2p. When sequenced, that site did reveal the alphoid sequences that reveal an inactive centromere.\n \n I know that Archy won't understand any of that and will reject the fact that predictions made before the experiment offer any evidence. The problem for creationists is the this little bit of science gave us 3 predictions based on evolutionary theory that held true. Creationism predicted none of them. In fact, creationism offers no testable predictions.\n \n Just venting. Thanks.",

You see, my point has nothing to do with proving or disproving any genetic similarities with any members of the Great Ape Family at all. Because they are contemporaries of ours and are here to observe and see clearly that they are inferior to us in all aspects of development, so the chemical similarities we have with them prove nothing that works in the evolutionists favor. So let me ask you a direct question here in order to get this discussion back on track. As simply as possible, answer me this in your opinion, and with any evidence you have to support it. Here it is:\n \n By what standard of evidence does evolution science claim a direct evolutionary relationship with those hominids that preceded us such as Java, Peking and Neanderthal MAN, Is it based on chromosomal, amino acids, cytochrome c, genetics, DNA, lifestyle, or simply based on their hominid/primate similarities? Now if you come back with evidence that Neanderthal buried their dead, and deduce from that a direct relationship with modern man, then surely some chemical relationship has also been discovered since the advent of DNA technology, whether it it nuclear or mitochondrial similarities/connections, or one of the other chemical relationships mentioned above. \n \n There is a reason that evolutionists have declared this lineage between us and them and as simply as possible, could you, or someone provide the evidence upon which they base that conclusion?",

Let's look back at an earlier version of Archie's \"question\":Also, I just recently asked the whole bunch of you how you can claim so adamantly that the so called primate/hominid fossils such as Lucy, Peking, Java and Neanderthal MAN are related to modern man because of genetic markers that evolutionists claim is evidence of our biological kinship, when chimps share 98% of our DNA, and are contemporary to us currently so we can observe first hand how inferior they are to us in all aspects of intelligence, imagination, creativity and reason. Not one of you dealt with that question at all in a rational way. you all completely evaded even touching it even though I reposted it repeatedly.\nI responded,This is new to me. Show me the scientific sources that conclude that Lucy is related to modern man \"because of genetic markers.\" Then show me the scientific sources that say we are \"direct descendants of them\" as you claim below.\nTake a look at Archie's new question now. He has removed Lucy and the mention of genetic markers. However, he still wants us to provide biochemical evidence for Peking Man, a specimen that disappeared long before the advent of such analysis techniques.\n \n So I propose the following: Archangel needs to find an actual claim made by scientists that declare two specimens related and ask a question about that instead of relying on a morphing, goal-post shifting challenge laced with false implications. I see no reason to try to answer his question until his question has some basis in reality such that revealing his mistakes won't result in a complete change in what he allegedly wants to see.\n \n In regards to the chromosome data, Archangel, do you deny that this is extremely strong -- possibly irrefutable -- evidence that humans and the other great apes share a common ancestor? How is that not biochemical evidence of evolution? Do you have an alternate explanation for why this is the case if we in fact do not share a common ancestor?\n \n \nBecause they are contemporaries of ours and are here to observe and see clearly that they are inferior to us in all aspects of development, so the chemical similarities we have with them prove nothing that works in the evolutionists favor.\n\n Differences in behavior or any proposed \"inferiority\" does not change this evidence, so stop pretending that it means anything. If I can outperform somebody born with severe mental defects, does that mean that we aren't the same species? If I can outperform somebody born with no defects at all, does that mean we aren't the same species? Hell no. Quit the evasion.

   "Now, see, this is very interesting. Let's look back at an earlier version of Archie's \"question\":\n\n \n Why is it that rather than just answer my questions and push the debate forward, you must always stop the debate and critique my posts?

However, he still wants us to provide biochemical evidence for Peking Man, a specimen that disappeared long before the advent of such analysis techniques.\n\n \n Of course I removed Lucy this time lyte; you all have refused to answer the meat of my question and focussed only on your disagreement with her being a part of the question. And what do you mean that the specimen of Peking Man disappeared long before such analysis techniques existed? Have the fossils of peking Man evaporated or somehow ceased to exist? \n \n And if no specimen of Peking Man, then what about Java or Neanderthal Man? Have no tests been attempted to test them for biochemical evidence as it compares with modern man?\n \n \nSo I propose the following: Archangel needs to find an actual claim made by scientists that declare two specimens related and ask a question about that instead of relying on a morphing, goal-post shifting challenge laced with false implications. I see no reason to try to answer his question until his question has some basis in reality such that revealing his mistakes won't result in a complete change in what he allegedly wants to see.\n\n \n But it isn't me making the claim that we are related to these ancient fossils. It is the science of evolution that claims we have evolved from them/are related to them either directly or indirectly. How ever it is phrased, the claim is made that we are descendants of them and they are early ancestors to us. Are you now denying that? If not, then why are you complicating the question I asked of Pandion above? Which is, by what standard do you/evolutionists claim a direct relationship between us and them? And I demanded no specific direction by which you answered my question, and I quote from my post above:\n \nIs it (the relationship between modern man and ancient hominid fossils) based on chromosomal, amino acids, cytochrome c, genetics, DNA, lifestyle, or simply based on their hominid/primate similarities?\n\n So I made no demands that any particular evidence be forwarded. Only that what ever evidence you rely on to believe it be forwarded. So why are you squirming and being so evasive? Why are you refusing to answer such an allegedly basic question according to every other debate we have had where you claim this info is a no brainer, and that I must be ignorant not to get it? Are you unable to answer this question that is the foundation of what evolutionary theory claims is fundamental to the truth that it claims to be?\n \n \nIn regards to the chromosome data, Archangel, do you deny that this is extremely strong -- possibly irrefutable -- evidence that humans and the other great apes share a common ancestor? How is that not biochemical evidence of evolution? \n\n I don't know, that is why I have asked you what evidence you rely on to claim it to be true.\n \n \nDifferences in behavior or any proposed \"inferiority\" does not change this evidence, so stop pretending that it means anything. If I can outperform somebody born with severe mental defects, does that mean that we aren't the same species?\n\n \n So are you now claiming that the whole modern, multiple species of primates currently defined as members of the Ape Family are in fact afflicted with severe mental defects ? And that explains why we are so far advanced over them? Because you would be alone in that belief as no scientific theory has ever made such a claim that I am aware of.\n \n \nIf I can outperform somebody born with no defects at all, does that mean we aren't the same species? Hell no.\n \n \n Of course not but you would never claim to outperform that other \"normal\" person in ALL aspects of life. For example, a farm boy raised on a Farm in Idaho will excel in ways that you could never come close to, where as he would fail miserably if placed in the world you were raised in. All things being relative, people respond according to our personal environments. But raise a chimp in a home with a family for 21 years as we do a child, and that chimp still wont be capable of moving away from the family, getting a job and living on his own no matter how well you train him.\n \n \nQuit the evasion. The chromosome challenge spells out the relationship between humans and other extant apes.\n\n \n That's why I have asked the question. But it seems that rather than answer my question directly, you are more intent on just trying to get me to accept your conclusion because you insist it is so. So I will repeat my question to Pandion.

Evolutionists date the Precambrian rock at a billion years; the Cretaceous at 150 million years. The contact line between the two different strata is like a knife-edge, suggesting that instead of an overthrust, the strata were water-deposited in that order. This contact line can be clearly seen at Chief Mountain, with the older strata resting directly on top of the younger.2\n \n Since evolutionists suppose the Precambrian era to be the age before life evolved, and the Cretaceous period to be the age of the dinosaurs, the entire evolutionary time scale is at stake. The idea that such a large section of the Rocky Mountains uplifted and slid twelve to fifty miles to the east without leaving any evidence of movement is incredible. It is more reasonable to believe that the geological time scale is in error.\n \n Evolutionists have proposed two theories, one that a massive fold got started in the earth's crust, sheared, and forced to the east3, the other that the block of strata slid down a slope.4 The biggest problem with both theories is the size of the rock sheet. In order for an overthrust of the entire geologic column to occur, the original rock sheet would have been three miles high. A three-mile high, 12,000 square mile rock sheet doesn't tend to slide anywhere or overturn easily. The forces required to move it would have exceeded the crushing strength of the rock.\n \n We investigated the Lewis Overthrust with creation geologist Michael Oard in August 2002. He showed us the contact at Marias Pass from a distance, and you can get a perspective of the magnitude of the problem. Near Trick Falls at the Two Medicine campground, we hiked to an area where a flood in 1964 exposed the contact. Michael showed us a Ph.D. thesis that was written about this area, and the researcher puzzled over the problem that the slickensides were 90 degrees from the expected direction of the rock movement, and the integrity of the underlying strata does not justify an overthrust of the magnitude expected.\n\n \n The mechanical paradox of large overthrust sheets. Did a practical on it in my final year, got 64% i think. S,funny it more or less considered solved, what with revelations about ductile sliding and shale lubrication and so on. Maybe the problem is that an \"evolutionist\" is doing a geologists job. Oh well, good thing geology is rarely called into question in these debates, it being as solid as a nice Precambrian schist.",

And yet you come back and infer I'm ignorant for mentioning a process that electrolyte raised in his last post. And for an example of what I'm asking, here is both a claim that Neanderthal isn't related to modern man, and yet others within the scientific community believe he is.\n \n http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Homo_neanderthalensis\n Homo neanderthalensis\n H. neanderthalensis lived from about 250,000 to as recent as 30,000 years ago. Also proposed as Homo sapiens neanderthalensis: There is ongoing debate over whether the \"Neanderthal Man\" was a separate species, Homo neanderthalensis, or a subspecies of H. sapiens. While the debate remains unsettled, the prevailing view of evidence, collected by examining mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosomal DNA, currently indicates that little or no gene flow occurred between H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens, and therefore, the two were separate species.\n Krings et. al. (1997) found in genetic studies that Neanderthals and modern humans diverged genetically 500,000 to 600,000 years ago, suggesting that though they may have lived at the same time, Neanderthals did not contribute genetic material to modern humans. One of the participants of this study concluded: \"These results [based on mitochondrial DNA extracted from Neanderthal bone] indicate that Neanderthals did not contribute mitochondrial DNA to modern humans... Neanderthals are not our ancestors\" (PSU 1997). Subsequent investigation of a second source of Neanderthal DNA supported these findings. However, supporters of the multiregional hypothesis point to recent studies indicating non-African nuclear DNA heritage dating to one mya, as well as apparent hybrid fossils found in Portugal and elsewhere, in rebuttal to the prevailing view.\n So evidently my question about bio-chemical tests wasn't so stupid as mitochondrial DNA, being a biochemical type test has been done? So now can any of you answer my question above?",

   "Why is it that rather than just answer my questions and push the debate forward, you must always stop the debate and critique my posts?\n\n I answer this charge here.\n \n \nOf course I removed Lucy this time lyte; you all have refused to answer the meat of my question and focussed only on your disagreement with her being a part of the question.\n\n Because, as explained above, your question is fraudulent.\n \n \nHave the fossils of peking Man evaporated or somehow ceased to exist?\n\n For all intents and purposes, yes. But you didn't know that, did you? Of course you didn't; it would require even the slightest familiarity with Peking Man to know that.\n \n \nAnd if no specimen of Peking Man, then what about Java or Neanderthal Man?\n\n Java Man is not thought to be a direct ancestor of humans, so your question also doesn't apply.\n Neanderthal Man is a better question; there is still some dispute, and Neanderthal Man is recent enough that some genetic analysis has been done, but the majority of scientists think that they are not our direct ancestors.\n \n \nBut it isn't me making the claim that we are related to these ancient fossils.\n\n Note how Archangel switches from \"direct ancestors\" to \"related to.\" Note also that this is immediately after characterizing his challenge as \"morphing\" and \"goalpost shifting.\"\n And it's not me making the claim that they are our direct ancestors. In fact, it's you, Archie, making the claim that I'm making the claim...\n \n \nIt is the science of evolution that claims we have evolved from them/are related to them either directly or indirectly. How ever it is phrased, the claim is made that we are descendants of them and they are early ancestors to us.\n\n In making his case, Archie makes a statement, then says that that's the same as the second statement. But they are different statements. Archangel is neither a direct descendant of his uncle nor a direct ancestor of his uncle. Making this statement is not the same as claiming that he isn't related to his uncle. The fact that Archie either doesn't understand this or pretends to not understand this shows that he either doesn't understand simple reasoning or that he's purposely being an XXX.\n \n \nWhich is, by what standard do you/evolutionists claim a direct relationship between us and them?\n\n There, now was that so hard? Do you see how easy it is ask a question without lacing it with falsehoods and fallacies?\n \n But Kronus and obvious_child make a good point. What evidence would you accept? More importantly, what evidence would you even understand? If you can't even realize that you're related to a parent's brother without being a direct descendant or ancestor, why should I expect you to understand genetic comparison of mtDNA or comparison of skeletons?\n \n \n[regarding the chromosome challenge] I don't know, that is why I have asked you what evidence you rely on to claim it to be true.\n\n How the hell do you not know? Do you have an alternate explanation that doesn't serve as incredibly strong evidence for common ancestry? The fact that human chromosome 2 has all of the signs of resulting from two ancestral chromosomes is evidence. Or are you actually asking to see the scientific papers that discuss the telomeres, the inactive centromere, and the banding patterns? Do you think we're just making up all of this?\n \n \nSo are you now claiming that the whole modern, multiple species of primates currently defined as members of the Ape Family are in fact afflicted with severe mental defects ?\n\n Nope. And if you hadn't separated this statement from its context, it would have been clear to anybody with a sixth grade reading comprehension capacity. The point was that \"inferiority\" as you speak of it is no cause to reject the biochemical evidence for common ancestry.\n \n \nOf course not but you would never claim to outperform that other \"normal\" person in ALL aspects of life.\n\n And you won't outperform a Rhesus macaque in speed tree-climbing. Does that make you an inferior creature to Rhesus macaques? Let you grow up in the woodlands, and you still won't be as good a climber. Does that mean that you are inferior?\n No, it just means that macaques are well-evolved for their environment.\n \n \nBut it seems that rather than answer my question directly, you are more intent on just trying to get me to accept your conclusion because you insist it is so.\n\n No, you'll get an answer as soon as I'm convinced that there is any answer that you will accept. It's taken half a dozen posts to get you to ask your question in a way that wasn't loaded. I want to know what kind of evidence you will accept instead of dumbly passing off as fraudulent atheist conspiracy material.\n \n I would actually prefer to start with the chromosome data and work backward. On the other hand, if you don't understand that evidence has been set right in front of you when evidence has been set right in front of you -- wihch seems to be the case with the chromosome challenge -- I really don't think that there's anything I can tell you that you will accept. You can ignore eighty tons of evidence as easily as you've ignored everything you've seen here so far, and I have no reason whatsoever to believe that you won't.",

   "Well, since you ask. From day one you have been nothing but abusive. Without any provocation you were obnoxious to all and sundry.

That, on top of the fact that you've shown no insight or understanding of the subject, means that no one in their right mind would waste the effort of debating you formally. \n \n Since you ask.\n\n \n What do you think you have been like since day one kronus? A gentleman? This thing called respect is a two way street you know, and you have trashed me since the first opinion I shared that offended you secular humanists so much. But what I find interesting is that I have been begging you all, without attacking you, to just honestly answer what is apparently a simple question to the most inept evolutionist. Yet it is seemingly beyond the lot of you to answer me. Or is it fear of what my response will be to your answer? So I did some research of my own and came to some interesting conclusions. \n \n So rather than wasting my time asking you to answer my question, just listen up and learn. Oh, and TQ, it isn't mDNA, it's mtDNA if you want to abbreviate mitochondrial DNA properly. So, my question was, by what standard do evolutionists base their belief that we are related to these ancient Apes. And the answer is that they have tested mtDNA on Neanderthal and found minimal similarities which leads them to believe that minimal assimilation between early humans and Neanderthals took place. But some did, just not a lot. This link actually suggests that, and I quote: The authors conclude that in order to see the level of mtDNA overlap that we see, there had to be 120 matings or less. In thousands of years. Not much at all.\n \n And yet, other groups assume a lot of mixing. One group decided to compare European and African DNA and look for differences. There were plenty. Too many they claimed to be explained simply by the two groups being apart for a long time.\n \n The best explanation for the level of differences was some mixing between Cro-Magnon DNA and other DNA both in Europe and in Africa. In fact, the best way to explain the data was to say that the mixing rate was around 5%. That is 1 in 20.The most likely candidate for mixing in Europe was Neanderthal. The authors don't have a most likely candidate for Africa.\n And yet, it is claimed that all primates came out of Africa originally. Doesn't it stand to reason that we should find the most evidence of mixing there? Have any of you dared to ask such a question? Ali,,,\n The difference in the numbers between these two studies is huge. Of course both of these ideas are speculative and not really based on Neanderthal DNA from the nucleus. They are tied up in models that extrapolate the data back 30,000 years to explain our past. \n \n This is very tricky to do and a small change in the model can have huge effects. Now I do want to re-emphasize that the first group did look at mtDNA. But this kind of DNA makes up just 1/300,000th of our DNA and so it is a pretty small bit to look at. \n  \n \n Now if virtually every fossil of every single ancient hominid/primate could be said to have actually been found and tested, I might find these massive assumptions very interesting and even convincing. But as you well know, that claim could never be made with assurance. But wait, there is more. \n \n What if Cro-Magnon didn't find Neanderthal women attractive? But the Neanderthal men loved Cro-Magnon women? Then you might end up with a lot of mixing that is invisible to mtDNA. Why?\n \n Because mtDNA passes directly from mother to children. Dad's mtDNA is destroyed when the sperm fertilizes the egg. The Neanderthal mtDNA would be lost but there would be plenty of Neanderthal nuclear DNA around.\n \n What would really help answer the question is if scientists could look at more Neanderthal DNA. The DNA in the nucleus. And that is just what they have started to do.\n \n So obviously the nuclear DNA tells the rest of the story. So one must ask himself what would happen if we tested a primate that lived today and is a contemporary of ours. A chimp for example, which has already proven to share a lot of our genetic make up. Is it his DNA that is such a close match with us or some other less convincing genetic markers? As it turns out chimps do share, some say as much as 99.4% of human DNA suggesting that we are so closely related that chimps should not only be part of the same taxonomic family, but also the same genus. Isn't that incredible? \n \n Now we just have to explain why chimps failed to actually EVOLVE. Can anyone explain that little dilemma to me? \n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu6f0BMFH_n4BSftXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTFha252ZmV1BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNwRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkA1BSMDIwXzEyNgRsA1dTMQ--/SIG=128fgcb48/EXP=1203918452/**http%3a//media.newscientist.com/article.ns%3fid=dn3744\n \n http://www.thetech.org/genetics/news.php?id=37\n \n So my question remains, only this time with evidence that DNA has allowed for the possibility that their is a connection between Cro magnon, Neanderthal and modern man, which is part of the reason that evolutionary science makes the leap that we are related to them. But what is more startling is that rather than take a lesson from what we can plainly see in the chimp that lives along side of us today, so we know that the so called genetic similarities do not translate into a creature on the same level of sophistication as human beings at all. And yet the hope that we are related to these ancient primates carrying these minor genetic similarities with these long dead and extinct Apes is not only clung to but promoted as reasonable, rational and likely to be proven once we can get ahold of enough nuclear DNA. \n \n Now I can plainly see why none of you would answer my queries and have so fervently attacked me, and every aspect of my ONE SIMPLE question, rather than dare to answer it. What baffles me though is I thought you guys were interested in finding out what is true? If so, then why are you in such denial regarding the obvious wishful thinking that evolutionists must participate in to believe that these long dead Apes have any real relationship to us when modern chimps who share almost 100% of our genetic material are so obviously lower animals with absolutely no shared characteristics at all with humanity in the important areas that separate us from all lower life forms. \n \n Traits such as inventiveness, imagination, creativity, the need to build and improve the World we live in. The desire to mold the World to suit our needs rather than persist in living or dying according to the whims of the environment and ecosystem which we live within. That is what separates human beings with the lower animals, including the Chimpanzee, and including these so called ancient ancestors who shared certain genetic markers with us. But any rational thinker must admit that based on the contemporary chimp evidence, that conclusion is nothing more than a massive and radical assumption when held up to the light of day.\n \n Now you guys be sure to lay into me and expound about how ignorant i am. I know you will pick grammatical errors out and mis-speaks out and tear them apart. But I would hope that rather than nickel and dime me to death, that you would read the statement as a complete question and explanation of what is wrong with the conclusions evolution comes to based on such little actual evidence, when compared to the voluminous real time evidence we have with the Great Apes which live among us today. Also, I didn't use creation websites at all. I used your own information which gives the info I came to these conclusions with. The links are there so feel free to read them.

It also passes from mom to kids; in fact, dad's is destroyed right after an egg is fertilized! \n \n This weird DNA is found in little compartments in our cells called mitochondria. A mitochondrion's job is to make energy for the cell. Why would the cell's \"powerhouse\" have its own DNA?\n \n Because it used to be a creature living on its own. Or at least that is what scientists believe.\n \n Scientists think that a long time ago, our ancestors absorbed the mitochondrion's ancestor. Working together, this duo took over the world.\n \n But in the process, the mitochondria took a beating. Most of their DNA is now found in the nucleus of the host cell (although different species have mitochondria with differing amounts of DNA). The mitochondria can no longer live on its own-it is a hollow shell of what it once was. \n \n http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=165",

That's why I asked you evolutionists questions to start with so as to frame this debate on what you yourselves claim and accept to be true. But I couldn't get one of you allegedly intelligent evolutionists to answer one simple question.\n \n Instead, you all tore that question apart and questioned me about irrelevant minutia as you insulted my intelligence and called me ignorant and arrogant for believing i could actually phrase an intelligent question. Then, as you show how truly ignorant you are by asking all the wrong questions in response to my argument, you again have the nerve to claim I am too ignorant to understand what I read. Just accept that you have no argument to refute my claims other than declaring me ignorant as you once again will surely claim some perceived victory. That is your m.o. after all. And I notice you, once again didn't bother to post a link to prove that my response to you above was incorrect.

Instead, comparison of mtDNA to other mtDNA is thought of as more of a molecular clock.\n\n \n As I said above, why are you changing the subject and confusing the issue. The perspective you are bringing up might be relevant if we were discussing the lifestyles and practices of different unique groups of these types of Apes as their lifestyles relate to the evolutionary process. But were not discussing lifestyles as it affects evolution, but are more concerned with the mixing of Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon Man with the newly appearing Modern Man which encroached on their parts of the world whether it be Europe or Africa, and if they interacted, and how that interaction is observed on our modern DNA. \n \n If what you're suggesting was relevant, then Dr Starr would have raised it and dealt with it in his link as part of his explanation of this issue. Is that beyond your ability to understand? So you're trying to imply I am ignorant as you make yourself sound like you understand this subject when in fact you're confusing the issue once again with irrelevant minutia that is meant to confound and derail the actual point I'm making. Why are you doing that lyte? Are you purposely confusing the issue in order to derail the meat of my argument, or is it as I suspect, that you really don't have a clue about what you're saying once again, and are just getting caught bluffing your way through. \n \n The point of my argument, once again, is that if we have the whole spectrum of Great Apes living side by side with us today that allegedly, according to evolution, evolved side by side with us, share at least 98% of our genetic material as the chimp does; yet still live in no more a sophisticated existence than any other lower animals on Earth.\n \n While at the same time, the science of evolution claims that these ancient extinct Apes that also share Primate familiar genetic markers with humans, as chimps also do, are somehow related to us as members of the same evolutionary family, is irrational and unprovable that we are in fact related at all. We are different species, different genus, and a completely different taxonomic family. And it is not only completely impossible to prove otherwise, but a pipe dream to cling to such an unprovable conclusion.\n \n That is what this argument is about. Any tangent or side issue you try to raise is for another debate. What will really help move this debate forward is that you stop attempting to claim some false victory by declaring how ignorant I am and just dealing with the reality of my claims if that is possible.

Now post where I compared Gorillas to Centipedes? Go on lyte, I challenge you to!!! I am comparing all lower life forms to human beings, not to each other regarding their sophistication.\n\n \n Er...\n \n \nApes living side by side with us today that allegedly, according to evolution, evolved side by side with us, share at least 98% of our genetic material as the chimp does; yet still live in no more a sophisticated existence than any other lower animals on Earth.\n\n \n That's pretty clearly comparing apes with other, lower animals and saying they live a no more sophisticated existence. A centipede and a gorilla are concretizations of the general claim: apes vs any other lower animal on earth.\n \n Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I've opened a 1-1 debate on the subject. It's hard to make myself heard amidst all this.",

And that is that certain facts are self evident such as there are different levels of sophistication when dealing with the animal kingdom. But all animals fall short when compared to the sophistication of Man. My bad; I guess that expecting you people to make such obvious leaps is asking too much.",

   "This is pointless for a few reasons:\n 1) Archie is asking the old \"If we evolved from monkeys, how come there are still monkeys\" question, only he's fancied it up with genetic-type talk\n 2) Archie believes that evolution has a goal. Every species strives to be like us, but only we succeeded. This has been explained as wrong to him countless times in this thread, and in past threads\n 3) Archie refuses to realize that, as 'lyte said, he's basically asking \"Why does 2+2=5?\", and accuses people of being \"dishonest\", \"dishonorable\", \"antagonizing\", of \"derailing the thread\", or \"ignoring the meat of his post and questioning irrelevant details\" when they point out that 2+2 does not in fact equal 5, so what exactly is he asking?\n \n Those are just three of the reasons why this is a complete waste of time. The funny thing is, Archie thinks he's got everyone on the defensive, when it was pointed out to him about 3 pages back that the question he's asking is gibberish.",

   "PROVE IT!!! PROVE ANY OF WHAT YOU ASSUME TO BE TRUE REGARDING YOUR RELIGION OF EVOLUTION IS TRUE IN ANY WAY? THERE IN LIES THE RUB. YOU CAN'T.\nOf course there is no religion of Evolution, so the argument is nonsense anyway. \n \n As for you to want me to prove all of Evolution, what is normally documented through many years of school, I frankly don't have the time to covers years of you not listening or learning in school. It does require you showing a minimum of interest in actually learning what Evolution is. I have run into a few creationists who actually were interested in facts and who were honestly exploring this subject. You, with your deceptions, misrepresentations and strawmen is not one of them, so I frankly can't be bothered doing anything else than continue to expose your dishonesty and deceptions.\n \n If at some time you change and decide to be honest about this, then I have no problem changing my view about you, but until then, my interaction with you is all about exposing your dishonesty to others. There frankly is no point in any other interaction with dishonest posters like you than to expose your misrepresentations.\n \n... We'll see who is right and wrong someday.\nPascal's Wager is SOOO lame.",
