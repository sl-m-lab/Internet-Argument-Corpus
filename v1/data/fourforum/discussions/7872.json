   "What about the lawsuit against Winchester by the gun writer Rick Jamison going on over the rights to the basic Winchester Short Mag designs? Played a big role, imo, Bill.\n The Herstal Group of Herstal Belgium (the old Fabrique Nationale name comes to mind that used to make all the Belgian Browning pistols, rifles,and shotguns - just renamed to reflect the true umbrella parent status of all of the companies) who owns among other things Browning, who owned the rights to the Winchester name and designs, plus the plant location in New Haven that had been operated by the US Repeating Arms Inc (USRAC) under license to Browning. The Plant closing was in part because they were not turning a profit on the Winchester products manufactured there but that was Browning's fault for not supporting the brand and emphasizing the Browning brand...and the sell off was an excuse to pay off Rick Jamison's lawsuit and close the old inefficient outdated plant. Lots of the M70, M94's and M1300 shotguns sub assemblies that the plant produced had already been outsourced to Italy to another Herstal owned facility. For example I'm told that all the stocks wood and woodworking...but, the final assembly had remained in Connecticut. \n \n Note the massive change in the quality of the fit and finish of any of the M70's produced in the last 5-7 years and compared them to what was built before the very late '90s...and then compare the fit and finish of the current Browning product against the same time period and you will see a 180* shift in both brands. \n \n Current M70's are dogs compared to the earlier guns. Current Brownings are beautifully finished when their earlier guns frequently had severe mechanical problems and were re-designed several times to where they are today. \n \n Gun companies are being hit hard by corporate cannibalism, thus shooting themselves in the proverbial foot...",
