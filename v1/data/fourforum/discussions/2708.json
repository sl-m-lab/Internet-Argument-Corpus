   "Alright I have a question if this is a crime and if this man could be convicted for it.\n \n My friend Julie* made her own website and put pictures up of her on it. There was a few pictures Julie* had with Tito Jackson and an obvious MJ hater made his own site. He used these pictures without her permission (by the way she's a minor) and posted them everywhere, claiming things like she was a fat cow or something stupid like that. Because this guy (not a minor) used her picture without permission from her or her mother and also threatened and harrassed Julie*and others around her... Could this be a case? Does it have grounds enough to go to court? \n \n Please help, regardless of what you think of \"Sparks\" or MJ. Please.\n \n *name has been changed for her safety\n \n This guy publicy harrassed Julie* as well as her mother, me, and others (most were minors) He also harrassed me by filling up my inbox with threats and the like. Since this happened over the internet, could this be brought to court? There has to be laws against internet harrassment. I know nothing about this sort of thing, that's why I'm asking yall.\n \n Thanks... this isn't really a debate, I just need information... although you can debate it still. *shrugs*",

Why did he pay the family of the kid he \"supposedly\" molested $8million if he didn't do it?\n\n \n I really don't think Michael is gay, however it is looking suspiciously like he might be a pedaphile.\n \n Pedophile - someone who is sexually attracted to children.\n Homosexual - someone who is attracted to someone (an adult) of the same sex.\n \n There are also those who molest children, not because they are attracted to them, but to hurt and control them (if guilty, Michael could be in this group). In these situations sex is a weapon, like in rape - it's not a sexual act, it's a violent one - all about power and control. Since it's about power, they aren't looking for a victim they are attracted to - they are looking for an easy target. These tye of abusers have adult sexuality and the largest percentage are white, straight, men.\n \n Not a Michael fan, nor do I condone pedophilia or sexual abuse of children - just hate misinformation. Especially when it comes to kids getting hurt. Homo = pedophile does not address the real issue and THAT will lead to more kids getting hurt.",
