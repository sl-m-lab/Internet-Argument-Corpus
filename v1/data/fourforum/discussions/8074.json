   "Sooo, why did Porter Goss resign?\n \n \nGoss may be the first casualty of the expanding investigation into Duke Cunningham, otherwise known as Hookergate. Cunningham's indicted co-conspirators, defense contractors Brent Wilkes and Mitchell Wade, provided suites at the Westin and Watergate (sound familiar?) to entertain Congressman and other DC players. According to Ken Silverstein of Harper's, \"party nights began early with poker games and degenerated into what the source described as a \"frat party\" scene--real bacchanals.\" The FBI is investigating whether prostitutes were involved. The Watergate has received multiple subpoenas.\n \n Goss's #3 man at the CIA, Dusty Foggo, has already admitted to attending \"poker parties.\" Silverstein, one of the best investigative reporters in Washington, revealed last week that \"those under intense scrutiny by the FBI are current and former lawmakers on Defense and Intelligence comittees--including one person who now holds a powerful intelligence post.\"\n \n Goss certainly fits that bill.\n\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/thenation/20060505/cm_thenation/1582058_1",
