I understand many people do not like Bush, and I understand that. If you don't like Bush, and you give me a good reason why, then so be it. Everyone has their own opinions, and I'm not trying to change that. It's just that most people have to resort to childish comics to try and find flaws in the other candidate, much like some pro-Bush people are doing. However, John Kerry's whole campaign staff have gone too far. The guy dealing with all the money for the DNC has paid several websites to assassinate Bush's character and has also paid several people to go on talk shows and basically do the same hing. There is no place for that in politics, especially after Kerry's message at the DNC said that both parties needed to stop this type of action. And then they continue to do it. Not surprising if anyone around Kerry changes their minds like that.",

You have shown me a very minimal amount of facts. I am the one providing all the facts. His gross misconduct? What exactly are you talking about? You actually show me mainly your opinions, which are of no value to me. I continually bombard you with facts, and you respond with comments like, \"besides shoving the facts about bush's gross misconduct in your face, we continually show you that your relentless support for bush is based only on your biased denial of reality. you continue to justify bush for his flip flopping, and then make useless remarks about Kerry, as if anybody really cares\". I guess you had no response to my comments because I was right. Actually, I know I was. Useless remarks about Kerry? Saying he flip flops on the most important issues in his platform (Iraq, Patriot Act, trade with China, negative campaigning, eliminating marriage penalty for middle class, he took both sides of Gulf War, he can't decide what he wants to do with gay marriage, double taxation on dividends) is not useless. Maybe to someone like you it is, who understands nothing about politics. Oh, and many people do care. In case you didn't read the poll results, Kerry apparently lost points after his DNC. That is pretty damn pathetic. He should blame his wife. She has no business going out in public and saying what she does. I understand women speaking their minds, but someone who could be the first lady needs to speak more intelligently. And she blamed it on hecklers? What a joke. Someone saying \"4 more years\", give me a break. If you can't handle that, you don't need to be affiliated with politics.\n \n \n \n Here are some quality Kerry flip flops:\n \n \n 1) Kerry first states, \"When I vote to give the President of the United States the authority to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein, it is because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a threat, and a grave threat, to our security and that of our allies in the Persian Gulf region.\" (10/9/02)\n \n Kerry also stated, \"I believe that Saddam Hussein's ruthless, reckless breach of international values and standards of behavior which is at the core of the cease-fire agreement, with no reach, no stretch, IS CAUSE ENOUGH FOR THE WORLD COMMUNITY TO HOLD HIM ACCOUNTABLE BY USE OF FORCE.\" (10/9/02) (He said we can invade, not because of WMDs, but to save innocent Iraqis)\n \n Kerry then states, \"I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein, and when the President made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him.\" (5/4/03) (this was after we still had found no WMDs)\n \n Just 4 months later, Kerry changed his mind. \"It was wrong to rush to war without building a true international coalition and with no plan to win the peace.\" (9/2/03)\n \n 2) Kerry, when asked about the $87 billion bill to ensure US soldiers armor in Iraq, says...\"I don't think any US Senator is going to abandon our troops and recklessly leave Iraq to-to whatever follows as a result of simply cutting and running. That's irresponsible.\" (9/14/03)\n \n Then after voting to go to war, Kerry says this...\"Here is the value that John Edwards and I will put in place. I'm proud to say that John joined me in voting against that $87 billion when we knew the policy had to be changed.\" (7/12/04) (This $87 billion was to ensure that all US soldiers in Iraq had their own armor and bullet-proof vests)\n \n Those are 2 very important issues, which Kerry just blew off and completely changed his mind, sometimes within a few months. \n \n \n \n \npay attention to the first 2 cartoons, about what he said about bin laden in exactly 6 months. thats fact. kick up if you want, but you cant help but concede\n\n \n \n Notice the key word \"priority\". Priorities change with time. Not only do Kerry's priorities change, but his stance on every major issue changes. It is a fact that maybe that wasn't Bush's top priority. But we were and still are looking for Bin Laden. I don't need to concede because I am right. \n \n \nthe \"got coke\" one had me rolling! :p\n\n \n \n Did any of the cartoons of Clinton saying he smoked, but didn't inhale have you rolling? Since when does what a person does as a child predict or have any effect on what they might do 45 years from then? Someone getting a DUI when they are 20 does not mean that they will be an alcoholic and criminal when they are 65. There is no correlation. So, the coke issue is also not relevant at all to this. It just proves my point that Kerry and his campaigners have nothing else to prove Bush wrong on, so they instead show some dumb comics. Pretty sad if you ask me.",

No such report exists.\" Gordan Livingston, 06.03.03\n \n \n On April 26, President Bush said in his weekly radio address, \"My jobs and growth plan would reduce tax rates for everyone who pays income tax.\"\n That turned out not to be true. According to the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an unspecified number of low- and middle-income families received no tax cut at all because they'd been excluded from an expansion of the child-care tax. --Timothy Noah, 06.03.03\n \n On November 24, 2003, Bush boasted that we \"put the Taliban out of business forever.\" \n By May 2004, a member of the British Foreign Affairs Committee warned that \"Afghanistan is a basked case. It's a forgotten country.\" Opium production is rocketing and the Taliban and warlords are back in control in large areas. \n \n \n Asked later if his [Harken] stock sale had been related to the company's impending setback, {Board member] Bush replied, \"I absolutely had no idea and would not have sold it had I known.\"\n In fact, SEC records show that Harken's president had warned board members two months before Bush's sell-off that the company had liquidity problems that would \"drastically affect\" operations. --SF Chronicle, 07.05.02\n \n \n \"We're dealing with first-time responders to make sure they've got what's needed to be able to respond. \" - Bush, 3/27/2002\n However, his budget tried to cut more than $1 billion out of existing grants to local police/fire departments to fund this.

   "- iraq has weapons of mass destruction. source\n\n \n \n First off all, this is geocities.com. Anyone can make up a website there. I could make one up that says Bush has found them and try to cite it. We did find WMDs. From one of my previous posts, I showed how sarin, mustard, and VX nerve gas are WMDs. So don't even try to contest that, because they are WMDs and we did find them. Try this site...it says that we have found WMDs\n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38213\n \n \n \n- saddam tried to buy uranium from nigeria source\n\n \n Source (http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/iraq/threat.htm)\n \n Who said he tried to buy uranium from Nigeria? It is known that he has been seeking to buy WMDs from other Middle Eastern countries. He also \"tried repeatedly to divert highly enriched uranium from its French- and Soviet-built civilian reactors\". \n \n \"Before their forced departure from Iraq in 1998, U.N. weapons inspectors oversaw the destruction of more than 40,000 chemical munitions, nearly 500,000 liters of chemical agents, 1.8 million liters of chemicals used in the manufacture of such chemical-war agents, and seven types of delivery systems, including ballistic missile warheads.\" Why did he need 40,000 chemical weapons? And what makes you think he couldn't hide a few of them from the UN inspectors? \n \n \n \n \n \n- there is a connection between saddam and al qaeda source\n\n \n \n But there is a connection between Saddam and Bin Laden (the man who attacked us). Look at the 9/11 Commission Report, page 66-67. It will tell you all you need to know. So maybe he had no direct connection with Al Qaeda, but he did with the Taliban and he did with Hamas and Hezbollah.\n \n \n \n- saddam's mass graves contained 300,000 to 400,000 iraqis source\n\n \n \n \n This site says Tony Blair was wrong. What is your point by this? I thought you said Bush lied, and then you send me to some British site where it says Blair lied. Get your facts straight. Maybe they haven't found graves with 400,000 people in it, but Saddam did murder over 150,000 Kurds and over 100,000 of his own people. If you don't believe me, here you go...(http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/iraq/news/20030404-1.html)\n \n \"Human Rights Watch estimates that Saddam's 1987-1988 campaign of terror against the Kurds killed at least 50,000 and possibly as many as 100,000 Kurds\"\n \"According to Human Rights Watch, \"senior Arab diplomats told the London-based Arabic daily newspaper al-Hayat in October [1991] that Iraqi leaders were privately acknowledging that 250,000 people were killed during the uprisings, with most of the casualties in the south.\"\n \"More than 200,000 Iraqis continue to live as refugees in Iran.\"\n \"Saddam Hussein's regime has carried out frequent summary executions, including: 4,000 prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in 1984; 3,000 prisoners at the Mahjar prison from 1993-1998; 2,500 prisoners were executed between 1997-1999 in a \"prison cleansing campaign\"; 122 political prisoners were executed at Abu Ghraib prison in February/March 2000; 23 political prisoners were executed at Abu Ghraib prison in October 2001; At least 130 Iraqi women were beheaded between June 2000 and April 2001 \"\n \n \n This totally proves he killed over 250,000 innocent people. You are wrong once again.\n \n \n \n \n- al qaeda has been crippled\n\n \n \n It has been. Do you not watch the news? Yesterday Pakistanis arrested around 5 top-ranking Al Qaeda leaders. And every time you turn the TV on you hear about US troops killing Al Qaeda members. So they are being cripples as we speak.\n \n \n \n \n- america has been made safer with the conquest of iraq\n\n \n \n \n Yes we have. We no longer have to worry about someone who threatened to use WMDs on us and our allies. We have had ZERO domestic terror attacks since we invaded Iraq. That is pretty safe if you ask me.\n \n \n \n \n- we are at a war against terrorism\n\n \n \n What do you actually think we are doing in Iraq?

And it makes Kerry look a lot worse. And I guess it worked, because Kerry has actually lost points in the polls since his convention. Once again, pretty sad if you ask me. You have 4 days to yourself to gather up all your fellow Democrats and state you position on a lot of issues. And then you lose points? Why, in Kerry's hour long boring speech, did he not mention a thing about his 20+ years in the Senate?
