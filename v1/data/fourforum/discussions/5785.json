   "The news media right now is barely covering what is happening with Haliburton. They just posted their report for Iraq profits for 2004 at over $7 billion. That's up from just over $4 billion for 2003. They just got the contract for building a new Guantanomo that will probably cost a half billion. They got the contract for expanding army bases in the Balkans with a probably cost of a billion dollars. This is the company has been found guilty of overcharges and kickbacks, and is still under continuous investigation. They just received a bonus from the military Reward Fee Board of 72 million dollars. The breaking news is that they have discovered that Haliburton was involved in bribes to Nigeria in return for favoritism and sweet deals in their oil fields. This final bit of news should get Haliburton busted for illegal trading practices.\n \n Does anyone else see the profits of huge corporate GOP contributors and control of the Iraqi oil fields as the real Bush agenda?",

   "Well, it certainly wasn't the day to day welfare of everyday Iraqis that drove the choice to invade..........\n\n \n That's the new US jobs retention policy. Devastate the infrastructure of a third-tier nation unable to defend itself, the public will accept any rationale, have congress vote a big chunk of money to repair it, give the repair contract to a US company with an inside track to administration favors.\n \n You get the military receiving big buck bonuses and promise of college educations to accomplish the destruction and subsequent police actions, maintaining reenlistment goals, while paying US contractor private laborers $80k/yr tax free to act like they're fixing it. The only losers in a deal like that are US taxpayers, the Iraqi people, lots of dead from both sides and US world image. But it does help the new jobs number.",

I don't think there was any big family money from Casper, Wyoming (speculation) and he's been in public service and then politics for virtually all of his adult life. Gives the appearance of Cheney being sent to Halliburton to make his fortune before playing serious politics. Be interesting to know who major holders of Haliburton were at the time of need. But that's like trying to run down a chain of trusts with adequate legal shelter.",

   "Update: Congress today is having investigative hearings about Haliburton. The running tally for over charges and charges for services and products not provided is running into the billions. It looks like their final report is going to be appalling. However, that does not automatically mean government is going to change anything. The inside Haliburties are still giving away contracts to them even during this type of investigation.",
