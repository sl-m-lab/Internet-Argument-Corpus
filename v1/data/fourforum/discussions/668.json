   "Should public schools set aside a time for prayer during class? Not necessarily coordinated or endorsed by faculty or staff.\n \n Pro - Yes schools should set a time at the beginning or after class to pray. This praying applies to any religion they follow, Christianity, Islam, Judiasm, etc... To not allow students to do this would be to take away a freedom of religious expression and also shut god out of their lives. \n \n \n Con - No a prayer time should not be set aside during school even the length of 5 minutes because it takes away time from student education. It may offend or discomfort any atheists, agnostics, or other religious groups since also they would be praying alone where as in most public schools christians could pray together. Prayer can and should be done before or after school hours and saying \"shuts god out of their lives\" is a matter of opinion and, since they can pray as long as they want later its really not doing anything of the sort. \n \n What do you think about this issue?\n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

(For instance I read a news report a few weeks ago that said that the department of education would be taking away funding for a large majority of schools that did not allow a prayer time.) So once again any pro's on the subject are especially encouraged to post here. Since we seem to have so many cons.\n \n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "I get so tired of typing this sort of thing. Maybe I should do it once and save it.\n \n There is no prohibition against any sort of religious club that meets before or after school. The constitutional principle is that no branch of government may approve or disapprove of of the practice of religion. That means that no particular sect may be granted approval, and no sect may be denied equal treatment. By this principle, the practice of Wiccans was allowed on a military reservation because (among other stated constitutional principles) Protestants, Catholics and Jews were permitted to practice their religion openly on that same reservation.\n \n So private prayers, even if conducted as a group, are permitted before school, during school and after school. Morning flagpole prayer meeting have become very popular recently. None of it is a problem.\n \n So wjim1269 is absolutely correct. We're not talking about education but the private practice of religion that is not part of the educational policy of the school. I'll vote for that. What I have a problem with is the imposition of another's religion on me or my children without our consent. Thus, I object to prayers to Jesus before football games recited over the school owned PA. How many of those present do not wish to pray to Jesus? In my school district, a significant number. And yet these students are required by their participation in sports, drill team, chearleading and band to pray to a deity that they do not accept.\n \n Lest you object that they can just remain silent, you should know that the Supreme Court has found that standing silent is not a recognition of the rights of dissidents are violated by the expectation that they remain silent. Unless they are granted a meaningful avenue of protest, their 1st Amendment rights have been violated.\n \n Here's how it works. The Constitution prohibits even the appearance of approval or disapproval of religion by an arm of the state. Thus, praise of Jesus before football game is a violation of the Constitution and cannot be offset by like consideration for other religions. Where should it end? And to whom should an athiest pray?\n \n The objection that official prayer takes something away from the school day is weak at best. My objection is that it imposes a religion by force.",

   "I say give them the lousy 5 minutes to do with it what they will. Think back to your days in school, did 5 minutes really add all that much to whatever you were doing at the time? Did those 5 minutes make a difference between learning about the Ancient Sumarians or not having a clue? No, it's 5 minutes, life is short, if someone wants 5 minutes to doodle, pray, wake up, or day dream is it that bad that they are offered 5 minutes to silently do whatever it is they wish to do? I'm not saying prayer should be led, I'm not saying they should pray aloud, but how can something you do silently by yourself offend anyone? If that were the case women would be offended by men on a minute by minute basis! (tongue in cheek) :p",

   "During the years that I was most interested in my local school district, it was always the practice to recite prayers over the PA before every sporting event. These prayers were always \"student lead\" so the school district could claim that it was maintaining separation of chruch and state. However, the prayer was always recited by a member of the fundamentalist christian club. Never was a prayer recited by a Sikh, Muslim, Mormon, or Catholic, and probably none of the other main line Christian sects either. Members of this same christian club acosted other students in the halls of the school before class, between classes, and after class. They passed out tracts. One of my sons became a target for some reason (perhaps it was because he took their tracts and just dropped them on the ground). During his senior year he was harrassed daily in spite of requests to leave him alone. To his credit, he was never physically violent. But I digress.\n \n These fundamentalist christian clubs existed (and still do as far as I know) in all of the schools of the district. Back when my kids were in school, there were four high schools with 2500 to 3000 students. That went to 5 high schools while they were there and it is now 8. It is the largest school district in Texas. Back when I attended the sporting events (while my kids were there), all of the schools of the district selected a student from the fundamentalist christian club to recite a prayer before every sporting event. You see, all of the schools of the district used to play each other (too many now).\n \n But all of that stopped with the decision of the SCOTUS in Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe. In a 6-3 decision, such practices as were carried on in my school district were found to be unconstitutional.\n \n So to answer the questions.\n \n Should religious groups get the same rights as other groups or clubs? Without a doubt. I firmly maintain that this is a right guaranteed by our Constitution.\n \n The problem is that they have been granted more rights where I live. Our President, Vice President, Attorney General and Secretary of Defense are examples of the attitude where I live. The constant religious babble (and morning hymn singing at the Justice Department) from these \"leaders\" displays their dismal ignorance of religion, our Constitution, and science. Because of men like our current leadership, we have passed our zenith and are on the decline. Already over 50% of our scientists and doctors come from foreign countries. We produce scientific XXXXXX from our schools and must go elsewhere for to staff our university faculties.\n \n Why do you think that is?",
