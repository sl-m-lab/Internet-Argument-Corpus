   "Just in time for the holidays...\n \n I was wondering how other homosexuals like myself handle family visits during the holidays that may involve homophobic behavior.\n \n During the past 2 years I have had to \"behave myself\" around certain members of my fiance's family. This means no hand holding, no kisssing, no touching, no flirting. Now sitting around with a big family and seeing the occassional hug or kisses between spouses, wouldn't you feel resentful that you couldn't also kiss your intended or even hug them? What if this upset you and you got quiet. Then everyone noticed you being quiet and asked your intended (not you directly) what was bothering you? What if your intended didn't know because they hadn't even been in the same room with you all day? Wouldn't you be resentful?\n \n What if three weeks after you got engaged, you went to see her family for the second time ever. What if the whole time passed and nobody noticed your engagement ring and your intended (who proposed to you on one knee) never announced that you were engaged.\n \n How would this make you feel?",

   "I am lucky to have a very open minded family and my partner's family is even more accepting. This holiday I have my parents, my partner's parents, my sister and her husband and three kids all coming to stay for the holidays. So we will need to defag the house. I am very excited to have everyone come stay for xmas week, (and shopping at toys r us like a madman, should have bought stock) but I feel wierd that I need to hide a little too! We can't kiss or hold hands. We are sort of big on giving each otehr a kiss before you leave the house. Even if you are running to the store, you could have a wreck. So we are big on always saying \"i love you\" before we leave each other. We will need to refrain from most of that when the folks are here. Not because they would be bothered but for us and the world we live in,well it is too weird to have affection in front of others even in our own home. I will live thourgh it and we will steal our kisses when we can.\n \n It is frustrating that my sister and her husband can do it but we can't, especially during the gift openning since we always shop well for each other. but I will live.",

   "Lady;\n \n (Good to see you again! emoticon_xlove )\n \n I understand completely.\n I rarely get to spend the holidays with my partner at all. She is only \"out\" to her mother, who has requested that she never tell the rest of her family. \n So, every other Christmas (winter holidays) she travels half way across the country and spends it with her family. I have only met her parents one at a time. Her father once when he came out for some reason, and spent the time with his half-bother. I dropped my partner off on our way home from work so they could have dinner together.\n Her mom I met when she insisted on coming out when my partner had some minor surgery.\n So, needless to say, I'm not welcome to tag along when she goes to her parent's for the holidays and strangely the years she doesn't go to her parents, she's with her Uncle and his family. (She's not out to them either, but they at least know my son and myself)\n Also the years that she does go to her parent's usually coincides with the years my son goes to his father's for Christmas as well. \n Those years I'm all alone on Christmas. \n \n My family on the other hand all know. I came out to my parents and subsequently to the rest of my family one at a time. My parents, brother and sister-in-law and nieces are all very accepting and warm towards my partner and I. My Aunt, Uncle and cousins are another story altogether. \n After I came out to them I stopped getting invitations to family gatherings. I was cut off from family news and announcements. Sometimes I hear second hand from my brother. Sometimes I don't, because he just can't get it through his head that they really are that closed minded about it.",

   "As far as family visits with my family, I simply don't go. I told my family long ago that they either accpt me and Ron both, or they could do without my presence. They made their choice. Frankly, I don't miss all the gossiping about who is doing what to whom or what \"Aunt Bessie\" said.\n \n Normally, Ron and I spend the holidays with our freinds, both gay and straight, who accept us as we are. Ron's parents live overseas. A couple of times we have flown over to spend the holidays with them. They are really sweet people. They treat me like one of the family. And it is kinda nice to spend Christmas Eve strolling a warm sand beach hand in hand under the stars.",

I know how you feel. Even though I am an artist, it just doesn't pay all the bills all the time. I've been looking for a full-time position for several months now. I was lucky in that I was getting some temporary assignments, but at the moment I'm not working...and here it is December with the holidays upon us. I really hate this time of year.\n No one is hiring because it's so late in the year. At least not in the field where I have experience. I've done the retail thing and just can't go back to it. I tried it last year just to remind myself just how much I hate it. I like my artwork, but getting shows is really tough this time of year as well. Galleries don't want to take on new artists in December. They say it's too risky. They rely on return business and known artists for the majority of sales at this time of year. \n At least I have a wonderful and understanding partner/wife who knows this is a really rough time of year for me. She knows I go into an ugly depression from November to sometime in March or even not until after the beginning of April. She knows I do what I can and even though she will be with her family her love is always there for me. \n Besides, I just found out today that my son will actually be comming home two days BEFORE Christmas!!!! \n YIPPIE!!! \n So I won't be all alone after all. That's so sweet of him. Granted, I also know he has alterior motives for wanting to be home too...he has a girlfriend who he's very enamored with. \n \n Happy Hanukkah Lady!!!! \n Have a great time with the folks!",
