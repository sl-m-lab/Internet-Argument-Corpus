   "Some while back we took steps here in Alaska to thwart the efforts of those who would pervert the meaning of the 2nd ammendment, or in our case Article 1 Section 19. We added verbage to our constitution that even Sarah Brady can't misconstrue. Ours reads:\n \n \nA well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. The individual right to keep and bear arms shall not be denied or infringed by the State or a political subdivision of the State.\n\n \n Other states have made similar revisions. I would encourage people in states that haven't to push their elected officials to do so.",
