   "Darlene Bogle used to be a leader of an Exodus-affiliated ex-gay ministry. She was speaking at a religious conference in 1990 when she met the woman who would later become her partner. Darlene soon left the movement to built a life with Des. In 1996, Des was diagnosed with breast cancer, and she passed away in 2005. Last year, Darlene was one of three former ex-gay leaders to formally apologize for their roles in the movement.\n \n Anthony Falzarano is another ex-gay ministry leader. He founded PFOX in 1996 with the help of the Family Research Council. He is now the head of Parents and Friends Christian Ministries. Last week, he wrote an email to Beyond Ex-Gay addressed to Darlene:\n Darlene, I'm glad I ran across your blog. I still miss you. I am sorry to hear that your lover died of breast-cancer. Darlene is God sending you a message? Please consider coming back to Exodus. You are loved and missed. Why would God call you back to lesbianism, give you a lover and then take her away. I'm sorry that you are going through this. My heart is breaking right now but I believe that you belong to the Lord and \"He chastizes the one's that he loves\". I believe He is calling you back. If you want to talk I am here to listen. Please call me at [removed] if you want to talk. May God Bless You, Anthony Falzarano\n \"If you want to talk, I am here to listen,\" he says. Darlene, it turns out, has a lot to say, and she's saying it publicly. \n http://rising-up.blogspot.com/2008/08/twisted-love.html\n And yes, she's as shocked as you are:\n I was appalled when I read his words, which on the surface seem so compassionate. It was such a strong reminder of why I left Exodus and could never consider going back under their \"umbrella of faith.\" How arrogant of Anthony to send such a condemning statement as to ask if God was sending me a message! [Emphases in the original]\n\n http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2008/08/08/2533\n \n THIS is the \"love\" of the \"ex-gay\" ministry.\n Perhaps gays should take it upon themselves to look for anti-gay religious proponents and send a similar message?\n Naw. We shouldn't stoop to the level that these guys dwell at.",

   "I wonder how many ministers would say something like this to a husband? God took your wife because of <fill in the sin<. Insensitive, ignorant pig. More justification for me in my religious choices.\n\n \n About 15 years ago my partner of 12 years died of AIDS. I received letters from two clients because they had seen my name in his obituary - I can't imagine they knew I was gay prior to that. In any event, within a few days of my partner's death these two both wrote notes saying about how something good might come of this in that I may come to see the error of my sinful ways and know the happiness that can only come from coupling as man and woman. Of course these letters were rife with comments of loving the lord Jesus. They both dropped me as their provider, of course, because they could no longer see a doctor \"like me\", which they actually also said in these letters of \"condolence\". \n \n I was mortified. I was amazed that anyone could be so cruel. What was most galling, is one of the women had lost her husband a couple years earlier. She saw me about pain in her neck. After repeated visits, I finally discovered her neck pain was because, since the death of her husband, she could no longer sleep in the bed they shared and fell asleep in a chair every night. I realized this was about grief, not neck pain. And I saw her weekly for counseling to help her through this. After about 6 months of tearful sessions, she was finally able to grieve and managed to get a good night's sleep. I am not a counselor (she wouldn't go to one) and I saw her gratis. I found it ironic she could not even see that I had lost my husband too, and within days of his death, she informs me I am a sinner and would be better off with a woman, so his death was a blessing.",

I doubt he favors the abolition of this particular congregation. His thoughts regarding destruction of some good tissue to rid the body of that tainted is right on the mark.

I do believe much of what Matt suggests is ridiculous and I have called him on it. However, you have a tendency to assume to speak for all heterosexuals in these threads and it ticks me off. A shared trait does not mean a shared opinion. I don'y presume to speak for all blue-eyed people.\n\n \n Wrong again jito. I wasn't speaking for heteros at all. I was pointing out that statistically, we are the vast majority and if he is calling for the genocide of any group at all, it would be more humane to wipe out the homosexual rather than the religious segment of our population. I didn't suggest genocide here, matt did. I just said that based on his warped reasoning, let's be efficient and kill the smallest group possible. Isn't that more humane than Matthew's recommendation? \n \n As for you speaking for all blue eyed people, I'm glad you don't, because I'm a blue eyed arab and I don't agree with you about anything.",

So hate is as you may, you are evidence of how right I am in defining you. And regarding your inability to recognize the truth, that is obvious because of the value system you represent. But I notice you didn't post any quotes of me calling for violence or punishment against homosexuals, which would support what you are accusing me of representing. There is a huge difference between having an opinion of what you represent and calling for people or society to kill you as Matthew promoted for religious people. \n \n \nIf ALL you did was repeat \"the bible says that being gay is a moral shortcoming\", then people really wouldn't have anywhere near as much problem with you as they do.\n\n \n Sure they would, because they hate the truth I tell without compromise. You can start these threads that constantly demonize and attack what christianity represents for homosexuality, while forgetting that it's you who is practicing what is completely unnatural and goes against human nature. And you hate me for daring to remind you of THAT BIOLOGICAL FACT.\n \n \nJyoshu holds firm to \"the bible says that being gay is a moral shortcoming\".\n Steeeeve holds firm to \"the bible says that being gay is a moral shortcoming\".\n There are NUMEROUS posters who hold firm to \"the bible says that being gay is a moral shortcoming\" that don't endear the amount of animosity you generate.\n \n That's cause they don't resort to the repeated tactics you undertake.\n Whether you want to admit it or not, YOU ARE a particular problem...\n\n \n No, that isn't it at all, because when all is said and done, I say that It isn't a sin at all to be gay, it's a sin only to practice homosexuality. So I don't water it down with empty platitudes that imply that God will accept practicing homosexuals who are still actively participating in their sin. I remind you that to repent, means to turn away from, and that infuriates you you because you feel justified in your open rebellion against Gods holy principles. Beside that, what's this thread about again? Isn't it just another round about attack on christianity from the ex gay ministry point of view? You can't help but troll the internet looking for different directions to attack God from. The kronus in you is mind boggling.\n \n \n \nAnd therein lies part of the problem.\n Your overuse of such propagandic and vile terms regarding gays...\n \n Can't I just as accurately point out that \"the radical Christian agenda that is forcing itself on our youth and our society through its infiltration of our schools, our political and our social institutions\"?\n \n In reality, you have no argument there.\n Gays in politics? Geez! We're just as American as you are, and we have just as much right to be there.\n Gays in \"our social institutions\"? Who the heck established these \"social institutions\" as \"yours\" in the first place?\n Your statement has historically been used to talk about the segregation between blacks and whites. It's unconstitutional to segregate gays from the \"social institutions\" in the first place!\n\n \n More twisting and exaggerating what I actually meant, huh? Here is what I said, [Archie] Aren't my complaints focussed on the radical gay agenda that is forcing itself on our youth and our society through its infiltration of our schools, our political and our social institutions?\n So you see, I'm not condemning homosexuals who participate in our social, educational or democratic process at all. I'm condemning that this radically infused tiny minority is seeking to manipulate the larger vast majority to accept what it represents through dishonest and deceptive means by manipulating our system.\n \n \nSee, that's another problem.\n Your repeated insistence that people \"hate\" you.\n I would have to care about you in order to hate you, and I just plain don't.\n This lame \"passive-agressive\" stunt you pull in order to pretend you are the victim as you viciously attack others is rather unconvincing.\n Even people on YOUR side of the field aren't buying it.\n\n \n Don't lie foundit, if that is possible. You hate everyone who condemns what you represent and it's as evident in the tone of your posts as what you say in them. I openly admit that I hate what you represent, but the evidence of my love for you, which you will realize someday, is that I have told you only the eternal and gospel truth about what one must do to be saved. \n \n \nAnd in you go with the insults and strawman.\n I support your free speech archie.\n In fact, I use you as an example of the ugly side of anti-gay activism.\n\n \n Anti-gay activism? That proves your dishonesty and insincerity once again! All I do here is give my opinions in opposition to your attacks on me and my Lord and Savior as you attack christianity. And you call me an activist. What does it make you with these anti-christian threads you start? Of course you don't see that as anti-christian activism do you! You're a kronus to the core foundit. Get the log out of your own eye before worrying about the twig in mine.\n \n \nArchie, let me explain things to you.\n I disagree with Matt on a variety of things.\n His vehemence towards religion? I don't support it.\n In fact, by now most people here UNDERSTAND that.\n\n \n YOU'RE A LIAR FOUNDIT. Who starts most of these anti-christian threads if it isn't you? 7 out of the last 14 threads on gay rights forum were started by you and they all attacked christians from one direction or another. So don't you day imply that you remain above the fray or that Matthew is the sole problem with his anti christian hatred. This is epidemic within the radical homosexual community, which you are a card carrying member of.\n \n \nEvery time Fred Phelps says something stupid, should we all have to look to you and other Christians and insist that you repudiate it?\n No.\n\n \n And yet your side will never miss the opportunity to post the thread whenever he raises his ugly head. Another kronus foundit. You're batting a thousand today.\n \n \nI don't expect the other anti-gay posters on these threads to take up all their time disagreeing with you, cause it would be a full time job.\n Likewise, I've already disagreed with Matthew publicly plenty of times in the past. A number of the pro-gay posters have taken it upon themselves to try to get him to tone it down, much like I'm sure the anti-gay posters have done for you.\n After a while, we just write it off as a loss in that we tried to change his mind, and were unsuccessful.\n\n \n And yet here you are criticizing me while giving Matt a passing nod. How kronus of you.\n \n \nGood luck with that.\n Speaking from experience, I don't expect it to work.\n Anymore than people expect the leopard named \"Archie\" to change his spots...\n\n \n Good, because it wont happen.\n \n \n]ROFLMAO!\n We have ASKED YOU to get somebody from YOUR CHURCH to see what you write here, and you REFUSE!!!\n It's funny how you make that challenge, when you refuse to get SOMEBODY PERSONAL to you to even review your statements to see if they disagree.\n\n \n I gave this forums link to 5 guys from my monday night mens group, and to a person, they all said that I have the patience of Job to put up with this group of radical atheistic, homosexual hate mongers. And none of them considered my responses to the lies being told here to be hateful at all, but just brutally honest which they believed was needed considering the hardness of the hearts here. Remember foundit, the word of God never comes back void. \n \n \nFurthermore, you are dead wrong in your assessment.\n A MAJORITY feel that homosexuality is not something to be condemned. 57% of Americans feel that homosexuality is \"an acceptable alternative lifestyle\".\n\n http://www.gallup.com/poll/27694/Tolerance-Gay-Rights-HighWater-Mark.aspx[/QUOTE]\n \n Again, foundit, my post wasn't arguing what straights believe, but was going on the difference in the numbers of our respective communities. So if wiping out a community is the solution, then wiping out homosexuality would be the least offensive, and most efficient way to go. Using Matthew's distorted thinking of course.",

   "Woah there Billy. Are you seriously saying you think that letter wasn't harsh? You seriously see that as a nice letter to send to someone who has just lost a lover? Do you not see that this letter basically says that God took your lover so you'd come back to our church? Does that not sound nasty to you?\n\n \n Not at all. And you obviously have misunderstood the flavor of it to make that claim. Darlene obviously used this person as sent by God, as an excuse to justify going back into homosexuality, and this letter writer was making the valid point that God wouldn't use this person to call you back into homosexuality, and then take them away from you. It was an attempt to inject some common sense into her thinking as he invited her back to Exodus. His point made perfect sense too. If God did use that woman to draw Darlene back into lesbianism, then He wouldn't have then taken her through cancer. But satan would, because his goal is to destroy both of them. Darlene's girlfriend with cancer, and then Darlene with a bitter heart. \n \n \nYawn.... You're so paranoid it's unbelievable. Have you let anyone tone your abuse down? No. So why are other people suddenly responsible for Matt? I don't agree with what he says, but he has the right to say it, just as you have the right to rant continously. The point of this thread is that a letter, that I'd be very upset to recieve were I in that situation, was sent by a Christian organisation to a lesbian woman. She wasn't happy with it, and entered it into the public forum for debate. That's what's being debated here. If you're convinced that it's all a plot to attack Xianity then I truely feel sorry for you. Maybe you should try and stop Xians setting themselves up for it.\n\n \n A) I'm not paranoid about anything. And 2) This letter wasn't sent by a Christian Organization but by a personal friend who also came out of the gay experience as Darlene did. This person identifies perfectly with her experience and was speaking on a personal level to a personal friend. How typical that you would completely miss that connection in favor of condemning the writer of the letter. And speaking of paranoid, you show how thin skinned you are by not being able to get the proper context of this issue. As to the reason this thread was started, foundits track record speaks for itself.",

   "Matt said this Gazza\n \n He is calling for killing the so called good religious people in order to make sure he gets the ones he considers to be a personal threat. And we all know that his suggestion is moronic. But that doesn't mean I shouldn't build on it to show that if we were to be totally efficient in carrying out his plan, it would be only rational to wipeout homosexuals rather than the religious community which makes up a much larger segment of our Society. So my plan is far more humane then his since mine, as extreme as I agree that it would be, would only destroy around 4% of our population than Matts plan which would lead to the killing of around 60% of americans who claim a religion.\n\n \n You miss the point. My point is more basic then that. Lets suppose all your children are playing with sticks. Some are good and only use the sticks to draw in the dirt or build little houses. Others use the sticks to hit the dogs, animals, or the other children. What do you do? you can't take some of the sticks away otherwise the ones who are doing the hitting will grab the sticks of the ones playing nice.

Closing down the churches (which you said you'd support) is a whole different matter.\n \n \nWhat I object to is the adherents of any cult going round berating others for not believing thier particular brand of lunacy.

These critics really are just prejudiced against religion, period, and every now and then they slip up and let their true feelings out with things like you did about agreeing that churches should be closed down and religion outlawed.

My prejudice has a rational basis -- fear of damage. At least, that's been the historical experience, and I see nothing about human nature or the nature of religious belief that's likely to change that.\n \n If the only victims of religious credulity were the believers themselves, I'd say let them go for it, but all too often it's us non-believers who get seriously shafted. If religious institutions could keep their stuff inside their churches, they'd find a lot less hostility from non-believers.\n \n Naturally, I and the vast majority of critics of religion (certainly here) do not go so far as to argue that churches ought to be forcibly shut down -- that never works, besides being an intolerable infringement of people's rights to belief and assembly. However, religion has no right to expect to be free from criticism by non-believers when its beliefs leak over into the public square and policy, as has usually happened in the case of gays and the law.",

That doesn't make God less than omnipotent; it may simply mean that God has chosen to allow events to occur without intentionally determining that those specific events should occur. \n \n For the letter writer to presume to know why a spouse got cancer and to attribute this intent to God most certainly is insensitive; it's worse than insensitive, given the grief of the surviving spouse. \n \n Imagine your spouse got cancer and died, and I wrote a letter to you telling you that the reason she got cancer was because God was telling you that he wanted you never to have married that person, that marrying your beloved spouse in the first place was a sin. Imagine that I told you that God caused your spouse to die in order to tell you that. It would be beyond insensitive for me to do that. Such a claim on my part would be absurd, since I have no way of knowing any of this. It would all be in my head. Similarly, the guy who wrote the letter to the woman whose spouse died had no way of knowing any of what he claimed in his insensitive and wholly inappropriate letter. What he wrote was in his head, and it had nothing to do with the real life of the woman who lost her beloved spouse to cancer.",

   "Really?\n Where?\n\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=319946&postcount=108\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=319870&postcount=87\n \n \nHonestly Jyoshu, I would have thought that admitting the obvious would not be necessary.Are there any other trivial observations that I need to repeat for you, otherwise you'll believe I think the sun is green, the grass is blue, and the sky yellow?\n\n \n No, you just want the obvious admitted when it's what YOU to discuss. See, you DO seem to think the obvious is supposed to be \"admitted\" in the case of bad things sometimes coming out of religion. emoticon_xdonno Is consistency just not something you're interested in at all, here? emoticon_xdonno Tell you what ... you drop your silly insistence that people need to 'admit' obvious things when it's what YOU want focus on, and I won't ask you to admit the obvious, either. Deal? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nI find that statement incredibly false.\n Self-correction IS possible. If what you said were truly true, WHY do so many anti-gay Christians try to correct their pro-gay bretheren?\n\n \n Since when does an attempt by adherents prove that something can be successful? Have they been successful? Since YOU use the example, then we need to note that polls show more and more Christians FAVORING gay marriage, not the other way around. Obviously those ant-gay Christians didn't 'correct' anything. \n \n But more importantly, the point is really that it Christians shouldn't really HAVE to. They may be fighting injustice in OTHER ways, Foundit. Why should they necessarily have to do that in the way YOU want them to instead of putting their time and resources into others areas of in-justice (in some cases, perhaps greater in-justices to be corrected in the world)?\n \n \nIf what you claim were really true, then HOW could it ever change?\n Christianity obviously HAS changed away from supporting slavery. Changed away from supporting misogyny.\n Is it up to the atheists and other non-Christian groups alone to correct and change Christianity?\n\n \n The problem is your whole approach, Foundit, that change only comes from correction by other people. What changed pro-slavery \"Christians\" was that they realized they really could subsist without slaves, and since it was illegal it was no longer an option anyway. And frankly, probably a lot of that change is simply due to the fact that that slave-holding generation eventually died off.\n \n Christianity didn't reign in other Christians in these examples you're giving. They have no power to do that--there's no leadership over all of Christianity, any more than there's leadership over all atheists, or all gays, or all patriotic people. Again, you're approaching it like some worldwide membership where people vote on issues. It's just beliefs that people have.\n \n \nIt is no more wrong to hold Christianity responsible for its evils than it is wrong to give Christianity credit for its good.\n You CANNOT have it both ways.\n\n \n And YOU can't have it both ways, as the converse. You want a guilty till proven innocent approach rather than giving a religion the benefit of the doubt. That's your prerogative, of course, but I don't think it's the way people normally operate unless they're prejudiced against something.\n \n \nFurthermore, while I agree that you can't hold \"Christianity\" responsible for EVERY bad that Christians do, you also cannot ignore it when Christianity's EXPLICIT STATEMENTS establish the environment for that bad.\n Bible passages that are portrayed as requiring gays to be put to death, in the Old Testament.\n Bible passages that are portrayed as condemning gays throughout the bible.\n You can't just ignore that and say \"wrong approach\" when Christianity has established a REASON for its followers to treat gays badly.\n Especially when other Christians are apathetic towards the situation and/or ignore it.\n\n \n So do you hold Christianity culpable because the OT calls for adulteresses to be put to death? That it's the rest of Christianity's problem to reign it in it if something like that happens? \n \n See that's the problem here--by saying all Christians bear responsibility to correct those bad ones, there's an inherent assertion there that they are culpable. That they are responsible for them. They aren't--culpability in this case lies with those who do bad things.",

   "In theology, this is the old theodicy question: how can a loving God allow terrible things to happen to the people and creations he loves? There has been a long debate over this question, and different answers from different theologians. \n \n I think there is a difference between saying that God allowed something to happen and saying that God made something happen. God may well have created the universe to allow things to happen, which is different than saying that God intentionally made those things happen. God may allow people to get cancer without having a specific purpose in a person getting cancer. The person may simply have gotten cancer, without any intent by God in it at all. That doesn't make God less than omnipotent; it may simply mean that God has chosen to allow events to occur without intentionally determining that those specific events should occur. \n\n \n I disagree. If God put things in motion knowing people could get cancer and die (suffering too), then what we're left with is a God who, frankly, could care less about people. If a parent let his children play tag on the freeway, the parent is culpable when tragedy hits.\n \n My personal view is that God does indeed allow bad and sometimes terrible things to happen to people, and is quite aware of what's going on, but that, knowing the future and things that we can never really know, he has reasons for allowing it to happen. There's no way to prove this, of course, but it's the view I think squares the most with belief in God. With anything else, we either have a mean or disinterested God, a careless God, or no God. I'd rather deal with tragedy by just coming right out and accepting that, if there's a God who's truly God, he knows what happened and let it happen. Of course not everyone wants to approach it that way and I'm not trying to tell you how you should engage in religion.",

He should never have done that. He should have been respectful and caring for her, not focused on his own agenda.",

Frankly, the issue just isn't as pressing overall as many others because it effects much smaller groups of people, and there are much worse things going on that need the attention of Christian efforts, like world hunger. That's not to belittle your issue; it's a problem for sure. But in terms of priority, having to hear the ravings of anti-gay people is hardly comparable to things along the line of people starving to death, and many Christians do fight injustices in various ways.

   "It's really not religion's problem that you can't limit your outrage over bad religion TO bad religion rather than religion; rather it's yours. Religion will move forward with or without you changing to a fair approach, and the loss is only yours. There would be no problem if you opposed bad religion, but that's not really your approach. You admit prejudice in this area, and that's a start, though you still cling to the erroneous idea that it's rational--it's not--bigotry is never rational. The way to rise above the likes of Archangel and other prejudiced people is to look at the real problems WITHIN religion, not religion as the problem.\n\n \n I.e. you, as a religious believer, do not want to accept responsibility for the doctrines of your own religion with respect to gay people. Fine. So what, then, gives you the right to call yourself a \"Christian\", since you and your Christian churches do not seem to see eye to eye on gay people?\n \n Sorry, but my view is that it is indeed religion that is the problem, both in the type of religion most people choose to believe in, and in the apparent reality that religion exploits some of the baser instincts of the human animal. As Dawkins suggests, it can be regarded as a class of bad meme.

You remind him about 500 times in 4 months, 1 week.\n But when somebody points out that little Janey, who is actually MORE ASSOCIATED with you, has a room next to little Jimmy but is more of a slob, you start tossing out excuses on \"other work\". emoticon_rolleyes \n \n You obviously have enough time to spend bugging gays with 500 posts in 4months + 1week, but when it comes to the CHRISTIAN side of the coin, you're off doing other stuff...\n \n It's a shallow excuse!\n \n \n \nThe number of posts I put forth here has nothing to do with whether I stand up against injustices in other ways, but more importantly, that's not something I should really even have to defend, Foundit.\n\n Quite frankly, I simply made an observation that the Christians who are not \"anti-gay\" DO NOT SPEND TIME correcting their \"anti-gay\" bretheren.\n YOU took it upon yourself to argue with that observation.\n YOU decided to \"defend\".\n \n Like I said earlier, if you shouldn't \"have to defend\", then DON'T Jyoshu.\n Just STOP trying to defend it then.\n Geez.\n \n And on another level, do you realize how shallow your complaint is.\n This \"gay rights\" thread is FILLED with attacks against gays who should NOT \"have to defend\" themselves.\n But we do.\n And when even an inkling of that comes back around towards Christianity, then THAT is something you complain about... \n \n \n \nIn fact, I'm reporting these posts about posting numbers.\n\n emoticon_wow \n These threads are filled with attacks against gays.\n But me posting that is somehow a violation of TOS????\n emoticon_wow \n Once again, people fail to see who the real victims are here, and pointing out the TRUTH is not making others into victims...",

Their actions, and the negative consequences they ignore, demonstrate that they are more concerned with the pretense of their ideology than they are with the actual people they claim to \"treat\".\n REAL \"therapy\" concerns itself with the patient.

When it comes to rebuking their fellow Christian bretheren, minimal to no effort is demonstrated.\n And in some cases, that's rather remarkable (IMO).

   "But I think you are unwilling to back up your cowardly ad hominem.\n Am I wrong?\n\n \nI'm sure you can point to many posts. I'm sure you can point to a few times where serial killer has been nice to someone as well. \n\n So you being unwilling to back up your AD HOMINEM is somehow like a serial killer being nice?\n What a pathetic deflection attempt! \n \n \n \nThe point is, you consistently attack posters in each and every debate. Did you want me to name a few?\n\n I'd love to concentrate on the one we are currently talking about rather than let you side-track and continually change the issue.\n Can you point to my supposed initial \"attack\" on jyoshu?\n \n \n \nDid you want a cookie? Furthermore, you point to \"numerous posts\" of which 2 were thread creations and 1 was a response to yourself pretty much. Even I can find more posts where you haven't attacked someone. No of this is the point. \n\n I am referring to your ORIGINAL claims, which I EXPLICITLY quoted.\n Cause you say, \"never\" is easy to start with. And I just proved you wrong.\n You back-peddled.\n The next step is to start with your claims, like in THIS thread.\n \n \n \nI will honor your request here ...\n\n I made no such request.\n You are attempting to change the subject.\n You came here insistently declaring that I had \"attacked\" Jyoshu, which is false.\n You then derailed the discussion WITH YOUR OWN attacks.\n And now you want to change the subject...\n \n \n \nOther than you attacking Jyoshu in a ridiculous manner.\n\n I made no such initiating attack.\n YOU started the attacks in this thread.\n Since then, Jyoshu has attacked me, and I responded in kind.\n But YOU STARTED this crud.\n \n \n \nA debate on whether or not you attack other posters or not? What exactly are you asking me here?\n\n On your claims whereby you have since backpeddled from...\n I guess I can expect more of the same, whereas your posts to me are 100% attacks, but you'll obfuscate my supposed \"percentage\" to others..\n \n I want an HONEST discussion on your claim that I originated an \"attack\" on Jyoshu in this thread...\n Why don't you start by pointing out what you claim is the supposed \"attack\".\n Please provide a quote...",

   "A while back, Steeeeve made another categorically absurd claim...\n \n \nThese kinds of posters can't debate any way other than to attack the poster. They never provide real data to back their claim (and in the rare case they do they just post a 10 page document that has nothing to do with their claim) but instead resort to the argument \"I'm right and you are stupid\".\n\n \n At the time, I initially tried to use the \"Liar's Corner\" as a point of discussion...\n But evidently Steeeeve has to be the one to contest me calling HIM a liar on the point, and I cannot initiate the thread. Ergo, Steeeeve bounced the thread.\n \n So I continued in the \"Challengers\" forum, which Steeeeve predictably ignored.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=11006\n \n Steeeeve has habitually jumped in to do NOTHING BUT attack me, and then run away.\n In the mean-time, he is COMPLETELY DERAILING a legitimate discussion on this thread, with unsubstantiated claims that I initiated an \"attack\" on Jyoshu... emoticon_wow",
