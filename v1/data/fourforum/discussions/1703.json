It is a difference of opinion.. unless, of course, someone has rewritten the bible to include words like \"F@g\" or \"Homo\" or \"fudgepackers\" or what not. As for as I have read, there are no such words there. Just becuase someone has a difference of opinion, it does not make them bashers. That is the joy of this country. Freedom to voice a difference of opinion, as long as it's civilly done. It really and truly hurts the gay civil rights movement to be so beligerent and verbally violent against those that quote scripture. Show a little tolerance and intelligence.

That is the predominate position used in nature.\n \n \n It is curious to me that sex front to back is called \"doggy style\". Actually, dogs (in particular, I have read, wild dogs) tend to have sex back-to-back. Indeed, male dogs have a penis that has a bone in it which makes it difficult for a male dog to have sex unless his penis is pointing backwards.

Different positions, oral sex and anal sex is considered sodomy. My point was that if you condemn sodomy, you condem the heterosexual community also. And it makes for a very boring sex life. The definition of sodomy is entirely to vague to be a synonym for homosexual. Homosexuals don't have sex with animals. Heterosexuals do have oral sex and various positions. Both of these are considered sodomy by definition.\n The only \"evil\" involved in sex is when one partner is unwilling. Other than that, who is dominant or who is submissive (top or bottom), or who is doing the penetrating or being penetrated is a moot point.",

Selfishly, what a sodomizer can get from controlling a male is basically just power or wealth (but males tend to have more power than females in most societies, so that still can be something substantial)--there is no possibility for getting extra offspring directly, so the evolutionary forces encouraging sodomizing of males is less than those forces encouraging sodomizing of females.\n \n People ask the wrong question.

Usually sodomizers prefer to get control of females, because females can have (real) sex with males, and males tend to like sex. Selfishly, what a sodomizer can get from controlling a male is basically just power or wealth (but males tend to have more power than females in most societies, so that still can be something substantial)--there is no possibility for getting extra offspring directly, so the evolutionary forces encouraging sodomizing of males is less than those forces encouraging sodomizing of females.\n \n People ask the wrong question. The important question IMO is not whether homosexuality per se is wrong, but whether sodomy is wrong (but male homosexual relationships as typically defined necessarily involve sodomy, so there is a connection). Female homosexuality doesn't bother me (though I am inclined to think intelligent females tend instead to view their sexual feelings toward girls as bisexual)--just sodomy.\n\n \n It isn't about who it hurts more. It's about the definition of sodomy and how it's used to condem homosexuals. The very definition of sodomy is all sexual acts that are \"unnatural or abnormal\", including anal sex and beastiality. It depends on how far you want to take the definition of natural sex. The animal kingdom does not perform oral sex on it's partners. This would, by definition, include all types of oral sex as sodomy. And I KNOW the heterosexual community enjoys that as much as the homosexual community. The various positions that humans can enjoy in sex would also be considered abnormal or unnatural, because animals usually just have one way they do it.\n Where and how do you draw the line as to what is covered in the definition of sodomy?The legal definition (according to LegalDefinitions.com) is: \"the oral or anal sex between two people.\" There is no mention of the the sexes of the two people.",

I tend to exclude copulation involving non-human animals, not because I think bestiality is innocuous, but because it is sufficiently unrelated to sodomy as I define it as for it to deserve a separate word (which word \"bestiality\" suffices nicely). E.g., when I talk about the sodomite community, I don't want to imply that the people I am arguing against believe in bestiality (which I should think very few people believe in), and I don't want to have to say something long like the \"oral sodomy and rectal sodomy community.\" My definition seems the most useful, and apparently it agrees with the legal definition that you saw at LegalDefinitions.com, so fine. I don't like the terms \"oral sex\" and \"anal sex\" though; indeed, there is great harm in people thinking sodomy is basically sex; the terms \"oral sodomy\" and \"rectal sodomy\" are preferable, IMO. No reason to degrade sex. Not that there is any harm in defining a word a little bit non-standardly so long as you are clear about what your definition is. Such an approach is often preferable to inventing a new word or to adopting an awkwardly long phrase.",

Your causal connection between anal sex and abuse is baseless.\n\n \n Check out the thread, Sodomy a vile addiction. I just added three more reasons. I defy you or anybody else to come up with even one reason as good as any of mine to believe that sodomy is not a vile addiction.

   "To all the people who dislike gays, homosexuality, (gay bashers).\n \n Judging by what most of you have said, it seems to me and any saine person, that you clearly dislike homosexuals because it is written in the bible, or to be more clear, you intepret the bible to suit your views on the subject. You believe what you have been taught, and you never question or try to reason what you have read and been taught, brainwashing comes to mind.\n \n Then why are there so many men of the clergy being arrested and inprisoned for abusing young boys and men, all those catholic bishops etc.. Priests have been caught having sex with other men, but this is mostly kept quiet and brushed under the carpet. Now lets take away the paedophile priests, there are many gay bishops and priests. The point im trying to make is, you people take your teachings from priests and bishops and so on, who preach to you that homosexuality is wrong, and yet they practice it, now thats hypocritical and contradictory, but you still believe them, why? Brainwashed?\n \n On the other hand, if any of you gay bashers, simply dislike gays, well then its YOU who has a problem, not religion. So say it yourselves that you dont like gays and stop hiding behind some religious babble.\n \n So if any of you dont like gays its because you have a personal reason not to like them, you are either hatefull or vindictive, or you are maybe jealous that some people are happy with who they are, or it has been said, some gay bashers are gay themselves, and are either trying to hide there homosexuality by attacking homosexuals, or try to supress there feelings by hiding behind religion, or are simply weak and afraid to be who they are.",

As for people being conformist or traditional about homosexuality and other vaguely sodomy-like matters, suppose that, yes, people do tend to be especially conformist and traditional about such matters. Why would conformity here be commonplace to an unusual degree? One explanation is that if your society by and large holds a pro-sodomy or pro-male-homosexuality viewpoint, historically it doesn't really matter much what you believe because your society is doomed anyway. This doesn't suggest male homosexuality is particularly innocuous.\n \n As for why many priests are sodomizers, part of that probably stems from the celibacy requirements encouraging male homosexuality. Also, if you are a sodomizing predator, naturally you would want to go to a place like church where your position of authority and trust would make it easier to abuse. But just because some priests are sodomizers, it doesn't follow that all priests are sodomizers. On the contrary, it seems to me that much if not most of the sincere anti-male-homosexuality fight is carried on by religious groups. Church is largely and most usefully for sinners--for people who feel too screwed-up to want to choose for themselves which largely untried modern philosophy they should believe in. People with perfect faith in themselves tend to feel comfortable developing a less traditional moral viewpoint. The main usefulness of church is in reforming the addicted and those who feel screwed-up. If a church isn't against that which is screwed-up, that church is worse than useless; it's just a place for defilers to dress up their abominations in the cloak of respectability. Male homosexuals may pretend that tradition is not unusually relevant regarding homosexuality, but their clamor to warp traditional marriage to make their abominations more traditional-looking shows their deceit.\n \n All your arguments don't amount to anything. Why don't you give reasons for your believing that sodomy or homosexuality is not evil? That would be real arguments, as I have done in my \"Sodomy a Vile addiction\" thread. Surely you don't pretend that since traditionally a viewpoint similar to mine has been more common, that I have a higher burden of proof? Moreover, which definitely suggests my position is the prudent one, if I'm right, the consequences of society believing wrongly that sodomy is not evil are catastrophic, whereas if you are right, and sodomy is a kind of sexual expression, the consequences of society believing wrongly would be minimal. E.g., people with sodomizing tendencies would be encouraged to ejaculate in navels rather than in recta and throats, which if anything would help the gay community by producing a lower AIDS rate.",

By itself, therefore, a homosexual orientation cannot be considered sinful, for morality presumes the freedom to choose.\"\n \n \"God loves every person as a unique individual. Sexual identity helps to define the unique persons we are. One component of our sexual identity is sexual orientation...God does not love someone any less simply because he or she is homosexual.\" \n \n Implicit in the last two statements is the assumption that a person cannot change their sexual orientation. \n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_rom2.htm\n \n Of course, the Catholic Church states gays and lesbians must be celibate to be accepted.",

   "again you dodge the responsibility of backing your argument.\n\n Ive already stated for you a reliable source of information, your doctor. Deja vue or is it me?\n \n \n \nI never said I believe in the Bible or religion. I can base my arguments from a biblical or religious standpoint, but my personal belief in religious doctrine, the Bible, or God himself has nothing to do with whether people are born gay or not\n\n Hold on, what are you saying? You say you never stated your beliefs and your beliefs have nothing to do with it, but the you say your personal belief is in god etc has nothing to do with wether people are born gay or not. Your contradicting yourself.\n \n \n \nI have already answered this. God never creates anyones thoughts. people have free will, which allows them full liberty to form their own thoughts, convictions and behaviors.\n\n But as you say, god created them and also gave people the ability to think, if god wanted us to fly we would have feathers and wings, but he wanted us to think, so he gave us a brain and the ability to do what we like with that brain, now your suggesting we shouldnt use our brains.\n \n \nthe mere fact that everybody in the world doesnt even agree that God exists is evidence that God does not control anybody's thoughts, because if he did, then everybody would be convinced that he exists.\n\n Has it ever crossed your mind that a god, a supreme deity may not exist, maybe thats why people think for themselves, thats a rather dangerous thing to do for a supreme deity. Let me give you an example, the gods of olympus were rather real to the ancient greeks, just like your supreme deity is real to you, those gods gave their subjects the abilty to think for themselves and now hardly anybody believes in those gods. So i dont think any supreme deity is foolish enough to give its creations or subjects the freedom to think for themselves as they might disobey him.\n \n \nyou have produced no proof or logic to support your claim that God creates people's thoughts\n\n No i havent produced any proof or evidence that god creates peoples thoughts, because i cant prove that a god exists to create peoples thoughts.\n I tell you what, if you prove a supreme deity exists, then i will ask him/her if they create peoples thoughts, in fact, we can ask together.",

I disagree with him when he says that onions are tasty. Therefore, I am an intolerant bigot because I don't like onions. However, he is also an intolerant bigot because he doesn't agree with me on the subject either. Under your rule, no one in the world has any tolerance for anyone, because everyone has a disagreement with everyone else in the world on some level, no matter how small. Hmmm...\n \n \n \nThere is nothing in the Christian faith that allows tolerance. It is a religion based on fear. Thou shalt not do this, thou shalt not do that. It tells you many things that you should not do, and it gives punishments for those actions. This does not breed tolerance for anything that is outside your set of beliefs.\n\n \n Wow. I think it was Jesus said to love your enemies. That sounds like tolerance. I think it was Jesus who hung out with prostitutes, tax-collectors, etc. when the Pharisees and Saducees would not. It is the true Christian church that welcomes all people into its arms, no matter what they have done before. That sounds like tolerance. \n \n Jesus sought to save men from their sins. Christianity teaches good morals and ethics. It does not teach to hate. It teaches discipline. It teaches that it is wrong to have sex with anyone and at anytime you want. It teaches that you should love your neighbor as yourself and lay down your life for your fellow man. It teaches that you sometimes have to pay a price for what is good and true in this world. People don't like hearing that, so they balk and call it intolerance. \n \n \n \nTo a christian, buddhism is wrong, muslim is wrong, everything outside the christian faith is wrong.\n\n \n That is true.\n \n \nYou seek to convert these people. That is not being tolerant of them.\n\n \n Wrong. Jesus said He was the only way to God. As C.S. Lewis said (I will paraphrase here), Jesus was either a madman, a liar, or exactly what He claimed to be. I believe He is who He claimed to be. Therefore, as a Christian, I have an obligation to God and to you to inform you of the saving grace of God. I CAN'T NOT tell you about Him. If I do, I am disobeying my Lord's commandments and I am doing you a diservice by never giving you the chance to hear of Him and the miracles He has performed in my life. That's not intolerance. That is love, my friend.\n \n \nAnd yes, people have murdered homosexuals in the name of christianity. You don't have to show violence to someone to prove your intolerance. You just have to actively try and change that person to your views.\n\n \n Wait, is it the process of trying to convert someone that makes me intolerant, or is it simply the belief a person is wrong? You say above that believing someone is wrong constitutes intolerance. Now you say that intolerance is the attempt to convert. Not that it matters, I guess, because neither action is intolerance.",

He was born that way and nothing can change him. :)\n \n I assume that you disagree with unkerpaulie's insightful arguement that, if God didn't give us free will, we would all beleive in him. It seems to me, given that arguement, there is either no God in this world, or there is a God who gave us free will. Do you agree? If God makes everything, including our actions, then why do people not beleive in Him? Why do people swear at Him and blaspheme Him? Why do people murder?\n \n \n Thats the point, why is it a sin? Just because a book says it is? thats no reason to label homosexuals as sinners. Like i said before to unkerpaulie, people are born gay, they dont wake up one morning and say, oohhh today im going to be gay, thats the way god made them, if you believe in god that is. The bible says many things but you dont follow them to the letter, but people conveniently use this when they dislike gays, its no good saying christianity loves the sinner, clearly it doesnt otherwise it would not be mentioned in he bible.\n\n \n I would like to point out that the Bible \"labels\" everyone as sinners. (\"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\" -in Romans)\n \n Although I beleive that there may be genetic and environmental factors which predispose a person towards homosexuality, and that they don't up and decide to be gay, I disagree very much that there is no choice or possibility for change. Many formerly gay people agree with me.\n \n It is true that we don't follow the bible to the letter. However, it may be of interest to you to know what else is outlawed in Leviticus...\n \n \"Leviticus 18\n \n ...20You shall not have sexual relations with your kinsman's wife, and defile yourself with her. 21You shall not give any of your offspring to sacrifice them to Molech, and so profane the name of your God: I am the LORD. 22You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. 23You shall not have sexual relations with any animal and defile yourself with it, nor shall any woman give herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it: it is perversion...\n \n Leviticus 20\n \n ... 11The man who lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness; both of them shall be put to death; their blood is upon them. 12If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall be put to death; they have committed perversion, their blood is upon them. 13If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death; their blood is upon them. 14If a man takes a wife and her mother also, it is depravity; they shall be burned to death, both he and they, that there may be no depravity among you. 15If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he shall be put to death; and you shall kill the animal. 16If a woman approaches any animal and has sexual relations with it, you shall kill the woman and the animal; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.... \"\n \n ( http://www.ambs.edu/LJohns/Homosexuality.htm ) - a mennonite individual's thourough review of homosexuality in the Bible. I find it especially interesting that the author says homosexual tendency or orientation are not and cannot be sin. It is the act of homosexuality which is condemned.\n \n Incest and bestiality are both condemned in the same passage as homosexual acts. I suggest that one of the main reasons these things are not promoted by our society is the Judeo-Christian influence. It seems to me that the foundation of our society lies in the Bible.\n \n I agree that Christianity doesn't support gay-bashing. I don't really know about other religions.",

It is the act of homosexuality which is condemned.\n\n \n Right. Would it seem fair to you if said I do not condemn Christians, I condemn any act associated with Christianity? Your being a Christian is okay with me. Just never practice your Christianity, and I have no problem with you. I am not hateful to you because you are a Christian, I am only hateful toward your Christianity(in particular any expression of it). \n \n Actually, didn't a Christian say on another thread that Christians don't look at Leviticus? Anyway, here is more from Leviticus....\n \n Open Letter To 'Dr.' Laura\n Laura Schlessinger is a US radio personality who dispenses sex advice to people who call in to her radio show. Recently, she said that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22 and cannot be condoned in any circumstance. The following is an open letter to 'Dr.' Laura penned by a US resident, which was posted on the Internet:\n \n Dear Dr. Laura:\n Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your radio show, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.\n \n I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific Bible laws and how to follow them. \n a) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them? \n b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her? She's 18 and starting University. Will the slave buyer continue to pay for her education by law? \n c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense. I'm sure you have found a way to do this and can share it with me.\n d) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?\n e) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should this be a neighborhood improvement project?\n f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?\n g) Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here? Would contact lenses help?\n h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27. How should they die?\n i) I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear hemp gloves?\n j) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev.24:10-16) Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)\n I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.\n Your devoted disciple and adoring fan,\n J. Kent Ashcroft (author of the original version)",

Deja vue or is it me?\n \n I asked you, you say ask my doctor. thats dodging the question. if you dont know the answer, then say so\n \n Hold on, what are you saying? You say you never stated your beliefs and your beliefs have nothing to do with it, but the you say your personal belief is in god etc has nothing to do with wether people are born gay or not. Your contradicting yourself.\n \n this is not contradicting my self. if people are not born gay they are not born gay. if I have person beliefs I have personal beliefs. the 2 have nothing to do with each other\n \n But as you say, god created them and also gave people the ability to think, if god wanted us to fly we would have feathers and wings, but he wanted us to think, so he gave us a brain and the ability to do what we like with that brain, now your suggesting we shouldnt use our brains.\n \n did I ever say people shouldnt think??? show me one post where I said people shouldnt think and I will take back all the negative remarks to you in this post\n \n Has it ever crossed your mind that a god, a supreme deity may not exist, maybe thats why people think for themselves, thats a rather dangerous thing to do for a supreme deity. Let me give you an example, the gods of olympus were rather real to the ancient greeks, just like your supreme deity is real to you, those gods gave their subjects the abilty to think for themselves and now hardly anybody believes in those gods. So i dont think any supreme deity is foolish enough to give its creations or subjects the freedom to think for themselves as they might disobey him.\n \n has it crossed your mind that whether people believe in God or not does not make a difference to his existence? people can think for themselves. so they can decide what they want to believe. I want to explain how disobedience works, but youu have a track record of gross misunderstanding, so I'll leave it at that\n \n No i havent produced any proof or evidence that god creates peoples thoughts, because i cant prove that a god exists to create peoples thoughts.\n \n You were the one that say God creates people's thoughts so God made people behave gay. now you cannot back up your statement. I never said God exists, or that God had anything to do with gays. read this very slowly, like about 5 times: I SAID PEOPLE ARE NOT BORN GAY!!!!!. keep repeating it until it sticks. you see anything with God in that statement???\n \n I tell you what, if you prove a supreme deity exists, then i will ask him/her if they create peoples thoughts, in fact, we can ask together.\n Im done with you",

   "I wasn't referring to your church rules, I asked about rules in the bible. That's what you quoted on the gay issue which, by the way, comes from the old testament too.\n\n My bad... homosexuality is wrong based on the Bible. the New Testament as well as the old makes this clear:\n \n Leviticus 18:22 & 23 - You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. And you shall not lie with any beast and defile yourself with it, neither shall any woman give herself to a beast to lie with it: it is perversion.\n \n obviously here God specifically condemns homosexuality and bestiality, as well as defines them as what is considered a \"perversion\"\n \n Corinthians 6:9 & 10 - Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor sexual perverts, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God.\n \n here the word \"pervert\" is mentioned, specifically \"sexual pervert\". to you this may be too indirect, but it seems to me that sexual perversion (including homosexuality and bestiality) is against the kingdom of God. \n \n I cannot see how these statements can be \"interpreted\" any other way, but I'm open to any opinions. as far as I see, though, the Bible shows disapproval to homosexuality in both the old and new testament",

   "Dictionary.com is a great place. I got the same definition.\n \n \n \n Let's say I have a twin brother. We are exactly alike in almost all respects, physically, mentally, spiritually, philisophically, etc. However, he likes onions, and I don't like onions. I disagree with him when he says that onions are tasty. Therefore, I am an intolerant bigot because I don't like onions. However, he is also an intolerant bigot because he doesn't agree with me on the subject either. Under your rule, no one in the world has any tolerance for anyone, because everyone has a disagreement with everyone else in the world on some level, no matter how small. Hmmm...\n \n \n \n \n Wow. I think it was Jesus said to love your enemies. That sounds like tolerance. I think it was Jesus who hung out with prostitutes, tax-collectors, etc. when the Pharisees and Saducees would not. It is the true Christian church that welcomes all people into its arms, no matter what they have done before. That sounds like tolerance. \n \n Jesus sought to save men from their sins. Christianity teaches good morals and ethics. It does not teach to hate. It teaches discipline. It teaches that it is wrong to have sex with anyone and at anytime you want. It teaches that you should love your neighbor as yourself and lay down your life for your fellow man. It teaches that you sometimes have to pay a price for what is good and true in this world. People don't like hearing that, so they balk and call it intolerance. \n \n \n \n \n That is true.\n \n \n \n Wrong. Jesus said He was the only way to God. As C.S. Lewis said (I will paraphrase here), Jesus was either a madman, a liar, or exactly what He claimed to be. I believe He is who He claimed to be. Therefore, as a Christian, I have an obligation to God and to you to inform you of the saving grace of God. I CAN'T NOT tell you about Him. If I do, I am disobeying my Lord's commandments and I am doing you a diservice by never giving you the chance to hear of Him and the miracles He has performed in my life. That's not intolerance. That is love, my friend.\n \n \n \n Wait, is it the process of trying to convert someone that makes me intolerant, or is it simply the belief a person is wrong? You say above that believing someone is wrong constitutes intolerance. Now you say that intolerance is the attempt to convert. Not that it matters, I guess, because neither action is intolerance.\n\n \n Yes, by the definition of tolerance, any attempt to change a person's beliefs or actions is considered intolerance. It is a wonderful thought to think all Christians love the person but not the sin. Most people can not differentiate between the two. Everything in this society is compared to a standard of actions. Actions are what define us. \n You are not an intolerant bigot for voicing a different opinion. You are intolerant when you tell your brother that he must stop eating onions becuase they will send him to hell. That is intolerance. Forcing or cajoling someone into changing what they do becuase you think they are wrong. You can still like the person, or even love them, but affection has nothing to do with tolerance.\n I'm at a loss for how you think Christianity doesn't teach hate. The Israelites were told by God on several occasions to commit genocide becuase the people were sinners. Entire peoples were destroyed down to their very cattle. Look to Sodom and Ghomorrah, look to Jericho. Tell me this was done out of love. Forcing a people to wander the wilderness for an entire generation of people for dancing around a golden calf is a little extreme. I'm not seeing love there. If it is, I don't want any part of that. There is nothing loving about Revelations. Destroying so may lives in the end times doesn't show love. It's very much like the Inquisition. Believe as I say, do as I say, or you will experience eternal damnation. Show me where the love is in that?",

You say homosexuality is wrong, therefore gays are being disobedient, thats your view of disobedience, THATS UNKERPAULIES PERSONAL VIEW.\n \n \nbut youu have a track record of gross misunderstanding, so I'll leave it at that\n\n Well thats nice i at least have a reputation for misunderstanidng, where as you have a reputation for evading akward questions and then denying you did. you avoid questions you cannot answer, then you assume others did not understand you.\n \n \n \nYou were the one that say God creates people's thoughts so God made people behave gay. now you cannot back up your statement. I never said God exists, or that God had anything to do with gays. read this very slowly, like about 5 times: I SAID PEOPLE ARE NOT BORN GAY!!!!!. keep repeating it until it sticks. you see anything with God in that statement???\n\n You call yourself religios and then you state you never said you believe in god, contradicting yourself yet again. If you dont believe in god why dont you say so, but you cant can you, because if you did you wouldnt have anything to hide behind. Which means that you are a HOMOPHOBE. \n \n \nIm done with you\n\n It seems you are, theres no point in continuing if you continually keep contradicting yourself, you have quoted the bible many times, you have used religion as an excuse to promote your views, then when challenged on that, you change your comments by saying, \"i said people are not born gay\". Then you try and deny using religion.\n \n Whichever way you look at it YOU have a problem with gay people.\n 1)Why continually insist, people are not born gay, when theres overwhelming evidence to prove they are.\n 2)Why quote the bible and using it to say homosexuals are immoral and sinners.\n 3)Why, when i asked you not to hide behind religion, you avoided the question and suddenly change what you have been saying all along.\n \n Please understand that this is nothing personal for me, and you are perfectly entitled to your beliefs and views, i just think that your views and beliefs are wrong.",

   "Many gay and lesbian people resent this attempt at recruitment. How do you feel one would go about \"changing\"? There's no proof that programs which teach gay men to play sports and read the Bible are effective at permanently changing a gay male's identity. Many former Christians would agree that Christians can change too. \n\n \n Recruitment? I beleive it is possible that there are some organizations trying to \"recriut\" gays, but I don't think they are the norm. What exactly do you mean by recruitment? Advertisements? \n \n I meant programs that are there for homosexuals to choose, to seek out if they wish to change. If you wish, I'll provide some links to individual testimonies or studies on the subject.\n \n \nWait. I'm a gay man who has never lain with a woman, only with a man... Again, I have not lain with a woman, only with a man. If you believe this applies to gay men, do you advocate gay men be put to death? Perhaps only those who are proud, acting, and not hiding alone in an attic(or closet) in shame? \n\n \n I wonder if gays who are \"in the attic\" resent your insinuation that they are weak and live shameful lives. Perhaps they dislike the recruitmental spirit of others who want them to be like them?\n \n You have a very good point. However, I did not mean to advocate strict following of Old Testament law. I think that a lot of it is remarkably progressive but my purpose was to say that many of our laws and attitudes are based and began with the law of Moses. Things like incest, bestiality, and homosexuality have not been generally accepted in our society because of that Judeo-Christian tradition. It may be that we now have independant reasons for continuing to dissaprove and be \"intolerant\" towards people who advocate incest and bestiality. For instance, we know that the mix of closely related genes increases genetic disease very much. However, I don't see this as a compelling reason to \"repress\" incest advocators, since we now have the options of contraceptives, condoms, and ultimately abortion. Can you think of some independant reason that we should deny rights to incestuous couples? I'm not sure that I can. Perhaps it simply is likely an unhealthy relationship. But if its two consenting adults, why should we \"legislate morality\" and deny them the same rights as a non-related, married couple. (marriage) They may even have a more logically compelling case since they were clearly born with their family relation, while it is subject to debate whether homosexuality is an innate condition. If we say that they can change their desires to someone they aren't related to, we are being just as \"intolerant\" as if we were saying homosexuals ought to change.\n \n It used to be that most people agreed that these things were simply wrong. I'm pretty sure that most people still agree that it is wrong. But they are \"intolerant\". They don't count. It used to be that people felt it in their hearts (and many still do) and it was in the Bible after all. But the Bible is \"intolerant\"... it doesn't count.\n \n That is what I'm driving at. If the Bible and especially Tradition don't count anymore, what does? What arguement do we have against incest? Polygamy? I don't know.\n \n The words I have in quotes above are all used to argue for equal treatment and recognition for homosexuality. They can all be used to argue for equal treatment of incest as well as polygamy. Yet the thought of incest and polygamy are still repungant to many people. Why is that? I think its argueable that polygamy represents a more radical change to the institute of marriage that equalized homosexuality does. Polygamy is prevalent in many cultures, and supported by some religions as well. Historically there has always been the family. For much, if not most, of that history polygamy has been an accepted form of the family. Has homosexuality ever been there? I'm confident that it hasn't. It wouldn't make sense - marriage is so important because it represents the continuation of society through children. (some may argue that artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, or adoption would validate homosexual marriage, and that is a subject for another debate) So, again, why has homosexuality made such inroads in our culture?\n \n I would argue that a newly popular idea is the reason; the idea that all personal beleifs, and therefore lifestyles are morally equal - there is no absolute truth. Thus, positive tolerance - which seems to be what we mean by \"tolerance\" these days. It is the idea that all beliefs (and lifestyles) should be equally accepted rather than equally tolerated. Tolerance used to mean \"I don't have a right to forcibly change your beliefs; the Government should protect all people equally regardless of religion\" - I beleive that the US was the first country that didn't require government officials to have a particular religious beleif. Now tolerance means that everyone should treat everyone exactly the same regardless of beliefs. Hence, the Boy scouts are \"intolerant\" for not allowing openly gay men as troop leaders, and religions are \"intolerant\" for not accepting other's beliefs and actions as equal. This particular topic has been well covered earlier in this thread. \n \n So with moral relativism, and with organized, effective activists, our culture's resistance has partially broken down. And my contention is that it can and will happen with other things such as incest and polygamy. It won't be because of a liberal and thoughtful consideration of these activities and their pros and cons to society. It is through unthinking adherance to the dogma of \"tolerance\" that actually prohibits liberal thinking through Political Correctness. It is through judges making and changing laws with or without the support of the people. It is through the doctrine that Tradition is repressive and we should get rid of it. Equality is the new goal - whether or not people and lifestyles are all equal.\n \n \n Right. Would it seem fair to you if said I do not condemn Christians, I condemn any act associated with Christianity? Your being a Christian is okay with me. Just never practice your Christianity, and I have no problem with you. I am not hateful to you because you are a Christian, I am only hateful toward your Christianity(in particular any expression of it). \n\n \n As far as that goes, I feel that you have a right to despise the expression of my belief. If that were, however, to lead to actions prohibiting the expression of my belief it would violate the principal of tolerance. Perhaps gay sex should be tolerated if the participants are consenting adults on private property. I think that is what tolerance really means. Then again, tolerance was origionally focused on religious beleifs and a distinction was made between beleifs and actions. That was the conclusion when it was claimed that prohibiting polygamy was prohibiting religous expression. They decided that \"separation of church and state\" didn't apply to the action of polygamy:\n \n \n In 1878 there was a case called 'Reynolds vs. United States'. In this case, in which polygamy was condemned by the courts, the argument was that government was interfering with religious expression. In other words, the U.S. government had no right to prohibit polygamy, since it was a form of religious expression by a certain group.\n \n The court did not agree, and referred to Thomas Jefferson's letter as proof that the 1st Amendment did allow the government to interfere when religious expression violated social order and subverted moral behavior. Here they quoted President Jefferson's letter in its entirety and concluded:\n \n \"Coming as this does from an acknowledged leader of the\n advocates of the measure, it (Thomas Jefferson's letter) may\n be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the \n scope and effect of the Amendment thus secured. Congress\n was deprived of all legislative power over mere (religious)\n opinion, but was left free to reach actions which were in\n violation of social duties or subversive of good order.\"23\n \n\n \n ( http://www.christianamerica.com/ijl.htm )\n \n It isn't automatically wrong to oppose someone's actions, even the government can oppose an action an individual claims to be religiously motivated. \n \n And if you beleived sincerely that my expression of Christianity was downright wrong, that it would cause me harm, and you decided to accept it, I would wonder whether you were afraid to speak out or you just didn't care about me. \n \n Christians need to take a close look at the life of Christ. He forgave and loved people the Pharisees wouldn't look at. It was because He cared about them that he didn't tolerate their lifestyle. I'm so sorry that christians come across to many as hateful - that many christians are hateful.\n \n \nActually, didn't a Christian say on another thread that Christians don't look at Leviticus? Anyway, here is more from Leviticus.... \n\n \n That is mostly true. Most people I know say that we should read all of the Bible, but no one I know or have heard of practices it to the letter. I can't read the Old Testament without my stomach turning once in a while. Yet, savage as it seems in places, it is arguable that it was remarkable for the times. For example, a thief had to pay back fourfold or was sold into slavery if he couldn't afford that. On every sixth year slaves were given the option of freedom. In contrast to that, many other cultures still have the death penalty for stealing. Human sacrifice was in no way allowed. It's an interesting topic. As an aside, the Old Testament is a lot more than what we now consider repressive law. The Psalms are very beautiful in places, considered by many to be extremely high literature. I was rather stunned to see Solomon say in Proverbs that a person should do good to their enemies. I had thought that was a purely New Testament idea. I have read stories of people who converted to Christianity simply because of the practicality and accuracy of the Bible. One man had decided to take a look at different religious books historical accuracy in order to be sure that they were all wrong as he expected. He couldn't find a single undoubtable error in the entire Bible, despite spending an hour a day for several months on it. He was especially impressed by Genesis's creation account, which he found to be uniquely accurate and beleivable.\n \n Still, you are right that the Christian doesn't recognize the law of Moses as something that should be followed closely:\n \n \nAccording to the Gospel of John, the Pharisees, in an attempt to discredit Jesus, brought a woman charged with adultery before him. Then they reminded Jesus that adultery was punishable by stoning under Mosaic law and challenged him to judge the woman so that they might then accuse him of disobeying the law. Jesus thought for a moment and then replied, \"He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone at her.\" The people crowded around him were so touched by their own consciences that they departed. When Jesus found himself alone with the woman, he asked her who were her accusers. She replied, \"No man, lord.\" Jesus then said, \"Neither do I condemn thee: go and sin no more.\" \n\n \n ( http://www.bartleby.com/59/1/lethimwhoisw.html )",

   "Plotter, I disagree with your point that:\n \n A) Religion says God created everything, therefore there is no such thing as sin according to that beleif\n \n B) Therefore people who say that a particular religion thinks that the homosexual lifestyle is wrong are really just using religion to \"bash gays\" because they hate gay people. (in particular, you accuse unkerpaulie of this)\n \n Actually, this resembles what is probably the longest held and most persuasive opposition to beleif in an all-powerful and all-good God. If God is good, and all-powerful, then why is there evil? I don't presume to be able to answer here, although you might try \"Mere Christianity\" by C.S. Lewis. \n \n However, your assertion that religions beleive that there is no such thing is as free-will - that God created such things as murder and has no problem with them - is easily refuted, and has been:\n \n \n To claim that it is \"ok\" to do something becuase god made everyone breeds anarchy. God made Hitler, Pol Pot, and serial killers. They are still wrong, and evil. According to Christianity, God does not have a problem with people, only actions considered sin. He can forgive and does forgive all sins, but the idea is to learn from your mistakes, and not commit it again. According to the King James version of the Bible (and various other translations), being homosexual IS a SIN. \n\n \n \n It is not contradictory. Just becuase he created something, that does not mean you have to partake of it. He gave us free will to do as we see fit. Then he gave guidelines to live by, or we would be a Nietzian society. Only the strongest, most brutal and ruthless people would survive. Humanity as forever strived for ascension of some sort. Religion gives that. It is interesting that mankind has always worshiped something or someone. I am not saying that Christianity is correct, but I do believe there is a higher power of some sort out there that is guiding and teaching us every breath we take. I do understand the Christian point of view (14 years of Bible school), although I do not follow that path. According to that point of view, homosexuality is wrong.\n\n \n \n if religion believed that everything created was all good then there would be no religion. religion is about self constraint and discipline to not do certain things, or do things differently. of course God created marijuana, tobacco, alcohol producing agents, materials to make drugs, nuclear weapons, and whatever else people consider evil. but religion is about choosing to not do everything. religion accepts everyone, not everything \n\n \n \n The very design of religion oposes anarchy. There is nothing in Christianity that say it is ok to murder. Just as there is nothing in Christianity that says homosexuality is ok. Actions are condemned, not races of people. Being gay doesn't make you a seperate race of people. It is a lable given to people who do certain actions. Those actions (according to Christianity) are sin. A common phrase amongst some Christians is \"Hate the sin, love the sinner\". By trying to teach you what they believe, they are trying to stop the sin, but save the sinner. \n\n \n It is clear that Christianity and other religions do in fact beleive that there is such thing as right and wrong. Read the Bible, and you will see that it is talking all the time about right and wrong.\n \n People aren't \"hiding behind religion\" when they say that the Bible opposes homosexuality",

LOL. .....Gay people come from all walks of life and there are millions -- more than the statistics say because many still remain in \"the closet\" and even those who are \"out\" are not counted -- someone show me evidence of \"counted\" homosexuals. \n \n I just hope the gay people reading these forum threads will stand up for themselves and trust that the future can be theirs to live safe and free just like the rest of this nation.",

   "I am not bashing gays but they seem to want to rub it in everybodies face. Many people are uncomfortable with this. They don't want to walk around and see two people of the same sex holding hands. It makes a lot of people sudder when thinking about it. I don't care as long as it is in the confines of their own home. And they don't put GSA posters above the urinal.\n\n \n Yesterday I saw a good looking guy holding hands with a really really fat, ugly chick. Thinking about it makes me shudder, because he obviously has a sexual preference that I do not share.\n \n I don't think the couple were rubbing peoples noses in it, I don't think they should confine their affections to their own home, I don't think that they should feel in anyway restricted to act in such a way in their own country. And y'know if they joined an organisation that celebrated ugly love, I really don't think I'd be bothered by it no matter where they put their posters.\n \n People have different tastes, get over it.",

   "Sir, you missed the entire point. The very definition of sodomy includes all versions of sex that is \"unnatural\" or \"abnormal\". Different positions, oral sex and anal sex is considered sodomy. My point was that if you condemn sodomy, you condem the heterosexual community also. And it makes for a very boring sex life. The definition of sodomy is entirely to vague to be a synonym for homosexual. Homosexuals don't have sex with animals. Heterosexuals do have oral sex and various positions. Both of these are considered sodomy by definition.\n The only \"evil\" involved in sex is when one partner is unwilling. Other than that, who is dominant or who is submissive (top or bottom), or who is doing the penetrating or being penetrated is a moot point.\n\n \n IMHO...I think, personally, that it is faulty to try and define heterosexuality or homsexuality via sexual acts. Sodomy does not = homosexuality. Regardless of how we look at it, it is a faulty formula. \n \n MC",

   "That is ridiculous. Quoting the bible is not gay bashing. It is a difference of opinion.. unless, of course, someone has rewritten the bible to include words like \"F@g\" or \"Homo\" or \"fudgepackers\" or what not. As for as I have read, there are no such words there. Just becuase someone has a difference of opinion, it does not make them bashers. That is the joy of this country. Freedom to voice a difference of opinion, as long as it's civilly done. It really and truly hurts the gay civil rights movement to be so beligerent and verbally violent against those that quote scripture. Show a little tolerance and intelligence. If they wish to live by outdated guidelines and fantastic tales then they have the freedom to do so.\n\n ===============\n As a Christian, I think that many times, our address of homosexuality via Scripture has taken on the form equiavalent of gay bashing or bigotry against homosexuals. Why?\n \n We (generalizing about contermporary US Christianity - more or less talking about Evangelical America and mainline Protestantism) have used the Bible to somehow single out or draw special attention to homosexuality and imply that it is somehow a special, particularly terrible aspect of human sinfulness that deserves specific judgement and intolerance.\n \n There is nothing that I have found, in scripture, to warrant any special pointing out of, hatred of, or singling out of homosexuality apart from any other aspect of our human sinfulness. If I am accepting of liars, cheats, backbiters, slanderers amidst my community and my church family, why should I somehow kick out the gays? \n \n I don't think we should.\n \n MC",
