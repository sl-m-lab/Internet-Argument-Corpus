   "Clear and sophisticated thinkers remain consistently wary of the influences that put them at risk for magical thinking, always cognizant that why they believe what they do is influenced by so many things besides their reasoning minds:\n \nWhat their parents taught them from an early age.\n What they want to believe is true.\n What their experience suggests should be true.\n\n\n Magical Thinking | Psychology Today\n \n I've got to give my parents credit for being mighty smart people, In fact, they were so smart they always made it clear that they were not God Almighty and omniscient, or all-knowing.\n \n I'd like to believe that I'm a multimillionaire, but sadly it ain't true and I can't spend money like I'm that rich.\n \n My folks always taught me to be skeptical and to take a second or third look at things that appear to be so, because \"appearances can be deceiving.\"\n \n And, my dad was a skeptical guy who was born in Sweden and was probably better educated than most Americans even if he didn't go much beyond the eighth grade. He didn't believe one damned thing that was said in America until he checked it out to make sure that the guy knew what the heck he was talking about.\n \n I learned at a very early age that the air in America is filled with BS and to figure out that most of the stuff I heard and read was dead wrong, unless I knew that the speaker was a reliable source.\n \n And sadly, after Rupert Murdoch came to town, the level of BS in the US has gotten monstrously high",
