Oh I know, just tack it on to the bottomless war budget.\n\n \n Mercenary military forces have always been far more expensive than conscription, but when you're shoving it down the throat of a public that has been ingrained with fear of the latest menace and revels in personal debt while chasing the illusionary American Dream, they don't blink an eye at grossly abnormal public debt. Public math deficiencies are widespread.",

It was not the US that brought down the soviet union, it was the fact that they were spending such s high percentage of GDP on their military. In the end, it was not the allies that defeated germany, but rather the fact that they could not, while at war, exploit the resources of the regions they invaded sufficiently to cover their military spending. \n \n The problme is that only a very small amount of total military spending goes to payroll. The vast majorty goes to pay for equipment, bombs, fuel cots, etc...",

There's also the hint of a pyramid scheme as enlistment enticement goodies grow ever grander while veteran benefits are steadily reduced.",

   "That a war-based economy doesn't work was first documented a very long time ago.\n \n The ancient Spartans devoted what might be called the entire \"GDP\" of their day to maintaining an army for the only activity they cared about - ceaseless conquest.\n \n At the same time, the material poverty of Spartan life was notorious and this was recognised at the time as an inevitable consequence of permanent mobilization.\n \n Even ancient history occasionally throws up a useful lesson for the present day (or am I kidding myself ?)",

It adds nothing to the economy to have the government buy it rather than the individual.\n \n Very few pieces of US ordinance and very few of the supplies we use are wholly made int eh US. Most are assembeled in the US from components made in other coutries (i.e cruise missiles, in which onley the explosive charge and a portion of the engine is made int he US, everything else is made abroad and then assembeled here).\n \n Ordanance, the largest portions of military expenditures, is a net loss. we spend $200 million on a cruise missile, then blow it up. From an economic standpoint, you could burn that $200 million in a field and have the same net effect on your economy, which is negative. Fuel for transportation is the same deal.\n \n This is why during WWII, US debt went through the roof. Building things to be destroyed is a negative from an economic standpoint.",
