   "SCOTUS radicals Kennedy, Roberts, Alito, Scalia and Thomas have just opened the door wide for foreign manipulation of our election and campaign process in their Citizens United v. FEC decision:\n \nThe ruling essentially gives corporations the same rights as individuals in their ability to spend freely on political advertising, even if those advertisements explicitly advocate the election or defeat of a federal candidate. This means that candidates who support, say, increased restrictions on tobacco products could find themselves up against the corporate treasury of say, a major American tobacco company. And even the fear of $10 million in attack ads blanketing the airways come re-election time may give sitting legislators pause before taking on moneyed industries.\n \n But it's one thing for U.S. firms to have their say. What about foreign companies that operate U.S. subsidiaries? Many of these, like American businesses, are owned by ordinary shareholders - but a host of others are owned, in whole or in part, by the foreign governments themselves.\n \n One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company - once the American-born Cities Services Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan government-owned Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens United ruling could conceivably allow Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized both of the past two U.S. presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an American political candidate, just by having CITGO buy TV ads bashing his target.\n\n The Center for Public Integrity | Latest from the Center - Will the Citizens United Ruling Let Hugo Chavez and King Abdullah Buy U.S. Elections?\n \n According to Justice John Paul Stevens who dissented with the Radical Five:\n \nIn his dissent in Citizens United, Justice John Paul Stevens cautioned that the decision \"would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations controlled by foreigners as to individual Americans.\"\n\n Supreme Court Empowers Foreign Governments to Sway Federal Elections? The Washington Independent\n \n Good bye! America! The greedy savages within have finally destroyed you.",
