These are the facts:\n The World Health Organization ranks the United States as #37\n The World Health Organization's ranking of the world's health systems\n \n Mirror, Miror on the Wall has concluded that\n \"The U.S. ranks last overall across the five dimensions of a high performance health system.\"\n \"On indicators of efficiency, the U.S. scores last overall with poor performance on the two measures of national health expenditures, as well as on measures of the use of IT and multi-disciplinary teams.\"\n %GDP: U.S. 15.3% vs. Germany 10.9%\n Administartive cost: U.S. 7.3 % vs. Germany 5.6%\n http://www.commonwealthfund.org/usr_doc/1027_Davis_mirror_mirror_international_update_final.pdf\n \n There are 46 million uninsured in the U.S.\n \n Universal health care exists in Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Israel.\n =====================================================================\n \n I would like to know if the opponents of health care reform dispute these facts.\n If not do they agree that the system needs fixing.\n If so, what exactly is wrong with the plan before the Congress.\n \n In particular what is wrong with the provision that the insurance companies cannot reject you because of pre-existing condition and that they cannot drop you in the middle of treatment because of technicality?\n \n What is wrong with eliminating waste?
