   "Well, Obama's choice for president is...Obama.\n \n And, UNLESS obama topples over dead...well have exaclty what you said about Palin for president.\n \n That said, I will agree that I was floored over McCain's 'radical' choice.\n I do believe he's trying hard to pull the air out of Obama's sails. And the past 2 days at the DNC were (even to this hard hearted fascist) awesome.\n Bill Clinton's speech was a masterpiece of political showmanship. Hillary side-stepping the roll call and unifying behind Obama was also skilled.\n \n McCain had to do something. I liked his 'good for you obama' TV ad last night. \n As to Palin. She's there to unify the GOP base. Look pretty, spout off the party line, have the 'oh poor me, I'm like Michelle Obama only better as I have more kids and one has Down Syndrome' and snag some of the mystique from Obama. \n He also seeks to snag women voters and those who may want to vote for 'change' but aren't too concerned what appearance it looks like.\n \n He also shows that they party isn't sexist.\n I also doubt McCain will die in office in 4 years...but, I don't know if he can pull a 2nd term.\n \n \n Personally, I thought the republicans should have been cultivating Condoleezza Rice HARD for the past 4 years as a 'ready-made VP' choice for whom ever.\n Would have helped take the edge off of Hillary (whom I expected to run...and win) with a trump of being black as well.\n \n \n Any way, it is a radical move.\n IMO, this is one of the best elections ever.\n \n \n \n I personally would have picked Papa Smurf for my VP though.\n Age, wisdom AND a minority. emoticon_xgood",

It's the presidential slot you should be looking at...and Obama IMHO, is way inexperienced to server as president.\n\n \n It's true that Obama does not have a great deal of experience either, which was the strongest argument the McCain campaign had. Now the McCain choice for VP has undermined the Republicans' own best argument against Obama. \n \n Obama does have more experience that the current governor of Alaska. He served 8 years as a state senator, and he has been in the U.S. Senate since January, 2005. As a U.S. Senator he has dealt with foreign policy issues in his committee roles. The Governor of Alaska admitted that she has not thought much about foreign policy. Obama has also acted to choose a running mate with great experience, especially in foreign policy, to augment his own more limited experience. Biden is a terrific choice, and he is ready to step into the Presidency if it becomes necessary. \n \n This choice for a running mate seems like a stunt by McCain, an impulsive and foolish move that is being questioned by even some of his own advisors. He is like a loose cannon. This shows his poor judgment.\n \n As for the vice president not doing much, that's what the Republican Party counted on when William McKinley had a vice president named Theodore Roosevelt. Conservative Republicans at the time thought that they could bury the progressive reformer by making him the vice president, where he would not be able to do very much. They didn't count on someone assassinating McKinley. \n \n Think about those vice presidents who suddenly and unexpectedly went from not doing very much to being the President of the United States. Think about Andrew Johnson and about Theodore Roosevelt and about Harry Truman and about Lyndon Johnson and about Gerald Ford. \n \n We need someone as vice president who is ready to step into the Presidency in an instant. We need someone who has thought about foreign policy. \n \n McCain needed to choose the best qualified running mate for the job. He obviously didn't. He obviously picked her to be an ornament, a good-looking woman who would attract certain voters with certain pet issues. But this is a serious decision, not a choice to be made frivolously or to please a few voters.",

Do a search antonia, most past presidents were Governors rather than Senators because one job prepares one for running an executive office/Governments while the other is a legislative position. \n \n Which of these candidates have actually created budgets? Only Palin. Which have actually signed Bills into Law? Palin. Which has actually had to use the veto pen? Only Palin. How sad and evident it will become to all the objective voters out there when this liberal drivel starts to flow. Once again the extreme left will defeat themselves with their bitter attacks that have no basis in truth at all.\n \n What will be most enjoyable over the next 2 months is to watch the extreme liberal loony lefty's and the radical feminists who all claim to stand against bigotry and sexism (WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT FOR THEM!) will pounce on this very qualified woman who actually fulfills all of the empty promises that Obama made regarding what his administration would represent in the picture he has painted for the American people, before nominating an entrenched 35 year political insider and dinosaur like Joe Biden. \n \n Obama proved that he will tell you what you want to hear while doing the same ole, same ole SOP. While McCain has actually brought in a Washington outsider with a true record of undeniable accomplishments, which become even more impressive when her short tenure is taken into consideration. Deal with it lefty's, you're betting on a loser.\n \n \nThe other thing that comes to mind is drilling for oil. But I don't see why her being in the VPcy would be so important towards those ends. (Unless Cheney thinks he will never have to leave?)\n\n \n How about because she's the Governor of the largest energy State in the USA? And she served on the Alaska Energy Commission, And she understands the energy issues up their first hand. Nothing about the questions regarding drilling in Alaska is hypothetical or theoretical for her, but is understood in a way that none of the other candidates can appreciate, including McCain. Her knowledge is invaluable in the area of energy exploration and drilling.\n \n \nThe idea of the country being in her hands concerns me very much.

He's much older, we're in a war, we have terrorism to deal with, serious economic and international issues. It looks like very poor judgment, to me.\n\n \n So her 7 years of real time experience running 2 separate executive offices is no preparation at all for the #2 slot, while Obama's time as a community activist in a neighborhood in Chicago IS acceptable preparation for the top spot as Commander and Chief? Obama has only legislative experience with absolutely no foreign policy experience either, yet you consider him prepared for the TOP SLOT?\n \n You should be ashamed of yourself for dissing a woman with so many personal and political accomplishments under her belt at so young an age, all while raising a family of 5 children too. So once again it's the liberals who talk about womens rights and equal opportunity while its the republicans who actually deliver the goods to make it a reality.",

   "You live in your stereotypes about other people, Archangel. You seem to think that, because a woman supported Hillary Clinton, they should support any woman running for office, or that, if you dangle a woman candidate in front of their noses, they're actually shallow enough to bite the bait. Or think that they should. To wag your finger and moralize to them about that! \n\n \n That wasn't what i was saying at all antonia. Why do you lefty's always get it so wrong? Sarah Palin has 7 years running either a City or a State Government. She has written budgets, vetoed and signed bills into law, overseen the running of the States Military forces, was on the Alaska State Energy Commission, and made a difference there. She also took on powerful and established politicians in areas of corruption and beat them. She has an 80% job approval rating in a State where everyone knows everyone which means a large percentage of democrats and independents also love her.\n \n If you had an honest bone in your body, you'd openly admit that it isn't her qualifications that you don't like about her because she is more qualified than Obama, who's at the top of the democrats ticket. What you don't like about her is what she doesn't stand for. And by that I mean abortion, evolution and gay marriage.\n \n \n Earlier on, when Hillary Clinton was still running, you assailed me for supporting her \"only because\" she was a woman. Now you assail me for not supporting Sarah Palin just because she is a woman. You speak about bitterness, but it is you who sounds intensely bitter and venomous. With your obsessional tunnel vision interest in overturning Roe.\n\n \n This is a blatant and unmitigated lie antonia. I clearly said at the time that if hitlery was a worthy candidate then I would proudly support a woman, as is evidenced here by my support of Palin. My problem with Clinton was her corrupt power hungry self serving need to attain as much personal power as she could garner with no sincere concern for the American People at all. And I questioned your intelligence for being sucked into such crapola as she so easily dishes out. And I can see that you haven't learned anything since then. emoticon_xdonnoemoticon_frazzled \n \n \nGo in peace, Archangel. I have no interest in discussing any of this with you. There are plenty of Republican women and men McCain could have chosen, pro-choice or pro-life, who I could not possibly assail on the basis of competancy -- or as fully irresponsible choice -- insofar as having the entire United States of America in their hands. Along with the entire planet's interests.\n\n \n No there aren't! There aren't any at all that you wouldn't have assailed as having some perceived deficiency that didn't meet up with your radical feminist and socialist leanings. So stop lying as if you're sincerely looking for a way to get along. It just exemplifies the hypocrisy that your political party is so famous for. Palin is everything your candidate claimed to want to stand for, as in being a Political outsider rather than a Washington insider. That is exactly what Palin truly is where as Biden is a 35 year entrenched political dinosaur, and the epitome of an insider. She has been a true maverick who has even rejected Federal money for a bridge to know where. And she increased corporate taxes to the Oil Companies that allowed her to return a 1500$ rebate to the citizens of Alaska. She has actually done things that the Washington Insiders have only talked about doing, and if I know them, they read about HER actually doing these things, saw how good they turned out and decided to adopt them as their own ideas. But only Sarah Palin did them.\n \n \nIf you want to call that \"looney left\" \"radical feminism\", you must be really live in a very desperate tiny mental world. With the only perspective revealed by your post, \"radical looney right\".\n\n \n Speaking of the radical loony lefty feminists, do you know what is so wonderful about them? They are the loudest most angry women out there. But they are still a small minority. So the louder they get as election day arrives, the more they turn off the masses and insure that a conservative wins in the end.",

No, the estate of the deceased person is being transferred....and the only people taxed have so much money that they are the super-wealthy. They are multi-millionaires.\nAnd therein lies the rub.

Fifty-five percent of conservatives said yes versus only 20 percent of liberals.\n Rush Limbaugh, Ronald Reagan, Bill O'Reilly and Dick Cheney have given large sums of money to people in need, while Ted Kennedy, Nancy Pelosi, Michael Moore, and Al Gore have not.\n Those who are \"very liberal\" are 3 times more likely than conservatives to throw things when they get angry.\n The American left prides itself on being superior to conservatives: more generous, less materialistic, more tolerant, more intellectual, and more selfless. For years scholars have constructed--and the media has pushed--elaborate theories designed to demonstrate that conservatives suffer from a host of personality defects and character flaws. According to these supposedly unbiased studies, conservatives are mean-spirited, greedy, selfish malcontents with authoritarian tendencies. Far from the belief of a few cranks, prominent liberals from John Kenneth Galbraith to Hillary Clinton have succumbed to these prejudices. But what do the facts show?\n \n Peter Schweizer has dug deep--through tax documents, scholarly data, primary opinion research surveys, and private records--and has discovered that these claims are a myth.

It was federal government spending, beginning with the New Deal and culminating in World War II spending, that generated the consumption that pulled the economy out of the depression. \n \n Now, I'm no fan of pointless and excessive government spending. I do believe the federal government (note that I said federal government, not the state governments here) needs to oversee the economy as a whole and ensure that the economy continues to prosper. The Depression has taught us that we need the federal government to act as a balancer, to ensure that nothing like the Great Depression happens again. \n \n State governments are in less of a position to influence the economies of their states, though they certainly try to do so. I live in Ohio. We currently have a Democrat in the governor's office, following a Republican named Taft who was convicted of a crime, but our Democratic governor has been in office less than 2 years. The state legislature is dominated by Republicans and has been for a very long time. Our economy is doing poorly. Conservative approaches to governing by our Republican legislature and previously Republican governor have not led to prosperity here in Ohio. Why? Because the forces pulling industrial jobs out of our state are greater than the state can counter with incentives to industry. \n \n Note too that the U.S. economy is doing poorly, and we have had a Republican in the White House for the past 8 years. I know that some conservatives like to argue that Bush turned out to be not a real conservative, and on federal spending that is certainly true. The war, of course, has done terrible damage to our economy.....damage we will come to see over time as we try to pay the bills. But Bush is a Republican, and Bush is no liberal. And he has given us tax cuts, and the economy is still in the tank right now. Though in theory tax cuts should work to boost consumer spending and thus economic activity, in practice tax cuts are often not enough. They have not been enough to turn this economy around.",

   "The Constitution never called for an overreaching government, but you and your ilk apparently want this.\n\n \n One person's \"overreaching government\" is another person's appropriately acting government. \n \n Note that even the founding generation vigorously debated what role the federal government should play in the economy and how active the federal government should be. Back then, it was the Federalists, generally regarded as conservatives, who favored a powerful federal government, while the party of Jefferson favored greater state powers and less federal power. \n \n And of course Chief Justice John Marshall, whose sympathies arguably lay with the Federalists, generally interpreted the constitution as giving the federal government broad powers. We Americans today are the inheritors of those rulings and that broad constitutional interpretation. When it came to the powers of the federal government, over time the Jeffersonians lost, and though the Federalist Party died out rather quickly, their vision of a federal government with broad powers ultimately won out over time.",

   "People who have an estate of 2 million dollars or more, or 3.5 million next year, will get to leave their children plenty of inheritance even with the tax they pay. You seem to ignore the reality that these are very wealthy people who are expected to pay estate tax. The children who inherit this large an estate are not left destitute from paying tax on it. They are getting a large inheritance. And the fact that the taxation occurs upon death....so what? It doesn't matter.

No, that's no right.\n \n \nWhy not feel sorry instead for the people who are forced to spend down their entire estate on a nursing home before they can qualify for Medicaid, because our Medicare system does not cover nursing home care or home care for the elderly over time?\n\n \n Who says we have to choose?? You're conflating two separate issues here; we should fix healthcare regardless! It's not a matter of \"feeling sorry\" for people; it's simply a matter of what we're using for taxation opportunities. And the death of a loved one just isn't a good thing to use to tax people. No one is saying we shouldn't have taxes on the wealthy in general, or that we should not fix healthcare for seniors or others.\n \n \nInstead of feeling sorry for the very wealthy, who do just fine even with the current tax system, why not worry more about those who have less, and who lose everything when they go into nursing homes or elder care centers?\n\n \n ??? Why do you keep bringing up unrelated issues here? I'm certainly not against helping those who have less, and am all for that. That doesn't change the other issue we're talking about though.\n \n \nOh, and changing the tax system so that the wealthy do not have their estates taxed WOULD make them even richer, because their tax obligations would be reduced from what they currently are.\n\n \n I'm not sure how you can say keeping money one already owns makes someone richer than they already are, but whatever!",

A pro-lifer can, at the same time without contradiction, admit that abstinence is best, and also applaud the decision of individuals not to view the new human life that might ensue from not practicing abstinence as \"punishment for a mistake\" (to paraphrase one Presidential candidate) that would warrant the decision to terminate it.\n \n In other words, one can at the same time applaud this young girl's decision not to devalue human life and dignity even though she is going through one of the most inconvenient pregnancies one can imagine, while at the same time detest one Presidential candidate's vigorous desire not to prohibit doctors from withholding treatment from infants who miraculously survive an attempted abortion.",

No one is saying we shouldn't tax the wealthy in general; no one is making the case here that the wealthy shouldn't incur more taxes than others. this is about a particular tax--the fact that death is being used for taxation. You keep trying to turn this into a rich vs. poor thing in terms of taxation, and that's not what this is about at all.\n \n \n \n Wanting people who have just lost loved ones to not have to be burdened over accommodating government and policy while they're grieving isn't \"whining\". I don't think the government is going to fall apart by letting people grieve for awhile first before stepping in and saying 'give me $, or doing away with the death tax and making it up in other taxes on the wealthy. So far, your arguments on this have only consisted of the fear the wealthy won't be taxed. So if the death tax is made up for by increasing other taxes on wealthy people along the way, then there shouldn't be a problem, now should it?

   "And yet you've certainly spent time here on this.\n \n I honestly thought you would undertand the issue of sensitivity toward people when they lose loved ones, but apparently I was wrong given your last post. Someone being rich doesn't mean we should misuse the tragedy in their lives for something ulterior. Just because they are rich doesn't mean they aren't grieving. This is just common decency this about. I really do hope you will, at some point, at least be willing to recosided your approach on this.\n\n \n This again makes no sense to me. People who are grieving should not have to pay taxes? \n \n The day after my dad died, I began a fairly long and detailed process of arranging his cremation and burial, organizing his memorial service, and doing all the many practical and often costly tasks of handing his estate, from ordering death certificates to sending back the pension check he received for time after he had died to paying his last medical bills. I had to inform everyone connected with him, including all his various medical providers, that he had died. These tasks were expensive and time consuming. The fact that I was grieving did not mean I got out of paying for everything. Before I could sell his house, I had to have his will probated. There were pretty hefty lawyer's fees. Then came the process of selling the house, which required me to pay to clear the entire house of its contents and then paint and refinish the floors and make repairs prior to putting the house on the market. The house was 600 miles from where I live now, which meant that I had to spend weeks away from home taking care of all of this. Dealing with money and the various expenses that came with my dad's death were just part of a long process of closing out his life. It didn't end until I did his final tax returns this past April.\n \n To be honest, while this was a lot of work and turned out to cost thousands of dollars, the task of closing out my father's life and dealing with his estate were healing for me. I had work to do to wind things up, and doing the work and paying the bills kept me going through the grief. I ended up getting a small inheritance thanks to the money from the sale of the house. The inheritance more than offset the expenses I had to cover. I ended up thinking that my dad would have been proud of the way I took care of things; he was very organized in his life, and I was organized in his death. I got a pretty good price for the house, and I sold it quickly after it was probated. My dad would be very pleased with me about that. He is also buried in a lovely veterans' cemetary. And I led the memorial service, which was a wonderful, funny, caring tribute to my great dad. \n \n Had I been expected to pay taxes on my dad's estate, it would have been just one more set of expenses to deal with, one more check to write. It would not have made my grief worse. There really was no connection in my mind between the bills I had to pay, which were numerous, and the grief I experienced. Paying bills did not make my grief worse. And inheritance, while nice, was never something I expected. I preferred having my father alive than having his money after his death. I was glad that he spent most of his savings before he died, because he lived a long and wonderful life. And I am at a point now when I really don't need an inheritance; I earn enough money to support myself and my family. \n \n That was a long response, but your questions prompted me to think about the connection between the expense and work of closing out my father's life and my grief. And far from exacerbating my grief, paying the bills and doing the work were part of a process of healing for me, and they were helpful to me. \n \n I feel that God carried me through the whole process of my father's passing, and God was gentle with me, and people around the me were gentle with me. I am thankful for that. Paying bills, including my dad's taxes, did not make things worse. And getting an inheritance was the last thing on my mind. I really didn't care about that, nor did I care about paying taxes.",

   "Returning to the topic of the thread, Sarah Palin, I read something about her past that troubles me. When she stepped down as mayor of that little city of fewer than 9,000 people, her husband's step mother decided to campaign for the position. According to a NYTimes story, Sarah Palin refused to support her candidacy for mayor because the step mother is pro-choice. She supported a candidate who opposes abortion, the candidate who won the election. \n \n Assuming the story is true and this is really the reason why Palin refused to support her husband's step mother in the race, I find her motivations and her actions problematic. A mayor's decisions have nothing to do with the issue of abortion, as far as I can see. Mayors are not responsible for keeping abortion legal, nor are they responsible for making abortion illegal or for preventing abortions. If Sarah Palin refused to support someone for mayor because of their beliefs about abortion, how does/will she respond to the pro-choice women in her own Republican Party? Some of the most experienced and qualified leaders the party has are pro-choice women. Will she try to block them from being named to cabinent positions because they are pro-choice? There are also some pro-choice men who are important leaders. And of course, the Republicans, if they are to win the election, have to reach out to pro-choice voters, especially to pro-choice independents. \n \n For Sarah Palin to refuse to support a pro-choice candidate for mayor simply because they are pro-choice, a position unrelated to the issue of abortion, suggests a rigidity of belief that no national political leader should exhibit. A President and Vice President are leaders of all the people, not just of the people who agree with them. \n \n Sarah Palin appears, according to this story anyway, to have made beliefs about abortion a litmus test for someone being elected to any public office, even mayor of a very small city. If the story is true, then she refused to consider whether the candidate was actually best qualified to be mayor. She rejected them because their beliefs about an issue unrelated to the position did not conform to her beliefs. (This is all assuming the news story is true.

It may not even be true that the reason she refused to vote for her husband's step mother is because of her pro-choice beliefs. But if it is true, it shows a rigid unwillingness to accept people whose views differ from hers in a position that has nothing whatever to do with abortion. My view is that it doesn't matter what a mayor's position is on abortion, because the job of mayor has nothing to do with abortion, and one's views on abortion are irrelevant to the job. To refuse to vote for someone for mayor because of their position on abortion is like refusing to vote for someone for mayor because they are Catholic or because they are a conservative Christian. \n \n Voting for candidates to serve in public office is in effect hiring someone. It's hiring done by the populace. If Sarah Palin is indeed unwilling to hire someone whose views on abortion differ from hers in a position that has nothing to do with abortion, then that's a problem, I think. \n \n I would never refuse to vote for someone for mayor because of their beliefs about abortion. Abortion is only relevant if someone's views actually affect the job they are going to do. When you go to hire someone, you shouldn't make a litmus test of people's personal beliefs about issues that are irrelevant to the job. \n \n Sure, Sarah Palin has every right to refuse to vote for people who are pro-choice. But if that is in fact what she did in the case of the mayor's position, then to me it raises a red flag about what she is likely to do as Vice President of the United States. And it does raise questions about how she will work with people who disagree with her. If someone uses views on abortion as a litmus test for political offices that have nothing to do with abortion, then that's a problem for someone who is in a position to occupy the Presidency of the United States, in my view.",

   "You just prove how little you know about the responsibilities of a Mayor Op. Doesn't the Mayor of a city have the power to either influence or restrict the creation of an abortion clinic? Couldn't that mayor either support or obstruct such a clinic from being allowed in its town? Of course she/he would. That's why these political issues are important and define what politicians represent to their constituents. So don't attempt to imply that IF THIS UNPROVEN ALLEGATION ABOUT HER MOTHER IN LAW IS TRUE AT ALL, that if say's something bad about Sarah Palins character at all. It just shows she is consistent in her moral and political values.\n\n \n It is certainly not the responsibility of a mayor to prevent legal medical clinics from being created or from operating. A mayor could try to throw up legal obstacles like trying to deny building permits, but a city cannot block a permit based on the fact that the building would be used for performing legal abortions. A community cannot prevent doctors from practicing medicine simply because some of the community residents dislike the legal medical procedures the doctors perform. It should never be the role of a mayor to prevent doctors from providing legal medical services. \n \n Of course we have seen more and more states enact what are called TRAP laws to effectively regulate abortion clinics to death, with regulations that have nothing to do with abortion but which are clearly intended to make continued operation of abortion clinics not feasible. This has been a strategy of the anti-choice people given that they haven't been able to overturn Roe v. Wade to date. Last September a federal court struck down one such TRAP law. \n \n If Sarah Palin's choice to support an anti-abortion candidate for mayor rested on her belief that this mayor should block legal medical procedures from taking place in the city, then this would be MORE reason for all of us to prevent her from ever becoming Vice President. But I have seen no evidence that this was her motivation. It may be YOUR wish, Archangel, that anti-abortion mayors block clinics from providing medical services. If so, your position is extreme.",

(Note that I did not say the person's family life. I really don't care that her daughter is pregnant.) Palin's record is thin. We don't have much to go on. Her actions as mayor, the positions she took, need to be scrutinized. In my view, you don't just ignore someone's injection of abortion into a campaign where this issue had no relevance to the position involved. Not when the stakes are this high. \n \n If what you write is true about how opponents of abortion feel, then we need to think about whether we want someone as Vice President whose litmus test for someone holding public office is whether they hold an anti-abortion position. As I said earlier, the President has to be President of the whole country, not just President of the people that he or she agrees with. If Sarah Palin was unwilling to vote for someone for mayor because of their beliefs about abortion, will she refuse to accept someone as secretary of state because of their beliefs about abortion? Will she refuse to accept someone as secretary of defense because of their beliefs about abortion? Is a person's position on abortion the litmus test for every public office, in her mind? These are the kinds of questions that reporters need to put to Palin in the debates. \n \n To me, Sarah Palin refusing to vote for someone for mayor because of their pro-choice beliefs is no different from someone refusing to vote for someone for mayor because they hold anti-abortion beliefs, or because they are a conservative Christian, or because they are Catholic. Sure, people have the right to vote for whatever reasons they wish. But if they want to be President or Vice President, they need to explain how their public actions reflect their values. The question in my mind here is whether Sarah Palin is so rigid in her religious/political beliefs that this is the whole of her agenda, and she won't work with people whose beliefs differ from hers. Will she truly govern all of America, or will she insist that all of America must conform to her particular beliefs?\n \n If a Democratic vice president candidate had refused to vote for someone for mayor simply because the mayoral candidate opposed abortion, wouldn't this be questioned by the anti-abortion forces?

I have said all along \"if the story is true.\" I have never claimed and do not claim with certainty to know that the story is true. I have said, \"If the story is true.....\"\n \n The best way, I think, to find out why Sarah Palin supported the anti-abortion candidate for mayor is to ask her. Did she vote for this candidate purely or mainly because of the candidate's anti-abortion stance? Or were there other issues that drove her vote, and if so what were they? How much does or would the issue of abortion weigh in her hiring decisions and other decisions if she becomes Vice President, and will she work with government leaders who are pro-choice? Will she be open to the concerns of pro-choice Americans? To what extent would this one issue shape how she governs? These are all legitimate questions, I think, for someone who may be the next Vice President of the United States. They are only questions on one issue, of course. There are many questions on many issues that we need to ask Sarah Palin. \n \n The other voters who voted for the winning candidate for mayor are not up for becoming Vice President of the United States. Their motivations for voting are not in question, because they are not in a position to possibly become leader of the nation. There is no need to question why they voted as they did. \n \n Sure, an anti-abortion mayor has the bully pulpit, as public figures do on any issue. They may not be able to do anything directly about an issue, but they can rally the believers. But is that what we want the Vice President of the United States to see as most critical: rallying the people against abortion? Should that one issue dictate whom this person supports politically and whom she does not support? That's why we need to question her about this. If this issue dominates her agenda to the extent that she would not support in office people who are pro-choice, then we should all know that.\n \n Once again, the President and Vice President must be leaders of ALL the people, not just people who agree with them on one issue. Their personal agenda should not dictate how the country is governed. If the American people want a President who makes abortion their central issue, then the people can, of course, vote for such a person. But I don't think most Americans want that. I don't think most Americans want someone in the highest or second highest office in the land who would not hire someone just because they are pro-choice or who would not vote for someone just because they are pro-choice. I think we don't want someone in that position who uses beliefs about abortion as a litmus test.",

   "Please go back and read my previous posts in which I said \"if the story is true\" and where I said that it may not be true, or she may have had other reasons for not voting for her husband's step mother. \n \n Please read my posts more carefully. I presented that caveat several times in my posts. Also, I first read this story not in Time but in a story in the NYTimes. It isn't only Time that is presenting this. \n\n \n Yes, you did, but the impression I got is that your opinion is that she did indeed 'inject' the abortion issue which would assume that \"a couple of people told me that they thought abortion was the reason\" is enough for you to have come to a conclusion yourself. If that's not the case and you haven't made a judgment here, then ok; sorry to have assumed you did. Also, my opinion is that both the NYTimes and Time magazine are exercising irresponsible journalism to be publishing based on mostly the rumor mill. Frankly, I'm not even sure it's worth even questioning over based on he-said/she-said rumors. Perhaps if something more substantial turned out to be behind it. I mean, anyone could state such a vague opinion. There's just not enough basis here for this to even come up, really.\n \n \nMy call has been to ask Sarah Palin questions about her positions, to question her about whether she would vote only for someone who opposes abortion, and whether she would accept working in the next administration with people who are pro-choice. I am not indicting her for her vote for mayor; I am asking that reporters question her about it and raise questions with her about whether she will truly serve all the people if elected, not just those with whom she agrees on abortion or other issues.\n\n \n But why wouldn't she? And if she is asked, is it really conceivable that Palin or any other politician would respond \"no, I won't serve all the people if elected\"? NO one running for office would ever answer that question as a 'no.' But more importantly, the question arises solely on he-said/she-said rumor. I'm just not sure that should even be the foundation for any line of questioning. That's my opinion anyway.\n \n \nBtw, it was in the liberal blogosphere, on Daily Kos where I first read that Sarah Palin's daughter is pregnant. That was a rumor that turned out to be true.\n\n \n But that is a rumor that is pretty easily substantiated, and would have been rather obvious eventually, no matter what. A rumor that someone opposed someone running for office based on a certain ideological issue is something much less able to be substantiated and could simply be chalked up to opinion (or partisan rumor-mongering, for that matter). I'm not saying that's all it is or not--I'm saying that I am cautious to even assume anything here.",

This may well not be a secret; she may indeed regard this as a moral decision that she made. The important question, I think, for us as voters is what priority she gives to opposing abortion versus other issues, and to what extent she will make working with people and supporting people requisite on their opposing abortion. \n \n Ultimately, I think it's important that we learn whether we are potentially electing a rigid idealogue or someone who is more flexible and willing to work with a lot of different groups of people, whether they agree with those groups on every issue or not. Sarah Palin may turn out to be in the latter category. I think we should try to find out. \n \n I think our society holds an important place for passionate idealogues. William Lloyd Garrison, the radical abolitionist, was a tremendous force in American history, someone whom I deeply admire and will always admire. He would, I think, have been a terrible President. What some would see as Garrison being passionately committed to his cause, others would see as Garrison being rigid, uncompromising, and ideologically driven. Lincoln had a different temperament, one better suited, I think, for being President of all the people. \n \n While one may support the cause championed by the radical reformer, one has to recognize that the President of the United States presides over all the people, and his or her first priority must be to govern everyone, not ram through radical reforms. That's why I think Ralph Nader would not make a good President. I admire Ralph Nader and support much of what he stands for. I would not want him for President.",

It's a constitutionally protected right, whether folks agree with that interpretation of the constitution or not. For a President or Vice President to focus on rallying the people against abortion, or to make decisions that support limiting or undoing a woman's right to choose abortion, is a radical position to take. It is a declaration that the President or Vice President stands against a constitutionally protected right and will try to use his or her office to eliminate this constitutionally protected right.

   "You just said let's assume for the purposes of this argument that she did refuse to vote for a candidate because she was pro-choice, and then you turned around and questioned whether she in fact did that.\n\n I don't think I did that. I wrote that post with a great deal of haste, though. I've gone back to read it, and I can't see where you are getting that.\n \n \nThe other voters who voted for the winning candidate for mayor are not up for becoming Vice President of the United States. Their motivations for voting are not in question, because they are not in a position to possibly become leader of the nation. There is no need to question why they voted as they did.\n\n The point was that since the person Governor Palin voted for actually ended up winning, it is more reasonable to assume that person was qualified for the office than to assume otherwise.\n \n \nBut is that what we want the Vice President of the United States to see as most critical: rallying the people against abortion?\n\n I can't answer that. What I can say is that handling abortion is not all that a Vice President does. And the facts that are known suggest that being pro-life is not all that Governor Palin has done either.\n \n I freely admit that not very much is known about her. But I firmly believe that such little knowledge does not justify taking what little is known about her and projecting speculative conclusions from sparse facts. The narrative should be derived from the facts; the facts should not be cherry-picked to bolster a preconceived narrative.\n \n More will be known about her in due time. The media will not let us down on this. They will search every nook and cranny; they will examine every public document; the will pour through her records; they will interview all her friends and enemies. She will be in the public spotlight from now until November; she will give speeches; she will participate in a national debate. I believe we will know enough about her as this progresses to make accurate claims and reasonable judgments. Until then, I wish everyone would hold their horses. I know that is a lot to ask and should not really be expected, but I do believe it is the proper posture for reasonable people who want to judge correctly according to the truth.\n \n \nShould that one issue dictate whom this person supports politically and whom she does not support? That's why we need to question her about this. If this issue dominates her agenda to the extent that she would not support in office people who are pro-choice, then we should all know that.\n\n There is nothing to suggest that she cannot work with people who are pro-choice. If you would like an affirmative statement from her stating as much, that is obviously your prerogative. But based on the evidence we have, there simply is no reason to fear that she can't work with pro-choice individuals. Take as a case-in-point the numerous elected officials who are pro-life at all levels of government. The overwhelming number of them work fine right alongside pro-choice individuals.\n \n \nOnce again, the President and Vice President must be leaders of ALL the people, not just people who agree with them on one issue.Their personal agenda should not dictate how the country is governed. If the American people want a President who makes abortion their central issue, then the people can, of course, vote for such a person. \n\n People say this, but I have no idea what it means. What does it mean that the President is leader of \"all the people?\" In the context this phrase is usually spoken, it means that, therefore, the President cannot advance position X. I find that somewhat perplexing.\n \n Once a person gets elected, they have to make decisions. There is no circumstance where \"all the people\" are going to support any decision made by an elected official. We hold elections. The victors get to set policy according to established procedures. If a sufficient number of people disagree with the policies (that's a good deal less than all of them, of course), then they can replace them with another official.\n \n One need not support the vigorous pro-life policies that a McCain Presidency would enact. He is free to vote for another candidate. But I think it is quite perplexing to suggest that, because all of the people don't agree on how to handle abortion, government must therefore be silent on it all together. \n \n \nBut I don't think most Americans want that. I don't think most Americans want someone in the highest or second highest office in the land who would not hire someone just because they are pro-choice or who would not vote for someone just because they are pro-choice. I think we don't want someone in that position who uses beliefs about abortion as a litmus test.\n\n There's only one way to find out.",

It is at least as radical of a pro-choice view as is the Republican ticket's view is a radical pro-life view.\n \n The evidence of this, of course, is Senator Obama's decision as an Illinois legislator not to force doctors, by law, to provide basic life-saving medical treatment to those infants who survived an attempted abortion. I don't mind people using rhetoric. It's fine to call the Pro-life positions held by Senator McCain and Governor Palin \"radical.\" But let's be fair and keep everything in perspective.

When constitutional law is misguided and harmful, the president has to act in a different manner. Regardless of the fact that it was wartime with states seceding, Lincoln did in fact act contrary to constitutional law.\n \n Also, I would say that essentially, we could say that every president \"imposes\" their personal agenda on everyone else, in a sense. This is one reason new presidents don't usually keep many of the appointed leadership positions of the previous administration, but instead appoints people with similar views as they have.

You seem less interested in seeing her answer tough questions than I do, though perhaps that's not an accurate observation. Whether most people who oppose abortion work fine alongside people who are pro-choice tells us nothing about whether this is true of Sarah Palin. It's a question to be answered. \n \n As for what it means to be President of all the people, I think that being elected President does not give someone a mandate to force a particular ideology or personal agenda on the whole of the American people. When nearly 50% of the people do NOT vote for a President, or as in 2000 when a majority of the people vote for the other candidate, then the President must respond to the needs and views of those with whom he or she disagrees as well as those with whom he or she agrees. Becoming President did not give Bush as mandate to force a right-wing agenda on the whole population. We were able to resist the imposition of that agenda to some degree, but not enough, and it has had terrible consequences for the nation, I think. \n \n To come back to the subject of abortion, the people are divided on this issue. A minority of the population wants abortion made illegal, though it's a sizeable and vocal minority. For the President to make ending abortion a priority of the U.S. government would be to force on Americans an agenda that most Americans do not support. And doing that is probably not very politically smart in the long run, as the people do get to vote every 4 years. Ronald Reagan seems to have recognized this, as he expressed opposition to abortion but did almost nothing actually to try to end abortion. Politically that was smart; it was a recognition that anti-abortion politics were minority politics and the public was not going to embrace an anti-abortion agenda by the President. It was a response to where the majority opinion lay. \n \n You may point out that if the President goes too far in trying to impose a particular agenda on the people, the people will push back, and that usually does happen, whether through Congressional votes or lawsuits initiated by the people or through simple popular protest and people taking to the streets or through elections. But the President does have a great deal of power to press an agenda on the American people even with the checks and balances we have and the ability of people to dissent. \n \n We have always had battles over the agenda of the President and the degree to which it runs afoul of the will of a large segment of the population. If we go back to the transition from John Adams to Thomas Jefferson, we recall a bitterly divided era ideologically, one where Adams and the Federalists sought to preserve their agenda and their influence in government through last minute appointments and through the Supreme Court, even as they had lost power. So the fight over the party in power seeking to impose its agenda on the nation is certainly not new. \n \n My argument is that we should be careful not to choose a President or a Vice President with a radical agenda in the first place, nor should we choose a President who listens only to those who share his or her agenda. We made that mistake to some extent with Bush. The reason to ask hard questions of the candidates is so we don't make that mistake again. We need to force the President to listen to and respond to all the people and to diverse viewpoints, not just the people and views with which he or she agrees. If we are successful in electing someone we do agree with, then we need to encourage care by this President that he or she not run roughshod over the people who disagree with him or her, that he or she listen to the opposition, to the dissenting voices. These are the American people too, and just because they lost the election does not mean they will simply go away or that their view are necessarily wrong. \n \n If Barack Obama wins, it is my sincere hope that he not alienate his former opponents by dismissing their concerns or by trying to enact an agenda that is total anathema to them. When he becomes President of all the people, it will be his responsibility to listen both to those who supported him and to those who opposed him. It will especially be his responsibility to listen to those who disagree with whatever agenda he brings to the table. If Bush had listened to the dissenting voices, if Lyndon Johnson had listened to the dissenting voices, if Woodrow Wilson had listened to the dissenting voices, we would not have run into the disasters that we did under those Presidents.",

Regardless of the fact that it was wartime with states seceding, Lincoln did in fact act contrary to constitutional law.\n \n Also, I would say that essentially, we could say that every president \"imposes\" their personal agenda on everyone else, in a sense. This is one reason new presidents don't usually keep many of the appointed leadership positions of the previous administration, but instead appoints people with similar views as they have. The only way that wouldn't happen is if we had a president that didn't have any convictions and had no issues on which they considered important for leaders to hold to.\n\n \n In reference to your point about the Dred Scott decision, a sitting president has to accept the decisions of the Supreme Court. He or she doesn't have to agree with them, but he or he must accept them and enforce them. President Eisenhower did not really in his heart agree with the Brown v. Board of Education decision, which he thought was forcing change too quickly on the South, but he had no choice, ultimately, but to support the Supreme Court with federal troops when white Southerners chose to defy the Court ruling. \n \n It took two constitutional amendments, ratified at the end of the Civil War, to kill the Dred Scott ruling. \n \n As for litmus tests, the President does swear to uphold and defend the constitution, so the constitution is already a litmus test for a President. I did not make it so. \n \n I encourage finding out what the agenda of candidates is. If a candidate has a radical agenda that most Americans would not support and/or which runs afoul of the constitution as it has been interpreted, then we should know about this. I would probably not support such a candidate, but it would depend on the circumstances and the specific issues in question. \n \n Read what I just posted in my last response to Phyllis for a more extensive explanation of my position on this question. I need to get to bed now, as tomorrow is a teaching day, and my child has another school day. Good night, and be well.",

   "I think we should all remember that the choice to have an abortion is still a right of women in the United States, whatever the beliefs of a minority that that's wrong. It's a constitutionally protected right, whether folks agree with that interpretation of the constitution or not. For a President or Vice President to focus on rallying the people against abortion, or to make decisions that support limiting or undoing a woman's right to choose abortion, is a radical position to take. It is a declaration that the President or Vice President stands against a constitutionally protected right and will try to use his or her office to eliminate this constitutionally protected right.\n \n Do we want as President someone who takes this radical position? Do we want as Vice President someone who takes this radical position? How far is this person willing to go to use the power of his or her office to push radical change on the nation, by trying to restrict or eliminate the right to choose abortion? \n \n We need to know the extent to which the Republican candidates take the radical position to eliminate a constitutionally protected right. This is a different position from being opposed to abortion personally but choosing not to try to eliminate the right of choice. \n \n Some folks will argue that abortion is murder, and we need to elect a President and Vice President who make eliminating the right to choose part of their agenda. Others will disagree. But we need to know just how far the candidates are willing to go to promote this radical agenda.\n\n \n Hey Op, can you prove that it's a minority of Americans who are opposed to abortions? You say it so matter of factly, I would love to see evidence of that.\n \n And why aren't you concerned about Joe Bidens Plagiarism that so obviously disqualified him to be President?

Why isn't the democratic party or the drive by media looking at these questionable aspects that reflect on the the low character of their candidate? You know why Op?

   "So you think that Lincoln acted in acceptance of the Dred Scott descision?? And If the SCOTUS makes a bad ruling, are you saying it's your opinion the president should continue that, and support a bad descision with executive decisions?\n \n Feel free to answer this later, when you get time.\n\n \n Yes, the President is obligated to enforce with executive power the decisions of the Supreme Court. This occasionally has not occurred (go back to Andrew Jackson who simply ignored the Supreme Court, but mostly the President has done so, though sometimes reluctantly. \n \n Lincoln and his fellow Republicans hated the Dred Scott ruling. The reaction from Republicans was swift and furious. But the ruling put Republicans in a difficult position legally. To accept the decision would mean acceptance of slavery and, beyond that, acceptance of Taney's ruling that the Congress had no power to outlaw slavery anywhere. This ran entirely contrary to the the Republican platform, to what the party stood for, which was no new slave states entering the nation. But to defy openly or refuse to abide by the Supreme Court decision would mean overturning the longstanding practice of adhering to the decisions of the Supreme Court as the law of the land. \n \n One approach adopted by Republicans, a legalistic one, was to accept Taney's ruling that Dred Scott was not a citizen and thus had no standing to sue, but that everything written by Taney after that, notably his declaration that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional, was not really the law, that it was obiter dictum. This was not a wholly satisfactory approach to most Republicans, but it seemed to get them around the conundrum of either accepting the ruling entirely, which they abhorred and which went against what the party stood for, or defying the Supreme Court openly and refusing to accept any of the Supreme Court ruling as the law of the land.\n \n Lincoln himself hated the ruling, and he spoke out against it in his exchange with Stephen Douglas. (The Dred Scott ruling was also a problem for Douglas and the northern Democrats, who favored popular sovereignty on the slavery question and who saw the ruling as blocking this approach to the issue also.)\n In an address on the ruling, Lincoln made his case that the ruling was wrong, but he also rejected the claim by Douglas that Republicans were defying it. Here is an excerpt from Lincoln's address to illustrate this: \n \n http://www.teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=52\n \n \"And now as to the Dred Scott decision. That decision declares two propositions-first, that a Negro cannot sue in the U.S. Courts; and secondly, that Congress cannot prohibit slavery in the Territories. It was made by a divided court-dividing differently on the different points. Judge Douglas does not discuss the merits of the decision; and, in that respect, I shall follow his example, believing I could no more improve on McLean and Curtis, than he could on Taney. \n \n \"He denounces all who question the correctness of that decision, as offering violent resistance to it. But who resists it? Who has, in spite of the decision, declared Dred Scott free, and resisted the authority of his master over him?\n \n \"Judicial decisions have two uses-first, to absolutely determine the case decided, and secondly, to indicate to the public how other similar cases will be decided when they arise. For the latter use, they are called \"precedents\" and \"authorities.\"\n \n \"We believe, as much as Judge Douglas, (perhaps more) in obedience to, and respect for the judicial department of government. We think its decisions on Constitutional questions, when fully settled, should control, not only the particular cases decided, but the general policy of the country, subject to be disturbed only by amendments of the Constitution as provided in that instrument itself. More than this would be revolution. But we think the Dred Scott decision is erroneous. We know the court that made it, has often over-ruled its own decisions, and we shall do what we can to have it to over-rule this. We offer no resistance to it.\"\n \n As for Lincoln's actions once he took office, he was in the position of entering the Presidency with the South in rebellion and war having erupted. Lincoln has been accused by critics of undermining the constitution in various ways during the Civil War in order to win it. The Emancipation Proclamation was itself a complicated step, given that it declared that slaves in the states in rebellion were free but did not free slaves in the states that remained in the Union. In effect, Lincoln didn't actually free slaves with his Proclamation, as he had no military control over the states in rebellion at that point. The Proclamation was a statement of purpose more than anything; it changed the purpose of the Union side in the war and made it a war over freedom versus slavery. It was a brilliant strategy, but in the immediate sense, it did not bring freedom. The war itself, and the disruption of the southern economy, were bringing an end to slavery, as the slaves ran away to the Union lines and were declared \"contraband of war\" by the U.S. government. \n \n The war upended the normal course of governing and threw legal and constitutional questions up in the air. It was only at the end of the war, with the ratification of Amendments 13 and 14, that the Dred Scott ruling was finally killed.",

Undoubtedly all true stories.\n \n I wonder were and how the latest news will be published. \"Democrats publish Palin's SS number\" Care to comment?\n \n BTW, are you on George Soros' pay roll.\n\n \n Banning or removing ANY books from a public library is disturbing. It doesn't matter what the books were. \n \n Newspapers should raise questions about, and doubts about, candidates for such a high public office. That's what we have newspapers for. With Joe Biden, we have a long record to examine. With Sarah Palin, who is largely unknown nationally, we have to ask questions about the record she has.",

Wade decision. That's more pro-choice sentiment than I expected to see. The support for the right to choose is actually greater than I was aware of. I never said that the support for choice is \"overwhelming,\" but according to the poll data, the support for choice is still high, despite the long and persistent efforts of anti-abortion activists to sway public opinion. \n \n Whether people favor imposing some restrictions on abortion is a different question from whether they oppose the right to choose. Even the Supreme Court in the Roe v. Wade decision laid out restrictions about when a woman can choose an abortion. Favoring restrictions on abortion, such as waiting periods and parental notification, is not the same as opposing the right to choose.",

If John McCain gets elected, I am going to join the secret service and personally make sure he does not die during his presidency.\n \n So, why do I think Palin is an idiot? Well, for starters:\n \n 1) She is a creationist that wants creationism to be taught in school. As if being a creationist wasn't indication enough, she wants to teach that to our children. It is your right to believe in whatever you want. Lets say you believe in the tooth fairy. Cool, that's great. Just don't teach in our schools that the tooth fairy exists.\n \n 2) She's against sex ed and adolescent access to contraceptive. All I can say is wow, this sure worked well with your daughter, didn't it Palin?\n \n Is she trying to get teens to catch stds and get pregnant? She claims that talking to kids about sex will make them want to have sex. 1) no it won't. I took a sex ed class, and especially after learning about the wonders of syphilis and ghonorrea, I am definitely going to use protection. She's obviously never been in a sex ed class before. 2) If you talk to kids about sex, they're going to want to have sex. If you talk to kids about allen wrenches, they're going to want to have sex.\n \n Denying adolescents access to contraceptives will only mean they will have unprotected sex, which will cause many of them to get pregnant, catch stds, and ruin their lives. Anyone who advocates this is an idiot. In case you haven't learned by now, teens will haves sex no matter what you tell them. It is what they were designed to do, and it is what nature told them to do. They were having sex at this age centuries ago, however now everyone is pushing marriage and sex to later ages. Teens do not have the sheer willpower to go against something their bodies are urging them to do, just like teens do not have the willpower to stop eating.\n \n \n \n \n 3) Shes anti-choice. Don't have the time to explain the importance of the fundamental right to ones own body. I'll do that later.\n \n For these reasons, I am deeply disappointed in John McCain.

   "My favorite Sarah Palin story from yesterday is not really about her at all. It's about Republican commentators not being careful to make sure the microphones are turned off.

Watch the clip HERE.\n \n Noonan, a former speechwriter to Ronald Reagan and a Wall Street Journal columnist, and Murphy, a longtime GOP campaign strategist, were guests on MSNBC when host Chuck Todd breaks for a commercial. The camera cuts to a wideshot, but the audio continues for another couple of minutes, as the GOPers debate the selection of Sarah Palin as John McCain's running mate, including:\n \n Murphy: It's not going to work.\n \n Noonan: It's over.\n \n Murphy: But still, McCain can give a version of the Lieberman speech to do himself some good.\n \n Todd: I think this was insulting to Kay Bailey Hutchinson ... She's never looked comfortable with this.\n \n Murphy: they're all bummed out.\n \n Todd: I mean, is she really the most qualified woman they could have turned to?\n \n Noonan: The most qualified?

The only reason I can think of for the smear campaign that went on over the last few days against Sarah Palin was that people on the left feel particularly irrationally threatened over her, more so that McCain! We don't talk about politics much at church, but last night a friend of mine and I did talk about it briefly, and he pointed out how the same sort of thing was done to Clarence Thomas years ago now when he was being appointed to the Supreme Court. A lot of tacky, trashy reporting went on over that as well. I think the liberal base and to some extent liberal media don't much like it when conservatives blow out of the water the ways liberals like to portray conservatives. It's like they really don't want conservatives to be the ones to put a woman in office. They simply don't really want a black man or woman to be successful in the Republican party or in the nation at all if they are conservative. I think this is also why Condeleeza Rice has had to deal with such mean-spirited attacks as being called \"uncle Tom\" and so forth. And what was one of the things harped on against Clarence Thomas (other than the nasty smear campaign)? Why, that he was too in-experienced! Sound familiar? And, I won't even go into some of the nasty things I've heard from the left about the Log Cabin Republicans, but suffice it to say it's worse than anything the Republicans themselves have said about them!\n \n The irony though, is that it has brought out a degree sexism among the left, and that's another reason so many of them hate her, I think--it exposes something in them that they like to accuse others of. Giuliani said it best last night when he asked rhetorically about people questioning her having a family of several children and leading, saying they never ask that sort of question about a MAN running for office. :) And of course the issue of whether or not she is qualified is a non-starter--Obama is unqualified if that's the sort of standard we are going to hold Palin to. The same goes for the 'extremist' smear--if she's an extremist, then we have to be consistent and note that Obama is an extremist to the left.",

Sarah Palin needs to be questioned about her background, her views, her previous policy decisions, and her ideas about what she would do now. \n \n I am a woman, and I don't think the media or Democrats have been \"sexist\" toward Sarah Palin.

This is the moment right after her speech, and she pumped up Republicans effectively, which she needed to do. The glow, however, will wear off, just as it wore off after the speeches of Democrats in their convention. \n \n Sarah Palin gave a good speech. Not all of it was accurate, of course.

And I have already decided to support Obama/Biden, because I agree with them for the most part on what they want to do, where they want to take our nation.\n\n \n That you wont vote for them is ok and expected Op.

The McCain campaign announced the pregnancy of Palin's daughter in a press release. Do you expect the media not to report it? The mainstream media, meaning the NYTimes, Washington Post, MSNBC, CNN, and others have not made a big deal out of Palin's daughter's pregnancy. They simply reported it. I have not seen the mainstream media attacking Palin over this. The tabloid press is something else, but their business is seeking out scandals. The blogosphere is also something else, and there have been rumors circulating on the blogosphere, such as a rumor that Palin's youngest son is actually the son of her daughter and is Palin's grandson. But anyone can post a blog, and you cannot blame the mainstream media for rumors that appear on blogs. I have nowhere see the mainstream media acting like the tabloid press. Can you present some examples of this? Perhaps I missed something in my reading of newspapers. \n \n As for questions about Palin's ability to serve as VP and raise 5 children, I heard a Republican delegate asking that question. Sure, it's a question that should be asked of Democratic candidates as well. But who has been raising this question? People writing opinion pieces? I have seen no news stories with this question. There is a difference between an editorial or an op ed piece, which is simply someone's opinion, and a news story. \n \n The mainstream media have investigated Palin on issues that matter. They have been questioning her record and her policy views. I reject the claim that they have been unfair to her. That's just Republican spin.",

Provide the evidence for us.\n \n As for Reid's use of the term \"shrill,\" yes, that is a term that is probably used more often to characterize women than men, although some commentators did describe Mitt Romney as \"shrill\" right before Super Tuesday. And there were all those blogs attacking Hillary Clinton that referred to her as \"Shrillary.\" It probably is a sexist term. But Reid, for all his failure to recognize how his terminology sounded, did not dismiss Sarah Palin because she is a woman. The issue for all the Democrats I have heard is not Sarah Palin's gender; it's her lack of experience and her positions on the issues that are the problems. \n \n Btw, I think that the Republican leaders are loving the chance to portray Sarah Palin as a victim of the media and of the \"left.\" They love being able to say, \"How awful the media have been, how unfair!\" It works with the religious right base of the party, which likes to think of itself as persecuted by elites, even though in this context, running against the \"Washington elite\" really makes no sense. The elites in charge of Washington have been Republicans, with George W. Bush the most notable of the Washington elites. John McCain is hardly less elite. But playing to the right-wing base of the party by claiming victim status for Sarah Palin works to get the base riled up and energized, even if it's based on conjuring up phony villains and phony \"elites.\" \n \n What the Republican leaders fear, I think, and what they really don't want, are the media investigations into Sarah Palin's actual experience and actual record. Because her experience is minimal, and her record is thin.\n \n As for your characterizations of me, you really should not heap labels on me given that you don't know me. I am the one who gets to tell you who I am. \n \n As for me being a \"one issue voter,\" what issue do you imagine this is? The war? The environment? The economy? Energy policy? I don't know what you think is my \"one issue\" on which I supposedly will vote. (Scratching head.) Also, what is my \"complete community?\" The community of adoptive parents?

   "You clearly DID attempt to smear me by labeling me as on the left, because you then went on to attack the left, whoever that is. I do not self-identify that way, and it's unfair for you to affix a label to me like that. Let me tell you who I am and how I identify. You can do the same for yourself. \n\n \n When someone says someone is on the left or right, I think it's reasonable that they mean they fall that way on the issues.

As quickly as you shot back, I wonder if you read the piece that I linked to before responding. \n \n Part of the problem has been reported news, on television.

But that's in another thread. \n \n Sarah Palin does not have me \"rattled.\" The nasty spin of the Republican leadership has me angry. They are attacking the media and painting Sarah Palin as a victim purely as a political tactic. Meanwhile, Sarah Palin lights into Barack Obama and tells a lie about his campaign right from the start. \n \n The Republican strategists are smart. I give them credit for that. They know how to spin a story, how to turn reality on its head by making up nonsense about the Republicans taking on the \"Washington elites.\" They know how to appeal to their base. Whether they will appeal with these tactics to independent voters is yet to be seen. I think they won't win over many. \n \n A news story just appeared that since Sarah Palin's speech last night, Barack Obama has had a surge of campaign donations. A lot of people don't like what the Republican Party stands for or what they are doing. We'll see if this approach backfires over time.\n \n Oh, and wasn't it you who said earlier, \"Maybe these are op ed pieces.\" \n \n You see, if you are going to attack the media for being unfair to Sarah Palin, you have to be clear about whom you are criticizing. Is it the news reporting that is unfair, or the op ed pieces? Because opinion pieces are just that. If you don't like the opinions that someone is expressing, write a contrary opinion. I have seen plenty of op ed pieces that are very flattering to Sarah Palin. So how are the op ed pieces \"unfair?\" Where is your whining coming from?",

The story about Biden even calls him a \"windbag,\" which is probably a fair characterization of him. He is a windbag. The story says that he sometimes says things to embarass himself. \n \n Your pointing to what you call a \"slight bias,\" which I don't see in these stories, is a far cry from substantiating claims that the media have treated Palin unfairly. I see nothing unfair in either of these stories. \n \n The outcry from Republicans over how the media have allegedly been mean and sexist to Sarah Palin has been deafening. And when called to present evidence of this here, you offer what you call a \"slight bias\" that you see in comparing two news stories. I see more critical reporting of Biden in the story about him, frankly. But we know more about Biden, because he has a longer record to examine. \n \n Folks who complain about the media also point to a few examples of commentaries that have been critical of Sarah Palin. So? There have been plenty of commentaries that are critical of Biden and Obama and McCain. Do they expect commentators to be silent about Palin for some reason? \n \n I was a Hillary Clinton supporter during the primary season. I don't think it's accurate to say that \"Hillary got railroaded by the media.\" That's just hyperbole on your part, an overstatement and an overgeneralization. Some commentators, notably Chris Matthews, said sexist things about Hillary, just as some commentators have said sexist things about Palin. But it was also in the media that the objections to these sexist statements were reported. And the news reporting about the campaign was generally fair and accurate. \n \n I think it's important to note the differences between news reporting and commentary and blogs. They are three entirely different entities. We also have to distinguish between the tabloid press, whose business is to sensationalize, and the mainstream media. The distinction between news reporting and commentary sometimes gets blurred, especially on television where we see more and more commentary, more and more people expressing opinions rather than reporting the news. Newspapers still distinguish pretty clearly between news pieces and opinion pieces.\n \n The important thing about commentary, as opposed to news reporting, is that it's people's opinions. Most mainstream news outlets offer up a range of opinions reflecting different viewpoints. On MSNBC, for example, Chris Matthews and especially Keith Olbermann express views that are usually to the left. Joe Scarborough and Pat Buchanan express views that are usually to the right. Of course we are going to hear commentary that is critical of a candidate. We are also going to hear commentary that is flattering to the candidate. Republicans cannot expect there to be no criticism of Sarah Palin from commentators. But commentators are not the news reporters. They are simply expressing their opinions. And the balance comes in the range of opinions that are expressed, and there has been a wide range. Have a few commentators said sexist things? Yes. Have most commentators said sexist things? No. Do the opinions of a few commentators represent \"the media?\" No. They are the opinions of those particular commentators. When Sally Quinn writes an opinion piece, that's her opinion, not the opinion of the whole media. \n \n I do not see in the news stories any unfair treatment of Sarah Palin. The news reporters have investigated, and they continue to investigate, Sarah Palin's record and her background. They have not focused especially on her family life. They have reported the stories about her family life, and those were put out in a McCain campaign press release. \n \n Blogs are entirely different again, because they can be written by anybody. Blogs are filled with rumors and blatant insults and untruths as well as truthful and valuable information. Blogs are under no one's control, and they are entirely different from the mainstream media.",

   "I read over the stories you linked several times, and if anything, the reporting is more critical of Biden than of Palin. The story about Biden even calls him a \"windbag,\" which is probably a fair characterization of him. He is a windbag. The story says that he sometimes says things to embarass himself. \nThen there is no hope for talking with you. For one, \"windbag\" doesn't appear once in the article. They say he is long-winded but who cares. The Palin story immediately talks about a scandal of which they never provide the full story on.\n \n \nYour pointing to what you call a \"slight bias,\" which I don't see in these stories, is a far cry from substantiating claims that the media have treated Palin unfairly. I see nothing unfair in either of these stories. \nOf course you wouldn't because \"fair\" to you seems to be to slam the ones you don't like and provide softballs for the ones you do like. \n \n I see you fail to even take into account the US Weekly magazine. \n \n \n \nI think it's important to note the differences between news reporting and commentary and blogs.\nAnd I think it is important to note the difference in reporting and power of suggestion. The news media is not going to say \"we love Obama and hate McCain\" or something but do it in the style of reporting. For example if you report on what the blogs are saying such as \"one blog says baby Palin is really the daughters and not the mothers\" and yet when it comes time for a rumor on the other side you hear nothing. You can even do it by asking tough questions to one side which are fair but then asking softballs to the other side which is still fair but certainly not equal to the other candidate. The point of the MSNBC stories is to show the tilt of the story is negative for one while positive for the other even if both are factually accurate and presenting a true picture. I am of the opinion that anyone who can't see this is just happy with how the reporting goes. \n \n And yes, they did railroad Hillary...in fact there are groups formed about it. \n \n \nOn MSNBC, for example, Chris Matthews and especially Keith Olbermann express views that are usually to the left.\nAnd you don't think this comes out when doing normal news reporting? You have to be foolish.\n \n \nI do not see in the news stories any unfair treatment of Sarah Palin. The news reporters have investigated, and they continue to investigate, Sarah Palin's record and her background. They have not focused especially on her family life. They have reported the stories about her family life, and those were put out in a McCain campaign press release. \nReally? The lead story on MSNBC.com for 2 days was about the daughters baby. The other stories were about a \"scandal\", how she really did support the bridge, and how she has no experience. Then you look at Biden who had stories about his wife and kid who died followed by his great experience in foreign policy. All of this is true but Biden has negatives and Palin has positives but those stories are never covered or are buried. \n \n Blinded by the fact that you are in favor of the result.",

This method of funding these programs is unlikely at best. Even if it is possible to fund things by raising CEO taxes, who will end up paying for this in the end? The answer is us; the middle class; those who Obama thinks he is helping, but is actually hurting.\n \n Covering the idiocy of these policies, you must regard minimum wage increases. They result in very large inflation, becuase CEOs just have to have that money. If you take it away, they'll raise prices, and in my mind that is justifiable. \n \n They are the ones who are investing money in our economy. They work twelve, sixteen, sometimes twenty hour shifts. If you worked sixteen hour shifts, wouldn't you want a little extra in your paycheck? They manage their business daily, they go through all that headache and paperwork, but their paycheck is a good incentive for all that hassle. If you take their incentive away, then there are only two outcomes. They see no point in getting less money despite the headache they go through and just give up, or as I stated above, they raise prices, and both of them will bring economic doom. Simple as that.\n \n And finally, I'll cover this greedy spirit. We're like kids making wish lists to Santa Claus. We say Dear Santa, I've been a good boy/girl. Now I want this!! I want that!!! Gimme this!!! Gimme that!! Gimme gimme GIMME GIMME GIMME!!!!!\", and frankly, the rest of the year, Santa and being good can go to hell.

And this is a 2000 mile race through the wilds of an Alaska winter. One story another racer she interviewed told was how, I think 2 years ago Todd would have won again, but 400 miles away from the finish line he broke his arm and that slowed him down getting home. \n \n One couldn't help but be in awe of a guy who was in below zero weather, in the wilds of a barren wasteland with a broken arm, and he still rode his machine home and finished the race. They showed film of Sarah out there with him at the finish line when he won 25,000.00 and when asked what she was going to do with the winnings, she happily said we'll pay off the expenses for last years race. The interviewer then said, what place did he come in? She said he didn't, his machine broke down, but this makes up for it. She was then asked if she'll let him race again next year? She said, he loves it, so I'll support him through it. You couldn't help but love her and respect the loving relationship they have together. Watch Greta on FOX tonight for the rest of it, you'll be impressed.",

The tendency is to latch onto the smallest bit of information, blow it up into some sort of controversy, and then sit by while talking heads of either side try to spin it in their favor. All of this is done in the name of \"fairness\" or \"equal time\". It promotes the idea that there are, without exception, two (or more) equally truthful sides to every story, when quite often there are not. There is no requirement that the press be \"fair,\" their obligation is to the truth.

   "I learned about the Bush Doctrine in a freshman level government course in college. \n\n \n Which one did you learn about fish? Or did you learn about all 4 of them, and if so, why didn't you realize that Gibson asked her a trick question by asking the question in the singular tense?\n Defining the Bush Doctrine: Not as Simple as it Sounds\n Easha Anand reports on the presidential race.\n \n Gov. Sarah Palin's response to Charlie Gibson's question last week about what she thought of the Bush Doctrine-\"In what respect, Charlie?\"-prompted an initial collective eye roll, but the exchange and Gibson's assertion that the doctrine allows for \"anticipatory self-defense\" has prompted a fight of its own on Wikipedia of just what, exactly, the Bush Doctrine means.\n \n In September 2007, the Wikipedia entry on the Bush Doctrine was edited 13 times. In August 2008, there was only one edit made.\n \n This month? The entry was edited 365 times, with most changes offered after the September 8 ABC interview with Palin.\n \n The pre-Sept. 8 version contains four definitions of the Bush Doctrine. Since then, hundreds of users have argued for and against asserting the phrase's ambiguous use in the media and for and against what one user calls \"the absurdity of 'several doctrines' theory.\" In a meta-twist, whether or not to include Palin's interview itself has also been the subject of debate.\n \n In the aftermath of Palin's perceived gaffe, Wikipedia users sandwiched a meaty \"Development\" section in between the introduction and an overview.\n \n The section credited conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer with coining the phrase. Krauthammer in turn used Wikipedia to bolster his authority in a recent column defending Palin. Lambasting Gibson, Krauthammer argued that there are four definitions of the Bush Doctrine, which evolved over the course of President Bush's time in office.\n \n Actually, there are currently at least six elements of the Bush Doctrine listed on Wikipedia, which includes: \"initially described the policy that the United States had the right to treat countries that harbor or give aid to terrorist groups as terrorists themselves\" and a \"controversial policy of preventive war, which held that the United States should depose foreign regimes that represented a threat to the security of the United States, even if that threat was not immediate\" and \"a policy of supporting democracy around the world, especially in the Middle East\" and \"a willingness to pursue U.S. military interests in a unilateral way\" and \"the United States had the right to treat countries that harbor terrorist groups as terrorist states themselves\" and \"the export version of compassionate conservatism.\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/09/15/defining-the-bush-doctrine-not-as-simple-as-it-sounds/?mod=googlenews_wsj\n \n And here's another link explaining it for good measure.\n 4 Bush Doctrines\n \n And here's the interview: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubsUQKd9c7c",

What makes them \"media controllers\"?\nI was not grouping them. I listed them. In different ways, they are biased against Sarah Palin and the McCain/Palin ticket. While it is true that Leno tells jokes in his monologue about both sides, he's leaning toward ridicule of Palin rather than Obama/Biden...and his off-the-cuff jokes have been directed more at Palin, as have been some of those of his recent guests. He's a biased entertainer. While it is also true that Leno has guests from both sides, it appears to me that liberals get the softball treatment and conservatives get darted. Comedians and reporters are not held to the same standard at all. An expression of bias by any entertainer (be it a news host, a comedian or a famous actor/actress) is not worthy of broadcast.

   "The Categorical Lies of Sarah Palin, Categorically Arranged\n \n Retracing the story of Sarah Palin's career is like traveling through a carnival funhouse of smoke and mirrors. No sooner do you think you've finally rounded the corner on Palin's gallery of clever distortions, dirty tricks and lies, than you're confronted with another, then another and another, until you realize you've traveled an entire catacomb of lies, smoke and mirrors. \n \n Here, we are working to assemble the entire funhouse of lies - a motley mix, ranging from little white lies, to boldface whoppers, to the more subtle forms of needle-nosed lies that are currently being molded by team McCain into a propaganda campaign that, so far, shows promise of duping American voters into believing that the McCain-Palin ticket has something to offer besides an empty platform and a plateful of lies.\n \n Because Palin's lies permeate nearly everything she says and does - and also tend to reflect back and forth through her history - it was tricky to categorize them. (How to organize such a diversity of lies? By topic? By their size? By type? By era?) We finally settled on 3 categories: Sarah's lies as mayor, governor and vice-presidential candidate. You'll still find much overlap, with lies about Palin's gubenatorial record being floated through her VP candidacy, and with team McCain's lies being puppeted by Palin, and so on. Our facts were drawn from myriad credible sources, all of which are yours for the plucking at the bottom of this post. The quotes are courtesy of Pinocchio, unless otherwise noted.\n \n canarypapers.wordpress.com/2008/09/12/the-categorical-lies-of-sarah-palin-categorically-arranged/",

That is REAL JUST US! \n People screw up and take loans they can't afford \n and people like ME have to pay for it!\n When my business had a financial hick up no one was around to help me out - I had 2 choice 1) Make It or 2) Break It.\n Look at WHERE the address to the physical part of those real estate loans malfunctioned.\n In the bowels of Democratic inequity - where people were foolish enough to think their home (like their politics) is worth more than it was!\n \n It's the fault of the Democrat States with over inflated outlook at SELF WORTH that caused this problem.\n \n Let's get real here ... \n \n WHO wanted to buy $150,000.00 homes for $400,000.00? ...NOT ME!\n WHO wanted to use A.R.M. to fund these over priced homes? ...NOT ME!\n \n ... and here we sit with the socialist left reveling in the added grasp around the throat of the world economy \n to protect the fools who just like some Thanksgiving Turkey stretched their neck out on the chopping block \n just to hope for a Presidential pardon \n \n ......... and ONCE AGAIN \"JUST US\" prevails \n \n and this liberal \"BUSH\" government blames Wall Street just like the SOCIALISTS they are! :xbanghead",
