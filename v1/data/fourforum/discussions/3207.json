   "I have some fun with this one from time to time, with my wife. One night my wife and I were discussing such things as heritage and family trees , and she blurted out that SHE was my family. I calmly corrected her, saying , \" NO dear, if you are my family, that would mean we would be living in a incestous relationship\". I told her MY family would be my parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, etc, and that she was my WIFE , not my family, and after all , we were strangers when we met, not kin. Finally , after much discussion and air sketching, she gave up . :) \n She did get the last word in tho, by telling me this. \"If you ever get in a car wreck and have to be transported to the ER, and the hospital staff asked you how to notify YOUR family, you are NOT to give them my name !! :) :)",
