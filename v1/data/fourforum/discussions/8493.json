   "This week Polish Economy Minister Piotr Wozniak said in an interview to BBC morning show that the <European Union's approach towards Russian gas supplies is a threat to European energy security<. \n \n I have to say that personally I differ from Wozniak. I live in Europe and I think that it is Poland in particular and its minor partner Ukraine that do threaten European energy sec. I will recall that it was only owing to unauthorized extraction of Russian gas (which was meant for EU) at Ukrainian gas-transfer station that Europe had to freeze over a few days early this year. \n \n And still, the latest developments in Ukraine make me feel more optimistic - I heard that Ukraine's <gas princess< Yulia Timoshenko failed to become prime-minister of Ukraine. Actually, she was the one who tried hard to enter an office of PM and after that reconsider gas agreement with Russia which correspondingly makes EU face one more energy supply crisis this winter.\n \n Now it is Poland that tries to put in fear European politicians. Where is the good of it? Please, stop trying to prejudice Europe against Russia. I think that president Putin has shown himself to good advantage and proved to be open to dialogue and cooperation with EU. As for Poland and Ukraine, I think that Europe must let them know that we ain't going let pro-American scallywags push ourselves around!",
