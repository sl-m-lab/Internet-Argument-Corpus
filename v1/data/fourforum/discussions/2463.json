On deconstructionalism, there are problems. Deconstructionalists themselves admit the problem (most anyway). It is thus: Decon- seeks to do away with all assumptions by deconstructing concepts from their cultural constructs. However, assumptions about all concepts MUST be made otherwise nothing is relevant. There must be assumptions made IN ORDER TO deconstrcut something. The essential thing that happens is you trade one set of constructs for another. \n \n The view that modernity forces order into chaos is a begged question. It assumes the essential nature of all things is chaotic. This is simply not true. Physicists would argue heavily with such a concept. If chaos were the essential nature of the universe then physical laws would have no meaning, there would be no constants (plank's, gravitational, ideal gas etc.) If indeed however there is actually order in the universe then the issue is not that society attempts to force order but actually uncover it.\n \n I will do more PO-mo- research and post again later. Excellent topic DSA. I look forward to further debate. I do hope you intend to post your opinions here.",

So it is perfectly fine with having exceptions to its own rules.\n \n Also, even if a pure deconstructionalist examination of an entity is impossible (b/c of the need for relevancy and assumptions as you say), that doesn't mean it isn't worth trying. We can't achieve pure justice, but we work to try and get as close as possible. Similarily, by trying to strip away as many false constructs as possible, we can achieve a greater degree of liberation than we would if we didn't try at all.\n \n Finally, post-modernism allows for order in principle, it just says we have no way of finding it. Theoretically, there might be a static, fixed definition of justice, but since it is impossible to bring it into the world without it being tainted by cultural constructs, we can't simply assert static identities or ideologies. However, even physical laws have their problems, specifically and especially around Black Holes (Stephen Hawking's superb \"A Brief History of Time\" explains this wonderfully). So even the laws themselves break down in certain \"chaotic\" situations, which of course calls into question their whole status as \"laws.\"",
