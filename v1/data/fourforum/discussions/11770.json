And what's the more compassionate position to take on it is a matter of opinion.\n \n \n \nWhile I may not agree with the use of the word \"independent\", I would agree with anybody who recognizes that it is clearly not the latter...\n Perhaps that's more you than I thought?\n\n \n I don't understand what you mean here.\n \n \nNo. Jesus's words which I was ACTUALLY talking about were the ones which talked about removing the beam from your own eye before you fixate on the mote in your neighbor's eye.\n\n \n Well I find it odd that you didn't quote that or specify it, until just now.\n \n \nThe Christians are taking it upon themselves to force their morality on gays, on an issue (gay equality) that doesn't harm anybody...\n\n \n No they aren't. No one's saying you have to take on the morality of Christians. \n \n \nJesus TOLD them to help the poor and feed the hungry. Jesus TOLD them to worry about their own sins. Judge not lest ye be judged. No desert until you eat your brussel sprouts.\n THOSE are the words he said that they are ignoring...\n\n \n Then start a thread about that in the religion forum. Whether Christians are feeding the hungry is a SEPARATE issue from their stance on gay rights. \n \n Look, people are multi-faceted in their views. You just want gay rights to be done only the way YOU want, and if it's not, you equate that with the likes of not feeding children. Sorry, but you don't get to define what constitutes COMPASSIONATE here. \n \n \nMaybe you should take these thoughts, turn around, and apply your own words TO YOURSELF ....[Foundit's voice trails off ....]\n\n \n Foundit, there's not a THING you've said here that you shouldn't also say to yourself. Since you're on the hypocrisy crusade; get you OWN mirror.\n \n \nAnd WOW whatta read.\n Genocide, slavery, misogyny, incest, ...\n The book's a raging soap opera!\n In addition to showing me that I was right in thinking it a book of over-publicized, self-justifying, fear-mongering fantasy, I recognized that the people who were using the bible as a reason to rail against me were typically ignoring its own words themselves.\n\n \n This is an ENORMOUS over-simplification on your part, and to pretend there aren't valid arguments about why these things exist in the Bible that are apologetic for Christianity is downright dishonest. It's beyond the topic of this thread, but it's not so simple as you portray it here.\n \n More importantly, it's beside the point in terms of whether or not Christians feed starving children. Many of them DO. \n \n \nSo what you find \"funny\" is actually a reaction (not an initial action, but a reaction) to the aggressive anti-gay Christian machinery.\n And the point is NOT to \"make sure Christ's words are kept\", but rather to send the anti-gay Christians a clear message...\n There is no way in hades I will show interest in keeping \"Christ's words\" when the anti-gay Christians obviously don't show any real interest in doing so either...\n\n \n Foundit, you may be offended by this, but I really don't care what you think of Christians nor do I particularly think that should be some priority of mine. That's your problem. Neither I nor any most other Christians owes you anything on that--if people have wronged you then you need to take it up with them on a personal basis. It's going to wound no one for you to say what you've said here. And frankly, whether or not you want to follow the words of Christ is between you and Christ. If you are of the mindset that you would decide the validity of the Bible based on other people rather than the words themselves, I think you've missed the boat. It's really not my problem (or ANYone's problem other that yours) if you've been wronged by some people that were Christian.\n \n \"Anti-gay Christians\" (whatever that means) aren't some unified body. In most cases they just happen to be Christians who's religion is that gay relations = wrong and they don't believe such relations should be validated in law by giving them rights. They may be wrong constitutionally on that, but the point is, that's really all they have in common. They aren't some card-carrying membership, and I get the impression you think they are some monolithic body or something. Whatever specific Christians that wronged you are the only ones that wronged you. And they are the ones you need to take it up with.\n \n People get on these hypocrisy crusades (sometimes even illegitimate, as in this case) and it's silly, really. Just debate the issues rather than just trying to be he hypocrisy police.",

   "Foundit, if you haven't learned by now that most of these Christians don't oppose gay rights because they hate gays, you're probably never going to really understand the situation adequately.

The motivation is indeed important, and considering how much time YOU spend castigating these \"anti-gay Christians\" for their supposed 'hate', it seems you need to be taking your own advice. \n \n Re. the \"harm\" thing, any moral stance--including ones you have, could be claimed as a precipitant of 'HARM' if the people experiencing it are restricted by it in some way and are so inclined to claim they are being harmed.\n \n - It harms married people because they don't have a free enough culture to feel they can engage in adultery all they want due to the morality of others in the culture.\n \n - It harms Christians to not be able to take a political stand from the pulpit.\n \n - It harms would-be drug users because they are restricted from using drugs.\n \n In cases where gays are actually physically and quantifiably harmed, then you've got a point. But lack of marriage isn't HARM, any more than would-be polygamists are HARMED by not being able to get married. Or pedophiles are HARMED by not being able to marry the way they want. \"HARM\" is a concept that needs to be quantifiable for it really mean anything. Otherwise it's just a rhetorical statement of subjectivity.\n \n \n1) Just cause something has a religious basis doesn't mean it isn't also an issue of prejudice.\n Being Jewish or Muslim is against the first commandment.\n Does that mean that desires to discriminate against other religions means it's not \"prejudice\"? \n\n \n Did I say it can't be both? No, I didn't. But you're taking a guilty-till-proven-innocent approach; if you have proof that prejudice is what's behind it instead of religious belief, by all means, prove it right here!! Meanwhile, I can show you PLENTY of proof that religious belief is behind it, from the religious arguments themselves to the fact that many of these \"anti-gay Christians\" are very tolerant in other ways, such as towards black people. If it were prejudice that were behind it, it would stand to reason it would stand out more against OTHER groups too.\n \n \n \nMost efforts don't do so at the expense of the rights of a minority.\n It's just that simple. emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n ROTFLOL!!! Foundit, MOST efforts to change society is at the expense of a minority!!! \n \n - Do you not realise that drug users are a (drum roll) .... minority??\n \n - Do you just not realise that polygamists are a MINORITY??? \n \n - Do you not realise that alcoholics are a MINORITY?? \n \n - Do you not realise that petty thieves are a minority??\n \n ALL THESE and many others are examples of where people try to change society due to their moralistic beliefs. Some of them are probably YOUR moralistic beliefs. All these are cases of discrimination, in the sense that people aren't getting to do what they want. And they could all claim to be \"harmed\" in that sense.\n \n \nIf people decided, and instituted in governmental legislation, that Christianity was detrimental to society (promulgating superstition, hindering scientific / medical advances, etc), would you think discriminating against Christianity would be \"no different\"??\n\n \n Where is there legislation instituting that gays are detrimental to society?? And frankly, if Christians at large were claiming to be \"harmed\" because they didn't get to create a whole new way of marrying that no one else does, I think you'd have a point. But they aren't. It would be sort of like if ALL Christians (as opposed to just Mormons) suddenly wanted to have polygamy marriage as a legal reality, and started claiming they were \"harmed\" for not being able to. \n \n \nSeparation of church and state.\n Legislation instituting discrimination requires a legitimate state interest.\n Just cause people think \"it's best for the country\" based on their religious beliefs doesn't mean it's a legitimate application of our democracy.\n\n \n In terms of actually CREATING LAWS (legislation) that discriminate, sure. As you should remember, I've come out against anti-gay amendments before, for example.\n \n But we both know your fight isn't limited to just opposing legislation of discrimination. a.) You want to not only redefine what constitutes marriage, but in a sense, b.) redefine what constitutes DISCRIMINATION. (Not to mention 'harm.') c.) You want to reinterpret the constitution to an anything-goes approach that would allow for gay marriage on the grounds that it doesn't expressly forbid it, specifically! And d.) yours is a cultural fight, not just a legal one.\n \n Re. your comment of SoC&S, that is too often used trivially to argue against people being able to take part in the democratic process. Just because someone is religious doesn't mean they have to stop being American, and not take part in working to change America in the way they feel is right. You don't get to take away that right just because someone is religious. We can't have an Anything-But-Religion approach in terms of why people fight for things. \n \n \nOur constitution was EXPLICITLY DESIGNED to limit the \"democratic\" nature of our government. We are a REPUBLIC, governed by a CONSTITUTION, with democratic fundamentals.\n\n \n Well what are you going to do--outlaw supporting certain candidates, put police at the voting booth door to stop people from voting on referendums, and create rules in the senate against congresspeople suggesting amendments and other legislation just 'cause it's religious voters who want them? Honestly, I don't think you've thought through the implications of your stance on this. How would you put such restrictions into place, SPECIFICALLY? 'Cause, from a practical standpoint of policing it, it's just not realistic. (Not to mention, to limit peoples' ability to take part in the process over something so subjective as trying to identify RELIGION as what's behind it is a little scary to begin with.)\n \n \nPROVE to me (not just you making claims) that Christians fight for their \"religious first amendment\" in some significant manner that is comparable in some way with their multi-million dollar lobbying efforts to discriminate against gays.\n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \"Significant\", eh? Let me guess ... that's sort of like wanting people to give you a \"compelling\" reason for something. Translation: 'I'm using a subjective term so I can claim anything you say won't measure up.' :) \n \n You know what? I'll grant you that one example you gave--the first amendment--(freedom of press and religion) isn't pushed as hard by religion. (Though why should it be?? It's not a Biblical directive of ANY kind, whereas marriage is.) But other topics ARE pushed SIGNIFICANTLY. Sorry, but preaching against divorce from the pulpit consistently IS significant. Legislation on ONE issue is ONE approach. Again there is no reason every issue should be pushed in a similar or identical approach. You're trying to make this an issue of DEGREE when it's really an issue of METHOD. \n \n \nThe actions against gays ARE PUBLIC. They are ATTACKS. They are SLANDER and LIES. It's a MULTI-MILLION dollar industry, with lobbyists...\n\n \n So all you're talking about are SPECIFICALLY Christians who lie about gays? You have no problem with them opposing gay marriage or other gay rights as long as they don't lie about gays? Frankly, I find that hard to believe, Foundit.",

   "Nope. The motivation is indeed important, and considering how much time YOU spend castigating these \"anti-gay Christians\" for their supposed 'hate', it seems you need to be taking your own advice.\n\n \n The motivation is hate. They oppose gay rights and gay inclusion, therefore they are anti-gay. \n \n \nRe. the \"harm\" thing, any moral stance--including ones you have, could be claimed as a precipitant of 'HARM' if the people experiencing it are restricted by it in some way and are so inclined to claim they are being harmed.\n\n \n Is it a moral stance, this anti-gay bs? You've been asked repeadly to expound on how it is a moral position, and you've declined, saying it's your own personal business. Yet you will continue to bring it to a debate on the rights of other people. Outrageous. But of course your fallacious argument gets more and more outrageous as you bring out the old standby diversions of pedophilia, etc., further in the post. No, harm doesn't come merely with restrictions. Harm is determined by the qualifications, the logical reasons or lack of, for or against those restrictions, and the effects. \n \n \n- It harms married people because they don't have a free enough culture to feel they can engage in adultery all they want due to the morality of others in the culture.\n\n \n What a fantasy. People chose to be married, and they make an agreement with another person. They know the monogamous nature of the institution, upon entering it. They can get out of it, if they don't feel up to it. What does this have to do with logical reasons for gay exclusion and the harm it causes?\n \n \n- It harms Christians to not be able to take a political stand from the pulpit.\n\n \n That's funny, I thought people went to church to learn about God, not to be told for whom to vote. \n \n \nIt harms would-be drug users because they are restricted from using drugs.\n\n \n It can help them, or reduce harm such as in safe injection sites.\n \n \nIn cases where gays are actually physically and quantifiably harmed, then you've got a point. But lack of marriage isn't HARM,\n\n \n Yes it is harm. Why don't you tell the child of gay parents who is stigmatized because her parents relationship is not viewed on a par with the heterosexual parents, that she isn't being harmed? You can't. Not giving a group of people equal respect for their love and relationships, for no reason, does cause harm. Harm is certainly not only physical. There is psychological harm that comes from exclusion, for no rational reason, or because of hate. This is even internalized. If people receive negative messages about themselves, over and over again, they may start to believe those messages. Not treating how we express our love with equal respect does send a negative message that this is somehow less worthy. And it's also an expression of who we are at our core. We are social creatures, we humans, and we want to be accepted, loved and included, whenever this is logical. \n \n \nany more than would-be polygamists are HARMED by not being able to get married.\n\n \n That's a different issue and situation, and a different debate. Polygamists operate as a religious cult in North America at least, and I'm not sure they want to become part of mainstream society and subject to its laws, which is perhaps much less holy than they'd like. Gay people have become part of mainstream society, and our relationships are not unlawful. Also, the only difference is the sex of two partners involved. It just behooves society to bring gay couples into full inclusion and equality, when there isn't a reason not to, and we want in. Automatically going to a non-sequitor for every argument against gay marriage, is very tiresome at this point. There is another very important difference: being in a relationship with someone of the same sex is the only way gay people can express love.\n \n \nOr pedophiles are HARMED by not being able to marry the way they want.\n\n \n Do you have any idea how offensive that is? Grrrr! If we could only write curse words here, jyoshu! Go to hell. Do NOT bring that into a discussion on gay rights. Knock it off!!\n \n \nDid I say it can't be both? No, I didn't. But you're taking a guilty-till-proven-innocent approach; if you have proof that prejudice is what's behind it instead of religious belief, by all means, prove it right here!! Meanwhile, I can show you PLENTY of proof that religious belief is behind it, from the religious arguments themselves to the fact that many of these \"anti-gay Christians\" are very tolerant in other ways, such as towards black people. If it were prejudice that were behind it, it would stand to reason it would stand out more against OTHER groups too.\n\n \n Well, no, not so, if your pet prejudice is a hobbyhorse of homophobia. The fact that something is a belief or religion doesn't mean it's not prejudice. It's prejudice because there's no reason for it, and it has negative, harmful effects on people. \n \n \nROTFLOL!!! Foundit, MOST efforts to change society is at the expense of a minority!!! \n \n - Do you not realise that drug users are a (drum roll) .... minority??\n \n - Do you just not realise that polygamists are a MINORITY??? \n \n - Do you not realise that alcoholics are a MINORITY?? \n \n - Do you not realise that petty thieves are a minority??\n\n \n And I repeat, now that you've completed a Santa's list of useless diversions, when it comes to us, it's at the expense of the only way we can express our sexuality and our love. Just as being a heterosexual is the only way a heterosexual does this.",

   "LOL. Foundit, you've been making a habit lately of being accusatory of the very things you do yourself. (Then even having the gall to be hypocrisy police!) If you want to prove your 'history' comment, you are welcome to try. Another hypocritical post on your part, as you get into side issues ALL THE TIME that are pointless. Things I point out may be pointless to YOU, because you only ever want the discussion to be framed the way YOU want and nothing else.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n Whatta crock!\n A thoroughly empty claim.\n Prove me wrong by EXPLAINING WHY the existence (or lack of) hate should be significant to this, or any other discussion.\n Explain WHY the IMPACT of the action shouldn't be much more important than the motive that brought it about.\n \n \n \nOn a related note, you've gotten into quite the habit of setting out to portray what YOU consider as a standard as the DEFACTO standard of things. Once again, we are dealing with something you just don't get to define.\n\n Whine, whine, whine...\n I put up my explanation, and I give a reason for it.\n You don't like it, supply your own. TRY to argue the point.\n You're basically NOT doing that, and emoticon_cry over the fact that you don't like how what I put out there sounds.\n \n But the LOGICAL recourse is to offer your own explanation.\n \n \n \nNope. The motivation is indeed important, and considering how much time YOU spend castigating these \"anti-gay Christians\" for their supposed 'hate', it seems you need to be taking your own advice.\n\n Okay boys and girls.\n Pay CLOSE attention.\n All Jyoshu did here is say \"no, you're wrong\", AND THAT'S IT.\n I explained WHY the presence or absence of \"hate\" is not important, and all he can do is whine that I gave a standard and then say \"no\".\n \n Furthermore, WHERE do I \"spend\" time \"castigating these 'anti-gay Christians' for their supposed 'hate'\"????\n I don't give a damn what their motivation is.\n That's your schtick.\n \n \n \nRe. the \"harm\" thing, any moral stance--including ones you have, could be claimed as a precipitant of 'HARM' if the people experiencing it are restricted by it in some way and are so inclined to claim they are being harmed.\n - It harms married people because they don't have a free enough culture to feel they can engage in adultery all they want due to the morality of others in the culture.\n\n Woah there. Don't pull a bait and switch on us...\n I am talking about ACTUAL GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTION.\n What you just described is a complaint over an OPINION.\n I have made it abundantly clear that I don't care what your opinion of \"homosexuality\" is. Just don't try to discriminate against me.\n \n If your example were to talk about limits on \"adultery\" so that a person could not be with the person they truly love, I would see that type of limitation as a \"harm\".\n \n \n \n- It harms would-be drug users because they are restricted from using drugs.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n You know, I'm talking about people who have to pay more money to make up for non-existent benefit, or being kicked out of the military and losing a job, or being prevented from adopting.\n And you try to compare that to a drug-user not being able to use drugs???\n Excuse me while I feel that preventing a heroin user is NOWHERE NEAR the same ball-park. But of course you don't even get what I'm talking about in the first place, so I'm just pointing out this glaring discrepancy to the viewing audience...\n \n \n \nIn cases where gays are actually physically and quantifiably harmed, then you've got a point. But lack of marriage isn't HARM, any more than would-be polygamists are HARMED by not being able to get married.\n\n Actually, it is a harm.\n Do you have any idea of how much money a gay couple would have to shell out to get the equivalent \"benefits\" that a married couple would automatically get?\n The harm is in the increased $$$.\n \n How about I charge you a few thousand extra for your life and see if you can detect a difference...\n \n \n \nOr pedophiles are HARMED by not being able to marry the way they want.\n\n Ahh yes.\n I guess it's been too long before somebody tried to compare a consensual adult relationship to child rape.\n Obviously, the pedophile is \"harmed\" because he can't force a kid who isn't mature enough to consent into a \"marriage\"... emoticon_ic\n \n \n \n\"HARM\" is a concept that needs to be quantifiable for it really mean anything. Otherwise it's just a rhetorical statement of subjectivity.\n\n Money is entirely quantifiable.\n Losing your job to prejudice is quantifiable.\n Being prevented from adopting a child is quantifiable.\n You just don't want to look at the REAL HARM that gays experience...\n \n \n \nDid I say it can't be both? No, I didn't. But you're taking a guilty-till-proven-innocent approach; if you have proof that prejudice is what's behind it instead of religious belief, by all means, prove it right here!!\n\n I invite the viewing audience to notice how Jyoshu starts out saying that he \"didn't say\" that it couldn't be both.\n BUT IN THE VERY NEXT SENTENCE he establishes mutual exclusivity by asking for proof of \"prejudice ... INSTEAD OF RELIGIOUS BELIEF\". \n \n Does THAT sound like a guy who understands that a religious belief CAN BE a prejudice? emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nMeanwhile, I can show you PLENTY of proof that religious belief is behind it...\n\n ROFLMAO!!!\n Oh my heavens. The irony.\n Jyoshu? STOP AND THINK!\n I have been pointing out OVER and OVER again that these anti-gay organizations are RELIGIOUSLY BASED.\n \n Do you think I need \"plenty of proof\" for that thing?\n And can you stop and think how you have FOUGHT me pointing that out????\n \n \n \nIf it were prejudice that were behind it, it would stand to reason it would stand out more against OTHER groups too.\n\n No.\n There is no \"reason\" for why a person that is prejudiced against gays would also have to be prejudiced against blacks or Jews.\n Just because a person is tolerant towards blacks or Jews does not mean that he isn't prejudiced against gays.\n \n \n \nMost efforts don't do so at the expense of the rights of a minority.\n\n \nROTFLOL!!! Foundit, MOST efforts to change society is at the expense of a minority!!! \n\n blah, blah, blah...\n I have emphasized the important part of my comment that Jyoshu boringly ignores...\n Jyoshu turns around and shows how some groups, which would be \"minorities\", have certain restrictions.\n But drug use is not a right.\n Marrying multiple women is not a right.\n Alcoholics drinking alcohol is not a right.\n \n As usual, he tries to misrepresent my point by ignoring what I REALLY said...\n \n \n \nAnd they could all claim to be \"harmed\" in that sense.\n\n They \"could all claim\" to be harmed...\n A drug user could claim he is \"harmed\" by not taking a drug that will most likely turn him into an addict.\n An alcoholic is \"harmed\" by what??? Not letting him get behind the wheel of a car?\n \n Jyoshu is trying to ignore REAL HARM to gay people by comparing it to drug addicts claims of \"harm\"????\n \n \n \nWhere is there legislation instituting that gays are detrimental to society??\n\n I swear. Do you READ the threads you post on???\n There have been NUMEROUS threads and NUMEROUS posts on how some people claim gays are \"detrimental to society\".\n Nitwits on the 11:00 news claim that gay marriage will cause Sodom and Ghomorrah results.\n There was a public meeting on legislation to prevent EMPLOYMENT discrimination against gays, and there are people in the audience holding up signs that say \"protect our children\"... \n \n Do I really need to remind you of all this junk?\n \n \n \nAnd frankly, if Christians at large were claiming to be \"harmed\" because they didn't get to create a whole new way of marrying that no one else does, I think you'd have a point.\n\n Wow. Talk about rewriting reality on a continual basis.\n The \"harm\" to gays is not because \"we don't get to create a whole new way of marrying that no one else does\"...\n I don't think ANYBODY has ever made that argument, but I can understand why you would want to put forth that grotesque misrepresentation...\n \n \n \nIn terms of actually CREATING LAWS (legislation) that discriminate, sure. As you should remember, I've come out against anti-gay amendments before, for example.\n\n How many times do I have to point out that \"creating laws\" IS MY POINT?\n \n \n \nBut we both know your fight isn't limited to just opposing legislation of discrimination. a.) You want to not only redefine what constitutes marriage, but in a sense, b.) redefine what constitutes DISCRIMINATION. (Not to mention 'harm.') c.) You want to reinterpret the constitution to an anything-goes approach that would allow for gay marriage on the grounds that it doesn't expressly forbid it, specifically! And d.) yours is a cultural fight, not just a legal one.\n\n I would LOVE for you to actually DEBATE what you just said, but I think everybody here, including the viewing audience, recognizes those as claims that are tossed out there and routinely slunk away from...\n a) Not allowing gays to marry IS discrimination.\n b) There is no \"redefinition of what constitutes discrimination\".\n I challenge you to give substance to your claim.\n c) What you just said has NO resemblance to my actual argument. I am not for \"anything-goes\". I have NEVER claimed that we should recognize gay marriage cause the constitution \"doesn't expressly forbid it, specifically\".\n d) Again, HOW MANY TIMES do I have to tell you that I do not care what people's OPINIONS of gays are, but rather the DISCRIMINATION is the issue...\n \n Can you write the last one down for me?\n \n \n \nRe. your comment of SoC&S, that is too often used trivially to argue against people being able to take part in the democratic process.\n\n No. No it isn't.\n I think the easiest way to refute that junk is to flip the situation around.\n For example, for a pastor getting up in the pulpit telling his church who to vote for...\n That should be just as against the law as a congressman getting up and telling people who should be elected as next leader of a church.\n \n If you want to allow one, then the other has to be allowed.\n \n The RESPONSE to SoC&S is typically to try and misrepresent the situation and pretend it's about \"against people being able to take part in the democratic process\"...\n But the falseness of that is easily disproven!\n \n Do we stop a pastor from talking politics in NON-RELIGIOUS SETTINGS, while he is acting as a PRIVATE CITIZEN and not a religious leader???\n No.\n \n \n \nWell what are you going to do--outlaw supporting certain candidates, put police at the voting booth door to stop people from voting on referendums, and create rules in the senate against congresspeople suggesting amendments and other legislation just 'cause it's religious voters who want them?\n\n emoticon_wow\n How our GOVERNMENT handles that situation is that a COURT OF LAW reviews the law, analyzes it to see if it has any legitimate state interest beyond religious justification, and if the answer is \"no\" the law gets tossed out.\n \n I never said anything about \"just 'cause it's religious voters who want them\". emoticon_xdonno\n You are in FULL on strawman hyper hyperbolic mode...\n \n \n \nHonestly, I don't think you've thought through the implications of your stance on this.\n\n Why?\n Cause I'm talking about something OUR EXISTING GOVERNMENT already has in place and already deals with???\n Yeah. Silly me. I don't know how I'm going to accomplish that... emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \n\"Significant\", eh? Let me guess ... that's sort of like wanting people to give you a \"compelling\" reason for something. Translation: 'I'm using a subjective term so I can claim anything you say won't measure up.' :) \n\n I just want something that stacks up next to the multiple multi-million dollar lobbying Christian anti-gay organizations that work tirelessly to slander and malign gays, and try to ensure that we are discriminated by our government.\n \n The point was if you turned around and said \"Our pastor mentioned that we should worship the true god\" in his last sermon, obviously that is not \"significant\" in comparison.\n \n But yet again, you offer a meaningless complaint without even looking at the point involved. Whining that I used a word without even bothering to think WHY its necessary.\n \n \n \nYou know what? I'll grant you that one example you gave--the first amendment--(freedom of press and religion) isn't pushed as hard by religion. (Though why should it be?? It's not a Biblical directive of ANY kind, whereas marriage is.) But other topics ARE pushed SIGNIFICANTLY.\n\n Actually, I meant to say \"first commandment\".\n I want an example of churches pushing \"the first commandment\" to any relevant degree that is analogous to the multiple multi-million dollar lobbying Christian anti-gay organizations that work tirelessly to slander and malign gays, and try to ensure that we are discriminated by our government.\n \n \n \nSorry, but preaching against divorce from the pulpit consistently IS significant.\n\n Actually, I wanted proof.\n Not just you repeating some vague undocumented claim.\n \n \n \nLegislation on ONE issue is ONE approach.\n\n Um... HELLO???\n Over the years, this PREDOMINANTLY CHRISTIAN nation has made it EASIER AND EASIER to get a divorce.\n Not tougher.\n \n If you want to show multiple multi-million dollar christian organizations lobbying for THAT to change, then please show it.\n Otherwise, I think your example works more for me...\n \n \n \nAgain there is no reason every issue should be pushed in a similar or identical approach.\n\n OMG!\n Can you keep this in perspective and REMEMBER what we're talking about???\n I have been saying OVER and OVER again that there is a HUGE Christian push to fixate on the \"gay\" sin, while they effectively ignore other sins.\n \n In my request, I made it clear that I wasn't looking for anything \"identical\".\n But if your \"not similar\" is actually meaning \"nowhere near the same level as Christians push the 'gay' issue\", then my point remains. \n \n \n \nYou're trying to make this an issue of DEGREE when it's really an issue of METHOD.\n\n You know, you can point out a different \"method\" if you like, but I'll keep on reminding people why \"DEGREE\" is so darn important.\n If I spend MANY MILLIONS of dollars, through multiple organizations, to ensure drug screening, drug prosecution, education programs, federal enforcement, etc, etc on heroin prosecutions...\n ... but then I turn around and JUST toss up an occasional poster which says \"don't do cocaine\"...\n \n Then obviously I am FIXATED on heroin, and I am virtually ignoring cocaine.\n And you whining about \"method\" is NOT addressing that... emoticon_ic\n \n \n \nSo all you're talking about are SPECIFICALLY Christians who lie about gays? You have no problem with them opposing gay marriage or other gay rights as long as they don't lie about gays? Frankly, I find that hard to believe, Foundit.\n\n Good. Cause I never said that.\n I have never understood why some people (not referencing anybody) think it is \"okay\" to malign a GROUP, but more wrong to malign specific individuals.\n If I said \"Chris goofs off while he should be doing work\", and if that's not true, I have committed libel.\n I think it should be just as prosecutable if somebody says \"Gays goof off while they should be doing work\", if the charge warrants prosecution.\n \n Like the anti-gay slanderers who try to malign gays as child molestors with lies? If they named a SPECIFIC GAY MAN with a false charge, they could be brought up in a court.\n But just claiming \"gays\" is much looser.",

   "Prove me wrong by EXPLAINING WHY the existence (or lack of) hate should be significant to this, or any other discussion. Explain WHY the IMPACT of the action shouldn't be much more important than the motive that brought it about.\n\n \n Because getting to the REASONS for why something is happening is important to preventing it. It's important for learning how to deal with it, and figuring out of it's something that should be even dealt with in the first place. \"Harm\" is something ANYONE could claim on the basis of not getting something they want. Again, there's no quantifiable difference between YOU saying you're harmed by not getting marriage and a polygamist saying THEY are being harmed by it. Just saying you're harmed, ALONE, isn't enough, and quite simply won't fly. It's important to look more deeply into the issue.\n \n \nWhine, whine, whine...\n I put up my explanation, and I give a reason for it.\n You don't like it, supply your own. TRY to argue the point.\n You're basically NOT doing that, and emoticon_cry over the fact that you don't like how what I put out there sounds.\n\n \n I'll remember that the next time you make such a big deal over trying to point out a double standard, 'cause it's something you whine about quite often.\n \n \nWoah there. Don't pull a bait and switch on us...\n\n \n Who is this \"US\" you're talking about? This is about YOU and where YOU're focus is wrong. This isn't me against you and others; frankly, I doubt you're going to find too many allies that agree with you on this idea of yours that it doesn't matter if people hate gays or not ... that all that matters is the end result. (Jake has already weighed in, in fact, and shown it DOES matter to him.) But if you really want to prove it's an \"us\" thing, by all means, do a poll and see how many agree with you that hate doesn't matter. :) You back yourself into a corner with these silly and outlandish things you say, and them backpedal over and over trying to pretend you didn't say what you said. \n \n \nI am talking about ACTUAL GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTION.\n What you just described is a complaint over an OPINION.\n I have made it abundantly clear that I don't care what your opinion of \"homosexuality\" is. Just don't try to discriminate against me.\n\n \n So it's all just government restriction, huh? How about telling WHAT restrictions you're talking about? SPECIFICS, Foundit, SPECFICS. WHAT constitutes a \"government restriction\" to you? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\n \n Let me give you a couple of possibilities, to help you get started ...\n \n - sodomy laws (Doh, already gone!)\n \n - Federal anti-gay marriage amendment (doh, doesn't exist and probably never will!)\n \n Do tell ... what sort of \"restriction\" legislation are you referring to? 'Cause, in case you haven't noticed, there hasn't really needed to BE restrictions SPECIFYING gays to have them discriminated against. Marriage is understood to be no more be between a man and man than it is between a man and rhino, and it doesn't need to spell out every single thing it DOESN'T cover for that to be the case. \n \n I also find it absolutely astounding that you're taking the tact here that ALL you care about about legal restrictions. It's as if a parent wants to take a stand against a school for mistreating it's students, but ONLY taking the approach of being concerned with the letter of the rules they have down that restricts the students. No looking into the way the teachers are acting; no looking into a culture of hate ... (Oh, I forgot, we're not supposed to use that word now!) Fix the rules and it will fix EVERYTHING ...\n \n \nIf your example were to talk about limits on \"adultery\" so that a person could not be with the person they truly love, I would see that type of limitation as a \"harm\".\n\n \n Really???? 'Cause someone can claim to \"truly love\" the person they're committing adultery with. Incidentally, this idea that law should be based on \"true love\" is an awfully subjective concept. I suppose we should just plug 'em up to the Love-O-Meter and see if it's real love or not. After all, a 15 year old could claim \"real love\" with a 20 year old, and maybe even HAVE real love, but such a marriage is still not allowed.\n \n \nYou know, I'm talking about people who have to pay more money to make up for non-existent benefit, or being kicked out of the military and losing a job, or being prevented from adopting.\n And you try to compare that to a drug-user not being able to use drugs???\n\n \n Yep. Drug users get kicked out of the military, can lose their lobs, and can't adopt. Gee, the analogy fits better and better every time you comment on it, Foundit. :-)\n \n \nActually, it is a harm.\n Do you have any idea of how much money a gay couple would have to shell out to get the equivalent \"benefits\" that a married couple would automatically get?\n The harm is in the increased $$$. How about I charge you a few thousand extra for your life and see if you can detect a difference...\n\n \n Then it's \"harm\" anybody could claim that wants to marry a different way than the accepted standard. If you're truly concerned about people not being HARMED in this case, you'd need to open marriage up to any such claim someone ever made.\n \n \nAhh yes.\n I guess it's been too long before somebody tried to compare a consensual adult relationship to child rape.\n Obviously, the pedophile is \"harmed\" because he can't force a kid who isn't mature enough to consent into a \"marriage\"... emoticon_ic\n\n \n And you were chastising someone just the other day about taking ANALOGIES in different ways than it was being used for the current context. I suppose you're ready to stop the offensive comparisons of \"anti-gay Christians\" to the KKK now since you're now crying foul?\n \n \nNo.\n There is no \"reason\" for why a person that is prejudiced against gays would also have to be prejudiced against blacks or Jews.\n Just because a person is tolerant towards blacks or Jews does not mean that he isn't prejudiced against gays.\n\n \n Glad you disagree with the 'ol \"scratch-a-homophobe,find-a-racist\" mentality. \n \n \nblah, blah, blah...\n I have emphasized the important part of my comment that Jyoshu boringly ignores...\n Jyoshu turns around and shows how some groups, which would be \"minorities\", have certain restrictions.\n But drug use is not a right.\n Marrying multiple women is not a right.\n Alcoholics drinking alcohol is not a right.\n\n \n Say WHAAA???? Neither has been gay marriage. Heavens to betsy, Foundit, if the fact something isn't a right is used against it being made a right, NO civil rights would EVER have been granted since the founding of this country.\n \n \nI swear. Do you READ the threads you post on???\n There have been NUMEROUS threads and NUMEROUS posts on how some people claim gays are \"detrimental to society\".\n\n \n I thought you just said you are talking about RESTRICTIONS AGAINST GAYS--legislation. Ooops .. you forgot that, didn't you Foundit? LOL Why don't you just pack this in, cause frankly, you're contradicting yourself to the point of absurdity now. Claims on message boards aren't restrictions against gays, Foundit. You didn't think I was going to just let you get away with this switcharoo, did you? \n \n \nHow many times do I have to point out that \"creating laws\" IS MY POINT?\n\n \n DOH!!! Now we're back to LEGISLATION again, after you JUST USED posts on message boards as an example!!!! emoticon_wowemoticon_wowemoticon_frazzledemoticon_xdonno Good lord. You're literally going in circles, chasing your tail at this point.\n \n \n Again, HOW MANY TIMES do I have to tell you that I do not care what people's OPINIONS of gays are, but rather the DISCRIMINATION is the issue...\n\n \n That's not what I said. I said we both know you opposition isn't limited to LEGISLATION of discrimination, which you've given indication here IS your beef. If legislation were all you were concerned with, you really wouldn't have that much to oppose. Very little legislation has passed that is intentionally out to get gays, and most of what is against them has been overturned, e.g. sodomy laws. \n \n \nThe RESPONSE to SoC&S is typically to try and misrepresent the situation and pretend it's about \"against people being able to take part in the democratic process\"...\n But the falseness of that is easily disproven!\n \n Do we stop a pastor from talking politics in NON-RELIGIOUS SETTINGS, while he is acting as a PRIVATE CITIZEN and not a religious leader???\n No.\n\n \n Then again, specify to what extent you'd limit people with SoCS. How would you do it and what would you prevent them from doing SPECIFICALLY? Because on one hand you use examples like pastors acting in \"religious settings\" as opposed to \"private citizens\", but then on the other hand so much of what you say seems to be all up in arms over ORGANIZATIONS, which don't take place inside a church on Sundays. You use vague talking-points phrases like \"morality shouldn't be imposed\" (a CLASSIC gay activism statement), but don't define what that entails. Oh but you did say you were ONLY talking about legislation, but what if a pastor fights for said legislation as a PRIVATE CITIZEN? There are so many holes in what you're saying here, it just isn't going to stay afloat.\n \n \nI just want something that stacks up next to the multiple multi-million dollar lobbying Christian anti-gay organizations that work tirelessly to slander and malign gays, and try to ensure that we are discriminated by our government.\n\n \n The point was if you turned around and said \"Our pastor mentioned that we should worship the true god\" in his last sermon, obviously that is not \"significant\" in comparison.[/quote]\n \n Of course you aren't going to say it's 'significant'--that's exactly what I predicted, remember? A pastor could preach on it every day for 10 years straight, and you'd say it wasn't as significant. Because you're ignoring the FACT it's about differences in METHOD and not DEGREE. This is like expecting gays to only follow ONE path to getting what they are wanting. And then trying to call them hypocrites because one method happens to require more money than the other.\n \n \nActually, I meant to say \"first commandment\".\n I want an example of churches pushing \"the first commandment\" to any relevant degree that is analogous to the multiple multi-million dollar lobbying Christian anti-gay organizations that work tirelessly to slander and malign gays, and try to ensure that we are discriminated by our government.\n\n \n I've heard FAR, FAR more teaching and emphasis placed on THAT than the issue of gays.\n \n You know what the problem is here? The problem is that the anti-gay groups are what YOU HAPPEN TO SEE. Because that's the issue that most affects you. The only way you could get a fair picture of what is made priority by Christians is if you WENT TO CHURCH regularly and was truly involved in Christianity. I have never disputed that some Christians have their priorities in the wrong place. As long as you don't generalize that other CHristians and try and use it to find fault with all the REST of them, why would I have any problem with that? *I* don't think people should lie about gays and lobby against them either so why you're tying to pick a fight over this is beyond me. It all has to do with which groups you're talking about. MOST Christians don't make you a focus, Foundit. Hate to break it to ya, but you all are just 'not all that.' You're one doctrinal issue among many, and just because some fringe Christian groups spread lies about you doesn't mean the all other Christians are out to get you.\n \n \nUm... HELLO???\n Over the years, this PREDOMINANTLY CHRISTIAN nation has made it EASIER AND EASIER to get a divorce.\n Not tougher\n\n \n So now it's \"a Christian NATION\" you're talking about, eh? I swear .... you just don't believe in PERMANENTLY mounted goalposts, do you?",

   "Because getting to the REASONS for why something is happening is important to preventing it.\n\n 1) I think you just gave EVEN MORE reason why you shouldn't care about whether or not it's \"hate\", cause you obviously have no desire to \"prevent\" your fellow Christians from their anti-gay antics.\n You have NO desire to change their mind, so obviously this interest in \"hate\" is not based in the excuse you just threw out there...\n \n 2) A while back I mentioned that over many years of online discussion on the gay issue, I have only seen a handful of people change their position online, due to online influence.\n There are a variety of ways that people do change their opinions. Having somebody personal come out as gay is a good one, cause it makes people stop and question their own approach in a very real way.\n I'm sorry, but allowing you to side-track the conversation to \"hate\" for an excuse you obviously don't even accept yourself is not going to change anybody's minds here...\n \n \n \n\"Harm\" is something ANYONE could claim on the basis of not getting something they want. Again, there's no quantifiable difference between YOU saying you're harmed by not getting marriage and a polygamist saying THEY are being harmed by it. Just saying you're harmed, ALONE, isn't enough, and quite simply won't fly.\n\n Quite frankly, I just explained HOW gays are actually harmed.\n It's not an issue of \"just saying I'm harmed\". I EXPLAIN HOW.\n So how about you pay attention instead of throwing out all these pointless strawmans...\n \n \n \nI'll remember that the next time you make such a big deal over trying to point out a double standard, 'cause it's something you whine about quite often.\n\n Talk about changing the goal-posts.\n I was just pointing out that you were JUST COMPLAINING that I had offered an explanation.\n You weren't showing ANY \"double standard\" there...\n Try to remember what your ACTUAL complaint was, 'mmmkay?\n \n \n \nWho is this \"US\" you're talking about? This is about YOU and where YOU're focus is wrong. This isn't me against you and others; frankly, I doubt you're going to find too many allies that agree with you on this idea of yours that it doesn't matter if people hate gays or not ... that all that matters is the end result.\n\n Again, I find it amusing how you will comment to other people like Ethmi about me, but when the favor is returned you cry up a storm...\n And I think you'd be surprised regarding \"allies\". Just cause people don't want to respond to your repeatedly transparent techniques doesn't mean they do so out of disinterest.\n \n And if they disagree with me on the \"end result\" vs \"hate\", they are more than welcome to voice their opinion.\n IF they wanted to talk to you about \"hate\", they are perfectly capable of doing so.\n But since they obviously ARE NOT, maybe you can get back to the REAL meat of the issue instead of laying out excuses you obviously have no interest in yourself.\n \n \n \nSo it's all just government restriction, huh? How about telling WHAT restrictions you're talking about? SPECIFICS, Foundit, SPECFICS. WHAT constitutes a \"government restriction\" to you? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\n\n emoticon_wow\n Why do you ask questions to that I have already repeatedly explained?\n Gays not serving in the military. Gays not being able to adopt. Outlawing sodomy.\n Even specifying what gender you can marry is a discrimination.\n \n Why don't you stop spending so much time trying to think up your next lame excuse and realize what has already been explained to you...\n \n \n \nLet me give you a couple of possibilities, to help you get started ...\n - sodomy laws (Doh, already gone!)\n - Federal anti-gay marriage amendment (doh, doesn't exist and probably never will!)\n\n I think the point of this thread stretches WELL BEYOND just the fact that we may have ALREADY SUCCEEDED on some point, or that we are CONTINUALLY SUCCEEDING in blocking another.\n \n \n \nDo tell ... what sort of \"restriction\" legislation are you referring to? 'Cause, in case you haven't noticed, there hasn't really needed to BE restrictions SPECIFYING gays to have them discriminated against. Marriage is understood to be no more be between a man and man than it is between a man and rhino, and it doesn't need to spell out every single thing it DOESN'T cover for that to be the case.\n\n I would include gay marriage as an example as well.\n I am not sure, based on your reply, what point you think you are making whereby the government \"not specifying gays\" means that it isn't a valid example. \n \n \n \nI also find it absolutely astounding that you're taking the tact here that ALL you care about about legal restrictions. It's as if a parent wants to take a stand against a school for mistreating it's students, but ONLY taking the approach of being concerned with the letter of the rules they have down that restricts the students. No looking into the way the teachers are acting; no looking into a culture of hate ... (Oh, I forgot, we're not supposed to use that word now!) Fix the rules and it will fix EVERYTHING ...\n\n Yeah.\n Obviously EVERY OTHER STATEMENT I have ever made to you goes right out the window in discussing my interest on EVERY ASPECT of gay treatment.\n Quit trying to nitpick my words to insane ends.\n \n The point is, and always has been, that the EMOTION that leads to people wanting to discriminate against gays is irrelevant compared to the ACTION involved.\n \n \n \nReally???? 'Cause someone can claim to \"truly love\" the person they're committing adultery with. Incidentally, this idea that law should be based on \"true love\" is an awfully subjective concept. I suppose we should just plug 'em up to the Love-O-Meter and see if it's real love or not. After all, a 15 year old could claim \"real love\" with a 20 year old, and maybe even HAVE real love, but such a marriage is still not allowed.\n\n Wow.\n Considering I never said ANY of that... emoticon_frazzled\n And I never intimated that such a restriction should NEVER have ANY limits...\n You know I support age of consent legislation.\n \n Are you even interested in what my position ACTUALLY is, or should I just take it as read that no matter what I say you're going to look for some pointless way to twist it?\n \n \n \nYep. Drug users get kicked out of the military, can lose their lobs, and can't adopt. Gee, the analogy fits better and better every time you comment on it, Foundit. \n\n Drug users get kicked out FOR A REASON Jyoshu. A LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST exists.\n The efforts against gays are based in prejudice, with no legitimate state interest.\n \n Are you ACTUALLY trying to argue that the reasoning behind preventing drug users from adopting \"fits better and better\" with the reasoning for why some people don't want gays to adopt?\n \n Wow. I'm book-marking this one.\n \n \n \nThen it's \"harm\" anybody could claim that wants to marry a different way than the accepted standard. If you're truly concerned about people not being HARMED in this case, you'd need to open marriage up to any such claim someone ever made.\n\n There are some limits that the \"harm\" could be claimed, but semantics is pointless.\n The \"harm\" is weighed against a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST.\n There is a legitimate state interest in preventing PEDOPHILE marriage.\n \n I have to laugh, cause just a little while earlier I was talking about how the REASONING for people's actions (i.e. is it hate) was irrelevant.\n You argued that we needed to know the MOTIVATION to solve the problem.\n And here, you are doing your damndest to ignore the MOTIVATION behind these issues, to ignore the fact that the MOTIVATION is significantly different behind protecting a child from a child rapist, and having two consenting adults.\n \n Again, you're contradictory in your approach. In the first case, obviously trying to sidetrack the discussion.\n In the second, refusing to note the significant difference which demonstrates why ONE form of restriction SHOULD and WILL always exist, and the other should be done away with...\n \n \n \nAnd you were chastising someone just the other day about taking ANALOGIES in different ways than it was being used for the current context. I suppose you're ready to stop the offensive comparisons of \"anti-gay Christians\" to the KKK now since you're now crying foul?\n\n Jyoshu, pedophiles RAPE KIDS.\n That is nothing like gays.\n \n I hold to the idea that the anti-gay crowd can be likened to the KKK.\n And by that, I am talking about the modern KKK. Not the hang 'em from the trees KKK.\n If you're objecting to an insinuation that the current anti-gay crowd actively pursues violence against gays, that is not my point.\n \n \n \nGlad you disagree with the 'ol \"scratch-a-homophobe,find-a-racist\" mentality.\n\n While I think there is some overlap, cause they are both based in ignorance, there is no reason to assume an exclusive relationship.\n For Pete's sake! About 40% of this country opposes both civil unions / gay marriages. Would that mean that 40% are racist? emoticon_frazzled\n \n Is THAT what you are saying?\n Cause it seems obvious by your reply that you are intending to drop the supposition that YOU presented...\n \n \n \nSay WHAAA???? Neither has been gay marriage.\n\n But MARRIAGE HAS ALWAYS been a right.\n I have a solid argument for why gay marriage should be recognized as unconstitutional to discriminate against.\n Three state courts agree with me on this.\n We could argue the legal thought behind the issue, but I don't think you really want to do that cause you KNOW I have a point.\n \n That is NOTHING LIKE \"drug use\" being a right.\n That is NOTHING LIKE \"alcohol use\" being a right.\n \n \n \nHeavens to betsy, Foundit, if the fact something isn't a right is used against it being made a right, NO civil rights would EVER have been granted since the founding of this country.\n\n Again, I didn't say that.\n Is it my imagination or is he not even understanding what I'm saying?\n The point is that marriage IS a right.\n I don't have to \"make it\" a right. Marriage is ALREADY RECOGNIZED as a right.\n Not true for alcohol or drug use.\n \n Nice try to shift the goal-posts there...\n \n \n \nI thought you just said you are talking about RESTRICTIONS AGAINST GAYS--legislation. Ooops .. you forgot that, didn't you Foundit? LOL Why don't you just pack this in, cause frankly, you're contradicting yourself to the point of absurdity now. Claims on message boards aren't restrictions against gays, Foundit. You didn't think I was going to just let you get away with this switcharoo, did you?\n\n emoticon_wow\n Maybe you should come back in a day or two after you've had time to cool your jets, cause you're all over the place.\n \n I was responding TO YOUR QUESTION. YOU raised that question. NOT me.\n YOU said: \"Where is there legislation instituting that gays are detrimental to society??\"\n No \"switcheroo\" here except in the case that I was simply answering YOUR QUESTION, and all of a sudden you claim a \"contradiction\"?\n HOW is me pointing out that some anti-gay Christians out there complain \"gays are detrimental to society\" contradict anything else I have said???\n emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nDOH!!! Now we're back to LEGISLATION again, after you JUST USED posts on message boards as an example!!!! \n Good lord. You're literally going in circles, chasing your tail at this point.\n\n I never left that point.\n And it's interesting to note that in your frantic efforts to pretend a \"contradiction\", you are completely ignoring my points...\n \n \n \nThat's not what I said. I said we both know you opposition isn't limited to LEGISLATION of discrimination, which you've given indication here IS your beef. If legislation were all you were concerned with, you really wouldn't have that much to oppose. Very little legislation has passed that is intentionally out to get gays, and most of what is against them has been overturned, e.g. sodomy laws.\n\n My LEGAL opposition is related to that.\n Doesn't mean I won't pause and point out how futile and stupid homophobes are being.\n But that's more of just a hobby... ;) \n \n The point is that I am not intending to LEGISLATE any action against homophobes for their own INDIVIDUAL and PRIVATE opinions.\n \n \n \nThen again, specify to what extent you'd limit people with SoCS.\n\n Ugh.\n Jyoshu?\n Knock it off.\n I support the status quo, which you obviously know nothing about.\n I have repeatedly, in the past and I will in the future, talked about separation of church and state applications.\n If you want to discuss THE STATUS QUO of separation of church and state, we can do so in the religious thread.\n But if it's just going to turn into me trying to educate you when you aren't even going to listen in the first place, I'm not going to be that interested... emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nYou use vague talking-points phrases like \"morality shouldn't be imposed\" (a CLASSIC gay activism statement), but don't define what that entails.\n\n Jyoshu, WHERE did I say that?\n That doesn't sound like me at all.\n It DOES sound like how you would misrepresent me.\n \n My \"talking-point\", if you will, is that RELIGION shouldn't be imposed.\n \n \n \nOh but you did say you were ONLY talking about legislation, but what if a pastor fights for said legislation as a PRIVATE CITIZEN? There are so many holes in what you're saying here, it just isn't going to stay afloat.\n\n These aren't \"holes\".\n You're just tossing out stupid junk and not even waiting for me to answer.\n You refuse to even recognize I am talking about SUPPORTING EXISTING STATUS QUO which already differentiates between stuff like this.\n Before I answer, even though what I say won't matter, DO YOU EVEN KNOW how the current status quo differentiates between a pastor fighting for legislation from the pulpit, and fighting for legislation \"as a private citizen\"????\n \n I honestly think you don't even care.\n You're just trying to \"get me\" and you're flailing away with noisy desparation, but you're not even listening to what I say.\n \n \n \nOf course you aren't going to say it's 'significant'--that's exactly what I predicted, remember?\n\n Hey Jyoshu.\n Do you have any predictions on going outside while its raining with no umbrella and getting wet?\n Cause that's a DOOZY of a tough one, ain't it....\n < end sarcasm <\n \n Why don't you stop with \"predictions\" of the obvious THAT YOU CAN'T ARGUE and actually try to argue the point?\n The real issue is that you don't want to admit that the church pays AN INCREDIBLY HIGHER FOCUS to the \"gay issues\" than to other issues like \"first commandment\".\n \n And if on one side we have MULTIPLE MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR ANTI-GAY ORGANIZATIONS, who are explicitly trying to LEGISLATE discrimination against gays...\n ... and on the other side we have *my pastor side we should all worship Christ when he was in the pulpit*...\n \n THEN MY POINT IS PROVEN.\n Obviously, having MULTIPLE MULTI-MILLION dollar anti-gay organizations trying to legislate against gays IS NOWHERE NEAR a pastor just saying something from the pulpit.\n \n And quite frankly, I take full blame for presenting an argument that you knew was coming, cause I OBVIOUSLY HAVE GIVEN IT BEFORE.\n How DARE I do that, huh????\n \n This is all very simple.\n If you want to argue that the anti-gay Christian focus is anywhere near the first commandment Christian focus, THEN PRESENT CONVINCING ARGUMENTS on the issue.\n Don't just compare a flood to a beaker of water, and pretend that you've shown some level of similarity... \n \n \n \nA pastor could preach on it every day for 10 years straight, and you'd say it wasn't as significant.\n\n 1) That's not true.\n 2) How about we talk about reality.\n How about we talk about how the church DOES approach the first amendment issue instead of you whining about hypotheticals where I don't even give my opinion on before you presume guilt...\n \n Oh wait.\n The WHOLE POINT of this is for you to avoid addressing the real point, cause you know you can't compare the two.\n But you still want to give the pretense of it, and you want to pretend I'm not being fair in reaching an obvious conclusion you can't win... emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nYou know what the problem is here? The problem is that the anti-gay groups are what YOU HAPPEN TO SEE.\n\n OH MY GAWD you are funny.\n You said that already, and THAT IS WHY I ASKED YOU TO SHOW ME the other side.\n Funny how that works...\n \n And the truly funny thing is you STILL HAVE NOT SHOWN ME ANYTHING.\n You've been whine, whine, whine about how I'm not going to be fair to hide the fact that you CANNOT BACK UP YOUR CLAIM that the level of attention is anywhere near similar.\n \n SHOW ME Christianity's importance on the first commandment.\n Quit yer mindless belly-aching and give up the goods already!\n \n \n \nSo now it's \"a Christian NATION\" you're talking about, eh? I swear .... you just don't believe in PERMANENTLY mounted goalposts, do you?\n\n emoticon_wow\n You mention \"divorce\"...\n I show how that example actually COUNTERS your point...\n And the next thing I know you're misrepresenting a phrase I didn't say, and claiming it's \"moving goalposts\"...\n And yes. You DID avoid the point that had nothing to do with the \"goalposts\" you're whining about...\n \n Must be talking to Jyoshu on a day that ends in \"y\"... emoticon_xagree",

   "The motivation is hate. They oppose gay rights and gay inclusion, therefore they are anti-gay.\n\n \n I agree that for some it is. My point is that it's not JUST the end-result that matters, which was what I was saying to Foundit. The motivation matters too. Surely you agree that it matters to determine if it's hate that's behind it.\n \n \nIs it a moral stance, this anti-gay bs? You've been asked repeadly to expound on how it is a moral position, and you've declined, saying it's your own personal business.\n\n \n It's a moralistic position because, well, it's peoples' morals. I'm not trying to tell you how to live YOUR life; you can do what you want. but don't tell me how my morals should be either.\n \n \nWhat a fantasy. People chose to be married, and they make an agreement with another person. They know the monogamous nature of the institution, upon entering it. They can get out of it, if they don't feel up to it. What does this have to do with logical reasons for gay exclusion and the harm it causes?\n\n \n I'm not arguing that married people are harmed by adultery. (They are sometimes, but that's not my point.) I'm trying to get you to see the emptiness of the whole subjective \"harm\" argument you're supporting. It's a approach to say that not getting marriage is harmful. If you're going to take that approach, then ANY sort of arrangement that is denied is a form of \"harm\".\n \n \nYes it is harm. Why don't you tell the child of gay parents who is stigmatized because her parents relationship is not viewed on a par with the heterosexual parents, that she isn't being harmed?\n\n \n I didn't say you WEREN'T harmed. But there's no onus here to prove to you what ISN'T happening. If you're making the accusation that someone is harming you, prove THAT to begin with. With specifics--quantifiable ones. It's not a valid approach to make a claim and expect everyone else to DIS-prove your claim--your claim has to be proven on YOUR part. If someone says \"the earth was created in 6 days; prove me wrong\", that's not a valid approach. Prove the 6-day claim to begin with.\n \n \nYou can't.\n\n \n I don't have to. Nor would I anyway; I've never claimed you aren't being harmed. You've missed my point if that's what you think I'm saying.\n \n \nNot giving a group of people equal respect for their love and relationships, for no reason, does cause harm.\n\n \n So ... polygamists aren't given equal respect as monogamists. Are they being harmed? \n \n \nThat's a different issue and situation, and a different debate.\n\n \n And that's a cop out. Look, you can't just take any analogy that comes along which happens to show a different side of things that the way you want them to be and wave it off as \"a different issue.\" EVERY analogy is a different issue; that's what analogies ARE: different issues used to show you something about the issue you're talking about. The claims about marriage in terms of gay marriage can be made about polygamy, and when you use universal-type sweeping arguments like \"harm\", you open yourself up to it being pointed out that we do the same thing for any number of issues. We don't need to arbitrarily assume harm, nor do we need to arbitrarily do away with something just because those who fall under that issue CLAIM to be harmed.\n \n \nPolygamists operate as a religious cult in North America at least, and I'm not sure they want to become part of mainstream society and subject to its laws, which is perhaps much less holy than they'd like.\n\n \n The same thing has been said of gays at times (not being a \"religious cult\" but that's beside any pertinent point), and there was a time it was not part of mainstream society at all. \n \n \nGay people have become part of mainstream society, and our relationships are not unlawful.\n\n \n Unlawfulness (illegality) is not a sound reason to draw a distinction either. Gay relations were unlawful at one time too.\n \n \nDo you have any idea how offensive that is? Grrrr! If we could only write curse words here, jyoshu! Go to hell. Do NOT bring that into a discussion on gay rights. Knock it off!!\n\n \n Look, sorry, but when you're dealing with an issue that is a moralistic one for many people, the only way to get you to see that is to use a moralistic one that you would agree with (as being wrong) as an analogy. I'm not arguing that gay relations = that. People have to be able to use analogies here--you can't just say 'analogies that I find offensive are off the table': it's the very fact it's OFFENSIVE to you that MAKES it analogous: it's something you consider immoral. To analogize something some people consider immoral, another immoral thing that you agree is immoral has to be used. Your personal morals may be that it's fine, and that's your business. But not everyone agrees. How else can the issue of it going against some people's morals be analogized except by using other moralistic issues? Analogies have to be read in context of the discussion. No one is saying gay relations are harmful like that. No one is saying it equates to that.\n \n \nWell, no, not so, if your pet prejudice is a hobbyhorse of homophobia. The fact that something is a belief or religion doesn't mean it's not prejudice.\n\n \n Again, you're expecting people to prove something is NOT something here--if you're making the accusation of prejudice, then the onus is on YOU to prove your accusation.",

   "1) I think you just gave EVEN MORE reason why you shouldn't care about whether or not it's \"hate\", cause you obviously have no desire to \"prevent\" your fellow Christians from their anti-gay antics.\n You have NO desire to change their mind, so obviously this interest in \"hate\" is not based in the excuse you just threw out there...\n\n \n I shouldn't need to change their mind--it's not my problem, Foundit, it's yours--you need to change their mind if you want it changed. They are not my \"fellow Christians\"; no Christian is part of some card-carrying membership. I don't think you realize the irrationality of that expectation. The ONLY common denominator all Christians have with each other is that they happen to claim to be Christians. (Heck, even within that, there are so many doctrinal issues out there, they don't even all consider the OTHER as Christians!) Your expectation is like expecting Saturn car owners to reign-in some other Saturn car owner who used his car to run over people. It's like expecting someone who's an LA Laker's fan to change the minds of another Laker's fan who's out harming other people for not being a Laker's fan. No, the Laker's fan (in such a case) that's harming people is not representative of Laker's fans, and has nothing to do with that.\n \n That's not to say I don't find it appalling as well as frustrating that some people who happen to be Christians harm other people. Some of that frustration is that I know people such as yourself will hold it over other Christians, even if it's simply in the form of using it to demand they call their \"fellow Christians\" out on the issue. I know you've said you WOULD condemn other gays for doing bad things, but I don't even think you should HAVE to. That's really more the point. \n \n \nQuite frankly, I just explained HOW gays are actually harmed.\n It's not an issue of \"just saying I'm harmed\". I EXPLAIN HOW.\n So how about you pay attention instead of throwing out all these pointless strawmans...\n\n \n If that's it, then there's nothing you've said in terms of marriage that can't also be said about other people that don't get to be married. \n \n \nWhy do you ask questions to that I have already repeatedly explained?\n Gays not serving in the military. Gays not being able to adopt. Outlawing sodomy.\n Even specifying what gender you can marry is a discrimination.\n\n \n So is it harming 17 year olds that they can't serve in the military? Is it harming ex-prisoners that they can't adopt in many cases? Sure, I can accept that's a FORM of 'harm', but I think it's a stretch. It's really more a case of just not being able to do what you want to do. If that's a form of 'harm', then so be it. You make a distinction calling yours \"REAL HARM\", but it's no different than the harm that could be claimed in any of these other cases.\n \n \nObviously EVERY OTHER STATEMENT I have ever made to you goes right out the window in discussing my interest on EVERY ASPECT of gay treatment.\n Quit trying to nitpick my words to insane ends.\n\n \n I'll remember that, the next time you yourself do that very sort of thing.\n \n \nConsidering I never said ANY of that... emoticon_frazzled\n And I never intimated that such a restriction should NEVER have ANY limits...\n You know I support age of consent legislation.\n\n \n Well that's the point. A 17 year old can easily be more mature (depending on the kid) than a given 18 year old, and VALIDLY say he can't marry the person he LOVES. Yet you support such discrimination, then argue against the discrimination of gays being unable to marry, claiming that very same reason. If you're going to use LOVE as a reason to give rights, I hope you're feeling considerably more generous with legal marriage than just with one group.\n \n \nThere are some limits that the \"harm\" could be claimed, but semantics is pointless.\n The \"harm\" is weighed against a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST.\n There is a legitimate state interest in preventing PEDOPHILE marriage.\n\n \n But the age of consent is arbitrary. Again, it doesn't reflect maturity levels in many cases, and therefore \"legitimate state interest\" is arbitrary in many cases. I'm not arguing for pedophile marriages; I'm trying to get you to see the speciousness of YOUR arguments.\n \n \nI hold to the idea that the anti-gay crowd can be likened to the KKK.\n\n \n I know you do. no doubt that you think that, believe me. Just like some hold to the offensive idea of likening gays to pedophiles. You're conflating racism and moralistic views, two things that are often not the same thing.\n \n \nWhile I think there is some overlap, cause they are both based in ignorance, there is no reason to assume an exclusive relationship.\n For Pete's sake! About 40% of this country opposes both civil unions / gay marriages. Would that mean that 40% are racist? emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n Foundit, YOU'RE the one who just said you liken it to the KKK. So OBVIOUSLY YOU think opposing gay rights is related to racism. \n \n \nBut MARRIAGE HAS ALWAYS been a right.\n \n The point is that marriage IS a right.\n I don't have to \"make it\" a right. Marriage is ALREADY RECOGNIZED as a right.\n Not true for alcohol or drug use\n\n \n But not gay marriage. I didn't say \"marriage\", I said \"gay marriage.\" Marriage between two people of the same gender has certainly NOT always been a right. It's not just MARRIAGE that these \"anti-gay Christians\" you talk of are concerned with; it's gay marriage. And that's exactly WHY other forms of marriage are pertinent here, because by invoking the general sense of marriage and relaxing the standards society has given it to allow other things in, you're using a specious argument. Alcohol use IS a right. It has some restrictions though, sort of like ..... tada! ... marriage. Ultimately you're just arguing for restrictions to be opened up more, and let one more group in.\n \n \nI have a solid argument for why gay marriage should be recognized as unconstitutional to discriminate against.\n Three state courts agree with me on this.\n We could argue the legal thought behind the issue, but I don't think you really want to do that cause you KNOW I have a point.\n\n \n Actually, I'd LOVE to hear what (other than the fact it's not expressly forbidden) your \"solid argument\" is in terms of the constitution. Because most arguments based on the 14th amendment are just THAT: the fact it doesn't expressly forbid it.\n \n \nemoticon_wow\n Maybe you should come back in a day or two after you've had time to cool your jets, cause you're all over the place.\n\n \n LOL. Foundit, that's because YOU'RE all over the place. Your goalposts have been all over the field here.\n \n \nI was responding TO YOUR QUESTION. YOU raised that question. NOT me.\n YOU said: \"Where is there legislation instituting that gays are detrimental to society??\"\n\n \n Then why didn't you answer that with a response about LEGISLATION? You didn't. You answered a question about legislation with a response about posts on a message board. :xbanghead go figure.\n \n \nNo \"switcheroo\" here except in the case that I was simply answering YOUR QUESTION, and all of a sudden you claim a \"contradiction\"?\n\n \n you didn't address the question at all. I asked you for an example of such legislation, and you responded with something about message board posts. Personally, I think it's just another case of you trying to jump all over something without really taking the time to really read what I said.\n \n \n \nJyoshu, WHERE did I say that?\n That doesn't sound like me at all.\n It DOES sound like how you would misrepresent me.\n \n My \"talking-point\", if you will, is that RELIGION shouldn't be imposed.\n\n \n Come on, get real Foundit. emoticon_rolleyes In terms of this issue, the religious view IS A MORALISTIC view, Foundit. You can't just take anything religious people believe is important and say they can't support legislation or other govt. action just because it happens to be something their religion entails. That is NOT the status quo of SoCS. If you think it IS, then it's *you* that needs to be \"educated\" on this. And frankly, that's what you seem to be saying. If it's not, then please elaborate. And the very fact it's completely legal for them to do so only goes to SHOW it's not the status quo. \n \n \nBefore I answer, even though what I say won't matter, DO YOU EVEN KNOW how the current status quo differentiates between a pastor fighting for legislation from the pulpit, and fighting for legislation \"as a private citizen\"????\n\n \n Foundit, the problem is that your use of that is inconsistent here. The problem is that YOU DON'T differentiate. It's not like you only oppose this when it comes from \"pastors in pulpits\". You think it's \"imposing religion\" even if they aren't pastors in pulpits and just members of what you call anti-gay organizations. If all that you opposed on that basis was pastors preaching from pulpits, there would be NO PROBLEM here.\n \n \nHey Jyoshu.\n Do you have any predictions on going outside while its raining with no umbrella and getting wet?\n Cause that's a DOOZY of a tough one, ain't it....\n\n \n Well, that's indeed about how likely it was that you were already planning to say it wasn't \"significant\" .... \n \n \nThe real issue is that you don't want to admit that the church pays AN INCREDIBLY HIGHER FOCUS to the \"gay issues\" than to other issues like \"first commandment\".\n\n \n No they don't. They deal with it IN DIFFERENT WAYS. I already told you that. I even gave you examples, telling you that one is dealt with via organizations and the other with teaching and preaching WITHIN the church. Gay-related issues are NOT dealt with much in preaching and teaching. You may think it is, but it's not. Go to church in most any church for awhile if you don't believe me. But you WILL hear other issues taught and preached about, such as ...... (gee!) the first commandment! Once again, you're mistaking METHOD for DEGREE.\n \n I've also already pointed out to you that you are more sensitive to one issue than the other. You HEAR one more because it's your issue. \n \n I've told you these things already and you act like none of this has been said already. You ask to be pointed to where the church deals with the 1st commandment, but that happens IN CHURCH. I can't show you unless you go and see for yourself. It's like you trying to tell me what goes on at a gay rights parade and me insisting you show me, yet not being willing to go to a parade to see for myself. Frankly, I don't think you're being fair in your approach on this.\n \n \nAnd if on one side we have MULTIPLE MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR ANTI-GAY ORGANIZATIONS, who are explicitly trying to LEGISLATE discrimination against gays...\n ... and on the other side we have *my pastor side we should all worship Christ when he was in the pulpit*...\n\n \n (Sigh... ) So much for realistic representations on your part.\n \n Have you just given up arguing with honesty? 'Cause if you want to compare the number of these anti-gay organisations with the number of churches out there with average pastors preaching, you and I both know you would lose on that one. And most churches preach and talk about OTHER issues more. You know that, so stop with the trash, Foundit. Stop portraying what I'm saying on this is just \"my pastor.\" Geez, Foundit, Rick Warren pastors a church that has 22,000 members. Do you really think he preaches anti-gay rhetoric from the pulpit more than other issues when he's even come out publicly in DEFENSE of gays? And he's just one pastor. I don't have to prove to you these churches DON'T focus on being anti-gay; you need to PROVE your accusation if you think they DO. Why do you insist on engaging in pulling this same fallacious junk? I didn't say \"MY PASTOR.\" You're just flat out being disingenuous.\n \n And then you whine 'cause some people have stopped engaging you and even put you on ignore. emoticon_rolleyes THIS sort of thing is exactly WHY that happens, Foundit. \n \n \nYou mention \"divorce\"...\n I show how that example actually COUNTERS your point...\n And the next thing I know you're misrepresenting a phrase I didn't say, and claiming it's \"moving goalposts\"...\n\n \n Sort of like portraying a statement about churches and pastors in general as just \"my-pastor-said\"? \n \n Your whole argument on all this is one colossal over-simplification to the Nth Degree. Different issues in Christendom are dealt with in different ways, but you keep insisting on IGNORING the issue of method to SOLELY try to turn this into an issue of DEGREE. I suppose we should assume that gay rights advocates all deal with every issue exactly the same, with no difference in method. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n (Wait .... that's been pointed out to you already. You just don't care.)",

   "I agree that for some it is. My point is that it's not JUST the end-result that matters, which was what I was saying to Foundit. The motivation matters too. Surely you agree that it matters to determine if it's hate that's behind it.\n\n \n Let's see if we can figure this out. Do we ever exclude people for NO STATED REASON, unless that reason is hate? The answer is no, people never do this! The person doing the hating is merely afraid to state it. It used to be that you could say you hate gays quite bluntly. Now, society has changed, and people will not be as direct, in general, for fear of looking bad themselves. Give us a reason, otherwise, you are hiding your ugly hate. The end results from the motivation behind it. It's to have a specific group of people irrationally excluded. This is not how humans work at our best!! An inclusive society is the best moralistic one! \n \n \nIt's a moralistic position because, well, it's peoples' morals.\n\n \n The morality is to hate and exclude gay people for no reason. Some morality. \n \n \nI'm not trying to tell you how to live YOUR life; you can do what you want. but don't tell me how my morals should be either.\n\n \n Your morals appeal to the lowest denominator of irrational, suspicion, fear, ignorance, exclusion and bigotry. These ought to be opposed at every possible opportunity.\n \n \nI'm not arguing that married people are harmed by adultery. (They are sometimes, but that's not my point.) I'm trying to get you to see the emptiness of the whole subjective \"harm\" argument you're supporting. It's a approach to say that not getting marriage is harmful. If you're going to take that approach, then ANY sort of arrangement that is denied is a form of \"harm\".\n\n \n Nope. Garbage. Sometimes it prevents other harm, but not in the case of gay people. Our desire to be included, unless there is a logical reason why not, is perfectly moral, sound. It does do harm to be excluded, because it feeds into the irrational fears, ignorance, prejudice, against us and our families. These are the fallacious reasons why we are excluded from marriage as well. It all feeds from the same roots or sources. It needs to be put into the dust bin of history.\n \n \nI didn't say you WEREN'T harmed. But there's no onus here to prove to you what ISN'T happening. If you're making the accusation that someone is harming you, prove THAT to begin with. With specifics--quantifiable ones. It's not a valid approach to make a claim and expect everyone else to DIS-prove your claim--your claim has to be proven on YOUR part. If someone says \"the earth was created in 6 days; prove me wrong\", that's not a valid approach. Prove the 6-day claim to begin with.\n\n \n Please. Is this America we are talking about? I thought this was the land based on equality and justice and liberty for all. That should be presumed. The onus should be on those wanting to impose on these values to provide the damn objective proof! Imagine if women or African Americans had to prove they were being harmed by not being able to vote. How about inter-racial couples or non-religious couples having to prove they were being harmed by not being included in the institution of marriage? I guess you must believe the basis is bigotry and exclusion, and anything else is an exceptional case of arguing against these values or morals.\n \n \nSo ... polygamists aren't given equal respect as monogamists. Are they being harmed?\n\n \n That's another debate. It doesn't mean we shouldn't extend equality to gay people. gay people can only love the gay way, not so with polygamists. But I know you'd like to change the subject anyway, of course. You just want to talk about these canards.\n \n \nAnd that's a cop out. Look, you can't just take any analogy that comes along which happens to show a different side of things that the way you want them to be and wave it off as \"a different issue.\"\n\n \n IT'S A COP OUT WHEN OTHER SUBJECTS ARE YOUR SOLE ARGUEMENT!!! this is definately the case with your anti-gay side.\n \n \nEVERY analogy is a different issue; that's what analogies ARE: different issues used to show you something about the issue you're talking about. The claims about marriage in terms of gay marriage can be made about polygamy, and when you use universal-type sweeping arguments like \"harm\", you open yourself up to it being pointed out that we do the same thing for any number of issues. We don't need to arbitrarily assume harm, nor do we need to arbitrarily do away with something just because those who fall under that issue CLAIM to be harmed.\n\n \n No. This issue has many differences as I've already explained. I am not going to keep going over them. You don't want to deal with any of it. Instead you put your fingers in your ears and talk about everything else. This isn't an argument. Are the polygamists asking to be legalized? No, they are not. They are not a part of our neighbourhoods and our communities. Their children do not attend the same schools. It's a cult. This conversation is moot. They are not making the claim that they are being harmed by not being legalized in marriage. Let us have that debate when and if it happens. Should we have it, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM will be the main issue. Now, if you say Christians must be married, because to not do so harms them in terms of religious freedom, why not the polygamists?\n \n \nThe same thing has been said of gays at times (not being a \"religious cult\" but that's beside any pertinent point), and there was a time it was not part of mainstream society at all.\n\n \n And there was a time when polygamy was mainstream. This was perhaps the result of religion having so much power. Once you make arguments for religious rights, you go down the road of arguing for polygamy. We are less religious today, and gay people have more rights, are more mainstream.\n \n \nUnlawfulness (illegality) is not a sound reason to draw a distinction either.\n\n \n Ha, yes, it does make a major difference.\n \n \nGay relations were unlawful at one time too.\n\n \n \"At one time\", \"at one time\", is that all you've got? A time capsule?\n \n \nLook, sorry, but when you're dealing with an issue that is a moralistic one for many people, the only way to get you to see that is to use a moralistic one that you would agree with (as being wrong) as an analogy. I'm not arguing that gay relations = that. People have to be able to use analogies here--you can't just say 'analogies that I find offensive are off the table': it's the very fact it's OFFENSIVE to you that MAKES it analogous: it's something you consider immoral.\n\n \n No, it's not analogous. There are so many differences. I hardly know where to being. My morality here is based on sound reasoning. Your morality is to hate and exclude gays for no reason.\n \n \nAgain, you're expecting people to prove something is NOT something here--if you're making the accusation of prejudice, then the onus is on YOU to prove your accusation.\n\n \n Why can't you state a reason for the exclusion, or a \"less than\" status? Is this normally the way you treat others who are in front of you, wanting to interact with you? No, if it were, we'd call such behaviour on your part, \"anti-social\". We'd say the person hates other people if this was the way he or she acted. I'm saying you hate gay people, because this is the way you act towards us, but don't want to admit it. And you use diversions for this purpose.",

   "If that's it, then there's nothing you've said in terms of marriage that can't also be said about other people that don't get to be married.\n\n \n Please. Gay couples are legal parts of communities as are our families. That's the reality. In very practical terms, we need the same protections, and also the recognition that heterosexual couples have. May we talk about that? \n \n \nSo is it harming 17 year olds that they can't serve in the military? Is it harming ex-prisoners that they can't adopt in many cases? Sure, I can accept that's a FORM of 'harm', but I think it's a stretch. It's really more a case of just not being able to do what you want to do. If that's a form of 'harm', then so be it. You make a distinction calling yours \"REAL HARM\", but it's no different than the harm that could be claimed in any of these other cases.\n\n \n No, it goes much deeper, it's more profound than gay people not being able to do what we want to do. Gays have already been highly integrated. It seems your side is arguing over very arbitrary terms. It's ok if we are given the status of domestic partner, or registered partner, or civil union, just not marriage. What's the difference? What's the reason, that we're allowed to be nearly there, but not quite there with you? There's no rational reason for it. It's a desire to instill bigotry as much and for as long as possible, holding onto it, as history changes and the bigotry wanes and equality comes in.\n \n \nWell that's the point. A 17 year old can easily be more mature (depending on the kid) than a given 18 year old, and VALIDLY say he can't marry the person he LOVES. Yet you support such discrimination, then argue against the discrimination of gays being unable to marry, claiming that very same reason. If you're going to use LOVE as a reason to give rights, I hope you're feeling considerably more generous with legal marriage than just with one group.\n \n \n But the age of consent is arbitrary. Again, it doesn't reflect maturity levels in many cases, and therefore \"legitimate state interest\" is arbitrary in many cases. I'm not arguing for pedophile marriages; I'm trying to get you to see the speciousness of YOUR arguments.\n\n \n Age of consent does reflect maturity in most cases, it's not entirely arbitrary. However this is just another diversion and a fantasy. The discussion is moot. Gay couples have been highly integrated now in our legal relationships, as I've said. That's the issue on the table now. Why can't we have marriage?\n \n \nI know you do. no doubt that you think that, believe me. Just like some hold to the offensive idea of likening gays to pedophiles. You're conflating racism and moralistic views, two things that are often not the same thing.\n\n \n Your definition of what morality is so vague, but only when it suits you to argue against gay human rights!\n \n \nBut not gay marriage. I didn't say \"marriage\", I said \"gay marriage.\" Marriage between two people of the same gender has certainly NOT always been a right. It's not just MARRIAGE that these \"anti-gay Christians\" you talk of are concerned with; it's gay marriage. And that's exactly WHY other forms of marriage are pertinent here, because by invoking the general sense of marriage and relaxing the standards society has given it to allow other things in, you're using a specious argument.

Frankly, your stubbornness on that is more like a religious fundie, who won't even listen or consider what anyone else is saying even from the standpoint of tolerance and trying to learn why some other people feel the way they feel. Of course analogies are 'different issues'; they are supposed to be. They are different issues used to show us something about the particular issue being discussed.\n \n \nLet's see if we can figure this out. Do we ever exclude people for NO STATED REASON, unless that reason is hate?\n\n \n There is certainly another reason used by some to oppose gay rights, and I've already told you what it is: religious belief and therefore not accepting the idea of validating what some doctrinally believe is inappropriate behavior. Look, you can keep your head in the sand all you want, but it's not going to change the fact that for some religious belief really is the reason behind it. THAT'S why it's important to determine motivation--it at least a.) helps you deal with what's at the heart of opposition, and b.) learn to be more tolerant of things you disagree with.\n \n \nYour morals appeal to the lowest denominator of irrational, suspicion, fear, ignorance, exclusion and bigotry. These ought to be opposed at every possible opportunity.\n\n \n No, you of all people (who oppose people telling you how to live your life) should understand the concept of not telling others what their personal morals should be.\n \n \nNope. Garbage. Sometimes it prevents other harm, but not in the case of gay people. Our desire to be included, unless there is a logical reason why not, is perfectly moral, sound.\n\n \n Sorry, but there quite simply isn't anything special about gay marriage over any other form of marriage out there that people might want. Why do you think your form of marriage is special over any other person out there that may want marriage for whatever reason?\n \n \nIt does do harm to be excluded, because it feeds into the irrational fears, ignorance, prejudice, against us .... \n\n \n Fine; it may indeed do 'harm', but then so may ANY case of not broadening marriage to include some given group. I don't see why your case should be any more special than any other.\n \n \nPlease. Is this America we are talking about? I thought this was the land based on equality and justice and liberty for all. That should be presumed. The onus should be on those wanting to impose on these values to provide the damn objective proof!\n\n \n So we should just broaden marriage to include anyone and any possible arrangement that ever comes along? No limits on it? Because this idea of yours that anything goes be default unless proven it shouldn't is pretty much wide-open, you know.\n \n \nImagine if women or African Americans had to prove they were being harmed by not being able to vote. How about inter-racial couples or non-religious couples having to prove they were being harmed by not being included in the institution of marriage?\n\n \n In point of fact, they DID have to prove it. That's why both of these examples were handled via legislation, (the 19th amendment for women's voting and the 15th Amendment / Voting Rights Act of 1965 for African Americans) rather than taking a wide-open-already approach. But even THEN, voting has FAR more constitutional basis than marriage, which is never specified by the constitution at all, whereas voting IS. \n \n \n\"At one time\", \"at one time\", is that all you've got? A time capsule?\n\n \n \"All I've got?\" It's all I need when you use illegality to defend something. If we went by your reasoning that illegality should be all that's needed to not consider change, then you'd never have gotten ANY gay rights of any kind. To argue illegality is a specious argument on your part to begin with.\n \n \n \nYour morality is to hate and exclude gays for no reason.\n \n I'm saying you hate gay people, because this is the way you act towards us, but don't want to admit it. \n\n \n And so you're flat out wrong. No, my morality is certainly not to hate you at all. I don't hate you. I also reject this absurd and irrational idea that disagreeing on the view of gay marriage = hate.

In very practical terms, we need the same protections, and also the recognition that heterosexual couples have. May we talk about that?\n\n \n Sure. I thought we already were. This is ALL a part of that discussion.\n \n \nIt's ok if we are given the status of domestic partner, or registered partner, or civil union, just not marriage. What's the difference?\n\n \n The difference, IMO, is because of what I think marriage is. IMO you can't separate the idea of marriage from to concept of opposite-sex--it's a fundamental aspect of what marriage is. To bring in other things and arrangements is to broaden it past what is a fundamental aspect of it. It's not the ONLY aspect of it, of course. \n \n On the other hand, I agree with you that you should be given equal rights constitutionally. (Gee, I'm SUCH a gay-hater thinking that, huh? emoticon_rolleyes) But what that entails is really the benefits that marriage happens to provide opposite-sex couples. They're ultimately just legality-based benefits as far as the government is concerned, so that's why I agree with the concept of giving gays civil unions. The bottom line is equality in terms of legality-based benefits. No reason to redefine marriage when that can be done a different way.\n \n \nAge of consent does reflect maturity in most cases, it's not entirely arbitrary.\n\n \n Come on, get real. I really don't think there's much difference in maturity between a 17yr+11mo. old kid and an 18 year old kid. The point is that your approach to just broaden marriage would have to apply to anyone wanting to get married who can't, for which there's no valid reason to prevent them. You use arguments of things like 'it should be given by default unless shown there's a valid reason to NOT give it', or 'they love each other', but these are arguments that could apply in so many potential cases of various issues, the issue then becomes marriage as an institution and whether it is something to broaden or not in a more general sense. You're using an approach that is basically to just open marriage up. And then when that's pointed out to you, you just want to focus ONLY on gay marriage and cover your ears to any analogies or effects on other arrangements that could come up. Frankly, I see absolutely no reason we shouldn't consider the more wide-ranging implications of your arguments. We really can't and shouldn't approach gay marriage as an island of an issue, especially when the arguments you're putting forth wouldn't just apply to gay marriage. If this is truly just about MARRIAGE, then MARRIAGE (and ALL the implications with other things out there) has to be taken into consideration. That's why all these analogies are pertinent. You can't just automatically fling any analogy or related issue off the table when it happens to pertain to gay marriage just 'cause you don't want to hear about them and consider them. You don't get to limit the conversation to the implications of marriage to only gays and then use broader conversation (marriage as opposed to gay marriage) when it's convenient to you.\n \n \nIf the church is anti-gay I don't see how it matters how much time or focus they put into it.\n\n \n Good, I'm glad you agree with me! You finally found SOMETHING in agreement. It's not an issue of amount-of-time (a form of degree), as I've said to Foundit.",

   "This seems to be the only way you want to deal with analogies: you just assert over and over that you don't want to talk about that. It's in fact you with your hands over your ears, and you just refuse to even consider any analogy or similar issue and learn from that; you've started with your conclusion and won't even listen to anyone trying to get you to see what makes some tick who disagree with you on this. Frankly, your stubbornness on that is more like a religious fundie, who won't even listen or consider what anyone else is saying even from the standpoint of tolerance and trying to learn why some other people feel the way they feel. Of course analogies are 'different issues'; they are supposed to be. They are different issues used to show us something about the particular issue being discussed.\n\n \n THE POINT IS YOUR ANALOGIES ARE FAULTY OR FALSE ANALOGIES. The differences have been pointed out between gay marriage, and everything besides including the kitchen sink. Given the fact that the analogies are false, as has been proven over and over again, I don't see why we shouldn't discuss the issue at hand. But of course, you merely want a diversion. Every argument your side has is a violation of logic. \n \n \nThere is certainly another reason used by some to oppose gay rights, and I've already told you what it is: religious belief and therefore not accepting the idea of validating what some doctrinally believe is inappropriate behavior. Look, you can keep your head in the sand all you want, but it's not going to change the fact that for some religious belief really is the reason behind it. THAT'S why it's important to determine motivation--it at least a.) helps you deal with what's at the heart of opposition, and b.) learn to be more tolerant of things you disagree with.\n\n \n To state something is a \"belief\" isn't a good enough reason. Beliefs can be hateful, when they divide us from our shared humanity. It can set up categories or classes of people who are either the \"blessed or chosen\", and the \"unblessed or damned\". To say God frowns upon people being gay, is to put gay people in a different, lower class than the heterosexuals, when it comes to an important part of who we are. \n \n \nNo, you of all people (who oppose people telling you how to live your life) should understand the concept of not telling others what their personal morals should be.\n\n \n It's not absolute. None of us are an island. When I see an injustice, I will state that I am opposed to it.\n \n \nSorry, but there quite simply isn't anything special about gay marriage over any other form of marriage out there that people might want.\n\n \n Dear, there are many differences. The fact that a grapefruit is red, means it only shares one thing in common, with everything else in the world that is red, and it indeed has many differences.\n \n \nWhy do you think your form of marriage is special over any other person out there that may want marriage for whatever reason?\n\n \n You keep putting out this strawman. I'm not arguing for any old form of marriage, and I shouldn't have to argue against those things either. Fallacy, fallacy.\n \n \nFine; it may indeed do 'harm', but then so may ANY case of not broadening marriage to include some given group. I don't see why your case should be any more special than any other.\n\n \n And you restate the same strawman. This isn't my dilemma, as I'm not arguing for child-rape marriages.\n \n \nSo we should just broaden marriage to include anyone and any possible arrangement that ever comes along? No limits on it? Because this idea of yours that anything goes be default unless proven it shouldn't is pretty much wide-open, you know.\n\n \n Strawman, false dilemma. I said limits can be set, if these are ARGUED LOGICALLY. This is something you and your ilk are clearly unable to do, when it comes to equal marriage for same-sex couples.\n \n \nIn point of fact, they DID have to prove it. That's why both of these examples were handled via legislation, (the 19th amendment for women's voting and the 15th Amendment / Voting Rights Act of 1965 for African Americans) rather than taking a wide-open-already approach. But even THEN, voting has FAR more constitutional basis than marriage, which is never specified by the constitution at all, whereas voting IS.\n\n \n There was first a basic belief that all people are equal. \n \n \n\"All I've got?\" It's all I need when you use illegality to defend something. If we went by your reasoning that illegality should be all that's needed to not consider change, then you'd never have gotten ANY gay rights of any kind. To argue illegality is a specious argument on your part to begin with.\n\n \n It's one way to point out the differences. In areas where being gay is still illegal, obviously no one can argue for marriage.\n \n \nAnd so you're flat out wrong. No, my morality is certainly not to hate you at all. I don't hate you. I also reject this absurd and irrational idea that disagreeing on the view of gay marriage = hate. You really need to get past that.\n\n \n You're kidding yourself. You don't treat people differently when you accept and love them for who they are. You don't bring up issues of child rape, because you respect gay people an our human rights. \n \n \nSure. I thought we already were. This is ALL a part of that discussion.\n\n \n You don't want to discuss gay rights.\n \n \nThe difference, IMO, is because of what I think marriage is. IMO you can't separate the idea of marriage from to concept of opposite-sex--it's a fundamental aspect of what marriage is. To bring in other things and arrangements is to broaden it past what is a fundamental aspect of it. It's not the ONLY aspect of it, of course.\n\n \n Yes, we want it to include gay people. That's the change we want to see. It's not about \"other things\". It's about one thing specifically. It's that thing you don't like to talk about. Are you one of those who has problems even saying the word, \"gay\", I wonder. \n \n \nOn the other hand, I agree with you that you should be given equal rights constitutionally. (Gee, I'm SUCH a gay-hater thinking that, huh? emoticon_rolleyes) But what that entails is really the benefits that marriage happens to provide opposite-sex couples. They're ultimately just legality-based benefits as far as the government is concerned, so that's why I agree with the concept of giving gays civil unions. The bottom line is equality in terms of legality-based benefits. No reason to redefine marriage when that can be done a different way.\n\n \n No, it's not just about benefits, it's about recognition. Courts which have approved same-sex marriage, in North America, have found this to be true. If it's just a word, why is your side putting up such a fuss over it? Just let us have the word, and there will be one, simple thing for us all. You don't want us to have equal recognition, because that might legitimize who we are as equal to you. There is no national civil union, so how to go about getting this in each state, and develop some overall, standard across the nation? What a headache, when it would be easier to give gay people marriage. \n \n \nCome on, get real. I really don't think there's much difference in maturity between a 17yr+11mo. old kid and an 18 year old kid.\n\n \n Dear, you get real. This contrived fantasy about two high-school sweethearts having to wait a year to be married, is not the same thing. I showed you a real example in that documentary trailer. Real adult people who build a home and a life together over many years, and not being recognized, not being able to protect one another for the future. Do you not get it? Apparently not. You want to trivialize our relationships, like it's only some after-school TV special! You should be ashamed of yourself. \n \n \nThe point is that your approach to just broaden marriage would have to apply to anyone wanting to get married who can't, for which there's no valid reason to prevent them. You use arguments of things like 'it should be given by default unless shown there's a valid reason to NOT give it', or 'they love each other', but these are arguments that could apply in so many potential cases of various issues, the issue then becomes marriage as an institution and whether it is something to broaden or not in a more general sense.

You don't get to limit the conversation to the implications of marriage to only gays and then use broader conversation (marriage as opposed to gay marriage) when it's convenient to you.\n\n \n Garbage. The same cheap diversions, false dilemmas, strawmen, false analogies. I guess you don't want to talk about the issue of gay marriage, when the discussion is gay marriage. Why can't we change the definition of marriage to include gays? Indeed, we could use many of the same arguments to say heterosexual couples or Christian couples should have the right to marry. It doesn't mean we have to give it to everyone out there. If the ony argument against it is a diversion fallacy, a false analogy, a strawman, or a false dilemma, we don't have an argument, and straight and Christian marriages should be allowed. It's the same idea for gay marriages.\n \n I will certainly agree with you that the issue is marriage. I never said it wasn't. Your so-called broadest implications, are just whatever hogwash fantasies you can come up with to muddy the waters. I'm surprised you haven't talked about people marrying their pets or their toasters yet. Maybe you are saving all the big fun for later. In arguing for gay marriage, we argue for gay marriage.",

You obviously think gay marriage is above analogy--that it's special somehow to where it can't be compared to anything. Anything I bring up as analogy or comparison you rejct automatically, so it seems you don't really want to discuss gay marriage at all. It's absolutely silly to have the precondition here that no one can compare gay marriage to anything.\n \n \nTo state something is a \"belief\" isn't a good enough reason.

It can be for whatever reason anyone wants. I'm sorry, but no one has to get your approval for their views. Their morality doesn't have to pass your test, whatever that is. You aren't the morality police. Get over yourself! And I never said beliefs can't be hateful. Whether it's hateful or not, people are free to have their morals. You don't get to tell people how to believe, any more than they get to tell you how to live YOUR life. You don't agree with their morality (though you even mischaracterize it here-probably intentionally--trying to portray it as a class thing rather than doctrinal), but that's fine. You can hold to whatever morality you want, and they can as well.\n \n \nThere was first a basic belief that all people are equal.\n \n \n a.) \"Equal\"? Hogwash. Show me where it was a first basic belief that women and African Americans were considered equal. Better yet, show me where it was a first belief that 17 year olds are equal to 18 year olds in terms of marriage. Obviously they weren't, since the system wasn't set up to where all people were equal. If what you say were the case, we would never have needed legislation making various groups 'equal' with everyone else on various issues.\n \n b.) what constitutes practical and point-of-focus equality has changed over the years. The issue isn't that everyone is equal--you could make that statement about anything, over any issue. (Yeah, yeah, I know, you don't want any comparisons to anything. But this is a discussion and you're just going to have to deal with the concept of comparison.) The issue is whether or not GAY marriage is pertinent and important enough to give special enough status--over other issues--to bring it to some forefront and broaden marriage to bring in another group. But you don't want the general concept of equality at all--if you did you'd be fighting for ALL groups to be allowed into this marriage thing.\n \n \nNo, it's not just about benefits, it's about recognition.

The issue of getting 'standards' isn't an argument--you'd do civil unions the same way marriage is done state-by-state. It's not like gay marriage is a standard across all states either, so obviously gay marriage has no more of a tendency toward 'standards' than civil unions. Civil unions are certainly no more of a 'head ache' than trying to get a sea change done all over the country culturally and legally calling gay unions \"marriage.\"\n \n Second, this \"Recognition\" thing is bunk. Civil unions ARE a form of recognition, but I find it really odd that anyone would put such stock in whether the government calls a union, no matter WHAT it calls it--the \"M\" word or anything else. Who gives a hoot what the government calls it? Seriously, do you really think there's something magical about that? It's the government, for crying out loud. It's like making a big deal about whether the government calls people who can't walk \"handicapped\" as opposed to some other term. Who cares??? What matters is the disability benefits. As a married person, I could care less if the GOVERNMENT calls my union a \"marriage\" or not. It wouldn't be worth the trouble to me to fight to change it if YOUR sort of union were called \"Marriage\" from the government's standpoint and NOT mine. What would matter is to make sure I got the benefits--I could care less if they call it 'marriage', 'civil unions', 'goolash', or whatever. What matters to me is the benefits given for the union, and I'm all for you getting those benefits. But frankly, I could care less whether the GOVERNMENT \"recognizes\" anything as the \"M\" word or not. That's just semantics. It doesn't really mean anything. What matters is what YOU consider it.

Show me where it was a first basic belief that women and African Americans were considered equal.\n\n \n You don't think the root of this is the belief that \"all men are created equal\", as goes the famous line?

But you don't want the general concept of equality at all--if you did you'd be fighting for ALL groups to be allowed into this marriage thing.\n\n \n Naturally how and to whom the meaning of equality is applied has changed over the years. Society isn't static, and the law IS A LIVING TREE. This is especially true for the common law definition of marriage, which both Canada and the U.S. use. It may change. The term equality may be vague, but in this way it can respond to emerging groups of people in society, and their changing \"places\" for lack of a better word. It's true that anyone may take up, use the word \"equality\". Whether or not it will be applied in each area, is the debate, and that debate happens on a case by case basis. You keep pushing this false dilemma fallacy. In the case of gay equality, we can give this to gays, without having to give it to everyone. Our choices are not limited to merely two: either reject gay equality, or else accept child rapist equality(or insert whatever red herring). \n \n \n??? First, Marriage is a state-level issue. The issue of getting 'standards' isn't an argument--you'd do civil unions the same way marriage is done state-by-state. It's not like gay marriage is a standard across all states either, so obviously gay marriage has no more of a tendency toward 'standards' than civil unions. Civil unions are certainly no more of a 'head ache' than trying to get a sea change done all over the country culturally and legally calling gay unions \"marriage.\"\n\n \n But separate but equal is never truly equal. Also, marriages that involve couples of the same sex, would simply be marriages. These would have the same rights as marriages of people of different sex. There would be one harmonious institution.\n \n \nSecond, this \"Recognition\" thing is bunk. Civil unions ARE a form of recognition,\n\n \n It's a separate but equal recognition. It's like separate water fountains. The whole concept has been rejected long ago by the courts.\n \n \nbut I find it really odd that anyone would put such stock in whether the government calls a union, no matter WHAT it calls it--the \"M\" word or anything else.

Geez, it's not like I say \"I do\" just to make sure the government calls it the \"M\" word.\n\n \n If it doesn't mean anything, just let us have it! Duh. It does mean something, or else you wouldn't bother arguing against us having what you have! I'm not buying this business that you'd give it up, because it means nothing to you, but you don't think it's just as crazy for others to care whether or not we have it!!! You ought to be equally critical of the anti-gay marriage people if such is the case! Why should they and you care if it means nothing?! This is just more transparent, disingenuous trickery from your side.\n \n \nWell, I don't think I can help you on this one if you think mere disagreement on whether you should get benefits via civil unions as opposed to redefining marriage (all the while agreeing with you on every other gay rights-related issue) is HATE. Do you just go around assuming most everyone in the world hates you? I can't imagine living with such a view toward normal, everyday people who don't have anything against you. Talk about a martyr complex ...\n\n \n We don't exclude for no logical reason, those we like.\n \n \nSure I get it. It's why I am supportive of you getting couples' benefits. I've already told you I support that. Why would I be ashamed of myself for believing you should have benefits for being a couple? You have an odd way of thinking, to think people should be ashamed of something like that.\n\n \n Having one institution of marriage, equal for gays and straights is the best way to ensure the benefits, and the equal recognition. The laws are not only about dollars and cents. It is insulting, the highschool sweethearts having to wait a year or less example. They could have it all in a short time, but gay people at any age, still won't have what they have, if we don't have marriage, even if we are together for a very long time.\n \n \nMy view is that we shouldn't because I see no reason it's any more of an arbitrary change than many other things. I think if you're going to open marriage up, you have to do it for anyone who comes along if you use the 'equality' argument.\n\n \n Well your \"reason\" is a false dilemma fallacy, as has already been stated. Whether or not we use the term \"equality\", or some other general concept in another situation, our choices are not usually limited to only two. This false dilemma is not the reality with gay marriage. We've had it in places for many years, without everything else and the kitchen sink.\n \n How is it that you can can argue for equal benefits for gay couples, without having to do so for everything and everything? The same way I can argue for equal marriage for same-sex couples.",

   "Well, you want to compare it to ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. I'd say it has more in common with straight marriage. \n\n \n Why don't you just admit that you just don't want to consider any comparison that isn't sympathetic to your position on this? That's the bottom line. It's not that the analogies are wrong (though you've shown you're going to whine over them to the bitter end), it's that you're intent on flinging any comparison off the table that doesn't support gay marriage. You're deciding on the comparisons based solely on your dogmatic position rather than letting the comparisons be taken under consideration for your position. In essence, you're being closed minded about it.\n \n Now, regarding your analogy of straight marriage, the problem is that gays are such a small minority, they are really no larger than any other given group that might want marriage. The usual adage is that gays are everywhere--guess what: when you're less than 5% of the population (which is what most estimates tend to hold to), that's not going to be \"everywhere.\" Now you can make the argument that percentage is irrelevant and that we shouldn't base equality on that, but then you've opened up the problem of any other group that might want marriage no matter how small. It's just fraught with problems. Better to leave marriage to straight people as it is, rather than redefining it for every little minority group that comes along.\n \n There, you see? I addressed your comparison (straight marriage) rather than crying foul and howling about it. You really can discuss comparisons--they are part of the overall discussion.\n \n \n Lol, I am part of a larger whole that is questioning these beliefs. It's how society moves forward, and addresses its mistakes of the past, and the injustices. You are living in a changing society. This isn't just about me. Challenge and question accepted beliefs, and ones that will become less accepted with that questioning. \n\n \n It doesn't matter--no one is saying you can't \"question\" these beliefs--you can hold to whatever beliefs or not, that you want to. What I'm saying is that you should know that you shouldn't tell others what their morality should be when you yourself don't want others to tell you how to live your life. If you don't want people to tell you how to live your life, then don't turn right around and tell others how to live theirs. Doing so on your part is not \"questioning\"; it's being a hypocrite, frankly.\n \n \n I don't care where the homophobia comes from, it's wrong. I picture some grumpy old man in a rocking chair going on about how racism, sexism or homophobia is his belief and he has a right to it, darn it! He knows it can't stand up to questioning, and can't deal with the fact that the world is changing around him in ways he doesn't understand.\n\n \n Well that tells me for certain you are going off your stereotypes rather that reality. Many people who don't agree with you on gay-related issues aren't like that--they are just trying to abide by their religious beliefs. It's sort of like the way Amish people don't use electrical devices or cars. There's nothing rational about that. There's no \"logical\" reason for not using electricity. That doesn't matter!! What matters is simply that it's their choice to live that way, and it's not really your place to tell them how to live their lives. Ultimately, it doesn't matter what you think of their beliefs. It's really their business that they want to stay the same in an area others in the world are changing on. (It's not like an issue is right or wrong based on change anyway.) You aren't their nanny, and don't get to determine what their beliefs should be. You're going to have to get used to the fact that religion doesn't always allow homosexual relationships in its doctrine. You might as well be demanding the Amish go out and buy cadillacs and sell their carriages. \n \n \nThe term equality may be vague, but in this way it can respond to emerging groups of people in society, and their changing \"places\" for lack of a better word. It's true that anyone may take up, use the word \"equality\". Whether or not it will be applied in each area, is the debate, and that debate happens on a case by case basis.\n\n \n No--you quite simply don't want to consider the issue of precedent. And when you're using arguments about GENERAL equality to argue for a very specific sort of 'equality', you open up many broader issues. There's no way around that. Let me give you an analogy to help you see what I mean ..... (And there's NO way this can be 'offensive', so don't just cop-out and try to avoid it) If someone is arguing that everyone should buy a Toyota Prius by using a very general argument that says people should get better MPG, they use an argument that naturally is going to open up the issue of OTHER vehicles that may get good MPG too. See, if you're only going to argue for ONE SPECIFIC group to be 'equal' with another, then using arguments that--by their own nature--deal far more broadly opens up a world of other issues. You're using broader arguments about  marriage to argue for a specific type of marriage. And frankly, it's absurd to deal with one kind of marriage in a vacuum. Why should I not consider the Honda Civic if your argument for the Prius'es is nothing more than a demand for better MPG? It does just as good, you know. Gay marriage as an issue touches on marriage and 'equality', by your admission. Quite simply, there is no way to honestly address and discuss gay marriage without other marriage issues coming up, because it brings up all sort of points about marriage in general. If you're going to discuss MARRIAGE, then you have to deal with, well ... marriage. Not just gay marriage. It's like trying to discuss whether or not Christianity has problems while trying to avoid daring talk about religion as a general concept in any way. Your demand on the discussion is absurd.\n \n \nIn the case of gay equality, we can give this to gays, without having to give it to everyone. \n\n \n But why would you want to NOT give it to everyone, if you are really and truly for equality??? THAT'S the point. Your claim to be for equality is a FARCE when you make statements like you just did. And do you reall think it goes unnoticed that you've now changed your terminology from just \"equality\" to \"gay equality\"? How is only putting ONE group in there an example of real equality? \n \n \nBut separate but equal is never truly equal. Also, marriages that involve couples of the same sex, would simply be marriages. These would have the same rights as marriages of people different sex. There would be one harmonious institution.\n\n \n So just an institution with two groups, eh? You know, have you thought about the fact that, if the Civil Rights Act took your approach to \"equality\", the only groups that would have protections would be white people and black people? It's like taking the race issue, and ONLY expanding the law to cover ONE OTHER RACE. That's the problem I have with your approach here. You insist on each issue being dealt with on it's own (really because you just don't want to have to deal with any comparisons that require you to argue against them), but if you're truly for making marriage FAIR, that's not good enough! The issue is really about whether marriage is going to be opened or not to anyone. That's the 900 lb elephant here--the debate is really about MARRIAGE, not just gay marriage.\n \n \nIf it doesn't mean anything, just let us have it! Duh. It does mean something, or else you wouldn't bother arguing against us having what you have!\n\n \n It's not worth the trouble--bottom line. You're saying we should cease having the government recognize straight unions and marriage, and start doing so for gay unions. The amount of beurocratic change that would require makes it absurd; not to mention the cultural change it would entail. And frankly, that's one big reason I see no point in doing anything beyond civil unions as the vehicle for couples' benefits for gays: it's just not worth the trouble to bother with, frankly. It would be different if the government's use of the \"M\" word really WERE the magical pixie dust that you obviously think it is, but it's just not, and therefore it's a waste of time and effort. What matters is the couples' benefits. If you have them, you AREN'T separate. You're the same. The couples' benefits ARE the government's side of it.\n \n \nThis is just more transparent, disingenuous trickery from your side.\n\n \n Yeah, that's it .... it's all just an attempt to trick you. emoticon_rolleyes Whenever anyone discusses gay marriage, they're just trying to trick you up. Hey, watch yourself--everyday is April Fool's you know. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nIt is insulting, the highschool sweethearts having to wait a year or less example. They could have it all in a short time, but gay people at any age, still won't have what they have, if we don't have marriage, even if we are together for a very long time.\n\n \n Well at least you're actually doing a little addressing of the comparison now. But there's never any guarantee a young couple will be able to marry, and frankly, withholding their rights just because \"they can wait\" isn't real equality you know; equality shouldn't be contingent on having to wait. That's like saying gays can have marriage IF they only wait until they turn 40. Would you accept that? Probably not. Bottom line: marriage is never an equality-based institution. It was never really meant to be. If it were, there wouldn't be such limits as \"2 people\" or arbitrarily assigning the age minimum to 18 in many states (when many 17 year olds may be mature enough to marry).",

   "Why don't you just admit that you just don't want to consider any comparison that isn't sympathetic to your position on this? That's the bottom line. It's not that the analogies are wrong (though you've shown you're going to whine over them to the bitter end), it's that you're intent on flinging any comparison off the table that doesn't support gay marriage. You're deciding on the comparisons based solely on your dogmatic position rather than letting the comparisons be taken under consideration for your position. In essence, you're being closed minded about it.\n\n \n No. The major differences have been addressed, when it comes to your analogies. The comparison to straight marriage, is a good one, because the only difference is the sex of the partners. You insist on using these false analogies, even after the differences are pointed out to you, and you do so over and over again, because the tactic is to associate our issues of marriage equality with extreme hot button topics such as child rape, or else to go off on some ridiculous diversion about high school sweethearts. Since we can't definately decide on their maturity at any given age, we can't decide on gay marriage. Bull. \n \n \nNow, regarding your analogy of straight marriage, the problem is that gays are such a small minority,\n\n \n Stop right there.

The only kind of comparison that would demonstrate the sort of controversy and moral delimma it creates for many people is to use another issue that creates a moral delimma. Sorry, but those comparisons will continue because they are the only ones that demonstrate that aspect of it.\n \n By the way, pointing out the arbitrariness of 18 versus 17 in terms of age to BE MARRIED is not offensive. It's not \"child rape\"--I've not said anything about that--you're the one who's brought that thinking to the table here in regards to these comparisons. A number of states DO have their minimum age to get married lower than 18--are you saying those states support rape? If you're offended by daring bring up minimum age to marry, you're waaay too easily offended here.\n \n \nStop right there. That is saying the minority status of gays ourselves, is a problem that should prevent us from entering marriage. Many other minorities are being married.\n\n \n The question is, why should we change marriage to let you--one minority--fall under it's auspices, when others could meet the same sort of criteria you put forward in arguing for it? \n \n \nSo you are saying there can be no moral stands, ever, unless we allow for bad ones?\n\n \n You're the one saying you aren't tolerant of other moral stands here, not me. I'm fully aware there are good ones and bad ones. I'm just not going to do what you do and tell people what their morals should be. I have no interest in being the thought police as you do.\n \n \nThe Amish are not setting aside members of their community, and discriminating against them, based on an important part of their human character, which is innate.\n\n \n Sure they are! When their religion dictates they can't use electricty or automobiles, they ARE setting people aside to disscriminate against them. That's pretty cut and dry. Whether or not it's because of something \"innate\" is completely irrelevant. It's STILL discrimination that doesn't meet your arguments that there has to be a LOGICAL reason for it.\n \n (Incidentally, I love how gay rights proponents often use these vague terms like \"Logical\" and \"reasonable\" and compelling\" in putting out what evidence needs to be. As if those terms are specific and non-subjective in any way. Rarely do I see anyone actually qualify those terms, obviously because if they do they will no longer have the option of arbitrarily taking any argument they don't like and just saying it's not \"logical\", \"reasonable\", or \"compelling.\")\n \n \nYou are wrong. That's not what's happening. Equality is a broad issue, I'm not denying that. But you are hinting we deny rights, based on a crystal ball prediction of who may or may not take up that cause in the unforseeable future.

After all, we can't really discuss gay marriage without discussing marriage in a more general sense. Again, it's like trying to discuss Hinduism without mentioning religion more generally. \n \n \nHow about expanding the laws to cover non-discrimination and equality based on race, sex, and sexual orientation? You're stretching to more bizarre lengths, further on. I feel sorry for you.\n\n \n Interesting that you've now starting throwing little personal comments in to condescend, like \"you're losing it\", and \"I feel sorry for you\", and \" You're starting to frighten me\". Is this what you do when you start to realize the problems in your arguments? Is this your way of dealing with that?\n \n I already told you I'm all for you having the protections of the law in terms of gay rights. The only area I have any real disagreement on any of that is giving couples' benefits via civil unions, which would be the approach I'd prefer. Heck, even Foundit has indicated here that acknowledges that on my part.

Sorry, but those comparisons will continue because they are the only ones that demonstrate that aspect of it.\n\n \n Please. There are many differences. I believe you want to associate it with something horrible, because gay marriage is no longer deemed so horrible by itself. That's what it's a sign of. These desperate, fallacious, comparisons always come out as the change is happening in society.\n \n \nBy the way, pointing out the arbitrariness of 18 versus 17 in terms of age to BE MARRIED is not offensive. It's not \"child rape\"--I've not said anything about that--you're the one who's brought that thinking to the table here in regards to these comparisons. A number of states DO have their minimum age to get married lower than 18--are you saying those states support rape? If you're offended by daring bring up minimum age to marry, you're waaay too easily offended here.\n\n \n It's really strange. I've only heard this comparison made by Americans in debate. There is more than an arbitrary reasoning. The line must be drawn somewhere. Although no law is perfect, and we can debate finer points such as close in age exemptions for \"puppy love\". IT DOES protect a lot of people below the age who are not mature.\n \n \nThe question is, why should we change marriage to let you--one minority--fall under it's auspices, when others could meet the same sort of criteria you put forward in arguing for it?\n\n \n No, the fact is, when you put the argument in those terms, it's a false dilemma logical fallacy. Also, we have much more in common with heterosexual couples, despite the fact that we do belong to a minority as well.\n \n \nYou're the one saying you aren't tolerant of other moral stands here, not me. I'm fully aware there are good ones and bad ones. I'm just not going to do what you do and tell people what their morals should be. I have no interest in being the thought police as you do.\n\n \n That's your perogative. It's also mine to not accept exclusion.\n \n \nSure they are! When their religion dictates they can't use electricty or automobiles, they ARE setting people aside to disscriminate against them. That's pretty cut and dry. Whether or not it's because of something \"innate\" is completely irrelevant. It's STILL discrimination that doesn't meet your arguments that there has to be a LOGICAL reason for it.\n\n \n I don't believe the fact that it's an important innate trait is irrelevent. We then have to look at the social effects, which are different, even though both would technically be discrimination. We should take into account the social effects when developing a moral code.\n \n \n(Incidentally, I love how gay rights proponents often use these vague terms like \"Logical\" and \"reasonable\" and compelling\" in putting out what evidence needs to be. As if those terms are specific and non-subjective in any way. Rarely do I see anyone actually qualify those terms, obviously because if they do they will no longer have the option of arbitrarily taking any argument they don't like and just saying it's not \"logical\", \"reasonable\", or \"compelling.\")\n\n \n Well, our stand is much more qualified than your \"moral issue\", and \"belief\" and \"doctrine\" bits. Also, logical fallacies are not qualifiers for discrimination in a just, and rational society. \n \n \nNo, I'm saying marriage either needs to be opened up or not. When you open the pandora's box of whether or not marriage is equal, you open it up for far more than just gays.\n\n \n That's a slippery slope fallacy.\n \n \nSorry if you're having trouble keeping up! :) \n\n \n Not at all. I've got your number. \n \n \nI don't care if you use the term equality or not, but if you do keep using a general term, I'm going to assume you mean equality in a general sense unless you qualify it, and therefore call you on it. After all, we can't really discuss gay marriage without discussing marriage in a more general sense.\n\n \n So everytime I use the word equality, even considering it's in the context of equal rights for gays, I must spell it out perfectly each and every time, \"equal rights for gays\", \"equal rights for gays\", \"equal rights for gays\"? Give me a break! I can't help it if some people are so silly, or purposely pretending to not know what I mean in order to misrepresent my argument.\n \n \nAgain, it's like trying to discuss Hinduism without mentioning religion more generally.\n\n \n No, it's like discussing Hinduism, but talking about every religion excpet Hinduism, and trying to lump them all in together, not taking into account all the differences. Again, I am not saying gay marriage is not about marriage. STRANGE!!! \n \n \nInteresting that you've now starting throwing little personal comments in to condescend, like \"you're losing it\", and \"I feel sorry for you\", and \" You're starting to frighten me\". Is this what you do when you start to realize the problems in your arguments? Is this your way of dealing with that?\n\n \n No, I am just getting annoyed. Perhaps I should take the higher road. I'm not perfect. It's your arguments which have the problems, which I point out ad nauseum, and then you just keep on.\n \n \nI already told you I'm all for you having the protections of the law in terms of gay rights. The only area I have any real disagreement on any of that is giving couples' benefits via civil unions, which would be the approach I'd prefer. Heck, even Foundit has indicated here that acknowledges that on my part. But you just continue to blindly lash out calling me a 'gay hater' when I've come out saying I agree with you on so many of these issues. Again, you must think an awful lot of people hate you when they really don't.\n\n \n I think exclusion, for no reason, would indicate hate. You want me to lower my expectations and accept something, because I could have nothing. But I want to be right up there in the front of the line with you, having what you have. Since you said you believe in the slippery slope fallacy, why wouldn't giving equal benefits cause a slippery slope? This involves a general principle of equality being extended to gays too.\n \n \nWell, ok. (shrug) That's up to you whether or not you \"buy\" it or not--I don't really care. It's my view and I'm not going to beg you to simply say 'ok.' Belligerence on your part doesn't refute anything.\n\n \n I know you don't care, except when it comes to supporting the exclusion of gay people for irrational reasons. \n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nYep, everybody's all out to get you. All dishonest and trying to ruin your life. LOL. That's it, Jake! emoticon_xgood\n\n \n Well the arguments from your side make no sense. So, either you are silly, or you just don't want us to have what you have and will purposely use these fallacies to try to con people, betting that you can appeal to the lowest denominator of the witless masses.",

The fact that you can find some similarities, does not mean it's exactly the same thing. Such similarities exist with different sex marriages, and other currently legal marriage types, such as love, no logical reason to deny. As I've said many times already, there are more similarities when it comes to gay marriage, to all other legal marriages.

So why should we draw it just a little farther out for you?\n\n \n In terms of age of consent we decided based on the issue at hand. Now, let's do the same for equal marriage for gay couples. We love, we are a legal part of communities and have been integrated in every other way in society. This is the only way we can marry someone of our choice, whom we love, due to our innate hard-wiring.

I'm sorry, but everyone here knows I meant equality in terms of gay rights, on a gay rights board. And I was talking about equal in terms of equal marriage for same-sex couples on such a board, in such a context, on such a topic. \n \n \nWell then you're wrong.

It's so absurd to call support on most everything \"hate\", that I can think of no other reason you'd do that.\n\n \n It's unjustified exclusion though. It's not suddenly not this, because it is doctrine, or because it is only applied to the institution of marriage. Why are we not acceptable to be there with you in this important cultural institution because we're gay(unless we act straight)? We won't pollute it. We won't bring anything else with us, and you know that. But the all-powerful maker has blessed you for this, not us, according to some religious beliefs. Why not? Are we not all human? Exclusion of gays, in any context, is based on hate. The diversions are an attempt to not have to deal with us and our issues, based on that bigotry or hate or prejudice or fear. I asked you more than once now(although first time was a late edit you may not have seen), how you can have equality on one level for gays, in terms of benefits, but not extend that to everything else. There was no answer. You know why: false dilemmas or slippery slopes are fallacious nonsense. \n \n \nIt makes no sense to YOU, as you aren't of those religious beliefs.\n\n \n So the situation suddenly changes from being what it is, if you invoke religion? I don't think so.\n \n \nJust as it makes no sense for Amish people to not use electricity. But it makes perfect sense to them, and that's what matters.\n\n \n Yes, but there are different circumstances when it comes to being gay, which do centre on the innateness of an important human trait of one's fundamental sexuality. The effects of such exclusion are different. That's what you simply brush aside.\n \n \nThe fact is, religion doesn't have to prove anything to you in regards to their doctrine. Their personal morals don't need YOUR approval.\n \n The Amish don't have to run it by you everytime they want to take a horse-drawn carriage instead of a Cadillac. Not everyone has to subscribe to your morality, Jake.\n\n \n Well you just keep going by this. Anyone can have an opinion, and hold that no matter what. Your pont here is a cicular fallacy.

What is offensive is that you seem to have a superiority complex over your morality. There's a certain inherent arrogance in your approach here in that you make a value judgment on the MORALITY of others and tell them how they should think, which goes beyond debating rights issues, even to the point of just trying to label what you don't agree with as \"hateful\". I'm not out to tell you how to THINK; but you obviously ARE out to tell me how to think. I'm not one to think you are evil for your morals at all, but you are one (obviously) to think others are evil for THEIR morals, even when their morals are just personal ones. Again though, I suspect that's just a propaganda effort on your part, though it's certainly a disingenuous one.\n \n \nMarriage is a right.

Why are we not acceptable to be there with you in this important cultural institution because we're gay(unless we act straight)? We won't pollute it.\n\n \n That has nothing to do with it. It's a religious doctrinal thing. It won't pollute the Amish to start using electric appliances either, but their doctrinal views is that they don't want to use them. It's not a HATE against people that use electricity that drives that belief. But your logic would be that it is. It's silly on your part to assume that, frankly. Again, likely it's a tactic on your part, because I know you're smart enough to know that religious belief can exist without being nothing more than a hateful value judgment. But as long as you put forth the deception that it can't, I'll call you on it.\n \n \nWhy not? Are we not all human? Exclusion of gays, in any context, is based on hate.\n\n \n Yeah, those evil pork-eaters are just not human are they? It's only because they hate pork-eating people that Jewish people don't believe it's moral to eat pork, huh? emoticon_rolleyes It's always just HATE. See, no one is saying some religious people don't hate you. What is being taken issue with here is the idea it's ALWAYS hate, which is what you think. You're the one taking the all-or-nothing make-no-exceptions extreme stance here. And frankly, you're being too stubborn to even admit that. \n \n \nSo the situation suddenly changes from being what it is, if you invoke religion? I don't think so.\n\n \n If religion is what's behind it, it doesn't have to be 'invoked;' it's already there. The one doing the invoking in such cases is YOU, by invoking the concept of 'hate.' You might as well be saying religious teetotalers are falsely \"invoking\" religion rather than really genuinely holding to the religious doctrinal view that alcohol consumption is ALWAYS bad to even the smallest degree. Your logic is like saying they only hold to their view because they HATE any PERSON who drinks a sip of wine. Your take on this just doesn't add up to reality.\n \n \nYes, but there are different circumstances when it comes to being gay, which do centre on the innateness of an important human trait \n\n \n But the religious doctrinal belief has nothing to do with that.

Just because it happens to be called the \"M\" word for opposite-sex couples simply means that's what it's called--it's a term.\n\n \n Yes, but the term doesn't just involve the benefits. There certainly is a social recognition factor associated with the term. It does mean something greater, socially, culturally. If you wish to argue against that, you argue against marriage itself. We don't need it at all. We can just give benefits to everyone, gay or straight. There is no need for straight people to have marriage either. Ironically, this is what may happen, if we set up parallel systems, where gay and straight couples can get the benefits without entering into the institution of marriage. Marriage then stands to lose special meaning.\n \n \nAlso, what are \"intangible\" benefits? Examples please. If it's not even tangible, how can you even quantify or qualify it?

I don't really care if you're convinced to adopt my morality or not--I don't think anyone is out to convert you to any moralistic view.\n\n \n But they want it reflected in society. They want to decide I can't have what they have, based on their immoral views.\n \n \nWhat is offensive is that you seem to have a superiority complex over your morality.

Don't tell me your morals are only personal when you apply them BEYOND THE PERSONAL SITUATION, as I've just described. Yes, I do think it's evil to insult gay people's humanity, even when it doesn't take the form of legislation. I will openly disagree with it, and not give it an unwarranted respect.\n \n \nWhy should society just start applying that term for love in YOUR case when we don't in many others?\n\n \n Forget about other cases for one second. But you can't, because then you may have to let your prejudice go, and just see us for who we really are, without the distraction. I've told you why in my case. This is a fundamental part of us, the only way we can have sexual love. It's not a mere practice, like polygamy, but is part of \"deeper processes\" as a heterosexual said on another thread, when discussing swinging. It does not involve child rape, like some other things. The only difference with heterosexuality is a physical aspect of the partners involved.\n \n \nBut you said you agreed the issue is MARRIAGE, not just 'gay marriage.' Which is it going to be? So basically, you're saying you want the line for what constitutes marriage moved just a little to include one more group.\n\n \n Exactly. We can move the line on many issues, without moving it to encompass everything. We're not limited to two choices: either keep it exactly the same, or else change it to involve everything. It's not so starkly black or white. It's been done before on marriage.\n \n \nThat has nothing to do with it. It's a religious doctrinal thing. It won't pollute the Amish to start using electric appliances either, but their doctrinal views is that they don't want to use them. It's not a HATE against people that use electricity that drives that belief. But your logic would be that it is. It's silly on your part to assume that, frankly. Again, likely it's a tactic on your part, because I know you're smart enough to know that religious belief can exist without being nothing more than a hateful value judgment. But as long as you put forth the deception that it can't, I'll call you on it.\n \n \n \n Yeah, those evil pork-eaters are just not human are they? It's only because they hate pork-eating people that Jewish people don't believe it's moral to eat pork, huh? emoticon_rolleyes It's always just HATE. See, no one is saying some religious people don't hate you. What is being taken issue with here is the idea it's ALWAYS hate, which is what you think. You're the one taking the all-or-nothing make-no-exceptions extreme stance here. And frankly, you're being too stubborn to even admit that. \n \n \n \n If religion is what's behind it, it doesn't have to be 'invoked;' it's already there. The one doing the invoking in such cases is YOU, by invoking the concept of 'hate.' You might as well be saying religious teetotalers are falsely \"invoking\" religion rather than really genuinely holding to the religious doctrinal view that alcohol consumption is ALWAYS bad to even the smallest degree. Your logic is like saying they only hold to their view because they HATE any PERSON who drinks a sip of wine. Your take on this just doesn't add up to reality.\n \n \n \n But the religious doctrinal belief has nothing to do with that. It's a separate issue entirely from innateness.\n\n \n You don't even want to deal with the issue, you just want to distract yourself from it. There are real negative social effects when we tell gay children they can't grow up to have their relationships, how they express who they are as humans, deeply, fundamentally, innately; treated the same as the heterosexuals. Bigotry does not have to be loud and in one's face, it doesn't have to be violent. It can take subtle tones, but these still have a very negative effect, and lead to painful exclusion, even if the suffering is more silent and less obvious at any given point in time.\n \n To not want to deal with this, to continue on doing it, may not totally be a conscious thing. It's just \"how you were raised\". However, even if it is all these things: subtle, not fully conscious, it's still a bad way to treat your fellow human based on his or her difference. I'd say it's not even that big of a difference, and as gays become more accepted for who we are, people are seeing this.\n \n We've seen studies posted at this site, about the negative effects of gay social exclusion. This is not the same as choosing a practice or lifestyle such as having many wives, or not having electricity, or not eating pork. This involves those \"deeper processes\", like being straight.",

   "Not at all. I explained why it's more comparable to different sex marriages, the only difference is a physical thing, the anatomy. But the problem here is that your one and only argument against gay marriage is to stay off the topic of gay marriage, by discussing things that have more differences, and only those things.\n\n \n It's comparable to many things, standard marriage (opposite sex) included, and other things. Come on, you're being unreasonable here with this compare-to-nothing-else approach of yours. I'd say there's MUCH we could say about it and I really don't think admitting that one of those things is the religious doctrine at the root of some of the opposition is an unreasonable thing for you to agree with here. No need to just be stubborn about it.\n \n \nThe fact that it's a minority? Isn't that kind of flimsy?\n\n \n No, you've obviously missed the point of every analogy I've used. I don't need to show you you're in the minority; you already know that.\n \n \nThis is a strawman. I completely agree [that the issue is the broader issue of marriage]. No need to argue on that point. \n\n \n But then you DON'T want me to talk about marriage in a more general sense. On one hand you're saying you agree, then when I use comparisons to other aspects of marriage, you say you only want to talk about GAY marriage. You're speaking out both sides of your mouth here.\n \n \nYes, but the term doesn't just involve the benefits. There certainly is a social recognition factor associated with the term. It does mean something greater, socially, culturally. If you wish to argue against that, you argue against marriage itself. We don't need it at all. We can just give benefits to everyone, gay or straight. There is no need for straight people to have marriage either. Ironically, this is what may happen, if we set up parallel systems, where gay and straight couples can get the benefits without entering into the institution of marriage. Marriage then stands to lose special meaning.\n \n I'm talking about the social recognition and support, which is why straight people enter into marriage.\n\n \n Then you're talking about a SOCIAL thing. There are two different issues here: government benefits for couples and social \"recognition\" of gays (which you've already admitted is \"socially\" and \"culturally\" (not government). The term, from the government's standpoint, certainly DOES ONLY mean benefits. It makes no difference to me what you call it culturally. You are free to call your union anything you want, I don't care. That's nothing more than a symbolic gesture.\n \n \nBut they want it reflected in society. They want to decide I can't have what they have, based on their immoral views.\n\n \n Then you're now talking about legal benefits. I've already told you, I support you having couples' benefits. \n \n \nWhat's offensive is you get to decide on my life, that it won't be a married one, because of your bigotry. Don't tell me your morals are only personal when you apply them BEYOND THE PERSONAL SITUATION, as I've just described. Yes, I do think it's evil to insult gay people's humanity, even when it doesn't take the form of legislation. I will openly disagree with it, and not give it an unwarranted respect.\n\n \n They are only personal morals. That's what morals are. I can't make you hold to any given morality any more than you can make ME do so. Morals are always personal beliefs. Look, you're so overly sensitive on this issue it's practically impossible to have a conversation with you on it. No one here is saying you're not \"human\"--that's your propagandist rhetoric talking-points speaking. Sorry, but I don't care if you think it's 'evil'--you aren't the final word on what's evil or right and wrong, and you labeling objection as such doesn't make it so. (Though again, I think you're just using tactics here because you HAVE to know better.) YOU don't get to decide what's evil or not for everyone else, so I hope you'll get off the proverbial high horse here. No one here is HATING you. No one here thinks you \"aren't human\", or whatever else the mischaracterization-of-the-day is. You've been feeding yourself this garbage for so long now (or letting gay lobby groups feed you), that you've apparently convinced yourself everyone is out to get you and everyone hates you just because they happen to have religious doctrines about a given action. You've learned you can avoid having to question your views, assumptions, and stereotypes if you just paint them all in your mind as monsters, and so you're cop-ing out, huh? Get some reality, Jake, drop the martyr complex, and start thinking for yourself. What kind of mindset thinks that way? Do you just going around thinking most of the world hates you? Are you really that deluded, because I don't think you are, and I think you're engaging in ideological posturing here by portraying the situation as everyone being against you. You HAVE to be--your view that ANY religious objection = hate is just too far outside of reality. \n \n No one here denies some religious people hate gays. No one is trying to say here that gays don't 'suffer', or that they aren't sometimes 'hated', or that they don't need 'acceptance', or that they aren't sometimes 'discriminated' against, or whatever other else the talking point of the day is. No one is saying any of that is wrong, from what I see. I really doubt there's a person here that would not agree with any of that stuff. \n \n But maybe you really don't realize how out-of-touch and unrooted in reality this view of yours is that religious objection automatically = hate and thinking you aren't human, or whatever. People are multi-faceted, Jake. It's wrong to just characterize disagreement as hatred--that's the SAME sort of mentality that some engage in when they call Democrats unpatriotic just because they have OTHER views on what's best. Yep, same sort of thing. \n \n \nForget about other cases for one second. But you can't\n\n \n No, I indeed can't think of ANY type of marriage in a vacuum, with no regard to the broader issue of the institution. I think it would be absurd and naive to do so. No matter how 'innate' it really is, it doesn't change the religious doctrinal view. Principles wouldn't exactly be very solid if they're dependent entirely on whether or not something seems natural to someone, now would they?\n \n \nYou don't even want to deal with the issue, you just want to distract yourself from it. There are real negative social effects when we tell gay children they can't grow up to have their relationships\n\n \n Sure, no one's denying that. So people need to learn to object to things without demeaning them. That's certainly true. Religious belief should conduct it's objections without dehumanizing people. But I think if you're being honest here, you'd come right out and say what you really want is not so much for religion to stop dehumanizing, but for religion to be silent on this matter and give up all its principles on this. You just don't like it because it's an example of someone saying something YOU'RE doing is wrong, in their opinion. The whole thing about \"negative social effects\" is a canard--an excuse--you just don't want any objection from religion, period. You don't want religion to [i]be[i] religion, in this case.\n \n \nhow they express who they are as humans, deeply, fundamentally, innately; treated the same as the heterosexuals. \n\n \n Bah. Sexuality is not the be-all and end-all of things. Whether or not the government used the \"M\" word for my relationship with someone is certainly not \"fundamental\" to me, and I see no reason to pander to you just because something like that is fundamental to you. You conflate things like \"expression\" and \"deeply\" with things like the M word and governmental benefits. It makes no sense, really.",

   "It's comparable to many things, standard marriage (opposite sex) included, and other things. Come on, you're being unreasonable here with this compare-to-nothing-else approach of yours.\n\n \n Nope. When it comes to gay marriage, it's more logically comaparable, in more ways, to some things like straight couple marriage than to others, is what I'm saying. Only the genital make-up of the couples is different. \n \n \nI'd say there's MUCH we could say about it and I really don't think admitting that one of those things is the religious doctrine at the root of some of the opposition is an unreasonable thing for you to agree with here. No need to just be stubborn about it.\n\n \n I didn't say it wasn't religious doctrine. I just said that religious doctrine may be discriminatory, exclusionary and hateful. It can have an awful or unjustifiably negative effect in reality.\n \n \nNo, you've obviously missed the point of every analogy I've used. I don't need to show you you're in the minority; you already know that.\n\n \n Indeed, I know that. I don't see any other similarities to the things you mention. Other than your homosexuality \"once was\" treated this way or that way. Which is irrelevent to now.\n \n \nBut then you DON'T want me to talk about marriage in a more general sense. On one hand you're saying you agree, then when I use comparisons to other aspects of marriage, you say you only want to talk about GAY marriage. You're speaking out both sides of your mouth here.\n\n \n No, marriage is marriage. But polygamy, age of consent issues, are not necessarily at the root of its meaning. If they are, then you could obviously just as easily make the argument that marriage shouldn't be given to anyone, including straight couples, until those questions are answered.\n \n \nThen you're talking about a SOCIAL thing. There are two different issues here: government benefits for couples and social \"recognition\" of gays (which you've already admitted is \"socially\" and \"culturally\" (not government). The term, from the government's standpoint, certainly DOES ONLY mean benefits. It makes no difference to me what you call it culturally. You are free to call your union anything you want, I don't care. That's nothing more than a symbolic gesture.\n\n \n Speaking of it as \"symbolism\" would indicate the word \"marriage\" has social meaning. This is true whether it applies to gays or straights, and regardless of whether or not the government or whomever is in charge of benefits. The word is what society and the government, uses to apply to relationships it wants to support, respect and encourage. This could have the same positive results for gays as for straights. The government is working on behalf of society in any event, and is not in a benefits-only vaccum. That's not reality. The government does define marriage, sometimes with direction from the court. So it is not only concerned with benefits. Suggesting it should be, is another argument entierly and not an argument that gays should be kept out of marriage. \n \n \nThey are only personal morals. That's what morals are. I can't make you hold to any given morality any more than you can make ME do so. Morals are always personal beliefs. Look, you're so overly sensitive on this issue it's practically impossible to have a conversation with you on it. No one here is saying you're not \"human\"--that's your propagandist rhetoric talking-points speaking.\n\n \n I think I've described why sexual orientation is an important aspect of my humanity. It's the only way I have sexual love for example. It can be compared to heterosexual orientation on that basis. So, excluding me, discriminating, based on that, for no reason, is an insult to my humanity. We don't exclude the people we like just for being who they are. To sugarcoat this reality with nice-sounding words, is to give the exclusion unwarranted respect, and perhaps to make some people feel better about doing what we can reason to be wrong. And to keep on doing it. Tradition be damned in this case.\n \n \nSorry, but I don't care if you think it's 'evil'--you aren't the final word on what's evil or right and wrong, and you labeling objection as such doesn't make it so. (Though again, I think you're just using tactics here because you HAVE to know better.)\n\n \n Yes, I know you don't care. That's the problem with the right-wing, whether religious or not. Social issues are more complex than they want to understand. So they say in simple terms, this is my right to believe as I do, or this is the way we've always done it, so why change, etc., etc. There may be very good reasons to change and to re-examine and change our beliefs in the light of new knowledge. I've tried to give that greater breadth of knowledge on the reality of gay/homosexual identity and how it relates to broader issues in society, like the need to have our relationships given the same respect, encouragement, support and recogniton as straight couples, in tangible and intangible terms, including in marriage. I believe I have given a logical appeal to reason on this issue. Most of the straight people who support gay rights, including some in this forum, seem to have the same understanding about how unjustified this exclusion and discrimination is, however you dress it up, or provocatively dress it down(it doesn't mean I'm wrong about it being unjust), as I do.\n \n All you want to offer jyoshu, is just more of the same this is my belief, so there, drivel. Faluty analogies, and you criticize me for pointing out they are faulty and that there are better analogies. As though it's about me not wanting to have the cause associated with some things. I did explain my reasoning, so it's not that simple, and besides the point anyway. Diversion, diversion. \n \n \nBut maybe you really don't realize how out-of-touch and unrooted in reality this view of yours is that religious objection automatically = hate and thinking you aren't human, or whatever. People are multi-faceted, Jake.\n \n \n Sometimes, like I said, they are not fully conscious of what they are doing, because they've been taught to treat homosexuality a certain way for a very long time. That's just the way \"those people\" with \"those feelings\" are to be treated, excluded. But you don't do that because you are showing an embracing feeling of love and acceptance towards it. You are suspicious, fearful, not understanding it correctly, that it's just us as people being who we are. You think on some level it's bad, compared to what is accepted.\n \n \nNo matter how 'innate' it really is, it doesn't change the religious doctrinal view. Principles wouldn't exactly be very solid if they're dependent entirely on whether or not something seems natural to someone, now would they?\n\n \n Where in the world have I claimed \"dependent entirely on whether or not something seems natural\"? That's a bold strawman misrepresentation. Foundit has mentioned your love of strawmen too. Now I am starting to see it. Honestly, although I know I'm not perfect, I have to say this tactic of yours is annoying. \n \n \nSure, no one's denying that. So people need to learn to object to things without demeaning them. That's certainly true. Religious belief should conduct it's objections without dehumanizing people.\n\n \n Excluding gay people simply for being who they are, as humans, dehumanizes us. Now there are various degrees of course. But it can't be said to be benign, in reality.\n \n \nBut I think if you're being honest here, you'd come right out and say what you really want is not so much for religion to stop dehumanizing, but for religion to be silent on this matter and give up all its principles on this. You just don't like it because it's an example of someone saying something YOU'RE doing is wrong, in their opinion. The whole thing about \"negative social effects\" is a canard--an excuse--you just don't want any objection from religion, period. You don't want religion to [i]be[i] religion, in this case.\n\n \n Another strawman. I'm not arguing that I want to stop religion. I want religion, as part of society, and the rest of society, to treat gay people with the same respect, embrace, and celebration, and inclusion, as they treat straight people. This doesn't mean treating gay people with the same respect, provided we don't act gay or you don't have to see it.\n \n \nBah. Sexuality is not the be-all and end-all of things.\n\n \n Strawman. I said it was important, not everything. But the only way we who are gay have to express this part of our humanity, is by our homosexuality, obviously. It's the fundamental part of our sexual identity as humans. this is also the case with straight people, and their heterosexuality. Are you really not getting this?\n \n \nWhether or not the government used the \"M\" word for my relationship with someone is certainly not \"fundamental\" to me, and I see no reason to pander to you just because something like that is fundamental to you. You conflate things like \"expression\" and \"deeply\" with things like the M word and governmental benefits. It makes no sense, really.\n\n \n Because the right to marry means nothing, if you can't marry someone you love of your choice. And this is the only way gay people can express sexual love. The government controls marriage for certain purposes, besides only benefits. I explained this earlier in this post. If civil marriage has no meaning to you, why do you care if gays have it?",

   "I shouldn't need to change their mind--it's not my problem, Foundit, it's yours--you need to change their mind if you want it changed. \n\n No. I don't \"need to change\" anybody's mind.\n I've already got majority support for every gay rights issue but one. The sole exception is gay marriage, and marriage is a right. It's not up to your \"opinion\" as to whether or not I get gay marriage.\n Quite frankly, if people like YOU want to prevent gay marriage, you would do well to try to make sure that \"civil unions\" is an accepted solution.\n Cause otherwise, like with interracial marriage before, it's going to be out of your hands...\n \n \n \nThey are not my \"fellow Christians\"; no Christian is part of some card-carrying membership.\n\n I think your bible would have some words with you on the subject, regarding your \"brothers and sisters\" in Christ. It's not like there's a casual relationship whereupon you guys just like the same car. Your bible explains it is much deeper than that...\n I believe there are also bible passages on correcting your fellow Christians... Guidance from your God to you...\n But like I said, I don't really care if you ignore your bible as long as it doesn't affect me...\n \n But going a step beyond you following what the bible says, I've already posted multiple impacts that \"anti-gay Christianity\" is having upon the Christian population itself. More and more, the youth are seeing Christianity as something they don't want to be a part of.\n But if you don't have any interest in following you're God's commands on \"recruiting\", and you allow these actions which deter from that goal, I guess that's your own outlook.\n \n \n \nIf that's it, then there's nothing you've said in terms of marriage that can't also be said about other people that don't get to be married. \n\n That's a blatant falsehood.\n I have repeatedly explained the difference of a lack of a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST when it comes to the issue of gay marriage.\n You can keep ignoring that if you like. I'll keep repeating it for you...\n \n \n \nSo is it harming 17 year olds that they can't serve in the military?\n\n The state has an interest in insuring mature adults join. It has decided to institute an age limit to that effect.\n Legitimate State Interest...\n \n \n \nIs it harming ex-prisoners that they can't adopt in many cases?\n\n The state has an interest in insuring good parents for orphans.\n Legitimate State Interest...\n \n \n \nIt's really more a case of just not being able to do what you want to do.\n\n I could say the same for any Christian claimed pretense of discrimination...\n But in the end, such quibblings are irrelevant. The government is not entitled to arbitrarily discriminate without a Legitimate State Interest....\n (You sensing a trend here?)\n \n Moreover, there is a more fundamental question at work here.\n Suppose that the government GAVE some benefit to \"whites\" and never blacks, that was assumed not to \"harm\" blacks in any way.\n Would that be legal?\n Or would the government have to PROVE WHY they were justified in the discrimination in order to allow it to perpetuate???\n \n \n \nI'll remember that, the next time you yourself do that very sort of thing.\n\n Ahh yes. The age ol' \"I know you are but what am I?\"\n You're welcome to try, but we both know that I am typically dead-on in my assessment.\n \n \n \nWell that's the point. A 17 year old can easily be more mature (depending on the kid) than a given 18 year old, and VALIDLY say he can't marry the person he LOVES. Yet you support such discrimination, then argue against the discrimination of gays being unable to marry, claiming that very same reason.\n\n I feel I have to repeat myself here...\n Considering I never said ANY of that...\n And I never intimated that such a restriction should NEVER have ANY limits...\n \n But supporting SOME age of consent legislation does not mean anything about military service. You again assume my position.\n And as for 17-year olds, I don't support a strict \"18-only\" age of consent law.\n \n You really need to stop trying to pretend my position in order to claw for ground. It just looks desparate on you...\n \n \n \nBut the age of consent is arbitrary.\n\n The AGE may be viewed as potentially arbitrary.\n The ARGUMENT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF AN \"age of consent\"? No.\n Do you support pedophiles who feel any form of age of consent law should be eliminated?\n If you oppose them, do you think your position is \"arbitrary\"?\n \n \n \nI hold to the idea that the anti-gay crowd can be likened to the KKK.\n\n \nI know you do. no doubt that you think that, believe me. Just like some hold to the offensive idea of likening gays to pedophiles.\n\n It's really boring how you just say \"well, because Jack says X, then I can say Y\"...\n But you IGNORE THE REASONS WHY Jack CAN say \"X\", and you IGNORE THE REASONS WHY it's invalid for you to say \"Y\".\n Pedophiles RAPE KIDS.\n Homosexual relations are about two CONSENTING ADULTS.\n \n The modern KKK is about people who view a group (blacks) as inferior and typically with inferior rights.\n The modern Khristian anti-gay crowd is about people who view a group (gays) as inferior and typically with inferior rights.\n \n Your responses are typically so shallow and one-dimensional. You repeatedly ignore the REASONING behind people's statements...\n \n \n \nYou're conflating racism and moralistic views, two things that are often not the same thing.\n\n Racism IS a \"moralistic\" view.\n It's a deeply flawed one, but it IS a moralistic view.\n Just because a view is religious, doesn't mean it can't be prejudice.\n Just because a view is \"racist\" doesn't mean it's not moralistic.\n \n \n \nFoundit, YOU'RE the one who just said you liken it to the KKK. So OBVIOUSLY YOU think opposing gay rights is related to racism. \n\n In the APPROACH TO THINKING of the PREJUDICED people, they are alike.\n That's not to say that I think \"if there is a racist, that makes him anti-gay\" or \"if there is a homophobe, that makes him racist\".\n I swear. I waste more time explaining the obvious to you, and even then you don't seem to listen...\n \n \n \nBut not gay marriage. I didn't say \"marriage\", I said \"gay marriage.\"\n\n Do you realize how limited that approach is?\n It's like saying \"voting is a right, but not black/gay/white/Jewish voting\".\n You, and others, fail to grasp the IMPORTANCE of a classification of \"right\".\n Do you realize how useless the \"right\" would be if you could ignore the meaning of the \"right\" just by tossing an adjective or noun before the right name?\n \n It's like saying \"free speech\" is a right, but not \"political speech\".\n It's bizarre to me that people think that just attaching a descriptor before the right somehow means something significant in the classification of rights...\n With ANY right, the issue becomes verifying whether or not a legitimate state interest exists in the described form of discrimination.\n But with people who approach it like you, it doesn't matter cause if you say \"gay marriage\", the whole \"RIGHT REQUIREMENTS\" instituted by the constitution just magically goes out the window.\n \n What would you say to somebody who says \"interracial marriage is not a right\" if you cannot reference Loving v Virginia?\n And DO YOU UNDERSTAND the thought process so explicitly demonstrated in Loving v Virginia?\n Obviously not....\n \n \n \nAlcohol use IS a right.\n\n I would welcome you to show me any constitutional interpretation or legal document which establishes that.\n It's just plain false, and it demonstrates how little you understand about our American rights...\n \n \n \nActually, I'd LOVE to hear what (other than the fact it's not expressly forbidden) your \"solid argument\" is in terms of the constitution. Because most arguments based on the 14th amendment are just THAT: the fact it doesn't expressly forbid it.\n\n Wow.\n Just WOW!\n I KNOW you have heard my argument on the 14th amendment, so I take your statement here as little more than a request that I waste my time for you to obfuscate some more...\n \n I would LOVE to see you show me ANYBODY's argument for gay marriage which revolves around \"14th amendment / it doesn't expressly forbid it\".\n I have NEVER seen anybody pose that argument, and your claim is just another example of a boring falsehood on your part...\n \n The legal argument (which has been explained to you before) is that the 14th amendment REQUIRES the state show a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST before discriminating against a right. No such interest exists for discriminating against gay marriage.\n \n \n \nLOL. Foundit, that's because YOU'RE all over the place. Your goalposts have been all over the field here.\n\n Nope.\n I say \"that car is black\", and all of a sudden you start insisting I am saying the garage is black.\n That ain't \"moving the goalposts\".\n You're just floundering for an argument to make, but you don't have a basis...\n \n \n \nThen why didn't you answer that with a response about LEGISLATION? You didn't. You answered a question about legislation with a response about posts on a message board.\n\n I did answer the question. The answer WAS the posts on this message board. NUMEROUS examples.\n To remind you...\n foundit66: I swear. Do you READ the threads you post on???\n There have been NUMEROUS threads and NUMEROUS posts on how some people claim gays are \"detrimental to society\".\n Nitwits on the 11:00 news claim that gay marriage will cause Sodom and Ghomorrah results.\n There was a public meeting on legislation to prevent EMPLOYMENT discrimination against gays, and there are people in the audience holding up signs that say \"protect our children\"...\n \n Do I really need to remind you of all this junk?\n Since the answer is yes, let me remind you (for one example) of the threads which examine the absurd pretense that allowing gay marriage will somehow \"harm society\".\n The pretense that allowing gay adoption will \"harm children\".\n \n \n \nCome on, get real Foundit. In terms of this issue, the religious view IS A MORALISTIC view, Foundit.\n\n All you're doing is trying to find a new way to describe it, while doing absolutely nothing to disprove the original assessment.\n \n \n \nYou can't just take anything religious people believe is important and say they can't support legislation or other govt. action just because it happens to be something their religion entails. That is NOT the status quo of SoCS.\n\n I really don't care how hard you want to ignore reality...\n I support the status quo on separation of church and state.\n If you don't want to realize what that means, I don't care.\n I will just keep telling it like it is, and you will keep on showing you don't know what's going on.\n \n I'm not saying \"I support the status quo\" while having no clue as to what it means.\n Why do you think it is that in the court challenges on gay rights issues, \"because Christians believe ___\" is not an acceptable or even attempted justification for the legislation?\n Never mind. You're comfortable in your delusion.\n \n Do yourself a favor and review the \"Lemon Test\".\n \n \n \nAnd the very fact it's completely legal for them to do so only goes to SHOW it's not the status quo.\n\n Jyoshu, you don't seem to get it. Or you don't want to get it.\n While anybody can say \"we don't like blacks\" as a reason to vote for legislation denying blacks the right to vote, that does not mean it is legal to do so.\n That doesn't always mean a court will descend and stop the ballot. It sometimes means that AFTER the legislation is already in place, the COURTS will overturn it.\n I believe folks on your side of the aisle like to refer to it as \"judicial activism\"...\n \n \n \nFoundit, the problem is that your use of that is inconsistent here. The problem is that YOU DON'T differentiate.\n\n Wrong.\n I DO see a difference between a pastor IN THE PULPIT saying something, and a man on the streets, who isn't invoking religion but happens to be a pastor, saying something.\n And please don't try to tell me what my opinion is.\n Cause you KNOW the next step is for me to challenge you to prove your claim, and you KNOW you can't...\n I ask you to show where I have said I don't differentiate as I said.\n You try to show me saying \"the car is black\" in an effort to prove I said the garage is black.\n We both know how this ends. So do your detractors...\n \n \n \nIt's not like you only oppose this when it comes from \"pastors in pulpits\". You think it's \"imposing religion\" even if they aren't pastors in pulpits and just members of what you call anti-gay organizations.\n\n Wowza.\n Talk about a gross misrepresentation of my position, attempting to blur my actual position on multiple angles into one isomorphic pretense.\n 1) I do oppose \"pastors in pulpits\" preaching politics. In the interests of separation of church and state.\n 2) That DOES NOT mean that Christians don't pursue other avenues. In the interests of protecting gay equality.\n 3) It has also been shown that the anti-gay organizations have a Christian basis.\n \n Sometimes I feel like you need a Venn diagram to show you where you went wrong.\n I oppose X.\n I oppose Y.\n And what you are doing is trying to insist that I am inconsistent because I oppose something that is not X, but then failing to have the intellectual honesty to admit that I obviously would oppose it on the grounds that it IS \"Y\".\n If a pastor wants to talk about his political view outside a church, without religious pretense, he is welcome to.\n \n \n \nWell, that's indeed about how likely it was that you were already planning to say it wasn't \"significant\" .... \n\n I think that's more indicative of the reality of the situation, which you yourself know but refuse to admit cause you want to obfuscate it and pretend something else is going on.\n If you were to argue \"You can go outside in rain, without an umbrella, and travel 100 miles on foot without getting wet\", then it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how somebody's going to respond.\n You have presented an absurd claim, and instead of admitting it, you whine about the standards that are used to show your claim absurd...\n \n \n \nNo they don't. They deal with it IN DIFFERENT WAYS. I already told you that.\n\n Yeah, yeah, yeah...\n You keep saying things that aren't true, and I keep refuting you.\n Ain't it a bummer.\n \n Just cause a way is \"different' doesn't preclude it from being a significant magnitude difference in focus.\n You're trying to refute \"the garage is red\" by saying \"the garage can fit two cars\".\n You just saying \"different\" doesn't argue against the fact that there is a HUGE gay fixation, while the attention paid to the first commandment is relatively minor.\n \n If you had one set of KKK clans that attempted to institute legislation, had a multi-million dollar budget for doing so, and also used this money in efforts to malign blacks publicly, trying to \"teach\" the public that blacks are bad. They also taught their children that blacks were bad, and preached it from the pulpit...\n And then you had a second set of KKK clans, that just taught their kids that blacks were bad and preached it from the pulpit...\n You would honestly say that the first clan was just \"different\" from the second, and that you would argue against anybody who said the first clan was worse?\n \n \n \nI even gave you examples, telling you that one is dealt with via organizations and the other with teaching and preaching WITHIN the church.\n\n Let's put this in ACCURATE perspective.\n The \"gay issue\" is deal with via numerous organizations, multi-million dollar financing, and with teaching and preaching WITHIN the church.\n The \"first commandment\" issue is ONLY dealt with teaching and preaching WITHIN the church.\n \n It's like saying \"Jack was attacked with a nuclear bomb, a gun, and a knife. John was attacked with a knife. The response to Jack was just \"different\"\"...\n \n \n \nGay-related issues are NOT dealt with much in preaching and teaching.\n\n My mind is reeling on the blatantly obviously false nature of that claim.\n I am astounded you even tried to pass it off as true. And that's saying a lot when it comes to you...\n \n All I have to do is grab a few snippets from internet feed to prove this a ridiculous falsehood on your part. There was that anti-gay pastor in Colorado who turned out to be gay himself. Phelps. Roberts. Falwell.\n They all preach and teach that homosexuality is bad.\n \n \n \nGo to church in most any church for awhile if you don't believe me.\n\n Jyoshu, I don't need to.\n I've talked to Christians at my place of work. They have NEVER heard the pastor railing against violators of the first commandment, regarding Jews, Buddhists, etc, etc...\n But there are quite a few who are trying to preach what to do on the upcoming \"proposition 8\" California issue.\n I don't know what rock you live under, but you should really come out and join the real world every once in a while.\n \n \n \n(Sigh... ) So much for realistic representations on your part.\n Have you just given up arguing with honesty? 'Cause if you want to compare the number of these anti-gay organisations with the number of churches out there with average pastors preaching, you and I both know you would lose on that one.\n\n Actually, you're very wrong on that claim.\n I challenged you to PROVE significance on your claim, and you know you can't so you whine about the request to neuter the realization that you COMPLETELY FAILED to provide any evidence.\n \n The main thing regarding the \"significant\" thing is I wanted to show you couldn't move past the \"anecdotal\" story you keep telling on that. Your claims regarding your experience.\n You have provided ABSOLUTELY NO independently verifiable evidence for anybody to believe your claim.\n I think I'll just have to make up a poll to see how many people see your \"claims\" as accurate.\n \n \n \nI don't have to prove to you these churches DON'T focus on being anti-gay; you need to PROVE your accusation if you think they DO.\n\n Talk about moving the goal-posts...\n Okay. Let's put out some challenges that I know you'll avoid...\n Can you show ANYWHERE where I said that there aren't churches that \"don't focus on being anti-gay\"?\n The issue was you proving your claim that there is some form of push in the church to enforce the first commandment.\n \n And the really funny part about all this is that you KEEP WHINING about me asking for you to show SIGNIFICANT efforts, but then you turn around and complain that you think the \"first commandment\" push is similar to the \"anti-gay\" push, but just \"different\"...\n I mean, I don't think there is any confusion that the anti-gay initiative by prejudiced Christians is significant when you look at the multiple, nation-wide organizations that have multi-million dollar budgets from Christian donations in order to try to ensure legislated discrimination against gays and their attempts to slander gays.\n That's significant.\n But when I say that is far exceeding the first commandment push, you whine that it's just \"different\" while you refuse to try to show significance.\n \n Quite frankly, that's like me showing there are a large amount of marbles in jar A and that it's by far larger than jar B, and then you complain and come around and say that the marbles in Jar B are just \"different\", but you refuse to show any evidence on how many are in there...\n \n \n \nAnd then you whine 'cause some people have stopped engaging you and even put you on ignore. THIS sort of thing is exactly WHY that happens, Foundit. \n\n Oh jyoshu.\n I REALLY wish I could take up a poll as to how many people \"ignore\" your posts, but think you're full of manure...\n ... and how many think the same of me.\n But I suspect the moderator would squash such a demonstration.\n \n I don't care if you put me on ignore, jyoshu.\n I just think it is amazingly stupid to put me on ignore for \"insults\", but then you comiserate with Steeeeve when he insults me.\n It just proves how unbelievably shallow your original complaint truly is.\n \n \n \nYour whole argument on all this is one colossal over-simplification to the Nth Degree. Different issues in Christendom are dealt with in different ways, but you keep insisting on IGNORING the issue of method to SOLELY try to turn this into an issue of DEGREE.\n\n Just because things are dealt with \"differently\" doesn't mean that things aren't dealt with in different degrees.\n \n \n \nI suppose we should assume that gay rights advocates all deal with every issue exactly the same, with no difference in method.\n\n No. Not at all.\n I'm not pretending that they are.\n YOU are...\n I will happily admit that there is more of an interest on some gay rights issues than others...\n Heck. I've already admitted that if you were listening...\n But of course, you're trying desperately to pretend I am guilty of something you KNOW you are guilty of, so the fact that I have NEVER CLAIMED \"no difference\" doesn't even register, does it...",

   "No. I don't \"need to change\" anybody's mind.\n I've already got majority support for every gay rights issue but one. \n\n \n Which happens to be the issue were were talking about. :)\n \n Any other issues are pretty much beside the point here--as you know I already agree with you on that stuff.\n \n \nThe sole exception is gay marriage, and marriage is a right. It's not up to your \"opinion\" as to whether or not I get gay marriage. Quite frankly, if people like YOU want to prevent gay marriage, you would do well to try to make sure that \"civil unions\" is an accepted solution.\n\n \n Why are you even saying that when I've made it clear to you time and time again that such civil unions ARE what I think we should do??? You bring that up as if it hasn't been my stance all along. emoticon_rolleyes More Foundit obfuscation, I guess.\n \n I disagree with you that society can't decide how we define marriage. It ALWAYS decides it's standards. That's WHY we're having this discussion, because you want society to decide to change it to something else--something broader.\n \n \nCause otherwise, like with interracial marriage before, it's going to be out of your hands...\n \n The modern KKK is about people who view a group (blacks) as inferior and typically with inferior rights.\n The modern Khristian anti-gay crowd is about people who view a group (gays) as inferior and typically with inferior rights.\n \n\n \n If it's out of society's hands, then we're basically no longer a free society. A society that can't even set it's own standards is no longer by the people and for the people. Tyranny already. Interracial marriage wouldn't have become legal had not society moved enough in that direction to accept it--why do you think the issue had not even come up as a legal one in the past? \n \n At any rate, it's interesting that you tend to look at interracial marriage and racism as sort of a defacto analogy to this. While I agree there are similarities (just as there are to many issues) I don't think it was ever nearly the moralistic and doctrinal issue that gay marriage is, and over which so much of the objection is based.\n \n \nI think your bible would have some words with you on the subject, regarding your \"brothers and sisters\" in Christ. It's not like there's a casual relationship whereupon you guys just like the same car.\n\n \n The Bible says to do that when they SIN. If someone goes out and harms gays--hits them or physically abuses them yet says that they do it because they are Christians, you would see plenty of other Christians opposing that. You saw it with the Matthew Shepard incident. Religious opposition to gay marriage falls under a moralistic opinion category. It's not the same thing--you just portray it as the same thing because associating it with \"harm\" gives you a form of propaganda to engage in. But with the standard you're using to say that's \"harming\", most ANY issue could be tied to be harmful. It's silly, really. \n \n \nBut like I said, I don't really care if you ignore your bible as long as it doesn't affect me...\n\n \n Oh no, of course not. You've just made an issue of it several times for nothing. \n \n \nBut going a step beyond you following what the bible says .... \n\n \n No, stop right there. The ONLY way that's the case is if everyone ascribes to YOUR standard that not-broadening marriage is a form of harm. That's an arbitrary stance, and most ANY issue could be said to be \"harmful\" with that sort of approach. Sorry, but people should be able to have the religious opinion that marriage shouldn't be broadened without being accused of being sinful. Your approach is a classic case of begging the question. Frankly this constant disagree=hate/harm strategy and tactic gets tiresome, and anyone with an ounce of objectivity can see it for what it is: a tactic on your part. If you're going to go in such arbitrary circles to apply those Biblical passages to people who disagree on gay marriage legality, then they might as well be able to arbitrarily invoke OTHER passages that JUSTIFIES their disagreement with you. Such as the passages that so many view as forbidding gay relationships. Or even things that are even more of a stretch, such as loving one's neighbor by protecting society from degradation of traditional values. And before you freak out, I'm not defending that mentality here; I'm using it to show how much it's a stretch for YOU to use those passages about correcting other Christians in this context just because they oppose gay marriage.\n \n \nI've already posted multiple impacts that \"anti-gay Christianity\" is having upon the Christian population itself. More and more, the youth are seeing Christianity as something they don't want to be a part of.\n But if you don't have any interest in following you're God's commands on \"recruiting\", and you allow these actions which deter from that goal, I guess that's your own outlook.\n\n \n Foundit, you've brought that up numerous times, and it's somewhat humorous when you do. This whole thing you keep bringing up about youth abandoning Christianity is sort of like making an issue of a city like LA loosing some people, as if it were in danger of not becoming a city anymore. Mainline religions have always been ebbs-and-flows. Not to mention that your oversimplification doesn't take into account that in OTHER parts of the world, Christianity is definitely on the INCREASE.\n \n As if it really has any bearing on the issue at hand anyway. The issues afoot here don't depend on whether people are leaving Christianity or not--the merits of their arguments don't rest on that.\n \n And there's no commandment in scripture that says Christianity had BETTER be on an upward swing in terms of numbers, \"or else.\" \n \n Frankly, your little attempts here to try and pit Christians against their own Bible is pretty sad when you have to basically become a fundie in how you read the Bible to do so. ... more fundie than most Christians ever do or need to do, that's for sure. But I think you're only ever going to give them damned-if-you-do/damned-if-you-don't approach anyway. (Unless of course, they were to suddenly take up YOUR preferences and opinions on all the issues, in which case I suspect you'd suddenly be a lot less interested in all this trying to pit Christians against their own scripture. After all, you never seem to do it toward gay-rights Christians like Mel White or D.Tutu, when they're obviously going against numerous OT scriptures with their more liberal views on a variety of subjects.) \n \n \nThat's a blatant falsehood.\n I have repeatedly explained the difference of a lack of a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST\n \n The state has an interest ...\n \n Legitimate State Interest...\n \n The state has an interest ...\n\n \n The state could be said to not have a legitimate interest in any number of things they don't currently recognize. It could be said there's not a \"legitimate state interest\" to deny letting polygamists marry, but we still don't do it. \"Legitimate state interests\" is what you're trying to convince society that there need not be. Because society views gay relations as a vice, not an accepted part of everyday life. We all know there NEEDS to be a legitimate state interest--it's just that society believes there IS. You want a \"Status quo\" view .... well THERE is one.\n \n And frankly, you have just proven what I said about resting your arguments on the concept it should be allowed if not expressly FORBIDDEN. You're essentially saying that it HAS to be allowed (NOT discriminated against) if there's no legitimate state interests (no reason to expressly forbid). You're just putting what I said your arguments are, in different terms.\n \n \nMoreover, there is a more fundamental question at work here. Suppose that the government GAVE some benefit to \"whites\" and never blacks, that was assumed not to \"harm\" blacks in any way.\n Would that be legal?\n\n \n The concept of \"harm\" IS INDEED a stretch to say the least. There may be a case of legal discrimination or separate-but-equal thing going on, but, claiming that's a case of \"harm\" is really nothing more than a form of rhetoric. Someone can only be harmed by taking away what they already had or rely on; you can't really make the case for harm based on something they didn't already have. Marriage benefits are BENEFITS. They are over and above what is already there to begin with--if we use such thinking that not having benefits is harm, then we might as well say that every dating couple that has never tied the knot is \"HARMING\" themselves by not getting married. This whole harm thing is a stretch, to say the least. You'd do better to use arguments that deal more with separate-but-equal, rather than claiming to be \"harmed.\"\n \n \nOr would the government have to PROVE WHY they were justified in the discrimination in order to allow it to perpetuate???\n\n \n Well that's all fine and good, but we need to know that we're opening a pandora's box if we're going to start viewing couples' benefits that way. It's a sea-change in how we view that, and the implications certainly aren't limited to just unions between two gays. Furthermore, I think the issue of full-benefits civil unions addresses all this. From the government's standpoint, all that matters here is really couples' benefits. That's the bottom line for anything that's not entirely a cultural construct here.\n \n \nYou're welcome to try, but we both know that I am typically dead-on in my assessment.\n\n \n (snicker) Yeah. Ok, Foundit. Whatever you want to think .... emoticon_xangel\n \n \nBut supporting SOME age of consent legislation does not mean anything about military service. You again assume my position. And as for 17-year olds, I don't support a strict \"18-only\" age of consent law.\n\n \n Whether YOU support it or not is not the point. What is the point is that it shows we certainly DO discriminate without LEGITIMATE interests, because it's not legitimate to deny a mature 17 year old the right to marry. If you argue that it is, then I think you'd be hard-pressed to tell that 17 year old why she shouldn't be able to marry. (You might even have to explain why she isn't being \"HARMED\" as a result of such discrimination if she's using the same sort of logic you do.)\n \n \nto stop trying to pretend my position in order to claw for ground. It just looks desparate on you...\n \n You're just floundering for an argument to make, but you don't have a basis...\n \n\n \n \"Claw for ground\"? LOL. No one's trying to \"gain ground\" or \"claw\" for anything here--you're just wrong, Foundit. Believe it or not, not everyone views these discussions as some football game. You're comments here are reminiscent of a player trying to go around tackling and hitting everyone in an event everyone else views as a friendly game of flag football. \n \n \nThe AGE may be viewed as potentially arbitrary.\n The ARGUMENT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF AN \"age of consent\"? No.\n\n \n Well there's a comment that's beside the point, if I ever saw one. At least you're agreeing that discrimination exists that's arbitrary though. it's a start.\n \n \nRacism IS a \"moralistic\" view.\n\n \n I disagree that it's always such a case. I think it's usually a form of PREJUDICE, which is not moralistic thinking. There's a difference. Prejudice is saying \"I don't like those people.\" But morals are concerned with actions--like when someone says \"it's immoral to stalk people or blackmail them\". I think that's ultimately the fundamental difference between those two issues. Religious doctrine doesn't tell religious people that gays are inferior people, not \"human\", or whatever gay-rights-proponents SAY religious people think. It simply says that certain actions are wrong and that's why the comparison with racism doesn't always work. \n \n \nJust because a view is religious, doesn't mean it can't be prejudice.\n \n Just because a view is \"racist\" doesn't mean it's not moralistic.\n \n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes :xbanghead\n \n There you go again. NO ONE said it \"CAN'T\" be prejudice, Foundit. No one said racism was NEVER moralistic. WHERE did anyone say that? STOP changing from arguing a positive assertion about some things to defend as if anyone argued a general assertion. 'Cause they haven't. YOU'RE the one that took an all-encompassing stance by racism IS a moralistic one--the general assertion was YOURS. Are you now saying racism can't ever be something that's NOT moralistic? \n \n \nIn the APPROACH TO THINKING of the PREJUDICED people, they are alike.\n\n \n It shouldn't be. Racism and irrational prejudice should be viewed as an immoral thing always--but one's morals should not incur a blanket condemnation of being wrong. \n \n \nDo you realize how limited that approach is?\n It's like saying \"voting is a right, but not black/gay/white/Jewish voting\".\n You, and others, fail to grasp the IMPORTANCE of a classification of \"right\".\n Do you realize how useless the \"right\" would be if you could ignore the meaning of the \"right\" just by tossing an adjective or noun before the right name?\n\n \n But those are examples society defines as within the definition of voting ALREADY. Your case is more like someone wanting to vote a DIFFERENT WAY, wanting to vote via raising their hand instead of paper or machine ballot, and saying \"but voting is a RIGHT, and I should be able to vote!\" when we don't define voting procedure that way at all. \n \n \n \n [QUOTE=foundit66;330308]It's like saying \"free speech\" is a right, but not \"political speech\".\n It's bizarre to me that people think that just attaching a descriptor before the right somehow means something significant in the classification of rights...\n \n \nWith ANY right, the issue becomes verifying whether or not a legitimate state interest exists in the described form of discrimination. But with people who approach it like you, it doesn't matter cause if you say \"gay marriage\", the whole \"RIGHT REQUIREMENTS\" instituted by the constitution just magically goes out the window.\n\n \n Nope, because you can't arbitrarily just add anything to marriage you want. You need to convince society marriage should be defined to include whatever new sort of arrangement you're wanting it to encompass.\n \n \nI would welcome you to show me any constitutional interpretation or legal document which establishes that [alcohol use is a right].\n It's just plain false, and it demonstrates how little you understand about our American rights...\n\n \n OMG. Foundit, seriously, it's YOUR THINKING that would assume something was a right (that can't be discriminated against) unless there's a legitimate reason for doing so. Since when are you changing your view to require a legal document or change in const. intepretation for assuming having a beer is a right???? \n \n You're going in so many directions at this point contradicting yourself, you're going to fly apart if you're not careful.\n \n \nI would LOVE to see you show me ANYBODY's argument for gay marriage which revolves around \"14th amendment / it doesn't expressly forbid it\".\n\n \n Then look at your OWN to see such an example. Your whole thing about \"legitimate state interest\" is EXACTLY that sort of argument. I can't imagine how you don't get that it is!!!\n \n \nI did answer the question. The answer WAS the posts on this message board. NUMEROUS examples.\n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes You just can't admit you got something wrong, can you? Just too much for your ego? This sport of yours means too much to you?\n \n You answered a question asking for legislative-based answers with a dim-witted response (trying to avoid it, no doubt) about posts on this board. That was a cop out, by the way. Your response and it's failure to address the question is so noted.\n \n \nI really don't care how hard you want to ignore reality...I support the status quo on separation of church and state.\n If you don't want to realize what that means, I don't care.\n\n \n Foundit, the problem isn't that *I* don't know what it means--the problem is that obviously YOU don't. It doesn't mean Christians can't stand for moralistic issues just because their morals happen to be affected by their religion. It doesn't even mean \n \n And your point about the lemon test does ABSOLUTELY nothing to prove your view of the status quo at all. If you were going by the lemon test, you wouldn't HAVE such a NON-status quo view that pastors can't say anything politcal from the pulpit. The lemon test doesn't mean pastors have to suddenly become political independents the instant they walk into their church. (Do I need to review the Lemon Test for you here? Everyone here knows about the Lemon Test, btw.) But more importantly, you'd stop this inconsistent garbage of acting like anti-gay ORGANIZATIONS are a breach of C&S when on the other hand you use the far more limited example of pastors in their pulpits.\n \n \nI will just keep telling it like it is, and you will keep on showing you don't know what's going on.\n\n \n Yeah, that's it, Foundit. emoticon_rolleyes You know everything and I know nothing. Difference of opinion is always really just people not knowing anything about it. Geez. Are you capable of just having a straight conversation without personal attacks thrown in?\n \n \nCause you KNOW the next step is for me to challenge you to prove your claim, and you KNOW you can't...\n\n \n Doh, Foundit is beating his chest again!! Everyone run! \n \n \nTalk about a gross misrepresentation of my position, attempting to blur my actual position on multiple angles into one isomorphic pretense.\n 1) I do oppose \"pastors in pulpits\" preaching politics. In the interests of separation of church and state.\n 2) That DOES NOT mean that Christians don't pursue other avenues. In the interests of protecting gay equality.\n 3) It has also been shown that the anti-gay organizations have a Christian basis.\n\n \n So which is it for you, Foundit?? Are anti-gay organizations that aren't happening in a church a breech of C&S or not?? Because at this point, you're as vague as ever.\n \n \nYou keep saying things that aren't true, and I keep refuting you.\n Ain't it a bummer.\n\n \n Doh, Foundit is doing a little trash talk!! I guess you think if you SAY it enough, it will somehow become true .... You haven't refuted a dang thing, Foundit. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nLet's put this in ACCURATE perspective.\n The \"gay issue\" is deal with via numerous organizations, multi-million dollar financing, and with teaching and preaching WITHIN the church.\n The \"first commandment\" issue is ONLY dealt with teaching and preaching WITHIN the church.\n\n \n No. You know, at this point I'm mainly interested in how you would prove this to be a breech of the first AMENDMENT, not the 1st commandment. (The pitting of this stuff against the Bible that you're trying to do is all matter-of-opinion stuff, and I know you're going to take a damned-if-you-do/if-you-don't approach on that regardless.) You throw out this generalized trash about it getting support from within the church. How does that make it a breech of C&S? how do these ORGANIZATIONS breech C&S just getting support from some churches??? In terms of LEGAL ARGUMENTS, not just your personal opnions against them.\n \n \nMy mind is reeling on the blatantly obviously false nature of that claim.I am astounded you even tried to pass it off as true. And that's saying a lot when it comes to you...\n\n \n More personal attacks. It's really unnecessary, and given that you've made such a big deal here about Steeeeve's comments from time to time, it's interesting that you engage in personal attacks yourself quite freely.\n \n \nAll I have to do is grab a few snippets from internet feed to prove this a ridiculous falsehood on your part. There was that anti-gay pastor in Colorado who turned out to be gay himself. Phelps. Roberts. Falwell.\n They all preach and teach that homosexuality is bad.\n\n \n Ooh, a few preachers. Who happen to be the ones that are KNOWN for that sort of thing. Foundit ..... Phelps, Roberson, and Falwell are not indicative of most churches out there. They are indicative of FUNDIE churches. That's what those preachers are: fundies. \n \n \nJyoshu, I don't need to.\n I've talked to Christians at my place of work. \n\n \n And you were whining with mischaracerizations saying that I was trying to use the idea \"may pastor said so\" to prove something. emoticon_rolleyes Then you go and base your opinion ABOUT ALL THOSE CHURCHES OUT THERE on something a few Christians at work tell you about?? Good grief. Why are you even still keeping this junk up, Foundit? \n \n \nI don't know what rock you live under, but you should really come out and join the real world every once in a while.\n\n \n The real world is that most people, churches, and pastors aren't nearly as gay-issue centered as you obviously think they are. You're everyone's-out-to-get-me approach is getting ridiculous at this point. You name off 5 well-known fundie pastors to show this. It's like someone saying atheism is out to get Christianity, and naming off Hitchens, Dawkins, and and a couple more to represent all atheists. Those guys are KNOWN anti-Christians who's views ago too far. They aren't indicative of the rest of atheism, thank goodness.\n \n \nTalk about moving the goal-posts...\n Okay. Let's put out some challenges that I know you'll avoid...\n Can you show ANYWHERE where I said that there aren't churches that \"don't focus on being anti-gay\"? The issue was you proving your claim that there is some form of push in the church to enforce the first commandment.\n\n \n No, I didn't say you did. And I have NOT claimed there was was \"some form of push in the church to enforce the first commandment\"--since you challenged me, I'll challenge you to show where I said they are trying to enforce that. What I said was that issues like the first commandment ARE taught about and given focus; it's just that different methods are used to do so than is often the case with gay-related issues. Geez, this is not something you should be disgreeable over. There is ABSOLUTELY no reason you should have to disagree with that statement other than pure belligerence. \n \n \nAnd the really funny part about all this is that you KEEP WHINING about me asking for you to show SIGNIFICANT efforts, but then you turn around and complain that you think the \"first commandment\" push is similar to the \"anti-gay\" push, but just \"different\"...\n\n \n I said it's not an issue of degree, but of METHOD, and it is. Please stop the falsehoods.\n \n And frankly, if Christians think society is in more danger to be affected by the issue of changing marriage than it is the first commandment--that one is a more impending danger than the other--why shouldn't they give one more DEGREE anyway??? You act as though it's automatically a bad thing for there to be more focus on one than the other. It would be different if Christians weren't focused at ALL on the first commandment, but that's just not the case and you and I both know that. And it's fascinating, really, that you're so focused on Christians anyway. I think you're just trying to deflect from the real issues here, personally.",

You bring that up as if it hasn't been my stance all along. emoticon_rolleyes More Foundit obfuscation, I guess.\n\n No.\n More Jyoshu obfuscation.\n REREAD what I said, understanding that I WAS TALKING ABOUT the fact that you want civil unions instead of gay marriage.\n THAT was my point.\n \n \n \nI disagree with you that society can't decide how we define marriage. It ALWAYS decides it's standards. That's WHY we're having this discussion, because you want society to decide to change it to something else--something broader.\n\n \"society\" may be able to decide.\n The GOVERNMENT is prohibited from making arbitrary discriminations on rights, by the guidelines of the constitution.\n \n What you said is the equivalent of me saying \"I disagree that the Christian God won't send all Christians to hell and everybody else to heaven.

A society that can't even set it's own standards is no longer by the people and for the people. Tyranny already. \n\n emoticon_frazzled\n Obviously society has the option of AMENDING the constitution.\n But as written, the constitution demands gay marriage be allowed.\n \n I find it hilarious that you put forth the perspective that if society is NOT allowed to discriminate, THAT is somehow \"tyranny\".\n A bit like arguing for good parenting by being allowed to beat your kid black and blue... emoticon_frazzled \n \n \n \n Interracial marriage wouldn't have become legal had not society moved enough in that direction to accept it--why do you think the issue had not even come up as a legal one in the past?\n\n Um. WHAT???\n You need a reality check.\n Loving v Virginia was decided in 1967, declaring it was unconstitutional to discriminate against interracial marriage.\n At that time, people OPPOSED interracial marriage by a margin of THREE to ONE. That's GREATER than today's margin against gay marriage (two to one).\n It wasn't until the late 80's/early 90's that society shifted to having more people for interracial marriage than against.\n And that's not even looking at all the states that outlawed miscegenation laws BEFORE 1967...\n \n The societal shift on interracial marriage happened AFTER the courts recognized it was a right. MUCH later...\n NOT before...\n \n \n \nAt any rate, it's interesting that you tend to look at interracial marriage and racism as sort of a defacto analogy to this. While I agree there are similarities (just as there are to many issues) I don't think it was ever nearly the moralistic and doctrinal issue that gay marriage is, and over which so much of the objection is based.\n\n Racism IS a moralistic view.\n Racism WAS a doctrinal issue.\n \n You are viewing history by colored glasses whereby you reinterpret things inaccurately.\n \n \n \nThe Bible says to do that when they SIN.\n\n Last time I checked, \"Thou shalt not bear false witness\" is still a sin. A sin that is broken by the anti-gay religious right.\n Last time I checked, Jesus DID say that people should concern themselves with the beam in their own eye instead of the mote in their neighbors. He said \"judge not, lest ye be judged\". If violating Jesus's own commands is not a sin, then what is?\n \n \n \nOh no, of course not. You've just made an issue of it several times for nothing. \n\n Jyoshu, I don't care if it rains today or not.\n Doesn't mean I won't still talk about the weather...\n emoticon_emb\n \n YOU obviously don't care to try to help gay rights issues.\n But you still talk about them, incessantly...\n \n \n \nNo, stop right there. The ONLY way that's the case is if everyone ascribes to YOUR standard that not-broadening marriage is a form of harm. That's an arbitrary stance, and most ANY issue could be said to be \"harmful\" with that sort of approach. Sorry, but people should be able to have the religious opinion that marriage shouldn't be broadened without being accused of being sinful. Your approach is a classic case of begging the question. Frankly this constant disagree=hate/harm strategy and tactic gets tiresome, and anyone with an ounce of objectivity can see it for what it is: a tactic on your part.\n\n No, stop right there. Multiple times over...\n 1) You're asking for the people against gay marriage be free to criticize gay marriage, while themselves being free from criticism. Um, NO.\n 2) It's been explained to you, REPEATEDLY, that peoples' OPINIONS are one thing.\n People ACTING upon those opinions, espousing discrimination against gays, THAT is the issue.\n So don't try to make this into a \"disagree=hate/harm\" thing, cause that is NOT what I am saying.\n The actions of the anti-gay groups? THAT is what is being claimed as the \"harm\".\n \n (And stop trying to insert \"hate\" into the thing. That only proves you're trying to purposely obfuscate...\n You put it in quotes, intimating that is my opinion, and we both know it isn't.)\n \n \n \nFoundit, you've brought that up numerous times, and it's somewhat humorous when you do. This whole thing you keep bringing up about youth abandoning Christianity is sort of like making an issue of a city like LA loosing some people, as if it were in danger of not becoming a city anymore. Mainline religions have always been ebbs-and-flows. Not to mention that your oversimplification doesn't take into account that in OTHER parts of the world, Christianity is definitely on the INCREASE.\n\n If you find ignoring Jesus's own words as \"humorous\", I guess that's your perspective.\n Jesus never told people to recruit for LA population.\n When CHRISTIANS act in a way that yields contrary results to Jesus's own commands, THAT is what I'm talking about.\n \n \n \nAnd there's no commandment in scripture that says Christianity had BETTER be on an upward swing in terms of numbers, \"or else.\"\n\n If you want to take that type of mentality, how many of the commandments or the \"gay\" passages have that approach? \n \n \n \nFrankly, your little attempts here to try and pit Christians against their own Bible is pretty sad when you have to basically become a fundie in how you read the Bible to do so.\n\n 1) Jyoshu, Christians ARE acting contrary to the dictates of their own bible. I am just pointing out that fact.\n 2) We can have a discussion on that if you want, cause I think you're being absurd in claiming that you have to be a \"fundie\" to reach my conclusion.\n My statement is an obvious conclusion of interpretation.\n \n Your approach would be like taking the \"Thou shalt not kill\" passage, saying that it prohibits John from swinging a brick to hit Mark on the head.\n But then if John causes the brick to fall on Mark's head, striking him by indirect action, THAT would be \"okay\" cause it would be a \"fundie\" interpretation to realize that John's actions are DIRECTLY causing the harm, but he's not directly \"swinging\" the brick himself.\n \n \n \nBut I think you're only ever going to give them damned-if-you-do/damned-if-you-don't approach anyway.\n\n It's not \"damned if you do/damned if you don't\".\n It's an issue where you don't like what your own bible tells you to do, and you want to follow your own way.\n Jesus never promised that following him would make you popular. In fact, he promised the opposite.\n \n \n \nThe state could be said to not have a legitimate interest in any number of things they don't currently recognize.\n\n Irrelevant.\n Just because you don't agree with the legitimate state interest doesn't mean it doesn't exist.\n There are clear guidelines on what CANNOT constitute a legitimate state interest, and invariably the \"anti-gay marriage\" crowd routinely violate them.\n \n Furthermore, do you think the existence of OTHER potential constitutional violation somehow means that the constitutional standard doesn't exist?\n No.\n \n Just because somebody \"could say\" that the Christian God is a demon, does that mean anything?",

MUCH later...\n NOT before...\n \n\n \n You misunderstand what I'm saying here. It's only because society finally changed enough to decide gay marriage is even valid to some that it's even viewed as a form of ILLEGITIMATE discrimination to begin with.\n \n It's only because society decided racial issues were bad enough that it became an issue enough for someone to even bring it forward in the courts. It wouldn't have happened AT ALL if society hadn't changed siginificantly on this. Can you imagine an interracial marriage case winning (or even being brought to trial) in the 19th century?? In the late 1860s? Or really even in the Jim Crow era?\n \n That process is going on with gay marriage, though whether or not society will ultimately come to same sort of conclusions remains to be seen. Your analogy of interracial marriage is valid from the standpoint that it's a form of marriage that is begin decided on by society in terms of whether or not the 'discrimination' is illegitimate. But that's where the analogy ends--it doesn't apply in terms of racism and is too different in terms of religion and moralistic values.\n \n \nWhat you said is the equivalent of me saying \"I disagree that the Christian God won't send all Christians to hell and everybody else to heaven. God can do what he wants.\"\n While what I said (and analogously what you said) is an opinion and your God would be capable of doing just that, it is obviously not reflective of the standard in question.\n\n \n Huh?? I don't really get this analogy. The bottom line I think is that society is determining how it wants to define marriage. Whether or not it's a broaden-able institution.\n \n \nObviously society has the option of AMENDING the constitution.\n But as written, the constitution demands gay marriage be allowed.\n \n I find it hilarious that you put forth the perspective that if society is NOT allowed to discriminate, THAT is somehow \"tyranny\".\n A bit like arguing for good parenting by being allowed to beat your kid black and blue... emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n Foundit, the whole idea that it's illegitimate discrimination is begging the question. THAT'S what society is trying to decide. I agree it's illegitimate, and that's why I think gays should have couples' benefits too. But it's still something society has to ultimately decide. Things that are brought to trial and legislation will be reflective of that over time.\n \n \nRacism WAS a doctrinal issue. You are viewing history by colored glasses whereby you reinterpret things inaccurately.\n \n\n \n Not on the order that homosexuality-related issues is. You're kidding yourself if you think it was on par. You're viewing history by attributing religion more than it really was. Religion was more often the excuse--the justification given. Racism was the problem. In the case of homosexuality matters, religion REALLY IS what's behind a lot of the opposition. There may be prejudice TOO, but that doesn't mean religion isn't a lot of what's behind it.\n \n \nLast time I checked, \"Thou shalt not bear false witness\" is still a sin. A sin that is broken by the anti-gay religious right.\n Last time I checked, Jesus DID say that people should concern themselves with the beam in their own eye instead of the mote in their neighbors. He said \"judge not, lest ye be judged\". If violating Jesus's own commands is not a sin, then what is?\n\n \n So, Christians should never take any stand on social moralistic issues, ever, since there will always be stuff in their own life that they need to contend with? Christians should never oppose anything? I guess ML King shouldn't have opposed racism since he should have been more concerned with whatever sins he committed himself. I swear. You enjoy trying to beat Christians over the head with their own scripture, and turn into a fundie in the process the way you approach it. And then if anyone dares mention any hypocrisy on YOUR part, you freak out. \n \n \nNo, stop right there.

So then you think they should just be restricted from working toward policy and legislation. No, that's not right either. They have just as much a right to participate in that process as you do. If you oppose that then you need to oppose anyone fighting for anti-gun laws, or to restrict peoples' environmental actions, or any number of other forms of people fighting for their views through ACTION. You're wanting these people to not be free to work toward putting their views in action. That's not right--you are free to oppose them of course, and fight for what YOU think is a better country too, but it's not your place to tell them they shouldn't participate in this process just because you frame the issue as a form of illegitimate discrimination. Everyone tries to fight for their morality to be put into policy.

   "I mean Ive read this thread and he's flip flopped so many times you would think he was making pancakes!\n\n \n Jason, respectfully, I'm only interested in debating with you here if you want to talk about the topics the thread is about. If that's something you want to do, I'm more than willing to do so. But I do respectfully ask that you debate the issues instead of trying to make me or anyone else as a poster an issue here, and making personal comments-- Neither I nor anyone else here as a poster is the topic of this thread, after all. If you do have a problem with my posts, you are welcome to report them to the admin whom (IMO) is quite fair, and to whom I would give full deference. I haven't posted any comments about you (as opposed to the issues the thread is about) to to this thread, in that way, and I don't think this is an unreasonable request. \n \n Again, I think you were courageous with your family and I respect that, and wish you the best. \n \n \n --------------------------------\n \n \n \n Jake, sorry it's taken me awhile to get back to this. To continue our discussion ...\n \n \nI didn't say it wasn't religious doctrine. I just said that religious doctrine may be discriminatory, exclusionary and hateful. It can have an awful or unjustifiably negative effect in reality.\n\n \n Sure, in some cases it MAY be. No one is disagreeing with that.\n \n \nIndeed, I know that. I don't see any other similarities to the things you mention. Other than your homosexuality \"once was\" treated this way or that way. Which is irrelevent to now.\n\n \n Historic examples are not rendered irrelevant just because they are a part of the past. If that were the case, no comparisons could ever be drawn to anything historic.\n \n \nNo, marriage is marriage. But polygamy, age of consent issues, are not necessarily at the root of its meaning. If they are, then you could obviously just as easily make the argument that marriage shouldn't be given to anyone, including straight couples, until those questions are answered.\n\n \n The only reason you can sit there and say they aren't is because they haven't have the PR movement that gay marriage has. In terms of the merits of the issues themselves (as opposed to the publicity and sections of society being convinced about it) they certainly are comparable. Certainly as much as gay marriage has been.\n \n \nSpeaking of it as \"symbolism\" would indicate the word \"marriage\" has social meaning. This is true whether it applies to gays or straights\n \n \n Well sure it has \"social meaning\", that's yet another thing no one here is saying otherwise. That's exactly WHY other groups would want to use it to gain more legitimacy. I think some gays feel it's must be the ultimate mark of validation. I just don't think validating any group that comes along is a good enough reason to start broadening what the \"M\" word is applied to. That's my opinion--obviously you're of a different one, and you're entitled to your opinion. emoticon_smile \n \n \nThe government does define marriage, sometimes with direction from the court. So it is not only concerned with benefits. Suggesting it should be, is another argument entierly and not an argument that gays should be kept out of marriage.\n\n \n I disagree--I see no reason to think that it's not culture that defines marriage, and government sometimes... usually... reflects that over time. Every case of broadening changes in marriage demonstrates that. For example, it was the culture that changed it's view of women BEFORE marriage was considered non-patriarchal by government and law. Another example is interracial marriage, in which there's no way such change would have occurred in far more racist times--such a thing would never have even come up in the courts. And remember-- marriage existed BEFORE this government we have that you say defines marriage. The government certainly doesn't define MY marriage; I'd hate to think THAT was the case. I'd be MARRIED with or without the government saying so. It's a very foreign thing to me for anyone to hinge so much on what the government says their union is--some even wait to tie the knot ONLY after a given state recognizes it! Perhaps this is just a fundamental difference in the way people who hold the sanctity of marriage in high regard think. I don't see how anyone who views it as a holy matrimony--for instance--could ever describe that as being \"defined by the government\". It's sort of a cheapening thing to say. If you say it's about LOVE--which you have, by using that argument for gay marriage--then you can't now tie marriage definition to something so cold and beurocratic as a 'government.'\n \n \nI think I've described why sexual orientation is an important aspect of my humanity. It's the only way I have sexual love for example. It can be compared to heterosexual orientation on that basis. So, excluding me, discriminating, based on that, for no reason, is an insult to my humanity. We don't exclude the people we like just for being who they are. \n\n \n \"Sexual orientation\" is another one of those things people put out there, when really broken down in terms of its implications, is problematic. People use that phrase cavalierly, when in reality many people don't so neatly fit into categories like that. They're basically just using another way of saying \"hey, I'm gay, not straight\" which is a form of circular reasoning. And what is the \"orientation\" of what is referred to as a \"bi-sexual\", for instance? They aren't gay. They aren't straight. Are they both, neither, or a little or each? (this demonstrates the problem with trying to fit people neatly into boxes, I think.) And what of cases where people are ORIENTED toward other things that don't ONLY pertain to opposite-gender versus same-gender? (I know ... I know, you don't want anything else out there even brought up here as a consideration. Well, I'm sorry but there's no way to honestly discuss these matters otherwise, when you start talking about what people are oriented toward.) It seems to me there's way more we don't know about this \"sexual orientation\" stuff than we do, and let's face it--it's a relatively newer concept in the grand scheme of things. I'm not saying it's not real, but I think it's often thrown out there too glibly. It's gotten to be a popular phrase due to the gay rights movement, no doubt.\n \n But even with that said, I'm fine with that concept in that I am in agreement to the extent that gay couples need to be given the couples' benefits just like anyone else would. It's fine! 'Equality' of benefits is ok with me, and IMO that's really the only equality issue that exists to begin with. Anything else is just wrangling over semantics. So, sure, it's only fair you should get couples' benefits by the government since you say it's just you being human. Again, that's WHY I am not opposed to civil unions.\n \n \nYes, I know you don't care. That's the problem with the right-wing, whether religious or not. Social issues are more complex than they want to understand. So they say in simple terms, this is my right to believe as I do, or this is the way we've always done it, so why change, etc., etc.\n\n \n No, no, no ..... uh uh. Stop the train; Katy, bar the door. I'm not going to let you get away with conflating issues here. What I'm saying I don't care about is what YOU think is evil or not. NOT what social issues are. YOU aren't the final word on whether social issues are evil or good. That has nothing to do with right-wing, left-wing, conservative, liberal, or whatever. the point is that you--JAKECJB--don't get to decide which position is evil or not. No one has appointed you Grand Mojo Pooba of morality and right and wrong. What you think is evil is a value judgment you're making based on what YOU think is right and wrong--YOUR morality. That's not \"re-examining\" that I'm talking about. Re-examining is always fine. But I suspect what you REALLY mean by \"re-examine\" is \"[i]take my moralistic view as the one everybody should adopt[i].\" Nothing wrong with arguing for your version of what's moral or not, but don't call it something it's not. Don't portray it in watered-down terms like you want people to \"re-examine\" things or 'things are more complex'. No, you have a view you want the world to be, just like everyone else does, including the \"right-wing\" (as you say). You just think your way is RIGHT, just like THEY do. You don't get to start with your position being more valid. That's something you have to convince society of, just like they do. That's what the marketplace of discourse is all about.\n \n \nThere may be very good reasons to change and to re-examine and change our beliefs\n\n \n Sure, there may be. Like I said, anything is always up for re-examining. What you really want is for everyone to take YOUR view, so call it what it is. No one's opposed to re-examining things, and that's not the issue. What the heck; people might as well say YOU need to re-examine things, if that's going to be the approach taken. \n \n \nI've tried to give that greater breadth of knowledge on the reality of gay/homosexual identity and how it relates to broader issues in society, like the need to have our relationships given the same respect, encouragement, support and recogniton as straight couples ....\n \n ... All you want to offer jyoshu, is just more of the same this is my belief, so there, drivel.\n\n \n No, I've told you over and over now, I'm for you getting the same couples' benefits. At this point you're just arguing over semantics. You're arguing over mode rather than substance.\n \n \nYou are suspicious, fearful, not understanding it correctly, that it's just us as people being who we are. You think on some level it's bad, compared to what is accepted.\n\n \n I don't care whether or not \"it's bad\", or not. I'm not telling you how to live your life. That's up to you. Knock yourself out; do what you want! I have NOT told you \"you can't do that.\" Nor will I, because it's none of my business. You're barking up the wrong tree here, frankly. \n \n \nWhere in the world have I claimed \"dependent entirely on whether or not something seems natural\"?\n\n \n You made an issue of this being about you just being human; that wasn't me, it was you. If that's not an argument about something being natural, I don't know what is.\n \n \nExcluding gay people simply for being who they are, as humans, dehumanizes us. Now there are various degrees of course. But it can't be said to be benign, in reality.\n\n \n Fine, so we shouldn't \"exclude\" them. I certainly have no problem with that.\n \n \nI'm not arguing that I want to stop religion. I want religion, as part of society, and the rest of society, to treat gay people with the same respect .... \n\n \n Mmm, no, when you adamantly oppose this religious view about homosexual relations, then you ARE saying you want to stop religion, at least some of it. People holding to these doctrinal views IS religion, and so when you say they can't do that, then you you're basically saying you want religion suppressed. When what you want done away with IS a part of religion, then you're basically saying you to stop at least THAT part of religion. Look, again, stop trying to sugar coat these things. Call your spade a spade.\n \n \nI said it was important, not everything.\n\n \n You said it was how they express who they are as humans. That's what YOU said. If you're now saying it's not so fundamental, then great. I'm glad to hear that.",

   "Jason, respectfully, I'm only interested in debating with you here if you want to talk about the topics the thread is about. If that's something you want to do, I'm more than willing to do so. But I do respectfully ask that you debate the issues instead of trying to make me or anyone else as a poster an issue here, and making personal comments-- Neither I nor anyone else here as a poster is the topic of this thread, after all. If you do have a problem with my posts, you are welcome to report them to the admin whom (IMO) is quite fair, and to whom I would give full deference. I haven't posted any comments about you (as opposed to the issues the thread is about) to to this thread, in that way, and I don't think this is an unreasonable request.\n\n \n Really though, he more attacked your arguments in his comments. You don't justify your position, with arguments. That is, if we can even determine what the position may be. \n \n \nSure, in some cases it MAY be. No one is disagreeing with that.\n\n \n Anytime you tell someone you're not good enough to be included, with no reason, it has a negative effect on that person.\n \n \nHistoric examples are not rendered irrelevant just because they are a part of the past. If that were the case, no comparisons could ever be drawn to anything historic.\n\n \n They are irrelevent in themselves, if you can't give a reason why they are relevent. You haven't made a case why these are relevent.\n \n \nThe only reason you can sit there and say they aren't is because they haven't have the PR movement that gay marriage has. In terms of the merits of the issues themselves (as opposed to the publicity and sections of society being convinced about it) they certainly are comparable. Certainly as much as gay marriage has been.\n\n \n Oh, really how so? All you've brought up is the minority issue. That's too broad a comparison. Polygamy equals different sexes and Christianity, thus polygamy has more in common with heterosexual Christian marriages. This has nothing to do with the fact that people have been working for equal marriage for same-sex couples. So what? The other side has been working against. What's that got to do with the cost of tea in China? \n \n \nWell sure it has \"social meaning\", that's yet another thing no one here is saying otherwise. That's exactly WHY other groups would want to use it to gain more legitimacy.\n\n \n Ok. \"Would want\"? Are you talking about government recognized civil marriages, here? Becuase that is the topic. And you say marriages don't have meaning suddenly if the government recognizes them, that they can and do go on anyway, with or without government validation. Why would other groups seek validation from government marriage, which you claim, has no meaning? Can you see why your position or lack thereof is confusing?\n \n \nI think some gays feel it's must be the ultimate mark of validation. I just don't think validating any group that comes along is a good enough reason to start broadening what the \"M\" word is applied to.\n\n \n Indeed. Neither do I think that. This is why I'm not arguing to apply it to just \"any group that comes along.\" That's not my reasoning for supporting equal marriage for same-sex couples. \n \n \nI disagree--I see no reason to think that it's not culture that defines marriage, and government sometimes... usually... reflects that over time. Every case of broadening changes in marriage demonstrates that. For example, it was the culture that changed it's view of women BEFORE marriage was considered non-patriarchal by government and law. Another example is interracial marriage, in which there's no way such change would have occurred in far more racist times--such a thing would never have even come up in the courts. And remember-- marriage existed BEFORE this government we have that you say defines marriage. The government certainly doesn't define MY marriage; I'd hate to think THAT was the case. I'd be MARRIED with or without the government saying so. It's a very foreign thing to me for anyone to hinge so much on what the government says their union is--some even wait to tie the knot ONLY after a given state recognizes it! Perhaps this is just a fundamental difference in the way people who hold the sanctity of marriage in high regard think. I don't see how anyone who views it as a holy matrimony--for instance--could ever describe that as being \"defined by the government\". It's sort of a cheapening thing to say. If you say it's about LOVE--which you have, by using that argument for gay marriage--then you can't now tie marriage definition to something so cold and beurocratic as a 'government.'\n\n \n And of course you just got finished saying how other groups would use government recognized civil marriage to be validated. Yet at the same time, it means nothing, eh? Yes, people are always seeking the type of validation which means nothing. Perfect reasoning there. LOL! Jason was right in his flip-flop comment about your position.\n \n For sure, government is rarely ahead of cultural changes it seems. To take a cynical view of government. However, government doesn't operate in isolation. It can be pushed by society, by courts. It works to continue and provide an official recognition of the culture, to say what it stands for. It's already doing so in terms of marriage, that will continue with equal marriage for same-sex couples.\n \n \n\"Sexual orientation\" is another one of those things people put out there, when really broken down in terms of its implications, is problematic. People use that phrase cavalierly, when in reality many people don't so neatly fit into categories like that. They're basically just using another way of saying \"hey, I'm gay, not straight\" which is a form of circular reasoning. And what is the \"orientation\" of what is referred to as a \"bi-sexual\", for instance? They aren't gay. They aren't straight. Are they both, neither, or a little or each?

It seems to me there's way more we don't know about this \"sexual orientation\" stuff than we do, and let's face it--it's a relatively newer concept in the grand scheme of things. I'm not saying it's not real, but I think it's often thrown out there too glibly. It's gotten to be a popular phrase due to the gay rights movement, no doubt.\n\n \n Yes, there are bi-sexuals too, but they are also acting on their sexual identity when they marry the one they love. The term \"sexual orientation\", has been used a certain way. It doesn't refer to paraphilias like pedophilia. We're not going to develop a perfect term here today. We can work with what we have, until perhaps a better term may or may not come along. \n \n \nBut even with that said, I'm fine with that concept in that I am in agreement to the extent that gay couples need to be given the couples' benefits just like anyone else would. It's fine! 'Equality' of benefits is ok with me, and IMO that's really the only equality issue that exists to begin with. Anything else is just wrangling over semantics. So, sure, it's only fair you should get couples' benefits by the government since you say it's just you being human. Again, that's WHY I am not opposed to civil unions.\n\n \n This is one aspect of equality for same-sex couples, but not every aspect. \"Separate but equal\" is really an anachronism.\n \n \nNo, no, no ..... uh uh. Stop the train; Katy, bar the door. I'm not going to let you get away with conflating issues here. What I'm saying I don't care about is what YOU think is evil or not. NOT what social issues are. YOU aren't the final word on whether social issues are evil or good. That has nothing to do with right-wing, left-wing, conservative, liberal, or whatever. the point is that you--JAKECJB--don't get to decide which position is evil or not.

That's not \"re-examining\" that I'm talking about. Re-examining is always fine. But I suspect what you REALLY mean by \"re-examine\" is \"[i]take my moralistic view as the one everybody should adopt[i].\" Nothing wrong with arguing for your version of what's moral or not, but don't call it something it's not. Don't portray it in watered-down terms like you want people to \"re-examine\" things or 'things are more complex'. No, you have a view you want the world to be, just like everyone else does, including the \"right-wing\" (as you say). You just think your way is RIGHT, just like THEY do. You don't get to start with your position being more valid. That's something you have to convince society of, just like they do. That's what the marketplace of discourse is all about.\n\n \n I agree with some of that. In so much as I don't get to dictate and start off from the position that my position is correct. I don't believe I've done this. I believe I have used arguments for my position. \"Re-examining\", as I said, of course, is how we get to the change in position which may be necessary depending on those arguments.\n \n \nSure, there may be. Like I said, anything is always up for re-examining. What you really want is for everyone to take YOUR view, so call it what it is. No one's opposed to re-examining things, and that's not the issue. What the heck; people might as well say YOU need to re-examine things, if that's going to be the approach taken. \n\n \n By all means. People are free to use logical arguments to get me to change my view.\n \n \nNo, I've told you over and over now, I'm for you getting the same couples' benefits. At this point you're just arguing over semantics. You're arguing over mode rather than substance.\n\n \n No, because I'm not just talking about the tangible, or the dollars and cents benefits. Equality represents more than this, as the courts have indicated in their interpretation of law. Extending equal marriage does have a positive social effect for same-sex couples. Again I can go back to your comment about how it provides \"validation\", as the fact you recognize this reality as well!\n \n \nI don't care whether or not \"it's bad\", or not. I'm not telling you how to live your life. That's up to you. Knock yourself out; do what you want! I have NOT told you \"you can't do that.\" Nor will I, because it's none of my business. You're barking up the wrong tree here, frankly.\n\n \n If you don't give a flying fig, why are you fighting gay marriage? If it means nothing--oh wait meaningless yet provides \"validation\"---uh....so darn confusing.\n \n \nYou made an issue of this being about you just being human; that wasn't me, it was you. If that's not an argument about something being natural, I don't know what is.\n\n \n There seems to be more that unites us as gay or straight communities than divides us. At least, it could be that way, including when it comes to equal marriage.\n \n \nFine, so we shouldn't \"exclude\" them. I certainly have no problem with that.\n\n \n Not from marriage either.\n \n \nMmm, no, when you adamantly oppose this religious view about homosexual relations, then you ARE saying you want to stop religion, at least some of it. People holding to these doctrinal views IS religion, and so when you say they can't do that, then you you're basically saying you want religion suppressed. When what you want done away with IS a part of religion, then you're basically saying you to stop at least THAT part of religion. Look, again, stop trying to sugar coat these things. Call your spade a spade.\n\n \n If gay exclusion is the foundational pillar, that religion, or that non-religious doctrine, should collapse and die. Otherwise, bring in reforms to some elements where this is justified. Here it would be the gay exclusionary elements. There are many options. Yes, you could say I want religion \"suppressed\", or I will openly and unapologetically say I am taking strong issue with religion on one basis. Sometimes religion gets a special type of respect, which it does not deserve. \n \n \nYou said it was how they express who they are as humans. That's what YOU said. If you're now saying it's not so fundamental, then great. I'm glad to hear that.\n\n \n As humans in terms of sexual identity. Sexual identity is very important, however it does not represent every fundamental aspect of the human. But it's one of those.",

I don't know who or what would come along wanting to be included, nor am I saying I do. I'm saying you're essentially wanting to change marriage to where it's an institution that would ALLOW that, on a fundamental level. To say \"I want marriage to be broadened to include MY union\" when your union doesn't fit the definition is to say you want marriage to be a broadenable institution to begin with. Surely you understand that.\n \n \nFor sure, government is rarely ahead of cultural changes it seems. To take a cynical view of government. However, government doesn't operate in isolation. It can be pushed by society, by courts. It works to continue and provide an official recognition of the culture, to say what it stands for.

I'm glad you're seeing society at least plays a role.\n \n \nBy all means. People are free to use logical arguments to get me to change my view.\n\n \n Great, as long as you are really open to being persuaded. Honestly I don't think you are; I think your use of \"logical arguments\" in this case is sort of like when people say vague things like \"reasons should be compelling\" or \"rational\". When people say things like that, my experience is that it's often a dead giveaway that REALLY means \"I'm giving myself an out so that anything you say I can claim doesn't measure up.\" It's a way for you to seemingly dismiss any argument you don't like by just labeling it as \"illogical.\" It gives you an out, so to speak. Perhaps you could let people know what would suffice to you as being a persuadable, logical argument. If it's TRULY a logical thing you are looking for, then it should be no problem for you to lay down the terms of what would suffice, after all. :)\n \n \nNo, because I'm not just talking about the tangible, or the dollars and cents benefits.\n \n \n Anything else isn't substantive. It's not quantifiable. But more importantly, the fact these benefits are some 'vapor' ('validation' or whatever it is) is all the more reason we have no business going through all the trouble of changing things. Sorry, but just giving you a feeling of validation isn't worth it. Nor is it the role of the government in the first place to make you feel good.\n \n \nIf you don't give a flying fig, why are you fighting gay marriage?\n\n \n Because gay marriage as the political ISSUE that it is has nothing to do with what you do--it has to do with what the government does (for the legal benefits aspects) or what the rest of society does (for the cultural aspect). I don't care if YOU get married--YOU can call your union whatever the heck you want ... why should I care? That's your business. Call it 'getting married', call it 'having a partner', call it 'shacking up', call it 'holy matrimony', call it anything you want. But don't tell everyone else they have to call it a certain thing either.\n \n \nIf gay exclusion is the foundational pillar, that religion, or that non-religious doctrine, should collapse and die. Otherwise, bring in reforms to some elements where this is justified.\n\n \n No, you still aren't getting it because yo have it exactly backwards here .... it's not that gay exclusion is a foundation of religion; it's that religion happens to be a foundation for what you call gay exclusion.",

   "No. If you don't know what my position is by now, then you aren't reading my posts or have a reading comprehension problem. I've told you multiple times now what my position is on gay marriage and all the other gay rights issues. And I've certainly justified my position; it's just you're never going to say my position on whether or not the govt. should bother with extending the \"M\" word to gays is justified because you don't like the position. You've pre-decided no argument will ever suffice as justification to you.\n\n \n How have you justified your position? You haven't. Is this an issue of what the government should \"bother\" to do. You've made that point before and it makes no sense. It's more of a bother to set up and maintain a totally separate institution.\n \n \nNo one is telling anyone they \"aren't good enough to be included\" in anything here. That's like saying the Jewish admonition against pork is just telling people 'they aren't good enough for pork.' This has nothing to do with whether anyone is \"good enough\" or not, for anything--you clearly have a fundamentally flawed understanding of the way religious morality works. (or are intentionally acting like you don't understand it.)\n\n \n There are negative social effects to gay exclusion. These have been documented. We need to stamp it out, where ever it raises its ugly head. Social prejudice in one area, will lead to it in another area, and will not be the best outcome for society, or for the person suffering it. It's funny, I haven't seen any studies showing how Jewish people are killing themselves because they can't eat pork, or the Amish because they can't drive a motorcar! I don't think they suffer the same type of rejection, and suffer the same negative affects, as compared to homophobic discrimination. We're obviously talking about something much more deeply personal, when it comes to sexual orientation, and the effects of rejection and exclusion wound much more deeply. The religions which don't see this, or refuse to see it, are stupid or lack empathy, or both.\n \n This exclusion from the institution of marriage speaks to the lack of respect for gay relationships. Like I said, this is the only way gay people have sexual love. It's more fundamental to the human person, than eating a certain type of animal flesh. The evidence to negative social consequences of homophobic discrimination are there. I'm not saying it would lead to suicide, but why not give gay relationships the same respect, like heterosexuals take for granted? Why give any credence at all to the notion that our relationships are not equal to heterosexual ones? \n \n \nIt doesn't matter--it's still a way that we restrict marriage for no logical reason. \"Logical reasons\" are the conditions you've set, and I've given you another example of how society does that, and therefore shown you we don't just open up marriage by default. it doesn't work that way.\n\n \n Well, your only reason is a diversion fallacy. If the sole reason we had for not allowing marriage type A, is that it would lead into a slippery slope fallacy and let in marriage Q, R, and Z, and the rest of the alpahbet too, that's just a sign of desperation. There is no argument concerning marriage type A.\n \n \nBut that's really what it amounts to. The issue becomes whether or not marriage is going to be a 'broadenable' institution in the first place, not just gay marriage.\n\n \n Yes, but broadenable doesn't mean broadenable to everything. If I say I am going to share my chocolate bar with Mary, it doesn't mean I can't share it with Mary unless I share it with the entire neighourhood. I'm still sharing, but with Mary. We're broadening, to include gays. \n \n \nYes, the very point I was making to YOU is society--YOU'RE the one who said government defines marriage (as opposed to society), remember? I'm glad you're seeing society at least plays a role.\n\n \n I think I said government played a role, not as opposed to society. Government is part of the society.\n \n \nGreat, as long as you are really open to being persuaded.

Perhaps you could let people know what would suffice to you as being a persuadable, logical argument. If it's TRULY a logical thing you are looking for, then it should be no problem for you to lay down the terms of what would suffice, after all. :)\n\n \n You can start by coming up with something that is not a false dilemma or slippery slope fallacy, or a faulty analogy. I have explained why your points equal these things. \n \n \nAnything else isn't substantive. It's not quantifiable. But more importantly, the fact these benefits are some 'vapor' ('validation' or whatever it is) is all the more reason we have no business going through all the trouble of changing things. Sorry, but just giving you a feeling of validation isn't worth it. Nor is it the role of the government in the first place to make you feel good.\n\n \n Sorry, you're wrong, the courts have found that equality is equal benefits and equal recognition. Government(civil) marriage certainly validates heterosexual, different-sex couples, and makes them feel good. That's why they do it. The more intangible benefits are part of the equation of marriage. Yes those of us who are gay are worth it too, we also are worth the whole ball of wax! \n \n Again, there you go with the argument that it's just so darn much trouble, like we as a society will be so much more tuckered out, if we make marriage gender neutral, as opposed to setting up a whole other instutution, with additional special beurocrats just to service this other institution, and a few different unneccessary laws, and future court challenges because separate but equal doesn't stand up in the long run. It's a great way to grow the size of government, just to maintain discrimination. I'm not buying this argument, that gay couples entering marriage would be just soooo much more trouble, and this is your real concern. Is anyone else?\n \n \nBecause gay marriage as the political ISSUE that it is has nothing to do with what you do--it has to do with what the government does (for the legal benefits aspects) or what the rest of society does (for the cultural aspect). I don't care if YOU get married--YOU can call your union whatever the heck you want ... why should I care? That's your business. Call it 'getting married', call it 'having a partner', call it 'shacking up', call it 'holy matrimony', call it anything you want. But don't tell everyone else they have to call it a certain thing either.\n\n \n I'm saying the law and the government should not be in the business of discrimination.\n \n \nNo, you still aren't getting it because yo have it exactly backwards here .... it's not that gay exclusion is a foundation of religion; it's that religion happens to be a foundation for what you call gay exclusion.\n\n \n I don't care. It's wrong. Whether the homophobic exclusion is religion-based or not.",

   "This person seems to echo my thoughts. Honestly, I didn't read it before my last reply--\n \n \nAudio: We are offended. PERSONALLY.\n In this audio snippet from a recent California marriage panel, you'll hear the voices of Skyline Church's Dr. Jim Garlow, conservative personality Dr. Jennifer Roback Morse, and Focus on the Family's Glenn Stanton. Marvel in just how little they realize (or admit) how intrinsically personal their gay-exclusive actions really are: \n \n \n (If embedded audio doesn't load for you, you can listen to it here) \n \n Okay, first off: We aren't TRYING to turn anything in this \"culture war\" into anything. Gay people's response to having our rights hijacked is not something that we have coordinated in board rooms. The messaging for certain campaigns, maybe. But the pain, the frustration, the deeply personal hurt -- that is organic. We accuse the other side of hurting our personal lives because they are -- wait for it, wait for it -- HURTING OUR PERSONAL LIVES. Realistically. Tangibly. Demonstrably. The hurt is both authentic and gut-wrenching. \n \n As for the veganism argument? Well of course it is easier to disconnect that debate from one's sense of personal self because it is a dietary choice, not an orientation. In fact, in terms of links between veganism and anti-gay sentiment, it would be a more accurate parallel to compare gay people with the cow! After all, since both the animal protection and the pro-gay arguments revolve around cruelty towards living things, those who are being subjected to the cruelty are the ones who can't help but feel personally slighted! \n \n And lastly -- it is complete and utter B.S. to act as if the LGBT community is packed to the gills with people who are opposed to marriage equality. There are of course some, just like there are some devout evangelicals who are in favor of gay rights. But to suggest that there are \"a number of\" anti-marriage equality gays traipsing through this nation is as much of a red herring as saying opposing gay civil equality shouldn't make a gay person feel personally slighted. Both ideas overlook actuality in favor of advantageous rhetoric. \n \n But we do get why these kids feel the need to take this off a personal playing field. After all, human beings do have to sleep at night.\n\n \n Audio: We are offended. PERSONALLY. - Good As You:: Gay and Lesbian Activism With a Sense of Humor",

   "(shrug) I could say the same about you!\n\n On what issue?\n Cause for you, it's specifically this issue where you claim to \"support\" gay rights, but any effort to achieve gay equality is condemned by you...\n \n \n \nYou misunderstand what I'm saying here. It's only because society finally changed enough to decide gay marriage is even valid to some that it's even viewed as a form of ILLEGITIMATE discrimination to begin with.\n \n It's only because society decided racial issues were bad enough that it became an issue enough for someone to even bring it forward in the courts.\n\n Just because a discrimination is \"bad enough\" is not the reason why it gets decided as \"illegitimate\" in the courts.\n Take the Lemon Test for example. Nowhere does it specify that the discrimination has to be \"bad enough\".\n \n If we had a case where just one guy was discriminated against cause he was in a wheel chair, it shouldn't hurt his case just cause he doesn't have 20,000 other handicapped people who are in a similar situation.\n \n \n \nIt wouldn't have happened AT ALL if society hadn't changed siginificantly on this. Can you imagine an interracial marriage case winning (or even being brought to trial) in the 19th century?? In the late 1860s? Or really even in the Jim Crow era?\n\n The reasons are that society evolved.\n \"Bad enough\" may have been a factor in causing a distinct speed in society evolving, but it's not a requirement.\n \n It's not like the courts looked at the case and said \"You know what? There is enough *bad enough* history here whereby its time to allow interracial marriage\".\n Society evolving? YES.\n But as for society's opinion being required before a discrimination can be legally recognized as \"illegitimate\"? No.\n \n \n \nThat process is going on with gay marriage, though whether or not society will ultimately come to same sort of conclusions remains to be seen. Your analogy of interracial marriage is valid from the standpoint that it's a form of marriage that is begin decided on by society in terms of whether or not the 'discrimination' is illegitimate. But that's where the analogy ends--it doesn't apply in terms of racism and is too different in terms of religion and moralistic values.\n\n I really wish you would review history before presuming to declare things one way or another.\n Do you even know what the reasons were for supporting interracial marriage?\n Do you even know what the state tried to argue were the \"legitimate state interests\" in supporting miscegenation laws?\n \n The interracial marriage laws WERE approached by BOTH \"religion and moralistic\" values.\n \n \n \nHuh?? I don't really get this analogy. The bottom line I think is that society is determining how it wants to define marriage. Whether or not it's a broaden-able institution.\n\n I keep talking about the GOVERNMENTAL definition.\n You keep talking about \"societal\".\n They are NOT the same thing.\n Just because the government allows gay marriage does not mean society's definition \"has\" to change.\n \n I keep showing reasons why the government cannot discriminate against gay marriage, and you keep trying to change the subject.\n Whether or not \"society\" agrees is only important if society decides to enact an amendment.\n \n \n \nFoundit, the whole idea that it's illegitimate discrimination is begging the question. THAT'S what society is trying to decide.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n And there you go again.\n It IS NOT society's decision as to whether or not it is a \"legitimate\" form of discrimination.\n In 1967, society believed, by a margin of 3 to 1, that interracial marriage was illegitimate. Discrimination was desired.\n \n But the COURTS RECOGNIZED that the basis for claiming that were illegitimate.\n Again, you keep trying to substitute \"society\" wherever the issue is TRULY SOMETHING ELSE, and then ignore the difference...\n \n \n \nI agree it's illegitimate, and that's why I think gays should have couples' benefits too. But it's still something society has to ultimately decide.\n\n I don't recall society ever getting to vote on anybody else's marriage.\n Brittany Spears did something monumentally stupid in Las Vegas, but nobody contests her right to be stupid in marriage.\n \n Society was NOT the one to \"ultimately decide\" whether the \"Loving\" couple could get married.\n WHY do you keep pretending otherwise?\n \n \n \nNot on the order that homosexuality-related issues is.\n\n You are rewriting history based on your current perspective.\n Segregation and racism were moral philosophies, embraced whole-heartedly in the church, justified in biblical interpretations.\n \n Are you judging another person's religious interpretations and declaring them as inferior to your own?\n \n \n \nYou're viewing history by attributing religion more than it really was. Religion was more often the excuse--the justification given. Racism was the problem.\n\n And you think prejudice against gays doesn't stretch WAYYYY beyond religion?\n I don't think you do, but getting you to admit it is another matter.\n \n The bible doesn't declare gays shouldn't be able to adopt.\n The bible doesn't declare gays can't serve in the military.\n \n Religion IS STILL the excuse. That's one of the \"great\" things about having a moral judgment system where you follow a doctrine without employing real logical assessment.\n \n \n \nIn the case of homosexuality matters, religion REALLY IS what's behind a lot of the opposition. There may be prejudice TOO, but that doesn't mean religion isn't a lot of what's behind it.\n\n Gee. Am I the guy who argues that religion is not behind the anti-gay prejudice...\n Hmm. No. I think I'm one of the guys who has been arguing that religion has been THE major factor behind the anti-gay discrimination.\n \n And it's not an issue of \"there may be prejudice too\". When it comes to saying that gays should not be able to adopt, should not serve in the military, should not have the same rights as married couples...\n That IS PREJUDICE.\n \n The bible justifies none of that. Christians can handle working alongside people who violate the first commandment or the second commandment or the third commandment or the fourth commandment ...\n But when it comes to working alongside a gay person, the prejudice FIGHTS cause they insist that they have to be able to fire the gays...\n Anything less is supposedly a violation of their religion...\n But WHERE IS THAT WRITTEN in their religion???\n \n Religion is still just an excuse.\n \n \n \nSo, Christians should never take any stand on social moralistic issues, ever, since there will always be stuff in their own life that they need to contend with? Christians should never oppose anything?\n\n Wow.\n So you seem to think that NOT JUDGING OTHER PEOPLE is somehow the same thing as fighting for CIVIL RIGHTS EQUALITY.\n That is bizarre to me, cause I see them as two ENTIRELY different things.\n \n People didn't fight for black civil rights because they wanted to judge racists.\n They did it because they wanted to help blacks to have the same rights as whites had.\n \n One of these days it would be nice if you STOPPED AND THOUGHT about how ridiculous your attempt to equate two things were in your attempt to pretend I said something I clearly did not...\n \n \n \nYes, yes, I know you try to distinguish between those two when it's convenient. (then conflate them when you need to as well.)\n\n Can you provide a link where I supposedly did that?\n Naw. Didn't think so...\n These falsehoods grow boring...\n \n \n \nSo then you think they should just be restricted from working toward policy and legislation. No, that's not right either.\n\n You're right!\n Your claimed assessment of my position is \"not right\".\n I have obviously REPEATEDLY shown a difference inbetween CHURCH action, and individuals who happen to go to a church acting.\n \n It would really help if you could remember that, instead of repeatedly trying to obfuscate the issue.\n It's rather absurd for me to have to keep telling you what my ACTUAL position is, over and over and over again...\n But then you keep having difficulty remembering it...\n \n \n \nMm hmm. emoticon_xdonno And I guess you're his agent of making sure it's not popular now\n\n Nope. I'm not \"his agent\" for anything.\n I'm just pointing out cause and effect. If you truly cared about following his word, these things would cause you to pause and question your actions.\n The key words being \"If you truly cared...\".\n \n \n \n huh? emoticon_rolleyes The guy who keeps all those Christian honest? Foundit, you're something else.\n\n This is really funny coming from the guy who endlessly criticizes gays...\n At least I'm up front on my actual issues...\n \n \n \nSuch as? (And how they're SPECIFICALLY violated?) Let me guess, you aren't going to want to give any specifics and will avoid it. ;)\n\n I've actually opened a new thread on the Mormon violation for Prop 8.\n So, your question has been answered.\n \n Moreover, this line of questioning is just a boring waste of time.\n We could google \"Lemon Test\" and review a variety of legal ways it was applied and questioned.\n I don't know why you keep on with this pointless pretense that there isn't substance to my position, ESPECIALLY when I keep having to remind you that I support the STATUS QUO.\n \n I think maybe it's you who should be answering the questions, cause it's obviously your confusion we need to overcome in the first place.\n Do you not understand that there IS a \"separation of church and state\" that is applied in this country?\n Do you not understand that there IS a \"lemon test\" which governs some application of this standard?\n Do you not understand that there ARE standards for tax exemption of churches, whereby if they violate those standards they lose \"tax exempt\" status?\n \n THESE are the LEGAL actions I support.\n Instead of these endless and increasingly pointless questions about MY position, maybe you should start explaining what it is you don't get about the status quo???",

No. I think I'm one of the guys who has been arguing that religion has been THE major factor behind the anti-gay discrimination.\n \n And it's not an issue of \"there may be prejudice too\".\n\n \n Yes it is. You obviously don't really understand religious morality and the way it operates. You never have, as you've never really considered what I've told you on this more than once. For most Christians, other that the Phelps-sort of lunatics, they don't look at gays and think \"oh he's a gay person\". They don't even think that way. They believe gay relations are wrong because that's their religion. When it comes to blacks, people DID look at black people in a prejudiced, hateful way. You've been told this over and over, but you don't believe it--I suspect because it's easier to just throw everything in a box and label it as hate when it's often not. There IS a difference here, and though you don't really CARE, luckily you don't speak for many people out there.\n \n \nSo you seem to think that NOT JUDGING OTHER PEOPLE is somehow the same thing as fighting for CIVIL RIGHTS EQUALITY.\n That is bizarre to me, cause I see them as two ENTIRELY different things.\n\n \n No, you misunderstood again. (or else willfully acted like you didn't get it.) The point is that your standard for that is SO BROAD (given that you're pitting the 'judge not' scriptures against Christians on this issue) that it could apply to ANY SORT of case where Christians take a moral stand. They're judging ANYONE for whom they feel their actions are not right. Whether or not gay marriage is a case of \"civil rights equality\" begs the question. YOU don't get to decide that's an example of being unChristian, to begin with, or that it's serious enough to warrant such.\n \n \nOne of these days it would be nice if you STOPPED AND THOUGHT about ...\n\n \n You know Foundit, these tactics of yours don't get you anywhere. When you can't refute something, you throw out a garbage question of \"do you know we have church and state in this country\". When confronted with a different viewpoint that you don't like, you throw out this garbage statement about someone needing to \"STOP and THINK.\" No, YOU need to stop and think about a POV other than yours for once. \n \n \nYou're right!\n Your claimed assessment of my position is \"not right\".\n I have obviously REPEATEDLY shown a difference inbetween CHURCH action, and individuals who happen to go to a church acting.\n\n \n Where??? Because I'd love for you to show where you've done THAT. You have NOT shown even a smittering of difference, much less any \"obvious\" and \"repeated\" one. What you HAVE done is conflate the two in the other thread you started about the LDS Church.\n \n \nThis is really funny coming from the guy who endlessly criticizes gays...

You point to things like the Lemon test, as if you aren't OVER-APPLYING the lemon test. The lemon test isn't NEARLY as restrictive as you are Foundit, in that you aren't looking into SPECIFICS. You don't want to deal with them (for the obvious reason that you know they may undercut your case)--your statements about the Mormons in the other thread shows that clearly. Just saying junk like \"the Mormons gave money\" doesn't cut it. You're going to have to SHOW HOW they breached church and state for that to carry any weight. That's what you don't get. You aren't taking responsibility for the burden of proof you have. You don't get to use the law in vague generalities, Foundit. If you accuse someone of breaking the law, you have the burden of showing HOW that happened--show evidence. What you've done with this in both threads is like someone accusing someone else of SPEEDING, and when asked to support that accusation, doing nothing more than pointing at the speed limit sign and showing how speeding is illegal as if that's enough to convict them. Citing the law doesn't prove someone else broke it. Saying 'but look-- the Lemon test!!' doesn't show how a given action has MET the lemon test.",

Please stop.\n \n \nIt would be more accurate to state that society does not attempt to change the government's recognition.\n\n \n Surely that is another way to detect whether society accepts something. If efforts to change governmental recognition are not significant then obviously society has at least some acceptance of that something.\n \n \nHere's a simple question for you...Massachusetts? Gay marriage is legal. Does the \"society accept\" it?\n\n \n If it was done via court order then it has yet to be tested. If any efforts exist, like prop 8, and fail the vote then, yes, the people of Mass. have accepted it. If similar efforts try and fail on a national level then, yes, our society has accepted it. If it is done via court order and efforts to create propositions and initiatives such as prop 8 and prop 22 try, succeed, and are overturned by the government then, no, society has not accepted it.\n \n \nWhat you are really describing is whether or not government officials will do something mandated by the constitution. It doesn't matter whether or not the society \"has changed\".\n\n \n I'm making no value statement. I'm not saying it is good, bad or if it \"matters\" to people, only stating what is.\n \n \nThe government could realize it must set a mass murderer free because of 5th amendment violations. That doesn't mean that society \"has changed\" to like mass murder.\n\n \n I don't believe the two situations are analogous in any way. Perhaps if you clarify more.\n \n \nI disagree profoundly with this claim. The government is supposed to uhpold THE CONSTITUTION.\n \n Review the presidential oath of office: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" \n \n Does it say ANYWHERE in there that they swear to be \"an expression of the people's will\"? No. Our country was established as a \"Republic\" for specific reasons, including a recognition that sometimes the \"people's will\" isn't always what's best.\n\n \n The US Constitution is outside the scope of our discussion on the will of the majority, since amending that document is far removed from any democratic vote and so the will of the people has little or no immediate effect.\n \n However, the document itself begins \"We the People...\" a phrase has been construed as affirming that the national government created by the Constitution derives its sovereignty from the people (or society). However, the finer points of Constitutional interpretation is also beyond the scope of this discussion.\n \n \nAnd the boundaries that establish equal rights as \"not absolute\" are often explicitly stated in court documents. Like \"legitimate state interests\" help establish what is a constitutionally protected \"equal right\", and what discrimination is forbidden by the constitution.\n\n \n This doesn't have anything to do with the discussion, unless you have a point your driving at with this.\n \n \nNO. When WE talk about what the GOVERNMENT DOES AND RECOGNIZES, that is not a \"society views as legitimate\".\n\n \n foundit66, you're changing the goal posts.

   "Nope--I oppose gay marriage. I don't oppose civil unions. Why you keep on belligerently ignoring that I've told you that many times now, I don't know.\n\n I think I need an abbreviation for when you give a reply that:\n 1) Does nothing to actually refute what I said.\n 2) Does not address what I said.\n 3) Pretends to do either (or both) of the above.\n I think I'll use the term \"CLAFCLO\" to abbreviate when you pull such an instance.\n I did not say anything to contradict your position against gay marriage or for civil unions.\n In your reply, you pretend that I have said something against that, when I clearly have not.\n \n CLAFCLO.\n \n \n \nIn terms of it being all about a behavior, that's beside the point. You can't expect religious people to go along with the idea of making something they believe is immoral a completely acceptable and legitimized action when they believe it's ok to do it.\n\n Again CLAFCLO.\n I don't expect \"religious people to go along with\" anything. Nobody is asking religious people to do anything.\n It's the GOVERNMENT that is recognizing gay marriage. Not \"religious people\".\n \n By your analysis, we could say \"religious people have gone along with the idea of making atheism, which they believe is immoral, as something 'completely acceptable' and legitimized action\".\n In place of atheism, we could insert all sorts of different sins like \"swearing\", \"divorce\", \"envy\", \"working on the sabbaoth\", etc, etc, etc...\n \n The fact that people wouldn't dream of using those other phrasing only underlines the extra fixation that some Christians place on \"homosexuality\" that they do not for other sins...\n \n \n \nSure it is. Society has to be able to make decisions about itself, and set it's own standards. It's silly to say otherwise. \n\n No. It's not.\n At times, I ponder why you think saying the contrary somehow means your right, especially when you prove you don't understand the concepts involved in the first place.\n \"Society\" can make almost any arbitrary decision it wants. They can choose to associate with gays, or not associate with gays. They can choose to buy from only straight stores, or they can choose not to care.\n But the government isn't free to discriminate. And the \"legitimate state interests\" that the government recognizes are not up for arbitrary \"majority decision\".\n \n Think a little bit about the last statement. If it were true that the society could make decisions about what constitutes a \"legitimate state interest\", what good would there be in that 14th amendment concept?\n If a law came up for review on lacking \"legitimate state interest\" discrimination purpose, the people supporting the law could simply say \"Well, a majority passed the law. Ergo, society has declared it a 'legitimate state interest'.\"\n EVERY LAW WOULD PASS THAT TEST, making the test completely meaningless.\n \n Try to think about that, cause logically it is clear that even without knowing what the \"legitimate state interest\" of the state means or how it is used, it is obvious that your application is pointless. I urge you to try to learn more about the subject and stop pretending to speak about it when you clearly do not know about it ...\n \n \n \nI didn't say it was the one that decided that. I'm pointing out to you that society has to change before anything like that ultimately happens. What you call \"evolving.\" \n\n I find this line of commentary thoroughly pointless.\n Suppose we assume your claim true. One could observe that the California initiative barely passed. 52% to 48%, which demonstrates some level of \"evolution\".\n We're already there...\n \n Now if you want to claim that it has to be \"majority evolution\", then that argument is addressed elsewhere.\n If you aren't going to claim that it has to be \"majority evolution\", then I really don't see a point to your argument.\n \n \n \nAnd you think prejudice against gays doesn't stretch WAYYYY beyond religion?\n\n Again, I refer to the evidence at hand.\n As previously discussed, it has been demonstrated that it is JUST the Christian organizations that have effort devoted to multi-million dollar organizations in the U.S. with the express purpose of maligning gays.\n Example after example after example... Christian.\n \n What you're doing is like arguing for the existence of a pink zebra, when all we can see rumbling across the plains are black and white zebras...\n \n \n \nIt's the BASIS. Not the \"excuse\" for anything.\n\n You claim it's the \"basis\"?\n Prove it.\n Show me where in the bible it says that gays can't adopt.\n Show me where in the bible it says that gays can't serve in the military.\n \n \n \nWhether the Bible declares it or not is really beside the point; the Bible doesn't declare, for instance, that people shouldn't use electricity. But it's RELIGION that's the basis for Amish people to believe that, even though it's not in their Bible.\n\n Religion tells a person how THAT PERSON should act.\n When those commandments are espoused onto others, it's an excuse.\n \n \n \nYes it is.\n\n CLAFCLO.\n I am saying that it's not an issue of \"there may be prejudice too\".\n I am saying that it's an issue of \"and it IS ALSO prejudice\".\n It's not a \"may be\", but rather an \"it is\" situation.\n \n \n \nI suspect because it's easier to just throw everything in a box and label it as hate when it's often not.\n\n Again, CLAFCLO.\n How many times do I have to tell you that \"hate\", the existence or absence thereof, and all the mindless quibbling you want to make on the issue is irrelevant?\n You keep wanting to change my discussions to a pretense of \"hate\".\n Here, you obfuscate and deceive as to my actions, when I have told you repeatedly that I do NOT \"label it as hate\"...\n \n \n \nNo, you misunderstood again. (or else willfully acted like you didn't get it.) The point is that your standard for that is SO BROAD ...\n\n No. You're wrong.\n And your pretense that I am \"misunderstanding\" is funny.\n You're talking about MY POSITION.\n YOU are the one who is obviously intent in obfuscating...\n \n Wanting civil rights for others is not \"judging\" other people.\n That's not what it is about.\n \n You can't claim that your \"point (Jyoshu's) is that your (foundit66's) standard...\", and then throw something out there that I am trying to explain to you is NOT MY STANDARD.\n WHERE is there any form of intelligence in that?\n \n What you are talking about is NOT my standard, so stop trying to claim it is...\n \n Going a step further, you haven't shown that you are showing ANYBODY's REAL \"position\" on that.\n Instead, you are relying on this lame \"somebody could make an argument\" type stance whereby you refuse to address the VALIDITY of anybody trying to utilize such an approach in the first place.\n \n \n \nYou know Foundit, these tactics of yours don't get you anywhere. When you can't refute something, you throw out a garbage question of \"do you know we have church and state in this country\".\n\n That's not garbage.\n You clearly DO NOT understand some of the things you try to speak about.\n Furthermore, when people correct you, and give resources for doing so, you often refuse to recognize and correct yourself.\n \n If you want, I can explicitly point out the points in the conversation where you demonstrate you don't understand separation of church and state.\n \n \n \nWhere??? Because I'd love for you to show where you've done THAT. You have NOT shown even a smittering of difference, much less any \"obvious\" and \"repeated\" one. What you HAVE done is conflate the two in the other thread you started about the LDS Church.\n\n Actually, those two aspects HAVE NOT EVEN COME UP in that other thread, so your claim about what's going on in that other thread is obviously false.\n \n \n \nA flat-out falsehood--I've told you straight up what my views are numerous times. \n\n CLAFCLO.\n To repeat my statement: This is really funny coming from the guy who endlessly criticizes gays... At least I'm up front on my actual issues...\n What aspect is a \"falsehood\"?\n Do you really need me to provide historical proof of you criticizing gays?\n And as for the not being \"up front\", the proof of that spans MULTIPLE MESSAGE BOARDS, so I really don't think you want to get into your deceit on that...\n \n Cause in the big picture, I'll prove my point to others while you will whine and cry about things that other people already know is true...\n \n \n \nWhat?? you mean actually try to SHOW how your accusation fits? Imagine that. emoticon_rolleyes I'd LOVE for you to show EXACTLY how what Mormons did (for instance) meeting the lemon test. We both know you won't, 'cause you can't. And if you think all this stuff is so boring (the 2nd time you've used that tactic-of-a-term), one can't help but wonder why you're harping on it. \n\n 1) It's your responses that are boring cause they use the same lame tactics time and time again.\n Tactics that \"don't get you anywhere\", but you do them anyways...\n 2) I am leaving the Mormon / Prop 8 discussion on THAT thread. You just tried to pull this really lame stunt of demanding I give proof of something we weren't even talking about (mormons and lemon test) when what we WERE talking about was substantiation of the lemon test.\n 3) And regarding what I ACTUALLY said, it was simply this: \"We could google \"Lemon Test\" and review a variety of legal ways it was applied and questioned.\"\n \n For the life of me, I don't understand your response cause it's insane!\n Are you doubting that the \"Lemon Test\" has examples?\n Are you going to try to refute that my opinion is supporting the Lemon Test in these examples?\n \n Your reply is nonsensical. You asked for a demonstration of my opinion, and I am giving you it.\n Lemon v. Kurtzman - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n See? I've given you examples.\n \n \n \nYeah, you say you support them, but your standard of what constitutes such things is obviously so ridiculously over-the-top, it's laughable.\n\n Is this where you try this strawman stunt of telling me what my opinion is, even though I say it is not that???\n Just a prediction...\n Let's proceed...\n \n \n \nYou point to things like the Lemon test, as if you aren't OVER-APPLYING the lemon test.\n\n Give me an example WHERE I APPLIED the Lemon Test, where I was guilty of over-applying it...\n Oooh. Let me guess. You can't do it.\n It's another CLAFCLO, isn't it...\n \n \n \nThe lemon test isn't NEARLY as restrictive as you are Foundit, in that you aren't looking into SPECIFICS.\n\n Not only is the Lemon Test NOT the only standard out there (like tax exempt status), but it is NOT the only standard I apply.\n I never claimed it was the only standard I apply.\n \n \n \nYou don't want to deal with them (for the obvious reason that you know they may undercut your case)--your statements about the Mormons in the other thread shows that clearly.\n\n Quote me...\n \n \n \nJust saying junk like \"the Mormons gave money\" doesn't cut it. You're going to have to SHOW HOW they breached church and state for that to carry any weight. That's what you don't get. You aren't taking responsibility for the burden of proof you have.\n\n And again, CLAFCLO.\n I never even mentioned \"Mormons\" in this thread. I just EXPLICITLY gave the standards I hold to. Separation of Church and State. Tax Exempt. Lemon Test.\n If you want to move the goal posts and talk about \"The Mormons\", they violated \"Tax Exempt\" in the church campaign fund-raising. They violate the \"Lemon Test\" in the first portion where there is no legitimate state interest for the legislation.\n \n \n \nYou don't get to use the law in vague generalities, Foundit.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n I AM NOT THE ONE USING THE LAW...\n Let me say that again...\n I AM NOT THE ONE USING THE LAW...\n I am simply AGREEING with the EXISTING APPLICATIONS of the EXISTING law.\n \n Can you do us all a favor and STOP and THINK.\n Are you saying that the EXISTING law (tax exempt, lemon law, violation of separation of church and state) are being used in \"vague generalities\"?\n Are you saying that when these court cases go to trial, the people who are claiming violation get up and give vague arguments with no specifics?\n I have been trying to keep this simple for you, but you insist on trying to muddy it up.\n \n My examples, are EXISTING LEGAL COURT CASE PRECEDENT cases...\n I am baffled by your insistence that I give my opinion, which I did...\n Then you insist on EXAMPLES of my opinion, and they are there for everybody to see in EXISTING COURT CASES...\n And you REFUSE TO RECOGNIZE THAT...\n \n It would be like me trying to hound you for proof of the existence of Christians...\n \n \n \nIf you accuse someone of breaking the law, you have the burden of showing HOW that happened--show evidence.\n\n Show me a place where I \"accused someone of breaking the law\", and we'll discuss that there.\n We are already doing that in the Mormon thread, but evidently you aren't recognizing that...\n \n \n \nWhat you've done with this in both threads is like someone accusing someone else of SPEEDING, and when asked to support that accusation, doing nothing more than pointing at the speed limit sign and showing how speeding is illegal as if that's enough to convict them.\n\n Once again, you've moved the goal-posts.\n This discussion started with you asking my opinion on what restrictions should be made on religion.\n I gave it.\n You started claiming that I didn't have those standards, but you offer no evidence of your claim.\n You asked for examples of my position for elaboration, and I simply point you to the EXISTING COURT CASES so you can understand EXACTLY what my position is for elaboration...\n \n And then you come along and all of a sudden start talking about \"accusations\"?\n Once again, take up my accusations WHEN THEY ARE MADE...\n The Mormon is a perfect example, but you're trying to mix the two threads together and you are now trying to confuse the point of the original request.",

   "I'm sorry, perhaps I wasn't clear. What, specifically, are you citing. A court case? A proposition? An opinion poll?\n\n Opinion poll, taken at the time of Loving v Virginia.\n Not only that, but many opinion polls after that. Society did not achieve \"majority\" until late 1980's/early 1990's.\n \n \n \nStop being hostile, foundit66. If you think anything I say is pointless then ask to stop the discussion. Otherwise you are simply being insulting. Please stop.\n\n You presume insult too much.\n Substitute \"arbitrary\" or whatever you feel necessary for it to sound less insulting, but I am interested in your definition.\n How do you define \"accept\"?\n I am asking because I am interested in understanding further, and simply explaining why I want to know. I don't think a conversation can go any further without an explanation, because I don't see a point in the current terminology.\n \n \n \nSurely that is another way to detect whether society accepts something. If efforts to change governmental recognition are not significant then obviously society has at least some acceptance of that something.\n\n And part of the problem I have with your definition of \"acceptance\" is that I don't agree with what you just said.\n A society can show \"non-acceptance\" in a variety of ways that have nothing to do with governmental change or attempted governmental change.\n Churches can preach \"the only real marriage is heterosexual marriage\", and all the parishioners can follow that mentality. Gay marriage can be legally performed by the government, but society may deem not to \"accept\" it by social convention. Societal (non-governmental) organizations can have a \"married couples cookout\" event, and then not invite any gay married couples to attend.\n Society is about more than just whether or not the government recognizes something as legal.\n \n \n \nIf it was done via court order then it has yet to be tested. If any efforts exist, like prop 8, and fail the vote then, yes, the people of Mass. have accepted it. If similar efforts try and fail on a national level then, yes, our society has accepted it. If it is done via court order and efforts to create propositions and initiatives such as prop 8 and prop 22 try, succeed, and are overturned by the government then, no, society has not accepted it.\n\n So the ultimate example of \"accepting\" is to either not attempt, or attempt and fail at changing the government?\n To me, this makes \"acceptance\" just an extension of governmental status, which borders on a dangerous supposition, IMO. Thinking that society is just an extension of government appears akin to an Orwellian mindset.\n \n \n \nI'm making no value statement. I'm not saying it is good, bad or if it \"matters\" to people, only stating what is.\n\n My statement was not a value statement either. Just a classification based on circumstances.\n \n \n \nI don't believe the two situations are analogous in any way. Perhaps if you clarify more.\n\n Part of the problem is that I don't have a good explanation on what your status of \"acceptance\" is, so I've been working off of functional interpretation.\n Your \"acceptance\" seems to be a derivative of the people either:\n a) not attempting to change a situation, or \n b) attempting to change a situation, and failing.\n \n In the case of the mass murderer, society is at the stage of one or the other. Either they have not attempted to change the release of the mass murderer, or they might try to change the situation and not succeeded.\n In either case, interpreting your responses functionally, you are defining \"societal acceptance\" based on situational conclusion.\n \n \n \nThe US Constitution is outside the scope of our discussion on the will of the majority, since amending that document is far removed from any democratic vote and so the will of the people has little or no immediate effect.\n\n The title of this thread regards \"civil rights\", so the constitution is INHERENTLY INVOLVED in the scope of this discussion.\n You responded to ME and MY statements, and what I was discussing.\n So no. The U.S. constitution is not outside the scope of our discussion.\n You are trying to change the actual point of this thread.\n I would think it more relevant for you to start a new thread that deals specifically with society, so as to avoid entanglement with the separate issue of \"government\".\n Cause you see, a society can still \"disapprove\" of gay marriage even if it's legal. For over 20 years after Loving v Virginia, society did not like interracial marriage.\n \n \n \nHowever, the document itself begins \"We the People...\" a phrase has been construed as affirming that the national government created by the Constitution derives its sovereignty from the people (or society). However, the finer points of Constitutional interpretation is also beyond the scope of this discussion.\n\n It does begin \"We the people...\", but let's look at what it does say, more completely...\n We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\n The constitution is not just a way for the general population to pass laws.\n It does a lot more than just that...\n \n \n \nThis doesn't have anything to do with the discussion, unless you have a point your driving at with this.\n\n The topic is \"Why has opposing gay civil rights become such an issue?\".\n As such, the civil rights status is entirely topical.\n People opposing gay civil rights are doing so by explicitly avoiding current segments of our existing constitution. Segments on equality. Freedom.\n Amending the constitution would demonstrate an implicit admission that the constitution which says one thing, is desired by the people to say another.\n \n All these things are relevant.\n \n \n \nfoundit66, you're changing the goal posts. The point of what we are discussing is what society accepts, not what government allows.\n\n Considering I don't understand how you define \"society accepts\", I don't see how it ties into the topic.\n As explained above, I am not moving any goal posts.\n My comments are directly topical.\n \n \n \nAs the passage of these bans show, society does not appear ready to accept gay marriage. This does not really affect what the government will do or recognizes except to the extent that the people make their will known through initiatives and propositions.\n\n I \"don't accept\" the Christian dogma that homosexuality is a sin. I find it to be based on nothing more than pure prejudice and has no divine inspiration. I think the biblical establishment of homosexuality as a \"sin\" has as much merit as the bible passages which put women as second class citizens, or state that people should not eat pork or shellfish.\n \n I \"don't accept\" the Christian dogma that homosexuality is a sin.\n But at the same time, I acknowledge freedom of religion and freedom of people to believe what they want in their private lives and the freedom of people to hold themselves up to whatever standards they personally deem fit.\n (subject to a variety of minor existing legal restrictions)\n \n What you describe as \"acceptance\" and \"the people makes their will known\" essentially boils down to what the people will do to prevent something. That goes well and beyond simple \"not accepting\". I see it as dangerous to talk about \"acceptance\" being evaluated based on governmental enaction of discrimination.",

You've been told already that the methods of dealing with different issues are different methods. Just because some methods are more public than others doesn't mean there's an \"extra fixation.\" I think it's natural for people to think that people are out to get them on the issue THEY think is more important, and therefore don't really SEE the other issues because they aren't looking for them. You aren't really LOOKING for the divorce issue, so all you mostly see is the issue that happens to be higher up on your list in terms of what's important. Christians deal with the issue of divorce and other things too, just in different ways--this has already been refuted and I've explained it to you already.\n \n But you're going to argue this in the ground, even though NO ONE has argued that and you've made it clear you aren't going to accept reality on that. A simple \"you know, Christians DO deal with divorce too\" would do so much to show me that you're really even taking this seriously.\n \n \nAt times, I ponder why you think saying the contrary somehow means your right, especially when you prove you don't understand the concepts involved in the first place.\n \"Society\" can make almost any arbitrary decision it wants. They can choose to associate with gays, or not associate with gays. They can choose to buy from only straight stores, or they can choose not to care.\n But the government isn't free to discriminate. And the \"legitimate state interests\" that the government recognizes are not up for arbitrary \"majority decision\".\n\n \n CLAFCLO. \n \n I have not said government and society were not two separate entities. But one influences the other and that's what you don't seem to want to acknowledge. Again, government would NEVER have made interracial marriage legal if society hadn't evolved, and therefore the issue made it through SOME extent of the court of public opinion.\n \n \nThink a little bit about the last statement. If it were true that the society could make decisions about what constitutes a \"legitimate state interest\", what good would there be in that 14th amendment concept?\n\n \n Then what and who determines what constitutes legitimate state interests? YOU? No thanks. If society can't determine that on it's own, then it's a sad situation indeed for all.\n \n \nI urge you to try to learn more about the subject and stop pretending to speak about it when you clearly do not know about it ...\n\n \n Foundit, for whatever reason, you are really in a foul mood. Look in the mirror if you want to see someone who doesn't understand the issue, and stop childishly throwing out the \"you just don't understand it\" junk. Because that IS what you're doing. Stop the tactics, because I understand it just fine. YOU'RE not the arbiter or who understands them and who doesn't anyway. You've given NO reason here to think you're any sort of expert on these issues.\n \n \nNow if you want to claim that it has to be \"majority evolution\", then that argument is addressed elsewhere.\n If you aren't going to claim that it has to be \"majority evolution\", then I really don't see a point to your argument.\n\n \n CLAFCLO again. \n \n I said NOTHING about a \"majority\" evolution. What thread are you even reading? I have NOT said the evolution I'm talking about needs to be mor than half the people in society coming to that conclusion. Obviously that'sn not the case, as it was still a minority that supported interracial marriage when it was made legal.\n \n \nAgain, I refer to the evidence at hand.\n As previously discussed, it has been demonstrated that it is JUST the Christian organizations that have effort devoted to multi-million dollar organizations in the U.S. with the express purpose of maligning gays.\n Example after example after example... Christian.\n\n \n No, it has not. You've not demonstrated such evidence that it's only \"organizations\" at all!\n \n \nYou claim it's the \"basis\"?\n Prove it.\n Show me where in the bible it says that gays can't adopt.\n Show me where in the bible it says that gays can't serve in the military.\n\n \n Nope, it doesn't have to be in the BIBLE for it to be a basis. Again, it's not in the Bible for Amish to not use electricity, but it's something they take seriously. No one ever said it had to be in the Bible for it to be a religious basis.\n \n \nI am saying that it's not an issue of \"there may be prejudice too\".\n I am saying that it's an issue of \"and it IS ALSO prejudice\".\n It's not a \"may be\", but rather an \"it is\" situation.\n\n \n I know that's what you're SAYING. You just haven't proven it. It's frankly a stupid discussion that is two different ways of saying the same thing for all practical purposes, so why you're making such a stink about it is anyone's guess.\n \n \n\n Wanting civil rights for others is not \"judging\" other people.\n That's not what it is about.\n\n \n Again, CLAFCLO.\n \n The issue of whether or not gay marriage is \"civil rights\" or not is begging the question. You're jumping to the premise that society is trying to come to the determination of.\n \n \nTo repeat my statement: This is really funny coming from the guy who endlessly criticizes gays... At least I'm up front on my actual issues...\n What aspect is a \"falsehood\"?\n Do you really need me to provide historical proof of you criticizing gays?\n And as for the not being \"up front\", the proof of that spans MULTIPLE MESSAGE BOARDS, so I really don't think you want to get into your deceit on that...\n\n \n Foundit, drop the egomaniac attempts at intimidation and personal attacks. They aren't going to work with me. You know what the issues being discussed here are, and it's really not too much to ask you to stick to them, instead of choosing to pull this junk. Given what you just said, your consistent penchant for brow-beating and yelling at people (the all-caps thing you do so much--something you should know is considered yelling in an online venue), and that multiple posters now have called you on the goalpost changing that you do regularly, it's frankly ironic that anyone would consider you a \"moderator\" on any message board (though thank goodness, not this one). \n \n \nYour reply is nonsensical. You asked for a demonstration of my opinion, and I am giving you it.\n Lemon v. Kurtzman - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n See? I've given you examples.\n\n \n Um ... do you really think a couple of Wikipedia links demonstrates your opinion? I'm afraid you're going to have to do better than that--like, some actual discussion and making your case. LOL, everyone knows what the lemon test is, Foundit. People know about the case you linked to too. You need to show HOW it demostrates what YOUR arguing. Who do you really think you're fooling here, at this point? The gig has long been up, Foundit.\n \n \nGive me an example WHERE I APPLIED the Lemon Test, where I was guilty of over-applying it...\n Oooh. Let me guess. You can't do it.\n It's another CLAFCLO, isn't it...\n\n \n Foundit, when you just say \"LEMON TEST\" without qualifying how it applies, you DO over-apply it. Just throwing that out there without showing HOW it's been met IS overdoing it.\n \n \nCan you do us all a favor and STOP and THINK.\n\n \n Please stop it.\n \n Calm down, stop yelling, go and get yourself a drink or something, and chill for a bit. Multiple posters have now asked you to stop the \n hostility. Are you going to do so, or just keep on and pretend you aren't being hostile when it's clear you are? You don't represent \"ALL\" here at all, and you yourself need to stop and think. So just stop the BS right now, and settle down. 'Cause people are going to keep reporting you if you keep the incivility mode turned on.\n \n \nAre you saying that the EXISTING law (tax exempt, lemon law, violation of separation of church and state) are being used in \"vague generalities\"?\n\n \n No, I'm saying YOU aren't using them at all. You're just saying them without qualifying anything. You're not actually making any arguments here.\n \n - How does the support of prop 8 qualify as religious imposition? The only thing you seem to have as any sort of \"proof\" is that the supporters are religious. Big whoop!! That's not enough.\n \n - Where is the proof of this conspiracy theory of yours that the Mormon church as an organization is behind it and financing it, rather than indvididuals who happen to hold to that view and are part of the Mormon church?\n \n \nYou asked for examples of my position for elaboration, and I simply point you to the EXISTING COURT CASES so you can understand EXACTLY what my position is for elaboration...\n\n \n Exactly .... you pointed to the speed limit sign. You didn't prove anyone was speeding. You don't seem to understand those are two different things, and that you also have the burden to prove specifically how it's being violated, not just to quote the law.",

It's like you're trying to pretend I'm insisting on the irrational, when it's you who can't even seem to admit some of the simplest and most obvious things.\n I have never argued that Christians don't have some menial and inconsequential method of dealing with divorce.\n I point people to statistics on Christians and divorce, which show that some groups like evangelicals have WORSE divorce rates than atheists...\n \n \n \nCLAFCLO.\n\n Wrong again.\n As long as you continue to try to change my points on GOVERNMENT to SOCIETY, these comments are VERY relevant.\n \n \n \nI have not said government and society were not two separate entities.\n\n CLAFCLO.\n Was there ANYWHERE in that statement where I argued otherwise???\n \n \n \nBut one influences the other and that's what you don't seem to want to acknowledge.\n\n Not only irrelevant, it's an interesting pretense...\n Can you show any person who changed their opinion on something cause the government made gay marriage legal?\n Anybody in Massachusetts who woke up, saw that gay marriage was legal, and then decided that gay was okay?\n \n \n \nAgain, government would NEVER have made interracial marriage legal if society hadn't evolved, and therefore the issue made it through SOME extent of the court of public opinion.\n\n Completely CLAFCLO.\n The issue that prompted this was how you keep trying to take my observations on GOVERNMENTAL ACTION and substitute \"society\" in virtually every response.\n It DOES NOT MATTER to the point I was making, regarding your repeated obfuscational behavior.\n \n \n \nThen what and who determines what constitutes legitimate state interests? YOU? No thanks. If society can't determine that on it's own, then it's a sad situation indeed for all.\n\n Ahh.\n So Jyoshu finally admits that he's clueless.\n FINALLY admits that he doesn't know what I'm talking about regarding \"legitimate state interest\", despite all this time of trying to obfuscate the issue.\n No, Jyoshu, I don't determine legitimate state interest.\n SCOTUS and legal precedent establish legitimate state interest.\n \n \n \nFoundit, for whatever reason, you are really in a foul mood. Look in the mirror if you want to see someone who doesn't understand the issue, and stop childishly throwing out the \"you just don't understand it\" junk.\n\n Jyoshu, I don't understand quantum physics.\n That's not a slur on me. I just don't understand it.\n YOUR problem is that you take offense over something you shouldn't.\n You obviously DO NOT understand what is being discussed regarding \"legitimate state interest\" or what is being discussed regarding \"separation of church and state\".\n If you try to approach the discussion by INQUIRING or DOING YOUR OWN RESEARCH, that's one thing. Learning is respectable.\n But when YOU try to turn around and obfuscate your confusion onto other people, that's repugnant.\n \n It's not a foul mood. Show me any teacher which would put up with a kid trying to disrupt the class when the kid is clueless on the subject matter...\n \n \n \nStop the tactics, because I understand it just fine. YOU'RE not the arbiter or who understands them and who doesn't anyway. You've given NO reason here to think you're any sort of expert on these issues.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n You just demonstrated that YOU DID NOT KNOW WHO establishes groundrules on \"legitimate state interest\".\n And then you turn around and pretend you \"understand it just fine\"???\n Man Jyoshu. You REALLY don't understand how much of yourself you reveal to others...\n \n \n \nCLAFCLO again. \n\n Wrong.\n Look at my statements.\n I said \"IF you ...\"\n I never said you were doing that...\n Try to pay attention.\n \n \n \nObviously that'sn not the case, as it was still a minority that supported interracial marriage when it was made legal.\n\n A ray of light in a post otherwise demonstrating obfuscation and confusion.\n \n Perhaps you can take this a step further then and explain how there is ANY SIGNIFICANCE to your commentary on \"societal evolution\" with regards to what the government must do in TODAY's WORLD regarding gay discrimination???\n \n \n \nNo, it has not. You've not demonstrated such evidence that it's only \"organizations\" at all!\n\n As I've already mentioned, the discussion becomes a demonstration of a herd of black and white zebras thundering across the plains, while some people insist that pink zebras exist.\n I urge posters to review the thread where this was discussed if they have any doubts.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/11453-poll-most-anti-gay-groups-motivated-christianity.html\n It was a simple challenge to show ANY anti-gay group that is not Christian based. There were some efforts to try to name some examples, but they were all shown having Christian roots.\n \n \n \nNope, it doesn't have to be in the BIBLE for it to be a basis. Again, it's not in the Bible for Amish to not use electricity, but it's something they take seriously. No one ever said it had to be in the Bible for it to be a religious basis.\n\n Jyoshu, you mistake the point.\n This demonstrates that RELIGION is being used as an EXCUSE FOR PREJUDICE.\n They did the same thing with blacks.\n On the issue of women, amusingly enough there IS biblical justification for discrimination. But that's a different story...\n \n \n \nI know that's what you're SAYING. You just haven't proven it.\n\n Once again, black and white zebra vs pink zebra territory.\n I can't prove a negative, which is what you're demanding \"proof\" of...\n \n A better question would be for you to show religiously inspired push for governmental discrimination against gays which is NOT \"prejudice\"...\n \n I mean, realistically the answer is obvious.\n But it just gets back to how you will argue even the most mindless position.\n \n \n \nIt's frankly a stupid discussion that is two different ways of saying the same thing for all practical purposes, so why you're making such a stink about it is anyone's guess.\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n This is jyoshu speak for his pre-emptive strike for back-peddling on the issue...\n He demands proof from me, but at the same time says it's \"stupid\".\n And the really funny thing about all this? It's HIS STATEMENT which prompted this discussion in the first place... emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nAgain, CLAFCLO.\n\n You have seriously lost track of the REAL PURPOSE of that statement.\n Can you show how my originating statement qualifies these statements???\n 1) Does nothing to actually refute what I said.\n 2) Does not address what I said.\n 3) Pretends to do either (or both) of the above.\n \n Cause we went down this road cause YOU TRIED to argue that Martin Luther King's efforts for civil rights, and people supporting him, could be viewed as \"judging\".\n That was YOUR argument.\n I was responding to THAT argument.\n And your response is trying to ignore that, and obfuscate the issue.\n \n \n \nFoundit, drop the egomaniac attempts at intimidation and personal attacks.\n\n Jyoshu, drop the passive aggressive junk.\n It's getting REALLY old, and you know it doesn't work with me.\n \n \n \nGiven what you just said, your consistent penchant for brow-beating and yelling at people (the all-caps thing you do so much--something you should know is considered yelling in an online venue), and that multiple posters now have called you on the goalpost changing that you do regularly, it's frankly ironic that anyone would consider you a \"moderator\" on any message board (though thank goodness, not this one). \n\n Funny how you talk about \"personal attacks\", but then you pull that one... emoticon_frazzled\n Jyoshu, I've got respect from others.\n We both know you can't say the same, exact from people like Ethmi, or Steeeeve, or Archie...\n \n But go ahead and continue to complain about \"personal attacks\" as you share other people's personal information.\n It really highlights your hypocrisy!\n \n \n \nUm ... do you really think a couple of Wikipedia links demonstrates your opinion?\n\n It's an effort to educate you on application of the Lemon Test, and ergo a demonstration of my opinion on specific cases.\n Silly me for trying to actually ANSWER your question cause I should have expected that in doing so you'd just try to obfuscate the situation...\n \n \n \nYou need to show HOW it demostrates what YOUR arguing.\n\n It's funny how you continue this absurd charade.\n You complain you don't understand my opinion, and that I haven't given it...\n ... even while I repeatedly explain to you that the Lemon Test is a perfect example of my position.\n You complain that I haven't given specifics...\n ... and when I do, you insist that everybody knows what I'm talking about as you insist I haven't explained it...\n emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nWho do you really think you're fooling here, at this point?\n\n Honestly jyoshu.\n I should be asking you that question...\n \n \n \nFoundit, when you just say \"LEMON TEST\" without qualifying how it applies, you DO over-apply it.\n\n I just gave TWO EXAMPLES of how the Lemon Test is applied, and then you turn around and say I didn't...\n \n \n \nCalm down, stop yelling, go and get yourself a drink or something, and chill for a bit. Multiple posters have now asked you to stop the hostility.\n\n You and Sigma?\n Sigma has a tendency to pull the passive aggressive junk like you. Sigma's complaint wasn't even \"hostility\" from me, but me just trying to get Sigma to answer a question which I had asked multiple times but he/she kept ignoring.\n If something is out of line, report it.\n Otherwise, quit with the passive-aggressive junk.\n \n \n \nYou don't represent \"ALL\" here at all, and you yourself need to stop and think. So just stop the BS right now, and settle down. 'Cause people are going to keep reporting you if you keep the incivility mode turned on.\n\n I urge them to do so.\n When I first got to this board, you tried this passive-aggressive junk with me, saying the EXACT same thing.\n I'm not going to cower on claims of \"going to report you\" when I am not doing anything wrong.\n \n \n \nNo, I'm saying YOU aren't using them at all. You're just saying them without qualifying anything. You're not actually making any arguments here.\n\n Oh DEAR GAWD Jyoshu. Can you PLEASE try to KEEP UP with the point of the discussion???\n The reason that this all came up is cause YOU ASKED WHAT MY OPINION WAS regarding separation of church and state. What my limits were regarding \"preaching from the pulpit\" and other examples...\n I EXPLAINED that by saying I hold to the existing status quo. It reflects my opinion.\n And now you are asking me to \"quantify\" even after I give you specifics (lemon test, separation of church and state, legitimate state interest) and also give you specific applications???\n emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \n- How does the support of prop 8 qualify as religious imposition? The only thing you seem to have as any sort of \"proof\" is that the supporters are religious. Big whoop!! That's not enough.\n\n CLAFCLO.\n I never said anything about \"my proof is that the supporters are religious\".\n I would agree that just saying \"supporters are religious\" is not enough.\n \n \n \n- Where is the proof of this conspiracy theory of yours that the Mormon church as an organization is behind it and financing it, rather than indvididuals who happen to hold to that view and are part of the Mormon church?\n\n Mormons make up 2% of the population, but 1/3 of the funding.\n Plus, church leaders sent out letters to church members telling them to donate.\n \n I realize you aren't going to accept any proof of anything, but I'll just keep pointing to it each time you insist that it hasn't been done.\n \n \n \nYou asked for examples of my position for elaboration, and I simply point you to the EXISTING COURT CASES so you can understand EXACTLY what my position is for elaboration...\n\n \nExactly .... you pointed to the speed limit sign. You didn't prove anyone was speeding.\n\n Again, you're trying to obfuscate to a repugnant degree.\n You asked WHAT MY OPINION WAS regarding separation of church and state.\n If you now want to ask MORE STUFF regarding \"prove somebody violates it\", then make that NEW request...\n You're also trying to obfuscate the \"other\" thread on the Mormons into this issue, but the point that this is a NEW request should not be lost on the viewer.\n \n Moreover, When I CLAIM somebody is speeding (like in the Mormon thread), THAT is where you should ask for proof on that.\n Furthermore, we're back to you pretending I haven't given something I ALREADY HAVE.\n I just gave you two lemon test cases.\n I just gave you examples of \"speeding laws\" being applied.\n You ignored them, claiming everybody knew them, then turned around and pretended that I never showed anybody speeding???\n \n Like I said.

It gets tiresome writing an entire paragraph just to explain what you have \"once again\" pulled. emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \n(Incidentally, it's no longer just me, by the way--at least you're spreading the love more now! \n\n Not sure what that is supposed to mean...\n \n \n \nYou've put the brick wall up and obviously nothing anyone says is going to give you pause.

   "And furthermore Jyoshu?\n The fact that it is ARCHIE who commiserates with you???\n Proves my point even more about your tactics... \n \n A person can be judged by the company he keeps, and in that I am quite comfortable.\n You on the other hand, spend an inordinate amount of time talking to yourself and keeping company with the likes of Archie... \n\n \n First of all foundit, it isn't just jyoshu and me who oppose your dishonest style of obfuscation while responding to our arguments, don't forget about steeeeve, NATO, Ethmi and DR, not to mention others who try to reason with you, who have been frustrated in attempting to get you respond honestly to their arguments also. But the arguments against same sex marriage are reasoned, rational and numerous. None of which you will respond to honestly as you attempt to justify your arguments for it.\n \n I concur that each person in our society deserves equal rights. But redefining marriage is not about equal rights but about adding special rights to our laws and Constitution. Currently we all have the same right to marry a person of the opposite sex who is of a certain age and background. We don't give people the right to marry their siblings. We don't give people the right to marry a young child. As a society we have placed certain limits on marriage but give everyone the equal right to marry under those specified conditions.\n \n When we redefine marriage, then all sorts of new relationships will also vie for social acceptance. Already the legalization of same-sex marriage in one state had resulted in the call for the legalization of polygamy. Some gay activists are calling for the legalization of polyamory (multiple sexual relationships with multiple partners) because they see that as a two pronged approach to get what they want. \n \n We should also realize that the government is not prohibiting homosexuals from engaging in their behavior or even having a partner. All government is saying is that it is not going to redefine marriage to include same-sex relationships. And when citizens of this country have been given an opportunity to vote on a constitutional amendment in their state defining marriage, they have overwhelmingly approved of the traditional definition of marriage.\n \n As we have already noted, the push for same-sex marriage has been more about respect and acceptance than it has been about rights. If government recognizes the legal validity of gay marriage, then that places government's \"seal of approval\" on homosexuality.\n \n Often when gay activists are calling for equal rights, they are really asking for special benefits. Homosexuals have the same right to marry as heterosexuals. They have the right to marry a qualified person (age, marital status) of the opposite sex. Homosexuals and heterosexuals cannot marry someone of the same sex, someone who is too young, someone who is already married, etc.\n \n But the activists argue that because they cannot marry someone of the same sex, they lose out on certain benefits. But that is not a justification for redefining marriage. It may be a justification for reconsidering the benefits we provide as a society as Sarah Palin did as Governor of Alaska, but it isn't a justification for changing the definition of marriage.\n \n Consider the issue of visitation rights. Gay activists argue that government needs to grant same-sex marriage rights to homosexuals so they will have visitation rights. But again, this may be an argument for changing the laws concerning visitation as Sarah Palin did in Alaska, but it isn't an argument for redefining marriage.\n \n A bigger question is whether this is really a problem. In this day where major corporations and governmental entities are granting domestic partnership rights, it is difficult to see this as a problem. If such a case were brought to light people could use public pressure to force the hospital to change its policies.\n \n So redefining marriage is another attempt by homosexual activists to normalize homosexuality in the larger social context because it isn't necessary to redefine marriage in order to deal with the social issues which are seen as inequities by the homosexual community. Can you deny that these arguments are valid, rational and correct regarding the downside of redefining marriage for the sake of offering your small community special rights?",

Posters AREN'T wrong based on whether he or anyone else weighs in, in agreement or disagreement with them. There is no guilt or condemnation merely by someone agreeing or disagreeing on the basis that it's a given POSTER doing it. This \"oh, it's Archie\" basis for things is a cop-out, pure and simple. I don't agree with everything Archie says, but at the same time I'm not going to go along with some bandwagon against him--if people think it's important to do so, then they are going to have to REFUTE him where he's wrong; there are no easy passes here. Peoples' posts and arguments, including Archie's, will be judged on post-by-post basis. I think it says far more about anyone (insert \"Foundit\" here) that would try to use a guilt-by-association tactic just because someone happened to agree with a particular post than it does about anything--or anyone--else here. In essense ... If Archie says something that's wrong, then he's wrong, and if he says something that's RIGHT, then so be it, but we shouldn't care if that's Archie or anyone else--they are right or wrong based on the merits of what's said, NOT because of what poster it happens to be. POSTS are the things being judged and refuted here, not POSTERS; after all posters sometimes write agreeable things sometimes disagreeable things. We really shouldn't condemn a post 'just 'cause it's Archie.' That's the wrong basis for things. In essence, if anyone has a problem with a given post that Archie or anyone else puts out there, they can post a reply to that post and therefore an attempt at rebuttal. But just asserting 'oh, it's Archie' certainly doesn't cut it, nor does an post's correctness have anything to do with whether he or anyone else weighs in on it.",

All government is saying is that it is not going to redefine marriage to include same-sex relationships. And when citizens of this country have been given an opportunity to vote on a constitutional amendment in their state defining marriage, they have overwhelmingly approved of the traditional definition of marriage.\n \n As we have already noted, the push for same-sex marriage has been more about respect and acceptance than it has been about rights. If government recognizes the legal validity of gay marriage, then that places government's \"seal of approval\" on homosexuality.\n \n Often when gay activists are calling for equal rights, they are really asking for special benefits. Homosexuals have the same right to marry as heterosexuals. They have the right to marry a qualified person (age, marital status) of the opposite sex. Homosexuals and heterosexuals cannot marry someone of the same sex, someone who is too young, someone who is already married, etc.\n \n But the activists argue that because they cannot marry someone of the same sex, they lose out on certain benefits. But that is not a justification for redefining marriage. It may be a justification for reconsidering the benefits we provide as a society as Sarah Palin did as Governor of Alaska, but it isn't a justification for changing the definition of marriage.\n \n Consider the issue of visitation rights. Gay activists argue that government needs to grant same-sex marriage rights to homosexuals so they will have visitation rights. But again, this may be an argument for changing the laws concerning visitation as Sarah Palin did in Alaska, but it isn't an argument for redefining marriage.\n \n A bigger question is whether this is really a problem. In this day where major corporations and governmental entities are granting domestic partnership rights, it is difficult to see this as a problem. If such a case were brought to light people could use public pressure to force the hospital to change its policies.\n \n So redefining marriage is another attempt by homosexual activists to normalize homosexuality in the larger social context because it isn't necessary to redefine marriage in order to deal with the social issues which are seen as inequities by the homosexual community. Can you deny that these arguments are valid, rational and correct regarding the downside of redefining marriage for the sake of offering your small community special rights?\n \n \n \n Here's my post and foundit's response. Thanks for proving my point regarding the depth of your denial of the realities of why there is no valid reason to redefine marriage. But your excuses do nothing to change the facts that the homosexual community is more concerned with normalizing homosexuality than the right to marry, itself, since all of the so called equal benefits you seek can be gained without ever redefining marriage at all.\n\n \n Heres the deal Archie. It's not the fact that benefits are so much the issue. Or even marriage itself. What is the issue is that in peoples eyes I am a second class citizen. We (being gays) are second class citizens. We live our lives in the shadow of an intolerant society and some who would even hurt or kills us for who we are. \n \n You fail to see that all we want is to be able to live our lives with the same rights and freedoms as our fellow hetero citizens. I don't want to walk down the street with my bf and get insulted or spat on. Just recently a lesbian couple in Canada were assualted by a man as they were dropping off their daughters to school. Mind you this happened in front of the school in front of the kids. /http://www.towleroad.com/ \n \n The point being is that gays live in constant awareness and even fear!

   "Olberman asks that very question: why is it such an issue? This is a very heartfelt commentary:\n \n See the video of what is pasted below it.\n \n \n msnbc.com Video Player\n \n Llink to video is above.\n \n \n Olbermann: Gay marriage is a question of love \n Everyone deserves the same chance at permanence and happiness\n CAMPAIGN COMMENT\n By Keith Olbermann\n Anchor, 'Countdown'\n updated 9:13 p.m. ET, Mon., Nov. 10, 2008\n \n Finally tonight as promised, a Special Comment on the passage, last week, of Proposition Eight in California, which rescinded the right of same-sex couples to marry, and tilted the balance on this issue, from coast to coast.\n \n Some parameters, as preface. This isn't about yelling, and this isn't about politics, and this isn't really just about Prop-8. And I don't have a personal investment in this: I'm not gay, I had to strain to think of one member of even my very extended family who is, I have no personal stories of close friends or colleagues fighting the prejudice that still pervades their lives.\n \n And yet to me this vote is horrible. Horrible. Because this isn't about yelling, and this isn't about politics. This is about the human heart, and if that sounds corny, so be it.\n \n If you voted for this Proposition or support those who did or the sentiment they expressed, I have some questions, because, truly, I do not understand. Why does this matter to you? What is it to you? In a time of impermanence and fly-by-night relationships, these people over here want the same chance at permanence and happiness that is your option. They don't want to deny you yours. They don't want to take anything away from you. They want what you want-a chance to be a little less alone in the world.\n \n Only now you are saying to them-no. You can't have it on these terms. Maybe something similar. If they behave. If they don't cause too much trouble. You'll even give them all the same legal rights-even as you're taking away the legal right, which they already had. A world around them, still anchored in love and marriage, and you are saying, no, you can't marry. What if somebody passed a law that said you couldn't marry?\n \n I keep hearing this term \"re-defining\" marriage. If this country hadn't re-defined marriage, black people still couldn't marry white people. Sixteen states had laws on the books which made that illegal in 1967. 1967.\n \n The parents of the President-Elect of the United States couldn't have married in nearly one third of the states of the country their son grew up to lead. But it's worse than that. If this country had not \"re-defined\" marriage, some black people still couldn't marry black people. It is one of the most overlooked and cruelest parts of our sad story of slavery. Marriages were not legally recognized, if the people were slaves. Since slaves were property, they could not legally be husband and wife, or mother and child. Their marriage vows were different: not \"Until Death, Do You Part,\" but \"Until Death or Distance, Do You Part.\" Marriages among slaves were not legally recognized.\n \n You know, just like marriages today in California are not legally recognized, if the people are gay.\n \n And uncountable in our history are the number of men and women, forced by society into marrying the opposite sex, in sham marriages, or marriages of convenience, or just marriages of not knowing, centuries of men and women who have lived their lives in shame and unhappiness, and who have, through a lie to themselves or others, broken countless other lives, of spouses and children, all because we said a man couldn't marry another man, or a woman couldn't marry another woman. The sanctity of marriage. \n \n How many marriages like that have there been and how on earth do they increase the \"sanctity\" of marriage rather than render the term, meaningless?\n \n What is this, to you? Nobody is asking you to embrace their expression of love. But don't you, as human beings, have to embrace... that love? The world is barren enough.\n \n It is stacked against love, and against hope, and against those very few and precious emotions that enable us to go forward. Your marriage only stands a 50-50 chance of lasting, no matter how much you feel and how hard you work.\n \n And here are people overjoyed at the prospect of just that chance, and that work, just for the hope of having that feeling. With so much hate in the world, with so much meaningless division, and people pitted against people for no good reason, this is what your religion tells you to do? With your experience of life and this world and all its sadnesses, this is what your conscience tells you to do?\n \n With your knowledge that life, with endless vigor, seems to tilt the playing field on which we all live, in favor of unhappiness and hate... this is what your heart tells you to do? You want to sanctify marriage? You want to honor your God and the universal love you believe he represents? Then Spread happiness-this tiny, symbolic, semantical grain of happiness-share it with all those who seek it. Quote me anything from your religious leader or book of choice telling you to stand against this. And then tell me how you can believe both that statement and another statement, another one which reads only \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\"\n \n You are asked now, by your country, and perhaps by your creator, to stand on one side or another. You are asked now to stand, not on a question of politics, not on a question of religion, not on a question of gay or straight. You are asked now to stand, on a question of love. All you need do is stand, and let the tiny ember of love meet its own fate. \n \n You don't have to help it, you don't have it applaud it, you don't have to fight for it. Just don't put it out. Just don't extinguish it. Because while it may at first look like that love is between two people you don't know and you don't understand and maybe you don't even want to know. It is, in fact, the ember of your love, for your fellow person just because this is the only world we have. And the other guy counts, too.\n \n This is the second time in ten days I find myself concluding by turning to, of all things, the closing plea for mercy by Clarence Darrow in a murder trial.\n \n But what he said, fits what is really at the heart of this:\n \n \"I was reading last night of the aspiration of the old Persian poet, Omar-Khayyam,\" he told the judge. It appealed to me as the highest that I can vision. I wish it was in my heart, and I wish it was in the hearts of all: So I be written in the Book of Love; I do not care about that Book above. Erase my name, or write it as you will, So I be written in the Book of Love.\"\n \n \n \u00a9 2008 msnbc.com\n URL: Olbermann: Gay marriage is a question of love - Countdown with Keith Olbermann",

The attempts to deflect to the previous administration are already starting!

My prediction is that, before it's over, people will be calling for the \"changes\" to stop.\n \n \nWhat the heck are you talking about?[concerning Obama restricting civil rights of free speech]\n\n \n Obama is appointing someone who supports the fairness doctrine (!) as commissioner to the FCC, for heaven's sake. He's APPOINTING people who want to invade on civil rights. And Obama has given mixed signals in terms of his view on trying to 'balance' the airwaves. \n \n \nemoticon_frazzled\n Yeah.\n Cause heaven knows the Republican party would never appoint a partisan person, or act in a partisan manner... emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n \"Republicans!\"\n \n \"Republicans, I tell you!\"\n \n Yeah, that's the answer to everything. No need to question the other party or leaders; just say \"Republican!!\" and you're magically free to follow blindly, without question ... Failure of Republicans means Democrats will never do any wrong and should be followed without question.\n \n \nI think the public is tired of the lies from the McCain camp\n\n \n They are tired of ANY politicians lying, Foundit, including your man, Obama. He lied about public funds and campaign financing. And all the misrepresentations which were lies too, about McCain (e.g. the Obama camp claiming McCain wanted to be in Iraq for 100 more years.) It seems you have an awfully selective view of this lying thing, to where you don't acknowledge ANY on one side, and ONLY point fingers at the other, when in fact it's been done on BOTH sides.",

Not unlike the way Clinton haters carried on about Clinton LONG after he was out of office at the expense of giving a critical eye to Bush's administration.\n\n At least you note the similarities.\n But then you fail to notice the significant difference.\n \n My point is to the commentary on PEOPLE'S CONCERN over presidential actions.\n It's not a commentary on \"Bush\". What it REALLY is revolves around the REASONING for bringing others bringing it up in the first place.\n \n \n \nQuite simply, Obama's voting record is where people are getting the concern that he will take away civil rights like the right defend oneself adequately, or restrict free speech, or lax national security.\n\n Can you elaborate?\n Cause that sounds pretty darn flimsy.\n What did he vote on that hints he will take away civil rights?\n \n \n \nYou mean \"yes we can\"?\n \"Change\"? \n Yee hah. If buzz words are what passes for a 'message' now, I'd sure hate to see what it would look like without one.\n\n As with many of the attempts to detract from Barack's reasons for presidency, they make mountains out of mole-hills, and then ignore the legitimate construction which is going on.\n \n \n \nWhat \"message\" did you think Obama had? Specifically? (Let me guess, you'll ignore the call for specifics again, as usual.)\n\n His tax plan, for one.\n Do you need me to hold your hand to explain that one to you?\n Will I be forever plagued by this lame \"you don't give specifics\" junk when the truth is you're asking for what SHOULD be common knowledge (even according to you) but you want to ignore it.\n You ask for my standards on church and state, I explain it to you.\n You ask for specifics, I show you court cases where it was applied.\n And then you continue with the \"you didn't give specifics\" junk cause you don't understand what's going on...\n \n \n \nObama is appointing someone who supports the fairness doctrine (!) as commissioner to the FCC, for heaven's sake.\n\n The fairness doctrine, despite all the anti-hype and rhetoric, is not a restriction on free speech.\n It simply asks that BOTH SIDES of the story be produced.\n Nobody is prevented from saying what they want on the issues.\n \n \n \nHe's APPOINTING people who want to invade on civil rights.\n\n Again, you try to accuse me of things you yourself are guilty of.\n SPECIFICS?\n \n \n \n\"Republicans!\"\n \"Republicans, I tell you!\"\n Yeah, that's the answer to everything.

   "Can you elaborate?\n Cause that sounds pretty darn flimsy.\n What did he vote on that hints he will take away civil rights?\n\n \n For gosh sakes, the man wants to BAN the sale and transfer of semi-automatic weapons. Do you understand what that means exactly? That MOST defensive firearms these days are semi-automatic? And he endorsed the Illinois handgun ban ... a flat out BAN.\n \n This is exactly WHY gun sales are skyrocketing right now. In terms of 2nd amendment rights there is every reason to think this man is going to take civil rights away in that area. \n \n It's funny how some people only seem interested in Obama's record and stances on these sorts of issues AFTER the election. These are things you really should have become familiar with BEFORE the election. \n \n \nAs with many of the attempts to detract from Barack's reasons for presidency, they make mountains out of mole-hills, and then ignore the legitimate construction which is going on.\n\n \n The right to defend my family and my own life adequately is certainly no \"molehill\".\n \n \nHis tax plan, for one.\n\n \n Like the one that wants to put a 50 cent tax hike per gallon on gasoline to for the purpose of reducing consumtion? Yeah, real nice--make it harder for people to use something they NEED, just so they'll use less of it. \n \n It's funny how in all Obama's hoopla about 'only taxing those over 250k', nobody really challenged him on any OTHER taxes he wants to do. The press just wouldn't really challenge him on some of this stuff--he should have had to answer for that.

Of COURSE it's a restriction on free speech, Foundit. If it makes a radio station unable to spend an hour on conservative politics, for instance, then it has restricted them being free to say what what and how much they want. \n \n But what I can't help but wonder how you'll feel about the fairness doctrine when a radio show opposing a measure like Prop 8 will have to give up half their time speaking on BEHALF of gays to give equal time to those who oppose prop 8 ... or to those who say gays shouldn't be able to marry ... :) \n \n \nThe point is that BOTH Republicans AND Democrats are free to appoint whoever they want in THESE POSITIONS.\n\n \n CLAFCLO. No one has argued that they are not FREE to appoint who they want.
