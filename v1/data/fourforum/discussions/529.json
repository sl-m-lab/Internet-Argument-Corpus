President Bush (news - web sites) now says Syria, too, owns an arsenal of chemical weapons. \n \n But the list of countries with likely chemical, biological or nuclear weapons programs is not confined to nations Washington may consider hostile. It also includes such U.S. allies as Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, India and Taiwan. \n \n \"The allegation is, we use weapons of mass destruction as an excuse when we have it out for other countries,\" said Jon B. Wolfsthal, deputy director of the Non-Proliferation Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"We tend to look the other way when it suits our interest. That decision has come back to haunt us.\" \n \n Israel's nuclear weapons program is thought to include about 200 warheads deployed on ballistic missiles and aircraft, Wolfsthal said. In 2000, Israel placed nuclear-tipped missiles on three submarines, pushing its capabilities beyond those of declared nuclear states India and Pakistan - and possibly even China, Wolfsthal said. \n \n In a strategy reminiscent of Iraq and Afghanistan (news - web sites), Israel is believed to store nuclear missiles on mobile launchers in caves, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. \n \n Israel is also believed to stock chemical and biological weapons, according to the Carnegie Endowment and the Monterey Institute of International Studies, which track such issues. \n \n Israeli officials do not comment on the country's nuclear weapons potential. \n \n Egypt, another leading U.S. ally, is believed to harbor chemical weapons - including deadly sarin and VX agents - along with, perhaps, an offensive bioweapons capability, according to the Monterey Institute. \n \n India and Pakistan have publicly tested nuclear weapons. They are also suspected to be engaged in chemical and biological weapons research, according to Carnegie and Monterey. \n \n Taiwan, another staunch U.S. ally, probably maintains a chemical weapons program and may have a biological research program, according to Monterey. \n \n Saudi Arabia has bought nuclear-capable intermediate-range missiles from China, though the Saudis are not believed to have unconventional warheads to put in them, Wolfsthal said. \n \n Wolfsthal said the Bush administration would be shortsighted to single out Syria, North Korea (news - web sites), Iran and Iraq. Ignoring proliferation among allies like Israel and Pakistan has allowed the technology to spread further, he said. \n \n Israel is known to have aided South Africa's now-defunct nuclear program. Pakistan is believed to have cooperated with similar programs in North Korea and Iran. \n \n Other countries with current chemical and biological weapons stocks or research programs include Russia, China, Libya and Sudan, according to the Carnegie Endowment. \n \n The United States and Britain, both among the world's seven declared nuclear powers, developed their own chemical and biological weapons in the past. Britain has destroyed all such stocks, and the United States is still eliminating the last vestiges of its chemical weapons, said Amy Smithson, a chemical and biological weapons researcher with the Henry L. Stimson Center, a national security think tank in Washington. \n \n The United States still develops small amounts of weapons-grade chemical and biological toxins in order to defend against them, Smithson said.

   "First of all, you published a copywrited work without the expressed permission of the author. Secondly, are you suggesting we go to war with our allies based upon the word of academic intstitutions of higher learning? Surely, you could find something more definitive with regards to the chemical and biological weapons programs of nations like Israel and India. How about a primary source? How about a State Department memorandum? Find me anything that would suggest that it is lawful to go to war with Israel because they may/or may not have nuclear weapons (that information is classified). \n \n Fact is, Iraq was in violation of a armistice agreement that they signed after Gulf War I. The end of hostilities was contingent upon their owning up to their end of the agreement. That is the legality we needed to justify a war with them. North Korea is the same sort of scenario. But nothing would justify hostilities with some of the other nations you mentioned. Since Syria is a hot bed of terrorism, and they have aided and abetted Baathists, we can open up another front in this continued war in Iraq, if they do not take our threats seriously. \n \n The main difference here is that we have a reason to attack Syria, and it would be Idiotic to attack Israel, since they are our strongest allies in the region. By not making a distinction between the rather large differencees that exist, and by not producing your own argument, you have proven yourself to be rather simple minded. \n \n Fact is, since Clinton left our military depleted, and it is necessary to take them out one at a time in a stategic manner. You seem to be suggesting that we should go to war with everybody, including our allies, at once. Don't you think that's kind of dumb?",

   "^Are you trying to say that it's OK for the US and it's allies to posessess chemical and bio-logical weapons but not OK for any \"hostile\" country?\n \n Looks like the US and it's allies are in clear violation of the same thing.

   "You have not provided sufficient documentation for me to believe that our allies have the types of weapons you suggest. The nuclear weapons issue is entirely different than the biological and chemical weapons problem, as there are different treaties that cover those types of weapons.\n \n What then do you suggest? Sit back and do nothing while a madmad like Saddam Hussein develops WMD.\n \n If you want to know which allie has the most extensive biological weapons program, look no further than Russia.\n \n The list of of countries that you suggest have WMD seems a little weak. Can you find other sources that back the assertions laid out in this article?\n \n The U.S. does not have an offensive chemical or biological weapons program, niether do those nations which are closest to us, like Great Britian. Do we have ties with countries that might not be on the up and up? Maybe, but you have not laid out a decent method by which to respond to such countries. All you have really said is that you support peace, and since you believe these other countries have similar weapons to that of Iraq, we should do nothing regarding Iraq. What are you saying?",
