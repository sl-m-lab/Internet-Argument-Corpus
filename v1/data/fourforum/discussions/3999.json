   "Security walls were built pre historically, historically, and in present days to secure the people's safety behind those walls, and keep the announced terror, the pre expected fear, and the anticipated horror out; however, one wall in particular escaped the human race's attention because its hate stones were well subliminally crafted under a blanket of deceit, denial, and total ignorance of the world... \n \n Its name is the Wall of Arab's Hate. \n \n Detecting the geographic parameter of this Arabic Wall of Hate is like discovering the invisible dimensions beyond this universe we are living in... \n \n Though this hate wall's foundations goes back in history as far as the seven century when the Prophet of Islam united the Arabic tribes and switched their traditional practice of invading each other for food and animal graze to the invading of the surrounding none Arab tribes that were and still being called the unbeliever in accordance with the new faith. \n \n However today, this hate wall's earthly parameter is stretched in its height up to the tip of the Trade Center in New York, and suddenly expanded in its width to become as wide as the entire present world of ours... \n \n Despite the fact that the subliminal message the Prophet of Islam received played as the corner stone of that wall of Hate, it seems like the politic of Hate, boycott, and Jihad added along the pass of our human history many other strong earthly corner stones. \n \n Maybe it took the Chinese a long time to build the Great Wall of China, but the history tells me that the time used to build The Arabic Wall of Hate is only to be measured in generational span. \n \n One thing for sure, no Hague court can dig deep enough to topple this hate wall, yet the na\u00efve UN dared to a great degree and as boldly as becoming one of the most recent corner stones of that Arabic Wall of Hate not only because it took the victims of that wall of hate to its shameful court in Hague, but also because its goofy resolutions boys kept on firing one resolution after the other to ensure that the wall of hate grow even higher, wider, and deeper back to his roots; however, ignoring in the process that all the UN long lists of resolutions are nothing more than the consequences of resolution # 42, which wasn't implied by Arabia in 1948... \n \n Chronologically speaking, resolution number 42 fall ahead of a all the other resolutions that the UN asking Israel to imply; yet, I never heard the UN asking Arabia to imply it. \n \n The other recent corner stone that is called the civilized EU that tried through the entire past century to civilize Arabia but only to get camelized in this century with the hot steam of the anti-Semitism that came out of its cultural clash combination with Arabia, which make me wonder in this cloning sensation century if Hitler himself is cloned as the new European caliph. \n \n But there is no doubts in mind that the twisted logic of the Arab League when it comes in close contact with the political reality of the Middle East and the world is built on one single assumption or corner stone of hate that says; if you are not with us then you are against us; therefore, we must use a boycott stone... \n \n \n Countries who got cut in the middle of that political twisted logic of the hate wall couldn't approach Arabia except from one single and suspicious prospect that is called economical cooperation; however, that economical cooperation of which may seems logical in this Globalization era is costing the world its dignity, its humanity, and its independence for the benefit of the building of that wall of hate against Israel, and the Jews in general... \n \n I have no doubts that the reason why we both still talking pieces and peace is coming from our cultural depth, and if you believe my analysis here, then you must see that when Arabs talk pieces of land, they only do that because they are still building that same hate wall, while the peace we always talked about is a world of peace for the entire region that penetrate not only every street, but also every soul. \n \n Is there any leader Hague enough to say what about the subliminal FENCE of the ARABIC HATE? \n \n Jack the human",

   "Hate is the driving force in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. If the State of Israel were to suddenly disappear, Palestinians and the rest of the Muslim world would still hate the Jews. But the \"Zionists\" would no longer be a persistent pain in the middle of a Muslim neighborhood. And they could live with that.\n \n The enmity between the Jews and Muslims began after Muhammad, the founder of Islam,fled from his home in Mecca in 622 and settled in the relative safety of Medina in the northern part of Saudi Arabia. While there, his attempts to convert the local Jews to the new religion were rejected and the \"Prophet\" was subjected to ridicule.\n \n In chapter 5 of the Quran God declares, \"O You who believe, do not take as allies those who received the books (Jews) before you, but who now treat your religion as a joke and a game.\" The Quran is filled with exortations to kill the Jews, wherever you find them.\n \n Muhammad responded to the indignities by having his critics assassinated and by undertaking a jihad against Jewish villages. In April of 627, after the surrender of the Beni Quraidha near Medina, the Prophet had all of the captured men and boys of fighting age (about 900) beheaded. His campaign wiped out most of the Jews in the area. The women and children were taken as slaves and their property divided among the Muslim army.\n \n Three years before his death, Muhammad survived an attempt to poison him by a Jewish woman named Zainab. Some Muslims blame his death in 632 on the effects of the poison and thus consider Muhammad a martyr for having been killed by a Jew.\n \n As a result, the Quran does not deal kindly with the Jews. Every Muslim knows the history of bad blood that existed between the Prophet and his detractors.\n \n There is no compromise in Islam. Muslims consider the words in the Quran to be the words of God. There can be no criticism, no reformation. This \"perfect book\" is filled with examples of the horrible fate that awaits unbelievers, especially the Jews. \n \n The Muslim resentment is deeply embedded and Muslims are very vocal when Jews become the topic of conversation. Over the past twenty years my talks with Muslims from \"Palestine\", Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, Lebanon and Kuwait have elicited only negative comments.\n \n Responses to my questions can be summed up as a desire to see the State of Israel eliminated, or as a Pakistani professor put it, \"Why don't we make it (the reality of Israel) a myth?\"\n \n Abdul Aziz ibn Saud, founder of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, speaking for the Muslim perspective in 1937, said, \"Our hatred of the Jews dates from God's condemnation of them for their persecution and rejection of Isa [Jesus Christ] and their subsequent rejection later of His Chosen Prophet [Mohammad].\"\n \n He added, \"...God teaches us-- and we implicitly believe this... that for a Muslim to kill a Jew, or for him to be killed by a Jew, ensures him an immediate entry in Heaven and into the august presence of God Almighty.\"\n \n Whenever I interviewed Muslims, I would ask them to show me Palestine on a map. Each one would move his hand from north to south over Israel. A Palestinian added that they should have taken the land for peace deal. \"It would be a start.\" he said.\n \n Given that hatred of Jews is a fundamental part of Islam, any hope for a lasting peace between the two parties would require a drastic change in the religion itself. That will not happen.\n \n There is a very slim chance that Palestinian moderates (those who don't break things and kill people) will see that, in the short term, an agreement is the best route to follow. They will at least have a state. And it would be, as the Palestinian said in the interview, \"a start.\"\n \n Will a peace agreement bring peace? No. In the mind of a Muslim, whether in Riyadh or Detroit, this is a conflict destined to continue until the Jewish State ceases to exist. The Muslim true believers, the beheaders and suicide bombers, will continue to do whatever they can to make this a reality-God willing.",

   "Let me add to the worthy comments above. Islam is a supremacist ideology - imperialist in nature since its founding by a military leader 1400 years ago. While there is toleration of \"religions of the book\" - if they submit to Islamic rule and live as second-class citizens - all others must convert or be killed. Vicious irrational hatred of the Infidel is not  accidental given the supremacist nature of this religious ideology. I explore this further in my essay.\n \n Let me quickly point out that the demographic  group \"Muslims\" includes many who do not fully practice the religion. This includes those who are secular but still use the label, Muslim. Let's keep straight the practitioners of this jihadist  ideology and nominal-Muslims.",
