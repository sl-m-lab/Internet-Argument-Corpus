   "What a lovely, sweet nursery rhyme...\n \n Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop,\n When the wind blows, the cradle will rock,\n When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall,\n And down will come baby, cradle and all.\n \n It's so lovely and sweet, I wonder how many quiet children have been sung to sleep with it... ahhhhhh......\n \n Pity the baby smashes to their death at the end though... now that I think of it, what was the baby doing in the treetops in the first place!?\n \n This total disconnection from content we get in the odd nursery rhyme interests me. Ringa Ringa Roses is a veiled reference to the black plague, Waltzing Matilda involves the main character committing suicide, there are plenty of other examples.\n \n It interests me because in hindsight, it's precisely the same thing which allows us to read the Old Testament without forming the conclusion that it's full of utterly ghastly nonsense. How many hymns do people glibly sing at church each week which talk about destruction, pain, genocide, killing, and hell? The Westboro Baptist Church is a classic for this - just listen to the things they get their kids to yell at people passing by. They don't even understand the words they're using, by the time they do it's all just glibly accepted.\n \n It's pretty funny, really... the Bible is - in every meaningful sense - X-rated, full of sex and violence. But make something a memory verse, or chuck it in catchy tune, or hey, just read it to your kids in a sweet voice, and it's all good.\n \n \n P.S. Rockabye may contain some symbolic and historical references, giving it some genuine meaning, but this hardly changes the fact that people glibly babble it off without a second thought.",
