   "Here is a clearly written analysis of what is in the recent 787 Billion Dollar Stimulus Package that was rammed through congress based on the fear factor pushed by Obama and Company.\n \n Some of it is stimulus spending...some of it tax cuts (stimulus) and some of it window dressing (dressing the window of a meat market...looking like pork chops)\n \n Those of you that have time and may be so inclined, please add up the items in each category and tell be how much you think could have been easily trimmed off of our tab. We owe, we owe...so off to work we go.\n \n \n http://www.pattonboggs.com/files/News/89cf7c94-1323-4ff5-9934-112c5ff733d7/Presentation/NewsAttachment/c7ee83f0-bb17-40a3-8c65-1ef511e12678/Patton_Boggs_Stimulus_Analysis.pdf",

   "the spending may be pork, but how can you fix this without some spending in unlikely places. The tax cuts the Republicans prescribe only help a little. They stop helping once you get to people on welfare. You don't tax people on welfare, you use tax money on them. And, with the number of jobs availible decreasing the people on welfare can't get a job.emoticon_idea\n \n Also, the only way to stimulate the economy is to spend. The safest way to spend is through the government. You can be sure that the government will spend the money it is denying itself, but you can't be sure that the money the government is not recieving because of tax breaks will be spent. Some will, no doubt, but not all. So government spending is more reliable. thus it is not entirely pork if you look at it closer.\n \n Infrastructure spending is both needed and helpful. Look at this picture-when someone pays to renovate their house, they pay not only the workers on the site but also the engineers and architects who designed the space, the people who log the wood or mine the steel, the screw and bolt makers, the retail stores they were bought from, the transporters of the product, the places the workers buy from for their family, the makers of the accesories and so on. It is also helpful and needs get done because we don't want any collapsing bridges or exploding manhole covers.\n \n Spending in this way is more significant that tax cuts. If our goal is to create jobs, which it is, this provides the spending for those jobs. Buisnesses can't survive without an influx of capital, and this provides the capital. Also tax cuts won't be remembered in 25 years but spending will because we will have remarkable new, improved infrastructure to admire and little Jimmy will not fall through a hole in the waterslide because the government was there to help. And likewise Uncle Peter will be able to drive over a bridge without worrying if it will collapse.",

   "Go forward to page 124 of Idly's report:\n \nCONCLUSION\n Now that President Obama has signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 the hard work of implementation begins at a fast pace. Never before will so much have been spent, on so many, in so few days. The clear intent of the legislation is to provide federal funding on an expedited basis to create jobs and to jump start the economy. Most of the spending &#8211; 75 percent- is to be done by the third quarter of 2010. The decisions on how to make funding decisions and whom to fund will be made in the next few months if not weeks. We anticipate that the notification of grant availability to begin perhaps as early as April, with the award of grants beginning sometime by early Summer. The stimulus package provides a tremendous opportunity for those who are well organized and can link their objectives to the national interest of reversing the economic downturn,\n putting the money from the federal government back into the economy where it belongs. Given the speed with which implementation will occur, extra care must be taken to assure full compliance with all legal requirements, and for interested parties to understand the full implications of what will be expected by the government from those who receive stimulus funding. Please do not hesitate to contact Patton Boggs LLP to discuss your needs further, and to obtain further information. We will be constantly monitoring developments and updating information which is of importance to you.\n \n We encourage you to regularly visit our website (Patton Boggs) and our Media Center (Patton Boggs | Media Center), where we will provide updates on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\n",
