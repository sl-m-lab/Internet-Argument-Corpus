   "it is illegal to lie to congress and engage in pre-emptive war against international ruling. this is what bush has done, bush told congress that we had to go to war against iraq and remove saddam because he was linked to al qaeda, violated weapons sanctions, possessed wmds and was an immenent threat to the united states. NONE of those things were true. \n \n now we are saying that we are in iraq to liberate the iraqi people. its a good excuse, but it could never stand in congress as a reason to declare war. bush knew that if he had used that reason in the first place congress would have slammed him for it, so he lied. that is illegal and grounds upon which he can be impeached\n \n furthermore, bush withheld information about the attacks and didnt declare that bin laden was the perpertrator until weeks after 9/11, even though the pentagon knew bin laden was behind those attacks withing 24 hours of 9/11\n \n bush has also lied about going to war to eliminate terror, and about \"hunting down terrorists\". he has done nothing of the sort. bush has graciouisly allowed bin laden and top taliban leaders to escape afghanistan before he sent his measly 11,000 troops there to hunt them. and while it is public knowledge that al qaeda has branches in syria, egypt, saudi arabia, yemen, oman, lebanon, sudan, jordan, and about a dozen other countries, iraq NOT being one of them, yet bush has seen fit to invade iraq on falsities and has neglected the countries that terrorism thrives\n \n not only that, but bush has lied about making the country safer in every speech he has made since our invasion. the fact is that anti-american hatred, muslim fundamentalism and terrorist organization strengths are ALL increased, and are on an increasing trend. also, because we are spending so much resources in \"liberating iraq\" we are leaving our own defences at home thin, both for man-power and funds. in the event that another attack occurs, it will seriously cripple our economy to a doomsday-like chaos. and with bin laden on the loose and our intelligence unaware of his whereabouts and plans (just like before 9/11), the possiblity of such an attack occuring is very real\n \n right now activist groups around the country are actively working towards impeaching bush\n \n http://www.impeachbush.tv/\n http://impeachbush.meetup.com/\n http://impeachcentral.com/\n \n or just type \"impeach bush\" in google",

   "The Iraqi Liberation Act of 1998 can be found here.\n \n Please note Section 3 wherein it says:\n \n SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD IRAQ.\n \n It should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime.\n \n It was not George's idea. It had been planted in his mind by the previous administration, as was the intelligence he used to pull the trigger.\n\n It wasn't W's idea, but it really wasn't Clinton's idea either. It was Wolfowitz and Pearle (and some others) who had this policy since 1992. They finally convinced Clinton to call for regime change. Clinton did NOT want that to come about through a war.\n \n The language reads \"support efforts\" and \"promote emergence.\"\n It does not say \"remove by force\" or \"design new govt.\"\n \n .",

   "Ultimately, the Iraq issue goes back to whether or not you want to blame the president for the bad intelligence he got. \n\n Rummy et al. did what's called Data Mining. Where they took a bunch of old unrelated intellegence (and some forged and made up) and strung it together to make it look like something. The CIA was constantly hounding the admin (and DOD) to stop using the language it was using in the sale of the war because it didn't reflect the actual situation on the ground. \n \nThat's the crux of the issue.

   "Ultimately, the Iraq issue goes back to whether or not you want to blame the president for the bad intelligence he got. \n \n It's like saying we should fire a police chief for having his officers burst into a house whom he had been told by credible sources held a big cache of automatic weapons, even though they got inside and none were found.\n \n That's the crux of the issue. But it's really a moot point now--the election is over and the majority Americans sided with the police chief . . . um, er, the president.\n\n the blame falls squarely upon the president for accepting and acting upon the untrue testimony he got from chalabi, whose open motive was to dethrone saddam, and disregarding the documented evidence of the un inspectors, whose institution created the sanctions in the first place. the president is also to blame for continuing to act as though the information he recieved was true, when it is public knowledge that it was untrue. if it was exposed that the information was untrue in the beginning, we would have never gone to war for those reasons, and to this day we have no good reason for going to war. yet we are at war, falsities of the information exposed and all\n \n not only that, but the president is to blame for shifting the focus of the war away from terrorism and towards iraq in the first place.\n \n why shouldnt the president be held responsible for his decision?",
