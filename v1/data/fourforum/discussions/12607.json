   "What did Mr. Weissbourd's research tell him? That nowadays \"well-intentioned adults undermine children's moral and emotional development.\" Parents have abandoned the \"moral task\" of rearing children, he says, and are more concerned about fostering their happiness than their goodness. Therapeutic interaction takes precedence over moral instruction; intimacy is maintained at the cost of authority.\n \n \"Blaming peers and popular culture lets adults off the hook,\" Mr. Weissbourd writes. \"The parent-child relationship is at the center of the development of all the most important moral qualities, including honesty, kindness, loyalty, generosity, a commitment to justice, the capacity to think through moral dilemmas, and the ability to sacrifice for important principles.\"\n\n From a Wall Street Journal review of Weissbourd's book, The Parents We Mean to Be.",
