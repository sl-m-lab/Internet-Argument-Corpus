   "I was watching the news today when I came to realize that the liberals(or democrats if you want to call them that) are just out of control these days. Besides the obvious Howard Dean deal, there are many liberals that are just out of control. One example was Ann Coulter getting a pie thrown at her and liberal students cussing and being disrespectful to her during one of her speechs. Another story was about a person in Texas doing a cheer in the Senate to protest the \"cheerleader bill\". One personal example is when my friend asked a question to Al Sharpton when he spoke one time and the liberal college students with \"Bush is a Wanker\" T-shirts all booed him and started yelling at him. The list could go on and on but you get the point. Now to be fair, there are some conservative nut jobs too but the conservatives don't respect them at all. The liberals however embrace these kind of acts and have shown this by having Howard Dean be their party leader. I honestly have never heard of a conservative throwing a pie at a liberal speaker on campus and if it has it is not nearly as often. Another personal example is when Jame Carville and his wife Mary came to speak. I went to see this and the same group of liberals that were at Al Sharptons speech were at this one. However, many conservatives showed up too and a lot of them showed up with their familes. When the question and answer section started the liberal questions were mean and hateful while the conservative questions were just real questions asked in a civil manner. One kid got up and did a whole speech on his belief about why President Bush is an idiot and then never asked a question. He was told to stop talking but he refused and finally he stopped. Moreover, at the end of the show they started leaving and a liberal kid shot up, went to the mic, and started asking a question EVEN AFTER THEY STARTED LEAVING THE STAGE. I couldn't believe it. These liberals are out of control and this is why they can't win anymore. No one likes a crazy fool.",

   "The thing is, there's never been honor in American politics. In the early 1800's, Aaron Burr was a respected politician yet tried to make his own little rebel country on the Ohio-Mississippi Frontier; the 1820's and 1830's saw some of the most shady dealmaking in Congress ever; in the 1850's, our \"honorable\" politicians got into fistfights on the floors of the House and Senate over the issues of slavery and secession; 1870 - 1920 was the corrupt era; from '32 - '44, Congress only acted as a rubber stamp for King FDR; '44 - '90 was the Good 'Ol Boy Cold War Era; and since '90, it's just been back and forth between Republicans and Democrats because neither party has been able to dominate like in the old days. And all along the way, there have been jackass pundits throwing in their two cents for added flavor. Yeah, some politicans and pundits are more \"upstanding\" than others, but it's only because they know who's back to scratch and which fights to fight.\n \n Still, I don't have a big problem with all that. Politics is a game, a fight, and it's all give and take. It is dirty, but the motives are generally good. Every politician and political thinker wants to better America, and they think they have the plans to do it. They compete, and one/some of the many plans emerge. That's democracy, that's how it's always worked, and that's how it's gonna' be from here to eternity. Watching them all squabble can get a little old, but it's all part of the process.\n \n Remember, there's two things you never want to see being made: law and sausage.",

Nyquist, writing in World Net Daily, recounts how he was told in 1982, when he was still in college, that Bill Clinton was picked to be a \"stealth\" Marxist President. While we welcome this revelation, we will demonstrate that the issue goes far above and beyond Clinton being a Communist. It is much more serious than that.\n\n \n\n \"I first heard of Bill Clinton 16 years ago [1982]. Here is how it happened. I was getting a teaching credential, and one of my classes was on adolescent psychology. The professor in this course, who was a very admirable teacher, seemed to favor me. One day, after class, she invited me to a 7 p.m. meeting at the Science Lecture Hall. At the time I didn't know she was a Marxist, and I didn't know the meeting would be political. She said that if I cared about education in the state of California I would attend. Having the night off from work I decided on going, partly owing to curiosity. Well, I couldn't have been more surprised if it had been a coven of witches. Arriving early at the Science Lecture Hall, I found communist literature -- books and pamphlets -- stacked on tables in the lobby.\"\n \n \"A visiting professor was the speaker. He gave a rousing talk on overthrowing the 'dictatorship of the bourgeoisie' in America. How would this be accomplished? By taking over the Democratic Party through its left wing. The speaker said it was possible to elect a stealth socialist president, who would effect a peaceful transition to socialism during the next great economic down-turn. Capitalism would be unmasked as a bankrupt system. The people would then support a new socialist system. All businesses would be nationalized by the government and run like the Post Office. This socialist president, said the speaker, could be elected in either 1988 or 1992. The only problem was that of timing. When would the next major economic downturn hit?\" [Obviously, this speaker's concept of the requirement for an economic downturn to occur before a \"stealth\" Communist President could be elected was wrong]\n \n \"Some days later I went to visit my professor at her office hours. We talked about the speaker and the book he had written. We talked about Marxism and the idea of changing the system. Then, suddenly, my professor said: 'We have such high hopes for this young Arkansas governor, Bill Clinton'.\"\n\n \n How could I be so blind?\n \n \nhe allowed almost 1 million Rwandans to be murdered without so much as a peep.\n\n So did you.",

   "1. Social Security does not remove personal accountability! Most people pay into social security for their entire lives. It is not something that gives people a free ride, it also is not enough to support a person by itself. I will never make back the money through social security that I pay into it. You could say that it limits my freedom but at the same time any taxes do that. Having it gives me more responsibility toward my nation not a way out of being fiscally responsible and or accountable for my financial state. It is an example of a more liberal idea. In my opinion a good idea. It hasn't been ruled unconstitutional.\n 2. Liberal inspired, a mixed bag but at the same time it can be a help to many people. It can be improved. It hasn't been ruled unconstitutional.\n 3. Actually the federal government gained its first true power from the constitution, seeing the weakness of the articles of confederation. This continued until well after the civil war. But back on topic, the states still have much more say in their curriculum than the federal government, having attended public shool in three different states I can speak from experience.\n 4. I'm sketchy on the details of the prescription plan so pleas excuse my ignorance.\n 5. Considering national healthcare as a concept wasn't even really part of the agenda for the constitutional convention I find it odd that it could be against the spirit of the document. It is also a fairly Left concept but at the same time I believe that no one should be turned down care for life limb or possibly disabling conditions.\n 6. Gun control is unconstitutional but at the same time the founders had no idea about how destructive guns would become. I feel that in order for gun regulations to fit into the actual constitution an amendment would be required. \n 7. Maybe we should go back to dueling over conflicts with each other? emoticon_cool \n 8. Affirmative action was not mentioned by the constitution but at the same time neither was the right to vote for women or blacks until well after the death of the founders.\n 9. Minimum wage laws are also not mentioned in the constitution but at the same time this was before the industrial age was into full swing.\n 10. I don't agree with the patriot act, it does limit personal freedom and you are absolutely correct. Very conservative in nature.\n \n \"The list is endless.

   "Sorry to leave in mid post but I had to head out for a little bit...\n \n It's actually probably a good thing though. Leaving gave me enough time to realize that the charges you lay at the feet of the centrists are in fact really due to the country leaning either left or right depending on the issue. Some I agree with, others I don't but at the same time I don't entirely blame moderates for the stinkers as they were primarily carried by either the right or left.\n \n Moderates and centrists embody the spirit of the constitution which was the compromise between the federalists and the anti federalists. They also embody the flexibility granted by the way the constitution can be changed. The founders knew that they needed a system that could weather and adapt to the changes in our country through the years and in their open mindedness lead to a very enduring document. Had they tried to enforce a more strict code of government it would have certainly failed. \n \n \"The list is endless. All of these unconstitutional programs were instituted with the help of \"centrists\" and bring us closer and closer to a socialist state in which personal accountability and freedom are being supplanted by gov't control and gov't trading of our personal freedom and accountability for security, both fiscal and physical. If that appeals to you, then I would consider you part of the problem. If you find it appalling as I do, then you'd see that \"going along to get along\" is a disasterous philosophy to hold.\n Consider this: If all of your principles are negotiable, are they really prinicples in the first place? \"\n \n I am strong in my beliefs, but at the same time I am not perfect and am capable of being wrong sometimes. So are you. This is why we need to listen and understand why those who disagree with us believe the way they do. Not only does it cause us to really consider our beliefs it allows us to solve conflict between opposing views. It makes us stronger as people and broadens our horizons. You say my principles are negotiable, I say that having an open mind makes them stronger. Coulter and company (left and right) are incapable of admiting it when they are wrong, even when there is no question. They are overconfident, complacent and ignorant to anything but their own point of view. This is why they are wrong, and why they hurt our country.\n \n I could discuss with you point for point every issue and whether or not it was good/bad and whether the moderates are guilty but I stick by my assertion that change is the strong point of the constitution and that these changes good or bad are in the spirit of that change to adapt to the social climate of the country.",

   "Are you saying then that there are some principles you would hold onto regardless of the consequences, however far fetched or extreme they seem?\n\n I don't consider self-reliance, accountability and freedom to be far-fetched and extreme. Sorry.\n \n\n I would say that principles are more just the 'way we wish things would work' than anything set in stone, and anyway, my principles certainly differ from yours (tending toward the socialist aspect of things as I do). The constitution is really just what the original founders would have liked to live by, they themselves would probably have passed various anti-consitutional laws if it made sense to do so at the time. \n\n Since you're in the UK, I don't think that you don't appreciate the reverence that many of us have for the Constitution. It is more than a set of \"suggestions\". It is the wall that separates the US from the rest of the socialist world and the reason that we're the most prosperous nation in the world. It wasn't by accident.\n \n\n The eras are so different then and no I don't really see how it can be held as so important other than as a tool for interpretting the law where there seems a grey area.\n\n Notice that as we become more socialistic, we become more dependent on others and our economy becomes more and more debt-ridden because of our socialistic programs.\n \n\n Course you do need to look critically at the various policies as enough are just made as vote winners and others are just dismissed because the wrong guys came up with them.\n\n Buying votes has become an insidious practice in our modern politics of pragmatism over principle. :xcensored",

This is not unhealthy or cruel. This has been the case throughout history. Measurement of wealth takes on different units at different times in history and in different countries.

I'm sure you might be able to name a few people that worked hard, caught a few breaks, and ended up doing very well for themselves, but for each one of those, countless others struggle to just to maintain what they have, maybe build up a little nest egg, and pass it on to their children. Rarely will they escape the \"middle class\" and even more rarely will they become truly wealthy/privileged.\n\n \n I can count a dozen in my family alone who are self-made millionaires and our grandparents came over from Italy penniless in the early 1900's....and my family's story isn't unique by any stretch of the imagination. The key was education. Italian and Jewish immigrants, particularly, sacrificed greatly to give their kids the best education that money could buy and it paid off.\n \n\n It's not a hard \"caste system\", but those boundaries, \"soft\" boundaries if you will, exist, to deny that is to fool yourself IMHO. \n\n It's not a caste system. It has zero to do with heredity, unless you consider brains inheridited. \n \n\n I'm well aware that I will never, well maybe not never but I am HIGHLY UNLIKELY, to enter the ranks of the truly wealthy and powerful, regardless of what I do, and I was given a major head start on most people simply being being born into the family I was. I don't have illusions about that kind of stuff, there's point to it. \n\n If you came from money, then not attaining wealth is a personal choice, IMO. Unquestionably, having start-up money given to you by \"dad\" can jumpstart the creation of wealth......but it isn't necessary. My mother, for example, is comfortable now, but I don't need her to make my own way.\n \n\n No big deal JP you pompous, greedy, cold-hearted Xtian. ;)\n\n I'll give you ONE of the three, but you'll have to guess which one. :p \n \n\n I just wonder why you insist on posting in that manner, (it doesn't come across as joking or well spirited) when you outright admit that neither label fits? Just to get my goat? emoticon_confused \n\n Yes, and it worked, didn't it? :p I wanted to make sure that you were still awake. \n \n\n At any rate, I think we beat this to death. Besides, I can't even remember what the original topic was anymore. :p \n \n Waxy\n\n \n The original topic wasn't near as much fun as reading the assertion that the US had a caste system while Australia, Canada and the UK, with their monarchs and royalty didn't.",

   "I really do hate to disagree with such a good conservative as yourself, but a caste system is defined in my dictionary to include a societal division based on differences in wealth, inherited rank or privilege, profession, or occupation. Only the primary definition refers to Hinduism.\n \n Technically, we have a caste system. However, it is naturally and not legally imposed.\n\n \n\n caste [Port., casta=basket], ranked groups based on heredity within rigid systems of social stratification, especially those that constitute Hindu India. Some scholars, in fact, deny that true caste systems are found outside India. The caste is a closed group whose members are severely restricted in their choice of occupation and degree of social participation. Marriage outside the caste is prohibited. Social status is determined by the caste of one's birth and may only rarely be transcended. Certain religious minorities may voluntarily constitute a quasi-caste within a society, but they are less apt to be characterized by cultural distinctiveness than by their self-imposed social segregation. A specialized labor group may operate as a caste within a society otherwise free of such distinctions (e.g., the ironsmiths in parts of Africa).

If we mean to talk the talk maybe we should try to walk the walk.\n\n \n I'm sure there are some in the ranks that have some degree of rational thought, but it's apparent that the Democratic party is being controlled by the whacko left.

But, I have to disagree with you wholeheartedly. The conditions of which you speak I feel are a direct result of the social programs that were designed with the supposed intention of pulling the underprivileged out of the muck, when all it's done has increased the numbers and continued the cycle. If the parents of all these children you mention were encouraged to work rather than depend on the government, I'd bet my last dollar the vast majority would not be so underprivileged today. I'm not totally heartless, I feel all these people were duped by the Democrats and it would require a weening off of social programs instead of going cold turkey so to speak. The Democrats are like drug dealers, getting these people dependent on their help for in return for eternal power...pretty sick and callous if you ask me.
