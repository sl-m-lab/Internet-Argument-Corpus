   "\"Two Ben Franklin Middle School students who Valparaiso police said were caught using their cell phones to exchange nude pictures of each other -- a practice called sexual texting or 'sexting' -- are facing criminal charges.\n \n \"A 13-year-old Valparaiso girl and a 12-year-old Valparaiso boy were referred to juvenile probation on charges of possession of child pornography and child exploitation. In adult court, the charges would carry a maximum penalty of 11 years in prison, but prosecutors expect the case to be handled in the juvenile system....\"\n Middle school students charged in 'sexting' case\n \n \n \"At Susquenita High School, 15 miles outside of Harrisburg, Pa., eight students, ranging in age from 13 to 17, have learned a tough lesson about 'sexting.'\n \n \" 'Take a photograph of yourself or somebody else nude and send it to somebody else, you've committed the crime,' said Perry County District Attorney Charles Chenot, who has prosecuted two sexting cases involving a total of 10 minors in the past year.\n \n \"Chenot said he considers sexting a form of child pornography and wants kids to understand once those images are in someone else's hands they could wind up anywhere, even the Internet, possibly forever....\"\n \"Sexting\" Leads to Child Porn Charges for Teens - CBS Evening News - CBS News\n \n I find it strange that a child can be charged with child exploitation for \"exploiting\" himself/herself. What's next? Parents shouldn't be able to take bath time photos of their children because you never know- those photos might end up on the internet where some perv might see them.",
