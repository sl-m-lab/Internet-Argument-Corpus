Again, for the um-teenth time...If homosexuality = death...please explain my son's conception. I'm sure we'd all love to hear your fantasy on that one! \n \n \n \nSometimes it is pointless even arguing; take for example murder that has been legalized in the form of abortion.\n\n \n You know, the that could be said of the Death Penalty as well...but I'm sure that's where you make the exception. \n \n \n It is just an organized crime that is backed by the govenment, this is the true reality.\n\n \n See above\n \n \n Nothing can be seen as wrong, at one time to kill a human being was considered wrong by everyone, but not so anymore, euthanasia is gaining more momentum too, I say that will be legalised soon.\n\n \n Hate to remind you, but it already is...it's called the Death Penalty.\n \n \n What chance does any homosexual have of being convinced that homosexuality is wrong?\n\n \n Not a whole heck of a lot, I can tell you that. At least not when approached in the insulting and completely inane way you do it! \n \n \n Even when there is no benefit for it and that it is a very risky thing to do unprotected.\n\n \n Life is risky, when done unprotected. \n Besides, that's exactly what we homosexuals are fighting for...PROTECTIONS!!! Welcome to the human race! \n \n \n Image the consequences of this in many years to come, AIDS is only increasing, it is never going to show signs of abating.\n\n \n Well not when straight men continue to go to hookers and demand \"bareback\", not when drug addicts continue to share needles, not when homophobics keep spreading the misinformation that AIDS is only a gay disease...no it won't stop. \n Because HIV is a virus, viruses don't care who they infect, they don't care about their victims race, religion, ethnic background, age or even what flavor of bubblegum you chew...to the virus, you are a welcoming host! IT DOESN'T CARE!!! \n \n \n Open your eyes, be honest to yourself, give yourself what you deserve, you are on the road to death unless you turn things around.\n\n \n Speak for yourself! \n Quit being so preoccupied with the splinter in my eye, when you have that huge plank in your own!",

Only when you are willing and able to discuss sexual intercourse in a mature and clinical way, are you capable of engaging in dialogue about safe sex. \n \n Unprotected oral sex, cunnilingus or fellatio, are both low risk activities.

Proper use of a condom is necessary for this level of protection, and unfortunately there are still people who don't know how to use them properly. \n \n Unprotected anal sex, like unprotected vaginal sex, is much more dangerous in terms of HIV transmission, as well as for a host of other STDs.

   "So then am I to assume you agree that the easiest way to catch HIV is through anal intercourse?\n No, I'd say that the easiest way to catch HIV is sharing a needle with an HIV infected person. \n \n The second easiest way, I'd say, is vaginal penetration. This is because some straight people, for whatever reason, think of HIV as something that only gays get. And, naturally, there are lots more straight people to engage in risky sexual behaviour like unprotected sex with strangers. Look at the whole of Africa, or Brazil for example, and you'll see that most people there are being infected through unprotected vaginal intercourse. \n \n Unprotected anal intercourse with an HIV infected person is less or more risky depending on whether you're penetrating or being penetrated respectively. \n \n Getting HIV from penetrating someone anally without protection is somewhat less risky than the chance of contracting HIV from being penetrated vaginally, as I understand these things.\n \n Protected anal sex is safer than unprotected vaginal sex, and roughly on par with unprotected oral sex. I say roughly because the risk of contracting HIV through oral sex depends very much on the state of each partner's oral and genital health - sores and open wounds significantly increase risk.\n \n Performing unprotected oral sex on someone with lesions on their genitals, for example, is much more dangerous than protected anal sex.\n \n I guess my point is that anal sex is more or less risky than other forms of sex depending on how and with who it's being performed. Very gentle anal penetration with a condom, good lube, and lots of foreplay is considerably less risky than rough unprotected vaginal penetration, for example. \n \n Anal sex with an uninfected person, also, is far less risky than just about any kind of sex with an infected person. You can't contract HIV from someone who doesn't have it. \n \n Another point is condom use - a 'female' condom, for example, is much safer for anal and vaginal use than regular condoms for a variety of reasons - resistant to most lube (doesn't corrode like latex), reduces friction on the receiver, and shifts control of protection to the more vulnerable party. \n \n One of the problems with HIV in Africa is that many heterosexual men are unwilling to wear condoms, but equally unwilling to forego sex or allow their partners the right of refusal.",

   "What about having sex the old fashioned way; between a man and a woman; the way God intended sex to be conducted? What's wrong with that?\n I think you're confusing sex with reproduction. This may surprise you but quite a few homosexuals procreate in the 'old fashioned way'. \n \n The objection is that unlike sex for purpose of procreation, sex for the sake of expressing love, having a good time, working off stress, and emotional bonding cannot be done if you're not sexually attracted to someone. This applies equally to everyone, heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or asexual. \n \n Sex, for purposes other than procreation, with someone you're not attracted to, whether it's because they're the wrong gender, or just plain unattractive to you, is a waste of time. \n \n Maybe that's just my experience of it. Personally I don't even see the point of sex with someone I don't love and care for (my partner). \n \n Leaving out the theological issue of how we are to know what God did and did not intend, homosexuals tend to object to sex with people of the opposite sex in much the manner that heterosexuals tend to object to sex with people of the same gender - they're repulsed by the idea.\n \n So unless you're gritting your teeth and taking one for the team, sex with someone outside of your sexual orientation cannot achieve its purpose.\n \n Missouri Mule: This may surprise you, but sex isn't a medical procedure (thank God). I've had a colonoscopy and anal sex, and they're two different things that just happen to have to do with your XXX. It's a bit like comparing a trip to the dentist with a kiss.",

   "Something I found out a couple of years back is that there's apparently this thing called \"The Gay Lifestyle\". Apparently you have to be really slutty, do lots of drugs, hang out with *******s, and be more flamboyant than the caricatures on 'XXXXX Eye'. I can't say that I recognize this as my 'lifestyle', or as that of any other gays and lesbians I care to associate with. \n \n Sure, there are gays like this. But why do I, and gays like me, have to be lumped in with them? Can't I get on with loving my partner and raising my family without being taken for a crystal-queen? \n \n Isn't it time that people acknowledged the fact that there is no such thing as \"The Gay Lifestyle\"?\n\n \n This is my first post here so I am gonna try to be thought provoking :) \n \n I am gay, I am not slutty (anymore, but I have my moments), I don't do a lot of drug (again, my past is a different story), I probably don't hang out with *******s (I can't tell what that was censoring), BUT I am the biggest queen to walk the earth and you better believe it. I am living MY OWN gay lifestyle. I don't care how other live theirs, that is their business.\n \n However, I am sick and tired of this culture war going on in the gay community. The Flammers hate the \"Straight-Acting\" because theythink they demean the community and the \"Straight Acting\" hate the flammers because they think they are embarassing stereotypes. Guess what? Our enemies don't care how we differentiat ourselves, they hate us all the same. so how about sticking together for a change and show solidarity rather than diviciveness. mean while the lesbians are having a great laugh at the gay male community.\n \n So what can we do to stop this Femme vs. Butch, Party Boy Vs. Homebody war that we have going on? well for starters we need to recognize the things that each side has given to the community as a whole.\n \n Flammers basically jumpstarted the whole gay civil right movement. They were the ones on the front lines at Stonewall, the ones fighting Anita Blake. Meanwhile the \"Straight Acting\" were content to blend in with the background and carry on their live in secret. The flammers just wanted to live how they wanted to and act how they really were.\n \n The \"Straight Acting\" give a \"pallatable\" face to the rest of the world, they are the ones who say \"Hey! we are just like you!\" the ones that our legislators need to see on a daily basis. With out the \"Straight Acting\" the gay community would have been burned at the stake 20 years ago.\n \n Niether side can survive alone, it is a checks and balances system.\n \n Ok I am going to be blunt, Nurglitch, it is what I am best at. I honestly think you need to take a step back and revaluate what it is exactly you are saying. \n \nI can't say that I recognize this as my 'lifestyle', or as that of any other gays and lesbians I care to associate with. \n\n Are you saying that you don't have any friends who are flamboyant or are you saying that you refuse to be friend with any flamboyant gays?\n \n The latter attitude is the by far the worst one a gay person can take because it automatically drives a wedge into a community that is very volitile to begin with. We need to stand together, \"Straight Acting\", Flammer, Butch, Femme, Bear, Twink, Club Kid, Homebody, All of us and defend ourselve together against those that would do us harm. Expounding upon how you don't like being lumped in with another group of people who happen to be in the same community as you, who have the same goals as you is not going to make you stand out any more. In fact it makes it worse because it creates wedges. \n \n \nSure, there are gays like this. But why do I, and gays like me, have to be lumped in with them? Can't I get on with loving my partner and raising my family without being taken for a crystal-queen? \n\n \n If you don't want to be labled as someone you are not then it is YOUR responisblity to actively seek to change how you are percieved, I am sorry, but chatting on an internet forum is not going to do much to change anyone's mind. You need to get out there and show the world, not how you are better than the stereotypes, but how you are different. Do not deride anyone for their PERSONAL lifestyles, because someone could just as easily turn those same arguments back at you. Get out there, be active in your community, talk to you representitives, be active in the local chuch, what ever it is, DO IT! Show them that THEIR narrow minded stereotypes are wrong, rather that demean other gays for asspects you don't like.\n \n \n\n Isn't it time that people acknowledged the fact that there is no such thing as \"The Gay Lifestyle\"?\n\n \n There IS a \"Gay Lifestyle\", infact there are millions of them, there are as many \"Gay Lifestyles\" as their are gays, lesbians, etc. every gay expresses the same sexual orientation in a different way, none any lesser than any other.\n \n \n God This is a long post, sorry if I bored you guys. as you can see I am very opinionated and passionate about this issue because as someone who tends to be on the Femme side of things I get lots of flak for being a \"Stereotype\" when in reality I am just being me.",

   "I think you're confusing sex with reproduction. This may surprise you but quite a few homosexuals procreate in the 'old fashioned way'. \n \n The objection is that unlike sex for purpose of procreation, sex for the sake of expressing love, having a good time, working off stress, and emotional bonding cannot be done if you're not sexually attracted to someone. This applies equally to everyone, heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or asexual. \n \n Sex, for purposes other than procreation, with someone you're not attracted to, whether it's because they're the wrong gender, or just plain unattractive to you, is a waste of time. \n \n Maybe that's just my experience of it. Personally I don't even see the point of sex with someone I don't love and care for (my partner). \n \n Leaving out the theological issue of how we are to know what God did and did not intend, homosexuals tend to object to sex with people of the opposite sex in much the manner that heterosexuals tend to object to sex with people of the same gender - they're repulsed by the idea.\n \n So unless you're gritting your teeth and taking one for the team, sex with someone outside of your sexual orientation cannot achieve its purpose.\n \n Missouri Mule: This may surprise you, but sex isn't a medical procedure (thank God). I've had a colonoscopy and anal sex, and they're two different things that just happen to have to do with your XXX. It's a bit like comparing a trip to the dentist with a kiss.\n\n \n There is no confusion here. I didn't say a word about procreation. I just find the idea of two males having anal sex to be abhorant. It's gross; its dirty, and it potentially is fatal. If you will recall, Aids did not originate from normal heterosexual sex. And who in the heck can condone \"bare backing?\" How sick is that?",

   "Quid, to make some things clearer...\n \nOk I am going to be blunt, Nurglitch, it is what I am best at. I honestly think you need to take a step back and revaluate what it is exactly you are saying.\n That's good advice, because apparently it wasn't clear enough. This thread is directed to those outside of the gay community who want to picture us as some sort of regimented organization, rather than the loose association of individuals that we are. \n \n I could care less how anyone in the gay community wants to express themself. What I do care about is people outside of that community being narrow-minded enough to stereotype us. \n \n If people want to complain about my 'lifestyle' then they can complain about my lifestye and not the one they imagine I lead thanks to whatever stereotypes they have of the gay community.\n \nAre you saying that you don't have any friends who are flamboyant or are you saying that you refuse to be friend with any flamboyant gays?\n I'm saying that the 'lifestyle' I and many other gays are painted as having isn't our lifestyle. \n \n But yes, now that you mention it, I find really flamboyant queens really dull and boorish people, much like I find jocks, yuppies, hippies, and other attention-whores dull and boorish. \n \n So I'm not friends with any particularly flamboyant people, unless those people are also introspective, thoughtful, and capable of being calm and relaxed for a few hours without the use of drugs. Since these people are few and far between, only three.\n \nIf you don't want to be labled as someone you are not then it is YOUR responisblity to actively seek to change how you are percieved, I am sorry, but chatting on an internet forum is not going to do much to change anyone's mind.\n Gee, y'think? I come here to amuse myself when I should be working, and spend enough of my everyday life disabusing people of gay stereotypes. \n \n On the other hand, when I come online to chat about this sort of thing with people like Voice of Reason, I find that occasionally I need to point that out so that we can have a constructive discussion. \n \nThere IS a \"Gay Lifestyle\", infact there are millions of them, there are as many \"Gay Lifestyles\" as their are gays, lesbians, etc. every gay expresses the same sexual orientation in a different way, none any lesser than any other.\n Here's a lesson - \"The Gay Lifestyle\" is an expression denoting a single lifestyle. Notice the use of the definitive article. Yes, there is a (notice the indefinite article denoting plural 'lifestyles') 'lifestyle' for each and every gay person on earth, much like there is a 'lifestyle' for each and every person on earth. Given that each gay person has their own particular 'lifestyle' then it follows that there is no particular 'lifestyle' in which all gay people participate.\n \n However there are certainly people whose lifestyles are worse than others. I don't really rank the lifestyle of some crystal-addled club-kid as good or valuable as that of a hard-working doctor who puts in extra hours at the local clinic. \n \nGod This is a long post, sorry if I bored you guys. as you can see I am very opinionated and passionate about this issue because as someone who tends to be on the Femme side of things I get lots of flak for being a \"Stereotype\" when in reality I am just being me.\n If you're going to be opinionated and passionate, please read people's posts more carefully in future so you can answer intelligently as well.

If you will recall, Aids did not originate from normal heterosexual sex. And who in the heck can condone \"bare backing?\" How sick is that?\n The problem is that people's abhorrence of particular sex acts is beside the point - the fact that you find it gross, and that other people find it sexy, is just a particular aesthetic opinion. And our aesthetic opinions are, fortunately, merely our opinions and have no moral standing.\n \n As for being dirty, it's about as dirty as you want to make it. You do know how to wash yourself, right? \n \n And potentially fatal? Any kind of sex is potentially fatal if people are in a risk situation and don't protect themselves adequately. Where that risk exists though, risk also exists for vaginal and oral sex. \n \n I have to agree with you that bare-backing is a problem - mainly because of our socialized health care here in Canada that makes any adverse health effects the business of me, the taxpayer. \n \n But then there are people out there (hetero and homo) who have different values from both of us and consider the pleasure they derive from it to outweigh the risk involved. Besides, unless it affects more than the two people involved, why should whatever two consenting adults decide to do in private be our business? \n \n I'm curious about your claim of where AIDS originated.

For a brief moment in the early 70s (perhaps even earlier), gay people were trying to get the public to understand that being gay wasn't just about a sex act. They were trying to get folks to understand that being gay was about love, about your life relationships, about your lifestyle. I distinctly remember someone on some Oprah-like show explaining that it was a lifestyle. They didn't mean dancing till dawn or wearing leather.\n \n Unfortunately, the phrase has been taken by the right and is now used as code for all the things they think are icky about us (including quite a few they just went and dreamed up). \n \n As for taking it back, well, I'm not sure it's worth that fight, since it really doesn't mean anything, and society is past the idea that being gay is like some sort of occasionally indulged in bad habit (well, most of society). To \"take it back\" but have it mean nothing more profound than that all gay people are attracted to members of their own sex seems pointless.",

This epidemiological study showed how 'Patient O' (mistakenly identified in the press as 'Patient Zero') had given HIV to multiple partners, who then in turn transmitted it to others and rapidly spread the virus to locations all over the world. A journalist, Randy Shilts, subsequently wrote an article based on Darrow's findings, which named Patient Zero as a gay Canadian flight attendant called Gaetan Dugas. For several years, Dugas was vilified as a 'mass spreader' of HIV and the original source of the HIV epidemic among gay men. However, four years after the publication of Shilts' article, Dr. Darrow repudiated his study, admitting its methods were flawed and that Shilts' had misrepresented its conclusions.\n \n While Gaetan Dugas was a real person who did eventually die of AIDS, the Patient Zero story was not much more than myth and scaremongering.\n \n http://www.avert.org/origins.htm",
