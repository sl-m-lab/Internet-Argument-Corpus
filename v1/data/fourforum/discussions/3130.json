   "Washington State Gay Marriage Ban Ruled Unconstitutional \n \n Olympia, Washington) A second judge has ruled that Washington state's ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. \n \n A Thurston County judge ruled Tuesday that the state's 1998 Defense of Marriage Act violates the civil liberties of gays and lesbians under the Washington constitution. \n \n \"For the government this is not a moral issue. It is a legal issue,\" Thurston County Superior Court Judge Richard Hicks said in a written ruling. \n Hicks acknowledged that the intent of the state's 1998 Defense of Marriage Act was very clear: Legislators wanted to limit marriage to a union between one man and one woman. But, Hicks said, that law directly conflicts with the state constitution.\n \n \"What fails strict scrutiny here is a government-approved civil contract for one class of the community not given to another class of the community,\" Hicks wrote. \"Democracy means people with different values living together as one people. What can reconcile our differences is the feeling that with these differences we are still one people. This is the democracy of conscience.\" \n The case was brought by 11 gay and lesbian couples from across the state. \n \n The decision is the second victory for supporters of gay marriage in Washington state. A King County judge ruled in favor of gay marriage rights in a separate case last month. (story) \n \n Both cases will now go to the state Supreme Court, where they will likely be consolidated.\n \n \u00a9365Gay.com 2004\n \n \n \n http://www.365gay.com/newscon04/09/090704waMarr.htm",

Politicians are held accountable by their constituents, and so often make laws based on a current whim of the mob. Judges make their rulings based on the rule of law. Important decisions get made by a panel of judges, to help eliminate the potential for bias getting in the way. The basic idea here is that just because a law was legally adopted, doesn't make it morally correct. It's the judge's job to try to strike down laws that don't meet certain standards, as spelled out in the state's constitution.",

People used the bible to justify why a black man shouldn't marry a white women. Just like jaaman is doing. In the end the majority of people now think that is crazy. In ten or so years people will not believe gays couldn't marry at one time. Gay rights are civil rights. The relgious beliefs of some should not dictate to those that do not believe in those rules how we live our lives and who we love.\n In some coutries religion dictates that gays should be out to death based on their god's laws.

These gender concepts of masculine and feminine are about more than one's sex organ or the sex organ of one's partner, different or same. Gender occurs in one's own head. However, I think you are arguing for dictated gender roles here. Is there some reason we shouldn't question those roles, as it relates to homosexuality or anything else, other than we just shouldn't think for ourselves?",

   "Jaaaman: \n As much as I really do respect your right to your religious views, I must ask that you respect mine. I do not believe the way you do, but I am no less spiritual. To assume so devalues all religions. \n What I also must do is to rein in your insistence on religious views over legal views. Your religious views here have not allowed for the idea that other religions may not agree with your views. To insist that a nations laws coincide with one religious viewpoint is in effect theocratic. It goes against everything this country was actually based on. Democracy and religious tollerence. If you expect me to tollerate your religious ideals, I insist you tollerate mine. In this case, my religious beliefs do not abhor gay marriage let alone gay sexual activities. My God did create me exactly as I am. Your idea of God did not. But your expectance that our nation's laws reflect your beliefs over mine is an infringement of great porportions.\n\n This kind of statement is the logical progression for a society that no longer understands what truth is. A generation ago, this was not only unthinkable, it was \"un-thinked\" (if I can invent such a word!).\n At one time, society knew what truth was. Some might not have liked it, but they knew what it was. Now, however, we live under an entirely different set of circumstances.\n As a society, we must find our way back to truth.",

Now, however, we live under an entirely different set of circumstances.\n As a society, we must find our way back to truth.\n\n \n Jaaaman: \n To \"find our way back\" is going against humanity in general. As a species we evolve, we learn, we grow. As societies go, they must also grow or perish. Societies and governments which are unable to allow for growth will ultimately destroy themselves. \n Societies cannot take one step foreward and twelve steps back and survive. \n Yes, we do live under an entirely different set of circumstances. Technology has done a lot of this. It allows us to communicate even now. With people whom we have never met, exchange ideas and learn from eachother's experiences. \n Personally I find that a miracle! A wonderous achievement of which we all should be grateful. \n Jaaaman, even you enjoy these advances. If you want to \"find [your] way back to truth\" I suggest you practice what you preach and be the first to set the example. Remove your computer, radio, television, cell phones, microwave oven and anything that has been invented within the past 150yrs, try it for a while, see just what you are so upset about and then come back here and tell us what you've learned from that experience.\n I bet you can already imagine just how 'inconvenient' your life will become. Chores which you and your family take for granted will become the center of attention because they will take exhorbinant amounts of time to get done. Getting to work will be an expedition not just an inconvenient commute. Washing your scrubs will be an all week task for you or your wife. etc etc etc...you get the idea.\n \n So, tell me exactly what is \"truth\" now? \n The truth is that we all grow, we all learn, we all reap the benefits of these things. Just look at overtly regligious communities and tell me just how well they are doing. Look at the Memonites, Amish and Shakers. They are all dieing out because they can't compete in an ever changing world. Societies must grow along with progresses of technologies to survive.",
