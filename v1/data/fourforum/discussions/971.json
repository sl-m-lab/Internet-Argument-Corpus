The link you provided requests a limit on how long a movie can be kept before it must be deleted. It would also be nice if they made available movies in sizes close to 650MB, 700MB, 1200-1300MB, and 1300-1400MB so that they can best be fit onto one or more CD-ROMs while being of the highest quality possible under the size limitations of CD-ROMs.",

They can take advantage of the Internet and make it really convenient for everyone but instead they oppose it. So what happens? Internet users start opening up sites that do what the industry should be doing themselves only they do it free of charge. Then the industry begins to punish those who take advantage of the service that they should be providing. And of course this pushes some buyers that the industry should have had away as they now see the industry as both backwards and a legal bully.\n \n The video industry should wake up and just being providing this Internet service themselves before video P2P really picks up as it has with the music industry.",

   "Why would the movie companies want to spend a ton of money on bandwidth when they can just pump out cheap DVDs with 1/100 the risk of illegal copyright violations?\n\n \n The video industry is lucky in this way actually. When music is ripped from a CD it is possible to get it in perfect CD quality with a fairly low file size. Ripping a movie off a DVD results in a substancially lower quality video, the sound is worse, and burning it to CD will not allow you to play it in a DVD player. So even if the video industry allowed people to download movies I think buying them on DVD would be common.\n \n I don't think the video industry is taking a risk at this point. You can anyone with a DVD player on their computer can make it possible for people to make illegal copies of movies and the P2P sharing programs allow the entire world to access these movies. Not everyone does this today and not everyone would do this if the movie industry did start selling them online. I don't know if it would make the problem worse or not. For my opinion though, I would much prefer to pay for these movies at a reasonable cost over a legal site but the movie industry just hasn't made that possible yet.",
