   "This board was dying so I thought I'd throw something up here.\n \n http://www.creationsafaris.com/crev0704.htm\n \n Ah, they bring up the controversial Pre-Cambrian bilateral beasts! Yes, they are controversial, because some think they are simply mineral formations and others think that they are fossils. The rest of the discussion about how long the Cambrian explosion took is funny. I love it when creationists talk about evolution in an entirely evolutionary context. They dispute certain claims and offer up only modified evolutionary claims, not strictly creationist claims (ie, genesis kinds.)\n \n I like this quote:\n \"Parasitic Worms Regulate Immune System 07/13/2004\n Most people will not be ready to stomach a suggestion from the July 9 issue of Science1: parasitic worms can be good for you. Yikes: what's next- worm therapy?\"\n \n Yes! http://ibd.patientcommunity.com/features/weinstock.cfm\n \n \n http://www.creationsafaris.com/ :)\n \n This site is great. Visit the great outdoors!\n \"And while you're at it, you will learn important evidence for creation and against evolution.\"\n \n Well I don't know if anyone want to argue about the Cambrian Explosion or helminthic therapy, but if you do, holla....",

   "Wait a minute, this one is much more interesting to debate:\n \n \"Is Earth's Magnetic Field Reversing? 07/13/2004\n The New York Times and World Net Daily have stories about Earth's magnetic field. The strength of the field has declined 10-15% over the past 150 years. If undergoing a reversal, which some physicists say is overdue, it could have profound effects on migratory animals like birds and turtles, and allow more dangerous radiation to hit the Earth's surface. New satellites are trying to get better measurements of the collapse of the field. During a reversal, the field strength drops to zero, then rebounds in the other direction, such that compass needles would point south.\n \n The important thing in these stories is not the long-age claims, which are not subject to calibration without long-age assumptions, but the fact that an objectively measured physical parameter shows a steep and steady decline over 150 years. This challenges the belief that it has been around for billions of years (see 03/04/2003 headline).\n Scientists do not understand how planets generate magnetic fields. Why is Earth the only rocky planet with a strong field? Why are those of Uranus and Neptune so erratic? Saturn explodes the most popular dynamo models by possessing a strong field without an angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic field axis (the divergence is only 0.2%). The new measurements of Saturn's magnetosphere by the Cassini spacecraft should prove interesting.\n Another important thing to know is that life depends on the protective bubble provided by Earth's magnetic field (see 05/10/2002 headline). Better hope the collapse doesn't occur during your beach vacation. \"\n \n Scientist don't know 100% what creates the magnetic field of planets because they have never been to the core. But we are pretty certain than the Earth has a magnetic field because of its molten iron core, within which turbulence causes the magnetic field. Ah! and don't be mislead. Life may depend on the magnetic field like I depend on my car, but I do not need my car to survive. I don't even know what point they are trying to make with this one. Also, in what way would measuring a decline in field strength over 150 years have to do with its presence for billions of years? Anyone care to explain it to me?",

   "I'm sorry. I just can't get over this site:\n \n http://www.creationsafaris.com/crevbd.htm\n \n Use your Baloney Detector to find:\n \n \"Circular Reasoning (begging the question, special pleading, petitio principii, a priori reasoning)\n Definition: Assuming what needs to be proved.\n Catch-phrase: Horoscopes prove astrology.\n Examples: Tautologies (boys will be boys, a rose is a rose, it's not over till it's over, 4 - 2 = 9 - 7, deafness is caused by hearing loss, nothing succeeds like success, we have nothing to fear but fear itself, the meaning of life is to live a life of meaning, etc.): Natural Selection translates into survival of the survivors or the fitness of the fit. Using index fossils to date the rock layers, and then using the rock layers to date the fossils they contain. Using homology both as explanation of evolution and proof for it. Using the geologic column as descriptive of evolution and also as evidence for it Assuming long ages for radioactive half-lives, then using them to prove long ages. Inventing a term as if it explains something: e.g., convergent evolution used as an explanation and an evidence for a Darwinian origin of like characteristics in unlike organisms. Cohen's Law: What really matters is the name you succeed in imposing on the facts &#65533; not the facts themselves.\"\n \n This is awesome. Yes, NS translates precisely to survival of the survivors and the fitness of the fit! Those who do not pass on their genes do not contribute to the next generation. Pretty circular if you ask me. \n \n They left out Intelligent Design: It's so complex that I can't understand how it could have happened by evolution, it must be designed, case closed. Would this be a case of inventing a term as if it explains something? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Please someone defend this site! I can't just argue with myself, can I?",

   "You guys just don't understand science. Why, just this morning I was at the beach in Galveston. When we arrived the water was almost to the sea wall. I placed my chair in the sand so that the waves washed over my feet, smeared on the sun screen, and took out my book and began to read. A chapter later I looked at my watch. 1/2 hour had passed. When I looked up I found that the water was several feet away. In fact, a bikini clad nymph was laying on a towel between me and the water. I was puzzled. Being a mountain boy who grew up where shore lines only change as a result of earth quakes, I couldn't imagine why the water was so far away. I had felt no earth quake. While gazing at the bikini clad nymph was pleasant, I picked up my chair and moved to the water's edge where it again washed over my feet. I again took up my book. After another chapter I looked up again. Yet again the water was several feet away. This time there were children with plastic shovels and buckets working on a sand castle. Even though the sight of happy children at play was also pleasant (in a totally different way), I again moved my chair to the water's edge and took up my book. Again I looked up after a chapter and again found the the water was several feet away. This time the sight of a blimp of a man (over 300 lbs) stirred me to action. My acute scientific mind kicked in. I paced off distances, measured angles, and calculated water levels. I calculated that only two days before the water was over the sea wall. And yet, there were no signs of flooding of the city beyond. The only conclusion possible is that the entire city was created ex nihlio two days ago. Even though some buildings appeared to be hundreds of years old, the creator being wanted them to appear so, complete with odd routings of plumbing and electrical fixtures. And these buildings are intermixed with others with invisible plumbing and electrical fixtures of quite modern design. The almighty creator is wondrous, is he not? Only a couple of days ago he created a whole city with not only the apearance of age, but the apearance of an old established city that has changed through the years.\n \n I'm still working on the calculations as to how long ago other cities were flooded. New Orleans was created some days before Galveston. Houston was created only a few weeks ago. Dallas no more than a couple of months. I'm working on the age of Denver.\n \n You guys just have to pay attention to how science is really done.",
