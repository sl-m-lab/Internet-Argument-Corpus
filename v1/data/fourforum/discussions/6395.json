   "A cup of Casbanca-prose-by cauchy3.\n \n \n Laws propellers and ways promoters are social engines but they are all thrusters. Beneath stars Canis majors have fangs. Pets are minor. Soldiers and officials are major. Your fellowships make you feel near to loll.\n \n Was the desserts are deserted salads? Who can control the hours in your times. Making magic in your lives is a mark on political files.\n \n Stick to dip is a dipper to a cup of coffee-Casbanca.\n Good bye! Good pinko.\n Back off bad pinko.\n Latter posted prints are stirred. Who kick the rock on big sands? Pretty lives are not graceful. Who wash your shames by our bloods?\n Sandy winds in Tibet are not snow white.\n Malaysia stands while Singapore is not kneeling.'\n Laws are orders in annexes. Movements of shadows are bows to sparrows. Mnemonic of their bloods are your white washes. Secrets of hade are dogs to live and to serve with snakes.\n Colds firns go into tills but who think about the colds. Drag the legend heroes in the century that is the corpses of fiscal policy. Hong Kong step on step exercises.\n Empire buildings are with outer fronts, inside middles and back halls.\n Empire buildings are not building to live but success realms and symbols of king crafts.\n If Raffeel coughs may I give him a cup of Casbanca. While Donlad got the blue taps besides a pack of potato chips.\n Good touch of powers is a complete political grappler. Behind schedules are your behind hands. Who own you a cup of Casbenca.\n Front of the empire building are three rows and three columns with altogether 9 switches. The off sets are morals, beauties, laws, friendships, peaces, dignities, justices, honors and honest.\n The sets are still the above nine but all add with buying and selling.\n All selling and buying are to conquer our enemies.\n The middle layers contain many layers of rows and columns. Among them the main hubs have one all inputs and all outputs. The inputs are our private lives and the outputs are public lives.\n For the back halls there are a secret hub, it is....\n The devices are country resources, army resources and logistic resources with many kinds of talents. Of course there are many toggle switches.\n The difference on off and set is buying and selling..\n Two lateral sides of the empire buildings are policies and political airs.\n Our political breezes or winds are wings for rocs.\n The themes are to regard the peoples as elements. However all political issues lay stress on how to function. My mot is abnormal acquire abnormal powers. So there give birth to masochisms and sadisms by Gods apples.\n My Donuts may you feel near to loll. I give you a cup of Casbenca with butters.\n Wahoo are not symbols or actualities. Mirrors are different from the stage of plantains. All will be removed and all are naught.\n What is our soil or your souls? The words count to Wu kin Taio, Wein Kam poo and Tseng Qing Hong. Are you all on games? Toss up a cup of casbenca.\n Wu Kin Taio and Wein Kam poo get their successes by polish the swords of armies and generals to drag two of them on thrones. They feel near to loll while devils sleep.\n Chan Shi Bein get the successes by return tickets from the public to drag Chan on musical chairs.\n Cherry blossom blot out the old trees which have devils tails. Who take all responsibilities to the china liabilities? Our soils and Wu s souls! What are their principals?\n The scorched Mao s suns wash your dimensions on faces of histories with bleached heats. A cup of Casbenca.!\n Times have daggers to pin the political bad men on evils posts. Will bad men are bat men.\n --------Cheung Shun Sang=Cauchy3--------",
