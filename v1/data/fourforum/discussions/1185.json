By deploying military units in space the US is going to set itself up to be seen as an aggressor the world would not accept. It would either lead to a cold war and space race against the EU which would massively hurt the US economy or it would spark a war. Either way there is not a good risk-reward ratio for the US in creating a space defense. I don't doubt that the people of the US could be supportive of the step but even that is hampered if the rest of the world threatens war against the US over it. It is not an internal issue, it is an international one.",

Most of what you find is based on the Regan era or will be content of some wild conspiracy theory website that'll tell you the government is run by aliens.

I was merely stating that it is a fact and it's not just for nuclear missile defense. \n \n Who do you think put the missile defense satellites in space?

   "Weapons in space would have one goal. They would be like nuclear missles, created in the hopes of making war such a horrible possiblity no one would dare challenge the U.S., the only problem is if the U.S. tryed anything like that, world war 3 would break out. With weapons in space, espiciailly using those chemically generated lasers, could eliminte missle threats to the U.S., make naval and land assualts impossible and create nearly ultimite power (for the person controlling the grid of weapons). \n \n Any body could be dead, no collarorial damage. No fuss, no muss, just clean, efficent and exact. I got to agree with the guy who said the world won't stand for it, and they were right. If ever the U.S. started unilaterially building a \"defensive\" grid (agiasnt the boogy alien I suppose) in space, the U.S. would be hit with so many econmic santions, and if those didn't work the worlds ICBM stockpiles.",
