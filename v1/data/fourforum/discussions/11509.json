   "My question is, in light of the fact that we have mobile missile technology from Air and Sea platforms, or already existing stationary missile systems in Germany which can hit virtually anyplace in Russia already, why are we raising tension levels by setting a scenario for another Cuban missile type crisis. The obvious counter move for Russia would be to make a deal to place their own missile system as close to the US as possible in order to force a showdown which will cause us to withdraw our system from Poland. \n \n This seems foolish and shortsighted at a time when tensions are already so high in Eastern Europe and we don't need this site for strategic purposes at all in this high tech age. \n US, Poland OK missile defense base, riling Moscow\n \n By VANESSA GERA and MONIKA SCISLOWSKA, Associated Press Writers &#8211; Wed Aug 20, 6:09 pm ET\n \n AFP &#8211; US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski (R) exchange documents &#8230;\n WARSAW, Poland &#8211; The United States and Poland signed a deal Wednesday to place a U.S. missile defense base just 115 miles from Russia &#8212; a move followed swiftly by a new warning from Moscow of a possible military response.\n For many Poles &#8212; whose country has been a staunch U.S. ally &#8212; the accord represented what they believed would be a guarantee of safety for themselves in the face of a newly assertive Russia.\n Negotiators sealed the deal last week against a backdrop of Russian military action in Georgia, a former Soviet republic turned U.S. ally, that has worried former Soviet satellites across eastern Europe. It prompted Moscow's sharpest rhetoric yet over the system, which it contends is aimed at Russia despite Washington's insistence the site is purely defensive.http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080820/ap_on_re_eu/poland_us_missile_defense;_ylt=AoKtKn63iizgk1w6Xi5rWjp0bBAF",

   "Now this is what I'm talking about. Placing military hardware in Eastern Europe isn't the most intelligent way to bring about peace and a spirit of compromise to the region. Especially since Russia is showing expansionist tendencies lately, and acting extremely insecure. \n Russia: Poland risks attack because of US missiles\n By JIM HEINTZ\n MOSCOW A top Russian general said Friday that Poland's agreement to accept a U.S. missile interceptor base exposes the ex-communist nation to attack, possibly by nuclear weapons, the Interfax news agency reported.\n \n The statement by Gen. Anatoly Nogovitsyn is the strongest threat that Russia has issued against the plans to put missile defense elements in former Soviet satellite nations.\n \n Poland and the United States on Thursday signed a deal for Poland to accept a missile interceptor base as part of a system the United States says is aimed at blocking attacks by rogue nations. Moscow, however, feels it is aimed at Russia's missile force.\n \n \"Poland, by deploying (the system) is exposing itself to a strike - 100 percent,\" Nogovitsyn, the deputy chief of staff, was quoted as saying.\n \n He added, in clear reference to the agreement, that Russia's military doctrine sanctions the use of nuclear weapons \"against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them.\" Nogovitsyn that would include elements of strategic deterrence systems, he said, according to Interfax.\n \n At a news conference earlier Friday, Nogovitsyn had reiterated Russia's frequently stated warning that placing missile-defense elements in Poland and the Czech Republic would bring an unspecified military response. But his subsequent reported statement substantially stepped up a war of words.http://www.tri-cityherald.com/917/story/277086.html",

   "Along the lines of what OC said.\n \n However, as someone who sees the progression of this type of thing, proceeding 'generations' of such technology gets better due to the R&D investments while a lagging civilization (like Russia or Iran) can't hope to increase their technology to even compete.\n \n We also get occasional trickel down gadgets from such research, or find alternative paths that do th job when the 1st path failed. \n \n There's also little reason to believe most of Russias missiles even work anymore due to lack of maintenance and cannabalism of command materials. if you think US copper thievery is bad...\n So much is being focused on prevention of radioactive materials being lost that not much else is being done to prevent ancillary erosion of capabilities.\n \n Still, all that said, sub-launched BM's would be the most difficult to deal with and intercept and the best maintained. So, currently, I'd agree that all this posturing seems pointless.\n And we're just doing it to make it look like we're 'pro-active'.\n Plus...it redraws geopolitical lines and lets potential allies and enemies see something visible beyong empty words.\n \n IIRC, past BM defense treaties allowed some defenses. Moscow was supposedly defended by their own version of the missile defense system in the past (I doubt it worked though) but the Us gave up on defense and went the route of M.A.D. when it was viewed as being cheaper and possibly more effecticve at preventing a nuclear war.\n \n I doubt any exchange would lead to a holocaust (change geopolitics, hell yes) and I don't think it'd lead to a general world war. But, I do think it'd lead to a general period of anarchy as many sought to settle debts, succeed from a parent nation or engage in a local war of conquest because 'big brother' nations aren't there to cause problems for them if they do. Think Serbia, Rwanda, Georgia, Iraq-Kwait...on a global level. And Pakistan-India could go nuclear too...unless they get 'scared straight' by what happened to the US/Russia...which I doubt.\n \n \n Still, I wouldn't worry about sabre rattling by unnamed Russian generals over nuclear issues. \n I'd be more interested in studying how Russia responded to the Georgian issue so quickly and effectively and trying to find out how well off it's conventional military is and how willing Russia is to flex such muscle if it keeps hearing 'America is over extended, tired of fighting, and not winning vs petty 3rd world nations in the middle east.' \n I personally haven't heard much about Chechna recently. *shrug*\n \n My .03",

Look at the upgrades the airforce and navy get to their planes. The F-15A is night and day compared to the F-15E. The US has a long history of spending the money to make it work and getting excellent technology in the end. The F-22 has been in development for decades if you count the subsystems. Just because NMD is a joke now doesn't mean it won't work later. And that's what Russia is crapping in its pants over.",
