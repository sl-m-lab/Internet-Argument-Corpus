Have you forgotten the weeks and months after 9/11/01 so quickly that you have forgotten the National sense of panic as people stopped spending money due to the insecurity in the future economy and National Security of our Country? \n \n Car, Home and even ipod and video game sales plummeted. So it wasn't just big ticket items, but items considered to be luxuries. Why do you think the Airline and Vacation Industries suffered? It was a larger issue than a fear of flying, it became about hoarding disposable income.\n \n This led to massive lay offs in Manufacturing and at all levels of big business. And none of that was due to a direct attack on our financial infrastructure but just a glancing blow to it. It was fear and insecurity that caused the system to grind to a halt, nothing more than that. \n \n Now imagine if rather than lower taxes to increase disposable income and increase consumer spending, Bush had given us some fear based speech and raised taxes in order to prop up Government institutions in that terrible time, AS A DEMOCRAT SURELY WOULD HAVE DONE. The American people would have held on tighter to the lesser amount of money they took in and our economy would have crumbled to the point of a true collapse. The economic comeback this Country experienced is completely due to this President, yet how short your memory is when it's convenient for you.\n \n Let our enemies get 1 kiloton suitcase nukes into 5 of our Ports and 1 each in New York and DC and this Nation will cease to exist as an economic Superpower in 1 hours time. We will revert to the status of a third world country IMMEDIATELY, AND REMAIN THERE FOR 50 YEARS. I challenge you to refute one thing I have said as anything but the absolute reality of what has transpired and what will transpire if our enemies are able to carry out the scenario I mention above.\n \n So it's easy to sit here and lay every problem on Bush. But without looking at what might have been had we made different decisions at crucial moments, you're just blowing so much unsubstantiated smoke which is based on nothing more that wishful thinking on your part and betting on the unknown.

   "If this current joke of a President were really serious about prosecuting the current phony war, he would have taken these steps as a beginning:\n \n 1. Reinstitute the draft - his power as CiC would have given him the authority to do so.\n 2. Institute rationing of vital commodities as was done in WWII by FDR. Strict limits on meat, sugar, tires, and gasoline for starters.\n 3. Institute an excess profits tax on corporations and individuals, again as was done in WWII.\n 4. Immediately increase income taxes so that the cost of the present war would not be shouldered by generations yet to come.\n 5. Institute a War Resources Board, such as the one headed by the Senator Harry Truman to ferret out waste, fraud, inefficiency, and excess war proifteering.\n \n Since none of these were done, we can only believe that:\n A. The current President does not believe there is a REAL war\n OR \n B. He sees the war as a chance for his cronies to get rich on the peoples' dimes.",

That's why my very first words on this reply was, CAN YOU PROVE THAT? Because we both know you can't.\n\n \n You fail to see that Bush is just a pawn in a wider and more sinister and deadly chess game. He may be a queen in your game but I feel he's on the wrong board. Besides not all persons can blame Bush because if you forget he is jsut one branch of government and is limited by the checks and balances.\n \n However I will say that as a whole him and his neo con buddies spinned a lot of bull to make congress dance to their agenda's and ploys. If you looks at what exactly has happened here, these last 8 years were due to failure as far back as Bush senior. For Gulf War one we could have had Saddam, we could have done all we needed to then, but failed to do so, and as a result look where were at now.\n \n Also during the Clinton adminsitration, our military was cut down, and our intelligence turned a blind eye to Al Queda and the terrorists cells brewing. As a result, 9/11. Now we cannot pin the blame for 9/11 on any single person but rather it is all the institutions and bodies to prevent these attacks that clearly failed. \n \n As a result you have an inexperienced president who has to deal with the worst attack on American soil since Pearl Harbour. And he actually handled it quite well for the time being. But then what do we see? A ploy. A spin and whalla you have before you a nicely wraped package of bull spun by the puppet masters of this country to pacify the American people due to fear and they exploited that fear to the highest degree to succeed in their agendas. \n \n Only now after the damage has been done and the executives of these banks who had one hell of a party on the average americans dollar, and the politicians who are bailing out after eight years, only now do we see the pure form of our govenrment and its \"highest\" financial institutions. Their all corrupt.\n \n And as a result, we the middle man, the average citizen suffer at the hands of these power mongers who played with fire and made off like bandits. It's not just Bush but this entire government and it's financial institutions that are indeed pitted and decayed with the putrid reek of corruption. And now we find ourselves with over 4000 brave talented heroes who died for a false cause and a false ideal that was spun on the fly by those who could not prove a reasonable reason to why these people died.\n \n And we find that out economy is indeed in shambles and is faltering. Not just ours but the world economy is crumbling. Thanks Wall st. Thank Mr AIG execs with your 500 thousand dollar party in So Cal jsut before you declare a bailout. Thanks Mr. Bush and Cheny for being the pawns you were. And thanks to the government for failtering on so many levels and showing just how weak you really are.\n \n And thanks to the American people (myself included) who failed to see this coming and did nothing. We need to stop this trainwreck. Put on the brakes and look at each and every elected official's voting record and their attendance and what exactly they have supported and out the bastards who are taking away out country from us. We all need to wake up before its too late.",
