Have you also noticed that as they get older their beliefs change as they begin to learn the truth?\n \n Well, Christ told us that we have to become like little children IF we want to enter the kingdom of heaven (See Matthew 18:1-4 below). What Christ was trying to teach us is that we have to BELIEVE and TRUST GOD like little children BELIEVE and TRUST their parents. After all GOD is OUR FATHER and unlike our parents HE really does KNOW EVERYTHING and HE can make ANYTHING HAPPEN. So that BELIEF SHOULDN'T change as we get older and wiser. GOD has the knowledge and power that innocent children BELIEVE their parents have.\n \n Christ even told us how MUCH MORE OUR FATHER knows than him. In Matthew 24:36 (see below), Christ admitted that he DOESN'T know when the end will come ONLY OUR FATHER knows that. As INNOCENT CHILDREN we can let OUR FATHER take care of things for us. Unlike our earthly parents GOD OUR FATHER can take care of us and control everything for us. We need to LOVE and TRUST HIM just like innocent little children love and trust their parents to take care of them. That's how GOD wants us to live our lives.

No one comes to the Father except through me.\n \n Romans 3:23\n For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\n \n John 3:5\n Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.\n \n Isaiah 14:21\n Prepare a place to slaughter his sons for the sins of their forefathers; they are not to rise to inherit the lands and cover the earth with their cities. \n \n Exodus 20:5\n \"You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me,\" \n \n also Deut. 5:9 \n \n 1 Corinthians 15:2\n \"For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.\" \n \n I can go on Arch.\n \n No one gets into heaven except through the son who will speak on their behalf. For ONLY the son judges.\n You MUST accept the sacrifice and gift of eternal life of the son in order to get into heaven.\n NO ONE is worthy of their own accord to enter into the kingdom of heaven for all have sinned. All have inherited sin and God destest sin so much that he must forever be seperated from it.\n All will die in their sin unless it is washed away in the shed blood of Christ.\n \n NOWHERE does it make an exception to these simple rules.\n You can speculate and 'make stuff up' and say a child will go to heave automatically but the bible simply doesn't support this. It'd be far easier and more biblically logical to say that until a human reaches a certain age, they simply possess no 'soul/spirit' and their lives and deaths are meaningless. But, then this logic would support abortion and infantcide...much like the bible kinda does already.\n In the bible, those who'd be mentally ill (mental illness does NOT exist in the bible) are actually demonically possessed. Through their own actions or the actions of their forefathers, they have allowed themselves to be taken over. Heaven is not for them.\n In the bible, nearly all illness and afflictions are the result of sin. Being unable to accept the salvation of Jesus due to disability of mind or body is NO excuse. You go to hell. In the bible, you are shunned for this easily understood fact.\n A simplton is cursed by God and tormented by Satan. The kingdom id denied to them.\n If a simpleton can't get to heaven, what makes you think a child could?\n Simply because you can't fathom that (as you recently said yourself) 'that's the rules of the Mighty God!' Who are you to question such?\n \n Now Arch, I know you don't believe in some of these concepts despite them being in your bible but, tough. It's not MY fault nor anyone elses, not even Gods that you have embraced the lies of the Satanically influenced. Just as nearly all have. \n You use man-made logic on thinking a child to be innocent when the bible says None are.\n You've listened to the pimpery of selfrightious pastors that have been unrestrained for generations who, over the centuries have slowly perverted holy scripture. And you KNOW that all they are doing is tickling the ears of their followers for their own glorification and worldly promotion. It takes a devoted lover of God a lot of faith to accept the fact that their child will burn in hell as God wishes and STILL believe and love Him. But, you know many people can't o that. And when people don't listen to the TRUTH, they certainly won't spend their time of money on it.\n Without these generations of ear tickling, do you really think the church would have grown as it had? Anyone can join a fadsy fun-filled feel-good jamboree but, that's not what God wants. Bible says so. Only a FEW will make it to heaven. Those who can run the good race and maintain their faith in God even when it's hard to do and accepting that not only with children burn but the majority of the human race for all time. \n \n You've compromised your faith. And it IS your fault. While you could scapegoat your pastors and church leaders and the false doctrine you've allowed yourself to listen too, but you are ultimatly responsible for listening to the Word of God no matter how harsh it may be. \n \n \n Unless of course, it is God who has punished you (possibly through the sins of your forefathers) to believe this way so as to ensure your damnation too...God kinda works in those ways...bible says so...\n \n And remember, IN ALL THINGS GODS WILL WILL BE DONE. \n Bible says so.",

   "I'm sorry Zardoz, you're right about all of these verses. And I know each of them intimately and live by their truth. But what you're missing and I am too tired to argue with you over is that God is a gracious and merciful God who would never send babies to hell since they are unable to receive Him both emotionally and intellectually. \n \n I mentioned the Jewish Bar-Mitzvah Laws that go back to Deuteronomy and Leviticus. They are valid traditions and based in Gods Laws of mercy for children who are too young to be held responsible for their actions. This is only reasonable from a loving and compassionate God. But I can't expect one who sees only through legalistic eyes to appreciate these nuances to Gods love and understanding of the human condition. Here is more on the Tradition. \n \n http://www.barmitzvahs.org/judaism/barmitz.php\n Bar Mitzvah, Bat Mitzvah and Confirmation\n \n \"Bar Mitzvah\" literally means \"son of the commandment.\" \"Bar\" is \"son\" in Aramaic, which used to be the vernacular of the Jewish people. \"Mitzvah\" is \"commandment\" in both Hebrew and Aramaic. \"Bat\" is daughter in Hebrew and Aramaic. (The Ashkenazic pronunciation is \"bas\")\n \n Under Jewish Law, children are not obligated to observe the commandments, although they are encouraged to do so as much as possible to learn the obligations they will have as adults. At the age of 13 (12 for girls), children become obligated to observe the commandments. The Bar Mitzvah ceremony formally marks the assumption of that obligation, along with the corresponding right to take part in leading religious services, to count in a minyan (the minimum number of people needed to perform certain parts of religious services), to form binding contracts, to testify before religious courts and to marry.\n \n In its earliest and most basic form, a Bar Mitzvah is the celebrant's first aliyah. During Shabbat services on a Saturday shortly after the child's 13th birthday, the celebrant is called up to the Torah to recite a blessing over the weekly reading.\n \n Today, it is common practice for the Bar Mitzvah celebrant to do much more than just say the blessing. It is most common for the celebrant to learn the entire haftarah portion, including its traditional chant, and recite that. In some congregations, the celebrant reads the entire weekly torah portion, or leads part of the service, or leads the congregation in certain important prayers. The celebrant is also generally requied to make a speech, which traditionally begins with the phrase \"today I am a man.\" The father recites a blessing thanking G-d for removing the burden of being responsible for the son's sins.\n \n \n The age set for bar mitzvah is not an outdated notion based on the needs of an agricultural society, as some suggest. This criticism comes from a misunderstanding of the significance of the bar mitzvah. Bar mitzvah is not about being a full adult in every sense of the word, ready to marry, go out on your own, earn a living and raise children. The Talmud makes this abundantly clear. In Pirkei Avot, it is said that while 13 is the proper age for fulfillment of the Commandments, 18 is the proper age for marriage and 20 is the proper age for earning a livelihood. Elsewhere in the Talmud, the proper age for marriage is said to be 16-24. Bar mitzvah is simply the age when a person is held responsible for his actions and minimally qualified to marry.\n \n If you compare this to secular law, you will find that it is not so very far from our modern notions of a child's maturity. In Anglo-American common law, a child of the age of 14 is old enough to assume many of the responsibilities of an adult, including minimal criminal liability. In many states, a fourteen year old can marry with parental consent. Children of any age are permitted to testify in court, and children over the age of 14 are permitted to have significant input into custody decisions in cases of divorce.\n ",

   "But Archy...\n \n I'm not a Jew. \n Neither are you.\n \n And the more important thing...\n Those are man-made laws and like the Bris (circumcision), really don't mean much in the eyes of the Lord. Heck, even that practice was lamented and cast aside as being needed to please God by Pauls clear revelation and subsequent chastisement of Peter who wanted the practice to continue.\n \n All a Bat/Bar mitzvah dealt with was whether you were an Adult and capable of looking after yourself on your own and to be held LEGALLY responsible in regards to the laws.\n \n At 13, you were an adult. Capable of being married and being treated as an adult.\n They did it younger then than they do now (18 and 21).\n And legally held responsible for actions is NOT the same as beliefs nor in following Gods laws. Failure to honor thy mother and father could see you stoned as a child according to the bible. \n \n A careful review of the OT laws will find many of them man-made and many God dictated. Most who don't understand the culture and history would be confused. Take the Exodus decres of God who'd visit the generation style punishment upon the descendants of those guilty of crimes against Him and then compare them to decrees of the Jewish laws that held you accountable for your own crimes (no pass-ons to your children).\n \n When you claim 'legalistic'...it's not the truth. When you claim mans laws and cultural traditions as evidence...now, that's legalistic. When you cite the Word of God, of Jesus and of His inspired and guided Prophets...it's not legalistic. It's the LAW.\n \n In true regards to God's will and infants, you should simply leave it up to God.\n If it is HIS will that they return to Him, it will be done in accordance to his private wishes that he need not share with man.\n If it's HIS will that they be cast aside, it will be done also.\n Anything a man has to say about it would, unless supported by His decree, be simply made up, feel-good make believe.\n \n As for youth, many children in todays cultures are taught to be believers at an early age. Take the documentary Jesus Camp. One of the children there said he became a believer at age 4. \"I just wanted more out of life.\" is the parroted words he used.\n Take the words of Jesus in the bible themselves. 'Do not suffer the little children who want to come' to Him. This makes it clear that Children can KNOW to come to Him and thus can be responsible for their own actions and others should NOT oppose them (millstone about the neck would be better than what they'll suffer for doing so as the bible says).\n So, a simpler interpretation of the very passages GodsCowboy is looking at is NOT that children get an automatic pass to Heaven but, rather HAVE the ability to accept Jesus (at any age) so that they can go to heaven.\n \n \n Now, while I personally would like to think that IF there is a heaven and hell, children would get an automatic pass if something happens to them in life and get paradise rather that torment, we have no guarantee that this is what would happen.\n \n \n If you want to live a legalistic Jewish life and accept the OT covenant for His people, go ahead and do that and hope that Jewish laws and following all of the other associated rules to a 'T' will suffice for entry to heaven.\n I know many fundy's and evangelistic Christians say the unsaved Jews are damned for their refusal to accept the Messiah.\n Some however, say they are the Chosen of God and will get a pass because of that.\n But, being Chosen merely meant that they were the ones whom God sent his Messiah for. Jesus after all DID appear to them. The gentiles had to trust in the words of Paul and hope that Gods promises to Him people would apply to the filthy hoards of formerly paganistic peoples...the kind Cain went to. The kinds often decreed to be exterminated by the Jews as a mandate from God. The kind who were wiped out in the flood.\n \n \n And God does let children suffer. Often.\n They'll be suffering when the end times tribulations happen to. Bible says so. Daniel stated and Jesus echoed that those times will be hard for pregnant mothers AND mothers who are nursing.\n \n I know it's not hip in pop-culture Christianity for such horrors to be repeated but people should get this 'truth' from the bible and not some pimp pushing a poorly writen book filled with fiction.\n \n \n In the end, a lot of this has me reminded of the concept and practice of infant baptismal (common with Catholics and others) that parents who love God and their own children (remember Job's sacrifices for his children) so that if something happens, the child can get into heaven.\n Also, pergatory and limbo concepts were (invented) to deal with this very topic we're discussing. Becasue people just can't accept that God may cast children into the lake of fire, they sought comfort in other concepts and beliefs. Limbo is better than torment after all.\n It is interesting to see you get upset at others who can't accept that God does 'mean' things in different threads currently but, roles are reversed here.\n \n Yes, God is merciful...He sent His ONLY son to take care of the division caused by sin...and THAT IS IT.\n \n edit:\n Matthew 14:3\n Jesus replied, \"And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?\n Bar Mitzvah is a tradition. Accepting Jesus is a command of God.\n \n Matthew 19:8\n Jesus replied, \"Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.\n This applies to many of Moses' \"laws\".\n For example, eating. In the beginning, Adam and Eve at anything that grew in the garden (no one at animals then) except the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of right and wrong. Dietary laws were later added by the Jews and rescinded by Jesus and Paul. And these laws came from Moses, not God. Thus the Christ saying 'Moses permitted' and NOT 'God permitted.'\n Many of the levitical laws were made up so that the stubborn Jews were kept in check. And they were a difficult lot. Recall when they begged for a king even against the advice of God? Look what that got them. Tyrants.",

   "I would agree that infants, and some children, have not sinned and do not deserve to go to hell. Unfortunately, you are using reason to argue this. But as you have stated before, why does your god have to justify his actions to us. The bible clearly states what happens to those who do not know Jesus. You simply cannot get away from it. You're correct that it would be a horredous injustice, but that is just the way it is, and no amount of pleading and whining from you is going to change that. The bible defines your god (unless you think the bible is false, of course), your interpretation does not.\n\n And I think this pretty much sums it all up.\n Arch is selective in his beliefs and following of the dictates of his God as the bible (Gods Word in print) states. Using logic and reason and human concepts of compassion to think that a just God wouldn't do this to a child. But, in other incidents taking on the opposite stance and blindly adhearing to his holy book rather than reason. Such as with homosexuality or violence.\n \n Arch, have you ever stopped to think, for one moment, that alternatives to your 'children are innocent of sin' beliefs?\n I even speculated that children might not even have their souls/spirits yet.\n Or that initially, when the bible was composed, children HAD the ability as the bible says, to come to Jesus but, over the past 2,000 years lost that do to the corrosive influence of sin upon the earth. It's degeneration of mankind and subsequent dulling of an infants intellect.\n Such speculation I just mention would be more supported by the bible with the application of some passages dealing with these very issues.\n Supported more than your bible-contadicting belief that children are innocent of sin.\n NO WHERE is it stated or even hinted that such is true and as I pointed out by use of the holy Word, the opposit is true.\n Infants have sin and a sin nature that stains them.\n God clearly can NOT abide by this.\n His SON will be the JUDGE, not 'God', and unless the son approves, the child and any like them will go to the lake of fire where they will know a 2nd death.\n \n You even trip yourself up by making the claim that those who haven't even heard of God and Jesus and the good news are damned. Simply because IGNORANCE is not an excuse.\n That contradicts most main steam faiths you know. \n Next thing you know, a mentally retarded adult can't go to heaven because they too can't \"reason\" and accept the salvation offered by the Christ.\n \n Arch, what I'd like you to do is to re-evaluate your beliefs and reread these debates several times.\n At no point do I interject my beliefs as a truth or use my experiences to justify myself and my stance.\n I rely purely upon the bible and a clear exegisis of it. \n And, doing so, I sound mean and portray your God as humanly uncompassionate. Thankfully, your God isn't human. So human standards are not the measuring stick to judge Him by. No? heck, you're not even supposed to judge your God, which is what you're doing when you find you can't accept the holy Word as fact and see your God as unfair in tossing 'innocent' children into the fire so you make something up to justify your radical and Satanically inspired beliefs. For it must be Satan who corrupts the thoughts and practices of another in order to lead them astray and to reject the unchanging truth found in the bible.\n \n If God through Jesus tosses the child into the fire, it's correct and just in the eyes of the Lord. How you feel about it is irrelvant.\n Furthermore, there is NO real applicable difference between this and God commanding (through the prophets and others) the Jews to slaughter men, women and 'innocent' children in the bible. He wiped all out in his Flood. He promisses suffering to those here in the end times through tribulations. \n You apply earthly and temporal standards to a timeless God. A God where time means nothing. An hour, a day or a year of earthly 'suffering' is really no different that this alleged 'eternity' of suffering. For in the afterlife, time is irrelevant.\n \n As I said, concepts of child-like innocence and freedom of sin is a contemporary belief. Now you say they get a free ticket to heaven (as does the Catholic church as of recently). Before this, they had to wait in pergatory or limbo because followers wanted to beleive that their children wouldn't be tossed into hell. The priests had to find a way to tickle ears so the MADE STUFF UP.\n Doing other wise would see the followers leave the religion for other faiths...taking their funds and support with them.\n \n I'm sorry you must seek comfort in a lie perpetuated by Satan (father of all lies) rather than take comfort that no matter what, it's all in accordance to Gods plan.\n And if the truth that is presented here on these forums as found in your bible and the holy inspired Word of God rocks your world...well, that's not me. you can thank God.\n \n As for what I believe.\n That really is irrelvant to this biblically based discussion.\n It's just another form of attacking the messanger rather than dealing with the message brought.\n And if God can use a donkey (and some heretics apply this to women pastoring) to spread a message, He most certainly can use me...No?\n \n Oh, and to address your single verse.\n Mat 18:3 and Jesus said, \"Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.\n \n Here:\n I say to you, unless you convert and become like the(se) children (who have converted also*) you won't go to heaven.\n \n *Jesus was being approached by children who were SEEKING HIM OUT. He informed the adults there to leave them be and allow them to come to Him (ON THEIR OWN). Jesus then said that th adults had best be like the children present and come too.\n \n Yeah, children coming to Jesus for salvation. Your passage supports the notion that it's possible.\n \n \n In the end, I really don't even understand why people concern themselves with this.\n When you die after all and go to heaven, you won't even be concerned with anything else. No sorrow will be found there. So, if your child dies and were to go to hell for what ever reason, you only have this extremely short life to deal with it. Go to heaven and you'll know only joy. Go to hell and you'll only know your own suffering.\n I mean, geesh Arch, how many of your family members will be burning in the end? You're a convert. Not all of them can believe as you do.",

It makes no sense yet you defend such reasoning just to oppose me.\n\n \n Aah, so you feel that anyone who disagrees with you must be irrational and unreasonable. I'm sorry if I interpret this passage in a different way to you, but you seem to be ignoring the whole range of quotes made earlier that show that no-one enters the kingdom of heaven except through Jesus. There is no flexibility in that. And reasonability and rationality are irrelevant. If there were reason and logic, then good people of all faiths would be able to enter the kingdom of heaven. But as you say, there are no good people of other denominations, so reason and logic just don't take any part in these decisions.\n \n \nAnd explain you reasoning in opposing this common sense reasoning that so clearly shows why a Just God could never send children to hell who are below the age of reason as He would be denying them heaven for sins they never even committed. A holy and perfect Judge as God is could never do such a thing.\n\n This bit just shows that you haven't understood my position at all (perhaps because you didn't read my post carefully enough). I completely agree that small children who unfortunately die before being able to understand good and bad should not be judged harshly. I stated that in my last post. So a just god would not judge them harshly. However, I do not believe that your god is a just god. You have made this accusation before, but still fail to see my argument.\n \n \n[Archangel]You must admit that by your way of thinking, there is a complete class of human being, the most innocent among us no less, who have no remedy for avoiding hell. Because according to your beliefs if an infant dies he must go to hell based not on his personal sins, but only on the sinful nature of Adam and Eve which he inherited at birth.\n \n Is that the judgment of a righteous, Holy and Just God, to take the most innocent among us who die before even understanding the nature of sin and being condemned to hell for eternity for sins they never even committed?\n\n \n Not sure why you requoted this bit, I answered it in my last post.\n \n I do not admit that, by my way of thinking, that there is a complete class of human being, the most innocent among us no less, who have no remedy for avoiding hell, because I do not believe that there is a hell. According to my beliefs, if an infant dies it dies. I do not believe that the infant goes to hell, because I do not believe in hell. I do not believe it inherits the sin of Adam and Eve, because I do not believe in Adam and Eve. And to restate my position in the vain hope that you will understand it this time, I do not believe that your scenario would be the judgement of a righteous, holy and just god (it would indeed be abhorrent), but then I do not believe that your god is a righteous, holy and just god.\n \n \nSo please believe as you like. It is your life, your sense of reason you must live with, and your own truth you must reconcile within your own heart and mind. I personally don't care what you believe. My only responsibility is to share the truth as I understand it. What you do with that is completely on you.\n\n I am truly grateful to you for allowing me to believe as I wish. It is my life, and my sense of reason, and I am perfectly prepared to live with it. At least this time you have accepted that it is my own 'truth'.\n \n Smiley",

This doesn't imply at all that because Timothy was raised in the ways of the Lord since childhood that either he or any other children would be condemned to hell had they died in childhood. The whole book doesn't deal with that aspect of life or that question at all. So to somehow deduce that from this book at all is to completely corrupt and misrepresent the message of 2 Timothy.\n \n You can twist and squirm in the wind all you like as you attempt to justify once again claiming complete and total victory in your false assertions by once again pulling a passage completely out of context but that won't make you any more right now than you were yesterday. \n \n Just explain to me why if children will be judged like adults and condemned to hell if they die in childhood does JESUS tell adults they wont enter the kingdom of heaven unless they become like children?",

You KNOW this to be factual. God criticism in the end of Job makes it clear. \n Jesus says that adults need to be like the children who are COMING TO HIM, not INNOCENT but Humbled.",

   "I've made my point and crushed your misrepresentation of the bible once again Zardoz, so I see no reason at all to continue this debate as you twist in the wind trying to rationalize your lies and abuses of the bible. These posts recap the complete issue and expose your error for all to read in one post.\n \n \nAll we can do is read the bible and understand the simple truths contained therein.\n \n And, rather than repeat this thread over, simply read it and quit asking stupid questions.\n A believer need not ask but simply comply with the will of God.\n \n It is not a church (which is nothing more than the people who follow Christ) that says this, it's the very bible itself.\n \n See, the bible says that Jesus was the ONLY one without sin. Thus, He'd make a perfect sacrifice. \n The bible also says all others have sinned.\n There is NO middle ground.\n \n To believe otherwise is blasphemy against God.\n 2 Tim 3:14-17\n But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.\n \n From INFANCY!\n You say, 'How can an infant know scripture'? (and by knowing that, know of sin)\n Because the BIBLE SAYS SO!\n \n SCORE\n\n \n \nAgain you pat yourself on your own back for corrupting Gods Word. Again you rip a passage out of context and apply it to whatever off topic message you want to make. This verse is speaking to believers who were raised up with the bible as new believers/children in Christ in the ways of the Lord. Nowhere does this passage say or even imply that ALL children will be judged by God and condemned to hell if they die before the age of accountability, or in childhood. You know why that is? Because this passage isn't even speaking to that issue at all.\n \n Here is your passage.\n \n 2Ti 3:14 \n But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them,\n 2Ti 3:15 \n and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.\n 2Ti 3:16 \n All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,\n 2Ti 3:17 \n that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.\n SCORE\n\n \n \nWho's they Zardoz? Is it speaking to all of humanity? Read 2 Tim 1:1-2, who is Paul addressing, because that is the intended recipient whom he is speaking to throughout the letter. \n 2Ti 1:1 \n PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ[fn1] by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,\n \n 2Ti 1:2 \n To Timothy, a beloved son:\n Notice chapter 2:1, who is Paul still speaking to? \n 2Ti 2:1 \n YOU therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.\n 2Ti 2:2 \n And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.\n 2Ti 2:3 \n You therefore must endure[fn1] hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.\n Now to your verse where he is obviously speaking still to Timothy whom he has known since Timothy's childhood.\n \n 2Ti 3:10 \n But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance,\n 2Ti 3:11 \n persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra--what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me.\n 2Ti 3:12 \n Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.\n 2Ti 3:13 \n But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.\n 2Ti 3:14 \n But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them,\n 2Ti 3:15 \n and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.\n And on to chapter 4 where he continues to speak directly to Timothy about this generation of believers and what is happening right now as men create their own interpretations of the bible.\n \n 2Ti 4:1 \n I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at[fn1] His appearing and His kingdom:\n 2Ti 4:2 \n Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.\n 2Ti 4:3 \n For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers;\n 2Ti 4:4 \n and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.\n \n So dream on as to your interpretation that your passage is in any way speaking about all of humanity having been raised up in the holy scriptures since childhood so all of humanity will be condemned if they die as children as they will be held accountable for their sins by God. STOP SPEWING RUBBISH AND RIPPING SCRIPTURES OUT OF CONTEXT IN ORDER TO CREATE YOUR OWN FALSE DOCTRINES ZARDOZ. REPENT AND SEEK GODS FORGIVENESS FOR LYING AND CORRUPTING HIS WORD AT EVERY TURN. \n\n \n \nNO!!! He was saying that Timothy was raised since childhood in the ways of the Lord from the bible. This doesn't imply at all that because Timothy was raised in the ways of the Lord since childhood that either he or any other children would be condemned to hell had they died in childhood.
