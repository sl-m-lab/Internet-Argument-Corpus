   "Should the 10 Commandments be Posted in school classrooms ?\n \n http://www.youdebate.com/DEBATES/10COMMANDMENTS_IN_SCHOOL.HTM\n\n \n \n Absolutely yes! The 10 commandments are not just abot morals, although they include that. They are historical. Most of the laws of our country come from some reliance upon the 10 commandments. Event he Magna Charta relied heavily on the concepts. The 10 commandments do not need to be posted as rules to follow, but why not them in addition to the sayings of Einstein, Nietsche, Frued, or any others. Much of what our society is based on came from this as a source. They provide historical relevance. It does not support a religion, necessarily, any more than the sayings of confucious, which by the way are taught in our schools. At least they were taught to me.\n \n They would be key in teaching about the jewish culture. And we are all about multiculturalism aren't we. One could hardly teach jewish culture without teaching about the 10 commandments. Likewise one could hardly teach about christian culture without teaching anything about jesus or teaching muslim culture without teaching about Mohammed.\n \n How ridiculous that our government should make a law abridging the freedom of religion. Whether congress writes the law or the courts interpret it into existence it is still making a law.",

   "I agree with you in part and not in part.\n \n First, the ten commandments certainly are as historical as the declaration of independence. One would be hard pressed to say that they have not contributed more to culture over the MILLENNIA than the DOI has contributed over the last 200 years. \n \n Charlamagne, William the conqueror, the crusades, The estbalishment of the Holy Roman church, it's split with the orthodox church, the wars fought by the sides representing each, the decline of the roman empire, nero's burning of rome, the establishment of various legal documents inculding magna charta, and it's impact on the development of the declaration of independence. Thomas Jefferson may have rewrote the bible, but he stated that all men were created equal, that they were endowed by their creator.\n \n The 10 commandments have had huge historical significance. It was the first commandment that lead to the crusades. Just because they are availbale for children to read along with other historical documents does not mean the government fosters the establishment of religion.\n \n The government also gives money to arts community, does that mean the government is establishing an official art? No. \n \n To teach children history and not include basic building blocks is a denial of history and teaches a lie. \n \n Our schools most definitely have an obligation to teach morality. Children spend between 6 and 8 hours a day in a school. Literally 1/3 of their day. That gives the schools equal time with parents.\n \n If morality is not taught in schools then why do they have discipline? Why are students told it is not right to lie? \n \n The problem with many schools today (and here I make an unfounded assertion) is that morality has been divested from schools. Hence children are taught that they can do whatever and there will be no consequences. Our society is only just starting to take it back and we are fighting law suits where children are passed on to the next level simply because a lawyer threatens the teacher even though the teacher gave the child a failing grade. Regardless, the morality issue is irrelevant compared to the historical issue. That one is undeniable.\n \n Your sarcasm that the first four commandments actually do add up to an establishment of religion is a non argument. You make the statement that they do, prove it. The burden of proof is yours. Just because they are there, how is it that they do not have historical significance? and they only have religious significance?

A poster of the 10 commandments wasn't necessary to illustrate it.\n Tell me what purpose do you beleive a 10 commandments poster in a classroom would serve?\n\n \n 1) I never said anything about a poster, but since you bring it up, it would point out the historical significance of the beginning of human laws.\n \n 2) The crusades most certainly supported a religion. The idea was that christianity had to be forced on \"the heathen.\" This is as supporting of Christian doctrine as the first commandment. \n \n 3) If you don't believe in an absolute right or wrong and or in absolute morality then where do laws come from. They are based on something. Take a look bacwards in your thinking to decide why you think what you think.\n \n 4) Again, I have stated and you seem to ignore that The ten commandments deserves equal time. A school in california recently taught all aspects of muslim worship to its students. It was fairly well publicised at the time of the 9-11 attacks. There was a serious interest in the muslim community in america at the time.\n \n To Sundowner......To say that something written in a book has no significance is a major stretch. That would be to deny the works of Shakespeare as historical. he was not historically accurate in much of his writing but they would certainly be considered historical. \n \n Shakespeare had a significant church influence in his writings, although most would call him an agnostic, the teaching of the church is clear in Othello and Hamlett, and Romeo and Juliet to name a few.\n \n Church History is a huge part of the middle ages. it is possible some younger students have not encountered it but will. It would be difficult to talk about the dark ages, post roman empire pre Monarchies and not discuss the role of the church. The church split from Catholic and Orthodox early on provided much of the shaping of Europe.\n \n Again, The ten commandments are historical. there is no older documentation of law. They have been reproduced faithfully for millennia. No one can deny that. That in and of itself makes them have historical significance, the fact that they are a basis for all laws is also significant.",

Do you have one?\n They were the basis of the laws which came before them?\n They were the basis of laws which contradict them?\n The US only even uses a few of them (murder, theft, deceipt).\n\n \n Perhaps removal of the other is appropriate however, unlikely given the liberal stronghold that is academia.\n \n What laws came before the 10 commandments. No they are not the basis of all laws. i was incorrect in saying it that way. They are the basis of all moral law. \n \n Just because we do not use all of the laws, and we do most (No other gods, honor thy mother and father are not laws enforced), does not deny their historical significance. It should be okay to post them in the schools. \n \n Plus, to answer Poet: \n \n The phrase \"You shall have no other gods before me\" does not establish a religion without further defining the context. To say it is uniquely the christian god or the jewish god would be a stretch if one was simply teaching the historical significance about laws and their derivation.\n \n I submit that it would only be one item used to teach such a concept. Others would include the code of hamarabi, the magna charta, the constitution of the US, islamic fundamentlism (to learn of middle eastern customs and laws), etc.\n \n There is nothing inherently wrong in this. Now a student might ask what does it mean that thou shalt have no other gods before me. The explanation would be a historical one. One does not need to intimate that a student must do this but it would lead to a discussion concerning beliefs, morality and the origin of laws.\n \n This is teaching. It is not teaching to hide the truth from fear of what some might think and couch it in \"protection\".",

There was a serious interest in the muslim community in america at the time.\n \n \n I'm aware that schools teach about some religions more than others and are baised. There is a difference between having a presentation of some sort of the 10 commandments in a classroom and having them in a textbook. There is a difference between learning about the religion and teaching the religion. (If that makes sense).\n \n \nThe phrase \"You shall have no other gods before me\" does not establish a religion without further defining the context. To say it is uniquely the christian god or the jewish god would be a stretch if one was simply teaching the historical significance about laws and their derivation.\n \n \n The first four commandments deal with the establishment of the type of relationship you should have with God. Establishing the concept of God is establishing a religious viewpoint.\n \n \nI submit that it would only be one item used to teach such a concept.\n \n \n Thats why it can stay in my textbook but off my walls.\n \n Note: Please excuse all grammatical mistakes or simply bad debating.
