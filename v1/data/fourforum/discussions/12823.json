   "An interesting op-ed recently published in the Denver Post written by David Harsanyi.\n \n \nHarsanyi: Abortion debate changing\n As an atheist and a secular kinda guy, I practice moral relativism regularly. Still, I've always struggled mightily with the ethics and politics of abortion. Apparently, I'm not alone.\n \n A new Gallup poll claims that for the first time since 1995, when the question was first asked by the organization, most Americans consider themselves to be \"pro-life\" rather than \"pro-choice.\"\n \n The straightforward question asked of participants was this: \"With respect to the abortion issue, would you consider yourself to be pro-choice or pro-life?\" Fifty-one percent responded that they were pro-life and 42 percent said they were pro-choice. These percentages are the reverse found in the same poll in 2006.\n \n What happened? Is it possible that the nation has undergone a gigantic attitudinal shift on the fundamental issue of abortion in only three years' time? Logically, it seems that the entire framing of the debate has become antiquated and far too simplistic for the questions we face. Anecdotally, I would say it's possible.\n \n I know I've changed my views.\n \n After a life of being pro-choice, I began to seriously ponder the question. I oppose the death penalty because there is a slim chance that an innocent person might be executed and I don't believe the state should have the authority to take a citizen's life. So don't I owe an nascent human life at least the same deference? Just in case?\n \n You may not consider a fetus a \"human life\" in early pregnancy, though it has its own DNA and medical science continues to find ways to keep the fetus viable outside the womb earlier and earlier.\n \n But it's difficult to understand how those who harp about the importance of \"science\" in public policy can draw an arbitrary timeline in the pregnancy, defining when human life is worth saving and when it can be terminated.\n \n The more I thought about it, the creepier the issue got.\n \n Newsweek, for instance, recently reported that 90 percent of women whose fetuses test positive for Down syndrome choose an abortion. Another survey showed only a small percentage of mothers even used the test. So what happens when 90 percent of parents test their fetuses? Does it mean the end of the disease or are we stepping perilously close to eugenics?\n \n What about future DNA tests that can detect any \"defects\" in a fetus? What happens when we can use abortion to weed out the blind, mentally ill, the ugly, or any other any \"undesirable\" human being?\n \n Recently, Sweden's National Board of Health and Welfare ruled that women are permitted to abort their children based on the sex of the fetus. In the United States, a woman can have an abortion for nearly any reason she chooses. In fact, a health exemption for the mother allows abortions to be performed virtually on demand.\n \n If you oppose selective abortions, but not abortion overall, I wonder why? How is terminating the fetus because it's the wrong sex any worse than terminating the fetus for convenience's sake? The fate of the fetus does not change, only the reasoning for its extinction does.\n \n Now, I happen to believe (as the civil libertarian and pro-life activist Nat Hentoff once noted) that the right to life and liberty is the foundation of a moral society. Then again, I also believe a government ban on abortion would only criminalize the procedure and do little to mitigate the amount of abortions.\n \n Obviously, these are a few of the complex and uncomfortable issues to ponder. So maybe this poll tells us that the dynamics of the abortion debate are about to change, that Americans are getting past the politics and into the morality of the issue.\n \n Then again, it's entirely possible that I'm just projecting. \n",

   "Every animal has some type of \"mind\". Some are quite intelligent. But animals are not \"persons\" are they. Why not? Anyone care to answer? If a mind makes one person, why do animals not count?\n\n This is a fair point that has been brought up in past threads that I am willing to take on since, unlike many on both sides, I will not run away from opposition's points that do not have pre-set comfortable answers.\n \n Yes, animals also can have minds - can feel suffering, fear and apprehension. Because of this, I am a strong believer in animal rights and have given money to organizations that champion it. Mainly, I think that there should be prosecutions against un-necessary cruelty against animals and against very negligent care that leads to suffering of animals that people have taken a responsibility for. \n \n So, I do believe that animals deserve rights - particularly those that are of higher order that can actually be considered sentient. However, I do not believe that animals should have the same rights as humans. Part of this comes down to the idea that humans can form communities with fixed rules where there is a balance of rights and responsibilities that are aknowledged. Animals, though they can form social groups with some level of trends in social behavior, and even show empathy on occasion, do not have a concept of rules or responsibilities or any understanding of a concept of rights. They are incapable of even grasping the idea of rights or rules. Any rules that domesticated animals follow are simply based on learning that certain behaviors are automatically connected to punishments. Given the danger that animals can pose if left unrestrained, they simply cannot have the same rights as people.\n \n One can claim that there are people of mental disability that might have the same limitations in mental abilities as animals so why should animals have different rights than those people? That is where the second, not as morally comfortable point, comes in. Namely, if we were to give animals the same rights as even our mentally disabled people have, then we would not long survive as a species. We need to be able to control our food supplies - which often involves killing infestations of pests. We need to defend ourselves against infestations of rats and insects that can carry diseases. There are many situations where treating animals as we treat ourselves would lead to the demise of the human race. I personally don't have many moral qualms in giving preferential treatment to those of my own species to ensure its survival - as long as there are restraints on how humans treat animals that limit negative treatment to that which is necessary. \n \n On a last note on this point, a core part of my moral stance is to treat others as I would expect to be treated. This is part of a moral \"deal\" in which I treat others as I would expect to be treated but, in return, expect to also be treated fairly. I believe that most people approach morality from a similar point of view - one which has been described both in religious texts and in philosophical ones. However, there are situations in human experience where such moral consensus completely breaks down - as in the worst phases of war. In that case, far too many people break that moral consensus for one to have any trust in its continued existence. So, people who still have a conscience often default back to protecting their own, while limiting any negative behavior against others to that which is necessary. I would say that that situation has similarities to how one treats animals. With animals, there can be no moral consensus since they are incapable of making such a consensus. So, one defaults back to protecting ones own (the human species) while limiting negative behavior toward others (non-humans).\n \n -----\n \n As for the more general concept of what defines a person, this is clearly a philosophical question that is being debated. Some try to argue purely from semantics but I have always found that to be an arguement that leads nowhere since semantics only work if there is agreement on terms - which there isn't in the case of the concept of people and rights. So, mainly unsuccessfully, we here try to convince each other of our ideas of these concepts. The reality is that, so far, despite the ideas of various layment, there seems to be legal consensus that Constitutional rights begin at birth. Of course, the pro-life side is trying to push that earlier, which it has every right to try to do since, after all, we are a Democracy. However, there have been far more failures in this than successes (as demonstrated, even recently, by that failures in Colorado and South Dakota in trying to formally have embryos/fetuses be called people with rights). So, your arguments do not seem to be working in convincing most people of your view. However, I believe that you would be far more successful if you at least approached it piecemeal by arguing first for the rights of late term fetuses (where there is far more consensus on their rights) than by arguing for the rights of all pre-born (embryos and zygotes included) since there is much less consensus on early-term rights than on late-term rights. You would even find many on the pro-choice side, myself included, arguing with you for late term fetal rights.",

   "\n \n 2: the body of a human being \n\n \n You can't hang your argument on a definition meant to cover a figure of speech. Like, \"He carried it on his person\" \n That doesn't demonstrate that his body is \"a person\".\n \n \nQuestion; \"When child in the fetal stage of their life is aborted,... there is a \"body.\" A dead body. However small and under-developed,... \"Is that child's body not a \"human\" body?\nOf course it is. But it's not a human being anymore than an adult cadaver is a human being. \n \n \nSure, Trees and other plants, comatose persons, anencephalic babies, democrats, Air America listeners,....\nI must wonder why I should waste my time on someone who considers a tree a \"being\", just not human. Plants are not self-aware. Animals generally are.\n \n \nThe fact is a \"mind\" is not a requirment for the personhood of a child to be recognized when they are already alive, growing and further developing to a point after which sinjin and the rest of his Ilk will not be able to deny them their \"existence\" (personhood or rights) anymore.\nExistence isn't denied, only whether a person has come into being yet or not. \n \n \nYou mean like the word \"Fetus?\" \n \n Latin for \"Young still in the womb?\"\n \n Not sure why you would want me to expound on it, I guess.\nNo, I mean like the word \"I\" in the phrase, \"I think, therefore I am\".. Who is the \"I\" in the pre-sentient fetus?\n \n \nWhen it is used to deny the \"personhood\" of others? Of human individuals who have either lost the ability to think (persons in a coma for example) or those who are alive but not yet able to \"think?\" Yes, I most definately disagree with it.\nPeople in comas have brain waves. Pre-sentient fetuses do not. \n \n \nI don't profess to tell others what to believe. If someone is compelled by my observations and arguments (or I theirs) then this forum is serving the purpose it is partially intended for. I don't ask for more than that.\nWhen one speaks of \"facts\", one encourages others to accept them as such. \n \n \nThe Constitution is written. It has already been established that \"persons\" have a right to their life and that their life can not be justifiably denied except by due process. Therefore, if (and when) it can be established that \"personhood\" begins at conception,... our existing laws and Constitution will automatically protect the rights of the unborn.\nOn this we agree. So far, neither you nor anyone else has established that. \n \n \nThere is no need for new laws or Constitutional amendments to correct the injustice of \"elective\" abortion. \nAnd back to your presumption.",

All abortion numbers are derived from pro-abortion sources courtesy of The Alan Guttmacher Institute and Planned Parenthood's Family Planning Perspectives.\n \n Click here for the Guttmacher Institute's latest fact sheet on abortion.\n \n WORLDWIDE\n \n Number of abortions per year: Approximately 42 Million\n Number of abortions per day: Approximately 115,000\n \n Where abortions occur:\n 83% of all abortions are obtained in developing countries and 17% occur in developed countries.\n \n \u00a9 Copyright 1996-2008, The Alan Guttmacher Institute. (Guttmacher Institute: Home Page)\n \n UNITED STATES\n \n Number of abortions per year: 1.37 Million (1996)\n Number of abortions per day: Approximately 3,700\n \n Who's having abortions (age)?\n 52% of women obtaining abortions in the U.S. are younger than 25: Women aged 20-24 obtain 32% of all abortions; Teenagers obtain 20% and girls under 15 account for 1.2%.\n \n Who's having abortions (race)?\n While white women obtain 60% of all abortions, their abortion rate is well below that of minority women. Black women are more than 3 times as likely as white women to have an abortion, and Hispanic women are roughly 2 times as likely.\n \n Who's having abortions (marital status)?\n 64.4% of all abortions are performed on never-married women; Married women account for 18.4% of all abortions and divorced women obtain 9.4%.\n \n Who's having abortions (religion)?\n Women identifying themselves as Protestants obtain 37.4% of all abortions in the U.S.; Catholic women account for 31.3%, Jewish women account for 1.3%, and women with no religious affiliation obtain 23.7% of all abortions. 18% of all abortions are performed on women who identify themselves as \"Born-again/Evangelical\".\n \n Who's having abortions (income)?\n Women with family incomes less than $15,000 obtain 28.7% of all abortions; Women with family incomes between $15,000 and $29,999 obtain 19.5%; Women with family incomes between $30,000 and $59,999 obtain 38.0%; Women with family incomes over $60,000 obtain 13.8%.\n \n Why women have abortions\n 1% of all abortions occur because of rape or incest; 6% of abortions occur because of potential health problems regarding either the mother or child, and 93% of all abortions occur for social reasons (i.e. the child is unwanted or inconvenient).\n \n At what gestational ages are abortions performed:\n 52% of all abortions occur before the 9th week of pregnancy, 25% happen between the 9th & 10th week, 12% happen between the 11th and 12th week, 6% happen between the 13th & 15th week, 4% happen between the 16th & 20th week, and 1% of all abortions (16,450/yr.) happen after the 20th week of pregnancy.\n \n Likelihood of abortion:\n An estimated 43% of all women will have at least 1 abortion by the time they are 45 years old. 47% of all abortions are performed on women who have had at least one previous abortion.\n \n Abortion coverage:\n 48% of all abortion facilities provide services after the 12th week of pregnancy. 9 in 10 managed care plans routinely cover abortion or provide limited coverage. About 14% of all abortions in the United States are paid for with public funds, virtually all of which are state funds. 16 states (CA, CT, HI, ED, IL, MA , MD, MD, MN, MT, NJ, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA and WV) pay for abortions for some poor women.\n \n \n Notice some of the higher numbers of for so called \"undesirables\" also when the fetus has a disabilit\n \n Most women will request abortion after the diagnosis of a major fetal abnormality &#8212; 95% do so after the diagnosis of Down syndrome in Victoria (J Halliday, Head, Public Health Genetics, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Melbourne, personal communication). When a major fetal abnormality is diagnosed, clinical experience shows that even women who consider themselves to be antichoice commonly reevaluate their in-principle opposition to abortion.\n \n Source: http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/188_02_210108/dec10804_fm.html\n \n So how exactly is that not eugenics? \n \n And to drive the point home\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A51671-2005Apr13.html\n \n http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/abortion_eugenics/\n \n Like I said laughing at the people who think this is about them and their freedoms.\n \n From a very neutral source: \n \n http://www.abortionfacts.com/learn/history_of_blacks_and_abortion.asp\n \n Subsequently, the seeds of the eugenics movement of which abortion is only one way it is manifested, are bearing a bountiful harvest today, For every 3 Black babies born, 2 are aborted. Every month more than 133, 333 babies are aborted, more than 4 1,000 are Black Americans. It is no accident that 78% of abortuaries are located in or near predominately minority neighborhoods.\n \n Yeah you were saying? LOL",

   "Ruuichi, thanks for your stats, but I wanted Dr. No to produce stats that indicated that supported his statement:\n \nPlenty of children that were planned and wanted end up having serious problems and becoming criminals.\n \n Plenty of children that weren't planned and weren't necessarily wanted end becoming perfectly normal adults who have loving parents.\n\n There has been an interesting scholarly paper on the possibility that access to abortion cuts the incidence of crime:\n \nIn recent weeks there has been a lot of media coverage of a paper John Donohue and I recently wrote connecting the legalization of abortion in the 1970s to reduced crime in the 1990s. (A preliminary version of the paper is posted here.) The purpose of the study is to better understand the reasons for the sharp decline in crime during this decade, which, prior to our research, had largely eluded explanation. While there are many other theories as to why crime declined (more prisoners, better policing, the strong economy, the decline of crack, etc.), most experts agree that none of these very convincingly explains the 30 percent to 40 percent fall in crime since 1991.\n\n Does Abortion Prevent Crime? (1) - By Steven Levitt and Steve Sailer - Slate Magazine\n \n Their paper rests on two assumptions:\n \n1) Legalized abortion leads to fewer \"unwanted\" babies being born, and \n \n 2) unwanted babies are more likely to suffer abuse and neglect and are therefore at an increased risk for criminal involvement later in life. \n \n The first assumption, that abortion reduces the number of unwanted children, is true virtually by definition. The second assumption, that unwanted children are at increased risk for criminal involvement, is supported by three decades of academic research. If one accepts these two assumptions, then a direct mechanism by which the legalization of abortion can reduce crime has been established. At that point, the question merely becomes: Is the magnitude of the impact large or small?\n\n Of course, this paper generated a great deal of controversy and extraordinary measures were taken to render it invisible to the public.",

   "Congressman Dave Obey on George W. Bush and unemployment:\n \nWith President Bush pushing forward with his economic policy that has helped create a massive unemployment crisis, a closer analysis of the employment data shows that this crisis has now spread to almost every corner of the nation. Specifically, using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it is possible to see how many jobs have been lost by city and state since Bush took office. Here are some highlights from those findings:\n \n TWENTY-FOUR CITIES LOST OVER 4% OF THEIR WORKFORCE SINCE BUSH TOOK OFFICE: According to BLS data, more than 24 major cities in America have lost more than 4% of their entire workforce since Bush took office. Among the worst hit are Boulder, CO which has lost 16.7% of its workforce; San Jose, CA which has lost 15.9% of its workforce; San Francisco, CA which has lost 10.2% of its workforce; Flint, MI which has lost 7.7% of its workforce; and Greenville, SC which has lost 6.8% of its workforce.\n \n 37 STATES AND 173 CITIES HAVE LOST JOBS SINCE BUSH TOOK OFFICE: Out of 300 city/metropolitan areas and 50 states surveyed, 173 cities and 37 states have seen their workforces reduced since Bush took office.\n \n MORE THAN 2 MILLION JOBS LOST SINCE BUSH TOOK OFFICE: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), total non-farm employment in January 2001 was 132,413,900. The latest data from January 2003 shows that total non-farm employment is now 130,089,400 - a loss of more than 2.3 million jobs in just two years.\n \n EMPLOYMENT WAS STILL RISING WHEN BUSH TOOK OFFICE: During the months of Oct, Nov, Dec of 2000, the three months prior to the Bush inauguration, nearly 300,000 jobs were added to the economy. Even in January of 2001, employers hired 63,000 more workers and in February 75,000 more people were hired. In other words, the recession started under Bush. \n\n George Bush & Unemployment",
