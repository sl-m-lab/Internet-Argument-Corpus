She doesn't succeed. Therefore, she's useless?\n \n What if she DOES make SOME progress?\n \n What if she does make some progress, but she realistically could have easily worked 50 hours week made even MORE progress? Still useless? 60 hours a week? Why is she watching larry king live at night instead of researching, because she CAN, yet she chooses NOT to. What if it's a construction worker, they build things, that help their fellow man. What about a baby, who might bring joy to a loving couple, did the baby not \"help it's fellow man?\"\n \n Woefully inadequate IMO for a philosophy of life. I mean that constructively. I have had, and continue to have, bad ideas...having them is the only way to end up with \"better\" ideas ;)\n \n \n Regarding war. Our economy works fine with a consumer-driven engine, war isn't necessary in that respect. I'm not sure what you base this on. Besides, it's contrary to your philosophy on life:\n \n War and a prospering economy aren't a measure of worth, using your criteria, only a person's achievements with regards to bettering the lives of their fellow man give worth.\n Thus, neither war, nor the economy, are necessary conditions to achieve this. They aren't important to leading a worthwhile life, using your take on it.\n \n Still, I do agree with you that \"Knowledge without action is useless\". <--very true, but that doesn't mean knowledge is useless, nor does it mean that someone who contributes to knowledge only, is \"useless\", for other humans can use that knowledge, achieve, and it then becomes a brotherhood of achievement.\n \n I see later you mention war is inevitable given human nature...that's got nothing to do with the economy, and there may be truth in that. However, the smart man realizes this and prosposes finding ways to limit, restrict, avoid, or otherwise circumvent \"nature\". Nature tried to kill that guy with the bum heart...he got a transplant thanks to human ingenuity. We win the small battles, no reason we can't eventually win the bigger ones...
