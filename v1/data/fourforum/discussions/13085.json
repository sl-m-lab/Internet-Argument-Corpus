   "We have seen the explosion of mob rule in the disruption and shutting down of discussion at congressional town halls called for the purpose of defining health care reform.\n \n These mobs of thugs are organized by the health insurance and pharmaceutical industriies, with organization help from the same thugs who rioted in Florida in 2000 in order to shut down the vote count and make it possible for George W. Bush to be selected for the presidency of the United States.\n \n There has also been numerous and recurring incidents of violence directed against American women:\n \n \nWomen at Risk\n By BOB HERBERT\n \"I actually look good. I dress good, am clean-shaven, bathe, touch of cologne - yet 30 million women rejected me,\" wrote George Sodini in a blog that he kept while preparing for this week's shooting in a Pennsylvania gym in which he killed three women, wounded nine others and then killed himself.\n \n We've seen this tragic ritual so often that it has the feel of a formula. A guy is filled with a seething rage toward women and has easy access to guns. The result: mass slaughter.\n \n Back in the fall of 2006, a fiend invaded an Amish schoolhouse in rural Pennsylvania, separated the girls from the boys, and then shot 10 of the girls, killing five....\n \n We have become so accustomed to living in a society saturated with misogyny that the barbaric treatment of women and girls has come to be more or less expected.\n \n .... The mainstream culture is filled with the most gruesome forms of misogyny, and pornography is now a multi-billion-dollar industry - much of it controlled by mainstream U.S. corporations.\n \n One of the striking things about mass killings in the U.S. is how consistently we find that the killers were riddled with shame and sexual humiliation, which they inevitably blamed on women and girls. The answer to their feelings of inadequacy was to get their hands on a gun (or guns) and begin blowing people away.\n \n What was unusual about Sodini was how explicit he was in his blog about his personal shame and his hatred of women. \"Why do this?\" he asked. \"To young girls? Just read below.\" In his gruesome, months-long rant, he managed to say, among other things: \"It seems many teenage girls have sex frequently. One 16 year old does it usually three times a day with her boyfriend. So, err, after a month of that, this little [expletive] has had more sex than ME in my LIFE, and I am 48. One more reason.\"\n \n I was reminded of the Virginia Tech gunman, Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people in a rampage at the university in 2007. While Cho shot males as well as females, he was reported to have previously stalked female classmates and to have leaned under tables to take inappropriate photos of women. A former roommate said Cho once claimed to have seen \"promiscuity\" when he looked into the eyes of a woman on campus.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/opinion/08herbert.html",

   "From Rachel Maddow, MSNBC, in an interview with Frank Schaeffer, former right wing evangelical and author of Crazy for God.:\n \nRachel: Do you think that calling the President a \"nazi\"...calling the President \"Hitler\"...is an implicit call for politically motivated violence?\n \n Schaeffer: Yes I do. In fact this rings a big bell with me because my dad who is a right wing evangelical leader wrote a book called \"A Christian Manifesto\"...and in that book he compared anybody who was pro-abortion to the nazi Germans; and he said that using violence or force to overthrow nazi Germany would have been appropriate for Christians including the assassination of Hitler. He compared the Supreme Court's actions on abortion to that. And that has been a note that has been following the right wing movement that my father and I helped start...\n \n So what's being said here is really two messages: there's the message to the predominately white, middle-aged crowds of people screaming at these meetings trying to shut them down; but there's also a coded message to what I would call the \"looney tunes\" - the fruitloops on the side - that's really like playing Russian roulette. You put a cartridge in the chamber and you spin and once in a while it goes off, and we saw that with Dr. Tiller, we've seen it happen numerous times in this country with the violence against political leaders whether it's Martin Luther King or whoever it might be... we have a history of being a well-armed violent country. And so, really, I think that these calls are incredibly irresponsible....\n\n Daily Kos: Update: Thank You Rachel Maddow & Frank Schaeffer!!",

This is free speech were talking about. Some people are angry but the majority I've seen are old people who don't understand what's going on with there #1 priority. The lawmakers don't even understand (too long to read) and Obama's calling for it to be signed in a week. How can you deny a persons right to question their govt. (esp on something a important as health). Not to mention that if it was so important the Dems have had 2 years to put something together and not wait till the last week. Why didn't they start working on this years ago. Sorry, got off point. Anyway, I'd like to develop the new tactic of trying to deny citizens the right to speak to (hell, and even protest) something, just because you don't agree with their position.

Your side wouldn't be receiving these criticisms if you didn't stoop to accusing average americans of doing precisely what your side always does as a political standard practice. \n \n You will ignore the SEIU's and ACORN's organized protests with Tee Shirts and banner signs for leftist causes while accusing regular americans of being paid mobs for simply, finally showing up and calling these liars the liars that they are.

If you get an e-mail or see something on the Web about anti-war protests that seem fishy, send it to flag@whitehouse.gov.\"\n \n Substitute the words \"health insurance reform\" for \"anti-war protests,\" and you get the exact wording of a blog posted by Macon Phillips, the White House director of new media, on Tuesday. \n \n Now I'd also like to know how you can actually say that the Right is the side trying to shut down debate. Obama INTENTIONALLY tried to put a deadline on passing this bill by Aug. If he'd have gotten his way, there would have been NO TOWNHALL MEETINGS!!!! How can you not see the hypocrisy there?\n \n I'd really like to know if you'd really rather have the govt. put a muzzle on these people? I can't imagine you'd take that chance and have another Bush type president elected to office. What would you do then, change your mind? This is hypocrisy of the 1st degree and its dangerous to the 1st amendment. I'd never try to shut down people I disagree with (let alone 70 year olds asking about their healthcare), I'd fight just as hard for acorn (there's a group that spreads misinformation...with taxpayer money at that lol) to be able to speak as I would for Rush. I'd even fight for Glenn Beck!! (yuck!)",

   "\"There was no such hand-wringing over the decline of civil debate, during, say, election 2004, when cadres of organized demonstrators carrying swastika-adorned pictures of George W. Bush routinely swarmed about, and packed rallies. There was also that other \"breakdown of our media culture,\" that will dwarf all else as a cause for embarrassment, the town-hall coverage included, for the foreseeable future. That would be, of course, the undisguised worshipful reporting of the candidacy of Barack Obama.\n \n That treatment, or rather its memory-like the adulation of his great mass of voters-has had its effect on this president, and not all to the good. The election over, the warming glow of those armies of supporters gone, his capacity to tolerate criticism and dissent from his policies grows thinner apace. His lectures, explaining his health-care proposals, and why they'll be good for everybody, are clearly not going down well with his national audience.\n \n This would have to do with the fact that the real Barack Obama-product of the academic left, social reformer with a program, is now before that audience, and what they hear in this lecture about one of the central concerns in their lives-his message freighted with generalities-they are not prepared to buy. They are not prepared to believe that our first most important concern now is health-care reform or all will go under.\n \n The president has a problem. For, despite a great election victory, Mr. Obama, it becomes ever clearer, knows little about Americans. He knows the crowds-he is at home with those. He is a stranger to the country's heart and character.\n \n He seems unable to grasp what runs counter to its nature. That Americans don't take well, for instance, to bullying, especially of the moralizing kind, implicit in those speeches on health care for everybody. Neither do they wish to be taken where they don't know they want to go and being told it's good for them.\"\n \n More at Dorothy Rabinowitz: Obama&#8217;s Tone-Deaf Health Campaign - WSJ.com",

   "Wow, even some liberals like Camille Paglia are starting to see the light on all this ...\n \n \"... I must confess my dismay bordering on horror at the amateurism of the White House apparatus for domestic policy. When will heads start to roll? I was glad to see the White House counsel booted, as well as Michelle Obama's chief of staff, and hope it's a harbinger of things to come. Except for that wily fox, David Axelrod, who could charm gold threads out of moonbeams, Obama seems to be surrounded by juvenile tinhorns, bumbling mediocrities and crass bully boys.\n \n Case in point: the administration's grotesque mishandling of healthcare reform, one of the most vital issues facing the nation. Ever since Hillary Clinton's megalomaniacal annihilation of our last best chance at reform in 1993 (all of which was suppressed by the mainstream media when she was running for president), Democrats have been longing for that happy day when this issue would once again be front and center.\n \n But who would have thought that the sober, deliberative Barack Obama would have nothing to propose but vague and slippery promises -- or that he would so easily cede the leadership clout of the executive branch to a chaotic, rapacious, solipsistic Congress? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom I used to admire for her smooth aplomb under pressure, has clearly gone off the deep end with her bizarre rants about legitimate town-hall protests by American citizens. She is doing grievous damage to the party and should immediately step down.\n \n There is plenty of blame to go around. Obama's aggressive endorsement of a healthcare plan that does not even exist yet, except in five competing, fluctuating drafts, makes Washington seem like Cloud Cuckoo Land. The president is promoting the most colossal, brazen bait-and-switch operation since the Bush administration snookered the country into invading Iraq with apocalyptic visions of mushroom clouds over American cities.\n \n You can keep your doctor; you can keep your insurance, if you're happy with it, Obama keeps assuring us in soothing, lullaby tones. Oh, really? And what if my doctor is not the one appointed by the new government medical boards for ruling on my access to tests and specialists? And what if my insurance company goes belly up because of undercutting by its government-bankrolled competitor? Face it: Virtually all nationalized health systems, neither nourished nor updated by profit-driven private investment, eventually lead to rationing.\"\n \n More at Obama's healthcare horror | Salon",
