   "Material things don't bring peace and happiness. Today billions of people have got things which even Kings did not have in the past. Car, computer, television, fridge, telephone - no King ever had these things. But people are still restless and unhappy. The fast-paced, consumerist lifestyle of Industrial Society is causing exponential rise in psychological problems - besides destroying the environment. Our Minds cannot be peaceful when attention-spans are down to nanoseconds, microseconds and milliseconds.\n\n \n Who's to say what peace and happiness are when you're talking about the entire human race? When has the entire human race ever been peaceful and happy? In the past, before industrialisation?\n OK, my car makes me happy because I can travel with ease, my TV (occasionally ie when I'm watching something that isn't XXXX) makes me happy because it entertains me. My fridge makes me happy because I can keep lots of different food and make interesting meals. My telephone makes me happy because it links me to hundreds of people.\n Of course I am aware that all these technological innovations have their downsides, but everything has a downside. People who lived hundreds, or thousands, of years ago had shorter lives, were prone to horrible diseases, did not live in the relative personal security we have in developed countries, and I think if there were some way of measuring happiness we would find that they were no more happy than we are today.\n I don't think there is any evidence to support the notion that the cause of mental illness is industrial society. We do know that mental illness existed before industrial society.\n You talk about attention spans reducing...this doesn't make any sense to me. OK we do live in a fast-paced world, and the popularity of inventions like TV and computer games shows that we like surprises, we like being surprised continually, to have exciting stuff to look at and interact with which evolves quickly. This is just one facet of our intellect, and shows how amazing are brains are that they can cope with all that information.\n Another facet of our intellect, however, is the ability to spend a long period of time doing something. I have spent ages reading your posts and writing this one, I spend hours studying for my degree, I have stood in places of great beauty and just stared at them, without my mind wandering and worrying because my attention span has somehow been reduced by living in the 21st century. \n \n \nConsumerist-Lifestyle is just not sustainable. If we do not immediately return to living a very simple and frugal life then very soon there will be no human life on earth.\n\n \n Well it's obviously true that our consumption of resources is not sustainable, however there is no way 6 billion people are going to suddenly agree to live a simple and frugal life. It's just not in our nature. You talked about people being \"restless and unhappy\" in modern society, this is because no matter how many mod cons we have, we will always want more, want it better, want to see what happens if we do something new. This is why we have spread all over the earth and achieved so many things (both good and bad). This is why communism never works, because people don't want to have a static existence where their life will be the same, every day, where they won't have the promise of new and interesting experience.\n So it's just not going to happen, and we will undoubtedly enter a chaotic era of global crisis which will be a testing time for the species. I seriously doubt, however, that we will wipe ourselves out, unless we have a nuclear war. \n Our population is far too big, China and India are industrialising, and very soon demand will outstrip supply on a global scale. This will lead to breakdowns in society, to wars, famine, disease and general death and chaos, and over a long period of time a lot of people will die. But there will be survivors.\n Nature's capacity to heal itself is incredible - in the worst of the 5 mass extinction events that the planet has experienced, 95% of all life was destroyed, but the survivors carried on and eventually produced the world we live in now.\n \n \nVery soon there will be 1 Animal and 1 Tree left in this world - and people will still be thinking positive.\n\n \n Slightly hyperbolic, don't you think? Unless we have a massive nuclear war, there is NO WAY we will wipe out all life on earth. An species that becomes too populous for it's environment dies back. This will happen to us, for more complex reasons than other species because of who we are, but it will happen, and the planet will recover, and our descendents will hopefully learn from our mistakes.\n \n I understand your concerns, but I think you're being far too idealistic as regards to your notion of human happiness, and completely melodramatic in your ideas of what the future holds. This century, and the next, will be dangerous and uncertain, but we are not going to kill the planet, or ourselves.\n \n Take a break, relax, have a beer or something, and enjoy your life!",

   "Regarding Industrialization there is an important point to be noted. Modern Industrial Society has existed for 100 years - 200 years - 300 years. When we compare this period with the total duration for which human society has existed on earth this period is so short - so small that it almost does'nt exist. It is almost zero. \n \n Material things don't bring peace and happiness. Today billions of people have got things which even Kings did not have in the past.

Everyone can add 2+4 within microseconds. A PhD level problem of mathematics would take hours [or more] to solve - and that too only by someone who has spent 20 - 25 years learning mathematics upto PhD level. \n \n Same way in the field of emotions there are easy emotions and difficult emotions. Easy emotions are evoked within nanoseconds, microseconds and milliseconds - anger, lust, fear, pleasure, entertainment and excitement are some examples. These emotions are associated with fast breathing and heart-rate. These emotions don\"t require gaps between thinking to evoke, intensify and sustain. These are the emotions that can be found everywhere in today's fast society. \n \n Then there are difficult emotions - which require ability and years of effort to develop - emotions associated with pain, compassion and peaceful states of mind are some examples. These emotions are associated with slow breathing and heart-rate. These emotions require freezing of thought - freezing of visuals and words - huge amounts of gaps between thinking - to evoke, intensify and sustain. \n \n sushil_yadav",

   "There was a time when Man used to say - \n \n \n I work in order to feed my family. \n I work in order to put Food on the Table. \n \n \n \n Today man is putting a lot more than Food on the Table. \n \n Cars, Computers, ipods, Aeroplanes, Luxury Yatchs, Caribbean Vacations, Palatial Homes, Video Phones, Designer Clothes, Designer Drugs, Cosmetic Surgery ............... The list is endless. \n \n \n Man is putting thousands of consumer goods and services on the Table. \n There is too much weight on the Table. \n And the Table has begun to creak. \n \n \n \n The more you put on your table the more you take out from the mouths of Animals and Birds. \n \n The more you put on your table the more you kill Animals and Trees. \n \n The more you put on your table the more you kill Water, Air and Land. \n \n The more you put on your table the more you kill Mountains and Valleys. \n \n The more you put on your table the more you kill the Sky and Oceans - the Rivers and Lakes. \n \n \n \n \n \n There are so many things on the Table that one can barely see the Food. \n \n \n We need just a few things to live. \n And we are making thousands of things. \n \n Billions of people are engaged in making, buying and selling of thousands of consumer goods. \n \n \n \n Destroy Shopping Culture. \n Destroy Industrial Society. \n \n \n Go back to Simple Living. \n Go back to putting just Food on the Table. \n \n \n sushil_yadav\n\n \n Back then it took all the work someone could do to put food on the table. Now we have become much more productive at putting food on the table. Think about what people do for a living. One company could make enough food to put on everyone's table. What happens for everyone not working for them? No one's buying computers, cars, etc. so they can't get their money to buy food. Of course there would be such a supply of food that it may be cheap enough for anyone to afford, being that it would be the only commodity available on the market. If you want to only focus on putting food on the table for your family, you'll do way better off than most people. You could probably retire several years if not decades early, and assuming you're ok with only focusing on putting food on the table always have plenty to go around even if you were only able to get a minimum-wage job. But when everyone does it, we run into a small problem. I'm not sure what exactly would happen, but our lives would change drastically, and as mentioned, it's funny the method you've used to preach this message, a computer and an internet connection. There's a word for that, hipocritical.",

The solution is going to come from science and technology. Industrial Society has promoted science and technology as the magic cure for all problems.

It refused to believe there was any environmental crisis or problem. It said science and technology will always find a solution - if earth gets destroyed we will move on to another planet. \n \n Impossible dreams were sold to people in the name of science and technology.\n \n Moving to another planet would probably rank as the most impossible of all impossible things.\n \n One space shuttle exploded during take off - another exploded on the return journey.\n \n So far man has not been able to go beyond the moon.

It believes ecosystems can be saved while it continues to increase \"growth rate\", \"economy rate\" and GDP.\n \n City people are the problem - city people are the parasites eating away the ecosystems. \n \n Today 50% of world population - 3 billion people are living in cities. Most of the people living in cities are engaged in unnecessary work, overwork, destructive work - making things, buying things and selling things. \n \n We can still make our remaining ecosystems last longer if we limit our production to food, clothing and shelter [ and health care]. We can still make our remaining ecosystems last longer if we stop production of consumer goods or reduce it to the minimum level. \n \n But the problem here is - what are we going to do with the 3 billion people living in cities most of whom are engaged in making things, buying things and selling things. There is no surplus farm land on earth where these people can be relocated. \n \n All of these people cannot stop activity to do meditation - this requires ability and years of effort. So what do we do with the 3 billion people living in cities - how do we keep them occupied without destroying the ecosystems?\n \n \n Believing that we can save ecosystems while we continue making consumer goods is like believing we can cure cancer while we continue flooding the environment with thousands of carcinogens.\n \n It is like believing we can have peace in this world while the \"Military Industrial Complex\" continues to produce and sell billions of tonnes of weapons all over the world.\n \n Humans are the destroyers of ecosystems - they are not going to become the saviours of ecosystems.\n \n Asking humans to save environment is like asking petrol to extinguish a fire.\n \n \n Weather is becoming hotter, irregular and unpredictable across the globe. We have lost most of the forests and a large percentage of ice in Arctic region and glaciers elsewhere. Forests and ice have played a major role in regulating wind speed and direction of wind and monsoon/ rain clouds. Weather patterns were fairly constant for thousands of years. All that is changing now. In India the summer season is no longer the same as before - winters are not the same and monsoon rains are also no longer the same as before. \n \n In the coming years agriculture is going to collapse worldwide due to change and irregularity of weather.

We don't dump toxic chemicals in unprotected area's where it can get into the water table. And I have already made clear that our EPA regulates each and every industrial smoke stack which must be fitted with the appropriate buffers and collectors before the factories will even be activated for service. \n \n America's skies are smog free compared to India and China: Here are the 20 most polluted cities on Earth, notice that not one american city is on the list.

Clean Water Action Plan (CWAP) EPA's American Heritage Rivers < River Updates Index < American Heritage Rivers Updates See for yourself that we have been committed to and active in cleaning our own house for many decades now. Actually, since the early 70's when the EPA was founded for just this reason of cleaning the serious air pollution in cities like Los Angelus where the particulate levels were so high that asthmatics and people with other lung ailments couldn't even leave their homes on certain days for health reasons. \n \n So America has been seriously committed to this endeavor for going on 50 years and we have proven that if man works with mother nature which is a self cleaning environment, the earth can and will clean itself and remain pristine.

The topic of my article says - Industrial Society Destroys Mind and Environment - and since I am living in a city and am a part of \"Industrial Society\" I get included automatically. \n\n \n Which is why you didn't when Archie stated that India is worse in pollution than the U.S., yet you continue to criticize the U.S. It doesn't matter if you're automatically included, it shows that you're no activist.\n \n \nBy the way , let me tell you - the computer I am using belongs to someone else in the family. I am using very few other consumer goods and services. I invite people who are bothered about my use of computer to post a list of all the consumer goods and services they are using - I will post my list - and then we shall compare to find out who is a bigger burden on earth.\n\n \n I don't care about your list, nor do I care who you think is a bigger burden on the earth. It's good to care about the environment, but if you had your way we'd be living the stone age.\n \n \nI find it ironic that you have no concern/ compassion for Environment despite the fact that you owe your very existence to nature/ environment. \n\n \n I find it ironic that you like to comment about people speaking before they think, yet you assume that I have no concern for the environment. Just because I don't think things would be better if we were all cavemen doesn't mean I have no concern for the environment. I just recognize the much higher priorities of the economy, medical issues, and political issues. \n \n You can stop criticizing the U.S. until India requires scrubber technology for coal power plants. \n \n \nWhy do you breathe the Air? \n \n Why do you drink the Water? \n \n Why do you eat the Food that comes from Soil? - Why don't you have Computers for breakfast, lunch and dinner. \n\n \n Why do you jump to conclusions?\n \n Why do you make asinine comments like this?\n \n Why do you label anyone who doesn't hold your radical beliefs as an advocate of pollution?\n \n \nTake all your technology to the Moon - and try producing a single grain of Food without using any natural ingredient from Earth. \n\n \n Actually scientists have proven that if you bring moon soil to earth, you can grow flowers in it.\n \n \nIn the absence of Nature your grandfather would'nt have lived. \n In the absence of Nature your father would'nt have lived. \n In the absence of Nature you would'nt have lived. \n\n \n Thank you, captain obvious.\n \n \nShow some respect to Nature. \n\n \n Once again, just because I'm not a radical, \"we should all be cavemen\" kind of person doesn't mean I don't care about nature.\n \n I do advocate ways to get less oil leaks from car engines, which pollutes water more than massive oil spills. I also advocate cleaner coal if we can find it, and maybe someday we'll be able to find a replacement for coal.\n \n But to say we should all go back to living like cavemen is radical, no matter how you look at it.\n \n \nsushil_yadav\n Industrial Society Destroys Mind and Environment\n\n \n I've kept asking you what your solution to this big, horrible problem of being beyond the stone age would be, and you've not yet answered.",

   "I guess Archie has me on ignore? Is that what he does with people when they ask questions and pose challenges that he cannot answer? \n \n Again, he demonstrates his ignorance of the fact that the very \"treaty\" that he was railing against proposes to assist developing poor nations with the technology to avoid becoming what the US was in terms of a global polluter. Too bad he simply drank the Lord Monckton flavored Kool Aid without looking at the label...All the ignorance, half the guilt. \n\n \n I don't have you on ignore snakespit, I'm just busy and don't want to argue about issues I believe can't be proven either way. The treaty of copenhagen will require us to pay a 2% tax to developing countries based on our GNP which is billions of dollars per year. It is a pollution compensation tax which punishes us when we are being responsible members of the world community today.\n \n And I haven't commented on any other content of the treaty because I am too busy to read it word for word. But I don't believe that the critics of it would lie about the implications it represents by making dishonest conclusions about it. That's why I said we would have to just wait for the results of the next stage of this debate to play out in the arena of public debate. \n \n \n I can assure you that you are wrong. While it may be a damn site better than some corners of India, it is certainly not what should be termed \"pristine\".\n\n \n Really? I have no smog alerts of daily warnings about the quality of air where I live, do you? I think not, because I don't know of any cities in America where that takes place as it did back in the 1970s anymore in our country. And do you call these major cities in India some \"corners\"? Cuz I call them major population centers. Most Dangerously Plluted Cities In The World\n \n Also, your list of countries which contribute CO2 is a propaganda piece designed to condemn us unfairly based on bogus input. Each Country's Share of CO2 Emissions | Union of Concerned Scientists Are you actually accepting that if we combine the number of EU states to a comparable 300 million in population, they wont contribute emissions equal to the USA's or even greater? How convenient it is for the EU to be tallied separately when it's convenient for them and combined as a union when that perspective is beneficial for the sake of statistics. And I totally reject total emissions in metric tons which it attributes to the US or else we would see the evidence of it in the real world. And the per capita contributions are bogus also since the overall emissions numbers are untrue. \n \n There is no way that in every single 24 hour period, China and India along with any number of third world countries which have no anti pollution safeguards on their emissions producing factories spew much more tonnage of pure pollutants into the atmosphere than does the USA. Also, Our cars meet specific clean air emission requirements where as theirs don't so even in that area we are pro-active in our goal to be responsible members of the world community.",

This isn't a sin by us; what is a sin is that the powers that be are attempting to demonize our advancements rather than encouraging the availability of these luxuries to the third world countries which still lack central heating and air as well as inside plumbing, running hot and cold water and electricity in their homes. \n \n Why must the worlds recipients of these so called luxuries, which I consider to be modern day necessities be demonized as wasteful and greedy, rather than lifting up the poor of the world to enjoy the same qualities of life which we take for granted here? It makes no sense to me at all that we are somehow wrong for lifting ourselves out of abject poverty when we have done and are continuously doing everything possible to improve on the environmental advancements we were the first to invent in the first place in so many cases. \n\n What you fail to understand is that the third world nations are starting to get electricty, clean running water, heat, cars, etc to the parts of their populations that did not previously have it. How are they doing this? By the mass burning of fossil fuels mostly. Coal, oil, natural gas, etc. The \"Copenhagen Treaty\", which you protest against while making clear that you did not read, calls for the nations who have the techonology to help these developing nations provide these modern day necessities to their populations without vastly increasing the rate of pollution. This might be in our best interests, as again, water and air do not stop at our borders. \n \n \nCan't any of you see that the UN would knock us back into the dark ages rather than lift the third world out of it? All I ask is that you consider the prospects of what their agenda is when the US used to be the standard of quality of life by which the rest of the world judged their quality of life.\n\n A large part of the third world is lifting themselves out of it.

Kindly go and take a trip of all the garbage dumps, landfill sites, toxic waste/ hazardous waste sites before you say america is not destroying ecosystems.\n \n sushil_yadav\n PowerSwitch\n Industrial Society Destroys Mind and Environment\n\n \n Thank you for acknowledging my Mensa-esque IQ, an organization that I never felt I needed to join in order to prove that I was intelligent....but I digress.... ;)\n I never claimed that none of America was polluted. That was a strawman on your part. As for your claim that we are destroying the ecosystem, I would argue that we are creating new ecosystems and destroying others......just as Mother Nature does. Go ahead and take a trip to one of those garbage dumps and you will see more wildlife present than you would see in a wooded forest. Thousands of birds, rodents, insects, etc., living in once barren land. Take a boat to the water outlet of an electric power plant and count the number of fishermen there vs the middle of the lake. \n Come to the Great Lakes and you'll see the consequences of freighters dumping their bilge water into the Great Lakes. Zebra Mussels, an invasive species, have proliferated in the Great Lakes and turned the lakes crystal clear. Coupled with phosphate discharge from industry, this has enabled vegetation that was unable to get enough light to grow before, to grow now. This has led to an increase in habitat for baitfish which has led to an increase in gamefish to the point at which the lake that I fish almost daily is renown as one of the world's finest lakes for smallmouth bass, walleye and muskie. \n So, you see, while you would argue that industrialization is always bad, I would argue that it isn't. \n \n \nCaring for environment or not caring for environment is irrelevant. Excess destruction of environment happens when we have more technology. \n It is because of technology that man has managed to pump out most of the underground water which has depleted underground reserves.\n It is because of technology that man has managed to decimate all fish in the ocean.\n Pre-industrial societies destroyed ecosystems for food, clothing, shelter - and that is why they sustained for thousands and thousands of years. The fewer things we make the more sustainable we are.\n Industrial society has destroyed ecosystems for food, clothing, shelter and thousands of consumer goods like cars, computers, televisions, washing machines, refrigerators.........the list is endless.\n A society that destroys ecosystems for consumer goods in addition to food, clothing, shelter is the least sustainable and will exist for the shortest duration.\n \n sushil_yadav\n PowerSwitch\n Industrial Society Destroys Mind and Environment\n\n \n You point to a small, struggling population with a short lifespan as being preferable to a comfortable longer life. IMO, there's no comparison. And your claim that it is unsustainable is impossible to prove. As technology improves, so does man's ability to adapt to changing conditions. Two hundred years ago, we could never sustain a city the size of New York. Today, thanks to technology, we can import everything that a population that size needs from around the world. Primitive civilizations died out when crop blights occurred or nomadic tribes failed to find enough animals to sustain them. I'd say our chances of survival are much better than theirs. \n \n \nYou profile says you age is 16 - you have got to learn a lot before you understand environmental issues/ crisis.\n \n \n\n \n My profile says that I'm a 53 year old scientist and I hold the same beliefs as that 16 year old highly intelligent young man. In fact, I'm impressed with the fact that he has so much wisdom at such a young age. \n \n \nI think gansao said it best, but do you think my age makes me stupid? No credible scientists are concerned about the environment to the point where they say \"we need to destroy the industry and let millions of people die!\" Your comment on my age is simply an ad homenim.\n\n \n Well stated.",

These pollutants are persistent, bioaccumulative, and harmful to the ecosystem and human health. Because of their toxicity, the 11 IJC critical pollutants have been designated by the Great Lakes Binational Toxics Strategy as being Level I substances. These substances have been designated as requiring immediate priority, are targeted for virtual elimination, and include banned (e.g., dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and/or highly toxic substances (e.g., dioxins).

   "No disrespect Sandy but the OP is that industrial society destroys minds and environment.\n Using lemon juice instead of cillit bang and getting a water butt is hardly going to make a dent!\n\n \n Not so. Change is going to have to begin with us. If we refuse to buy the toxic - whatever - and buy eco-friendly stuff, the manufacturers will have no choice but to go along. They want our $$.\n \n I found an interesting article just now while searching 'toxic by-products of polyester manufacture': McDonough.com | Tranforming the Textile Industry - Victor Innovatex\n \n Worldwide, textile producers face other challenges. The industry that launched the Industrial Revolution has long illustrated some of its most notorious design failures. About one half of the world's wastewater problems are linked to the production of textile goods, and many of the chemicals used to dye and finish fabrics are known to harm human health. Often, the clippings from carpet or fabric mills are so loaded with dangerous chemicals they are handled like toxic waste, while the products made from these materials are considered safe for use in the home. \n \n The crisis in the textile industry reverberates widely. More than 32 million people worldwide work in clothing manufacturing plants. Millions more work in mills producing the fabrics that surround us, such as seating, drapes, and carpeting. In short, the industry's material flows affect nearly everyone: From the vast appetite of its supply chain-including one third of the production of the chemical industry-to a distribution network that spans the world, textiles are quite literally woven into the fabric of life. It's an industry crucial to the human prospect and in dire need of innovation...\n \n ...What we're talking about here is nothing less than The Next Industrial Revolution. Can textile manufacturers, with their enormous influence on the world economy, recover from their current woes to lead this transformation of human industry? We think Victor Innovatex is showing how they might. Clearly, North American apparel makers are in for an uphill battle as they compete with inexpensive imports in the commodities market. But if restructuring is the order of the day, why not reshape the textile industry following the lead of successful companies, such as Victor and Rohner, that are creating economic value with innovation, intelligence and good design? Wouldn't it be fitting and delightful if the constructive, 25-year discussion of environmental issues birthed by Rachel Carson's Silent Spring were directed by business leaders toward product quality? Imagine the textile industry renewed by the insights of ecology. Imagine industrialized nations projecting their strength through the export of life-affirming products that bring economic, social, and ecological value to the entire world. Instead of a legacy of toxic materials, low wages and ecological destruction, let's build on today's innovations and create a legacy of nutritious materials, prosperity and health for all species.\n \n Now, here is a man with a textile company who also is eco friendly and has a conscience. We can only hope there will be more to follow. If we insist on buying from him instead of his toxic competitor, there will be.\n Here's one... http://www.duraleecontract.com/fabrics/colorway.php?Colorway_id=274",

You can plant new trees on forest land only if forest land remains forest land.\n \n But this is not the case.\n \n We have got a very small planet whose circumference is just 40,000 km.\n On this small planet two-thirds of surface area is water. Included in\n the remaining land area are deserts, rocky mountains and glaciers which\n do not support vegetation.\n \n If the soil is fertile and gets rain it will grow forests, trees,\n plants, vegetation by itself.

You'd force everyone to buy organic and \"eco-friendly,\" anyway, correct? \n \n Not correct. It is important that the cost of organic and eco-friendly products be in the same ballpark as what is available now - the cheap and toxic. Cost, to most people (poor people), is the deciding factor in whether or not they buy the product...even though they would rather buy eco-friendly if they could afford it. If more vendors offer eco-friendly products and begin to take over in the market, then the price will go down. Why would this area of the market be any different than say, buying a new electronic device? Remember the cost of a CD player 20 years ago? Compare that to what you can buy one for today.\n If a product was eco-friendly and affordable people would freely choose to buy it over the toxic competitor - they would not have to be forced to buy it. In fact, I would bet a $ that if people knew the truth about what is in the products they buy and the deplorable conditions they are manufactured under, they wouldn't buy them at all.\n \n \nThe last time I checked, the planet is still here.

Thanks for not disappointing. Again, look beyond the end of your nose. There are waaaay too many humans on this planet.\n \n \n \nNot where I live. I guess I'm special.\n It just appears that way to you on the surface. I live in a beautiful rural area of the country - mountains to the east and farmland all around as far as I can see. But, I will not drink the tap water because it is toxic and I can't drink well water for the same reason. Things are not always what they appear to be. \n Even if you are lucky or wealthy enough to live in a completely non-toxic environment, do you ignore and not care what conditions are in the rest of the world?emoticon_confused \n Again, look past the end of your nose.\n \n \n \nWhy is that a problem? If I want to see the stars, I go to the planetarium, or out to the desert.\n Until last week, I was able to see the stars at night from my back yard. Then they turned on the flood lights on the new fire station and now I can't even see the yard for the blinding glare of the lights. Totally unnecessary light pollution.\n So, you can afford a car and admission to a planetarium? What about all the poor people you worry that eco-friendly people hate? All of the millions of poor people who live in inner cities across the globe can't afford the luxury of going somewhere to see the stars.\n You really need to look beyond the end of your nose and think about how the other half are being forced to live.\n \n \n \nAgain, what's the problem?

I don't know what is in the markets of your country but here, you can now find plenty of 'organic' choices on the shelves. The more people are aware of the benifits of buying these products the more these companies will grow in size and number...which will put them in a place where they can compete in price with the already established 'bad' companies.\n \n The progress made by the human race, as far as industry and agriculture is concerned, was pretty much inevitable. The choices we made and the methods used were not always the best choice but, we are now seeing the negative results of these bad choices and I think over all, people are wanting to see a healthy change in the world.

If not, I mostly do without.\n Making people aware of a bad problem is a good thing but, you must also offer solutions and more importantly, those who are doing good for humanity and the environment must get top billing. If you only talk about the bad and ignore the good, the bad is getting all of your energy. Instead, focus on the positive and it will multiply. emoticon_idea\n \n The main trouble with industry is that it has been accustomed to making a profit on unhealthy products and cheap labor (from moving to countries like YOURS, by the way emoticon_angry). If you people would refuse to work under such conditions, the companies would have no choice but to change their ways. Wages would go up and so would the quality of the products we buy.

If you tell these people to stop buying 'stuff', then you will have a tremendous number of people out of work- they will lose the jobs they have making all this stuff! The only way to solve the problem is to reduce the population to a point where there are enough meaningful jobs for everyone and no unnecessary jobs that exist simply to keep people working...and flooding the market with unnecessary 'stuff'. There is a reason why the stuff you buy today falls apart soon after you buy it: planned obsolescence - it keeps people working in their jobs.\n \n \nIn the last 50 years a lot of efforts have been made to control/ reduce population [ and these efforts should also continue in future].

Do you think it is possible for modern society do do that now? Hardly. Overpopulation is exactly WHY society changed from wandering clans to stable communities: too many people and not enough naturally-occurring food sources. Instead of walking 50 miles in a day to find food, people figured out how to plant more crops per acre in order to feed more people.\n Overpopulation is the cause of all our problems today concerning the eco-system and over-consumerism.

Economic liberalization, including reduced controls on foreign trade and investment, began in the early 1990s and has served to accelerate the country's growth, which has averaged more than 7% per year since 1997. India's diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a multitude of services. Slightly more than half of the work force is in agriculture, but services are the major source of economic growth, accounting for more than half of India's output, with only one-third of its labor force. India has capitalized on its large educated English-speaking population to become a major exporter of information technology services and software workers. An industrial slowdown early in 2008, followed by the global financial crisis, led annual GDP growth to slow to 6.1% in 2009, still second highest growth in the world among major economies. India escaped the brunt of the global financial crisis because of cautious banking policies and a relatively low dependence on exports for growth. Domestic demand, driven by purchases of consumer durables and automobiles, has re-emerged as a key driver of growth, as exports have fallen since the global crisis started. India's fiscal deficit increased substantially in 2008 due to fuel and fertilizer subsidies, a debt waiver program for farmers, a job guarantee program for rural workers, and stimulus expenditures. The government abandoned its deficit target and allowed the deficit to reach 6.8% of GDP in FY10. Nevertheless, as shares of GDP, both government spending and taxation are among the lowest in the world. The government has expressed a commitment to fiscal stimulus in FY10, and to deficit reduction the following two years. It has increased the pace of privatization of government-owned companies, partly to offset the deficit. India's long term challenges include widespread poverty, inadequate physical and social infrastructure, limited employment opportunities, and insufficient access to basic and higher education. Over the long-term, a growing population and changing demographics will only exacerbate social, economic, and environmental problems. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/in.html\n \n I repeat: What is your country doing about the overpopulation, environmental and over-consumerism problems? emoticon_emb",

   "Here's one for the road:\n \n There are close to a billion people in India and this has a severe impact on the environment. I try to be as objective in this travel log as possible, and therefore I must also write about some of the less beautiful sides of India. Yes, this is not paradise.\n \n Pollution is the major problem, and one that is very obvious wherever you go.\n \n 1. Air\n \n Everywhere you walk you are attacked by the fumes of auto scooters, buses and other kinds of polluting machines. After a short walk you sneeze and your handkerchief is filled with black soot. Sometimes you can even see the smog hanging around the city, especially in Chennai and the dusty cities of Southern Tamil Nadu. We only found one single place where it was nice to smell the air: on the backwaters between Kumarakom and Allappey (see day 17)\n \n 2. Water\n \n Water from the tap is definitely not fit for consumption by Westerners. It takes a steel stomach or years of immunization to survive that. So we drink packaged mineral water and take very good precautions when taking a shower or brushing our teeth. The sea water looked ok, but all the small canals and big rivers smell of sulpher.\n \n Today we heard an amazing story on Indian television. In Mumbai the sea water turned for a couple of hours from salty water into sweet water! Many people thought this was a miracle, and started drinking the stuff (I can assure you that the water looked as dark and disgusting as you can possible imagine). Although the government warned everybody that is was probably some toxic waste from a nearby factory, thousands of people flocked to the sea to drink the water and carry it home in buckets, bottles and even plastic bags. \n \n 3. Noise\n \n This is my major concern. My ears constantly hurt from the barrage of noises, ranging from the incessant horns that sound on the cars to the Bollywood music that you can hear on street corners, on buses, in supermarkets. I honestly believe that the Indian horn is directly connected to the brake AND accelerator so that it constantly beeps. When we take buses or go to the movies we have to put in our ear plugs if we don't want to damage our hearing permanently. And the fans (which you need at night to keep the temperature down) sound just like an helicopter.\n \n 4. Smell\n \n The smell is sometimes terrible, especially when we come near a canal or we see someone who urinates next to us (something that happens at least once every hour). There are also many nice smells (of spices for example) but it all gets blown away when people use the world as their personal toilet.\n People also spit a lot. First they consume a lot of chewing tobacco (more than 60% of all tobacco consumed in India is used for chewing). And then you have the betle nuts that leave a thick red slime in your mouth and produce wonderful results when men spit on the walls or pavement.\n \n Pollution - Madurai, India Travel Blog\n \n I don't know of ANY place in the US that would come close to this description. emoticon_xdonno",

Now the only thing you need to ask yourself is if you wish to be a part of the solution rather than a blithering lunatic that people laugh at.\n\n \n Do you want me to take you seriously with the kind of nonsense you have written above - clean energy, green energy, renewable energy - all oxymorons.\n \n First of all you need machines/ gadgets/ appliances to produce the so-called clean energy, green energy, renewable energy. This means you first destroy ecosystems to make machines that are going to produce energy. And then what happens when you have produced energy - what do you do with it? You use this energy to run consumer goods which are produced by destroying ecosystems. So we are back to square one - we are still running a consumerist society - it is consumerism that is causing extra destruction of environment.\n \n You are proposing the same old insanity : Bring this technology, Bring that technology - Bring this technology, Bring that technology.\n \n This is what people have been promoting as a solution for the last 50 years - and in this period the environmental crisis has gone from bad to worse to critical/ catastrophic. \n \n Technology has killed ecosystems.\n \n Technology has led to over-exploitation of ecosystems.\n \n But this insane society does'nt abandon the craze for technology - it wants more technology - new technology, better technology, advanced technology.\n \n Bring this technology, Bring that technology - Bring this technology, Bring that technology.\n \n \n A man is shooting at some people.\n \n They plead with him - stop, don't shoot, your gun is killing us.\n \n The man replies - don't worry, I will change the gun.\n \n The man changes gun [ new technology, better technology, advanced technology] - and continues to shoot.\n \n \n sushil_yadav\n Industrial Society Destroys Mind and Environment",

   "While I've been disconnected from cyber-world forums, I've been reading books - bound pages of white paper with black ink text that you actually hold in your hand. What a novel invention. emoticon_xclown\n \n I read The Riverkeepers and Crimes Against Nature by Bobby Kennedy Jr., Silent Spring by Rachel Carson and have just started The Hudson by Robert Boyle.\n There are others, referenced in these books, that I've added to my reading list.\n \n I wonder if Sushil has read any of them? I doubt it. Too bad.emoticon_cry\n \n Sushil does have a valid claim: too much 'stuff' and too many people but, his cause is not accurate and his solution is non-existent and he is pointing the finger of guilt at the wrong people.\n \n The fact of the matter is, if the average intelligent person is given a choice between an eco-friendly product and a toxic one, they will undoubtedly choose the eco-friendly one. The trouble is, most people don't know that the stuff they buy is toxic - and there aren't many options available and those that are available are usually expensive.\n \n Even still, when people have joined together in an effort to stop the toxic polluting of the Earth's air, water and soil, they are, 99.9% of the time, tossed aside as being 'extreemists' or nut-jobs' or, 'anti-America' by the industries who are creating these toxic products.\n And, as we all know, these companies are running the government and the agencies who are supposed to be protecting the people and the environment. emoticon_angry So, that leaves us, The People, with the XXXXXX end of the stick - literally.\n \n Reading Silent Spring, I was shocked and appalled at what our government did to it's own citicens and environment in the mid-1950's. I was born in 1957 nad I can't help but wonder if my neighborhood was one of those that was sprayed with DDT to 'eradicate' the Gypsy Moths (which actually killed nearly everything but the moths). \n \n I know my hometown was one of the first to be experimented on with water fluoridation - which was basically a government/military/industry run operation to quickly and completely dispose of industrial toxic waste.\n \n I wonder (and I will be doing more research on the issue) what was going on at the time (1950's) that caused the US to have the need to dispose of billions of tons of pesticides over most of the country. I also want to know who these chemical companies were and who was in charge of the various government agencies responsible for approving these mass-poisonings. My guess is the military had stockpiled these chemicals to use in the war and when they didn't need them, they had to devise a way to use them up - and get paid for them. So, they sold them to the States.\n \n I will satisfy my curiosity as to 'who' but I already know the 'why': MONEY.\n \n Bobby Kennedy spoke of two basic types of people: the Boomers and the Nesters.\n The Nesters are those folks who care about their neighbors, their property, the physical and environmental health of their families, neighbors, community and of their environment.\n The Boomers don't.\n The Boomers are men who run businesses that destroy all of the above - for their own greedy profit. Like General Electric did in the Hudson Valley and others have done and continue to do around the country - and the globe now - they move into a poor community with the promise of jobs and personal wealth only to take everything they can and then abandon the area when they've used up the resources, leaving behind more poverty and pollution than there ever was to begin with.\n \n As Kennedy pointed out, when the locals complain, they are dismissed not only by the offending industry but by their very own government and Judicial system because their government is owned by the industry.\n \n Then there are the masses of the public who depend on the media and their government to tell them the truth - those who don't have the resources or the time to do their own investigation on the Internet (like meemoticon_love ).\n \n And, you have the medical industry selling drugs for the chemical industry.\n \n There is one thing that I simply cannot understand: Why is it that people can't see that it is the chemicals that are making them sick and the very same chemical companies are offering the 'cure'? The chemical companies are making profits hand-over-fist, first, selling us toxic chemical products that are making us sick and then selling us the chemical 'cure'. It is a fine line they walk - to make us just sick enough so we can still work to pay them but not sick enough that we die...where is the profit in that? emoticon_xkill\n \n Anyway...\n I still think the main problem in the world is human over-population. Nature strives to maintain an equilibrium and right now, humans have thrown a huge monkey-wrench into the works. Pun intended. emoticon_emb\n \n I also think that if the population is kept in check and people continue to become educated about maintaining a healthy environment - and buy more eco-friendly products and less toxic stuff - there may be hope for us yet. emoticon_xbouncer",

Gilgamesh defies the gods and cuts down the forest, and in return the gods say they will curse Sumeria with fire (or possibly drought). By 2100 BC, soil erosion and salt buildup have devastated agriculture. One Sumerian wrote that the \"earth turned white.\" Civilization moved north to Babylonia and Assyria. Again, deforestation becomes a factor in the rise and subsequent fall of these civilizations. (Perlin, 1991). \n \n 2700 BC -- Some of the first laws protecting the remaining forests decreed in Ur.
