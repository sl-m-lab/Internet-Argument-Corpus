Just because we suspect we came from similar primates, humans were still created, right? Does evolution necessarily disprove the Bible? Can someone explain to me where this correlation comes from?\n \n Leviathan\n\n \n Evolution...\n It doesn't disprove God, because God exists. Even evolutionaries, who don't believe in God can't say that the Bible disproves God. I don't know if this is what you meant to say. I can only respond to what you write.\n \n Further, I reject the notion that you can separate the Bible from God as you have done. The Bible is that which is inspired by God - through the Holy Spirit.\n \n Evolution - It attempts to disprove Him (or rather; the people believing in it attempt to use evolution to disprove Him), by reducing His presence to non-existence. And, by undermining the central message of the Bible.\n \n God revealed Himself as a Father, (He is using human terms so that we might know Him - and doesn't denote any physical traits such as we might associate with being a 'male').\n \n He revealed Himself over time as Man grew in understanding - as you don't teach your baby legal studies until the child has developed an understanding of other things first.\n \n Man recorded these continual revelations through the books that together became the Bible.\n \n Jesus referred to God as a creator (Mat 19:4). Jesus believed that God created the world. Jesus believed that He was sent by God to redeem man (Galatians 3:14, Titus 2:14, and divers other passages -see below for some more in deatil) God made a promise to Israel and He kept that promise. Evolution undermines this because it claims that we are but apes that got 'lucky'. Theistic evolutionaries must re-write whole swathes of the Bible; not just Genesis. All the prophetic books talk of the saviour who will come. Why did He come if we were just 'clever apes'? The Bible says that He came to save the world - to rectify it for the sin Adam committed.\n \n His Church, that Jesus established has taught that God did certain things. Created life etc.\n \n Along come people uncomfortable with a notion of personal responsibility* who start undermining all these teachings.\n \n Many evolutionaries will quibble that the origins of the universe have nothing to do with evolution. To a point this is true. Technically evolution is about the change of life, speciation etc. However, it is to be noted that many evolutionaries have a more all-encompassing notion that also excludes God - such as the Big Bang and theories about how the Solar System, the earth, life itself, all came into being without God.\n \n Furthermore, Christian tradition has maintained other things; Adam caused the Fall of Man by introducing death/sin. Jesus came to us to rectify this, to bring us back to God. Thus the story of Adam, is important to the story of Jesus. Orthodoxy looks to Jesus as the 2nd Adam (in some ways).\n Post 4 of \"Religion and Science\" I wrote (which itself is a reprint of an earlier posting I made)**...\n \n \"The connexion of Adam to Jesus is always being made in Christianity. \n Irenaeus (Bishop of Lyons c.177-200) says \"in the first Adam we offended God by not performing his command; in the second Adam* we have been reconciled, becoming 'obedient unto death'. Adversus Haereses v.xvi.3 \n Fellowship with God is light and life...separation from God is death.\" Ibid v.xxvii.2 \n Right down to our own day... \n \"A knowledge of the beginning and end of all things is essential for us to understand the purpose of our existence here on this earth, and what lies beyond it\" Fr.Seraphim Rose's commentary on St. Symeon The New Theologian's \"The First-Created Man.\" \n To undermine Genesis is to undermine Jesus. \n *The Second Adam is Jesus. And it is a literal Adam they talk of.\n Thus the position of Adam is crucial if Christians are to understand why Jesus came.\n But, it can't be made more clear than... \n \"No one should think that the Creation of Six Days is allegory...\" St. Ephraim the Syrian (quoted in Fr. Seraphim Rose, \"Genesis, Creation and Early Man: The Orthodox Christian Vision p86).\"\n \n Many people who believe in evolution and Jesus must form new theories as to why Jesus came. One poster who I've asked time and again refuses to elaborate on these notions, but I imagine he's formed some new theory to get around 2,000 years of teaching.\n \n They follow the Protestant notion of interpreting the Bible for themselves; a notion that is only very recent in relative terms to the age of the Christian Church.\n \n The same Church that put the Bible together teaches us how to interpret the Bible. They put the Bible together, the Bible was created for the Church. Many Churches run the other way around, claiming to be created by the Bible.\n \n One only needs to have a basic understanding of the history of the Bible; to read the other books of the Christian Church that pre-dates it, to understand that the Church, as established by Jesus was established by Him, in a particular way to stop people interpreting His teachings for themselves - so as to avoid them misrepresenting the Truth.\n \n \n *Free Will comes from God.\n From evolutionaries you can reduce everything to the way we have evolved/DNA/chemicals etc. Personal responsibility is thrown out the door - on another post on homosexuality the typical argument was raised that homosexuals 'are born that way' - again denying a personal choice.... reducing something to a compulsion.\n \n **Post 74 of \"Failed Biblical Prophecies?\" I have repeated the quote above, and added information.\n \n \n Jesus came to redeem us. To save us.\n Luke 2:11\n Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ[ 2:11 Or Messiah. \"The Christ\" (Greek) and \"the Messiah\" (Hebrew) both mean \"the Anointed One\"; also in verse 26.] the Lord. \n \n John 4:42\n They said to the woman, \"We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.\" \n \n Ephesians 5:23\n For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. \n \n \n NB all Biblical quotes unless otherwise cited are from www.biblegateway.com and are from the New International Version of the Bible.",

Does liking or not liking something make it any less or more true?\n\n \n I don't believe so. You made an assertion about general beliefs, and want to believe those of the US reflect the world at large. Wanting to believe this doesn't mean it's true :)\n \n \nDo you think supporters of evolution who advocate evolution because they don?t like the idea of a god are using valid reasoning? If the answer is no then why bring up the possible conclusions/moral stances drawn from evolution (regardless of how many people actually subscribe to the conclusions)?\n\n \n The 'reasoning' is only valid in so far as it makes them comfortable atheists, but as it's not reflective of the truth - that there is a God, it's not 'valid'\n \n \nIf the answer is yes? well I don?t want to have a discussion with someone who has such an unrealistic view of reality. \n\n \n Cool\n \n \nto clarify, you wouldn?t blame Christianity because the problem is not in the core teachings of Christianity, but actually the person doing the interpreting? correct?\n\n \n Yes\n \n \nIf this is correct, then why not be consistent, and instead of putting the blame on atheism, put the blame on power hungry leaders (who have existed since long before atheism was an acceptable religious stance (rather lack of religious stance)) who just want justification for their actions?\n\n \n Well I can't say atheists act a certain way because there's an atheistic bible which teaches them to do something, I can however look at evolutionary theory resplendant with examples of dog eat dog mentality, and I see these people acting accordingly - kill or be killed\n \n But I do take your point that I can't judge all atheists by what some of them do. However, as I say, there's no commandment or prohibition that I can point to that says \"Thou Shall Not Kill\" which is typically an example of what atheists agree on in order to be termed atheists.\n \n \nyou?ve shown some people have used survival of the fittest to justify their acquisition of power, and the repression of others. This was happening since before the idea of survival of the fittest was ever suggested, and I can guarantee you there will be other ideas that are used to justify other forms of oppression. \n\n \n Indeed, evil's always been with us. Now you've got science to support it... and you undermine what little is left of Christian principles along the way.\n \n \nBut to make any significant point you have to show that people have used atheism to justify even more wrongs than pretty much any other widespread belief system. \n\n \n Over a period of time, religion wins out, but for the present, atheists have caught up and out-stripped anything Christians have done.

Maybe there is a better way to get to Sacramento, but why change something that works fine? \n\n \n Are you a public servant by profession? I thought Americans were about achieving best practice.\n \n \nyou make it sound like naturalistic explanations existed for everything, and then one day an enlightened person came along and suggested god was behind it.

Is your problem with evolution or abiogenesis? If it?s the latter then do you accept evolution? if it?s the former then why not focus on it?\n\n \n As I say, it's an all-encompassing atheistic belief to rule God out. Thus there's a big bang theory to take God out of creation. Abiogensis to take God out of the origins of life etc.\n \n Strictly speaking evolution has nothing to do with the other things, but I've been to so many web-sites of evolutionaries that have links to either external info, or internal info about planet formation etc, that one has to be blind not to see it.\n \n \nTo me it sounded like your first comment meant you won?t tolerate ANY religions, while the second means you won?t tolerate ALL religions.

If you don?t think there is a common trend then prove me wrong. smug responses are not proof. \n\n \n I'm not attempting to be smug. I apologise if I seem that way - I'm just attempting to demonstrate that your assertion based on US figures is not somthing you should assume to be representative of the rest of the world - and also secularist nations such as those under the former soviets, and in China, North Korea etc who all officially debased religion - taught evolution as a viable alternative to believing in God. This seems to me to be 'self-evident'; due to the tremendous numbers these nations combine.\n \n I don't think conspiracy is the right word. I've read the posts of other people on this forum.

However, I have forwarded outstanding examples such as Hitler, Stalin and Mao, oh, and the Kims of North Korea, Pol Pot etc who combined have killed more people that Christians. They believed in naturalistic evolution as well.\n \n \nBut I do take your point that I can't judge all atheists by what some of them do.

The only ?typical? example of what an atheist needs to believe is that there is no god, or any ?god? is inconsequential. \n Atheism is not a religion in and of itself. it?s generally a lack of religious orientation.\n\n \n I'm just saying that to be a Christian -there are certain laws/morals etc that we can all look to and examine. Atheists, by their very nature don't have this... they don't have a common rule of ethics. There is no atheist 'bible' for me to show a law like \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\" as there is for Christians.\n \n When a Christian sins, you can measure his/her actions up against his/her beliefs. A comparative study of atheists provides no such measure as anyone believing in no God -whether they're a law abiding person, or a psychopath is an atheist.\n \n I am merely acknowledging the difficulty of generalising about the behaviour of all atheists - however, BECAUSE there is no standard of morals, you can have a psychopath who sits well within the scope of atheism. The same can not be said of Christianity. You can't have a psychopath who is easily described as a Christian - but you can have a pyschopath who can also be a comfortable atheist.\n \n \nIndeed, evil's always been with us. Now you've got science to support it... and you undermine what little is left of Christian principles along the way.\n\n \n \nStill conjecture. Prove it. \n\n \n Nazi science is a classic example. It took the dog eat dog mentality of evolution to a 'logical' ends. On a lesser scale are theories of Social Engineering / Social Darwinism that also paly on this mentality.\n \n The social engineering of the Soviets is another. The Church was actively persecuted by Communist nations, and traditional morals were undermined. Originally in the Soviet Union incest was made legal (until Stalin changed this).\n \n \nOver a period of time, religion wins out, but for the present, atheists have caught up and out-stripped anything Christians have done.

Thus my statement about no priest inventing it runs true - I am speculating again, that it was an atheist not believing in the intrinsic worth of human life that invented it.\n \n \n Are you a public servant by profession? I thought Americans were about achieving best practice.\n\n \n \nI don?t understand this.

You can start by showing that supporters of these theories and hypotheses generally don?t believe in a god. \n\n \n I have mentioned Dawkins, who is described \"A devout atheist, Dawkins has done much to promote atheism and scepticism. In fact, his anti-religious sentiments sometimes overshadow his scientific contributions. He holds a passionate revulsion of what he calls fatuous religious prejudices, which he believes lead to evil. In particular,  the Roman Catholic Church has attracted his ire. \"It is one of the forces for evil in the world, mainly because of the powerful influence it has over the minds of children,\" he has said. \"Regarding the accusations of sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests, deplorable and disgusting as those abuses are, they are not so harmful to the children as the grievous mental harm in bringing up the child Catholic in the first place.\"\n http://www.betterhumans.com/Errors/index.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/Search_Engine_Links/2002/searchEngineLink.article.2002-05-21-7.aspx\n \n I don't know who 'Keith' is, but he gives an evolution/atheist page at http://umcc.ais.org/~idplmal/evolv-2.htm. There's another by Howard Dean, who he is, I don't know.\n \n The Atheist alliance (http://www.atheistalliance.org/internet/net_evolution.html) lists dozens of evolutionary sources, and one creationist page; with the comment \"keep your friends close, and your enemies closer... scientific creationism online\"\n \n I have also posted on this subject before, other sites of interest on this topic including one vile site that made great use of the religious people behind September 11. I don't know how many sites to cite but I'm sure you'll say that they only represent a minority :)\n \n There is a huge body of people who believe that we 'progressed' only with the reduction of the influence of religion. On this forum alone I've read this a number of times... Lurch for example saying that religion held the anti-progressive belief in a flat-earth, and Hank also argued for some time about the trial against science-hero Galileo against the evil and backward Church.\n \n I know of these trends. There's even a corpus of work set out to debunk these theories. I've got one a book called \"Christianity on Trial\".\n \n \nAs I say, it's an all-encompassing atheistic belief to rule God out. Thus there's a big bang theory to take God out of creation. Abiogenesis to take God out of the origins of life etc.\n\n \n \nprove that this is an exclusive atheistic belief.\n\n \n Which bit?\n \n As abiogenesis does not involve God, he's already not included.\n \n The same isn't so clear-cut for the Big Bang with some theistic people believing that He started it. However, there are scientific explanations to replace God here too.\n \n \n Strictly speaking evolution has nothing to do with the other things, but I've been to so many web-sites of evolutionaries that have links to either external info, or internal info about planet formation etc, that one has to be blind not to see it.\n\n \n \nso isn?t your argument with people why try to combine evolution with abiogenesis and the big bang? IMO those people are wrong too? but why paint this caricature on people when you KNOW the caricature is a misrepresentation?\n\n \n You say it's a caricature.\n \n I'm saying that at a great many web-sites that are pro-evolutionary they also provide links for other godless theories such as the big bang, abiogenesis etc. If you got a hint of a 'conspiracy' theory, here is where I'd have expected you to see it... otherwise it's a bit of a major coincidence that so many carry these links.\n \n \n I don't think the notion of rights granted to and by all is considered - it is after-all your value judgment that this (a western notion) should be the means of judging. What makes this right?\n\n \n \nthe society mutually agreeing on it makes it right for them.\n\n \n So therefore the things you disagree with; such as child marriages or female genital mutilation are okay, within their societies? Shame on us westerners for condemning them, hey?\n \n \n For me, what is right is what God teaches to be right. It is an absolute, I would be one of those nasty people who go to another culture and tell them to stop genital mutilation because it's wrong.\n\n \n \nand what should be done about the lesser evils? Such as people subscribing to a religion different from your own?\n\n \n Read Romans 2.\n \n An Orthodox site says \"According to His boundless mercy and righteousness god deals with those who are outside the Church and the Apostle forbids us to concern ourselves with the judgements of God concerning such people.\"\n www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/doctrine_ext.htm\n \n I can tell you that female genital mutilation is wrong but because it is not a religious issue how God judges them is up to Him.\n \n As to people who don't believe in God, well obviously I believe that believing in God is right; but again, how God judges them is up to God.\n \n I have been given rules to live by; love thy neighbour etc. I also believe that love extends to the point of me arguing against things such as genital mutilation.\n \n I'd also like to take a moment to wish you and other readers of this post a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year (hope it's not too early to do this in your culture) :)",

   " This seems to me to be 'self-evident'; due to the tremendous numbers these nations combine.\n\n \n what seems to be self evident may not actually be right. You'll have to provide stronger proof than that before your assertions can be taken seriously. \n \n \nAnd in this light, I don't believe that you've demonstrated that evolution is not a conspiracy to explain away God in the US. You've demonstrated that a large number of people in the US believe in both evolution and God. \n\n \n how else can it be interpreted? You say evolution is a way for atheists to explain away god. How can this be true if most supporters of evolution support the existence of a god too?\n \n \nThey believed in naturalistic evolution as well. \n\n \n Correlation does not prove causation. They were also all men. Is there something inherently evil about being a man... well possibly, but probably not. You'll have to draw more of a connection between atheism and evil doings than this to have any case. \n \n \nAtheists, by their very nature don't have this... they don't have a common rule of ethics. There is no atheist 'bible' for me to show a law like \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\" as there is for Christians.\n\n \n why is this a problem? There is no \"Handbook for being a Man\" thank explains how men should behave. A person could eat little children and still fall within the guidelines (the totally absent guidelines) of being a man. Does this make it immoral to be a man? Of course not, because being male isn't a source of morals or ethics. It's just a condition. Being atheist may imply that someone will not hold the morals of a particular god fearing religion, however this does not mean they have a total lack of morals and ethics. Religions do not have a monopoly on morals... and if you think otherwise, cite some data to support this assertion. \n \n \n A comparative study of atheists provides no such measure as anyone believing in no God -whether they're a law abiding person, or a psychopath is an atheist.\n\n \n a man can be a law abiding person, or a psychopath and not conflict with the natural standards of being a man. This does not make being a man wrong. \n \n \nBECAUSE there is no standard of morals, you can have a psychopath who sits well within the scope of atheism. The same can not be said of Christianity. You can't have a psychopath who is easily described as a Christian - but you can have a pyschopath who can also be a comfortable atheist. \n\n \n ... and a comfortable male, female, blonde, brunette, adult, child... etc.\n \n \n \n \n \nNazi science is a classic example...\n\n \n there are people who are viewed as evil and got their evil ideas from Christian teachings. I say this evil behavior lies in people, and belief structures they use to justify their actions are just used for justification... and not the actual source of their evil ideas. \n \n Until you can show that evil behavior has a stronger tie to atheism than any other belief structure, you're just drawing conclusions from anecdotal evidence. \n \n \nIndeed, and with atheists able to believe in a whole range of morals/social modes, you're playing a lottery with what sort of person you're going to end up with.\n\n \n again the problem is we can apply the same exact complaints about being a man. But of course you can't say this about Christians because if you do it can be argued that they are not actually Christians. It's a no true Scotsman fallacy... but I'm not trying to make an argument for or against any characteristic about a person. I say that there are some people who just need any kind of justification to commit their morally corrupt acts. Christianity has the luxury of saying \"well that person isn't actually a Christian, and so Christianity isn't to blame\" when a self proclaimed Christian murders thousands. Unfortunately characteristics such as atheism and being a man are not able to do this. \n \n \nI don't think that VX nerve gas was invented in a 'moral' vacuum as you seem to suggest (believing only that it's application has a moral factor). Thus my statement about no priest inventing it runs true\n\n \n I believe vx nerve gas was accidentally stumbled upon when new pesticides were being developed. So, yes your comment about no priest inventing it is true... but how is this relevant to anything we're discussing? Do you know of nay Christian priests initiating or supporting any actions that we would find immoral today?\n \n \nI am speculating again, that it was an atheist not believing in the intrinsic worth of human life that invented it.\n\n \n speculation duly noted. Feel free to show that atheists generally actually hold this belief (that humans are worthless... your personal speculations do not count). \n \n \n \nWhich bit?\n \n As abiogenesis does not involve God, he's already not included.\n \n The same isn't so clear-cut for the Big Bang with some theistic people believing that He started it. However, there are scientific explanations to replace God here too.\n\n \n I said exclusive atheistic belief. Gravity does not try to exclude any god, but you don't have a problem with the theory of gravity because it doesn't contradict your particular opinion of what you think god is. Atheists and religious folk alike believe in gravity... in addition the religious folk (obviously) believe in God... so the theory of gravity is obviously not some ploy to explain away God. Atheists and religious folk alike believe in evolution... in addition the religious folk (obviously) believe in God... so the theory of evolution is (hopefully) obviously not some ploy to explain away God. \n \n You just seem to have a problem with it because it contradicts your particular idea of what God is. \n \n \nSo therefore the things you disagree with; such as child marriages or female genital mutilation are okay, within their societies? Shame on us westerners for condemning them, hey?\n\n \n why didn't you look at my particular responses to these two situations? You are taking what I said out of context. \n \n I'll copy and paste exactly what I said in post number 9\n \n \n not ok since it's been generally agreed upon children are impressionable, and generally don't know yet what is good for them, and therefore any \"willingness\" is questionable. Genital mutilation: again, if the person is willing then it's more along the lines of self mutilation, and in that case it's their choice.\n\n \n Merry Christmas to you to... bla I guess I should get to my Christmas shopping some time soon.",

As I said, most supporters of evolution exist in atheistic nations such as North Korea, China, Vietnam, and even in de-religious regimes of the former Soviet boc and Cuba. God isn't taught. If God's not being taught, and only evolution is, then it does seem to me to be self-evident of exclusion.\n \n \nThey believed in naturalistic evolution as well. \n\n \n \nCorrelation does not prove causation. They were also all men. Is there something inherently evil about being a man? well possibly, but probably not. You?ll have to draw more of a connection between atheism and evil doings than this to have any case. \n\n \n I actually believe that the state of man is not moral neutral. But you seem to suggest this, that some things not intrinsic to man. And in doing so, I think you've provided the answer. By you showing that the state of man has no inherent evilness, then we can ignore this as a cause for evil. It seems logically we must therefore look for other causes. One that springs to minds is a person's belief system. If you believe murder is okay, then you'll probably murder. If you are an atheist you MIGHT believe that man has worth - but this is not intrinsic to being an atheist.\n \n If you don't believe man has any intrinsic value, then it is easier to make man more disposable - as the Nazis did; where they tried to rid categories of men that they believed were worth less; mental patients, mentally handicapped, Gypsies, Jews, homosexuals etc.\n \n Further...\n \n Atheists, by their very nature don't have this... they don't have a common rule of ethics. There is no atheist 'bible' for me to show a law like \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\" as there is for Christians.\n\n \n \nwhy is this a problem? There is no ?Handbook for being a Man? thank explains how men should behave. A person could eat little children and still fall within the guidelines (the totally absent guidelines) of being a man. Does this make it immoral to be a man? Of course not, because being male isn?t a source of morals or ethics. It?s just a condition. Being atheist may imply that someone will not hold the morals of a particular god fearing religion, however this does not mean they have a total lack of morals and ethics. Religions do not have a monopoly on morals? and if you think otherwise, cite some data to support this assertion.\n\n \n Again you are saying that the essentialism of man is some kind of moral neutral; that being man is just a condition.\n \n I for one don't believe that religions have a monopoly on morals. Atheists have morals. However, these are based on their own beliefs, which as I pointed out, can quite happily accommodate being a mass-murderer, and still be an atheist. There is to me something intrinsically wrong then with a belief system that so happily accommodates such things.\n \n With Christianity, mass murder is wrong. Some one may mistakenly use texts to justify their actions - but we can judge their actions against the texts. Atheism has no such texts and thus who/what do we judge their actions by? Other subjective believers and their belief systems?\n \n When you feel mad that an injustice is happening, either\n a) it's being done by a Christian (or other religious person) - in which case you can point to what the Christian (or other religion) believes in and judge them according to if they're going against their own belief system\n or\n b) it's an atheist, in which case you can only hope to prevail upon them that your subjective opinion is more rational than their subjective opinion - and even then - what right have you to believe that your subjective opinion is better than there's?\n \n \n A comparative study of atheists provides no such measure as anyone believing in no God -whether they're a law abiding person, or a psychopath is an atheist.\n\n \n \na man can be a law abiding person, or a psychopath and not conflict with the natural standards of being a man. This does not make being a man wrong.\n\n \n I don't disagree. That's not what I'm arguing. I'm not arguing about the essence of what it is to be a man, I'm arguing against atheism.\n \n And against evolution -because it excludes God and without God you get subjective morals.\n \n \n BECAUSE there is no standard of morals, you can have a psychopath who sits well within the scope of atheism. The same can not be said of Christianity. You can't have a psychopath who is easily described as a Christian - but you can have a psychopath who can also be a comfortable atheist. \n\n \n \n? and a comfortable male, female, blonde, brunette, adult, child? etc.\n\n \n Again, how do you judge 'a man'. You judge them by their actions and the beliefs that lead to these actions. Being a man is not a crime. I am looking at belief systems and actions.\n \n \n Nazi science is a classic example?\n\n \n \nthere are people who are viewed as evil and got their evil ideas from Christian teachings. I say this evil behaviour lies in people, and belief structures they use to justify their actions are just used for justification? and not the actual source of their evil ideas. \n Until you can show that evil behaviour has a stronger tie to atheism than any other belief structure, you?re just drawing conclusions from anecdotal evidence. \n\n \n Indeed, but with a bad Christian we can weigh these things up against Christian teachings. As science has no 'morals' then we can't do the same for Nazi science. I can say that a Christian acting bad is doing so despite being a Christian. With Nazi science - nazis used the science to justify their actions... and as you can't say that it's intrinsically good or bad, then you can't condemn them, unless you refer to religious morals... you could of course base your opinion on your own atheistic morals but who's to say your interpretation as an atheist is any less or better than there's because as I said, atheism quite comfortably embraces all sorts of moral groupings.\n \n \n Indeed, and with atheists able to believe in a whole range of morals/social modes, you're playing a lottery with what sort of person you're going to end up with.\n\n \n \nagain the problem is we can apply the same exact complaints about being a man. But of course you can?t say this about Christians because if you do it can be argued that they are not actually Christians. It?s a no true Scotsman fallacy? but I?m not trying to make an argument for or against any characteristic about a person. I say that there are some people who just need any kind of justification to commit their morally corrupt acts. Christianity has the luxury of saying ?well that person isn?t actually a Christian, and so Christianity isn?t to blame? when a self proclaimed Christian murders thousands. Unfortunately characteristics such as atheism and being a man are not able to do this.\n\n \n See above.\n \n \nI don't think that VX nerve gas was invented in a 'moral' vacuum as you seem to suggest (believing only that it's application has a moral factor). Thus my statement about no priest inventing it runs true\n\n \n \nI believe vx nerve gas was accidentally stumbled upon when new pesticides were being developed. So, yes your comment about no priest inventing it is true? but how is this relevant to anything we?re discussing? Do you know of nay Christian priests initiating or supporting any actions that we would find immoral today?\n\n \n It is actually a bad example. I should have gone straight for the H-bomb, which was drawn up on purpose.\n \n I know of many Christian priests who throughout history have been immoral. How do I judge them? By Christian standards - it is a standard above the subjective man. Atheism can't do the same.\n \n \n I am speculating again, that it was an atheist not believing in the intrinsic worth of human life that invented it.\n\n \n \nspeculation duly noted. Feel free to show that atheists generally actually hold this belief (that humans are worthless? your personal speculations do not count).\n\n \n I've been arguing that atheism doesn't have a 'general' morality. But by this very nature, that it embraces all sorts of morals, it is a weak rule to measure things by.\n \n \nAs abiogenesis does not involve God, he's already not included.\n The same isn't so clear-cut for the Big Bang with some theistic people believing that He started it. However, there are scientific explanations to replace God here too.\n\n \n \nI said exclusive atheistic belief. Gravity does not try to exclude any god, but you don?t have a problem with the theory of gravity because it doesn?t contradict your particular opinion of what you think god is. Atheists and religious folk alike believe in gravity? in addition the religious folk (obviously) believe in God? so the theory of gravity is obviously not some ploy to explain away God. Atheists and religious folk alike believe in evolution? in addition the religious folk (obviously) believe in God? so the theory of evolution is (hopefully) obviously not some ploy to explain away God. \n You just seem to have a problem with it because it contradicts your particular idea of what God is. \n\n \n I don't think gravity is a fair example. There is, as far as I know, nothing written in the Bible that says that when an apple falls, it is due to God pulling it to the ground. There is no problem for me for gravity because it is not assigning to nature what is God's.\n \n Although we would say that gravity is there because of God. Even if you come up with a scientific reason for why gravity exists, this still does not run counter as there's nothing that I'm aware of that says that God did or didn't use these forces to put gravity there.\n \n Same with theories on electrical science. Not mentioned in the Bible - therefore any scientific one you come up with is not necessarily counter-God.\n \n Abiogenesis runs directly counter to Genesis.\n Evolution does too.\n \n They are directly going against what is assigned to God.\n \n Some Christians have been cajoled into believing that God has been removed to a mere spectator -this too is counter to the Bible's description of God's glory; it is a subjective interpretation of the Bible!\n \n As I believe that the only rational moral system is a non-Atheistic/objective one, then a system that counters this, by trying to undermine objectivity and create a non-special (naturalistic) and therefore relativistic system is wrong; philosophically speaking.",

   "like Montalban said in the first place, evolution doesn't disprove the existence of God. but that's because the existence of God, by definition, CANNOT be disproved. no argument, theory or even \"evidence\" can disprove the existence of an invisible, all-powerful, all-knowing, all-able God. you can surely doubt His existence, but its absolutely impossible to disprove it.\n \n however, evolution does go directly contrary to the concept of creation, as told by the Bible. that is only debatable item. \n \n personally, I have mixed feelings about both\n \n the problem with creation is the absence of supporting/presence of contrary evidence, such as the age of some natural structures, and the fact that a lot of biblical events left no signs for the present observation. that hardly disproves whether the events took place, but it surely doesnt prove it.\n \n the problem with evolution is the results, ie, the fact that man exists. Ironically enough, its very difficult for me to fathom the immense gap of complexity between humans and every other living thing. under normal conditions of evolution, I would suspect that there were a hella lot more \"intelligent\" beings other than humans alone, either that or humans would exist as we are at all, just another species of relatively moderate natural existence. what type of environmental conditions/series of prehistoric events would necesitate the formation of a species with ability to appreciate art, explore beyond our realm of needs, and seek pleasure over continuation? and if so, why arent other species at least 10% there?\n \n I think creation/evolution debates are pointless though. neither view really helps you to progress. and either view can be considered simply personal belief/opinion, and nothing more",

   "I agree with you, evolution does not disprove that there is a god. Evolution is fact (so I believe after the discovery of Lucy in 1974 (the first australopithecus afarensis to be discovered) followed by the discovery of homohabilis, homoerectus, neanderthal man and the subsequant natural selection process that occured to produce the modern human there is really little to debate in relation to whether evolution is fact or not, espcial since it contionus to occur!!), nevertheless, there are numerous theories that are unanswered in the scientfic field such as the formation of the earth (lets face it the big bang theory is a little dubious), perhaps as leviathan says god could have been the catalyst for this and the myriod of answered questions (or yet to be answered questions?!) is it not possible that god and nature are interrelated when it comes to the creation of the modern human? Besides is it possible to disprove the bible since it technically hasn't been proven as fact??!!\n \n \n \n \nI probably shouldn't be provoking christian elitests, but I am curious in probing your minds and gathering information. Why does evolution disprove God? Perhaps the bible, but God? It can't. Nothing can 'disprove' God.\n \n So what if evolution is truth. Couldn't God have been the catalyst that provoked transformation from ape? Just because we suspect we came from similar primates, humans were still created, right? Does evolution necessarily disprove the Bible? Can someone explain to me where this correlation comes from?\n \n \n \n Leviathan\n",

   "Sorry this response took so long, I've been sick, and I've also had to deal with finals. \n \n \n \nMost supporters in the USA. As I said, most supporters of evolution exist in atheistic nations such as North Korea, China, Vietnam, and even in de-religious regimes of the former Soviet boc and Cuba. God isn't taught. If God's not being taught, and only evolution is, then it does seem to me to be self-evident of exclusion.\n\n \n I was responding to something that limited the scope to the US. You said:\n \n And in this light, I don't believe that you've demonstrated that evolution is not a conspiracy to explain away God in the US. You've demonstrated that a large number of people in the US believe in both evolution and God.\nemphasis mine.\n \n You said I hadn't even made a case in the US. I thought it was clear that since the quote I was responding to had a limited scope, my question to you was also limited. I guess I was mistaken, so I ask again.... You don't believe I've demonstrated that evolution is NOT a conspiracy to explain away god in the US. How else can the US specific study I cited be interpreted?\n \n \nOne that springs to minds is a person's belief system. If you believe murder is okay, then you'll probably murder. If you are an atheist you MIGHT believe that man has worth - but this is not intrinsic to being an atheist.\n\n \n Atheism itself teaches no moral values. Just like the opinion that red sports cars a great. Being an atheist does not imply that the person believes man has any inherent worth, but at the same time it does not imply man has no worth. \n \n What are the moral differences between liking red sports cars and being an atheist. One conflicts with your particular religion... however you've already agreed that religions do not have a monopoly on morals. \n \n \n I for one don't believe that religions have a monopoly on morals. Atheists have morals. However, these are based on their own beliefs, which as I pointed out, can quite happily accommodate being a mass-murderer, and still be an atheist. There is to me something intrinsically wrong then with a belief system that so happily accommodates such things.\n\n \n The condition of being a man, and the opinion that red sports cars rock limit morals just as much as atheism. Why not be consistent and denounce these two positions in addition to atheism?\n \n \n When you feel mad that an injustice is happening, either\n a) it's being done by a Christian (or other religious person) - in which case you can point to what the Christian (or other religion) believes in and judge them according to if they're going against their own belief system\n or\n b) it's an atheist, in which case you can only hope to prevail upon them that your subjective opinion is more rational than their subjective opinion - and even then - what right have you to believe that your subjective opinion is better than there's? \n\n \n This seems to contradict your statement that religions do not have a monopoly on morals. We all live in societies, and one of the conditions to living in a society is subjecting yourself to society's judgment. When you feel that an injustice is happening you only have to look at the current laws of your society to decide if they can lawfully be punished. \n \n \nI don't disagree. That's not what I'm arguing. I'm not arguing about the essence of what it is to be a man, I'm arguing against atheism.\n\n \n Please clarify as to how being a man should not be considered wrong since it has just as much of an open door with regards to morals as atheism. Please clarify as to how liking red sports cars should not be considered wrong since it has jus asmuch of an open door with regards to morals as atheism. \n \n \nAnd against evolution -because it excludes God and without God you get subjective morals. \n\n \n It seems that this quote can be restated as \"I don't like this idea, so it's not true\". Please explain how your quote can NOT actually be restated like that, or promise to drop this line of reasoning. \n \n \nAgain, how do you judge 'a man'. You judge them by their actions and the beliefs that lead to these actions. Being a man is not a crime. I am looking at belief systems and actions.\n\n \n atheism is not a moral belief system, so why should it be judged as such?\n \n \nyou could of course base your opinion on your own atheistic morals but who's to say your interpretation as an atheist is any less or better than there's because as I said, atheism quite comfortably embraces all sorts of moral groupings. \n\n \n or you could base your judgment on the rules and laws of the society, or international community. \n \n \nIt is actually a bad example. I should have gone straight for the H-bomb, which was drawn up on purpose.\n \n I know of many Christian priests who throughout history have been immoral. How do I judge them? By Christian standards - it is a standard above the subjective man. Atheism can't do the same. \n\n \n Judging red sports car likers will leave you with a similar lack of judgment ability. But we all do answer to the rules and laws of our society. Actually the rules and laws of our society are much more effective than rules and laws of religion. I'm sure people in general are more concerned with the consequences of breaking a law than with the consequences of breaking a particular religious law. \n \n \n \nI've been arguing that atheism doesn't have a 'general' morality. But by this very nature, that it embraces all sorts of morals, it is a weak rule to measure things by.\n\n \n Why are you trying to measure morals with something that isn't meant to measure morals?",

The fact that people have accepted evolution is itself bad enough - because evolution de-values and excludes God.\n \n The fact that more an more Christians are taking on the general and absolute ideas of religious tolerance, tolerance of homosexuality, abortion etc - accepting ideals that are at odds with Christianity is also evidence.\n \n I accept God is a truth.\n \n \n One that springs to minds is a person's belief system.

We agree on that. That's why I think it is a worse system because you can believe in just about any moral attitude, and still be an atheist.\n \n That it accepts evils is itself a sign of it's anti-Christian (morals) nature\n \n \n I for one don't believe that religions have a monopoly on morals. Atheists have morals. However, these are based on their own beliefs, which as I pointed out, can quite happily accommodate being a mass-murderer, and still be an atheist.

(unless as detailed further below)\n \n A problem for atheists with understanding what morals are!\n \n \nWhen you feel mad that an injustice is happening, either\n a) it's being done by a Christian (or other religious person) - in which case you can point to what the Christian (or other religion) believes in and judge them according to if they're going against their own belief system\n or\n b) it's an atheist, in which case you can only hope to prevail upon them that your subjective opinion is more rational than their subjective opinion - and even then - what right have you to believe that your subjective opinion is better than there's? \n\n \nThis seems to contradict your statement that religions do not have a monopoly on morals.

When you feel that an injustice is happening you only have to look at the current laws of your society to decide if they can lawfully be punished. \n\n Not at all. I'm saying that atheistic morals are wholly subjective - I though I stated that earlier. That's why they're not a good system.\n Being in a position to decided for or against a law will either be subjective - to the atheist, or objective - to the Christian (if in fact it's a moral issue - and not one re: red sports cars :) ) the Christian has a set of rules and guidelines to judge the laws.\n \nI don't disagree. That's not what I'm arguing.

Please clarify as to how liking red sports cars should not be considered wrong since it has jus asmuch of an open door with regards to morals as atheism. \n\n \n Being a man is not a moral issue.\n \n Owning a car is not a moral issue unto itself. It might be if you had stolen the money - but then that's only because the use of the money - from ill-gotten gains makes it a moral issue.\n \n \n \n And against evolution -because it excludes God and without God you get subjective morals. \n\n \n It seems that this quote can be restated as \"I don't like this idea, so it's not true\". Please explain how your quote can NOT actually be restated like that, or promise to drop this line of reasoning. \n\n Actually I've accused atheists of the same.\n If you don't have god, then you decide what to believe in as being right - ie. subjective.\n I am a believer in the truth that God exists. Evolution is against this truth, so I am against evolution. Evolution is used by atheists to undermine the position of God - once you start doing that then we get into the world where people make things up for themselves and condemn others for judging them - they say 'who are you to judge?' acknowledging that it is just one person judging another!\n \n \n Again, how do you judge 'a man'. You judge them by their actions and the beliefs that lead to these actions. Being a man is not a crime. I am looking at belief systems and actions. \n\n \natheism is not a moral belief system, so why should it be judged as such? \n\n \n This is I guess, true. I think I'm not making myself clear - I'm against it because it allows for evil morals and good morals, and any morals all to sit snugly within it. It has to be a bad system that allows such conflict and confusion, and calls it all 'valid'.\n \n \n you could of course base your opinion on your own atheistic morals but who's to say your interpretation as an atheist is any less or better than there's because as I said, atheism quite comfortably embraces all sorts of moral groupings. \n \n \n \nor you could base your judgment on the rules and laws of the society, or international community. \n\n So you believe in fads and popular opinion?\n How do you decide that these are 'true' and 'just'. What do you measure them against. You judge by your own set of values. Even when a particular society tells me that slavery is okay, Christianity says it isn't\n Thus in Brit, and US history atheists believe slavery was okay and objected to the government interfering. Christians such as Wilberforce and Garrison (in their respective nations) used Christianity as a model to appeal to a higher sense of justice.\n \nIt is actually a bad example. I should have gone straight for the H-bomb, which was drawn up on purpose.\n \n I know of many Christian priests who throughout history have been immoral. How do I judge them? By Christian standards - it is a standard above the subjective man. Atheism can't do the same. \n \n \n \nJudging red sports car likers will leave you with a similar lack of judgment ability.

I'm sure people in general are more concerned with the consequences of breaking a law than with the consequences of breaking a particular religious law. \n\n \n I think if you build a H-bomb you are making a moral decision, because you are creating a thing designed to do something immoral; to kill. The H-bomb is not moral. The red sports car is not moral, liking a red sports car might be if you had a fetish for it. Owning a car, making a car doesn't mean it's a moral issue - unless you designed it solely to kill pedestrians.\n \n \n I've been arguing that atheism doesn't have a 'general' morality. But by this very nature, that it embraces all sorts of morals, it is a weak rule to measure things by. \n\n \n Why are you trying to measure morals with something that isn't meant to measure morals? \n\n I am measuring it, because it is accepting of evils. Any belief system that allows for such things to sit comfortably with it, must be seriously flawed. It's like a club.\n The Christian Club says \"You can be a member if you believe 'x', 'y' and 'z' and only these things\"\n The Atheist Club says \"You can be a member, as long as you don't believe in God... we'll accept you if you believe wife-beating is okay, or not, or if slavery is okay, or not. Everyone just has to disbelieve in God\"",

   "*there is no god*\n *red sports cars are great*\n *there is a God*\n \n Holding the belief that XXXXXXX is an inherently amoral stance. The stance that XXXXXX does not imply any moral values; in addition, the stance that XXXXXX also \"accepts\" any and all moral stances, simply because the stance is not meant to make moral decisions. \n \n Read through the above paragraph and insert the three stances outlined in asterisks into where the XXXXX's are. Can you tell which of the stances can fit into the above paragraph, and which stances can not?\n \n Is there any reason red sports cars and atheism can not both go into the paragraph?\n \n You went on to say that the stance of liking red sports cars can be immoral if a person steals sports cars, or someone runs down pedestrians with their car... but 1) the original stance of liking red sports cars is not meant to judge the actions, and 2) when some other moral code is applied to the actions (be it social law or religious doctrine) moral judgments can be formed. This is exactly the same with atheism. An atheists' behavior is never judged by atheistic moral standards (because there are none). Even after actions are committed they are not judged by atheistic standards. \n \n Until you can describe the major difference between atheism and liking red sports cars, and why you are not in support of both, or against both you will not have made a convincing case against atheism. \n \n \n Actually I've accused atheists of the same.\n\n \n but that doesn't answer my question. It's a tu quoque fallacy. \n \n So you accept that not liking an ideas has no bearing on its validity. \n \n \n And against evolution -because it excludes God and without God you get subjective morals.\n\n \n I'm inferring that you're against subjective morals. What does your dislike for subjective morals have to do with the probability of the accuracy of evolution or atheism?\n \n \nIt has to be a bad system that allows such conflict and confusion, and calls it all 'valid'.\n\n \n \"valid\" in that there is no inherent conflict between atheism and killing babies... but is there an inherent conflict between killing babies and liking red sports cars?\n \n \n So you believe in fads and popular opinion?\n How do you decide that these are 'true' and 'just'. What do you measure them against. You judge by your own set of values. Even when a particular society tells me that slavery is okay, Christianity says it isn't\n Thus in Brit, and US history atheists believe slavery was okay and objected to the government interfering. Christians such as Wilberforce and Garrison (in their respective nations) used Christianity as a model to appeal to a higher sense of justice.\n\n \n while I think you're mistaken about Christians never using the bible to justify their (now considered) immoral actions, this topic is about the moral implications of atheism. I say there are no implications whatsoever... good or bad. \n \n \nThe red sports car is not moral, liking a red sports car might be if you had a fetish for it. Owning a car, making a car doesn't mean it's a moral issue - unless you designed it solely to kill pedestrians.\n\n \n so the results of a particular stance can be morally judged... but not by the stance itself? how can you not draw the connection to the completely amoral stance of atheism?\n \n \n The Christian Club says \"You can be a member if you believe 'x', 'y' and 'z' and only these things\"\n The Atheist Club says \"You can be a member, as long as you don't believe in God... we'll accept you if you believe wife-beating is okay, or not, or if slavery is okay, or not. Everyone just has to disbelieve in God\"\n\n \n and the Auto Club says \"you can be a member as long as you like sports cars. If you like running over little cats we'll accept you, but if that's not your thing come on in\"... some of the particular members maybe disagree with the cats part... but does that have any influence on the like for red sports cars?",

You've actually gone and researched something about Orthodoxy's Holy Tradition. I'd be proud of you, except instead of looking at an Orthodox site, you've gone to a sceptic's site (is this wanting someone else to do your thinking for you?)\n \n What's you site say?\n \"In general the church fathers' sense of history is not the same as modern critical historians. They would sometimes quote apocryphal works as though they were historical. One example is from Hippolytus' (c170-c236) Commentary on Daniel:\"\n \n Okay, but who was Hippolytus?\n \n Yes he was a Church Father.\n \n Did he write what this site claims?\n http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0502.htm\n Shows all extant commentary by Hippolytus. The quote taken from Iamthetruth's site is from a passage that does not exist, according to this site.\n \n I even checked http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0503.htm\n \n I did a search for \"Hippolytus\" and \"when Paul was condemned to the beast\" on ixquick.com, a metasearch engine, and the only place this comes up with an exact match is Iamthetruth's site. Who is Streeter; the gentleman who comes up with this claim? He writes in 1929. (Burnett Hillman Streeter, The Primitive Church, Studied with Special Reference to the Origins of the Christian Ministry. London: Macmillan, 1929. pp. xiv + 323.)\n \n Your case is flimsy.\n \n If you can actually find a site that quotes the whole text, that would be cool. I'd like to read it myself, I like reading early church writers - that's one of the reasons I converted to Orthodoxy.\n \n \nThis is the whole reason the Orthodox Church does not recommend personal interpretations!\n\n \n \n \nBwhahahahahahahaha!\n Read the above link. It seems that personal interpretations and embellisment (sic) is the norm! \n I'll be thinking of you Monty, standing there in your church in Wentworthville, sucking the lies in and believing every word of it as if it was truth.\n\n \n Anyway, you've gone around this the wrong way.\n \n You should read something on Orthodoxy by the Orthodox.\n \n Although your case is not proven, it would fall down anyway. You almost hit upon the idea I've been trying to express - Personal interpretation is not the norm. Even Church Fathers made mistakes. Saint Augustine, one of the biggest influences in western Christianity retracted some of his earlier works. That is the problem with 'personal interpretation's. We recognise this. Even whole councils have been lead into error - I've made this know several times already. Look for where I've commented on the iconoclasm controversy.\n \n We Orthodox have a system of checks and balances, when one writer comes out and says something; we don't immediately believe it - unlike you - because you've just accepted what this site says, regardless.\n \n The funny thing is you've attempted to undermine what Orthodoxy says about tradition based on what one writer says! Even if you have brought for the Commentary of Daniel it would be one writer. You should also note that Hippolytus was condemned for a while by the regular church for claiming to be Pope. Why not raise this? Just because he claimed to be Pope - does that mean he was? We set no one man above the Church.\n \n Even after\n a) ignoring the fact your case is based on no facts\n b) your case is based on the wrong interpretation of how Holy Tradition is viewed by us\n you claim that this case is normative.\n \n You've failed to show that too!\n \n \n PS\n My church is not in Wentworthville.

Or maybe the Noachian flood story is simply a myth with no basis in reality. Hmmm.\n\n \n \n \"Mitochondrial DNA and Human Evolution\", extracted from  \"The search for Eve\", by Michael H Brown [Nature: January 1, 1987]\n \"Mitochondrial DNAs from 147 people, drawn from five geographic populations, have been analyzed by restriction mapping. All these mitochondrial DNAs  stem from one woman who is postulated to have lived about 200,000 years ago...\"This article explains that the authors - Rebecca L Cann, Mark Stoneking and Allan C Wilson - in analyzing DNA from the energy producing compartments of the human cell known as the mitochondria, have discovered that this genetic material, inherited through the ages, provides \"new perspectives on how, where, and when the human gene pool arose and grew.\"\n http://www.ramsdale.org/adam.htm\n \n Yes, some refer to 'her' as \"Mitochondrial Eve\". Some do not... the title of the book above says \"EVE\" The very fact they use the name 'Eve' is highly suggestive of a single person. That's why they use it. I could keep referring to a \"Biblical Eve\" rather than just \"Eve\" and you have some that refer to \"Mitochondrial Eve\" or \"Eve\" to distinguish that your one woman was not 'created'.\n \n We do dispute 'human' form. I believe humans are humans, not apes or 'ape-like'. However that aside, the suggestion was made by another poster that there was not 'enough' genetic diversity in the few creatures on the ark. I suggested that all the diversity needed for all the human forms could come from one woman with whom science now also suggest is a possibility the only really bit difference between what I believe and what you believe centres around the time scale.\n \n You are quick to anger.\n \n \n As to my assertion about a particular tribe in Africa:\n see the documents under Research Supporting the Eve/Out of Africa Hypothesis\n http://www.nzedge.com/heroes/wilson-reading.html#C\n \n As to the bushmen; I concede that my statement was ill-worded.\n See...\n Q) Why are the people of southern Africa who are often called Bushmen important to the genetic history of humanity?\n A) After modern humans appeared in eastern Africa, they expanded within Africa before spreading into the rest of the world. By about 100,000 years ago, modern humans were living near the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa. The Bushmen may well be the descendants of this first population of modern humans to spread out of eastern Africa. For example, their mitochondrial DNA contains mutations that date back almost to the time of mitochondrial Eve.  If any group has a claim to being most closely related to our early modern ancestors, it is the Bushmen. Yet these people are as biologically modern as any other group of humans, with a sophisticated language and complex social structure.\n http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/booksellers/press_release/olson/\n \n \n As to my post in general...\n Well, not 'absolute' rubbish, anyway. :)",

You are mixing up the opinion with the belief system that results in that opinion.\n \n \nWhy you seem to be raising it is still beyond my reasoning.\n\n \n \nbecause it's just as accommodating as atheism, but you don't have a problem with it.\n\n \n Yes, but it is a totally different thing you are comparing. I like pizza, my belief system says that opinion is amoral. The belief system accommodates a number of options with regards to likes; I can like pizza, cars, etc. The options are not the belief system.\n \n Atheism however has not restrictions on any moral opinions. Whereas Christianity might say that my liking porn is immoral, Atheism does not. Liking porn, red sports cars etc is only moral/amoral/immoral depending upon your belief system.

   "Liking red cars is not a belief system. It is not an over-arching system such as religious belief. It is a decision, such as liking a pizza, etc that is amoral, depending upon your belief system. It is not the belief system.\n\n \n atheism is also amoral, and is not any kind of religious belief system. So why are you treating it as such? Atheism is closer to liking red sports cars than it is to a religious system. \n \n \nNot at all. Atheism is a belief system that allows for differing opinions on what is moral. You are mixing up the opinion with the belief system that results in that opinion.\n\n \n it (atheism) is a belief system in the loosest sense of the term, and it is in no way a religious system. Atheism as you say \"allows\" for various morals, but atheism does not encourage any morals over any others. \n \n \nAtheism however has not restrictions on any moral opinions.\n\n \n and you're back to the implication that religion somehow has a monopoly on morals. it seems the only problem you have with atheism is that it closes a door on religion. And this in itself wouldn't be a bad thing as long as a person didn't think the only source of good morals was from religion. \n \n [/quote=montalban]Whereas Christianity might say that my liking porn is immoral, Atheism does not. Liking porn, red sports cars etc is only moral/amoral/immoral depending upon your belief system. Atheism is a belief system... a belief in no God.[/quote]\n \n while Christianity and other religions may make suggestions as to what to think about porn and red sports cars, and atheism, and whatever, atheism does not make any limits on any of the above EXCEPT for what to think about god, and that is only because the very definition of atheism deals with god. \n \n \nIf [liking red sports cars] were a belief system, you'd have a point. It isn't; therefore you've no point - that I can see. \n\n \n so show me how atheism is just as much a belief system as Christianity. Also show me how atheism is more of a belief system than liking red cars. \n \n I'll take the counter argument:\n Atheism is limited to one very specific idea. The belief that there is no god. That idea is contained in the meaning of the word. As you have admitted to, atheism does not support or reject any other opinions or mindsets. There is no hidden agenda, or wider meaning of atheism. Liking red sports cars also contains only one very specific idea. There are no wider meanings. Liking red sports cars makes no judgments about any other opinions or ideas. Christianity has many facets and applies to many aspects of an individuals life. There is no one specific lesson or teaching. Christianity makes judgments about many other opinions and ideals. \n \n Also notice the difference between a specific religion, and theism (opposite of atheism). Theism is much more limited in it's meaning, and no wider implications when compared to a specific religion. \n \n Please show how atheism (and theism) is more of a belief system than liking red cars. Also show how atheism is as much of a belief system as Christianity. \n \n \nThat is why Atheism is a very poor option for a belief system.\n\n \n well duh. That's like saying a flashlight is a very poor option for opening cans. \n \n You're trying to apply something to a use that it is not meant to be applied to.",

   "Refer to post 94, the belief system model.\n \n It is true, not all Atheists believe that atheism is a belief system, because there is no agreement on anything amongst atheists, except in non-belief of God. Atheism accepts both stances. :)\n \n Is it a 'system' of beliefs?\n \n Buddhism is an atheistic religion. It is systematic.\n \"Although Buddhism is perhaps the best known atheistic religion, there are others, such as Jainism and some mystical forms of Hinduism. Chun Fang Yu has said of Chinese religions: \n Unlike most other religions, Chinese religion does not have a creator God. There is no God transcendent and separate from the world and there is no heaven outside of the universe to which human beings would want to go for refuge.\"\n http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/religion/blrel_bel_theism.htm\n \n This is a system of beliefs, tied to a particular notion of Buddhism being true. It is not tied to atheism in the sense that all atheists by definition are Buddhists, but this is because Atheism itself is flexible enough a belief system to allow for all beliefs, providing one does not believe in God.\n \n It is recognised as a belief system...One religious site says \"Atheism is a belief system that ardently denies the existence of God.\"*\n http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/atheism.htm\n \n An atheist site gives you a run-down of atheist beliefs\n Look at - Questions about Atheism and Atheists: Atheist Beliefs\n http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/ath/blathq_belief.htm\n \n \"There is absolutely no similarity between the Atheist philosophical stance in life and that of the religious. Atheists accept only facts, whereas the religious et al find no need for them.\"\n http://www.atheistfoundation.org.au/belief.htm\n This is still saying that it is a belief system, based on rationality, and facts. Or though this site might argue that it's a 'rationality system' rather than a 'belief system'.\n \n As I showed with my model, the first and greater choice is for or against God. After that, Atheists still need other beliefs...\n \"Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience. Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt.\"\n http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/intro.html\n \n It is a belief in what is 'rational' as opposed to irrational believers in the supernatural.\n \"That which we do not know is our ignorance and seen in that light, a ?belief? in the supernatural etc. is giving ignorance far greater credibility than reasoned thinking should permit.\"\n http://www.atheistfoundation.org.au/belief.htm\n \n Atheism is still the over-arching factor. And regardless of what the atheist ends up adopting, it's all good for atheism accepts them all excepting a belief in God. Thus with Buddhism being an example of a system, once one accepts Atheism then all other systems other than a belief in God are acceptable. However, Atheism remains hierarchically above all these other opinions.\n \n Further References...\n Atheism as a belief system... as discussed by an atheist.\n http://www.geocities.com/estle46224/faith.html\n \n \n *http://atheismawareness.home.att.net/questions/atheist.htm disagrees with the notion that atheism is a belief system.",
