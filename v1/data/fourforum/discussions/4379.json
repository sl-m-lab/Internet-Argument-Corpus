   "Let's look at two brief stories of \"How We Got Here.\" Let's forget where they come from, and judge them simply on which appeals to us more. (Yes there will be some bias in the telling - oh well).\n \n Story 1:\n The universe began billions upon billions of years ago, with a fantastic Bang, a virtual explosion of light and energy. The material from that expansion cooled and clumped together, forming massive systems, huge spinning discs of matter - and inside those discs, huge atomic furnaces came to life, creating new kinds of elements inside them and dispersing them with massive explosions. Some of those elements were impregnated into smaller, more solid objects travelling around some of the furnaces. As many of the elements interacted with each other, forming more complex substances, some of them started to replicate themselves, and through the occasional mutation new, more complex organisms arose. Enough mutations later at least one of those planets was able to support life intelligent enough to ponder about and learn where they came from.\n \n Story 2:\n A magical being spoke the universe into being on a whim. It took about 6 days, after which the being was pooped so it rested. In all the vastness of its creation, it chose to put life on only one tiny, insignificant speck of a place, and it did so by digging up some dirt and breathing life into it. \n \n \n One of the things I occasionally hear is that science takes the wonder out of the world. Myself, I find the first story much more fantastic and wonderous than the second. \n \n Many creationists take offense at the notion of mankind coming from monkees, but they don't understand that our true origins go back much much further. I would ask them, where would you rather come from: The Stuff of Stars, or Mud?",

   "whats the difference? are monkeys made of the stuff of stars? arent stars made of the same stuff mud is made of?\n\n \n You are correct, in that everything in our scientific worldview originated in the heart of stars - monkeys, men, toothpicks, refigerators.... But in the Biblical worldview, this did not happen. There was the sun, there was the earth, and there was dirt. The latter two did not come from the former, but from the word of god. (Granted, if you're a day-age Creationist, this isn't strictly true, but I'm talking about literal interpretation here). Man came from dirt which came from god. I'll take a fiery atomic furnace over that - makes me feel like a superhero: \"Born in the Heart of a Star: FishPower!!\"",
