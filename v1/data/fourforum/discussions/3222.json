   "In dealing with several posters on the issue of the 'Nylon Bug' it seems that there exists some confusion over the difference between 'Natural selection' and 'Artificial Selection', not least caused by confusion amongst web-resources.\n Darwin and other earlier theorists seemed able to differentiate between natural and artificial selection\n Darwin says that even when man did it by accident, it was artificial...\n \"Hence it must be assumed, not only that half-civilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and further, that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown.

   "In conjunction, and continuing from the above post I present this.\n \n It seems that not only do evolutionists put forward examples of artificial selection as evidence of natural selection, they also present purpose as randomness.\n \n A good example is the Typing Monkeys scearnio\n \"Attempts have been made to support evolution by appealing to mathematics to justify long ages. For example, Nobel prize winner, George Wald, wrote, \"Time is the hero of the plot. Given enough time anything can happen - the impossible becomes probable, the improbable becomes certain.\" (1)\n Thomas Huxley (\"Darwin's Bulldog\") used this technique in Oxford, in 1860, while debating Samuel Wilberforce. He stated that if monkeys randomly strummed typewriter keys for a long enough time, then sooner or later Psalm 23 would be printed out. Huxley used this argument to demonstrate that life could have originated on Earth by chance. (2)\n \n Julian Huxley (1887-1975) repeated this analogy to 'prove' that long periods of time could allow impossible evolution to occur. In his analogy, given enough time, monkeys randomly typing on typewriters could eventually type out the complete works of Shakespeare. (3)\n \n Stephen Hawking used the monkey story in 1988. He proposed that if there was a horde of typing monkeys, then \"very occasionally by pure chance they will type out one of Shakespeare's sonnets.\" (4)\n \n When all these outlandish statements were made \"... no evolutionary scientist or mathematician who knew better raised a single objection.\" (5) So as a result, these statements have convinced many people that 5 billion years is enough time for life to evolve on Earth.\"\n http://www.unmaskingevolution.com/20-typing.htm\n \n Dawkins continues this hypothesis in his novel \"The Blind Watchmaker\"\n Dawkins provides an easy-to-understand computer simulation of the principle of selection from random mutations using the example of a \"monkey typist.\" The monkey's first efforts on the typewriter produce the following random string of characters:\n WDLMNLT DTJBKWIRZREZLMQCO P\n \n Dawkins now \"breeds\" from this incomprehensible starting point a litter of \"progeny\" in each one of which a letter is randomly changed to any other letter (with a space counting as a letter). Of all the offspring, only one is kept for continued breeding; the one whose letter sequence matches more closely, however, slightly, the Shakespearean phrase:\n \n METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL\n \n After forty-one generations of \"breeding,\" the random initial phrase \"evolves\" into the target phrase: \"METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL.\"\n Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker, 47-8.\n quoted at\n http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2000/PSCF9-00Larson.html\n and\n \"A potential source of confusion is the idea of evolution having a \"target;'' we have normally combined this activity with others, such as Selection in Action, to address this. Cumulative SelectionOne of the most frequent arguments one hears against the theory of evolution is that complex forms and behaviors simply couldn't have evolved by ``random chance'' alone. The point we must often get across to students is that evolution does not, in fact, work this way; change is cumulative. Richard Dawkins, in his book The Blind Watchmaker, dispels the myth of random chance by using the very metaphor that opponents of evolution often turn to: the monkey at the typewriter. This program models his suggestion that, were a monkey allowed to type random letters, he would produce a work of Shakespeare very quickly if letters he happened to type in the right places were preserved with each attempt. With this program, students type in a phrase of their choosing and observe how long a random phrase takes to ``evolve'' into their target phrase. Below are some sample investigations...\"\n http://www.geocities.com/jscarrie/sf0/bill.html\n \n However, the problem is that these proposals rest on the anti-evolutionary idea of 'purpose'.\n \"When I observe that Richard Dawkins was unable to write a computer program that simulated his linguistic thought experiment, I did not mean that the task at hand was difficult. It is impossible. Mr Wadkins commends the discussion in Keen and Spain's Computer Simulation in Biology as a counterexample; it is no such thing. What Keen and Spain have done is (to) transcribe Dawkins's blunder into the computer language BASIC. Here are the steps that they undertake. A target sentence is selected \"BASIC BIOLOGICAL MODELLING IS FUN\". The computer is given a randomly derived set of letters. The letters are scrambled. At each iteration, the computer (or the programmer) compares the randomly derived sequence with the target phrase. If the arrays - sequences on the one hand, target phrase on the other - do not match, the experiment continues; if they do, it stops.\n There is nothing in this that is not also in Dawkins, the fog spreading from one book to the next. The experiment that Keen and Spain conduct is successful inasmuch as the computer reaches the target; but unsuccessful as a defense of Darwinian evolution. In looking to its target and comparing distances, the computer is appealing to information a biological system could not possess.\n The point seems to be less straightforward than I imagined, so let me spell out the mistake. Starting from a random string, suppose the computer generates the sequence BNDIT DISNE SOT SODISWN TOSWXMSPW SSO. Comparing the sequence with its target, it proposes to conserve the initial \"B\". But why? The string is gibberish. Plainly, the conservation of vagrant successes has been undertaken with the computer's eye fixed firmly on its future target, intermediates selected not for what they are (gibberish, after all), but for what they will be (an English sentence). This is in violation of the rule against deferred success. Without the rule, there is nothing remotely like Darwinian evolution. What the computer has in fact done is to match randomly selected items to a template, thus inevitably reintroducing the element of deliberate design banished from the Darwinian model.\"\n David Berlinski; \"Letters: David Berlinski and Critics\" in Dembski, W. A. (ed) \"Uncommon Dissent: Intellectuals who Find Darwinism Unconvincing\", p304\n \n Another of his analogies is equally illuminating in debunking Dawkins (et al)\n \"I imagine this story being told to me by Jorge Luis Borges one evening in a Buenos Aires cafe.\n His voice dry and infinitely ironic, the ageing, nearly blind literary master observes that \"the Ulysses,\" mistakenly attributed to the Irishman James Joyce, is in fact derived from \"the Quixote\".\n I raise my eyebrows.\n Borges pauses to sip discreetly at the bitter coffee our waiter has placed in front of him, guiding his hands to the saucer.\n \"The details of the remarkable series off events in question may be found at the University of Leiden,\" he says. \"They were conveyed to me by the Freemason Alejandro Ferri in Montevideo.\"\n Borges wipes his thin lips with a linen handkerchief that he has withdrawn from his breast pocket.\n \"As you know\", he continues, \"the original handwritten text of the Quixote was given to an order of French Cistercians in the autumn of 1576.\"\n I hold up my hand to signify to our waiter that no further services is needed.\n \"Curiously enough, for none of the brothers could read Spanish, the Order was charged by the Papal Nuncio, Hoyo dos Monterrey (a man of great refinement and implacable will), with the responsibility for copying he Quixote, the printing press having then gained no currency in the wilderness of what is now the department of Auvergne. Unable to speak or read Spanish, a language they not unreasonably detested, the brothers copied the Quixote over and over again, re-creating the text but, of course, compromising it as well, and so inadvertently discovering the true nature of authorship. Thus they created Fernando Lor's Los Hombres d'Estado in 1585 by means of a singular series of copying errors, and then in 1654 Juan Luis Samorza's remarkable epistolary novel Por Favor by the same means; and then in 1685, the errors having accumulated sufficiently to change Spanish into French, Moliere's Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme; their copying continuous and indefatigable, the work handed down from generation to generation as a sacred but secret trust, so that in time the brothers of the monastery, known only to members of the Bourbon house, and rumor has it, the Englishman and psychic Conan Doyle, copied into creation Stendhal's The Red and the Black and Flaubert's Madame Bovary; and then as a result of a particularly significant series of errors, in which French changed into Russian, Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Illych and Anna Karenina. Late in the last decade of the 19th century there suddenly emerged, in English, Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, and then the brothers, their numbers reduced by an infections disease of mysterious origin, finally copied the Ulysses into creation in 1902, the manuscript lying neglected for almost thirteen years and then mysteriously making its way to Paris in 1915, just months before the British attack on the Somme, a circumstance whose significance remains to be determined.\"\n I sit there, amazed at what Borges has recounted. \"Is it your understanding, then,\" I ask, \"that every novel in the West was created in this way?\"\n \"Of course,\" replies Borges imperturbably. Then he adds: \"Although every novel is derived directly from another novel, there is really only one novel, the Quixote.\"\n David Berlinski; \"The Deniable Darwin\" in Dembski, W. A.

I honestly don't know how someone could read the book and interept as an attempt of a solid proof that there is no such thing as \"purpose\" and life has no guidance from the supernatural.\n\n (emphasis mine - Montalban)\n \n You have done it! The chief concern here, for advocates of materialistic evolution for 'natural selection' is the use of the word 'guided'. A huge array of posters on these threads believe that natural selection 'just happened' through mechanistic means - without the 'need' for guidance. One poster said that natural selection has made God's presence microscopic, another doesn't believe in God at all; that evolution happened through its own means. And yet they and people more eminent such as Dawkins continually use the language of intelligent design in order to argue for unguided mechanistic processes! (It is a nonsense akin to them arguing for 'natural selection' by using 'artificial selection' models)\n \n That is what is so amusing about Dawkins' model. To randomly gain the correct sentence, complete without errors, from the starting point of a code that is a complete jumble... that is to get from WDLMNLT DTJBKWIRZREZLMQCO P to METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL (the examples he uses), Dawkins and others quickly realised the phenomenal odds against this (hence 'mount improbable). They circumvented this by use of a clever trick...\n \n He says that during the random selection of letters, if a correct letter is chosen, such as the initial \"M\" (that will form part of the METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL phrase), then we use the program to 'fix' that letter in place, and then continue with the random selection process until another or other correctly placed letters are selected. This process makes it mathematically more probable to gain the target phrase (METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL) then just attempting to get the whole phrase in one foul swoop. The whole point of Berlinski's critique is there is nothing in nature to do such selection. The computer program works because we have a 'target' to compare the jumble with. There is no 'target' in nature, nor does nature do comparison.\n \n Nature doesn't look at a mutation and go \"Okay, this is of no benefit now, but the sequence of genetic code in the middle of a larger code would be of benefit down the track, so we'll hang onto those and keep searching through random sequences through the others\". It doesn't do this, because proponents of natural selection rule out 'ends'... other than survival, and survival simply come about because organisms survive (hence the tautology of \"Survival of the Fittest\" which Darwin himself felt was a superior phrase to \"Natural Selection\"). There is nothing in nature to fix the 'correct' coding sequences (baring in mind some ultimate target), and during further mutations the 'correct' code could also be affected, thus again undermining the belief that one can move from one organism to another by a mechanistic and gradual process.\n \n Further, there is no comparison by nature. Nature doesn't say \"web feet really work well, we'll keep mutating this species until it attains them.\"\n \n They; Berkinski and others believe in evolution and believe that a 'guiding hand' or intelligence may be somewhere at work properly fixing the correct codes and thus allowing one species to evolve into other species. They believe that mechanistic evolution is just too improbable. Hence he provides an amusing analogy of an evolving series of books... which though they contain more letters in their code, are less complex things than living organisms. If you believe in a theistic evolution then fine, but I am not arguing against you on this (at this time :) ) I'm arguing against those who believe that we came about solely through materialistic means; the materialists such as Mach et al.\n \n The idea of materialism has been around for a long time, and has likewise been debunked for a long time; but still some people want to keep with it because they don't believe in God; they need to explain things through a godless process.\n Cicero said\n At this point must I not marvel that there should be anyone who can persuade himself that there are certain solid and indivisible particles of matter borne along by the force of gravity, and that the fortuitous collision of those particles produces this elaborate and beautiful world? I cannot understand why he who considers it possible for this to have occurred should not also think that, if a countless number of copies of the one-and-twenty letters of the alphabet, made of gold or what you will, were thrown on the ground, it would be possible that they should produce the Annals of Ennius, all ready made for the reader\"\n De natura deorum, II.xxxvii\n quoted\n James Barham \"Why I am Not a Darwinist\", in Dembski, W.

   "\"They believe that mechanistic evolution is just too improbable.\"\n \n Ah... do they now. You see, Berkinski et al seem to have a limited comprehension as to what causes life to change in space and time.\n \n Where they see improbability I see inevitability- life, in whatever form we care to discuss, is vying to survive against a whole battery of challenges. Some of those challenges confront it on a short term basis- the need for food, suitable environmental conditions in which to survive and so on. Others may be an issue over a longer period of time- the need to find a mate and reproduce, can it survive annual changes in local climates. Ultimately, life has to be able to adapt to the longest term changes- like a major shift in underlying climatic conditions or local topography.\n \n And so on- we can consider a whole host of changes that confronts life at various times over different timescales. What is clear from such consideration is the never ending need for life to able to adapt- the Earth is a dynamic and forever changing place (even the very ground beneath you now is transient in nature) and environments have changed dramatically over the course of this planets history. If life were still and static it would never have come to be in the first place. If it can not adapt to a new challenges quickly enough- well just think of all the examples we have of life that is extinct.\n \n So I really cannot see why Berkinski and his peers find natural evolution, or whatever you care to call it improbable- the driving forces are there to see if you are inclined to learn about them.\n \n What I really find improbable is the notion of an omnipotent supernatural enitity outside of the physical universe somehow being able to comprehend and interact with the life in ours- and even to have the desire to do so!",

In the analogy the guidance by humans represents natural selection.

If some electrons see other electrons coming at them down a wire they will also move down the wire to avoid them. If it means going through a circuit an powering a light globe to do the electrons will still flow if the circuit is complete. Now lets think about whats happening, each indivual electron hates large group of electrons coming towards it but to get out of the way it will have to get closer to other electrons (those punks). So if you increased the cross sectional area of the wire then the resistance will decrease. What about a double adaptor? All it does is let the current go through two different circuits.

   "Darwin says that even when man did it by accident, it was artificial...\n\n You seem to have trouble creating working links. Here is a corrected link to your quote. \n \n Darwin, Charles. On the Origin of Species - 6th Edition. Chapter 1 - Variation Under Domestication.\n Do a find on, \"Hence it must be assumed\" to see the quote in context.\n \n Your intent might be misinterpreted by some who have not read \"Origin\" and are unfamiliar with Darwin thoughts. To the uninformed, your claim about what Darwin said could easily be misinterpreted to mean that even accidental changes to the environment by man that cause evolutionary change in populations is \"artificial selection.\" Of course, you couldn't have meant that, since that is clearly not what Darwin was talking about. The context of the quote that you cite makes that clear. The whole context of the quote is in the chapter on Variation Under Domestication. Darwin does not discuss accidental changes to the environment in that chapter. That certainly would be more confusing than profitable in a chapter in which Darwin was attempting to explain the basics of his theory with examples from domestic animals, especially pigeons. It is abundantly clear that Darwin was referring to the selection by man of breeding stock since he remarks that in the domestication of a species man \"...intentionally or by chance picked out...\" characteristics. Of course, by use of the word \"chance\", Darwin meant characteristics that existed in the individuals of the breeding stock that were selected for other reasons, i.e., intentionally.\n \nBut this line seems blurred in the quest for evidence of 'natural' natural selection.\n\n I'm not sure what you mean. Your quotes from dictionaries certainly give no indication of any bluring. I'll give you another definition acceptable to biologists. Natural selection is the process by which organisms well adapted to their environment survive to produce offspring while those more poorly adapted may not. In this way, particular combinations of genes are propagated differentially.\n \nBoth deal with the change of organisms. 'A' suggests only that which occurs 'naturally', whilst 'B' suggests change affected by any cause; natural or artificial.\n\n B suggests no such thing. B suggests that the change is a result of adaptation to the environment.\n \nInterestingly enough one of those above also states...\n 1. artificial selection \n Definition: \n The selective breeding by humans towards a desired trait in a plant, animal, or other organism which is of value (usually economic) to the humans. The process operates on the same principles as natural selection.\n \n But man has a purposeful process. This would mean 'nature' also has purpose in it's 'selection' process.\n\n That's ridiculous. The purpose imposed by man is what makes it artificial in the first place. You have the idea expressed in the definition backwards. It isn't that natural selection operates on the same principles as artificial selection, but the reverse. The principles are that differential reproductive success will have an effect on the gene pool of the species.\n \nAgain, an emphasis on purpose is given by the following...\n\n Of course an explanation of artificial selection would talk about purpose. I'm not sure how that is meaningful to the discussion. And of course, mention of eugenics is irrelevant to natural selection.\n \nIt seems some people can't help wishing purpose on evolution. Which is why, in order to give examples of Natural Selection, a textbook will state...\n\n Strange that you seem to miss the meaning of your own quotes. Of course the phrase, \"survival of the fittest\" is a tautology. But you ignored an important part of your own quote, \"Thus, without an independent criterion for fitness, other than survival,...\" And of course, Darwin did most certainly express other criterion besides survival. Let me help clarify for you. Survival is not the sole requirement, or even the most important requirement. It should be quite clear to even the most muddled thinker that reproduction is required. In fact, reproduction is the most important requirement. Survival is necessary only long enough for an organism to reproduce, and if an organism doesn't reproduce, it is an evolutionary dead end no matter how long it survives. You see, as was mentioned in your definitions and in comments, natural selection is differential reproduction. Natural selection is not a tautology. Only the phrase, \"survival of the fittest\" reduces to a tautology.\n \nEvolution it seems can contain tautology, mutually exclusive theory, and redundant terminologies.\n\n Again, I'm not sure what you are talking about. Can you give some examples? Of course a popular phrase applied to one evolutionary mechanism may reduce to a tautology when expressed without adequate criterion. But what about mutually exclusive theory? Certainly it is possible that two theories may be mutually exclusive before some mechanism is understood enough for us to determine which is correct. There are still answers that we don't have.\n \n Anyway, please give some examples. It isn't very instructive when you just drop off with some throw-away comment given without evidence or support.\n \nIt seems that not only do evolutionists put forward examples of artificial selection as evidence of natural selection, they also present purpose as randomness.\n\n Where did you get that idea? Artificial selection was never proposed as evidence but rather as a more familiar illustration of the principles and mechanisms of evolution.\n \nA good example is the Typing Monkeys scearnio\n\n Another assertion without offering any evidence as to why you are correct. None of the quotes you give offer purpose as randomness.\n \n It is bizarre to see someone calculate the odds that something will happen after it has happened. It is even more bizarre to see that someone read all of those quotes and apparently missed the context in which they were presented. Certainly none of them were meant to present purpose as randomness. You seem to have missed to point of your own quotes.\n \n Later Montalban says:\n \nIt doesn't do this, because proponents of natural selection rule out 'ends'... other than survival, and survival simply come about because organisms survive (hence the tautology of \"Survival of the Fittest\" which Darwin himself felt was a superior phrase to \"Natural Selection\").\n\n As was pointed out in some of your own quotations, survival is not an 'end' of natural selection. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics. It is a statistical tendency. Individual organisms may work to survive, but they also work to reproduce. That's as close as it gets to \"purpose.\" And as you know, Darwin's favored term was natural selection. He never used the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. Since Darwin's time \"survival of the fittest\" has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory.",

But even these statements don't go far enough. An example can be found in [b]The Beak of the Finch[b] by Jonathan Weiner. It is the story of the research done by Peter and Rosmary Grant into the 2 species of Darwin's finches found on a single, small island in the Galapagos. Over those 20 years they learned to recognize every bird on the island by sight. They managed to capture and tag every bird on the island in those 20 years. Two of those birds were the longest lived of any of the birds on the island. They evaded capture for 5 years. They also failed to produce a single offspring that survived long enough to reproduce. Although these two birds were the \"fittest\" for survival that the Grants observed in 20 years, they were both evolutionary dead ends because none of their offspring survived to reproduce.\n \nThe problem of natural and artificial then boils down to what your definition of those words are.\n\n Or what your mis-definition of those words are.\n \nIn the case of animal breeding, this becomes quite obvious. A man picks two animals to breed, and the rest do not breed. This is artificial selection.\n\n Right. The Dictionary of Modern Biology says that artificial selection is, \"The directed selection of specific genetic traits by humans in wild or domesticated organisms including agricultural crops and livestock. It was the observation of this phenomenon that allowed Charles Darwin to originate an analogy leading to the concept of natural selection.\"\n \n So artificial selection isn't an example of natural selection and it isn't \"proof\" of either natural selection or evolution. It was an observation that formed the basis of an analogy that allowed the formation of an hypothesis. Any confusion between the two seems to be caused by a lack of careful reading for comprehension.\n \nIn the case of something like a nylon bug, humans did not determine which individuals reproduced or not, nature did. This is natural selection.\n\n Exactly. Any claims to the contrary are certainly caused by a lack of understanding of the topic. It was the environment in which these microbes lived that was the selecting factor. That the environment was altered by humans is irrelevant since they did not do so for the purpose of breeding bacteria that were able to metabolize waste products from the production of nylon.",

   "Evolution: Change in allele frequency in a population over time.\n\n Precisely. I learned that definition more than 30 years ago and I have never met, either in person or on the internet, a biologist who disagreed. Of course, my first course in evolutionary biology had genetics as a prerequisite. That, along with other basic courses had laid the ground work so that I was able to understand the statement. I understood what an allele is. I understood what frequency meant. I knew the meaning of the word population. Finally, I was clear that time meant over generations.\n \nSo....where is your tautology,\n\n I think that if Montalban is anything, he is opportunistic. Someone (Ungerdunn I think) pointed out to him that the phrase, \"survival of the fittest\" reduces to a tautology. As seems to be his bent, Montalban generalized that fact to claim that somehow evolution is a tautology. As I mentioned in a previous post, without further criterion, \"survival of the fittest\" is a tautology. But Darwin did offer further criterion in chapter after chapter years before he acquiesced to use the phrase. Certainly Montalban has read \"Origin\" since he quotes it. How is it that he missed chapter 2? How is it that he failed to understand Darwin's meaning in chapter 1?\n \n But I will concede that \"Origin\" is not an easy read. Understanding requires a command of English beyond the ordinary, as well as an understanding of biological science at a graduate level. Darwin was not addressing a popular audience, even though his book became popular. Darwin was addressing the naturalist of his day - what came to be called biologists in our day. English grammar and usage has evolved since Darwin's day and biology has advanced. When one considers the importance to evolutionary theory of what Darwin said (even without the misunderstandings of the uneducated), it is a matter of historical significance only. Darwin's theories have been supported or falsified many times over. For the most part, his theories have been supported. He was wrong on some minor points. Essentially, a quote from Darwin without reference to some meaningful publication since is quite meaningless.\n \nmutually exclusive theory,\n\n Like you, I have no idea what that is supposed to mean. Certainly, the leading edge of any field of scientific research may yield mutually exclusive hypotheses. After investigation, we hope that we will gain enough knowledge to support one or the other. One certainly hopes that Montalban isn't referring to natural selection vs. artificial selection as mutually exclusive theories. That would demonstrate a most profound level of ignorance.\n \nand redundant terms? I'm not seeing it there.\n\n Well, I'm not seeing it in anything that Montalban has presented. I don't doubt that it may be possible. I can't think of an example, but I accept the possibility that there may be redundant terms. Since both terms carry the same meaning for me, I am not even aware that they exist. I can see how it would be confusing for the uneducated. I can understand how the use of such terms might be a matter of preference or education for any given biologist. More than once another biologist and I have hashed out such terms, only to find that we were talking about the same thing. But such redundancy is so trite that I can't remember specific examples.\n \n My response tends towards, \"so what?\"\n \nOr are you arguing vs. some definition of evolution that you haven't yet presented?\n\n I suspect that he is arguing to preserve his faith. His faith gives him a sense of security. He is saved and you are not. In the back of his mind he sees that his faith is nothing more than the mythology of an ancient people, and he feels the need to support it with science.\n \nLet's see some bullet items to debate, not the sea-of-montalban's-ideas\n\n And of course, the sea of Montalban's assertions as science, the sea of Montalban's out of context quotes, or the sea of Montalban's misrepresentations of what others have said. It seems that Montalban knows the \"TROOTH\" and won't be discouraged with facts. Sadly, Montalban knows what he believes and reality seems to be irrelevant.",

   "\"They believe that mechanistic evolution is just too improbable.\"\n \n Ah... do they now. You see, Berkinski et al seem to have a limited comprehension as to what causes life to change in space and time.\n \n Where they see improbability I see inevitability- life, in whatever form we care to discuss, is vying to survive against a whole battery of challenges. Some of those challenges confront it on a short term basis- the need for food, suitable environmental conditions in which to survive and so on. Others may be an issue over a longer period of time- the need to find a mate and reproduce, can it survive annual changes in local climates. Ultimately, life has to be able to adapt to the longest term changes- like a major shift in underlying climatic conditions or local topography.\n \n And so on- we can consider a whole host of changes that confronts life at various times over different timescales. What is clear from such consideration is the never ending need for life to able to adapt- the Earth is a dynamic and forever changing place (even the very ground beneath you now is transient in nature) and environments have changed dramatically over the course of this planets history. If life were still and static it would never have come to be in the first place. If it can not adapt to a new challenges quickly enough- well just think of all the examples we have of life that is extinct.\n \n So I really cannot see why Berkinski and his peers find natural evolution, or whatever you care to call it improbable- the driving forces are there to see if you are inclined to learn about them.\n \n What I really find improbable is the notion of an omnipotent supernatural enitity outside of the physical universe somehow being able to comprehend and interact with the life in ours- and even to have the desire to do so!\n\n \n I believe you've missed the point. He's not against evolution; change of species over time into other species. He in fact, from what I can gather, does indeed believe in evolution\n \n He's arguing that it didn't come about through materialistic processes.",

   "Guidance by humans in the blind Watchmaker does not stop it being a reasonable analogy for his idea that no higher intelligence is in evolution but it can produce . In the analogy the guidance by humans represents natural selection. You could represent the rules of natural selection as set of equations with random elements that contained no human ingenuity instead but I don't see it as a crime to use a human forced to act under restrictions to represent that has nothing to do with humans. \n I will show you\n You could describe electrons as things that hate other electrons but like positive charges. If some electrons see other electrons coming at them down a wire they will also move down the wire to avoid them. If it means going through a circuit an powering a light globe to do the electrons will still flow if the circuit is complete. Now lets think about whats happening, each indivual electron hates large group of electrons coming towards it but to get out of the way it will have to get closer to other electrons (those punks). So if you increased the cross sectional area of the wire then the resistance will decrease. What about a double adaptor? All it does is let the current go through two different circuits. Now if there are two light globes will they both glow half as bright? No. Why because the resistance is halved and there will be twice as much total electron flow. \n \n A lot of laws in electric circuit theory made sense to me when I imagined I was an electron going through a wire and how happy I would be going down a wire. Electrons are not happy but I still had an analogy that gave me answers so I was happy. I would have been better off being told that voltage is joules per coloumb so the voltage drop between circuits must be the same.\n\n Again, it's not the point. There are many who don't deny evolution, they believe it was guided. Showing examples of guidence - through artificial selection supports this theory",

   "Darwin says that even when man did it by accident, it was artificial... \n\n \nYou seem to have trouble creating working links. Here is a corrected link to your quote. \n\n You seem to think one example is the norm.\n \nDarwin, Charles. On the Origin of Species - 6th Edition. Chapter 1 - Variation Under Domestication.\n Do a find on, \"Hence it must be assumed\" to see the quote in context.\n Your intent might be misinterpreted by some who have not read \"Origin\" and are unfamiliar with Darwin thoughts. To the uninformed, your claim about what Darwin said could easily be misinterpreted to mean that even accidental changes to the environment by man that cause evolutionary change in populations is \"artificial selection.\" Of course, you couldn't have meant that, since that is clearly not what Darwin was talking about. The context of the quote that you cite makes that clear. The whole context of the quote is in the chapter on Variation Under Domestication. Darwin does not discuss accidental changes to the environment in that chapter. That certainly would be more confusing than profitable in a chapter in which Darwin was attempting to explain the basics of his theory with examples from domestic animals, especially pigeons. It is abundantly clear that Darwin was referring to the selection by man of breeding stock since he remarks that in the domestication of a species man \"...intentionally or by chance picked out...\" characteristics. Of course, by use of the word \"chance\", Darwin meant characteristics that existed in the individuals of the breeding stock that were selected for other reasons, i.e., intentionally.\n\n Firstly I am not saying that this chapter is about natural selection. It is about artificial. I am suggesting that Darwin recognises as artificial selection something that is selected by man on purpose, or by chance. The whole issue about the Nylon Bug that I'm talking about here is whether the accidental outcome of an artificial event is 'natural'. I would say that it is not. When man designed nylon, they didn't have all the purposes in mind. Nylon is used for a huge number of things. One of these is food for a bug. Man didn't intended this but his interference; in introducing it, has allowed this to happen. It is therefore not 'natural'. Thus Darwin himself classes as artificial either the purposeful selection process by man, or where man changes things by chance.\n Thus if you have two animals (a male and a female) of different stock, and you put them on a farm together, and the male accidentally gets into the pen with the female and voila, you get an offspring that you think is groovy, then this is artificial selection; the whole process of bringing them to the same property can not be ignored.\n The key to Darwin's idea of artificial selection is the following\n \" but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species\"\n He picked something out with intent, or by accident.\n http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-origin-of-species-6th-edition/chapter-01.html\n This is further re-enforced by such terms as\n \"...it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man, as to be quite prolific under confinement.\"\n (Ibid)\n That man in a less than fully civilized state; by this he means quite un-learned and barbaric (given his Victorian values) was able to breed species - that is without any great scientific presumptions at all.\n [quote=Montalban]But this line seems blurred in the quest for evidence of 'natural' natural selection. \n \nI'm not sure what you mean. Your quotes from dictionaries certainly give no indication of any blurring. I'll give you another definition acceptable to biologists.Natural selection is the process by which organisms well adapted to their environment survive to produce offspring while those more poorly adapted may not. In this way, particular combinations of genes are propagated differentially.\n\n And how does this compare to your ideas on artificial selection?\n \nInterestingly enough one of those above also states...\n 1. artificial selection \n Definition: \n The selective breeding by humans towards a desired trait in a plant, animal, or other organism which is of value (usually economic) to the humans. The process operates on the same principles as natural selection.\n But man has a purposeful process. This would mean 'nature' also has purpose in it's 'selection' process. \n\n \nThat's ridiculous. The purpose imposed by man is what makes it artificial in the first place. You have the idea expressed in the definition backwards. It isn't that natural selection operates on the same principles as artificial selection, but the reverse. The principles are that differential reproductive success will have an effect on the gene pool of the species.\n\n The definition says in both natural and artificial cases a 'selection' is given. In one, obviously we agree that selection is purposeful how then are the analogous as the definition suggests when there is no 'purpose' in selection processes of nature?\n [quote=Montalban]It seems some people can't help wishing purpose on evolution. Which is why, in order to give examples of Natural Selection, a textbook will state... \n \nStrange that you seem to miss the meaning of your own quotes. Of course the phrase, \"survival of the fittest\" is a tautology.\n\n Which Darwin thought was a superior phrase.\n \nBut you ignored an important part of your own quote, \"Thus, without an independent criterion for fitness, other than survival,...\" And of course, Darwin did most certainly express other criterion besides survival. Let me help clarify for you. Survival is not the sole requirement, or even the most important requirement. It should be quite clear to even the most muddled thinker that reproduction is required. In fact, reproduction is the most important requirement. Survival is necessary only long enough for an organism to reproduce, and if an organism doesn't reproduce, it is an evolutionary dead end no matter how long it survives. You see, as was mentioned in your definitions and in comments, natural selection is differential reproduction. Natural selection is not a tautology. Only the phrase, \"survival of the fittest\" reduces to a tautology.\n\n Which, as stated, Darwin thought was in fact a better phrase, or 'more accurate'...\n \"But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.\" \n \n from the 6th edition of \"Origin of the Species\"\n \n http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-origin-of-species-6th-edition/chapter-03.html\n \n \nEvolution it seems can contain tautology, mutually exclusive theory, and redundant terminologies. \n\n \nAgain, I'm not sure what you are talking about. Can you give some examples? Of course a popular phrase applied to one evolutionary mechanism may reduce to a tautology when expressed without adequate criterion. But what about mutually exclusive theory? Certainly it is possible that two theories may be mutually exclusive before some mechanism is understood enough for us to determine which is correct. There are still answers that we don't have.\n Anyway, please give some examples. It isn't very instructive when you just drop off with some throw-away comment given without evidence or support.\n\n Mutually exclusive theories;\n I cut and paste from another thread...\n What must now seem a long time ago (1986), I did a course at university called 'Pre-history'. Our textbook was\n \n Poirier, F E, \"In Search of Ourselves: An Introduction to Physical Anthropology\", (to which I will be referring specifically to p346ff unless otherwise stated).\n \n As to the ascent of man (though it says 'descent'; itself a loaded term), there were many different theories then that had currency. Each followed scientific method, and each had its fair share of evidences to support it.\n \n My textbook stated that each of the following;\n \n the Unilinear School;\n \n the Polyphyletic School'\n \n the Preneanderthal School; and\n \n the Presapiens School\n \n were all valid possibilities to the pathway our ancestors took. This seemed ludicrous to me (then, and still), that each mutually conflicting theory would be accepted (as long as it doesn't involve God). And yet people can say that the evidence points to a conclusion... that is a Godless process took place. Then these people have the hide to laugh at religious people as if they have 'truth'. What 'truth'? It's all up in the air.\n \n \n \n That is, so long as a materialistic process is described, based on the evidences, it was presented. The problem? There are three other theories that also fit that limited bill, and they exclude each other. So you have someone saying something like \"Evolution is based on evidences\"... but this then becomes meaningless if you've got evidences that can be interpreted to several different totally conflicting ideas.\n \n \n \n How are these theories mutually conflicting?\n \n \n \n Generally, because they each propose a different pathway or series of pathways for human evolution. \"Various possibilities have led to various interpretations... Variation of these theories are endless; they are constantly being revised and rejected.\" p346 (Ibid)\n \n \n \n Specifically, for instance\n \n The Unilinear School diagram goes\n \n Java Man - Neanderthal - Moderns\n \n The Polyphyletic School starts off with an unknown ancestral group and immediately branches into four distinct forks (which I'll term here for convenience 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd')\n \n 'a' goes Java - Solo - Wadjak - Australians\n \n 'b' goes Peking - Upper Cave - Mongoloids\n \n 'c' goes Rhodesian - Boskop - Africans\n \n 'd' goes Tabun - Skul - Cro-Magnon - Europeans\n \n That is, simply, one (the Unilinear) has a single route for all forms of man, another (the Polyphyletic) has many different and separate routes. Please note again, this was a textbook in 1986 however at the time of publishing, the so-called 'empirical' evidences pointed to at least four different pathways.\n \n \"The controversies about evolution lie in the realm of the relative importance of various forces in moulding evolution.\"\n \n http://www.icr.org/pubs/imp/imp-333.htm\n \n \n \n Today new mutually exclusive theories are put forward; the Afro-centric model, and the mulit-regional model (see book refs below). \n \n \n \n Multi-regional\n \n \"Race And Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction \"\n \n by Milford Wolpoff, University of Michigan and Rachel Caspari, University of Michigan \"Race and Human Evolution is a far-ranging account by leading researchers in the field that describes the latest scientific evidence and the conflicting theories about human evolution.\" \n \n http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/perseus-cgi-bin/search\n \n \n \n Afro-Centric\n \n African Exodus: The Origins of Modern Humanity\n \n In sharp contrast to the multiregional interpretation of hominid development offered by Milford Wolpoff and Rachel Caspari in Race and Human Evolution (LJ 12/96), Stringer, director of the Human Origins group at London's Natural History Museum, and McKie, science editor of the Observer, argue for a single-origin theory for the recent emergence and essential unity of our species.

Artificial selection was never proposed as evidence but rather as a more familiar illustration of the principles and mechanisms of evolution.\n\n \n I get the idea from the textbook I quoted from earlier. It states in a simplified form. Natural selection happens. Darwin postulated it. Example of man's breeding.\n \n One flows into the other.\n \n Here is the entire quote again...\n \n \"Bethell began by pointing out that Darwinian theory is a tautology rather than a predicative theory. (The term tautology means a statement that is true by definition.)* That is, evolution is the survival of the fittest. But who are the fittest? Obviously, the individuals who survive. Thus, without an independent criterion for fitness, other than survival, we are left with the statement that evolution is the survival of the survivors. This indeed is a tautology. But it is possible to assign independent criteria for fitness. Darwin wrote extensively about artificial selection in pigeons, in which the breeders' choice was the criterion for fitness. (Many novel breeds of pigeon have been created this way.) Artificial selection has been practiced extensively by plant and animal breeders. Here too, survival is not the criterion for fitness, productivity is.\"\n Robert H Tamarin, (1996) \"Principles of Genetics\" (5th ed), p571.\n \n \nA good example is the Typing Monkeys scenario \n\n \nAnother assertion without offering any evidence as to why you are correct. None of the quotes you give offer purpose as randomness.\n \n It is bizarre to see someone calculate the odds that something will happen after it has happened. It is even more bizarre to see that someone read all of those quotes and apparently missed the context in which they were presented. Certainly none of them were meant to present purpose as randomness. You seem to have missed to point of your own quotes.\n\n Which of my quotes are you talking about? You dismiss all of my quotes, when I quoted from several sites; those supporting the 'monkey' (or similar) scenario, and those that debunk it. You've dismissed the for and the against.\n Further, you seem to miss that it is Dawkins who calculates the odds after the event.\n \nIt doesn't do this, because proponents of natural selection rule out 'ends'... other than survival, and survival simply come about because organisms survive (hence the tautology of \"Survival of the Fittest\" which Darwin himself felt was a superior phrase to \"Natural Selection\"). \n\n \nAs was pointed out in some of your own quotations, survival is not an 'end' of natural selection. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favourable suites of characteristics. It is a statistical tendency. Individual organisms may work to survive, but they also work to reproduce. That's as close as it gets to \"purpose.\" And as you know, Darwin's favoured term was natural selection. He never used the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. Since Darwin's time \"survival of the fittest\" has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory.\n\n Again you dismiss the whole case of both sides as I presented. I'm not sure if you want to dismiss your own side's argument as well as mine.\n I'll run by this once more\n In order to demonstrate the viability of the random gene mutation theory Dawkins and others are faced with a mammoth task.

It's quite funny it's another one of your 'if I close my eyes to the evidence, I won't be able to see it' posts.\n Perhaps if you actually read the posts with regards the mutually exclusive theories with regards to the ascent of man. Of the tautology that is \"Survival of the Fittest\"\n\n \n Strawman? Surely you jest. Let's hit instant replay on that.\n \n \n\n MONTALBAN: Evolution it seems can contain tautology, mutually exclusive theory, and redundant terminologies. \n \n MACH: Definition Evoluition: Change in allele frequency in a population over time.\n \n MACH: So....where is your tautology, mutually exclusive theory, and redundant terms? I'm not seeing it there.\n\n \n So, have you shown us where in that most common of accepted defiinitions of evolution where it \"contains\" tautology, mutually exclusive theroy, and reduntant terminologies? OHHHHH. You mean the things YOU wrote about evolution contains those things. That's arguing against something other than evolution, now isn't it Montalban? Wiggle out of it please, post 20 pages of quotes and links and new terms to debate...but KEEP MISSING THE TARGET.\n \n Wait, where is the tautology? Maybe...allele frequency? Shoot, no that's not it. How about, \"Change in\"....nope not one either. Where is the mutually exlusive theory? Is \"population over time\" mutualy exclusive? Nope.\n \n You see, when you summarize, you have to make your thoughts more clear and refined, and then we can address your issue(s) efficiently. Not this big word scramble and quote fest that leaves your points scattered all over. Please reduce your arguments into clear, concise arguments if you value your audience's time.\n \n \nHow can you see them if you don't read them? This is really one of the funniest debating techniques yet developed.\n I've stated this particular one in post 32 of The Moon Dust Theory, to which you responded (I take it you were debating without seeing then, too!)\n\n ... and each time I ask you to clarify your point(s) in short, concise summaries so that I can debate specific topics rather than your broad, generalized, nonsense that inevitably leads to strawmen all over the place. I have taken the time to reponse to some of these posts with over 20 points, that's simply ridiculous, inefficient, clumsy, and overall suspect debating technique. We aren't debating 20 things here, we're debating ONE thing, maybe two at a time, so why these 1-2 points cannot be clearly stated means it's either beyond your ability, or you are unwilling. Or, please present another reason, if it's less than 400 words I might read it.\n \n Again, in case you missed it:\n \n \n\n MONTALBAN: Evolution it seems can contain tautology, mutually exclusive theory, and redundant terminologies. \n \n MACH: Definition Evoluition: Change in allele frequency in a population over time.\n \n MACH: So....where is your tautology, mutually exclusive theory, and redundant terms? I'm not seeing it there.\n\n \n If you need to restate your argument, please do so. Your current argument that \"evolution contains XYZ\" is strawman.\n \n \n --- And don't drag in your post on Moon Dust..you still have yet to reponsd..but let's give the readers here a glimpse since you brought it up as a point, since it's equally appropriate here ----\n \n Montalban: Why I am not anti-science\n (In arguing you are not anti-science you write)\n \"The scientific establishment bears a grisly resemblance to the Spanish Inquisition\n \n So. While I think things like this are funny, I don't think they help your case. The Catholic Church was responsible for the killing of other humans if they did not believe their dogma, or in many cases, if they just ticked them off.\n \n Sorry, biological science has clean hands on that one Montalban. \n \n Here's another Monty classic. Please read this folks, it's another strawman captured in slow motion footage:\n \n \nThe epistemological case: it is why evolutionary theorists can present mutually exclusive theories and yet still keep a straight face when they tell creationists that evolution is true, because it has all these evidences - evidences that point to what? Evolution. It's such a hollow claim.\n\n \n \"evolution is true\" Please refrain from arguing against this nonsensical strawman. You cannot pass this off yet again in another post.\n \n \"Evidence for evolution points to evolution\" is a hollow claim you say. So you are good at making up phrases, then debating against them. You're doing it yet again.\n \n All evidence points to evolution, would be a more accurate statement. Your addition of the word \"evolution\" at the beginning is another not-so-deft manuever to confuse the sleeping reader.\n \n While interestingly enough, religion with it's...oh...word of mouth evidence only, no other verifiable evidence at all, is more along the lines of your \"hollow claim\"...wouldn't you say? \n \n So the things you dislike \"the grisly inquisition, and hollow claims\", are both part of religion and not science?

I am suggesting that Darwin recognises as artificial selection something that is selected by man on purpose, or by chance.\n\n Duh. So you are suggesting that Darwin meant exactly what he said? How bizarre.\n \nThe whole issue about the Nylon Bug that I'm talking about here is whether the accidental outcome of an artificial event is 'natural'.\n\n You're mixing language. Darwin specifically mentioned picking out characteristics intentionally or by chance. He didn't talk about accidents and he was not discussing accidental effects on the environment by man.\n \nI would say that it is not.\n\n But you say a lot of things that are pretty silly.\n \nWhen man designed nylon, they didn't have all the purposes in mind. Nylon is used for a huge number of things. One of these is food for a bug.\n\n One of the \"purposes\" of nylon, even though it man didn't have this purpose \"in mind\" is as food for a bug? So therefore, even though man wasn't aware of the existence of this microbe (it's still not a bug - and it would seem that since you are trying to discuss science you would make an effort not to sound like a 5th grader) it is still selection by man. In other words, no purpose, no intent, and not even any knowledge of the microbe.\n \nMan didn't intended this but his interference; in introducing it, has allowed this to happen. It is therefore not 'natural'.\n\n Man didn't introduce it.\n \n Thus Darwin himself classes as artificial either the purposeful selection process by man, or where man changes things by chance.\n\n Right. And there was no purposeful selection in the case of the microbes that live in the waste products of the production of nylon.\n \nThus if you have two animals (a male and a female) of different stock, and you put them on a farm together, and the male accidentally gets into the pen with the female and voila, you get an offspring that you think is groovy, then this is artificial selection; the whole process of bringing them to the same property can not be ignored.\n\n No wonder you flunked biology. Of course, what you are now discussing has nothing to do with anything that Darwin said. Of course, you would have to read and understand what Darwin said to comment.

You haven't read Darwin and you flunked a high school course in biology but you can tell us the key.\n \n I can assure you that you have not given the \"key\" to artificial selection according to Darwin. Furthermore, you again introduct the word accident. It seems that you failed to understand your own quote. Darwin didn't say anything about accident. Darwin used \"artificial selection\" to mean the intentional breeding of domestic animals. His intent was not that changes in the growth of bacteria as a result of the accumulation of feces was artificial selection.\n \nThe definition says in both natural and artificial cases a 'selection' is given. In one, obviously we agree that selection is purposeful how then are the analogous as the definition suggests when there is no 'purpose' in selection processes of nature?\n\n It is clear that you fail to grasp how analogy works as an instructional device. I already explained this to you once but it seems that you are having trouble grasping the meaning.\n \n As for the rest of your response, what is your point? As I said, as theories develop there are sometimes several hypotheses proposed that explain the observed data. So what if opposing hypotheses exist? That's how science works - formulate and test predictions that are the necessary consequence of the hypothesis.\n \n You object to the fact that none of these theories propose, \"god did it.\" How is that supposed to be tested. You see, it really doesn't matter what observation you may make, \"god did it\" shuts off any search for knowledge.

It came about 'by chance' or 'by accident', as it wasn't your intended outcome, but the outcome could not have come without your actions. If you have an alternate meaning, then introduce it, don't be afraid. But it's harder to do then just repeat mantras such as 'You're wrong\". :) It takes actually coming up with ideas.\n \nThe definition says in both natural and artificial cases a 'selection' is given.

So what if opposing hypotheses exist? That's how science works - formulate and test predictions that are the necessary consequence of the hypothesis.\n\n It is upon these types of hypothesise that evolution is taught as having happened. People are told 'man evolved from lower forms... theory based on the evidence', but on closer inspection the evidences point to so many different things that the theory of evolution seems utterly useless if all it says, at the end of the day, that evolution 'happened'.\n \nYou object to the fact that none of these theories propose, \"god did it.\" How is that supposed to be tested. You see, it really doesn't matter what observation you may make, \"god did it\" shuts off any search for knowledge. Those who propose that \"god did it\" is a scientific answer are bad scientists with weak faith.\n\n Not at all. Intelligent Design theorists have no such problem of being 'shut off' from the pursuit of knowlege, far from it; your version is more shut off, because if it were true that God did act, you can't recognise it, they can. Their search for scientific truths are able to accomadate an answer that lies outside the constrictions of materialism. It is at the end of the day a 'just-so' argument writ large.a",

   "You seem to have trouble creating working links. Here is a corrected link to your quote. \n \n Darwin, Charles. On the Origin of Species - 6th Edition. Chapter 1 - Variation Under Domestication.\n Do a find on, \"Hence it must be assumed\" to see the quote in context.\n \n Your intent might be misinterpreted by some who have not read \"Origin\" and are unfamiliar with Darwin thoughts. To the uninformed, your claim about what Darwin said could easily be misinterpreted to mean that even accidental changes to the environment by man that cause evolutionary change in populations is \"artificial selection.\" Of course, you couldn't have meant that, since that is clearly not what Darwin was talking about. The context of the quote that you cite makes that clear. The whole context of the quote is in the chapter on Variation Under Domestication. Darwin does not discuss accidental changes to the environment in that chapter. That certainly would be more confusing than profitable in a chapter in which Darwin was attempting to explain the basics of his theory with examples from domestic animals, especially pigeons. It is abundantly clear that Darwin was referring to the selection by man of breeding stock since he remarks that in the domestication of a species man \"...intentionally or by chance picked out...\" characteristics. Of course, by use of the word \"chance\", Darwin meant characteristics that existed in the individuals of the breeding stock that were selected for other reasons, i.e., intentionally.\n \n I'm not sure what you mean. Your quotes from dictionaries certainly give no indication of any bluring. I'll give you another definition acceptable to biologists. Natural selection is the process by which organisms well adapted to their environment survive to produce offspring while those more poorly adapted may not. In this way, particular combinations of genes are propagated differentially.\n \n B suggests no such thing. B suggests that the change is a result of adaptation to the environment.\n \n That's ridiculous. The purpose imposed by man is what makes it artificial in the first place. You have the idea expressed in the definition backwards. It isn't that natural selection operates on the same principles as artificial selection, but the reverse. The principles are that differential reproductive success will have an effect on the gene pool of the species.\n\n \n Lordy! This nonsense about \"natural\" and \"artificial\" selection has gone on too long.\n \n Are not human beings part of nature, and part of the environment?\n \n Species survival is about the interaction between the population and the environment within which it resides.\n \n Man is part of the environment.\n \n Most of the \"breeding\" of the last thousand years has been pure luck. It was only late in the 19th century that we realised that we could intervene in the reproductive process, but of course most of the interventions failed.\n \n If we really need to make a distinction we should talk about _deliberate_ intervention, including GM, which is clearly one form of evolution.\n \n Of all of the millions, or billions of life modifications we have seen, the number of deliberate modifications is so small as to be statistically insignificant.\n \n Please do not bring up extinctions. No one has ever successfully set out to extinguish a life form. All of the extinctions have been accidental: the moa, the passenger pigeon, the dodo. The last dodo died, not to eliminate the species, but to fill a hungry stomach.\n \n If we were capable of deliberate extinction we would not be bothere with cockroaches or cane toads.\n \n Yes, evolution is a tautology. \"Survival of the fittest\" means that the fittest survive.\n \n Anyone who argues with a tautology is unfit to survive.\n \n Izzy\n :xbanghead",

   "My response, included this quote, which is what it was in response to. Evolution most certainly doesn't \"contain\" these things, given the widely accepted definition of evolution that I posted..and that you've read countless times on this same forum. So no, I'm not mixed up.\n\n He said it is a tautology. I said it contains amongst other things, tautology, mutually exclusive arguments etc. I have already detailed where the tautology lies;\n with Darwin's use of \"Survival of the Fittest\" which he claimed was a better term than \"Natural Selection\", and I've already stated where the mutually exclusive theory lies; with different ideas with regards the ascent of man.\n Therefore I suspected, as it turns out, wrongly, that you had mixed me up with this other poster; because I've already stated my case - although you've argued that\n a) it's too large/complex/full of citations and\n b) that you give a particular definition of evolution and say that it of itself contains no tautology in the wording thereof...\n But in short, you argument rests on the wording of a definition. Not the theory as a whole.\n I still don't understand why you don't take him to task as what he has said is more severe a criticism of evolution; saying it is rather than contains.\n \nI am \"curious\" however, why you're now saying that you are arguing that a tautology is a tautology? It seems...misleading the way you try to broaden the tautology of one phrase, to all of evolution, as seen in your statement \"evolution contains tautology\".\n\n Not at all. The theory of evolution contains many many things.\n \nAgain, I think it's lack of clarity, possibly intential lack of clarity, in favor of casting doubt on the theory of evolution. Which of course, isn't being debated in science, on the whole. It is being debated by religious people, but that's to defend a dogma, not to understand the world through rational belief.\n -Mach\n\n I understand that many people who are against evolution are religious. But I was pointing out that many people who argue against it, who aren't religious, get labelled as fundamentalist anyway.\n \n I've no where else to post this at the moment, but I'd still like to use it :)\n Note also this false statement from a \n \"\"Survival of the fittest\" is a poor way to think about evolution. Darwin himself never used the phrase. What Darwin said is that heritable variations lead to differential reproductive success. This is not circular or tautologous. It is a prediction which can be, and has been, experimentally verified [Weiner 1994].\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA500.html\n This is quite clearly wrong as Darwin did use it in the 6th ed of Species.",

   "Oh, I just got in the post \"African Exodus: The Origins of Modern Humanity\" by Stringer and McKie - it has one of the theories on the ascent of man.\n\n Wow! I read the book 8 years ago.

Stringer is one of the leading authorities on Neandertals.\n \nI'm waiting for antoher book, containing a theory that says something quite the opposite; they are mutually exclusive theories.\n\n Wolpoff? Stringer states the majority opinion. But that is not your problem. You want science to be the absolute truth. To a creationist any scientific theory, once stated, must be the absolute and never changing truth. An objection to two mutually exclusive scientific theories only demonstrates the scientific illiteracy of the objector.\n \nEarlier this year in debating Mizmaxx on this issue I was still relying on the mutually exclusive theories that I'd been taught in Pre-History at university (back in the mid 80s).\n\n Did you flunk that course too? You seem to think that a scientific theory somehow represents the absolute truth rather than a good explanation of observed facts. Only scientific illiterates equate scientific theory with truth. Scientific theories are tested explanations of observed facts. They are subject to revision or rejection upon further testing.\n \nMany of those theories have fallen by the way-side, but now new ones have arisen in their place,\n\n Certainly true. We no longer believe that the earth is the center of the universe. We no longer believe that the earth was once flooded enough to cover the higest mountain. We no longer believe that the earth is immovable. Many, many theories have fallen by the wayside. And, of course, new ones have arisen. That is how science works. But science has gone well beyond questioning that the earth is 4.5 billion years old, or that the universe is 13.7 billion years old, or that all life is descended from a common ancestor. Before you are actually accepted as something more than a nutcase, you need to present tested data that contridicts scientific theory. When you do, your theory will be accepted. If your data is conclusive, then your theory will replace the previous theories. If your data is tenusous, then more than one theory will exist.\n \nstill posing the same problem for all who believe in evolution - because they all can't be right.\n\n But they aren't claimed to be \"right.\" They are claimed to be reasonable and tested explainations for observed data. They are means to suggest further hypotheses that can be tested. Science is a process of learning. You seem to want it to be \"TRUTH\".\n \n Essentially, if you can show me that the earth does not orbit the sun, I'll accept it. If you can show me that the earth is 7 weeks old, I'll accept it. The problem is that you can't. Science isn't cast in stone (as is religion). Science is a process of learning about our natural universe. Religion is not.\n \n The argument against the fact that scientific theories change as we gain more knowledge is stupid in the extreme. Let me offer an analogy. Suppose that the air conditioner in my car fails. I take it to a competent mechanic that I trust. His initial assement is that the the compressor has failed. Later he calls me at work to inform me that the problem is a $5 high/low compression switch. Should I insist that he replace the $500 compressor? The creationist would replace the compressor.\n \nI shall hope that this book is written in a manner easily digestible by a biology failure\n\n No. As I remember, it isn't. You stand a tinker's chance in understanding the book. Moreover, since you don't even seem to be able to comprehend how mutually exclusive scientific theories can exist, your chances of understanding either book are nil.\n \n How sad that you were unable to pass a basic course in biology and yet you profess biological expertise.",

It's a simple enough point. Regardless of Wallace convincing him to use it, Darwin used it. I don't understand why you'd persist to deny this when it's in Darwin's book, unless it was an editorial mistake. Despite all your claims to having read Darwin you still leap logic by saying that he didn't use the phrase, when he did, in his book. 30 years of teaching it - your claim, has not allowed you to admit that.\n two - a 'that's a lie' response. If you had an reason not to insult, you'd bother with posting references. But you don't.\n three - an argument that I've been debated somewhere else over a point some other time - if you want to reference where you or someone else trounced me on the 'noun' debate, do so. I've challenged you time and again to put up your argument. You don't.\n four - a question over understanding English\n You seem obsessed to an un-healthy point of using the same insulting language over and over again. It is why you are so easy to spot.

I don't even claim expertise in it, either.\n \n The reason I don't mind admitting my failure in Biology is because it has not hampered me in any way in debating you time and again - and that is why you continue to make the same 'just-so' arguments - because it's all you've got.

You dare someone to do something you already believe they can't accomplish. It's as brave a statement as me saying that if you fly through the sun, I'll drink a bottle of poison.

One poster on this board (not you, not even under ANY of your UserNames) states that there is no God because there's no evidence for God - evidence based on science being the only 'evidence' he'll accept in this wager - when already defining science as being only about the natural world anyway.

It is in essence saying 'Survival of the surviivest\"\n And as you're so prone to not quote, here's one for you from a science text...(my apologies in advance to Mach who may already have stopped reading this post due to its length)\n \"From time to time, attacks on neo-Darwinism are mounted, usually by persons who either see evolutionary theory as antireligious or who basically misunderstand Darwin's theory. One attack, entitled \"Darwin's Mistakes,\" by Tom Bethell, was published in Harper's magazine.\n \n Bethell began by pointing out that Darwinian theory is a tautology rather than a predicative theory. (The term tautology means a statement that is true by definition.)* That is, evolution is the survival of the fittest. But who are the fittest? Obviously, the individuals who survive. Thus, without an independent criterion for fitness, other than survival, we are left with the statement that evolution is the survival of the survivors. This indeed is a tautology. But it is possible to assign independent criteria for fitness. Darwin wrote extensively about artificial selection in pigeons, in which the breeders' choice was the criterion for fitness. (Many novel breeds of pigeon have been created this way.) Artificial selection has been practiced extensively by plant and animal breeders. Here too, survival is not the criterion for fitness, productivity is.\"\n \n Robert H Tamarin, (1996) \"Principles of Genetics\" (5th ed), p571.\n \n Note they concede that it is a tautology; unless an independent criteria for fitness can be used - and then go on to defend 'natural' selection by an example of 'artificial' selection - in which man, akin, I suppose to nature, actively 'weeds-out' those elements he does not desire - thus nature must do the same - making intelligent choices.\n \n Even talkorigins doesn't argue in their apology that it is a tautology, just that he didn't use it\n \n (http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/tautology.html)\n \n \nEvolutionists want to claim their ethics are better than everyone elses so they call their theory of evolution \"true science\" and claim that their true science is the only form of logical thought.\n\n \n You're going to have to explain THAT one! :) My only guess is that you are referring to my QUOTES (note Mach, not paraphrase) from Dawkins who in his bid to show how rational he is, makes an irrational attack on religion.\n \n Note too, someone on your own side said\n Post 30 Is it natural?\n \nYes, evolution is a tautology. \"Survival of the fittest\" means that the fittest survive.\n\n \n \n Did you question him? Nope. Your unwillingness to engage people on your own side is interesting! Would you disagree with it if I said it?",

It seems that it is frequently necessary to instruct you in English syntax and grammar). Here is the whole paragraph that you don't seemed to have grasped.\n \nAgain, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have called incipient species, become ultimately converted into good and distinct species, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far more than do the varieties of the same species? How do those groups of species, which constitute what are called distinct genera and which differ from each other more than do the species of the same genus, arise? All these results, as we shall more fully see in the next chapter, follow from the struggle for life. Owing to this struggle, variations, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if they be in any degree profitable to the individuals of a species, in their infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to their physical conditions of life, will tend to the preservation of such individuals, and will generally be inherited by the offspring. The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small number can survive. I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term natural selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient. We have seen that man by selection can certainly produce great results, and can adapt organic beings to his own uses, through the accumulation of slight but useful variations, given to him by the hand of Nature. But Natural Selection, we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready for action, and is as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as the works of Nature are to those of Art.\n\n Notice that Darwin didn't say that the term was better but specifically linked it to comparisons with artificial selection.\n \n But it doesn't matter anyway. The phrase has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because is is so misrepresentative of natural selection. Your original argument was that the phrase was at the heart of evolutionary theory. Nope. You didn't even know that Darwin didn't coin the phrase or that it does reduce to a tautology until it was pointed out to you.\n \n And you still haven't answered the question, so what? So what that Darwin was convinced to use the term by Wallace (something else that you didn't know until informed on this board). What does that have to do with the modern theories of evolution?

   "Amazilia also argues several other things at once...\n \n That \"Survival of the Fittest\" doesn't really matter any more, even if it is a mistake, but that it wasn't, because Darwin never used it, or but only in a certain context, besides he was forced/urged to use it by Wallace, and besides that, he didn't coin it.\n \n And he accuses me of not understanding English! And that I don't understand English, because I never passed Biology!\n \n He makes some off-handed dismissal of several schools of thought that were used to describe possible ways that man evolved. He even accuses one of being a creationist notion! I'd like to see him prove that.\n He should read...\n Poirier, F E, \"In Search of Ourselves: An Introduction to Physical Anthropology\"\n \n \n \n which he alluded was both a book on Social Anthropology, and a high school text!\n\n \n While you see the need to not only debate him on points, then post an expose about your ideas of his capability, I'm still curious why you like to discuss why a tautology is a tautology. How does the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" change in any way, what evolution is, the evidence that supports it, and the fact that there simply is no strong evidence for any other mechanism by which humans have come to be, on earth?\n \n I ask because I assume you must think there is some relevance to the discussion of creation vs evolution. There might not be, that's OK too, I'd just like to make sure we don't put words in your mouth.\n \n -Mach",

   "While you see the need to not only debate him on points,\n\n Yes, how silly of me to debate him on 'points'. I should debate him on .... what?\n \nthen post an expose about your ideas of his capability,\n\n And here you are again criticising one side, and not the other. He was insulting; you remained stony silent.\n \nI'm still curious why you like to discuss why a tautology is a tautology.\n\n Because he denies that Darwin ever used it. Darwin did. Small point but he entered into all sorts of highly spurious rationales rather than accepting this point (again you were stony silent on this)\n \nHow does the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" change in any way, what evolution is, the evidence that supports it,\n\n What is evolution?\n \nand the fact that there simply is no strong evidence for any other mechanism by which humans have come to be, on earth?\n\n What is evidence?\n \nI ask because I assume you must think there is some relevance to the discussion of creation vs evolution. There might not be, that's OK too, I'd just like to make sure we don't put words in your mouth.\n -Mach\n\n Well that would be a first time.\n \n But why ask now, after several days, after he's gone by the wayside, after he made the claim again and again and again? You made no statement while he was claiming this false claim? Why your sudden interest in digging all posts I've responded too?",
