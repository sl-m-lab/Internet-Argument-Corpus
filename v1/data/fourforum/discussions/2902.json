   "Certainly there is no moral case for the existence of Israel. Israel stands as the realisation of a biblical statement. Its raison d'\u00eatre was famously delineated by former prime minister Golda Meir. \"This country exists as the accomplishment of a promise made by God Himself. It would be absurd to call its legitimacy into account.\"\n \n Israel's other potential claim to legitimacy, international recognition, is just as dubious. The two pacts which sealed Palestine's future were both concluded by Britain. First we signed the Sykes-Picot agreement with France, pledging to divvy up Ottoman spoils in the Levant. A year later, in 1917, the Balfour Declaration promised a national home for the Jewish people. Under international law the declaration was null and void since Palestine did not belong to Britain - under the pact of the League of Nations it belonged to Turkey.\n \n By the time the UN accepted a resolution on the partition of Palestine in 1947, Jews constituted 32% of the population and owned 5.6% of the land. By 1949, largely as a result of paramilitary organisations such as the Haganah, Irgun and Stern gang, Israel controlled 80% of Palestine and 770,000 non-Jews had been expelled from their country. \n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4111684,00.html\n \n \n A List of UN Resolutions Against Israel\n \n http://www.action-for-un-renewal.org.uk/pages/isreal_un_resolutions.htm\n \n \n Related Threads:\n \n Israeli Contempt for the UN: A Cause for War\n \n Origin of the Jewish-Palestinian Conflict Revealed\n \n Israel Hits US Taxpayers in the Wallet\n \n \n \n .",
