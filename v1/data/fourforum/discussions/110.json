Our court system was set up to avoid abuses. If say a law enforcement officer didn't like you because you had a pink car, and that car was missing a muffler, and every day it woke them up at 4 am when you started it by backfiring. You were thought to have been involved in a breaking and entering during the nighttime with the intent to commit a felony. You were arrested, tried, found innocent.

The OJ Simpson case. This of course is probably very disputable, but let us just pretend that OJ had acctaully killed his wife. After the trial he could have once again yelled for all the world to know that he killed his wife and could have told the story in great detail. Of course his kids would probably never speak to him again and a restraining order would probably go through but besides this he would get off free. This is the point I am trying to make. \n \n - If compelling evidence came up later, almost irrefutable I think that w/e the case may be should come back up again in court.

For instance you find stolen furniture in a warehouse under his name. Also a police officer I thought only takes you into custody. It is the state that files charges, and in a case such as these it would be possible for the victims of this break in not to press charges.

Fact is cops are human, and there will always be people you know got away with something, fact is most OUIs walk, especially if they are OUI narcotics, but the breathalyzer comes up on the line. If it's someone you don't like I can guarantee that there are cops out there who'd charge them again and again. All the while they lose their license until the case goes to trial. They'd be proven innocent, but anyone doing a basic background check would see if for employment, or otherwise that they've been charged with OUI.
