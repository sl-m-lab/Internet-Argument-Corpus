   "Apparently, a group known as the The Mindshare Foundation in conjunction with another group known as The Human Ant Project have collaborated on an abortion known as The World Anthem. What they did was take all the World's national anthems compile them into a database that search for common notes and lyrics. The final result was this train-wreck mentioned above.\n \n To me, this sounds like a left wing ploy designed to further erode the national sovereignty of the U.S., not to mention that it is a truly a disgusting piece of music. If any of you are interested go to worldanthem.org to listen to a sample. Get back with me and tell me what you think of the music and the idea of having a world anthem.",

As I stated before, I am used to debating with communists. Therefore, debating with rational people might take a paradyme shift, on my part. It is refreshing to see myself agreeing with a liberal for once.
