   "Today being June 26th is the anniversary of an 'incident at Oglala' which had end results including the death of two FBI agents, several peaceful protesting natives, and the false inprisonment of Leonard Peltier. Leonard Peltier was a man with ideals and honor. For his attempts to help his people and those who needed the governments help[which was NOT given to them] he was taken into custody under pretext of the FBI having incriminating evidence supporting the fact that he had killed the two FBI agents. IF he had, which is now known to be a ludicrous lie then it would have been justifiable as an act of self defence. However it was not him and there is evidence from previous prosecutors that they knew it was not him and merely wanted a scapegoat. Such continued holding of an innocent and well intentioned person is a violation of human rights. Leonard Peltier is being held as a political prisoner. Something which the Untied States [I]claims to be very against. But are they really? The answer from thier actions in this case would appear to tell the public that they do not care to uphold the laws of the land which they put in palce to ensure order and peace. Thier lack of caring and real enforcement of justice has ruined lives and families. How many people know this story? How amany are willing to do something about it? Do you think the FBI was right? Why if so were they right to imprison an innocent man for many years in terrible conditions without chance of parole, and breaking up his family and tribal ties?",
