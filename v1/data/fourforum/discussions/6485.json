   "Lithuanian authorities don't seem to be willing to get a move on decoding the flight recorder of the Russian Su-27 fighter that supposedly \"crashed\" on Lithuanian territory on Sept. 15. Besides, they also refuse to hand over either remnants of Su-27 or the pilot of the warplane, Major Valeri Troyanov, 36. I wonder, what's the ground for this? Maybe, it was no crash but the warplane was shot down by Lithuanian air defence missile system? Or, what is more likely, it was the US and Poland performing secretly warlike preparations against Byelorussia on the territory of Lithuania and the Russian Su-27 was shot down by accident just like it was in the year 2001 when Ukrainian surface-to-air missile downed a charted airliner with 77 people aboard? Now, Lithuania understands pretty well it would be a huge scandal if the truth comes out.",
