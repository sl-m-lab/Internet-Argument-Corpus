Miracles, superstition and mythology just isn't good enough.\n\n \n Sorry 'bout that. I said I would take a stab at it. I am involved in a debate in the tournaments thread with poet and am spending my research time there. \n \n I may not be able to give affirmative evidence for younger than 10000. I am not sure that I personally subscribe to that young. It is not completely without controversy.\n \n But I will give some info amd expand at a later time. \n \n To relate to \"if the genesis story of creation were true we would expect to see (fill in the blank)\" seems to be a good starting point. I will start with one item and add more later. We can debate that item for a bit.\n \n First, if the genesis story were true there would be evidence, indirect or direct, that things happened very quickly at the beginning of the universe. For the most part that idea has not held sway as the constancy of the speed of light seems to put a damper on that problem. We would expect that light would have been traveling far faster than it does for the creation story to hold any water.\n \n 1) http://www.aw-verlag.ch/Documents/GravityPotentialCausedByVariableSpeedOfLight.PDF\n 2) http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9908058\n \n These are two links that discuss the non-constancy in the speed of light. The second discusses to a minor degree that the laws as stated would seem to point to a speed of light far in excess of it's current speed at the beginning of the universe. Light has slowed to an asymptotic level. It can be further changed experimentally. \n \n If this were true, that light was travelling significantly more rapidly at the beginning of the universe then it would lend credance to a younger earth theory. \n \n However, there are other items to consider, geology for example and the cooling of the earth from the \"void\", the fossile record, radiation levels in the earths crust, background radiation from space, etc.\n \n I would like to address those one at a time if I might. Please consider the light speed evidence. I think the argument is sound if evidentiary weak. You ask for affirmative evidence, there it is. \n \n I do not say this proves it, but is a start. I will provide more in other areas later.",

I am doing my research in the other areas I described. Any comments on the light speed stuff. I have another similar theory concerning the asymptotic decay of radioactivity. It supports the light speed asymptotic decay as another form of radioactivity. The equations are a bit complex.

   "The first link is to an article that someone wrote and posted on the web. It is not a peer reviewed paper. If I read correctly, he is saying that at quantum levels the speed of light is variable between \"charges\", but that it varies by less than 10^-10. He says that it is so small that it cannot be measured. I have no idea how that is supposed to be evidence for creation.\n \n The second paper seems to be a discussion of the theory that the speed of light in the early universe was different. That story made the news some months ago. I'm afraid that I wouldn't get much out the 29 pages of maths. But the phrase \"early universe\" is meaningful, don't you think? He means about 13.7 billion years ago, some time in the first 10^-43 seconds of the universe, during the inflationary phase. The change is hypothetical only and has not been observed. I don't see how that is evidence for a young earth since this doesn't change the evidence that indicates that the universe is very, very old and that the earth is very old.\n \n The hairbrained idea of c-decay was stated by Setterfield. Of the 193 measurements of the speed of light over the last 180 years, Setterfield chose 120. He claims that his line of best fit shows that the speed of light is decreasing. HOwever, if you were to use all 193 measurements, you would find that the line of best fit would show that it is increasing. It seems to be a matter of our ability to accurately measure the speed combined with a judicious selection of data.\n \n Morton points out that if Setterfield is correct, there would have been about 417 days per year in the year 1 A.D. And of course, the resultant rapid radioactive would have melted the earth. So much heat would have been released that would still be molten.\n \n And I renew my request for affirmative evidence for creation. And I didn't see any hypothesis based on this evidence nor a prediction and a means of testing it.\n \n As for radioactive decay, you should read this article.\n \n How to Change Nuclear Decay Rates\n \n Additionally, supernovas produce known radioactive isotopes. Gamma radiation from the decay of Co-56 and Co-57 fades at a predictable rate. Since the decay of gamma radiation from SN1987A (169,000 light years away) and SN1991T (60 million light years away) matches predicted rates, it indicates that the decay rate of these elements has been constant for 169,000 years and 60 million years.\n \n You also have the problem that there hasn't been enough time for the heat produced by this decay to escape from earth. Next, you're going to have time running faster too.\n \n Besides, there really aren't any significant problems with C-14 dating. It has been calibrated back to about 45,000 years. Most \"problems\" are caused by contamination and selection of inappropriate samples. Carbon dating is quite accurate and reliable.\n \n Don't forget, observations, hypotheses, predictions, and tests.",
