   "It seems as though Hugo Chavez isn't going anywhere, at least not for a little while. Winning the popular vote seems pretty easy when your Chavez, but it looks as though it was done legitimately. Now this has many middle class and rich folk up in arms, but I guess that's the beauty of democracy. Will Chavez be able to overcome what many believe to be incompetence and ultra liberalism? Well that's another story. \n \n For now, Chavez will remain and there is talks of staying around until the mid 2020's. You can never count out a military coup, the US has been silent as of late. Haiti's already in the rearview but exit Cuba is always on the map. You never know, the last thing that the other America needs is a liberal uprising in an area that they seem to have some kind of control.",
