I say if they want to live in a Spanish speaking country then move to one.\n\n \n You're talking about a religious law versus a language. It's ridiculous to adopt Islamic law in the United States because it would be an obvious disregard for the first amendment. Duel language signs and courts would be such a relief for police officers and those working in our courts right now. My father's a public defender, and even in Minnesota, he requires a Spanish translator in his office or the courtroom at least once a week.\n \n Language signs? We have no reason not to install them. However, the duel courts, although a superb idea, are too expensive for this country to handle at the moment, IMO.",

   "I'm not sure what the background to this is, I suspect that either it's the statement of a tiny minority of australian muslims or it's been completely misinterpreted. To me it seems like they're just saying that they're constrained by two sets of laws, not just one. They're not saying they'll ignore australian law in favour of Sharia, but that they will obey both sets of laws. I don't see a problem with that. It's also possible that they want people to be able to have a dispute between them resolved under Sharia where both parties agree to it. Again, I don't see a problem. If you have any evidence that what was being suggested was more than this, feel free to post it. Otherwise I'll be forced to conclude that the Australian government is mouthing off in the same crackpot way as Bush and Blair.",
