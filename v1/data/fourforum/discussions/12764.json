   "While a small minority of anti-gun zealots continue to push for more and more infringements on the 2nd Amendment, many Americans are choosing a different path. \n \n   More Women Buying & Carrying Weapons \n An unprecedented number of women are taking their protection into their own hands by getting a gun. Gun stores are seeing more women customers than anyone can remember. Many women are also getting permits to carry a concealed weapon. \n \n Local 12 Reporter Liz Bonis shows us why many women are in a hurry to arm themselves.\n \n Tim Harney is a retired police officer and a conceal carry instructor. He says, when it comes to demographics, Cole and many other Tri-State gun shops and agencies catering to women are right on target. Some have had so many women sign up for the conceal-carry course this year, they've had to add sessions.\n \n Others have had so many inquires from women who want to get a license to conceal and carry a weapon they are offering the course free to females. So, what's driving all this? Well, some say it's a concern about the gun laws that could change, but others say it's simply that when the economy goes down, crime goes up, and many are concerned about personal safety.\n",

   "  Democrats hang fire on guns \n There is one thing that can be said of President Obama with certainty -- his election has had a phenomenal effect on gun sales. \n Across the country, ammunition prices are soaring and many guns are in short supply as weapons fly off the shelves at stores. This is a telling economic indicator about consumer confidence as many Americans stock up for fear that the end is nigh. It's also a logical reaction to gun-owner fears that Democrats will implement far-reaching new gun controls. There is cause for concern. Leaders in the Obama administration and Congress have stated that they plan to limit what guns Americans can buy and that guns should be registered. \n \n The gun controllers are at odds with public opinion. Despite Americans constantly being bombarded with attacks on guns by an anti-gun media, Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of the Gallup Poll, notes that \"Attitudes toward gun control have become more conservative, people not wanting gun control.\" ...... Popular support for the Second Amendment isn't lost on all congressional Democrats. On May 12, 27 Senate Democrats voted with 39 Republicans to end a ban on law-abiding citizens carrying legal firearms in national parks. \n \n It's too early to celebrate Democratic respect for gun rights. Some Senate Democrats who voted for the national park amendment complained that they were painted into a corner on the issue. Sen. Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, the party's chief vote counter, told National Public Radio last week that they were concerned about \"how many more times they'd have to face such votes.\" Democrats are torn between their constituents' support for gun rights and an Obama administration committed to gun control. \n\n Ah! You are almost there Democrats, but Obama does not own the Country. We the People do.\n \n You can keep the Change, we will keep our Rights.",

   "  Re-establishing two fundamental rights \n The House on Wednesday approved the same provision 279-147, ...\n \n While some politicians and federal bureaucrats may not appreciate or respect the right to bear arms, most Americans understand that the Second Amendment was recognized by the Founding Fathers as critical to ensuring individual liberty and freedom. ...\n \n Liberty and freedom for the individual and from the government are what make our country and our Constitution unique. America, like no other nation, is founded on the principle that the individual has basic rights, which no government may infringe upon. This bill will reverse the whims of overreaching government bureaucrats who have disarmed and threatened innocent Americans, and once again re-establish two of the fundamental rights upon which our nation was founded. \n",
