   "Last Sunday Iranian diplomat Jalal Sharafi was kidnapped whilst being driven through Baghdad.\n \n Iran has blamed the US for the kidnapping, and holds the US responsible for anything that may happen to Mr. Sharafi.\n \n Some Iraqi officials have said the kidnappers were wearing uniforms of the Iraqi 36th Commando Battalion which is an Iraqi unit under US direction. There is no concrete evidence of this.\n \n U.S. authorities have denied any involvement: White House spokesman Tony Snow said, \"We don't really know a whole lot about it at this point. We know that the Iraqi government is investigating.\"\n \n This is a major diplomatic incident, (although I hesitate to use that adjective as affairs in the region can hardly be said to currently involve any diplomacy) and whoever is behind it obviously has an agenda.\n \n We have seen many examples of Shia and Sunni Iraqis kidnapping and/or killing each other, for the purpose of terrorising the population, accompanied by demands for one sect or the other to entirely leave certain areas. This is a standard tactic of intra-national war; terrorise your enemies to the point that they are coerced into becoming refugees, or what is known as ethnic cleansing.\n \n We have seen many examples of Iraqis kidnapping and/or killing US servicemen and civilians, for the purpose of terrorising the occupying forces, accompanied by demnads for ransom or withdrawal of forces. This is a standard tactic of guerilla warfare; trying to demoralise the occupiers and put pressure on the political leaders of the occupying nation. This particular factor however, has another dimension; some of those kidnappers who demand ransom are likely simply opportunistic criminals with no real political motivation; they are simply exploiting the lack of security within Iraq.\n \n We have not however, (to my knowledge) seen many (or indeed any) examples of Iranians being kidnapped. It has been four days and no demands have been issued. There are three possible scenarios:\n \n 1) The kidnappers are opportunistic criminals, and a demand for ransom will be issued.\n \n 2) The kidnappers are Sunni insurgents, who by spreading misinformation that the US is behind the kidnapping, hope to provoke an unresolvable diplomatic incident and draw Iran into the conflict. Obviously one such incident will not accomplish this, so more may be planned.\n \n 3) The US is behind the kidnapping, hoping to provoke Iran into making aggressive moves, thereby justifying some kind of action against Iran. Again, one such incident will not accomplish this.\n \n I feel that the first possibility is unlikely. Why would criminals kidnap such a high-profile Iranian, knowing the consequences for international relations, when they can simply keep doing what they have been doing? Crime is surely best kept simple. You don't want to get drawn into politics.\n \n The other two scenarios seem perfectly plausible. However, if the insurgency is supported and/or funded by Iran, it is unlikely that Iran would have given such orders; Iran does not need or want to enter the conflict directly for two reasons:\n 1) The insurgency is doing a great job on its own of causing massive problems for the coalition.\n 2) US/Iran conflict would be disastrous for the region, and factions in Iran who are supportive of the insurgency do not want regional chaos, they want a stable Iraq, empty of coalition forces, with significant (ie total) Iranian control.\n The 2nd possibility is still feasible if the kidnappings have been carried out by an independent faction of the insurgency, but if this is the case I doubt that their goals will be realised.\n \n Recently, the US administration authorised U.S. troops in Iraq to kill or capture Iranian agents \"deemed to be a threat.\"\n Last thursday US forces raided Iran's consulate in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil on Thursday and detained five staff members.\n The aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis and accompanying warships have been sent to the Persian Gulf, the first time since 2003 that the US has had two carrier battle groups in the region, in addition to the bolstering of the US army in Iraq by 21,000 troops, none of whom are replacing current troops who could be sent home. \n \n These facts unfortunately suggest to me that the 3rd possibility is the most realistic, especially as it allows a great deal of deniability and, if successful, allows US administration propaganda to paint Iran unequivocally as the aggressively posturing villain.",

   "I don't disagree that it was likely (based on the very limited info. we have, and with a heavy dose of gut feeling) involving the U.S.\n But there are a couple of things I'd point out: \nWhy would criminals kidnap such a high-profile Iranian, knowing the consequences for international relations, when they can simply keep doing what they have been doing? Crime is surely best kept simple. You don't want to get drawn into politics.\n\n Depends on the crime. Some of them would benefit no matter who was in power. Arms dealers benefit when everyone fights.\n The Iranians could have targeted their own (expendable) ppl. just to inflame anti-U.S. resentment. I know it doesn't need any help, but who says their motives have to make sense? \n That being said, I still agree that the U.S. has a hand and is attempting to provoke Iran, or simply provide justification for whatever's next.",
