   "This article makes a pretty cogent argument against 'Globalism.' The author describes a very disturbing trend, but I wish \n \n that he went into a little more detail about the specifics of how this is all happening.\n \n Title: \"The Dark Side Of Globalism\"\n Author: Tom DeWeese\n Link: http://www.politicallyright.com/article166.htm \n \n Quote: \"Globalism calls for a wrenching transformation of our society, away from representative government and independent \n \n nations to the establishment of a global village with global citizens. The entire plan is outlined in detail in the UN's \n \n Agenda 21, a treaty signed by then-President George Bush at the UN's Earth Summit in 1992.\"",

   "I've read a really good book on this topic: \"The War Against The Family\" by William D. Gairdner. Its about Canada's increasingly socialist government, but the same principles apply as to what the U.N. wants to do. I highly recommend it, since I had always been quite fuzzy in my knowledge of politics before I read it. It is interesting and riveting, as well as informative.\n \n The most alarming thing about the whole movement is the parrallels to Communism. My main objection to Tom DeWeese's article is that he paints the people behind this as malicious. Some are - in that they see people as nothing but a cancer that hurts Nature, but mostly this is done by people who honestly beleive in the value of what they're doing - without realizing what it means for us as individuals.\n \n I'm curious as to what you all think out there. Do you believe this article, or is it just a conspiracy theory? What do you think of the ability of people to govern our lives even though we haven't voted them into power? (ie: as represented in this article, and in how judges are increasingly able to remake and make laws)",

   "Globalism is an interesting subject, but the author seems to be fairly ignorant of it. Modern day globalism and internationalism has undermined the democratic capabilities of the individual nation-state. While EU, and to a lesser extent, contemporary UN has been created in response of this change. If we do not respond to an increasing amount of problems and societees being global or internationalized, rather than concentrated in individual nation-states or territories we will eventually loose our democratic ability to choose our own way of life. That is why nation-states choose to co-operate in inter-national and sometimes supra-national organisations. \n \n The author also seem completly ignorant of the meaning of sustainable development. Sustainable development means \"a devleopment that satisfies our needs, without endangering the need-satisfication of comming generations\" and this may be reached in a nu,ber of ways. And while the Bio diversity treaty is a bad idea, its is not really a part of the Agenda 21 treaty, nor has America signed the bio diversity treaty...\n \n As for totalitarianism\n UN (and EU) are volentarily (sp?) institutions.
