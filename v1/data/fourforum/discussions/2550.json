   "Recently, its become very fashionable to hate the French.\n \n Did all of this come up after they opposed the war in Iraq, or is it an older phenomenom ?\n\n \n I would answer this with two points: first, not all Americans dislike the French, some are open minded enough to think outside the box. Remember, most of the world, as well as a high percentage of Americans opposed our invasion of Iraq. Being an ally doesn't mean you have to blindly follow a country if you don't believe they're right. This war was an \"elective\" war and we chose to start it. Second, I would say the French's opposition to our invasion of Iraq is responsible for most of \"todays\" animosity from some Americans, notice I said \"some\".",

   "An anti-French feeling in the US isn't necessarily new. I think it probably started in WWII as the Allies liberated France...GIs found that a good portion of the French people treated them poorly and would do very little to aid them (keep in mind, I said portion. There were in fact many French citizens who sacrificed their lives to aid Allied soldiers, particularly in the town of Grenet.) The French were quite accomidating of the Germans, who we were fighting at the time. Parisians especially have a reputation for being particularly snotty to foreigners. And lately, alot of it has come up in the UN and the G8 Summit. Many Americans look at what is going on and they see France seemingly blocking the way of ANYTHING the US tries to do.\n \n Personally, I dislike the French government, but the reasons why I do are because of it's corruption and it's stubborn defiance of anything the US attempts. I have no problem with the French people. My dad always tells me stories of when he was on a trip in France and the people there were incredibly kind towards him. I was watching PBS when they had a special on about Grenet, a small Normandy town, and the events that took place there on and after D-Day. The people in that town I have nothing but respect and appreciation for. The French also helped us win the American Revolution.",

   "What was it the UN was supposed to be doing that they didn't do?\n\n \n The UN's ultimate solution to everything remotely close to backing up their words seems to be just standing around and waiting for it to correct itself. That is what the UN was doing before 9/11, that is what they were doing after 9/11, and that is what they were doing up until the US forced them to go in and back up their words. After that point you already had France who was angry that the US was able to push responsibility on the part of the UN and they were working to delay this war as long as possible so as to eventually force the hand of the US who was losing a great deal of money just having troops stationed in the region. This is all not to mention the corrupt oil for food program that was going on behind the scenes which was making the French, Germans, and Russians a lot of money. Is it any wonder they didn't want this war to occur? Is it any wonder none of them would support the US since their actions could uncover this sort of corruption at the highest levels of power in these countries? The entire UN should be ashamed of themselves for what happened both before the US made Iraq an issue and after it. Even more so they should be shouting down Frances proposals on Iraq right now which stand at them not supporting NATO troops in Iraq and not forgiving any debt owed by Iraq. They don't want Iraq to be successful and they don't want the US to have an easy time either. They are actively working against us even today.\n \n \nA majority of the world despises us for our unilateral action\n\n \n Ya know what? Hurray for them. I applaud those who are simply despising us for our unilateral action. I applaud Germany and Russia for standing up for what they believe is right. Not that I still support their position or corruption in the dealings with Iraq. But France didn't do just this. They went out of their way to hurt the US and will not stop this until they feel they have beaten us. An ideal situation for them would be a destabilized Iraq, an American army going home defeated, and they would love to see more negatives come from this in the future so they could point their fingers at us and say look what you did. All these other countries who despise us at least respect us enough and respect the soldiers in our military enough not to go out and intentionally try to hurt us. I'm sure that most countries who dislike this war still wish for a successful Iraq to be born and will not intentionally stand in the way of that in order to embarrass or hurt the US.\n \n \nwe're buying quality allies like Pakistan, The Sauds, Israel\n\n \n These are without a doubt our fair weather friends. If things ever went south for us they would all ignore our pleas for help. I think it is possible though that France would still be there for us. We have always been there for each other in the past when the chips were really down. I fight with my brothers once in a while but if they are ever in trouble you better believe I'll be there to support them whether they are right or wrong. The current complication we face with France is a minor bump in the road. A conflict of beliefs. But it is not the end of our relationship with each other. That is why I wouldn't say that I hate the French now or ever. I may hate their current tactics but I know they are not our true enemy. We are practically family.\n \n \nFrance and others show reason in their decisions, something we seem to have lost.\n\n \n Our reasons are not any more correct than their reasons.

A direct attack with unconventional weapons against NATO, including, obviously, an attack against the US, would result in ENDGAME for Iraq. Saddan may be a monster, but he is a greedy one.

Unknown. \n Yet the US risked it, and the USSR certainly backed down during the Cuba missile crisis. You are assuming it would go to war at that point, but we cannot know for sure. \n See the difference? The point is, the US wasn't willing to risk it at Suez, period; not for its own allies, yet it was very willing to risk it, for its own extra security, including risking the security of these very same allies, that had nothing to gain with the Cuba missile crisis, but would have been caught by.\n \n \n\n With Iraq, French support would have gone to help eliminate the world of one nasty dictator in order to bring democracy to Iraq. UN support certainly would have done this action a lot of good and probably prevent problems, not create them.\n \n\n \n You are assuming a clear-cut ending. The problem is, many do not. Many believe that the end result may be worse than Saddan regime. \n Civil war; the country becoming a recruiting nest for fundamentalist terrorists; or simply becoming an Iran part 2, all are very real dangers.

Either the UN is relevant or it is not. And if the US claims to be doing the job of the UN, then it has to abide by its rules. You cannot have it both ways.\n\n \n It is not about the UN being relevant or not. Of course they are relevant. If they were not we wouldn't even bother accusing them of being wrong as it wouldn't be worth our time. And speaking of abiding by rules, if the US believes the UN isn't abiding by rules then should the US just go along with that as well?\n \n \nWhat? How to you get to that conclusion? I honestly cannot see how you got there.\n It was the US who wanted to go to war. Not France. The soldiers were killed because there was a war, not because the French opposed the war. If the French had their way, likely there wouldn't be a war; hence no soldiers would be killed. Logic seems to dictate that if one wants someone to blame, blame those that attack the soldiers, or those that sent them there.\n\n \n I believe that the French helped rally Iraq into going to war in the first place. Saddam had to of been hoping that with France acting out as they were that they would prevent the US from going to war with Iraq. Had France just stayed quiet I would contend that Saddam wouldn't have been nearly as defiant. He may have looked for a compromise. That is where I place blame on the French.\n \n \nDid we survive the Cold War or not?\n\n \n We ensure our own survival in the Cold War by being proactive, not reactive. Same will be true of this war on terrorism.\n \n \nDon't forget. A direct attack with unconventional weapons against NATO, including, obviously, an attack against the US, would result in ENDGAME for Iraq. Saddan may be a monster, but he is a greedy one. He had no reason to sacrifice what he had just for the satisfaction of blowing up some things.\n\n \n This is to say that Saddam is a sane person. This is also to say that it isn't possible that his sons were looking to do this type of action either before or after they came to power. This is also to say that Iraq wouldn't work with any terrorists to plan any sort of attack. This is a lot to assume. The same things have to be assumed in North Korea. Had we let Iraq get to this point then things would be out of our control as they are in North Korea. That happened because we were reactive while in Iraq we will not see it happen because we were proactive.\n \n \nWould have Russia entered the war? Unknown. \n\n \n It is not unknown who would have won. The answer is no, they would not have won. A break out in the Cold War was not a war that could have been won. It would have been a loss across the board for everyone.\n \n \nYet the US risked it, and the USSR certainly backed down during the Cuba missile crisis. You are assuming it would go to war at that point, but we cannot know for sure. \n\n \n The US was taking a proactive approach here. They were not going to allow the USSR to get comfortable in having nuclear weapons this close to our borders. With the Suez conflict it would not have been a proactive way to prevent war by trying to draw Russia into a war over a canal that had no strategic advantage to the US or really even France or Britain. It just wasn't worth it.\n \n \nSee the difference? The point is, the US wasn't willing to risk it at Suez, period; not for its own allies, yet it was very willing to risk it, for its own extra security, including risking the security of these very same allies, that had nothing to gain with the Cuba missile crisis, but would have been caught by.\n\n \n Our allies in the Suez were at risk of causing a World War when there was no good reason to risk it. In Cuba, World War was almost at hand and letting it be would have resulted in a great source of tension for years and years. Also lets not forget that when those missiles were in Cuba, Castro wanted to use them. We left the fate of the world in the hands of someone who wanted to end the world. Do I see the difference? I'd hope even you can see the difference.\n \n \nYou are assuming a clear-cut ending. The problem is, many do not. Many believe that the end result may be worse than Saddan regime. \n Civil war; the country becoming a recruiting nest for fundamentalist terrorists; or simply becoming an Iran part 2, all are very real dangers. The US administration was willing to disregard these risks; others were not.\n\n \n I'm not assuming a clear-cut ending. I'm assuming a better result. You can see the results right now and they are not pretty. The UN may be bloated, corrupt, and confused, but their support would have provided better intel for us, more support from even the Iraqis, better protection for troops there, and a united effort to create a democracy. What we have today is chaos in Iraq and half of the UN trying to help Iraq be successful and the other half trying to undermine Iraq's success. It is so ugly. Now everyone's pride is involved and the end result can only go to hurt Iraq who honestly deserves a better future than what they are going to see.\n \n [/QUOTE]PS.\n Good taste in processors. emoticon_xgood[/QUOTE]\n \n At least we agree on something :)",

The US was whipped into a patriotic fever by the 9/11 event and subsequently lied to, I still consider any decision maker the responsible party, not the staff, as that's the way the business community operates, and we made a very bad call on Iraq. Politicical egos being what they are, we're stuck with it. All the humanitarian rationalization in the world won't change what we've done, and a majority of the developed world is very aware of those circumstances. We seem to be good at sticking our nose in the business of other people with self-interest as a motivator. Take a look at the mess we've made of S. America. The ME is our current target for social engineering at the point of a gun, but we're now on very slippery financial ground and this one will become very interesting as the Sauds continue to receive more attention.",

Of course, it turned out that they had realistically been in compliance fro the entire time, as their WMD's had apparently already been destroyed.\n \n The UN is going to oversee th elections of the new Iraqi government. Other than that, there is not a hwole lot they can do. Memebr nations have proven unwilling to provide troops for the endeavor, and although the US has tried very hard to shift the financial burden to the international community, it is not working. \n \n The truth of the matter is, America made this mess, so it is Americas responsibility to pay for it. The entire country is a security nightmare because America had to go int here like cowboys in some B western, so American soldiers are going to die restoring order. This is our mess, why should the international community clean it up?\n \n Maybe next time, we will listen a little better instead of simply declaring that we are going to act unilateraly.
