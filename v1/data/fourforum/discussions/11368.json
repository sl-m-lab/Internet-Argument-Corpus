   "As long as people are seeking medical treatment no less, I have no problem with this. There's no indication in the article this guy is encouraging people to avoid doctors.\n\n \n Many WofFers take a somewhat Christian Science approach to this J.\n \n They, out of one side of their mouth, will tell you to go to the doctor 'if you need too.'*\n While, out of the other side, ridicule those who do as 'not having faith in Gods word' or not even having 'faith in your faith powers'.\n They also have a tendency to exclaim that illness and imperfection is a manifest sign of sin. And those who have it should confess ALL the sin away to get better.\n This has a tendency to make the ill feel worse about themselves as they are unworthy sinners who have something wrong in their lives or are associating with someone/thing that is bringing sin into their lives. Basically, if you're not getting better or have a relapse. IT'S YOUR OWN DAMN FAULT and, while you're at it, 'take you mouth off of the passah...touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm!'\n \n *this is a form of disclaimer. Like in the movie Devils Advocate, where Lucifer tells Keanu at the end that it was in fact he that told him to deal with his wife. This helps prevent them from getting into any potential legal troubles.\n \n A prime method to build your faith is to demonstate you have it.\n Commanding God/Jesus to heal you without doubting that you have the right to do so (bible verses support this).\n Also, one can prove they have faith by 'sowing a seed in faith.'\n Of course, this seed is financial...\n \n \n These double bindish attitudes cause followers all sorts of problems and make them more dependant on their pasters every word (after all he can make sense out of the contradictions...he has 'the mind of God' indwelling in him.\n \n For example.\n 'All followers should live debt free and take care of your own.'\n 'You should cash in your 401K's sell off your property and tithe from your gross and not the net.' 'You should give to the church sacraficially (meaning until it hurts to do so).'\n \n I've know a LOT of people who believe this stuff. They are poor money managers and live in the now. Pushing debt and savings off...becasue why bother if you live for God to deal with it all for you? Why bother if we're 'living in the end times?'\n \n In the end, for these pushers, it IS all about money.\n And they are POOR stewards and POOR shepherds.\n \n \"You will KNOW THEM BY THEIR WORK!\"\n \n Why do they need bodyguards and private jets and a highly luxurious lifestyle?\n Even congress asked some to testify about their tax status in the face of such living.\n Why do their not follow the bibles commands for a shepherd?\n \n \n As for evidence.\n They (and there are many who make the same claims and have appeared on shows from 20/20, 60 minutes, even Dateline IIRC) make bombastic claims of healings and miracles but NEVER produce a shred of verifiable evidence to support their claims.\n The only thing they can do is push forward 'testimonials'.\n \n And J, it doesn't matter if he believes his claims.\n I'm sure many psychotic people have believed a lot of things that they claim.\n \n And, 100% of the WofFers Pastors and Followers I have met have exhibited some form of neurotic or psychotic tendency.\n The pastors being the scariest too.\n \n Maybe you should actually get off your duff and go visit one some time.\n Seriously. Some of you believers really should visit with these people some time.\n Followers = simple minded sheeple with MANY issues.\n Pimps = pimps who exist to exploit the above in ANY manner possible.\n \n And the sad thing is...their beliefs aren't even Christian.\n \n \n \n Now.\n I have this pyramid scheme I REALLY BELIEVE will profit all those who contribute to it.\n If you sow your investment of 100 USD, I can see you getting back 500 or more in 4 weeks time!\n And you know what J?\n I can PROVE that this scheme pays off far more than the one the WofF's push. \n Of course, for some reason, only those I like or who invested early get the returns...then the money runs out (or off with me) when there are no more investors. But, I have faith that as soon as I repackage my spiel, a new batch of investors will restart the process all over again.\n I just wish I could get the government to protect my cunning investment strategy with some law. Just like they do with religion.\n I do soo hate having to run off with the authorities on my heels at times. I lost a nice Lexus once that way. \n And it's hard owning my hard earned mansions in any other countrt than South America. At least they there are schrewd enough to have non-extradition treaties with the corrupt and oppressive America. That nation that keeps the small business believer like me down!\n \n I say, if the investor wants to put his trust and money with me, he should be allowed to.\n \n emoticon_cool",

There's no part way with God, the bible is clear that we are either for Him, or against Him. If this guy claims to have the power to heal within himself, then he is a liar and doesn't have the Holy Spirit guiding him.\n \n My point here is that that hasn't been proven to me yet based on what I personally know about him.

And as for my beliefs being my own interpretation and being self taught? I graduated from Bible College but have never been told how I must interpret the bible or what I must believe by any man or church in order to be considered a believer. My only agenda when studying the bible, is what would God have me believe. Not what would any man or church have me believe. \n Pro 1:1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:\n Pro 1:2 To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding;\n Pro 1:3 To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and justice and equity;\n Pro 1:4 To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion:\n Pro 1:5 That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:\n Pro 1:6 To understand a proverb, and a figure, The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.\n Pro 1:7 Respect for Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; [But] the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.",

In her 1957 report, Evelyn Hooker did not use a random sample to test the stability of homosexuals, but allowed gay rights activists to recruit those homosexuals most likely to illustrate her thesis that homosexuality is not a pathology. Individuals who proved unstable were deleted from the final sample.\n \n 2. Hooker's published account of how she recruited heterosexual subjects is not consistent with a more detailed later account.\n \n 3. Six subjects in her study, three from each group, had engaged in both homosexual and heterosexual behavior beyond adolescence.\n \n 4. Hooker made several errors in her mathematical calculations that raise doubts about her care and competence as a researcher.\n \n 5. Hooker did not attempt to prove that homosexuals were normal in every way, nor does her study support the idea that homosexuals as a group are just as stable as heterosexuals.\n \n 6. Hooker was relatively inexperienced in administering the Rorschach test, and this inexperience may have led to mistakes in the administration and evaluation of the Rorschach.\n \n 7. On the Thematic Apperception Test and the Make-A-Picture-Story test -- which require subjects to make up fictional narratives about depicted scenes -- the homosexuals could not refrain from including homosexual fantasies in their imaginary accounts. For that reason, Hooker altered the nature of the study by no longer asking the judges to use the TAT and MAPS in an attempt to determine the sexual orientation of each of the 60 subjects, since the differences were apparent from the narratives.\n \n In order to understand fully the nature of the controversy over Hooker's study, it is helpful to review its history.http://members.aol.com/poesgirl/hooker.htm\n \n What you actually meant to say is that you support rigorous testing of empirical evidence under controlled circumstances when it suits your agenda. When your given agenda requires a particular outcome, you're just fine with fraudulent science that ignores the accepted scientific methodologies that legitimate researchers practice.\n \n Don't bother responding to the subject of hooker as I don't want to derail this discussion.

It has been discussed at length on other boards that all atheists are agnostics... it's just that the necessary proof is so unlikely to be forthcoming as to make the distinction moot. \nThere are atheists just as devoted to supressing religion as Pat Robertson and his ilk are to promoting their twisted version of Christianity. \nSuppressing religion or promoting reason over irrationality? I think there's a difference between fervently wanting people to think for themselves and see the world as it is--show me an atheist who doesn't promote that--and trying to convince people of an entirely unwarranted genie in the sky who created everything and is primarily concerned with the sex lives of gay people. I dunno.. maybe you can't see the qualitative difference her.\nYou only have to look at the constant whining about faith schools in the UK.\n Not familiar with the situation there, but I'm open to being educated. Care to post a link? But as a side point, would you object to people objecting to schools where they teach superstition over science?\n Take a look at the comments from atheists on this forum and on others (the comment is free section of the Guardian website is a fine example), and you will find plenty of people who not only don't believe but spend their time actively trying to convert others and pouring scorn on the beliefs of others, in tones and styles matched only by the most fundamentalist of believers. \nWe have Atheist Archies here? I'm sure you'd agree that his every post is \"actively trying to convert others and pouring scorn on the beliefs of others, in tones and styles matched only by the most fundamentalist of believers.\" Quote me an alleged atheist here who does the same, in even one post much less all of them I'm an atheist, and I don't think any of my posts are similar to Archie's, Certainly I'm not trying to \"convert\" anyone to atheism. I rarely bring it up, and in any event, atheism isn't a \"conversion\" kind of thing. As I've said before, people convert people to beliefs, not non-beliefs. The closest you get is posters saying, \"Forgive me, but I think massive scientific evidence outweighs the beliefs of an agrarian society of two millenia ago.\" Sorry if that sounds fundie to you, but getting people to face reality over an old book written by people who knew little of our world in a distant ancient culture, doesn't sound like \"converting\" to me.\n \n By the way, I can't help but notice that you ignored every point I made in my previous post, prefering to launch into a subjective, unsupported ad hominem against atheists and those you claim are atheists. Is this what you consider \"making a point.\"? Presenting evidence? Rational, logical proof? No wonder you support the conclusions of Catholic priests over scientists and those who revere science above superstition.\n \n Tell you what. You present me quotes from those you presume to be these atheists on this forum that you claim indulge in the same tactics as Archie, and we'll compare them with Archie's statements. Do your worst. \n \n Then I'll compare what you've said in this thread only (I respect your opinions in other threads and on other issues) to some of the things Archie has said, and we'll let the forum see which comparison is more apt.",

If all atheists just stopped at simply disbelief in the supernatural, there would be no problem. (That's how they want to define themselves, after all.) If being 'A - theist' was where they stopped, everything would be fine. But clearly some of them use it to justify public disdain for religion. Therefore they don't all stop at disbelief--they are activists against religion and quite simply want society rid of it and some that flat out belittle it; we've seen comments right here on these fora that show that. For those, the term 'atheism' doesn't cover it. Being atheist and being anti-religious are not the same thing, and it seems that anti-religious people sometimes want to define themselves merely as \"atheist\". That's not being 'shrill'; that's being anti-religious, plain and simple. I think that when someone goes farther than simply having no belief in god and also opposes religion and argues that society is better off without it and belittles religious belief, then they are being anti-theist, not just a-theist.\n \n And by the way, if comparing is the test, then I say look back through the forum. See how many posts are anti-religious as opposed to anti-atheist. 'Course, this will have to include all the negative threads titles by Simone, the associative-fallacies that are put forth ('Hitler was a Christian!'), or the cases drudged up and posted where someone who happened to believe in prayer died of medical complications. No stone unturned! I'm pretty confident most atheists here wouldn't be particularly happy with the results of such comparison.",
