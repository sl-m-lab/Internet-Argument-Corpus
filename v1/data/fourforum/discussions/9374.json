   "People have short memories.\n \n We are less than one year into the housing correction, and most experts and media folks are saying the worst of the bust is behind us. Does anybody remember prior real estate corrections? Let's again take a look at OFHEO's HPI:\n [*]California's home prices peaked in 1990Q3, then declined for more than four years. The peak-to-bottom loss in value was 10.6%. The four years prior to the peak generated 50.4% price growth. Prices returned to the previous peak in 1998Q4, representing a 33 quarter trough.[*]Massachusetts' home prices peaked in 1989Q4, then declined for more than three years. The peak-to-bottom loss in value was 11.4%. The four years prior to the peak generated 36.4% price growth. Prices returned to the previous peak in 1997Q4, representing a 32 quarter trough.[*]DC's home prices peaked in 1994Q1, then declined for one year. The peak-to-bottom loss in value was 7.5%. The four years prior to the peak generated 1.8% price growth. Prices returned to the previous peak in 1998Q1, representing a 16 quarter trough.\n The current correction hasn't yielded a single price contraction because prices are still rising (year-over-year).\n \n Previous corrections were preceded by price spikes that were fractional relative to the recent price spikes.\n \n Previous spikes were not substantially driven by non-amortizing credit granted at very low rates to borrowers who can't repay the loans, and in many cases who never had any intentions of amortizing the loans.\n \n The worst is not behind us. The correction hasn't even started. The speculators and renters haven't started abandoning their homes. The investors haven't stopped buying the high risk MBS paper. The home builders haven't failed. The real estate agents are still driving their Hummers and BMWs. How can anyone believe the worst is behind us?\n \n Jeff\n \n http://home-economics-us.blogspot.com",

   "IMO what we are seeing currently is an intense effort to talkthe housing bubble away without any actual correction. This is not unprecedented. When the dot com bubble appeared ready to burst, hundreds of articles were written and thousands of public statements were made explainign why the dot com bubble was not really bursting. We saw the same with the ag bubble, biotech bubble, etc...\n \n It never works. You almost always get some suckers who fall for it, but in the end, the market fails and the poor suckers who believed \"this is it, that little slowdown was the whole correction\" end up getting the shaft.",
