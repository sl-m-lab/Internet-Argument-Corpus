Likewise any cell type which is called upon to reproduce or repair tissues etc. Remove the genes from a neuron and it will not last long either as it will run out of structural proteins and metabolic machinely fairly rapidly. In other words for most cell type removal of the genes will result in their failure. Does that answer your question.\n \n Oh yes RBCs have a fairly long halflife, but they cannot replace themselves, nor do they have much of a role other than carrying oxygen bound to heme.

I do not see, hoever, how any of this can be used to make an anti-Darwinian case.\n \n Biologists already know there's more to evolution than Darwinian natural selection, hells bells, even Darwin knew that!

You should check your semantics before you bleat on about words you only partially comprehend. Of course that's never slowed you down in any other context, so keep on bleating and braying. Your problem, not mine. But just for FYI--\n \n \"subordinate\n adjective\n Below another in standing or importance: inferior, junior, lesser, low, lower2, minor, minor-league, petty, secondary, small, subaltern, under. Informal smalltime. See over/under.\n In a position of subordination: collateral, dependent, subject, subservient. See over/under, part/whole.\"\n \n The usage as a value judgement applies here because it rflects the darwinist/materialist attitude towards genes and whole organisms, where genes are given primary importance, especially in evolutionary biology.\n \n The second sense, that of 'contingent' and 'dependent' is strictly a matter of objective classification and is often used in systems studies, and is not confined to human social systems at all. For instance, our moon and sun are subordinate to our sun. See--\n \"dependent also dependant\n adjective\n Determined or to be determined by someone or something else: conditional, conditioned, contingent, relative, reliant, subject.

Only you anthropocentrically expand your psychological understanding of connotations of words pertaining to human social systems to all other systems, everywhere.

   "The usage as a value judgement applies here because it rflects the darwinist/materialist attitude towards genes and whole organisms, where genes are given primary importance, especially in evolutionary biology.\n Well lets see now. You agree genes exist (thank goodness for small favors) and you admit that they store the heritable information linking one generation of individuals to the next. It is not the non-genetic machinery which serves this key role. Evolution as you know deals with heritble changes in organisms over time specifically over multiple generations. By your own admission that means that evolutionists should and indeed MUST study the heritable information store as a primary focus. Which of course means genes will be a central focus of evolutionists.\n \n On the other had energy transduction specialists will study intermediary metabolism and associated mechanisms as a primary focus. And wildlife management specialists will focus on issues like habitat, reproduction rates, and ecological factors.\n \n So far as evolution goes genes and their heritable contributions to fittness are of primary concern. Tough as they say. If you don't like it then you can do something other than evolutionary biology.\n \n Assigning subordinate/dominat judgements and trying to negate evolution thereby is a waste of your time.",
