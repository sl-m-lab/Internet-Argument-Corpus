   "Leviticus 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighbouring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Indonesians, but not New Zealanders. Can you clarify? Why can't I own New Zealanders?\n\n Are you near Indonesia? I guess I could go buy someone from Canada or Mexico but I couldn't purchase anyone from Bolivia (or any other nation.)\n \nMy uncle, a farmer, blatantly violates Leviticus 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). I have also heard him curse and blaspheme. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Leviticus 24:10-16). Couldn't I just smite them?\n\n You could, but then you'd be breaking the comandment to Not Kill.\n \nWhen I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odour for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbours. They claim the odour is not pleasing to them. How should I deal with this?\n\n Get a beef scented candle.\n \nI would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as it suggests in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?\n\n How much do you want for her?\n \nI know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.\n\n \n I don't think I'll touch that one. emoticon_xclown\n \nI have a neighbour who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?\nRefer back to the comandment not to Kill. By the way, who decides which day is the Sabbath? Does your neighbor ever take a day off and rests and reflect? That would be his/her sabbath.\n \n \nA friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Lev. 10:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?\n\n If you are allergic to shellfish than it is a greater abomination. I don't really think anyone is \"allergic\" to homosexuality to the point that they would break out in hives if they get around a gay guy.\n \n \nLev. 20:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?\n\n Wouldn't that be coincidence if you have to have 20/20 vision and it is Lev. 20:20? But why not, isn't it a good thing to be closer to God?\n \n \nI know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.\n\n Actually, the word has to change some over time because otherwise, the faith could not have spread. Could you imagine if the Bible were still only availble in Latin, the Bible wouldn't be any good to anyone.",

   "As I understood my bible thumping neighbor, the laws in the old testament no longer apply. That would include the ten commandments I suppose. According to him, we have all \"been washed in the blood of Jesus\" and are under a \"new covenant.\" We no longer have to carry the \"heavy yoke\" put on us by God under the \"old covenant.\" Obeying the laws of God no longer grant you access to heaven. You can only get to heaven now by \"professing with your mouth, before men, that you believe Jesus Christ died for your sins and was reserrected to be with his Father in heaven. Only then will you \"be saved.\"emoticon_rolleyes \n \n According to him, in the old days, God sorta held up one end of the rope and mankind held up the other. Mankind could no longer hold up his end of the deal so he sent his \"only begotten son\" (really, who uses words like begotten?) to do it for us. All we have to do now is just sorta hang on somewhere in the middle.\n \n So, if I understood him correctly, none of the laws in the old testament apply any longer. Many will argue that point and say this one DOES apply but that one Don't. I seen that useful tool of debate applied all the time in religious discussion. People seem to pick and choose scripture and align them often out of context in order to validate their argument.\n \n There is a reason polite folk do not discuss religion at the supper table. It's like dungeons and dragons. The landscape changes at every play. The subjectivity of the topic as a whole is placed on shifting sand and no true foundation can be acomplished. Therefore, all to often, the \"message of love\" becomes a shouting match or even worse, a war. But that's OK. Jesus loves you.emoticon_xangel emoticon_rolleyes",

I've never known a church setting where adultery gets off \"scott-free.\" It seems you've fallen prey to assuming that just because one message happens to get more press than the other, then it's the only message.\n\n I believe what I just bolded out in your message should clearify the reasoning behind OccamsRazor's question. If something doesn't cause a big problem in the media, then it appears to not be given any attention. Also, as far as why it's not made that big of a deal over the media is because any kind of \"Gay-Relationship\" is considered unnatural in the media or at least news worthy, while adultry happens all the time. No, I'm not saying that audultry is a good thing, I'm saying it happens all the time.",

But the anti-homosexual passages are not commandments either.\n \n \nBut perhaps more importantly (for Christians, anyway) are the admonitions against homosexual relations in the New Testament. The Apostle Paul may not have a problem with eating food sacrificed to idols, but he definitely warns against homosexual activities.\nBut what of the other NT passages that are ignored today? Just to look at Timothy 2:9-12, for example, we learn that women should not have positions of power, or wear jewellery. Where are the attempts to change the constitution to stop that happening?\n \n \n \nThere is a reason for the discrepancy between some commands and others--it's a matter of which ones are moral commands and which ones are ceremonial. The ones that are ceremonial are generally not considered important to follow any more. Commandments against homosexual relations are definitely issues pertaining to sex, and therefore are part of the moral code.\nWho is to say then what elements are 'not considered important to follow any more'? And I don't see how sex is inherently more of a moral issue than say, slavery. Yet people are quite happy to ignore the pro-slavery elements.\n \n Personally I, and I'm sure many of my fellow posters, believe the anti-homosexual passages in the Bible to be nothing more than a relic of a less enlightened time. Even if one doesn't to say that many of the rules can be ignored, but attempt to impose one's own view on others is just hypocrisy. \n \n That is not directed at you Jyoshu, btw. I know you are pro-civil partnership at least and I respect your view as such, even if I don't agree or even really understand it!",

However, now you have mentioned the latter I have more to add on that issue as well.\n \n On media representation there is a subtle distinction to be drawn on general teachings available in the public domain (the example of Roman Catholicsm is a good one) and statements that are pointedly made against gays. There are various shades of this:\n \n Legal\n \n Behind the curtains\n \n Pretty extreme (Note that for Robertson while adultery will stp you getting into heaven, the \"spread of homsexuality\" is the begining of the end of civilisation as we know it. Equal condemnation of sin? I don't think so matey!)\n \n Really extreme.\n \n You see there can be teachings and then there can be active attempts to attack, discriminate against and alienate gay people/homosexuality in general. I find it hard to accept there is any religious justification for this sort of activity. The motivator goes beyond the fight against sin so we have to look for other reasons why, and these seem to be personal dislike, prejudice and bigotry.\n \n I'll come back to teachings in a bit.... the Olympics is on at the moment! :)",

   "Ok, it all stems (like so many dubious things in the Bible) from Leviticus:\n \n \n15:19 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even. \n 15:20 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean. \n 15:21 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. \n 15:22 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. \n 15:23 And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even. \n 15:24 And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean. \n 15:25 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean. \n 15:26 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.\n 15:27 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. \n 15:28 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean. \n 15:29 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. \n 15:30 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness. \n\n \n So essentially what we have here is the Bible saying that women must isolate herself for at least a week during her period, and sacrifice two turtles or pigeons after it.
