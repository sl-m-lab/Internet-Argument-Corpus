   "Be sure to fight it tooth and nail every chance you get. My dad used to own a little store in a bad neighborhood and we had a pistol stolen from there (Browning 9mm) the gun was used in a crime and then the guy tried to sell it to a pawn dealer and was arrested. They used the gun as evidence and then wanted to destroy it! As if they had the right to destroy our property. The gun was more of a family hierloom than for self defence so we fought for it and at one point planned on a lawsuit but they returned it, with the case numbers etched on the slide (we were XXXXXX) but just happy to have it back.",

They are charged with keeping your property and returning it when they are done. Instead of taking reasonable care with it, they have defaced it. This kind of \"f - u\" attitude I'm from the government is very typical of cops, the IRS, the FBI, politicians, Janet Reno, Bill Clinton, etc. It is not that they are bad people. It is that is what happens to people when they have authority. More reason to not let the state take your guns!",
