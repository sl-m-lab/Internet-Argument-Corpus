   "A message from the NH Governor....\n \n\"My personal views on the subject of marriage have been shaped by my own experience, tradition and upbringing. But as Governor of New Hampshire, I recognize that I have a responsibility to consider this issue through a broader lens.\n \n \"In the past weeks and months, I have spoken with lawmakers, religious leaders and citizens. My office has received thousands of phone calls, letters and emails. I have studied our current marriage and civil union laws, the laws of other states, the bills recently passed by the legislature and our history and traditions.\n \n \"Two years ago, we passed civil unions legislation here in New Hampshire. That law gave same-sex couples in civil unions the same rights and protections as marriage. And in typical New Hampshire fashion, the people of this state embraced civil unions and agreed we needed to continue our tradition of opposing discrimination.\n \n \"At its core, HB 436 simply changes the term 'civil union' to 'civil marriage.' Given the cultural, historical and religious significance of the word marriage, this is a meaningful change.\n \n \"I have heard, and I understand, the very real feelings of same-sex couples that a separate system is not an equal system. That a civil law that differentiates between their committed relationships and those of heterosexual couples undermines both their dignity and the legitimacy of their families.\n \n \"I have also heard, and I understand, the concerns of our citizens who have equally deep feelings and genuine religious beliefs about marriage. They fear that this legislation would interfere with the ability of religious groups to freely practice their faiths.\n \n \"Throughout history, our society's views of civil rights have constantly evolved and expanded. New Hampshire's great tradition has always been to come down on the side of individual liberties and protections.\n \n \"That is what I believe we must do today.\n \n \"But following that tradition means we must act to protect both the liberty of same-sex couples and religious liberty. In their current form, I do not believe these bills accomplish those goals.\n \n \"The Legislature took an important step by clearly differentiating between civil and religious marriage, and protecting religious groups from having to participate in marriage ceremonies that violate their fundamental religious beliefs.\n \n \"But the role of marriage in many faiths extends beyond the actual marriage ceremony.\n \n \"I have examined the laws of other states, including Vermont and Connecticut, which have recently passed same-sex marriage laws. Both go further in protecting religious institutions than the current New Hampshire legislation.\n \n \"This morning, I met with House and Senate leaders, and the sponsors of this legislation, and gave them language that will provide additional protections to religious institutions.\n \n \"This new language will provide the strongest and clearest protections for religious institutions and associations, and for the individuals working with such institutions.\n It will make clear that they cannot be forced to act in ways that violate their deeply held religious principles.\n \n \"If the legislature passes this language, I will sign the same-sex marriage bill into law. If the legislature doesn't pass these provisions, I will veto it.\n \n \"We can and must treat both same-sex couples and people of certain religious traditions with respect and dignity.\n \n \"I believe this proposed language will accomplish both of these goals and I urge the legislature to pass it. \n\n Weird, str8 atheists have been civilly marrying for eons without special stipulations - Good As You:: Gay and Lesbian Activism With a Sense of Humor\n \n Meh....\n \n I personally think \"religious protection\" is much adieu over nothing, as the EXISTING first amendment adequately protects. With interracial marriage, we didn't have churches \"forced\" to perform interracial marriages they didn't want to perform.\n The same would be true of gay marriage, and I have yet to see a U.S. example disproving the protection of a church from not having to perform the gay marriage, and/or not having to allow it within their private church.\n \n But whatever...\n The legislature can easily make these changes, if the governor is accurate in saying that is all the changes amount to.\n New Hampshire could soon be state #6... emoticon_xgood",

   "\"Contrary to what marriage redefinition activists might argue, redefining marriage in New Hampshire would have serious consequences for the religious community beyond the limited protections the governor has proposed,\" said ADF Senior Legal Counsel Austin R. Nimocks. \"The governor is right to recognize the threat to religious liberty, but he underestimates the threat by a long shot. Where are the protections for business owners with religious objections to recognizing same-sex 'marriages'? Formally affiliated organizations are not the only ones who need their religious liberty protected.\"\n ...\n After reviewing the proposed language of the statute, ADF attorneys claim that religious organizations would be forced to recognize counterfeit \"marriages\" of potential clients or customers in many situations or face severe consequences. \n\n ADF: NH gov's proposed revisions to marriage redefinition bill fail religious freedom test - Alliance Defense Fund - Defending Our First Liberty\n \n And there it is...\n The repeated demand from the anti-gay for SPECIAL PRIVILEGES for the \"religious\" detractors.\n \n I fully support CHURCHES and PASTORS from being exempt, but it's not necessary.\n Currently, our RELIGIOUS discrimination protection is much stronger than our gay discrimination protection, but do you see churches being forced to perform inter-religion marriage if the church doctrine is against it? NO!\n Do you see atheists saying \"I like the look of this church. I don't belong, but I'm going to force you to rent the church for my wedding party anyways.\" ?? NO!\n \n The existing language and constitutional protections are good enough.\n But when given more explicit (redundant) wording, what do the anti-gay marriage organizations demand?\n Something NO GROUP HAS EVER HAD before.\n They want BUSINESS OWNERS to be free to discriminate if they have \"religious objections\"...\n What if their objections are NON-religious in nature? Why is the religion supposed to get the special perk???\n \n And as mentioned, NO GROUP HAS EVER HAD this.\n There were plenty of religious interpretations against black equality and interracial marriage. But did we give THEM special privilege to ignore and discriminate against interracial marriages?\n NO!\n \n The really refreshing part of all this?\n These whiny temper tantrums just don't matter... emoticon_rolleyes\n If the NH legislature includes the religious exceptions (if they are just reconfirming that churches / pastors don't have to perform ceremonies they don't want to), then the governor WILL sign it.",

They think it is right to oppress us and see can not see that we have no interest in oppressing them or even revenge for the oppression.",
