When you add in state taxes, sales taxes, \"mandatory fees\", local taxes, etc... Americans are being taxed in most cases in excess of 50% of their income. Our government has simply opted to be less up front about our taxation and its costs than some other nations.\n \n As far as the democrats being the \"party of the people\"...that is foolish. We have no party of the people in the united states. Our politicians are all pretty much special interest whores.

I DO know that the republican base is the religous right, and they have worked very hard to make that their base. I have to say kudos for a good choice on that one. After all, who is going to be more gullible than a bunch of folks who live their lives around the concept that there is an invisible man in the sky watching them? Beyond that, they routinely give relatively large sums of money to people because the invisible man in the sky wants them to. \n \n Most of the major political debates are little more than side shows. Does it really matter if we allow vegetables to die? Of course not. Is abortion somethign that rocks this nation to the core? Only if you are a nutjob. Does it really matter what kind of gun control we have? Only if you ignore every peer reviewed bit of research ever done on the subject.\n \n BUT, these are issues that people are willing to get off ther cheetos eating, survivor watching butts to vote about.

This, along with a bad disregard for our men and women in uniform are the two biggest reasons I can't in good conscience vote democrat in many instances. But yes, Republicans have their problems too.\n\n \n I would have to disagree about the democrats showing a bad disregard for our men and women in uniform. You are a major supporter of an adminsitration who has sent huge numbers of those people off to be killed in a mission that shows no net gain for the US. The absolute best result we can possibly hope for at this point is to see secular Iraq turned into another totalitarian inslamic state. What could possibly show more disregrd for our military than that? Sending a man off to die for no reason is the ultimate insult. \n \n I can tell you from grim experience that our soldiers will, while in theater and for a short time afterwards, comfort themselves with the idea that they were really helping the Iraqi people. As time goes by, that will become hollow because it is the kind of induced mindset that requires constant re enforcement. It will not take long after the constant reminders of how great their mission is start to slow that they will start wondering how great their mission could have really been, given the truckloads of civilian bodies it generated. \n \n Don't you think it is better to short circuit that entire process by ensuring that we only send our troops out on missions that have a high likelyhood of a net gain for the US? You did not see a high incident of mentall illness following WWII. There were certainly soldiers that suffered from \"shellshock\" (what we now call PTSD), but you are only talking 6-8% of the entire service. It is estimated that roughly 15% of soldiers returning from WWII could have significantly benifitted from psychological help. Contrast that to Vietnam, where over 40% of the soldiers returnign suffered from psychological disorders, in many cases so severe that they were never again able to be functional members of society. It is estimated that over 90% of vitenam returners could have significantly benifitted from psychological treatment.\n \n During WWII, you would be hard pressed to find a soldier who did not whilly support what we were doing. There was almost no dissention in the ranks, though there are no reliable numbers from which we can draw it is estimated that approval ratings ran in the 97% range regarding the war. In vietnam, we DO have accurate numbers, and approval ratings in our troops actively engaged in the war ran in excess of 98%. Despite the fact we relied on conscripts, many of whom disliked the war, we saw high approval ratings in the ranks. That is a testament to self deception if ever one existed. A soldier int eh filed cannot question the morals of his mission, he must simply accept that they are right, and if they are NOT right, he must force himself to look at them differently until they become right. \n \n Fast forward 20 years. 20 years after WWII, 100% of WWII vets surveyed said they felt that the US did the right thing in WWII and 100% claimed it was an honorable war. Of vietnam vets, only 21% felt we did the right thing by becoming involved in Vietnam and less than 10% felt it was an honorable war. \n \n This is the problem with sending guys off to fight wars like the one in Iraq. You can not maintain the lie forever. Regardles of what the public thinks, or what the soldiers think when they are in the field, if the war is not just and does not serve to provide a net gain for the US, the lies eventually fall apart. \n \n Some other confilcts that held high approval ratings with the troops both during the conflict and long after it was over include bosnia and somolia. I served with some guy who were on the ground, in combat, in somalia, and to a man they will proudly state that they were there, and that not one single civilain was killed by US forces. Despite the fact that we lost, and the fact that public approval ratings were through the floor, they were proud to have served in that conflict becuase it was honorably fought and worthwhile. \n \n I guess what I am saying here is that in determining who is supporting troops or whatever, the overriding factor is the effect on those troops 10 years down the road. The current folly is a pretty good example of disregard for our troops. Tehre is no honor in the war in Iraq. Those who have planned and orchestrated the war have opted for heavy civilian casualties in exchange for minimal bad publicity due to US deaths. There is no honor in that, and no netr gain for the US in the mission. Iraq war vets are almost certainly destined for the same problems that Vietnam war vets had. Once there is some seperation, and they are not constantly being bombarded by propoganda, they will have to come to grips with the fact that they fought a dishonorable war where tens of thousands of civilians were killed without any net gain. That is a hard row for a man to hoe, and \"orders\" is a slim consolation when confronted with the fact that you are responsible for helping to carry out mass murder.\n \n Most of the people fighting in Iraq are just kids. Many of them will have 60 or even 70 years to consider their part in the conflict. That is 60 to 70 years of sitting alone in the dark at night feeling like a mass murderer. You think the Bush admionistration cares about that? That is the ultimate disregard for our troops. Death is a kinder fate.",

None of those guys have any idea what Howard Dean said. Their correspondance and incoming information is carefully vetted. Their Email is being scanned for key words, selected media is blacked out, the works. The military maintains as close to total information control as possible for US troops in the field. Those guy see what their commanders want them to see, hear what their commanders want them to hear, and ultimatly think what their commanders want them to think. Studies show that the induced mindset will last from 2-5 years after the military looses the ability ot filter the information. \n \n This is in large part why the only folks you see going on about supporting the troops by supportng a lie is civilians with no clue what they are talking about. Guys like McCain, who served in combat, know better. Even if every person in America stood up at once, spit in the eye of a US soldier, and called them murderers to their faces, it would not matter. Those soldier will believe what they are told to believe. They will believe it becuase they WANT to believe it. They WANT to believe that they are more than cannon fodder fighting a cowardly, dishonorable, illegal war. They HAVE to believe it in order to function.

Each situation has to be argued and decided on it's own merits. The real problem is the level of support the military is given during conflict. The recent demoralizing comments by Howard Dean are one such example. And let's face it, if not for Bush and the Republican congress' reforms in this area, career men and women in uniform would still be making poverty-level income.\n\n \n I don't care what the troops think. They all volunteered for military service, in most cases because the pay, benefits and educational opportunities now far exceed most anything available in the private sector for a high school graduate with poor math and reading skills. They're waging war against civilians under foreign policy which I, a majority of Americans and the world, emphatically disagree with or facing prison for non-performance. They're doing the job they chose, nothing else. \n \n Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, Independent or Homer Simpson, to generate a level of military appreciation approaching that of WW2 for troops serving in Iraq is an absolutely ridiculous statement. They certainly aren't defending my country.",

   "Their correspondance and incoming information is carefully vetted. Their Email is being scanned for key words, selected media is blacked out, the works. The military maintains as close to total information control as possible for US troops in the field. Those guy see what their commanders want them to see, hear what their commanders want them to hear, and ultimatly think what their commanders want them to think. Studies show that the induced mindset will last from 2-5 years after the military looses the ability ot filter the information. \n\n \n Do you not realize that most of our men and women in uniform don't need any induced mindset to feel they are doing the right thing? The problem is that YOU and others with your mindset think they aren't. Not that they do or don't. \n \n \nThey will believe it becuase they WANT to believe it. They WANT to believe that they are more than cannon fodder fighting a cowardly, dishonorable, illegal war.\n\n \n I have news for you . . . they aren't the only ones who believe it. You've convinced yourself of something that's completely up in the air and for which the jury is still out--as far as I'm concerned and many others, they're doing the right thing, and I'm going to do all I can to make sure they know it. It's an honorable war, and could care less if it's \"illegal\" by some invalid and only-on-paper worldwide legal system. It wasn't a wise course of action, on that we can agree. But it's not dishonorable. Stop letting the anti-war industry do your thinking for you and come back to reality. This ain't Vietnam. Disagree with U.S. policy if you want--but good grief, stop acting like it's the end of life on earth as we know it or something. \n \n Some of us think freedom is worth it. I truily believe that in large part the real difference between a lot of anti-war people and those who DO support this conflict is that those who don't have forgotten or abandoned the realization that freedom is VERY costly and takes a long time to achieve. In our want-results-now world, people are presumptuously thinking that war is a failure if we hit any serious opposition or it takes any significant amount of time. Imagine if the north threw their hands up in the air after 2 years in 1863 and said \"it's not worth it!! Pull out of the south!\" Or if the colonials threw their hand up and gave up when things looked hard in the revolutionary war. \n \n I also think that part of the problem in this conflict is that the Gulf War changed people's expectations about war. It was quick and there was negligible body count in U.S. troops. Much of it was decided by air power. People have forgotten that conflicts for freedom often take time and sacrifice. \n \n \nand that most combat vets from other conflicts view them as cowardly trash \n\n \n You are in another world, man.

   "Then you agree with me. Our soldiers SHOULD shoot back even if it's a kid.\n\n \n That has nevre been an issue. No US soldier has ever been court martialed or otherwise diciplined for shooting an enemy combatant, regardless of age.\n \n \n \n \nI think you have a very black and white view of the situation. This idea that there are only the insurgents that are dangerous and all those houses and buildings belong to the \"good folks\" is a very unrealistic assessment of the situation. In a place like Fallujah, the insurgency is ingrained into the populace. The whole friggin' town was mostly an insurgency. I hate that children were hit too, but when an insurgency leaves kids in harm's way, and puts them into the heart of their hideout, the responsibility in large part is on the insurgency. \n\n \n This has been thoroughly debunked. 250,000 people in Falluja, 3000 militants, and we leveled the place. Casualties are estimated in excess of 10,000. Even if we killed every insurgent int eh city (which we know we did not), that is still 7000 dead civilians and a city laid to waste because we bombd the XXXX out of it instead of sending in our forces to fight a foot battle. bombs are indescriminate killers. A man with a rifle is not.\n \n \n \nI think you are not only looking at the situation through the eyes of the way YOU see the war, you are expecting soldiers to only see it your way. And you are placing impossible expectations on the soldiers as well if you expect them to automatically only see your side of this as the correct one, throw down their arms in masse, and mutiny. The reason they haven't isn't because they are afraid of what might happen to them, it's because they haven't bought into your view of the war. They know it's not immoral, that freedom doesn't come cheap, and that it takes time.\n\n \n Or because they don't want to end up in a federal prison, and the TIA campaign is going well (the militaries in house propoganda campaign). \n \n If you are correct, thent he days of there being any honor in being a soldier are gone and we are sunk anyway.",

Perhaps our definitions of middle class differ, there now being lower, middle and upper middle class people in that socioeconomic grouping. In most cases the upper end of middle class signifies advanced education and if a desire for military service is present, unusual unless a family profession, it consists of a commission after undergrad school or attendance at one of the military colleges by political invitation. Lower and middle middle classes might provide cannon fodder, but that sounds more like emotion from parental influence (Semper Fi and such) or poor high school grades.

While this index is all good and well, I wouldn`t take it as ultimate authority on the issue. There are too many subjective factors and the weighting of various factors make the whole index rather subjective. It`s an indication of something rather unmeasurable, \"quality of life\". Here is a list of all factors considered: http://www.undp.org/hdr2003/indicator/index_indicators.html\n \n As you can see from the list, it`s an ambitous project.\n \n To contrast the report I would also like to cite gdp/capita figures. While these are just as flawed measurment as the HDI (if not more so) they are at least tangiable. \n \n GDP/capita, ppp adjusted\n USA: 40,100\n Norway: 40,000\n Sweden: 28,400 \n \n Source: http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html\n \n As you can see, Norway and the US are pretty close in this regard, while Sweden is trailing behind rather considerably (even though ppp adjusted gdp figures gives a biased picture in this case). When it comes to living standards as in material wealth, US is still the top-dog (apart from luxemburg, but that`s not really a country :p ).\n \n When measuring GNI per capita (gross national income), the picture looks a bit different:\n \n Norway: 52 030 \n USA: 41 400\n Sweden: 35 770\n \n With norway on top and Sweden is considerably closer to the US than in the GDP/capita measures. But these figures are not adjusted for international purchasing power.\n \n All in all, I still claim that the US is the wealthiest nation on this planet (apart from Luxemburg). If standard of living is a measurment of material wellfare of the citizenry, I think the favour is still with the US. If standard of living is some way of trying to gauge \"quality of life\", Sweden and Norway looks rather nice*. How this will develop in the future is another question though.\n \n * (even though I must say that the first bloody idiot who thought that migrating to scandinavia would be a good idea in the first place ought to be severely punished. Do you have any idea of how cold it gets up here? Not to mention dark. We got about 4 hours of sunlight at the moment... No wonder our national sport is suicide. I`m sick of it. I need a vaccation to a sunny place.)\n \n Oh, and as for the polarization of society, this could indeed be a serious problem in the US in the future. The middle class is what guarantees democracy as well as economic prosperity. Remove the middle class, and you`ll end up with a dual-society. Just like in Africa.

   "I would have to disagree about the democrats showing a bad disregard for our men and women in uniform. You are a major supporter of an adminsitration who has sent huge numbers of those people off to be killed in a mission that shows no net gain for the US. The absolute best result we can possibly hope for at this point is to see secular Iraq turned into another totalitarian inslamic state. What could possibly show more disregrd for our military than that? Sending a man off to die for no reason is the ultimate insult. \n \n I can tell you from grim experience that our soldiers will, while in theater and for a short time afterwards, comfort themselves with the idea that they were really helping the Iraqi people. As time goes by, that will become hollow because it is the kind of induced mindset that requires constant re enforcement. It will not take long after the constant reminders of how great their mission is start to slow that they will start wondering how great their mission could have really been, given the truckloads of civilian bodies it generated. \n \n Don't you think it is better to short circuit that entire process by ensuring that we only send our troops out on missions that have a high likelyhood of a net gain for the US? You did not see a high incident of mentall illness following WWII. There were certainly soldiers that suffered from \"shellshock\" (what we now call PTSD), but you are only talking 6-8% of the entire service. It is estimated that roughly 15% of soldiers returning from WWII could have significantly benifitted from psychological help. Contrast that to Vietnam, where over 40% of the soldiers returnign suffered from psychological disorders, in many cases so severe that they were never again able to be functional members of society. It is estimated that over 90% of vitenam returners could have significantly benifitted from psychological treatment.\n \n During WWII, you would be hard pressed to find a soldier who did not whilly support what we were doing. There was almost no dissention in the ranks, though there are no reliable numbers from which we can draw it is estimated that approval ratings ran in the 97% range regarding the war. In vietnam, we DO have accurate numbers, and approval ratings in our troops actively engaged in the war ran in excess of 98%. Despite the fact we relied on conscripts, many of whom disliked the war, we saw high approval ratings in the ranks. That is a testament to self deception if ever one existed. A soldier int eh filed cannot question the morals of his mission, he must simply accept that they are right, and if they are NOT right, he must force himself to look at them differently until they become right. \n \n Fast forward 20 years. 20 years after WWII, 100% of WWII vets surveyed said they felt that the US did the right thing in WWII and 100% claimed it was an honorable war. Of vietnam vets, only 21% felt we did the right thing by becoming involved in Vietnam and less than 10% felt it was an honorable war. \n \n This is the problem with sending guys off to fight wars like the one in Iraq. You can not maintain the lie forever. Regardles of what the public thinks, or what the soldiers think when they are in the field, if the war is not just and does not serve to provide a net gain for the US, the lies eventually fall apart. \n \n Some other confilcts that held high approval ratings with the troops both during the conflict and long after it was over include bosnia and somolia. I served with some guy who were on the ground, in combat, in somalia, and to a man they will proudly state that they were there, and that not one single civilain was killed by US forces. Despite the fact that we lost, and the fact that public approval ratings were through the floor, they were proud to have served in that conflict becuase it was honorably fought and worthwhile. \n \n I guess what I am saying here is that in determining who is supporting troops or whatever, the overriding factor is the effect on those troops 10 years down the road. The current folly is a pretty good example of disregard for our troops. Tehre is no honor in the war in Iraq. Those who have planned and orchestrated the war have opted for heavy civilian casualties in exchange for minimal bad publicity due to US deaths. There is no honor in that, and no netr gain for the US in the mission. Iraq war vets are almost certainly destined for the same problems that Vietnam war vets had. Once there is some seperation, and they are not constantly being bombarded by propoganda, they will have to come to grips with the fact that they fought a dishonorable war where tens of thousands of civilians were killed without any net gain. That is a hard row for a man to hoe, and \"orders\" is a slim consolation when confronted with the fact that you are responsible for helping to carry out mass murder.\n \n Most of the people fighting in Iraq are just kids. Many of them will have 60 or even 70 years to consider their part in the conflict. That is 60 to 70 years of sitting alone in the dark at night feeling like a mass murderer. You think the Bush admionistration cares about that? That is the ultimate disregard for our troops. Death is a kinder fate.\nDamn! For a minute there I thought you were talking about JFK and LBJ...asking our troops to fight with one hand!\n \n Unlike that Democrats political war, the Republican ME wars were of a kickass sort...and we won each of them with far fewer than 58,000 dead soldiers. When we escaped from Siagon in the end, the only thing that had changed significantly was the date. Many a mortitian profited greatly from the Vietnam War.\n \n The thread title is correct. Democrats are not the party of the people. They are the party of the professional politicians...hellbent on staying in power and smearing the Republicans when they take a turn in the Oval Office, regardless of what's really good for the country.\n \n Democrats must be literally sick and desparate now that they have NO MAJORITY ANYWHERE IN OUR GOVERNMENT!

I dunno, i didn't read the rest of this thread :)\n\n \n I`ve done some digging, and found some illustrative figures. These are from the early nineties, and things have changed since then. But I`m fairly certain the general outlines are still valid\n \n Wage disparity, ratio of in OECD countries (Source: OECD 1993)\n \n USA: 5,55 (1989)\n Canada: 4,40 (1990)\n Austria: 3,55 (1989)\n France: 3,20 (1991)\n Portugal: 2,69 (1989)\n Germany: 2,52 (1990)\n Netherlands: 2,31 (1990)\n Belgium: 2,30 (1990)\n Australia: 2,27 (1991)\n Denmark: 2,15 (1990)\n Sweden: 2,08 (1991)\n Norway: 1,97 (1991)\n \n What these figures show is 90/10 quota, that is, how many times more the average wage of the richest 10% is to the average wage of the poorest 90%.\n \n That means that in the US, the average wage for the richest 10% is 5,55 times the average wage for the rest of the country. In Sweden, the equivalent number is 2,08.\n \n And since this is related to wage, rather than income, this has nothing to do with taxes, but the wage structure (ie, unions, economic culture, supply and demand for labour, productivity, wage setting process etc) \n \n An interesting aspect of this is the difference between Europe and the US (and Canada). It is obvious that the US wage disparity is significantly higher. Apparantly, there has been some rather interesting changes in the last few decades. In many countries in Europe, the wage dispairity shrank during the 60-ies,70-ies, and 80-ies while starting to increase again during the nineties, an increase that stagnated during the first years in 2000. In the US, the wage disparity shrank during the 60-ies, but started to increase again as early as the 70-ies, an increase that continued throughout the 80-ies and 90-ies. The same is true for Brittain (wonder if Tatchers polycies towards the labour unions had anything to do with this)...\n \n Oh, and keep in mind that this is wages, not income derived from capital investments or savings. If these where included, no doubt the inequality would be even more pronounced. How it would differ between nations, I cannot say for certain, but since wealth distribution is the key to distribution of incomes derived from wealth, I would be extreamly surprised if it would be in the US favour.",

Why is the average wage of the richest 10% in America 5.5 times the average for the rest of the country, while in Sweden the equivalent number is only 2.08 ?\n \n Although you don't include any numbers for Finland, I suggest that the Scandinavian people's concept of \"social justice\" is at the root of their intolerance of very large disparities in earnings. The economic culture, which you refer to in Sweden and Norway, is thoroughly permeated with the ethos of social democracy. Nordic people focus on collective ends rather than on individual economic freedoms, and are prepared to buy a \"fairer\" society by paying the price of high taxation.\n \n In the United States, the economic culture is almost an exact opposite to what I've briefly described, or if you prefer, at the other end of the spectrum.",

Our politicians communicate with counties of similar size and report that conditions are worse in other counties and better in some, with the state accumulation projected for insolvency on teacher retirement/benefits (shared in a state fund) in 14-years.\n \n I know Sweden went through much the same scenario in the 1990s resulting in some drastic austerity programs, and am wondering what finally triggered the change.\n\n \n What you seem to describe here is what I would say is the worst of both worlds. You seem to have a centralised control of the labour supply (a national union) that can and will act with force (as in strikes) if their demands are not met. But at the same time, you have business-specific negotiations that does not consider the effects of their actions on the national economy. \n \n This is quite similiar to what we experienced in the eighties (leading up to the crash). Our national unions where still strong enough to force massive wage increases but the centralised aspects of the actual wage negotations had broken down and business-specific negotiations where the norm*. Despite attempts of our governments to mediate the wage demands of the labour unions, the individual unions became comitted to increase their wages at the expence of other unions. This aggregated and even triggered inflation as this development concerned the entire private and public sectors. In your case, it sounds like it only concerns the municipal sector and would therefor lead to increased public expenditures. \n \n While this is certainly serious and could very well lead to raised taxes to cover the future pensions or pehaps a revamp of the entire system (you need to reform your pension system anyway with an aging population crisis just a few corners away), I don`t think it will have the same disastrous efffect on the national economy. \n \n Our problem was that the spiraling wage demands led to increased inflation, something we could not afford in the long run due to our fixed currency. When capital transfers where liberalised, speculative attacks, based on market expectations of inflation and possible future devaluation led to a dramatic crash. \n \n \n * With centralised authority, the labour unions where previously forced to consider the effects of their wage demands on the national economy (as in wage-inflation spirals, unemployment etc.)",

   "Our concerns are twofold; unionized public service driving demands on what is a finite tax base (stagnant service economy) and subsequent reduction of primary social services to meet those demands. The unions are essentially reducing their work force, which creates public animosity directed at elected leadership, while generating future, unmanageable obligations. \n \n Some steps are being taken to remedy retirement benefits to reasonable levels, but union strength has reached a point where any disturbance of active and retired membership benefits bring immediate threats of strikes. The current solution is directed at dual work forces, union and non-union, to dilute union strength and reduce expenses (no shortage of workers even at reduced wages/benefits befitting local economies) but that excludes existing work forces and the largest and most demanding segment, the teachers union. We're now closing schools, expanding class sizes, curtailing extra-curricular activities and diluting quality of education, a slow death of progress for any nation.

To answer your question, the general public supports teachers. Few comprehend future financial and loss of social services ramifications as our schools, like the television, are primary babysitters for working parents. Personal inconvenience for child care without school would be, to their way of thinking, unmanageable for most families. \n \n On that same note, support for other civil services such as police, street maintenance, etc. is also high due to the convenience factor, nothing else. Our politicians are well aware that even the slightest public inconvenience, much less a strike, brings normally apathetic voters to the polls to oust them in favor of replacement with complaint office holders who will cater to public desires, not needs. \n \n One direction being taken in many areas is to remove elected officials as purse holders, relying on 'professional' managers under contract for financial responsibility.
