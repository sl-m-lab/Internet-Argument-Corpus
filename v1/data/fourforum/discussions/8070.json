Hillary Clinton had been notified by phone and had instructed the hospital staff that Clinton's personal physician would be arriving soon.\n \n When Mrs. Clinton arrived, she told both of the resident physicians on duty that night that they would never again practice medicine in the United States if word leaked out about Clinton's drug problem. Reportedly, she pinned one of the doctors up against the wall, both hands pressed against his shoulders, as she gave her dire warning.\n \n Like most tales that reflect poorly on Bill Clinton, the press has ignored any inquiry into this one. In 1996, however, columnist R. Emmett Tyrrell located and telephoned one of the nurses who had been on duty the night Bill Clinton was brought into the emergency room. According to Tyrrell, the nurse didn't deny the story, but said she couldn't talk about it because she could lose her job.
