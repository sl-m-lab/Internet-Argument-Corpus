   "Angel Chandler and her partner of nine years are not allowed to sleep in the same house because a Tennessee judge has deemed their relationship sinful and the only way Chandler can retain custody of her daughter is for the two women to maintain separate households. ACLU's Matt Coles provides the backstory: Angel Chandler and Joseph Baker divorced ten years ago. They had two children, a daughter, now 13 and a son, now 15. They had joint custody and visitation with both children. Ms. Chandler began seeing the woman who became her partner nine years ago, and Mr. Baker married the woman who is now his wife in 2003. Earlier this year, Ms. Chandler and Mr. Baker went to family court to get approval for a modification of their parenting plan. Following usual procedure, the court ordered an evaluation of both homes. The evaluation said that Ms. Chandler's partner was a positive influence, and had a parent-like relationship with both of the children.\n \n Well, it turns out that evaluation wasn't good enough for his holiness George Robert Ellis of Tennessee's 28th Judicial District, who invoked the states antiquated \"paramour law\" to force the two women to live apart. (And Chandler's ex-husband hadn't even asked for the restriction!) Now Chandler is appealing Ellis's decision with the help of ACLU attorneys. A brief has been filed with Jackson's Court of Appeals to overturn the ruling. Angel Chandler says that the judge's forced separation been disruptive to her family: \"We lived together in a stable, functioning family, and this was rather shocking to all of us. This is about the person we choose to be with, not about what my ex-husband asked for or what's in the best interest of the children. The judge decided to interfere, and it's had a very negative affect in our lives.\" \n \n Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the ACLU of Tennessee, writes: \"Unfortunately, this case is an all-too-familiar example of how unfairly lesbian and gay parents are treated in custody and visitation proceedings. All the children's health and welfare organizations have long recognized that lesbian and gay parents are just as capable of being good parents as straight couples, and their children are just as well adjusted.\"\n \n Defenders of the paramour law are quick to point out that the restrictions also apply to unwed heterosexuals. (Which is true, even though those cases are not as aggressively enforced.) But then straight couples have an option that's not available to Chandler and her partner. They can get married. The Progressive Puppy: Judge to lesbian mom: No cohabitation, or lose your child.\n \n I think this is the new \"Jim Crow\" approach that was utilized to institute anti-black bigotry into the law, when the constitution, court rulings, and legislation made it plain that anti-black bigotry was not tolerated.\n Arkansas is an example where this approach was used to circumvent the law. The fact that the legislated ballot initiative was predominantly known by its intended effect upon gay adoption is proof in and of itself...\n \n One constitutional application test of the 14th amendment is to verify that the standard is APPLIED UNILATERALLY to all cases where it applies. When the law is selectively applied to just gays, who make up a fraction of the society, it will be proof that the law is applied unconstitutionally.\n \n Going a step further, it can also be examined based on the \"principle\" it attempts to espouse. Saying that the parent doesn't have a right to cohabitate and pursue such an introduction into a relationship that could lead into marriage? Ridiculously restrictive without any true purpose behind it.",
