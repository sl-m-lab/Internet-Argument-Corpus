The only thing that has happened is that Americans now have to pay more for their imports which they still seem to be buying at the same rate as before.\n\n \n The theory there (and it is a sound one) is that a low value for your currency will help eliminate on hand stocks. This is why nations push for an undervalued currency. There is one hell of a difference between an \"undervalued\" currency and a worhtless one. Currrently, the yuan is undervalued. The peso is worthless. Which coutnry do you think is in better shape economically, China, or Mexico?\n \n \nBut thankfully we can always count of the Fed to sooth our collective minds and keep the stock market afloat with its words of 'wisdom' and outright feces of a male cow:\n\n \n This seems to be their new policy. When bad numbers come out, they make an immediate postive statement. Truth in the statement is secondary to getting the desired effect in the market. \n \n Bad NFP numbers? No problem, get Greenspan to get up there and say something positive about the fact the dollar is falling in the toilet. bad deficit numbers? No a problem, get one of the governers to jump up and talk about how committed washington is to lowering the deficit, despite the fact that this year it is projected to be higher than last, and there is no realistic plan in place to decrease it. \n \n I watch the forex markets closely, and I have noticed since the beginning of the year that EVERY SINGLE time bad economic numbers come out, the FED pops their head up the same day with a positive statement, even though that positive statement is generally a lie. It generally reverses the downward pressure ont he dollar in the short trerm (a day or 2) while amateur traders act on the comments from the fed, but there is almost always a correction later (next couple of days) as more experienced traders move on informaiton that is actually correct, as opposed to being formulated simply to appease the public. \n \n Now that this cycle is fairly well established, we can acty on it, and once again use the gullibility of the american public to take even more of their hard earned money! Horray for capitolism! Horray for dishonest politicians! Horray for a fed that is little more than a political pawn!!!\n \n Now, instead of just positioning for the dive that we know will come with the bad news, we can position ourselves for that dive, then the \"recovery\" that comes with the feds remarks, secure in the knowledge that in the end, less gullible heads will prevail and things will end up as they should be.
