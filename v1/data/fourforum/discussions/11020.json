Well, no, she hasn't. She said in the debate last week that she would work on it. I guess it's a really, really big job. Let's see. What would it entail? Calling one's accountant, or perhaps directing one's aide to call one's accountant and say, \"Please provide a copy of my tax return from last year to the press\". Or maybe she communicates with her tax accountant in some other manner that requires more \"work\", smokes signals or mental telepathy perhaps? ;) \n \n But waiting until April is not customary. In the 2004 Democratic primary, Governor Dean, Rep. Kucinich, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Edwards released their tax returns in April of 2003 - a full year earlier in the primary process. Senator Kerry released his tax returns in December of 2003, and General Clark released his tax returns in January of 2004. \n \n Senator Clinton's refusal to make this very basic disclosure has raised a number of eyebrows among advocates for increased transparency. As her top Ohio supporter Governor Ted Strickland said in his 2006 campaign, if a candidate is not releasing his or her \"tax return, what is he hiding? We should question what's going on.\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/02/29/717817.aspx",

   "Turns out the only candidate refusing to release tax information is the Republican. \n \n --------------\n \n April 18, 2008, 12:36 pm\n McCain's Tax Returns\n By BARRY MEIER\n Updated | 12:59 p.m. Senator John McCain released his income tax returns for the past two years showing that he received over $740,000 during 2006 and 2007 from his Senate salary, book royalty payments, his military pension and Social Security.\n \n But yesterday's release did not shed new light on the extent of the presumptive Republican presidential candidate's wealth which comes from his wife, Cindy McCain.\n \n Mrs. McCain holds a significant stake in a Phoenix-based beer distributorship, Hensley & Co. that her late father helped found. To date, she has not disclosed the size of her stake in the privately-held concern. But published estimates have speculated that it could be worth up to $100 million or more.\n \n Hensley or entities controlled by it also have sizable real estate holdings, primarily in Arizona, public filings show.\n \n In a statement accompanying the release of Senator McCain's taxes, his campaign stated that it was not releasing Mrs. McCain's personal taxes \"in the interest of protecting the privacy of her children\".\n \n According to filings, Mrs. McCain received an annual salary of over $430,000 for serving as chairwoman of the company, which one of the country's biggest distributors of Anheuser-Busch products. Under a prenuptial agreement, Cindy McCain's assets are kept separate from her husband's.\n \n According to Senator McCain's tax filing, he paid a total $157,231 in taxes on taxable income during the two-year period, a tax rate of about 33 percent, according to his campaign.\n \n Over the past two years, Senator and Mrs. McCain donated about $340,320 from their community assets to charity, the campaign said.\n \n Most of Senator McCain's contributions were made to the John and Cindy McCain Family Foundation. It contributes to a number of groups including Operation Smile, an organization that provide reconstructive facial surgery to poor children and others, and The Halo Trust, an organization involved in mine-clearing.\n \n Mr. McCain's Democratic rivals released their tax information recently. Senator Barack Obama released his 2007 return on Wednesday. Last month, the Obamas' tax returns from 2000 to 2006 were posted on the campaign Web site. Mrs. Clinton followed suit on April 4. [links provided at website]\n \n http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/mccains-tax-returns/\n \n -----------\n \n Can McCain be trusted? At all?\n \n I suppose the information contained in those papers would be embarassing to John and Cindy. That's why they keep them under wraps.\n \n Eat your own words, Closet Pubbies.\n emoticon_hb",
