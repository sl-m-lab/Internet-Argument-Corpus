   "How mush times will Europe trigger at backlash in attempting to hols sway over former Soviet Union area? We can't understand the main idea of it - they (former communist states in post-soviet space) are too different from us. Look, even we will teach good democratic ways some person there still he'll be different and prone to stealing, deceiving and cumshaw!
