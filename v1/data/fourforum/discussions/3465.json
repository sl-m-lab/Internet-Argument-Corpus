   "\"I trust God speaks through me. Without that, I couldn't do my job.\" Spoken by President Bush, as quoted in the Lancaster New Era.\n \n If you think that's scary read on: \"God told me to strike at al Qaeda and I struck them, and then he instructed me to strike Saddam, which I did, and now I am determined to solve the problem in the Middle East. If you help me, I will act, and if not, the elections will come and I will have to focus on them.\" Spoken by George Bush in a meeting with Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas.\n \n But wait, there's more. \"We're going to save every American, one soul at a time.\" President Bush speaking to the National Urban League in July: \"God loves you and I love you. And you can count on both of us as a powerful message that people who wonder about their future can hear.\"\n \n Some of you might say, \"right on, way to go.\" I just pray that there are those of you who will be as shocked and afraid as I was reading this.\n \n http://www.spokesmanreview.com/news/letters.asp?date=080404&id=l21143",

For example, would it really kill you not to say God bless America at the end of a speech? You can say it if you want, but you shouldn't be in office using the belief that God blesses America. You can believe that, but it shouldn't influence your politics. But of course the other side can't attack the religious people for fear of losing even more votes of the Christian majority.",
