   "Hi all,\n \n I decided to start a thread to see what folks had to say about fossilization.\n \n I'll start by saying that, as I understand it, death is certain and fossilization of the remains is highly uncommon. An animal or plant dies and immediately scavengers, animals plants and bacteria, start the process of reclaiming materials from the carcass. There is very little chance of any part of the organism to be left to fossilize. Unless the carcass was relatively quickly protected from scavenger organisms, there is hardly any chance it will form a fossil. So, maybe most fossils we see are the result of a tragic, untimely death.\n \n Is this evidence for the flood?\n \n Then, there are various fossilization mechanisms. I couldn't find any good information about the rates of said mechanisms, so I thought this thread might start some good debate on the subject because of that. \n \n Now, how long did the fossilization take? Did it take 10 or 10,000 or 10,000,000 years?\n \n Are the fossils we see all the result of one big 'tragic' event for all, or little 'tragic' events for each?\n \n Any thoughts?\n \n \n emoticon_xangel",

Unless the carcass was relatively quickly protected from scavenger organisms, there is hardly any chance it will form a fossil. So, maybe most fossils we see are the result of a tragic, untimely death.\n \n Is this evidence for the flood?\n\n \n Well by the Flood, I assume you are refering to the description given in Genesis?\n \n Fossils we find today have been attributed to a remarkable variety of environmental settings that allowed them to be preserved. Also, you seem to be refering to the preservation of large animals such as terrestrial vertebrates, which are far rarer than fossils of marine organisms with calcarous skeletons. In that regard, some types of rock are basically one huge fossil as most of their composition is derived from dead animal material.\n \n There are just so many different types in which creatures are preserved it is not possible to consider the events within the context of a word like \"tragic\" Unusual? sometimes. In some cases the word inevitable is the most apt.\n \n Also, there are quite a few numbers of ways in which animals have been preserved without the direct involvement of water/sedimentation- terrestrial invertebrates trapped in amber, tarpit \"traps\" like those of the famous Rancho la Brea with remarkable preservations of ice-age mammal fauna and mummified animals from desert environments (off the top of my head). Plus then you have a whole set of fossils preserved in water conditions where there has been very slow, low energy deposition of sediments, like black shales and the Lithographic limestones of Solnhofen.\n \n \nThen, there are various fossilization mechanisms. I couldn't find any good information about the rates of said mechanisms, so I thought this thread might start some good debate on the subject because of that. \n \n Now, how long did the fossilization take?

Alternatively click the link in my sig and look in the archive section at Talk Origins.\n \n It is not possible to break fossilisation down into such simple notions as \"one big preservation event\" and lots of \"little preservations\". If you can think of some examples of fossils then we can examine them more specifically as what can be said about the circumstances of their preservation.\n \n I've been a bit vague here as it is a) such a broad subject to describe succinctly emoticon_wow b) I'm tired emoticon_zzzz and c) I'm full of cold emoticon_frazzled\n \n No doubt someone who isn't under the influence of b) and/or c) will chime in as well with more details while I pull round. \n \n Now, where was my hankerchief......emoticon_xclown",

   "emoticon_xbouncer \n man, this board has great smileys\n \n i did google all kinds of ways to try to get some answers about how long the different fossilization mechanisms take, etc. that's why i thought this was a good place to pose the question\n \n you can get all the info about the actual mechanisms themselves, no problem, but i haven't come across a webpage that talks about their rates. surely they differ depending on the situation that the fossil is in, etc. but there must be some ballpark, or at least a trend to follow, i just can't seem to find the info by google\n \n and yes, i understand about flies trapped in amber (after all aren't we all? -vonnegut) \n \n i should have typed what i meant. I meant all the larger terrestrial stuff, like reptiles and trees, etc. since they would have had the most dramatic experience during the flood (of course the gensis one, at least on this board)\n \n emoticon_xgood",

   "As I have come to understand it, it depends on many variable conditions. For example, Otzi the iceman is not fossilized but mummified, and he's been there for 5300 to 5500 years. That is also true of most of the mammoth remains from the arctic - the ones that Hovind likes to claim were flash frozen - except that they have been there even longer than Otzi in most cases - some as old as 50,000 years.\n \n OccamsRazor mentioned the Solnhofen deposits that are some 140 to 170 million years old. These were lagoons that had a high saline concentration and anoxic conditions on the bottom. Thus, scavengers weren't able to feed on dead organisms on the bottom.\n \n Of course, trace fossils aren't fossils in the sense that most people would assume. They are traces in mud and sand of the passage of a living organism. Some remarkable examples are the Laetoli prints of a bipedal hominid - they are some 3.6 million years old. The Paluxy tracks of several dinosaurs that are some 113 million years old. And the coconino trace fossils laid down in the sands of a desert (in the wall of the Grand Canyon) are some 280 million years old.\n \n But a fossil is normally the cast of a bone in which all organic material has been replaced by mineral. The time can vary depending on how much water is percolating through the stratum.\n \n Perhaps when OccamsRazor has recovered from his cold (if you treat it it will go away in about 7 days - if you do nothing, it will take about a week) he will be more inclined to offer some remarks on a broad subject.",

   "I'm lucky enough to live about an hour from one of the richest deposits of large vertebrate fossils in the world, in fact, it's a UN World Heritage Site.\n \n Dinosaur Provincial Park in Drumheller Alberta. Search for the Royal Tyrell Museum, or better yet, GO THERE. It's an incredible way to spend a day, or even a weekend.\n \n As a geology student I was blessed with permission to go into areas of the park that are off limits to the general public. In some areas, it's literally hard to walk more than a few steps without tripping on some sort of fossilized bone. There are so many fossils, that they don't even bother picking them up anymore unless they are unique.\n \n It's really hard for me to present to you a succinct description of the geography and environment of the time of emplacement of these fossils. It's incredibly complex. If you want details, do a search on the Late Cretaceous Belly River Formation of southern Alberta Canada. \n \n Basically the scenario is this - you have large river valleys in a near coastal environment. The area was located near the equator, and as a result had large amounts of precipitation, think monsoons. Combine this with uplift of the Rocky Mountains and surrounding land, and you have large rates of erosion and sedimentation. As the rivers were likely the focus of life (I'm sure you've seen the National Geographic shows on the Nile or other African rivers) there is likely an increased population of animals. Combined with rapid sedimentation rates, the formula is in place to preserve dead animals for fossilization.\n \n Simply put, animal dies along river bank, river sedimentation quickly buries said animal, the fossilization process begins. It's a long odds process. Just imagine what the chances are of this happening along any river bank today.\n \n Unfortunately, it's not even that simple. The bones must now be preserved and lithified ie: turned to rock or fossilized. Another process that has somewhat long odds.\n \n On top of that, these sedimentary rock formations have to outcrop - ie, be exposed at the surface, so that we can examine them.\n \n The odds of any creature being fossilized and recovered are WAY worse than the odds of winning the lottery about 5 times in a row I'd say.\n \n I know what you're really after is timing of said event. It's hard to say exactly, and I think that's why you're having a hard time nailing it down. The lithification of bone, basically the replacing of the calcium phosphate with silica minerals, takes a long time and rather specific conditions of pressure, temperature, and fluid composition. There are so many factors that affect the fossilization and lithification rates of deposited sediments that it's nearly impossible to give you an exact answer. If I was forced, off the top of my head, I would ball park it at a bare minimum of a 100,000 years under ideal conditions, but we're more likely dealing in millions. Geological processes just aren't quick about doing anything.\n \n If you've got any specific questions, I'd be happy to answer them, obviously this is an area of interest for me.\n \n Waxy",

Do we find remains that haven't yet fully been turned to stone? or do we ever find fossils that we know must have died less than 100,000 years ago? \n \n In what state do we find all the homo skeletons? surely the australo...s are old enough to have fossilized, but what about the cro magnons and neandertals? are they still bone, have they started fossilization and are somwhere in between, or are they fully fossilized?\n \n I know these are a lot of questions, and I should take the time to go look all this stuff up, but it's always so nice when someone just knows the stuff already.\n \n Also, I'll confess I was hoping a creationist would jump in here and address some of this. I'd really like to hear that perspective.\n \n \n \n :)",
