If someone truely supports the war in Iraq and they believe it protects our freedoms then shouldn't that person not hide behind others but go themselves and put their butts on the line?

   "Retired Lt. Gen. Roberto Sanchez, the commander of coalition forces in Iraq the year after the fall of Saddam Hussein, is a wounded soldier, scarred not by bombs or bullets, but by a media he distrusts and an administration he thinks is disgusting.\n \n In a speech to military reporters and editors earlier this month, he lashed out at both. As the military leader in charge, Sanchez was the designated purveyor of optimistic propaganda for the war. Relieved of his command in June 2004 and retired in 2006, he's now a scathing critic.\n \n A soldier's job, he says, is to carry out orders. Now that he's retired, he sees his job differently: to tell the truth as he sees it. His truth provided fodder for a spectrum of opinions, but as his truth was filtered through the media and spinmasters, a critical message got lost.\n \n Sanchez began by lecturing to the media, which he accused of straying from its ethical standards and doing a disservice to the U.S. with unscrupulous reporting focused on an agenda of sensationalistic value to advance the quest of getting on the front page.\n \n Then he tore into the Bush administration for a \"catastrophically flawed, unrealistically optimistic war plan.\" He called the \"surge\" strategy a \"desperate attempt by an administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war. ...\"\n \n \"There has been a glaring, unfortunate, display of incompetent strategic leadership within our national leaders,\" he said. The National Security Council was a \"catastrophic failure.\" Partisanship and lust for power corrupted the war effort. And Congress failed to provide focused oversight.\n \n \"Who will demand accountability for the failure of our national political leaders involved in the management of this war? They have unquestionably been derelict in the performance of their duty. In my profession, these types of leaders would immediately be relieved or court-martialed.\"",
