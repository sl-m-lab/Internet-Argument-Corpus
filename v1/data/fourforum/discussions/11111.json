   "I've started dropping cash into (Australian) stocks at the beginning of this week, a bit of good value blue chip, a bit of carefully selected small cap stocks. Seems to me the right time to buy, the threat is inflation so holding cash certainly is the worst possible alternative. I won't claim to say it has \"hit bottom\", but either way, if you consistently put a bit of cash in each month, you'll either catch it on the way down and then on the way up, or just on the way up, neither of which are bad alternatives.\n \n Just avoid companies which are heavily leveraged.\n \n To be honest I won't even look at US stocks because of three things;\n \n 1) Exchange rate may get even worse, ruining any potential gains\n 2) The US economy is fundamentally built on a complete pile of garbage\n 3) High transaction costs for international share purchases on small cap stocks\n \n There are certainly some good buys over there, but it simply isn't worth it for me personally with the exchange rate risk and the transaction costs.\n \n Anyway so far so good, I've bought a few companies that were beaten down for no good reason, made a few k so far this week. Even if it's a better time to buy tomorrow than it is today, now's the best time in 10 years. Except maybe in the US. Some of the bargains are ridiculous, I've bought into companies, which if they packed up their business today, sold off all their assets, and delivered their returns to shareholders, would make me a 30% profit on the spot. And they have strong historical and forecast growth, and pay a pretty solid dividend. I really don't know why they haven't been bid up by funds or bought out entirely.\n \n \n The big question for me is: Is the US Fed currently inflating or deflating. Libertarians largely agree on the theory, but the practice is harder to determine. Personally I fall on the side of inflation, but it's at best an educated guess based on the history of the fed, the statistics are buried.",

   "Inflating. The recent numbers have shown US inflation starting to rise and basic economic principle argues that once interest rates decrease, inflation rises. Plus huge sums of currency are flooding in from foreign investors just like you, as well as sovereign wealth funds. Coupling declining interest rates, huge sums of foreign currency (just look at the rising prices in Manhattan from European firms buying property) flooding in along with the bank bailouts, how could the economy not be inflating?\n \n Given what you've said (and what I own) it is excellent time right now to start buying mispriced assets. I have a fair amount of assets in a Brandes account and I recently spoke to one of their managers. Essentially they are now going on a massive buying spree to load up on stocks that are seriously underpriced. The whole problem (and thus opportunity) with a bubble is that the aftermath of the pop is huge mispricings in the market. Things that should be priced far more are under priced. Not that I'm taking their word on face value, they made me and my family a tidy sum of cash doing this in the past. \n \n And you have to realize in all likelihood that the dollar will rise again. It may take a decade, but if you're willing to hang out that long it will be worth your while. Remember that George Soros made his money by buying huge sums of pound sterling during the British currency crisis and then cashing out when the pound sterling stabilized. \n \n As for hitting the bottom, it appears that many people have accepted that the bottom has already been touched and that recovery is on its way. Perhaps that is so. Yet what bothers me the most is that we haven't actually fixed the core problem. That may be the key reason to stay away from investing considerable sums in the US. I fear the next bubble will be much more damaging.",

   "I'm sure there will be inflation of prices at the consumer level, certainly at least because of the fluctuating exchange rate between the US and China, source of all consumer goods.\n \n The more interesting question is that of \"monetary\" inflation, that is, although the fed is lowering interest rates, is this actually injecting more cash into the system, or are people so wary of debt that the actual money supply is declining even at these low rates?\n \n Further monetary inflation at this point would result in either a persistent inflationary recession, or if cranked up hard enough, perhaps one last boom before the next crash that could easily be far worse than the current one. A deflationary approach would signal a short, sharp downturn followed by a return to normalcy as the economy reconfigures itself in a sustainable way.\n \n If it can steer clear of (monetary) inflation, the main problem the US will face is how to deal with the enormous debts that have been accrued, the solution so far seems to be to pretend it doesn't exist.\n \n But the two alternatives promise two very different investment straegies. Deflation would imply picking companies with solid fundamentals, low debt and good management at low prices and holding. Inflation would imply trying to pick the next bubble industry, buy in, then selling off around the time the general public gets wind of it, before the whole thing collapses.\n \n Back to Australia:\n One company I bought the start of this week; Keybridge capital\n \n http://www.asx.com.au/asx/research/CompanyInfoSearchResults.jsp?searchBy=asxCode&allinfo=on&asxCode=KBC\n \n It has demonstrated consistently solid growth, has low debt levels, exposure to a variety of sectors, executives increasing their holdings, is pursuing (from my perspective) macroeconomically sensible changes in holdings, by selling out on jacked up resources, pays a very nice and increasing dividend.. and so far this week gained about 10%. It hit resistance at the $1.00/share mark, as obviously a number of investors had set it to sell at that point, but each time it dropped to $.95 it was bought back up. It's completely insane to me that it got sold down as far as it did, I really don't understand it. Who knows, I could lose money on it, but I figure in the long run it's a great bet.",

   "Recovery is nowhere close to on its way. We had a reflex rally last week on wal street that leaked over into other markets, but the fundamentals, if anything, have gotten worse. \n \n We have still not seen the spillover from the bond debacle into the derivatives market. It WILL come. There is no question, it is just a matter of time. \n \n We have still not seen the ratings on all that bad mortgage paper written down. The rumor is that the SEC has LITERALLY asked the ratings agencies to put a hold on re-rating those issues because they fear a systemic failure. As a result nearly a dozen bond issues have failed in the last 3 months that were rated AAA or AA even the day AFTER they failed. The ratings agencies are going to HAVE TO start actual ratings markdowns or risk losing all credibility that not only would likely lead to a systemic failure on its own, but would put the US government under intense pressure since so many peoples pensions are riding on those investment grade bonds, and they are in that position because the government has mandated it. \n \n There is an interesting phenomenon going on when it comes to the mortgage defaults we have seen. Typically payment order for people more or less goes mortgage =< Car payment =< Credit cards. We are seeing a complete reversal of that right now. People are literally letting their houses and cars go and holding onto their credit cards. Also, despite the \"sub prime\" label being applied to the current mess, fewer and fewer defaults actually fit into the \"sub prime\" category. The average credit score of mortgage \"defaultees\" last month was between 670 and 680, which is respectable. Also, for all the press that the sub prime arms have been getting, only 42% of recent foreclosures have been related to sub prime arm defaults. It appears based on recent data that it is not just people who \"never should have had their mortgages to begin with\" that are defaulting, nor does it appear that the defaults are contained to people who are even in significant financial distress. People are looking at the falling value of their homes, recognizing that it is a bad investment, so they are dropping them like a bad stock. \n \n I waas talking to steeeve a while back about how my numbers seemed to be low (I was too optimistic) and things were progressing MUCH faster than I thought they would, and I could not figure out why. Now I know. My calculations were basically based on who COULD or COULD NOT afford to keep making their payments. I did not consider the fact that a large number of people would simply treat their house like any other bad investment, cut their losses, and walk away. \n \n In spite of the fact that people are reversing their traditional payment priorities, we are still seeing increases in credit card and auto loans defaults. These two segments will without question continue to deteriorate, and if you think that where we are now is bad, that will make this look like a little bump in the road. \n \n Overall, there is pretty much no hope that we are at the bottom or anywhere near it. At the same time, it may be a good time to buy as long as you are CAREFUL about what you buy. There has been so much panic selling in some segments that there are some really good deals out there to be had. For example, I just bought some mortgage backed securities. I tell people that and they recoil an absolute horror, but the mortgages underlying these particular issues are all prime (lowest credit score in the bunch is 720), all owners have siginificant equity in their homes (50% or better) and, most important, they are all INSURED (mortgage insurance). I bought them at a 70% discount. I also bought some SUB PRIME paper (gasp!!) at a 94% discount over face because all the underlying mortgages were FHA insured. The second group is probably more dangerous an investment than the first, when you consider the fiscal condition of the federal government, but I still think it was likely a good investment.\n \n We still have a LONG WAYS to go before we see any kind of real bottom or recovery, but there ARE deals out there to be made that are worth making. The key is to fins assets that you can come up with a good (absolute is better) argument for being badly mis priced. \n \n Also, for the love of god, keep in mind that \"It was trading 300% higher 6 months ago\" is NOT a good argument for an asset being mis priced. The fact that a particular stock is cheap by historic standards for that particular stock means NOTHING AT ALL when you consider the fact that in many cases those historic prices were based on artificially inflated fundamentals.",

   "Just wanted to add, this doesn't mean I'm positive on the economy. But the economy and stocks don't move in sync.\n \n For example, food prices are soaring, demand for crops is skyrocketing with the combination of increasing wealth in Asia and wasting existing capacity on biofuels.\n \n This is by no means good for the consumer, but creates buying opportunities in fertilizers - the price of potash and phosphate is soaring. I personally like potash producers as there are inherent supply constraints, wheras phosphate production can easily be ramped up as long as the price warrants it.\n \n Protectionism from China, imposing steep tariffs on the export of fertilizer only increases the opportunity here for other suppliers.",
