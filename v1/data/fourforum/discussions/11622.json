Guess we'll see.\n\n \n There's a bell shaped curve for every issue. While I agree with the sillyness of the attention given to Obama's 'lipstick on a pig' characterization of the McCain plan (it had nothing to do with Sarah Palin), I do not agree that McCain is not different. I don't see his plan as '4 more years of the same' based on what GWB has done. I see his plan as an improvement on a plan that jumped the tracks long ago and was not properly set back on them. I see his plan as infinitely better than the socialism and growth-killing that will follow Obama's initiative. I think he's called a Maverick because he will not consistently eat at the boss's feed trough and he often disagrees with the head Republicans. On the bell shaped curve for Republicans, he's as distinct as Zell Miller and Joe Lieberman were on the Democrat's curve.\n \n \nNeither party will serve your interests, get over the childish idea that one party is better than the other.\nThe part ahead of the comma is incorrect, the part after is dead on. There's not a dime's worth of difference between the Republicans and the Democrats. It's the mavericks along the bell shaped curve of each party that are worth listening to. Both Zell and Joe on the Democratic side differed with their hardliners enough to gain my admiration. Joe Lieberman would likely have made a good choice back when we were offered John Kerry. John McCain is a good choice when we are offered alternatives like Obama and Hillary. I would not care who he chose as a running mate. I am pleased that he has chosen someone willing to reform government and get rid of the Lear Jets and expensive perks for government workers.\n \n It will serve my interests better for the government to stay out of administering health care. It will serve my interests better for the government to let me decide what to do with my income rather than overtax me and spend my money as the twerps and crooks within the government ranks would so inefficiently do.\n \n Change is what we need, but not a change toward socialism, higher taxes and more government services.\n \n That appears to be the most important issue to me. Government overspending for the Democrats involves hiring more government employees to create more government agencies to oversee the government giveaway programs established to give the people what the government thinks the people need. Government overspending for the Republicans involves spending more money in the private sector. Overspending by either party is not what we need. We need a balanced budget. We need to put a stop to graft and wasteful spending. We need to get rid of taxes on income and begin taxing consumption. (People with illegal incomes would begin to pay taxes.)\n \n We certainly do not need to follow the aspirations of a Marxist such as Barrack Hussein Obama.",
