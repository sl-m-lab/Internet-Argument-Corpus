I can think of no real-world example to either confirm or deny this, though if Congress were to make a law to change the meaning of a word it cannot apply retroactively. The Constitution states this.\n \n \n\n Even so, the judges don't have the power to change meanings of words....moreover, how can a document that was adopted by the people change so much?\n\n \n I did not say judges change meanings. I said the meanings of words change over time. What is 'cruel' today may not be considered 'cruel' in 100 years or vice versa. Quite honestly I believe what society considers cruel today should have \"cruel and unusual\" applied to it.\n \n \n\n I don't think any words in the constitution have changed so much to give the right to abortion or privacy. Who defined these words? The arguement has no basis.\n\n \n See my example above. Who defines these words? Legal definitions are created by lawyers and judges, Congress and local law-makers. Biological definitions are created by biologists, chemists, etc. Sometimes the same word has different meaning across the fields. Sometimes we, the laypeople, use words that have been corrupted and changed over time, language is in a sense alive. And as language changes, so do meanings.",

   "Whether you agree with Roe vs Wade or not the question comes up about whether it was done correctly or not. Were the judges acting based on what they wanted or not? Were the judges abusing power?\n To me these answers to these questions are yes. Anyone that has slightly studied the constitution and the how the judicial branch was created will know that a judge is not allowed to do what they did.\n Lets hear some comments about this. That way I know which part of the federalist papers will own you :p\n\n \n You are correct. The SCOTUS put itself in the position of being a super-legislature, modifying the Constitution in order to meet a political objctive. Records released subsequently demonstrate that the Court made its decision and then went back to try to find legal justification for doing so. \n \n \n\n Legal criticism of Roe v. Wade certainly isn't new. Scott Armstrong and I reported in our 1979 book \"The Brethren\" that many of the 1973-era law clerks were surprised to see the justices accepting an opinion that reflected medical and social policy rather than constitutional law. Within the court, some called the opinion itself an \"abortion.\" But while writing the book, we did not have access to the newly released memos showing Blackmun and Stewart explicitly talking about \"arbitrary\" or \"legislative\" decision-making.\n \n The \"legislative\" issue is important because it goes to the heart of the court's authority and legitimacy. The Constitution confers the federal legislative power exclusively to the Congress, so any discussion, even in internal memos, about the justices' \"legislative\" purposes takes the court onto perilous ground.\n \n The authority of the Supreme Court rests in large part on the public belief that its rulings, no matter how controversial, reflect enduring and permanent constitutional values, that its conclusions are not arbitrary and that the justices, who are appointed for life, work above the political fray.\n \n Blackmun said in his Nov. 21, 1972 memo, \"It has been an interesting assignment. As I stated in conference, the decision, however made, will probably result in the Court's being severely criticized.\" At the time, Blackmun probably could not imagine that the contentiousness would linger so long after the high court had issued its final ruling. \n http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/~rauch/seamless/articles/roe/woodward.html\n \n\n \n here's a good explanation of the SCOTUS' abuse of judicial power.\n \n\n CONSTITUTIONAL LAW\n \n To guard against judicial despotism, the people chose a written Constitution, the text of which is binding on courts as well as on the legislature and the executive. What is striking about the Supreme Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade is that the Court ma d e no attempt whatsoever to ground its opinion in the constitutional text. Justice Blackman candidly admitted that the \"Constitution does not explicitly mention a right to privacy.\" Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 152 (1973). Notwithstanding the absence of a specific text, he approvingly observed, \"the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy . . . does exist under the Constitution.\" Id. (Emphasis added).\n \n By choosing the word, \"under,\" instead of the word, \"in,\" to describe the source of the right of privacy, Justice Blackman justified the Court's decision to ignore the specific texts of a number of constitutional provisions, and to probe below the surfa c e to the \"roots\" of the First Amendment, to the \"punumbras of the Bill of Rights,\" and to \"the concept of liberty . . . of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Id., 410 U. S. at 152-53.\n \n By digging beyond the constitutional text, the Court declared its independence from it, substituting words and phrases in court precedents for the language of the Constitution. The Constitution simply served as the Court's springboard to leap from the \" privacy rights\" of marriage, procreation, contraception, child rearing and education to a right to terminate a pregnancy, none of which are found in the constitutional text. Thus, it really did not matter to the Court whether it anchored its decision \" in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty . . . or in the Ninth Amendment.\" Id., 410 U. S. at 153.\n \n The Court's cavalier treatment of this issue was deliberate. It was designed to hide the fact that neither the text of the Fourteenth Amendment nor the text of the Ninth Amendment lends an iota of support to the Court's opinion. As for \"liberty\" in the Fourteenth Amendment, prior to Roe v. Wade the Court had consistently defined liberty as a legal term.\n \n In Roe, the Court for the first time considered liberty to be a psychological, sociological, and economic expression. \"The u n wanted child,\" Justice Blackman contended, would cause a woman psychological stress, would impose family responsibilities, and occasion economic hardships. Therefore, he concluded, the woman had a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Id., 403 U. S. at 153.\n \n What an astounding claim! If taken seriously, it could be extended to any situation that interferes with a person's desire to be free from responsibility from another, including a handicapped infant, a dying parent, or even a cantankerous spouse. What is even more astounding is that the Court elevated the woman's desire to be free from her parental responsibilities above the interest of innocent human life in the womb. The Court did so by labeling that life less than fully human. And it camouf l aged that ruling with repeated assertions that the Constitution only protects \"post-natal' life. Id., 403 U. S. at 158-62.\n \n That is not true. The Ninth Amendment, cited by the Court in favor of its decision, in reality directly contradicts it. That provision states that the \"enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage othe r s retained by the people.\" (Emphasis added).\n \n The word, retain, denotes that the rights expressly guaranteed by the constitutional text should not be construed in such a way as to deny rights not specified, but that preexisted in the Constitution. This rule of construction should have led the Court to ask the question whether its reading of the liberty provision of the due process clause - granting a right to terminate a pregnancy - would \"deny or disparage\" a right \"retained\" by the people. Had the Court asked this question - which it did not - it would have found that its distinction between \"potential\" and \"full\" human life violated the unalienable right to life as stated in the nation's charter, the Declaration of Independence. That document, in pertinent part, states that \"all men are created equal\" and endowed by their Creator with the unalienable right to life and, further, that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men. As for the right to life, the Decl a ration is clear, that right belongs equally to all human beings - without regard to race, sex, or birth. According to the law of the Creator, as confirmed by the science of biology and genetics, human life begins at conception. Senate Report on The Hum a n Life Bill - S. 158 pp. 10-16 (97th Cong., 1st Sess. 1981).\n \n Under this definition of the right to life, there can be no distinction based upon whether the life is in the womb or out of it, whether the life is \"potential\" or full. Yet, that distinction lies at the very heart of Roe v. Wade in direct contradiction of the right to life retained by the people in the Ninth Amendment.\n http://www.ccomcor.org/judicialpower.htm \n",

   "In a certain sense they do. In my example of \"cruel and unusual\" where what is cruel changes as society changes, what is illegal under that clause would change.\n\n \n Judges are supposed to be subjected to public opinion...and it is a scary thing when they do go by that. For example with the Cruel and Unusual cases. If the judge uses public opinion to determine what this means he/she will have no standard to which he/she gets this information from. The judge could simply use his/her own view and call that public opinion. In the Ropert case how many Gallup polls were stated in the opinon of the court? none. They did cite international law bans though...So they decided that world opinion in just Europe was the view we should take here in the US. What if they had taken Iran's view on cruel and unusual? That would not be good at all!. The point is, the judge can't go by public opinion because he/she just will go by what he/she wants and not the law. \n \n First off,\n \nThis simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences. It proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power\n\n \nthe courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments, this consideration will afford a strong argument for the permanent tenure of judicial offices, since nothing will contribute so much as this to that independent spirit in the judges which must be essential to the faithful performance of so arduous a duty.\n\n \n It goes on after that to talk about how an independendt court away from the public is the only way it can be a check on the legislative branch and the only way it will function with the law. The first quote shows that all the branches are NOT equal.\n \n \nIf you would quote where they define judicial power, I would be grateful I have access to the federalist papers and I have read some, but I have little desire to plow through them to find a certain point.\n\n \n all I could do would be to write down a summary or something...It has bits and pieces all over the place from 78-83. However, 80 is called \"The Powers of the Judiciary \". So that one may be a good one to look at :). I haven't had time to read it all yet. 78 talks about a lot too.",

ETA, by specific decision I mean the specific bounds of the law in question. \n \n \n\n It is up to the States and Federal Legislatures to determine at what point the fetus' rights are protected.\n\n \n Except SCOTUS does have the authority to decide cases of state law, and so negate them if they deem them unconstitutional. ETA, and at the Federal level there is damn little basis for a national ban.",

   "Whoops, missed this one until I replied to JPSartre12 in the post above this one.\n \n \nJudges are supposed to be subjected to public opinion...and it is a scary thing when they do go by that. For example with the Cruel and Unusual cases. If the judge uses public opinion to determine what this means he/she will have no standard to which he/she gets this information from. The judge could simply use his/her own view and call that public opinion.\n\n \n In a sense. There is no standard because views change as society changes.\n \n \n\n In the Ropert case how many Gallup polls were stated in the opinon of the court? none. They did cite international law bans though...So they decided that world opinion in just Europe was the view we should take here in the US.\n\n \n They go by how they feel the Constitution would apply to this case. This is what they are appointed to do.\n \n They interpreted the phrase \"cruel and unusual\", which is within their power. Whether they base that interpretation on standards that exist outside the US is immaterial. \n \n \n\n What if they had taken Iran's view on cruel and unusual?\n\n \n What would stop an \"originalist\" from doing this, besides his own beliefs?\n \n \n\n That would not be good at all!. The point is, the judge can't go by public opinion because he/she just will go by what he/she wants and not the law.\n\n \n This is why the Court has limits, and the Justices can be impeached.\n \n Steve quoted:\n This simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences. It proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power\n \n I agree. The breadth of their power is small, but within that scope they have great power.\n \n Steve quoted:\n the courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments, this consideration will afford a strong argument for the permanent tenure of judicial offices, since nothing will contribute so much as this to that independent spirit in the judges which must be essential to the faithful performance of so arduous a duty.\n \n Again I agree. The Court is a bulwark against the legislative branch, protecting the Constitution from legislation that is contrary to it. This certainly sounds like judicial review, does it not? Further, this passage implies that the Court is a bulwark for Constitutional rights as well, even if this runs contrary to the desires (and laws) of Congress.\n \n How do these two quotes attack my argument in the slightest?\n \n \n\n It goes on after that to talk about how an independendt court away from the public is the only way it can be a check on the legislative branch and the only way it will function with the law. The first quote shows that all the branches are NOT equal.\n\n \n I don't believe I suggested they were. In fact, I believe I was the one who stated that the Judicial branch was a check on the Legislative while you disagreed.\n \n \n\n all I could do would be to write down a summary or something...It has bits and pieces all over the place from 78-83. However, 80 is called \"The Powers of the Judiciary \". So that one may be a good one to look at :). I haven't had time to read it all yet. 78 talks about a lot too.\n\n \n If I have time I'll attempt it",

They interepeted the phrase based on? There own belief? This is the only thing they could have based it on other then Europes opinion. If they went by what cruel and unusual meant when adopted then they would have come up with a different result. I don't see how they could look at the amendment differently. Why did the meaning change when no one approved on the change? I don't recall the judicial powers including the power to change the constitution. Can Congress change what the constitution means too? Also, whether their interpretation is based on standards outside the US is material..it shows they are not basing things on OUR law.\n \n \nWhat would stop an \"originalist\" from doing this, besides his own beliefs?\n\n \n The constitution. It is not a belief, it is the job they have which is written in the constutition. You know, the power of the Judicial. I can't go to work and say my job is what I believe it to be (unless you the boss...and a judge is not the boss)\n \n \nI believe I was the one who stated that the Judicial branch was a check on the Legislative while you disagreed.\n \n\n I don't recall saying that..however, if I did I made a mistake or you mis read me. The judicial has check on both branches however it doesn't have the power to do more then the constitutions says. They have judicial review if a law violates the consitution.....There is no way the constitution was not violated 15yrs ago with the teenage death penalty case and now it does violate it. The Constitution is a LEGAL document...I don't recall the words of it being able to change. The way you change it is by amending, not impling standards of decency.",

   "And this is why they can be gotten rid of, if they are detrimental to the nation.\n \n\n But what really happens? The Congress sees a way to get what they want via the judicial benches now. So now we have a political bench instead of an independent one. They won't get rid of judges because those judges are doing things the democrats or republicans want and like....they aren't judging or picked to judge based on using the constitution.\n \n \nOk. That's your opinion. Congress can indeed change the Constitution.\n\n \n But it is not opinion...The way the judicial branch is supposed to work is NOT up for opinion...there is a way they are supposed to act and they aren't doing so now. A simple peice of proof is something I just mentioned...the fact that judges are picked on policital affliation now.\n \n \nMy point is... what would stop an \"originalist\" from disregarding the Constitution except his personal beliefs.\n \n\n He wouldn't be an orginalist then....just a liar. And Scalia actually talked about this. He said there will always be liars on the bench but we need to atleast try to work by the way the system is set up. He talks about how judges used to lie about what the constitution meant and now they just simply say that it meant something back then and now means something different...determined by the judges of course.\n \n \n\n Ok. The words don't change, but meanings do indeed change over time.\n\n \n Says who? I still don't understand why it would change meanings and by what basis it does. Frankly there is no standard to do this. We just have to trust judges to do what is best? Well what do they know about what is best. Seems this is why we are picking people that will legislate from the bench now.\n \n \n I can't stress this enough. The reason why judges are picked based on being conservative or liberal is a direct result of the living constitution which was also used in the roe vs wade case and many others from the 60s on up to today. Look back in History..the progession to the living constitution is crazy and scary. Soon we will be indirectly electing the judges and they will rule on party lines :-/ assuming they aren't already.",
