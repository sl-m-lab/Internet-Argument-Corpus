   "Exxon is poised to pass Wal-Mart as America's biggest company purely from crude price increases.\n \n I often wonder what people have against companies making profits as that's what makes our country function. Our major problems with oil as consumers are multiple; increased domestic and international demand, the weak dollar, and our ME aggression. No short-term relief is in sight from any of those factors. \n \n With demand forecast doing nothing but increasing, I can understand fund managers going to a commodity on a short-term profit basis, but long-term commodity investment would scare me to death. Especially with the always present danger of another terrorist attack, which would again take our economy to the mat. Most companies are now dusting off 2001 pro-formas for 2005 projections. \n \n Another side issue with oil prices escalating is the way our government fiefdom reports inflation for political purposes. Transportation and food costs are reported separately, so inflation appears in line with our pathetic growth numbers. When you're using government vehicles and eating in a government dining room, there's not much need to be concerned with those increases.",
