Borrow yen at 1% then deposit it in the US or other high yielding country at 5% and pocket the difference, so the answer to your question is yes.\n \n The problem is that exchange rate swings are a HUGE risk. Changes in the value of the dollar have wiped out, and in many cases put into negative territory, most of the carry trade.",

That can be HUGE.\n \n And you can't try to put on forward contracts to eliminate the risk, because the pricing of forward contracts reflects the interest rate differential such that no arbitrage is possible*.\n \n * The one condition when it is possible is when a particular borrower has unusually preferential conditions in one market - but such preferential conditions automatically enable arbitrage anyway.",

   "Blast it! When crisis situation in the US is advancing with severe losses for over one hundred banks, the government of the United States is doing the worst thing of leading American citizens up the garden path! Don't you know that it will be us - America's taxpaying public - at whose expense the US government is planning to bail out of the crisis! So for example, it is planned to recapitalize financial obligations of the distressed banks so that to redeem them at near-gross value, when only a month ago their cost was some 34&#1118; per dollar! The rest of the value is planned to withdraw from federal budget! To put it in plain words, someone will merely sack that heap of money!! That's our money! They money we pay as taxes! Damn it! I wish I never paid taxes 'cause my heart is bleeding when I see it wasted like that!",
