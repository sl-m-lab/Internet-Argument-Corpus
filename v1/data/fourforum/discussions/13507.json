Vujovich said the U.S. backup doesn't show a gap in Canada's system, but shows how it works.\n \n \"I go to the hospital in Windsor and two hours later, I'm done having angioplasty in Detroit,\" he said. His $38,000 bill was covered by the Ontario health ministry.\n \n Canada eyed in the health care debate\n \n Dany Mercado, a leukemia patient from Kitchener, Ontario, is cancer-free after getting a bone marrow transplant at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit.\n \n Told by Canadian doctors in 2007 he couldn't have the procedure there, Mercado's family and doctor appealed to Ontario health officials, who agreed to let him have the transplant in Detroit in January 2008.\n \n The Karmanos Institute is one of several Detroit health facilities that care for Canadians needing services not widely available in Canada.\n \n Canada, for example, has waiting times for bariatric procedures to combat obesity that can stretch to more than five years, according to a June report in the Canadian Journal of Surgery.\n \n As a result, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care in April designated 13 U.S. hospitals, including five in Michigan and one more with a tentative designation, to perform bariatric surgery for Canadians.\n Canadians visit U.S. to get health care | Detroit Free Press | Freep.com \n",

   "Are you saying that the public option will cost 12 trillion of taxpayer's money? I think you are misinformed about the public option.\n\n \n Here are the numbers from the non partisan Congressional Budget Office which by all counts are considered to be conservative. And remember this is just Obamacare, add to it the cost of cap and trade to each family and the cost of the Treaty of Copenhagen which he plans on signing next month and the added cost that represents for each american translates to a future as a third world country with a third world economy and a dollar that's not worth wall papering our dens with. Read this slowly and maybe you will comprehend the future which we are rushing toward like blind people going over a cliff under the leadership of this dedicated marxist.\n CBO: Obamacare Will Raise Insurance Premiums Even More than Before\n Posted October 14th, 2009 at 10.12am in Health Care.\n On Friday, the last day before a long weekend due to Columbus Day and on the eve of the Finance Committee vote, the Congressional Budget Office revealed some new information about the affect of the Baucus plan on premiums for health insurance. Surprise! After the Senate Finance Committee worked on the bill, health insurance will now cost individuals and families even more than the Congressional Budget Office originally estimated. On September 22, 2009, the CBO estimated that the average premium for a single plan was $4,700 to purchase the Silver plan. Last Friday, the CBO upped their estimate by 6% to $5,000 for the same plan in the same year . Families would also see a $300 increase in health premiums from $14,700 to $15,000.\n The reason for the premium increases are because businesses pass on costs and fees to businesses and customers. As the Finance Committee added more taxes to the bill, the insurance cost to many families increased. The finance committee also lowered the out of pocket premium payments for those making less than 300% of poverty. For example, a family of four with $42,000 in income would now pay $2,600 instead of $3,000 in health premiums. However, purchases of individual plans who make over three times the poverty rate will pay more under the revised Baucus plan as will families with over four times the poverty rate in income.\n CBO still finds that the Baucus proposal would cause individuals who purchase single plans to pay 15-17% of their total income in health insurance if they earn between two and four times the poverty rate. Families would have to pay even more for group coverage spending 18-19% of their total family income for those with income between two and four times that of the poverty rate.\n The CBO tables that were issued last Friday reveal how costs are shifted and increased during a committee markup. It is unfortunate that the new analysis was not released until the Friday before a holiday weekend, where it would go virtually unnoticed before the passage of the bill from Committee.CBO: Obamacare Will Raise Insurance Premiums Even More than Before The Foundry\n \n And don't forget he wants to do another gov't bailout to the tune of another 700 billion dollars as he bails out newspapers to make them official propagators of the gov't party line which such an outlay of printed money will finally and absolutely break the bank of the economic free enterprise machine which america once was. And your false messiah will accomplish all of this after being in office for barely a year. \n \n Congratulations modulus, the socialists have won the war for political power, just look at the reward of generational poverty and third world status we will reap for it.",
