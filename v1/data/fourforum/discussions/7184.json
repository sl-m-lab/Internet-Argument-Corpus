   "I came up with the idea for this thread while replying to two threads in this forum. Those on the Left and/or who identify themselves as Socialists state that being rich financially is wrong, that all wealth must be \"divvied up\" equally by government edict. This just is simply not the case at all. Jesus certainly did not condemn the rich, only whether they were willing to surrender their lives to God. Joseph of Aramethea is a prime example of a wealthy man who's heart is in right standing with God. The reason why I'm using this example is that God never condemned wealth per se, just how it is used or abused. As we move on through this thread, I'll be sharing biblical principles for sound fiscal management.",

   "I would imagine that when a rich man does not spend money on saving the lives of others, he might find it hard to justify his choices at the pearly gates.\n \n \"So, why did you buy four new cars over your life, but not donate a similar amount of money to the red cross?\"\n \n I mean, when it's a choice between buying pet food, or donating canned food to the Salvation army, I can't see how one could justify buying pet food as a religiously moral choice. The same applies to buying a new computer instead of flying to india to help build a school, or putting your kids through college instead of buying polio vaccine to be distributed in africa.\n \n When a person has disposable income, and another person somewhere in the world is starving to death, or dieing from an easily preventable disease like Typhoid or Polio, then the person who has that disposable income is at least partially responsible for those deaths. He could have spent that extra money on vaccines, training, flights, agricultural development, education, whatever. But he chose not to, and as a result, those things were not purchased and those lives were not saved. This applies moreso to those who have more disposable income, because they can save more lives with less personal sacrifice. Bill Gates could donate forty billion dollars, and still have as many assets and as much income as middle America. It isn't the sole responsibility of the rich to care for anyone, but they can do more, and sacrifice less, than others. Which makes it much harder to justify their choice to NOT do it.\n \n Pretty hard to justify that to the big fella when you get there.",

   "I believe that what is actually said in the Bible about wealth is that \"the love of money is the root to all evil.\" I think the main idea is to not let money be the main drive in your life. How much money you have is not as important than what you do with it.

He compared the kingdom of Heaven with a guy who owned a vineyard and wanted workers to come work for him. As the day progressed, more workers came and then at the end of the day, the owner gave them each the same amount. (Now, isn't that a communist thing?) The workers represented people who came to believe in Jesus and the owner represented God. The day that they worked represented life and the night represented death and their equal wages represented their acceptance into Heaven no matter how late in life they became a believer, which is what the time they came to work for represented.\n That's my own commentary, and I could be wrong.

There is also the parable of the man who hoards a fortune and then dies in the night without spending it: the point is that holiness is the only thing worth a mention.\n \nHow much money you have is not as important than what you do with it.
