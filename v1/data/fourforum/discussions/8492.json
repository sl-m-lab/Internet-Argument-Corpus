Bleeehhhhh!\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/13/world/europe/13irish.html\n \n July 13, 2006\n Peaceful Marches in Northern Ireland \n By REUTERS\n BELFAST, Northern Ireland, July 12 (Reuters) - Protestants paraded through towns across religiously divided Northern Ireland in commemorative marches on Wednesday with no repeat of last year's violent clashes, allowing the army to stay off the streets for the first time since 1970.\n \n The annual marches, celebrating a centuries-old military victory but viewed by Roman Catholics as provocative displays of triumphalism, began as smoke from overnight bonfires and fireworks gave way to the clamor of pipes and drums.\n \n But even as Protestant Orangemen and their bands returned home through the traditionally tense Ardoyne area of northern Belfast, things remained relatively calm.\n \n A confrontation was avoided as, for the first time, march supporters went home on buses instead of accompanying their bands through an area that had been a flash point for disputes between neighboring Catholic and Protestant communities.\n \n Last year Catholic protesters hurled gas bombs and bricks at the police after a July 12 march through their area. In September, Protestants attacked the police during weeks of rioting after a parade was rerouted away from a Catholic area.",

This rather oblique compliment belongs to a more serious age. What is so striking about the \"beatification\" of the woman who styled herself \"Mother\" Teresa is the abject surrender, on the part of the church, to the forces of showbiz, superstition, and populism.\n \n It's the sheer tawdriness that strikes the eye first of all. It used to be that a person could not even be nominated for \"beatification,\" the first step to \"sainthood,\" until five years after his or her death. This was to guard against local or popular enthusiasm in the promotion of dubious characters. The pope nominated MT a year after her death in 1997. It also used to be that an apparatus of inquiry was set in train, including the scrutiny of an advocatus diaboli or \"devil's advocate,\" to test any extraordinary claims. The pope has abolished this office and has created more instant saints than all his predecessors combined as far back as the 16th century. . . .\n\n \n http://www.slate.com/id/2090083/",

Dr. Fox specifically held Teresa responsible for conditions in this home, and observed that her order did not distinguish between curable and incurable patients; people who could otherwise survive their ordeals would be at a heightened risk of dying from infections and lack of treatment.\n \n Fox conceded that the regimen he observed included cleanliness, the tending of wounds and sores, and kindness, but he noted that the sisters' approach to managing pain was \"disturbingly lacking\".\n\n \n You might also look here:\n \n http://members.lycos.co.uk/bajuu/",

   "Dr. Starks was specifically commenting on the medical conditions of the home. His knowledge of anything beyond that is assertion only. He did no research into finances. There are certainly some questions concerning that, but those questions are more properly directed at the vatican than to question MT's love of the poor and her kindness and caring and devotion. Even Dr. Starks commented on her and her nun's kindnesses.\n \n The biggest criticisms have been that she spoke with anyone. Including those that the world hated. However, this is perfectly in line with her beliefs of loving for the sake of christ. She did not discriminate between poor and wealthy. She had no money of her own. She traveled across Europe only because others showed her kindness. She never bought a train ticket or plane ticket. Others gave it to her of their own free will.\n \n MTs creditials are not really in doubt. You can bring in a few witnesses that opposed her ideals and attacked her for it. However, I can bring in millions that describe a humble caring human who won the Nobel Peace Prize.\n \n EF",

My apologies.\n \n I am familiar with the fallacy. However, the comment is under scrutiny is one that is a matter of judgment and opinion and not really factual. Specifically:\n \n \nMother Teresa was a dreadful old woman who toadied to the rich and glamourous while espousing the belief that those in poverty were meant to suffer in order to lessen the suffering of those more advantageously placed in society by virtue of money and birth.\n\n \n The comment that MT was dreadful and toadied to the rich and glamorous was unsupported and the only evidence given when requested was an article written by an atheist. Now you provide some additional information but the complaints are largely against the RCC not MT. Financing has always been handled by the vatican for ALL RCC holdings including MT's charitable organization. \n \n MT's claim that the poor have value in society is in direct contradiction to most folks who claim that the poor have no value and then try to eradicate them. MT did not try to eliminate poverty but rather chose it for herself and to provide them with care and comfort. She never claimed to be a hospice organization merely to care for those that could not afford care. Please note that many of those cared for were turned down by other institutions in India for various reasons including the Caste system which is still very active. Dr. Fox did not offer his services I noticed, merely criticized what was happening.\n \n EF",

I think the people she was referring to in that comment were members of her order. HOwever, that aside, she felt that living in poverty was a thing to be celebrated. This is true. The reason being that the impoverished could more easily identify with christ and in her mind then identify more with God. To her, that was the ultimate good.",
