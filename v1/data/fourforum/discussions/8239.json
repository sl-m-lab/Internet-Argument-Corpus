   "There's a bad mentality out there that AIDS is a \"gay disease\" and that somehow it's retribution for behavior.

They were ALSO more likely to not use a condom if they did violate their abstinence pledge.\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48509-2005Mar18.html\n \n Teaching abstinence only is just not working. I'm working to substantiate this claim, but Penn & Teller's show stated that eleven states had tried to validate that their \"abstinence only\" programs had helped with teen-age pregnancy and STD prevention. NONE of them could show any improvement.\n \n If we want to fight HIV, we have to do more than just tell kids \"no\". It just doesn't work. And it's demeaning to our kids...\n Give them ALL the information available, and let THEM make THEIR OWN decisions for themselves.\n \n Of course, if the parent wants their child not to receive all the info, they can pull their kid from the class. Perhaps put out two classes, with one being \"abstinence only\" and another giving all the options. (Although I think that last option is a little mundane...)\n \n So, in a nutshell, another way that the churches could help would be to not hinder education on the issue of HIV and sexual education. I think that we would find that their \"purposes\" are suited BETTER if we taught kids EARLIER in life about sex ed, and didn't treat it like a dirty little secret. Parents be honest and open with their kids on the subject instead of withholding information, and possibly not even talking to them about it at all...\n \n http://www.democrats.reform.house.gov/Documents/20041201102153-50247.pdf\n \n http://www.plannedparenthood.org/pp2/portal/media/pressreleases/pr-050614-abstinence.xml\n \n http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/factsheet/fssexcur.htm",

   "I've said this before and I'll say it again. Evangelical Christians among other similar groups also effect the rate of HIV infections by demonizing gays. When anyone is made to feel that the attraction they have is sick and \"unnatural\", they feel as though they have no choice but to live their life \"in the shadows\". Having little self respect for who they are and for the health of their body. \n The silence that comes from this attitude towards gays is a death sentence in many cases. \n I have been in a relationship for going on 9 years with a positive person. He has told me many times that he was never taught about the dangers of sex, much less homosexual sex. His sexuality was known but not spoken about out of shame. Always being told that homosexuality was wrong, he treated his life as if it had no value. His father, like many fathers of gay children, distanced himself. He sought male companionship in an unhealthy way which led to his hiv positive status. \n I am saying that if the attitudes towards homosexualty would change, so would the relationships. Many gay persons would take a healthier approach to the relationships they engage in because they would not feel so ashamed. I am not trying to place blame, I am only pointing out that those that speak out so much against homosexuality perpetuates the problem with HIV infection. \n I am happy to hear that christians want to do more, I just wish they could see the huge impact they would have if they would just stop the hate.",

Lots of other studies to say it doesn't help or makes things worse.\n \n Nobody on this forum believes studies - they counter medical journal studies with some half-baked religious website. So I like to think about it this way.\n No method works 100% right? So if 50% of those that are taught abstinence only do not have sex, they are fine. What about the other half that go ahead and have sex with no other information? They are at risk for pregnancy and STD's. You're sending those kids out with no information at all.\n Abstinence is a perfectly wonderful idea, but only if it works.",

But I believe the intention of abstinence pledges is often not necessarily to fight against STDs, but to encourage Christian youth to live the Christian way of living in a world that doesn't believe sex should have many boundaries. In other words, I don't think STDs are the primary reason for abstinence pledges at all (even if they, in some cases, claim that it is.) \n \n I think the best answer is to encourage abstinence, but not at the expense of education about protection (and even encouraging it for when abstinence isn't a priority or when youth \"give in\"). IOW, have both. In our family, we still believe that sex is best in the context of marriage, and our kids believe that as well. There's nothing wrong with that.
