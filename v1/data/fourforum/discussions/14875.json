   "Exactly what do conservatives advocate spending on?\n \n\n \n The number one would be Defense spending. They also like to spend billions to rebuild other nations, putting America on the back burner. The major problem I have with Conservatives is that they have no problem reducing revenue by crying TAX CUTS, TAX CUTS, But they never seem to realize that reduced revenues added to increased spending across the board only creates more debt. Conservatives are \" Borrow and spend\" Liberals are \" Tax and spend\".. either way no Party is better than the other. They work against each other in the Public Eye to fool the American people into believing they are working for us, but behind closed doors they make deals to put money into the cooperate big shots pockets and the middle class be damned.\n \n Liberals, conservatives.. All the same... And none of them are actually fixing anything or paying down the debt. \n \n \n \n\n What do you mean \"no?\" That's pretty much what I said about them.\n\n \n I said no to your statement that I was ASSUMING people like Bush... I don't personally see any difference in Conservatives.. yeah you say \" Moderate\" but that is only a word used to distance themselves from the likes of Bush and Cheney. They're still conservatives, just like the Tea party. \n \n Honestly I'm disgusted with ALL politicians at this point. Obama doesn't have the Guts to do anything and the GOP doesn't have the Power to get anything done.. so as usual our Government is in a stalemate and the country is suffering for it. \n \n I'm waiting to see how the debates go with the Debt Ceiling. The Tea Party has promised no compromise.. What they do now won't matter, because either way the Tea Party will be finished as far as the voters are concerned. They are locked in a battle where there is no winner.. whatever the Government does the People will lose.. that you can count on.",

Fiscal conservatives often consider reduction of overall government spending and national debt as well as ensuring balanced budget of paramount importance.\n\n \n \n Neoconservativism seems to fit your description much more accurately.\n Neoconservatism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n\n Neoconservatism is a Political philosophy that combines a pragmatic approach to economics with a traditional approach to culture and Social issues. [1] In economics, unlike paleoconservatives and libertarians, neoconservatives are generally comfortable with a limited welfare state; and, while rhetorically supportive of free markets, they are willing to interfere for overriding social purposes.[2] On Military issues it defines national Interests in a manner that allows for the inclusion of ideological interests e.g. the defense of other nations with similar ideologies for geopolitical purposes.\n \n\n \n \nLiberals, conservatives.. All the same... And none of them are actually fixing anything or paying down the debt. \n\n \n That's because they're trying to fix the economy rather than stepping back and giving it room to fix itself.\n \n \nI said no to your statement that I was ASSUMING people like Bush... I don't personally see any difference in Conservatives.. yeah you say \" Moderate\" but that is only a word used to distance themselves from the likes of Bush and Cheney. They're still conservatives, just like the Tea party. \n\n No, they're not. They're Neocons, as I explained. If you want to say what is wrong, it helps if you know what is right.\n \n FYI, I am not a Tea Party advocate. The Tea Party is an off-topic issue here.",
