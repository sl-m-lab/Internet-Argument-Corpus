   "I know that there has been much debate about this but here is my POV, this will be long but please hear me out. I'm going to play devils advocate here.\n \n 1) Many children are killed every year by guns.\n \n True, but more children drown in pools, of coarse that does not mean that either situation is good. What would your recommendation be to secure the pools? Should we get rid of them and everything else that hurts kids? No, we should require that the be kept secure and that if a child is harmed by one then the owners of the pool are liable. This should also apply to guns.\n \n 2) One should rely on police to protect them.\n \n Police arrive too late to even arrest someone like 80% of the time. Most calls occur after the crime is committed, therefore all the police do is try to catch the criminal after the fact. That's not personal protection, it merely serves to protect the rest of the community after the fact. There was a case where a citizen sued a police agency for not protecting them and the police said something like \"It is not our responsibility to protect citizens from every attack\". It's pretty obvious that your safety is in your own hands. Do you think the criminal will give you time to call police? Are you sure they will get there in time? Would you feel safer if you had a gun when you here your front door being kicked in? YOU are the police department of your house!\n \n 3) You should comply with your assailant and hope for the best.\n \n First of all, you are placing your life in the hands of someone who obviously doesn't care about anyone but themselves. You are also volunteering to be a victim, \"Yes, go ahead and rape my 11 year old daughter, I most certainly am not going to do anything. Please don't kill us afterwards to eliminate witnesses, I've been nice to you.\" Of course there are some instances where you must comply, if they have a gun to your head and their finger on the trigger there is little you can do. If you think it is better to leave your life in the hands of a criminal than to defend yourself in EVERY situation then that's your choice, but I think you are wrong.\n \n 4) People who carry guns make me feel unsafe.\n \n You have the right to feel unsafe if you want, but why aren't you scarred around cops? I'm sure it's for one of two reasons, either you think that they are more competent or you think that citizens are more prone to pulling out their guns. If you are assuming that they are more competent you are probably wrong most of the time. EVERYONE that I know who carries realizes the awesome responsibility the have and most invest MORE money in training than they actually spend on guns. Of course not everyone does this and , unlike some people, I don't have a problem with requiring more training to get a license. However, it is ignorant to assume that someone who carries is inherently incapable and irrational. Also, as long as the gun stays in it's holster the threat it poses to you is basically zero. Did you know that police miss around 80% of the time? Do you really think that armed citizens are any worse? Police don't train as much as they should.\n \n 5)People who carry guns infringe on my rights.\n \n What right, the right to feel safe based of false beliefs? Do you now that if you make them stop you are infringing on their CONSTITUTIONAL right to bear arms? The 2nd amendment warrants a debate of it's own, but to me \"..., the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" means exactly that. They said \"people\" not \"militia\", it's pretty clear. It's OK for you to be scared of guns and not want the responsibility and training that goes along with them, but that gives you no right to take mine away.\n \n 6) Other countries that have stricter gun laws have less crime.\n True, but those countries had less crime long before the stricter gun law were passed. Besides, this is not Europe and people are different here, lets look at examples that are more local. I will give a list of the most restrictive states and the least restrictive states and arrange them by the number of violent crimes per 100,000 people.\n \n State - Violent crime per 100,000 in 2004\n \n California: 552\n Illinois: 543\n Massachusetts: 458\n New Jersey: 356\n New York: 441\n District of Columbia: 1,371 I know it's not a state.\n \n not much gun control:\n \n Alaska: 635 open carry w/o a permit.\n Oregon: 298 Can carry in schools!\n Vermont 112 Virtually no state gun control laws!\n Virgina: 276 carry w/o a permit.\n Montana: 294 Open carry w/o a permit.\n South Dakota: 171.5 Open carry w/o a permit.\n \n Out of these states here is the breakdown of violent crime from most to least:\n \n 1.GC DC* I know it's not a state.\n 2.GR AK\n 3.GC CA*\n 4.GC IL*\n 5.GC MA*\n 6.GC NY*\n 7.GC NJ*\n 8.GR OR\n 9.GR MO\n 10.GR VA\n 11. GR SD\n 12.GR VT\n GC= Gun Control GR= Gun Rights \n WHERE WOULD YOU FEEL SAFER?\n \n I'm going to stop there because if I wrote all of my thoughts (not feelings) about gun laws no one would read it. Unlike our president I welcome the comments of those who do not agree with me. If you are going to make a statement about what I said please put the number of the statement you are referring to.

   "bigj480 I also agree with you except for the addition of these points \n \n #4 \"People who carry guns make me feel unsafe.\"\n \n Then you should know this there are apx 100,000,000 = 100 million gun owners in the US that means that 1 out of every 3 people in the US are gun owners. Everywhere you go, everyone you see and meet over your entire life, 1 out of every 3 of those people are gun owners. Then ask yourself a question how many people have I passed in my entire life? Now how many times have you seen someone brandish a gun? I'll bet that with 99.99% of you it's been never. To have the feeling of being unsafe? Who are you kidding that feeling is unfounded and your problem. So why should I give up my right to protect myself and family? Because you have no common sense? \n \n #5 \"People who carry guns infringe on my rights.\n \"What right, the right to feel safe based of false beliefs? Do you now that if you make them stop you are infringing on their CONSTITUTIONAL right to bear arms?

It's OK for you to be scared of guns and not want the responsibility and training that goes along with them, but that gives you no right to take mine away\"\n \n There is no right to feel safe. Where in the constitution does it mention emotional rights??? Just as there is no right to be free from crime, though you do have the right to protect yourself from crime. The founding fathers also in their infinate wisdom defined the militia as the whole people except for a few public officals. And the militia is to be made up of free men. Why would the fathers say this? they stated that only in this way would the rights of the people be protected. Why? Since the people won't take up arms to undermine their own rights. Where an army will which is actualy what the national guard is. By the way a free man is someone who is not in the military. Why? In the military you are government property no freedom of will.\n \n 6) \"Other countries that have stricter gun laws have less crime.\n True, but those countries had less crime long before the stricter gun law were passed. Besides, this is not Europe and people are different here, lets look at examples that are more local. I will give a list of the most restrictive states and the least restrictive states and arrange them by the number of violent crimes per 100,000 people.\"\n \n Englands homicide rate is larger than the US's and the brits also don't call it a homocide unless they have caught the killer. In Switzerland with the highest gun per capita rate in the world including minimal restrictions on Machine guns also boasts one of the lowest crime rates in europe. And if you go around the world you will also find that any country with no gun ownership rights and a low crime rate also has no rights for the accused and a brutal criminal justice systems which don't even recognize the most basic human rights.",

Appon chking you are right on this though you are misleading since you didn't do the figures per capitia which changes the numbers to be closer than the raw numbers indicate. Since the US has over 6 times the population of England. Using raw numbers it puts the US to have apx 20 times the homicides, where per capitia its more like apx 3 times. But there are other factors that may change the numbers to make them even closer like illegals comitting crimes in the US where England dosn't have that problem. And that since US has gun control that is varried through out the states unlike Switzerlad which has almost no gun control and has one of the lowest homicide rates. I think that if the US were to change it's laws to mimic Switzerland that the homicide rate would drop in the US substantly.

   "The Swiss comparison doesn't work either... care to try again?\n \n \" . . . A new law prohibiting storage of military ammunition at home was adopted by the Swiss parliament on 27 September 2007. A more comprehensive revision of the gun laws has been proposed by an alliance of political parties and campaigners, who are seeking a referendum to change the law. The campaign needs to obtain sufficient signatures on a petition for a referendum to take place. \n \n Military guns \n \n There are about 200,000 Swiss men who undertake military service in annual courses of 2-4 weeks. They are permitted to keep their military weapon at home. Rey-Bellet and her brother were shot and killed by her husband, using his military weapon, with which he later committed suicide. A further 1.5 million military guns are estimated to belong to former militiamen. \n \n Military guns are used in 280 gun deaths a year in Switzerland, according to reserach by Professor Martin Killias of Lausanne University. This is the equivalent of a gun death rate of 3.7 deaths per 100,000 people, which is higher than the gun death rate in most other Western European countries, for all types of guns, not just military guns.\n \n Civilian guns \n \n In addition to the military guns, there are an estimated 230,000 civilian guns in the country. Switzerland has a relatively high level of gun possession, with guns in 36% of households. This is linked to the high proportion of guns used in suicide (27%), according to a recent study by researchers at Zurich University. In countries where gun availability has been reduced, the proportion of guns used in suicides has also reduced. . . . . \"\n \n http://www.iansa.org/regions/europe/Swisscampaign.htm",

Sorry this info Is something I haven't kept up with lately but I will be watching now. Thanks for the info this is good to know. Gun control at it's finest. What do suicides have to do with gun control? If a person is going to commit suicide they will commit suicide whether there is a gun or not. Since Switzerland has such a high gun ownership rate don't you think the use of a gun in suicide would be higher? The method has nothing to do with suicide. Also military gun deaths in that statement, where does it say homicides? Are any of those deaths justified, accidents or suicides? Sounds to me like they are stacking the deck.

Where it's pretty obvious that gun control doesn't work. In the US the criminal justice, social, and economic factors are uniform. Unlike seprate nations with greatly varying systems of justice, social, and economic factors. In Massachusetts the Bartly Fox laws were inacted in the early 70's with an imediate 30+% drop in homicides which the anti's celibrated. What they didn't say is that before the laws there were no laws allowing anyone to carry a concealed hand gun. Under Bartly Fox to carry a hand gun off your property you had to have this lic. to carry which allowed you to carry concealed. There were no restrictions on the lic. and if you applyed for it unless you were a convicted felon you got the lic. and the liciensing athority couldn't deny you the lic. This ment that everyone who had a pistol got a lic. and you had a substanial increase in the number of people carrying concealed hand guns. This law has over the years been strengthend and relaxed. Every time it got stricter the crime rate got worse and when it was relaxed the rates fell. There is no denying this it is a fact of history.",

It may be a lot easier, for example, for someone to commit multiple armed robberies in a given period of time in say someplace like NYC, than it would be in a rural state like Vermont or Montana. this in turn, would more naturally increase the chances of someone being shot, because of not giving up their wallet, or attempting to resist in saome other manner. \n \n Bear in mind, I'm not saying that this is the case. I'm saying that it may be a factor. With just the numbers you've given us, I don't think there's necessarily proof of corellation between lack of crime and relative freedom from restrictive gun laws. The likely-hood is that it certainly helps, and in fact may be one of the major reasons. I just don't think you can say it's the only, or even the main reason.",
