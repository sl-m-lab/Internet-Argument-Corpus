If you can pose an idea that is logically consistent with science, about how life originated, and no one can show it to be false, then it's for all practical purposes, a possibility, and you can become it's champion, and while people may think you waste your time on a fringe possibility, you would be not be incorrect to claim it \"could be the answer\".\n \n \nDeficient or merely not a the stage required for understanding?

Given what we know, if there WAS consciousness directly responsible for the initiation of the process, then creation (natural, not supernatural) is true, and evolution follows. If no consciousness was directly responsible for initiating the process, then creation is false, and evolution follows after some non-creation event.\n \n BUT, if natural creation is true, we must then discover what process started the natural creator's life chain. It seems reasonable that within the universe, life can only ultimately originate from the universe, and not a consciousness, else, it wouldn't be consistent. You would be claiming that a consciousness within the universe, existed before universe existed, which doesn't work. That's why the argument always ends with the same conclusion. If the universe has a beginning (big bang), then the only logical origin for life, is the universe itself. \n \n I sure would think it's cool if we find a rift in space that gods and what not come poking into our universe through, but we can't call that a possibility yet.\n \n These are examples of possible possibilities (So I can be constructive on your thread)\n 1. Something that exists outside our universe created our universe (which is the same as creating us).\n 2. Something that exists outside our universe can manipulate our universe through PROBABALISTIC variation.\n 3. What we observe is not reality, and our entire framework of reality is not actually \"real\" (brain in a vat, or more recently, the matrix)\n \n I think any of these may be revelaed through gaining more facts (knowledge).
