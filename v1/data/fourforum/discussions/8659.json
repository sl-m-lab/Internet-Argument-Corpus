   "Hi from Germany. Thanks Lord I'm resident of a country, which is a democratic one already. There are lots of countries which have yet to come a long and challenging way to gain it. More there are whole regions with such a status say Central Asia. \n I know that some of our mps and experts have been active in CA during recent years to make local peoples ready to democratic changes step by step. And Americans have also been there all this time. So this was kind of competition LOL. Their method is revolutions branded \"colored\". \n Perhaps they used to be such in more civilized countries of Ukraine and Georgia. In CA those were bloody riots in the cities of Andijan and Bishkek. There were no matured opposition there and Americans put stake on terrorists and criminals and that is on blood. (BTW that's why there are few Andijan refugees here in Germany. I guess our spying agencies refused entrance to many so called refugees being well in the know who's who.) \n So now CA peoples associate democracy with blood, which is no good of course. Americans were after dethroning dictators in CA but instead they inoculated local peoples against democracy. \n I got to know some Andijan refugees hosted by European countries have started coming back to the country of Uzbekistan. This leaves hope for the better. Perhaps European democracy will suit CA better. Germany and others should make a try.",
