   "Conservative Christian leaders who believe the word \"evangelical\" has lost its religious meaning plan to release a starkly self-critical document saying the movement has become too political and has diminished the Gospel through its approach to the culture wars. \n \n The statement, called \"An Evangelical Manifesto,\" condemns Christians on the right and left for \"using faith\" to express political views without regard to the truth of the Bible, according to a draft of the document obtained Friday by The Associated Press.\n \n \"That way faith loses its independence, Christians become `useful XXXXXX' for one political party or another, and the Christian faith becomes an ideology,\" according to the draft.\n \n The declaration, scheduled to be released Wednesday in Washington, encourages Christians to be politically engaged and uphold teachings such as traditional marriage. But the drafters say evangelicals have often expressed \"truth without love,\" helping create a backlash against religion during a \"generation of culture warring.\"\n \n \"All too often we have attacked the evils and injustices of others,\" they wrote, \"while we have condoned our own sins.\" They argue, \"we must reform our own behavior.\"\n \n The document is the latest chapter in the debate among conservative Christians about their role in public life. Most veteran leaders believe the focus should remain on abortion and marriage, while other evangelicals - especially in the younger generation - are pushing for a broader agenda. The manifesto sides with those seeking a wide-range of concerns beyond \"single-issue politics.\"\n \n Among the signers of the manifesto are Os Guiness, a well-known evangelical author and speaker, and Richard Mouw, president of Fuller Theological Seminary, a leading evangelical school in Pasadena, Calif. Organizers declined to comment until the final document is released.\n \n They say more than 80 evangelicals have signed the statement, although only a few names have been released. A. Larry Ross, spokesman for the authors, said the theologicans and Christian leaders involved are seeking to \"go back to the root theological meaning of the term evangelical.\"\n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080503/ap_on_re/evangelical_manifestoPerhaps the Catholics can follow suit?",

   "Yeah, I read this the other day. \n \n The problem is that, by taking this stance, these evangelicals are ALSO telling others (other evangelicals) how to run their lives. THEY are meddling too. People have political views for all sorts of reasons, and I don't see why religion can also be a part of peoples' motivations for their politics. \n \n Evangelicals aren't a monolithic group. The term is often descriptive rather than a term of identity, and they are very varied in their views. I'm an evangelical I suppose, but who cares?? It doesn't really mean anything. There's not card carrying membership here. That's why this letter is pointless, and I wouldn't sign it either. Though I do agree PERSONALLY in much of what it espouses. I'm just not interesting in telling others how to live their lives, evangelical or not.\n \n I also take issue with telling people they shouldn't be involved in \"single-issue\" politics, and I see this a lot. I wonder how many gay marriage-focused people would be willing to give up single-issue politics? Wonder if they'd have asked MK king and others in the civil rights movement to stop being \"single-issue\" in their politics since it was mostly focused on civil rights and not other issues too? Wonder if these anti-war folks in anti-war groups would so readily stop being \"single-issue\" in their politics? The point being that sometimes single-issue politics is not a bad thing. Sometimes it's necessary. I suspect the real problem is that whoever made this \"manifesto\" just happened to not agree with the single-issues they happened to see many evangelicals focused on.\n \n It's also notable the article also basically says nothing about what organization is behind this. Sorry, but this is yet another case of a glaring lack of information.",

   "Apparently there are some here who just flat-out don't realize that telling people how to live their lives is something that happens all across the cultural and political landscape; not just religion. That doesn't make it right, but it's so common that we have no business viewing religion as any sort of 'island' in this regard. When someone tells another person they shouldn't be driving an SUV, they're telling them how to run their lives. When someone tells another person they shouldn't support war, they're telling them how to live their lives. This has already been explained here before (obviously to no avail), but there's just no \"except-religious-people\" clause saying who can be political and who can't. Frankly, I think having such a standard that gives stronger condemnation toward evangelicals in this regard than OTHERS who do it is a double standard. \n \n I suppose it would help somewhat if those who tend to think religion and politics should never mix actually approached it consistently, for once. Since there's a sizeable amount of people out there who's religion leads them toward more 'liberal' causes, then one would think these folks who believe religion shouldn't influence politics would condemn THOSE cases too. Imagine the responses if consistency were any concern whatsoever, and they used the same standard ...\n \n \"What? You believe *God* would WANT gay marriage in this country? Doh, sorry! You mentioned religion and God--you shouldn't be in politics!!\" \n \n \"What? You believe it's *religiously* wrong to go to war? Nope ... sorry! That's religious motivation. No politics for you!\"\n Can anybody seriously imagine the same anti-evangelicals who condemn the religious right saying something like that? Yet we hear DNC candidates all the time saying things to the effect that the values they fight for politically are values that come out of their religion--they indicate such nearly every time they try to appeal to religious voters. But no condemnation toward them letting their religion affect THEIR politics ...\n \n It's also interesting that the very same thing about 'creating artificial opponents' is done with religion that is being claimed is done BY religion. Examples are all those apparently droves of evil dastardly \"gay hating\" Christians, or warmongering non-compassionate evangelicals.

Just because something has to do with religious belief shouldn't mean people can't vote their consceinces, run for office, or support a law if they think it's a good idea. No one's holding any gun to your head saying \"you have to be a member of X religion\", anyway. The problem here is that people such as yourself has moved this \"freedom from religion\" goalpost so far that you're now basically arguing that even the act of accepting the litigation put forth in law by a religious person equates to losing freedom from that religion. Which is kind of an odd way of thinking of it really; you're still free to be as religious as you want after such law. It seems beyond just freedom of religion, and freedom from religion, you've now created a NEW class here--let's call it \"freedom from any EFFECTS OF RELIGION.\" And I have to say that the men who penned the bill of rights have to be turning over in their graves right now over how far removed this sort of obfuscation (to use a Founditism) gets by being far removed from the intentions of the founders.\n \n \nReligion ought to be used to tell people how to run their religious lives, and politics should be used to shape their political lives.

Why is someone not allowed to have have their view they can assert their ideology/way-of-doing-things best into law just because it happens to have come out of their religion? You post begs the question as to why religion can't be allowed to speak to something that's not religious already. If religion sees injustice, it SHOULD speak out and fight against it, not just limit itself toward cases that are already religious. And it's a good thing your approach hasn't been taken historically, or civil rights in this country might never have happened the way they did. It doesn't matter if the \"higher ups\" or anyone else are the ones doing it--it's a free country and people can engage their views into politics. It's the way the system works.\n \n But what do you mean by \"the means\" they are doing it? Be specific, please.\n \n It just seems to me that if we took this idea of yours that \"Religion ought to be used to tell people how to run their religious lives\" and not political, we'd have a lot less good being done in the world that gets done. If a preacher has something good to say, there's no reason it can't be taken into consideration just 'cause it's got that 'ol dirty word \"religious\" attached to it. If a preacher tells his people to oppose war 'cause it's wrong, are you going to be consistent and oppose such use of religion in politics? Or if a preacher tells his people God wants them to support gay marriage and they start doing it? Will you cry foul THEN, as well? Or it is that you just only want to oppose religion having political influence when the issue just happens to be something you disagree on?",

That's not the same as saying someone is imposing religion. \n \n Imposing a religion is when someone says ...\n \n - \"You can't worship your way, you have to worship MY way.\"\n \n - \"You HAVE to worship as a Christian, not as a Hindu.\"\n \n Those are examples of imposing religion.\n \n When someone fights for, say, pro-life laws, they aren't imposing religion. Because pro-life isn't a religion. It may be that religion influenced them on that stance, but religion also influences people in terms of laws against violence or theft. And other things might influence someone on any given stance. For instance, if a lawmaker was simply taught that so-and-so is wrong, then the mere fact his parents taught him that is a basis for his values. It may not be a GOOD basis, but you can't tell a lawmaker he can't fight for a law on that basis. The process has to bear that out. People have all sorts of reasons they fight for laws, and you don't post a requirement at the door of the capitol that says \"only so-and-so reason allowed for fighting for legislation.\" If you're going to tell religious people they can't fight for laws just because their values comes out of religion, you either need to tell EVERYONE that they can't bring their values to the table for any number of reasons, or you're singling out religion for special intolerance, which is unreasonable.\n \n Re The Lemon Test, it has 3 stipulations:\n \n 1. The government's action must have a secular legislative purpose;\n 2. The government's action must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion;\n 3. The government's action must not result in an \"excessive government entanglement\" with religion.\n \n Examples 1 and 2 actually ALLOW religion as a motivation for fighting for laws. Number 1 doesn't say it has to ONLY have a secular purpose, and #2 says advancing religion can't be the PRIMARY effect. And of course #3 is a class case of begging the question.",

Those aren't the same statements at all. Why are you portraying what I said differently than what I actually said?\n\n I see no difference important enough to waste half a post on. If a problem is so small that you don't see a need to do anything about it then that is, for all intents and purposes, no problem. Problems you deal with, if you can ignore it it's an annoyance. Now, are you going to get back to the debate, or is it just quibbling over word choice from now on?\n \n \n\n I've already \"admitted\" there's a problem there. And yes, honestly I think I have as as good an understanding of the \"issues\" in regards to evangelicals as pretty much anyone. \n\n \n And this from the guy who says he can't even define Evangelicism? You're seriously going to tell me you know as much about what's going on with the Evangelical church as a bunch of people who have made it their careers? Then perhaps you can explaing to me how these apparently misguided experts leapt to such an erroneous conclusion?",

You're seriously going to tell me you know as much about what's going on with the Evangelical church as a bunch of people who have made it their careers? \n\n \n Kronos, there's no need to be be intentionally hard-to-deal with here. We can have a reasonable discussion on this without you looking for things to jump all over. I too have made it my career to 'know what's going on' in the Church (evangelicals and others), both historically and in the present, and didn't make that claim lightly. I have a degree in church history, and I feel I am well-read in many aspects of church life both historically and in the present, and I've had experience working in numerous evangelical churches. Again, I do feel I have as good an understanding of evangelicals as most anyone--perhaps better than some (though I'm sure less than others). But more importantly, I am confident my understanding of evangelicals is good enough to have to come to the conclusions I have stated in this discussion.\n \n \nThen perhaps you can explaing to me how these apparently misguided experts leapt to such an erroneous conclusion?\n\n \n I find that our discussions often differ because you sometimes see things in almost ALL black-and-white terms and I often see shades of gray and details. This discussion has been no exception. In some ways the people who signed that letter (and we still don't know where it originated, by the way) were RIGHT, and in some respects their concerns are over-stated and demonstrate an unrealistic approach toward evangelicals to begin with. Most evangelical churches don't, in fact, engage in political activity at all. It is by far the exception rather than the rule. It also takes an approach that views evangelicals as monolithic--as if they were united and are at all able to reign anything in, any more easily than people described by many other terms as a descriptor. The term 'evangelical' is descriptive; it's not really a term of organised identity. (Though there are are organisations that are evangelical, evangelicals are not an organisation.) \n Like most issues that carry some controversy, this is a complicated one.",

I guess to be exactly accurate I should really rephrase what I said to say I have a history degree with an emphasis in church history (rather than IN church history).

I don't think the evangelical movement is like the natural sciences (such as physics) where credentials might matter more in terms of understanding what goes on among evangelicals and the issues afoot. In fact, I know of no Degree of Evangelicalism. And what's to say that the many more scores of evangelical leaders who haven't signed it didn't do so because of their understanding of the evangelical movement? And more importantly, there is nothing to indicate whether the creator of this letter understands the evangelical movement; in fact there is nothing to indicate who really even crafted the letter at all!\n \n \nIs that your interpretation?

You seem to ask for such information just to have something to belligerently argue against rather than for a genuine and friendly exchange of ideas.

I do notice you've added the word \"successful\" now as a qualifier to the term career, but I consider myself successful as well. And if you say that such a career only gives me insight into my own church, then we need to also note that the same may very well apply to those who signed the letter. I doubt much of anyone has immersed themselves in the evangelical movement on a daily basis any more than I or many other pastors have. The only reason anyone would is if they were some sort of activist for all evangelicals, but because the movement isn't unified like that, I don't know of any such role anyone out there holds. The point of my comment wasn't to indicate I know MORE than others (I probably don't), but rather to indicate that I see no reason I don't know as much as pretty much anyone about something so vague as the evangelical movement. I really do think I have a good sense of it, just as you probably have a good sense of the field of physics. (I believe you've indicated before that it is your field of expertise. Incidentally, I would never be so pretentious as to challenge you if you were to claim that you probably have as good a sense of the basics of physics as most anyone. Again, I can't think of any reason you would want to argue over things like this other than belligerence.)\n \n \n\"belligerence\" aside, this is a debate forum, not a chat room.

It's not your propensity of expecting people to defend anything that I take issue with here; I too expect people to do that, and I have no problem with people proving me wrong if I'm wrong. (Of course giving an alternate opinion is not the same as proving someone wrong.) I said nothing about that in what you responded to. I just tend to prefer debate that is more like discussion not out to just oppose people or trip them up, but to learn and exchange different views even in potential disagreement. There are different ways of debating--they don't all have to be the sort that 'knocks heads' against each other or looks to catch the other in an error or just to prove them wrong. Some debates ARE that way depending on how the participants act, but that's more sport-debate--the type you might find being engaged in on a high school or collegiate debate team, which tend to follow formal rules. There's nothing wrong with that here either, but I'm just more interested in something that's friendly and not out for the purpose of just winning something against someone. Indeed, we see more discussion-based (rather than aggressive \"try-to-defeat-someone\" style of debating) here between people all the time; you yourself have engaged in it before with other people. And if one is truly interested in learning/sharing views instead of mainly defeating someone else, then there's little reason for them to treat it like a 'rhetorical bloodsport', if you will.",
