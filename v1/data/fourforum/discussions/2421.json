   "Hi everyone!\n I was challanged by Mr Jack to provide evidence for a Global Flood in the time of Noah about 4,500 years ago. Although not a scientist myself, I will display some of the evidence that I know of and will add more as new information as I gather new sources. I would also like you people to kindly add your views, either positive or negative to make this an educational and friendly thread in which to post your views.\n \n Here are only a few evidences that I know of (geology is not one of my strong suits):\n * There are many fossil beds that are found all over the world in sedimentary rock that was deposited by water so rapidly as to bury some creatures while still giving birth and eating food. \n \n * Fossil \"graveyards\" around the world, where the bones of many animals were washed together, buried and fossilized, are evidence for a watery cataclysm like the Flood. For instance, sea animals have been found burried with animals from the land. These animals don't *normally* live together, so why should they be burried together?\n \n * There is abundant evidence that many of the rock strata were laid down quickly, one after the other, without significant time breaks between them. For example, preservation of ripple marks requires rapid burial, as in the Flood (e.g. lower Triassic rock, England). Folding of sedimentary rock without cracking or heating, such as at Eastern Beach, Auckland, New Zealand, suggests the folding occurred before the sand and mud had time to turn into stone, consistent with rapid deposition during the Flood.\n \n * Polystrate fossils (ones which traverse many strata) speak of very quick deposition of the strata. \n \n * The scaracity of erosion, soil must have been deposited in quick succession. \n \n * Dykes (walls) and pipes (cylinders) of sandstone which connect with the same material many layers beneath show that the layers beneath must have been still soft, and contained much water. That the sandstone could be squeezed up through cracks above to form the \"clastic\" dykes and pipes, again shows rapid deposition of many strata.\n \n * The three sisters in Australia is evidence of a catastrophic flood (please ask me to extrapolate on this if you want to).\n \n * Uluru in the heart of the Australian Outback is another example of a catastrophic flood (once again ask me to extrapolate on this if you want to).\n \n * The same basic story of a Global Flood is found in hundreds of cultures around the world, including hte Australian Aboriginals.\n \n * Coal can form quickly when forests and marine creatures are buried rapidly. There are extensive depositives of coal throughout the whole world which indicate a Global Flood with catastrophic conditions.\n \n * See John Morris' 1994 book \"The Young Earth\" and S. Austin's 1994 \"Grand Canyon: Monument to Catastrophe\", Institute for Creation Research USA for more evidences for Noah's Flood. [Many information from above came from \"The Updated & Expanded Answers Book\".]\n \n I will add more information as I find it. Thanking you all ahead for your participation and hopefully no name calling or anything or the sort. Just focus on the evidence produced please. Have fun. emoticon_smile",

To put this into more understood terms, since a gallon of water weighs a couple, say four, pounds, in the last five thousand years, the earth has absorbed 5,000,000,000,000,000, or 5 QUADRILLION GALLONS of water! Of course the water from the Flood wouldn't be here today!\n\n First of all, pure water weighs approximately 8.34 lbs per gallon (not 2-4, as the author suggests).\n \n Second of all, even if we take their inaccurate estimate of 4 lbs per gallon, their math is off by a factor of 2. In other words, they used the very inaccurate estimate of 2 lbs per gallon of water. \n \n C'mon... if the author doesn't even know how much a gallon of water weighs, and then tries to fool you with faulty math and the ol' switcheroo (\"water weighs a couple, say four, pounds\" and then they use 2 lbs in their calculations), can you really put much faith in the rest of what they say?\n \n Or can we expect the author to create another 'theory' that suggests that water didn't weigh as much back then, because the molecules that make up water were still in their infancy and hadn't matured, so they didn't weigh as much as they do now?\n \n Additionally, I'd be willing to bet that if we looked at that article in Discovery that we would find that the author of this website took the Discovery article out of context. Even if that's not the case, the author makes the assumption that \"If this trend of a billion tons of water a year has been continuing since the Flood...\" What if that trend hasn't been continuing since the flood? What does the Discovery article suggest?\n \n And if that isn't enough... the total amount of water contained on the earth right now is 3.26 x 10^20 gallons. In other words, the amount that has been 'soaked' up at the bottom of the oceans in 5,000 years (according to the author's assumption) is approximately 0.00037% of the total amount of water on the earth. I don't think that would amount to a global flood if it were spit back up by the bottoms of the oceans.\n \n To me... this sounds like a typical creationist's ploy (either intentional or through ignorance) of taking things out of context, misrepresenting the facts, etc... This is one example. In one article. That supposedly contains 'evidence' of a global flood. Hmmm...",

   "To sinjin and to Mr Jack (for more information on some of my points that I got from several creationist resources):\n \n The \"Institute for Creation Research USA\" is not a reputable scientific organization. Their research's conclusions are foregone. There isn't enough water to cover the Himalayas or other large mountain ranges even with no polar ice caps. \n \n For one, we are not here to disucss an organisation's information in this thread - although I believe it to be quite good.\n \n In response to your last claim about there not being enough water to cover the Himalayas or other large mountain ranges, I agree with your assertion. It is correct. But you have made several fatal errors with your argument. For one, you are assuming that the pre-Flood landscape and land features are the same as the post-Flood land features (i.e. after the Flood) which is wrong. But in reality, the pre-Flood geography would have been radically different, i.e. we would have had no tall mountains (from Biblical framework).\n \n The Bible only refers to \"high hills\", and the mountains today wre formed only towards the end of, and after, the Flood by collision of the tectonic plates and the associated upthrusting. In support of this, the layers that form the uppermost parts of Mt Everest themselves of fossil-bearing, water-deposited layers. This uplift of the new continental land-masses from under the Flood waters would have meant that, as the mountains rose and the valleys sank (as Psalm 104 suggests), the waters would have rapidly drained off the newly emerging land surfaces. The collapse of natural dams holding back the floodwaters on the land would also have caused catastrophic flooding. Such rapid movement of large volumes of water would have caused extensive erosion and shaped the basic features of today's Earth surface. \n \n As a result of this extensive erosion (caused by the retreating Flood waters) it is not hard to envisage the rapid carving of the landscape features that we see on the Earth today, including places such as the Grand Canyon of the U.S.A. The present shape of Uluru, a sandstone monolith in central Australia, is the result of erosion, following the tilting and uplife, of previously horizontal beds of water-laid sand. The feldspar-rich sand that makes up Uluru must have been deposited very quickly and recently. Long-distance transport of the sand would have caused the grains to be rounded and sorted, but we don't see this at Uluru, i.e. they are jagged and unsorted. Which indicates rapid transportation (like through a cataclystic Flood). If they had sat accumulating slowly in a lake bed drying in the sun over eons of years, which is the story told in the geological display at the park centre, the feldspar would have weathered into clay. Likewise, if Uluru had sat in hte once-humid area of central Australia for millions of years, it would have weathered to clay. But besides the \"fact\" that it has reportedly been exposed to weathering for hundreds of millions of years, the feldspars are still very fresh, as though they were exposed only yesterday. \n \n Similarly, the nearby Kata Tjuta are composed of an unsorted mixture of large boulders, sand and mud, indicating that the material must have been transported and deposited very rapidly. \n Receding floodwaters eroded the land, creating river valleys. This explains why rivers are often so much smaller than the valleys they flow in today - they did not carve the valleys. The water flow that carved out the river valleys must have been far greater than the volume of water we see flowing in the rivers today. This is consistent with voluminous Flood waters draining off the emerging land surfaces at the cose of Noah's Flood, and flowing into the rapidly sinking, newly prepared, deep ocean basins. \n [Above information from the \"Updated and Expanded Answers Book\" by AiG, p. 165-166.]\n \n I believe your original question was \"Where did all the waters come from?\" There have been many different creationist responses to this. For a detailed response to this I would suggest that you look at the article Noah's Flood - Where did all the water come from? . At the moment, I am not feeling the best so I will not be summarising the main points and giving you a direct answer to your question. Sorry. It is never pleasent to feel sick.",

As you may have noticed, rocks don't bend very easily - a sudden force (by \"sudden\" I even mean increasing the pressure on a rock over a time that may seem long to people) will shatter a rock. In the Himalayas, Rockies, Appalachians, we see that the strata are smoothly folded over long distances. This is only possible by applying great pressures over very long periods of time, at pretty high temperatures. A sudden collision of the continents at the end of the flood would produce very different geologic features.\n \n That is the difference between accepted geologic theories and creationist theories.

In support of this, the layers that form the uppermost parts of Mt Everest themselves of fossil-bearing, water-deposited layers. This uplift of the new continental land-masses from under the Flood waters would have meant that, as the mountains rose and the valleys sank (as Psalm 104 suggests), the waters would have rapidly drained off the newly emerging land surfaces.

It was a miraculous event.\n \n *There's an interesting link from this site to one at\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/paluxy/onheel.html\n \n where-by the writer gives a number of different explanations to the 'track' formations. This is an interesting article for two reasons...\n \n One, that the writer claims to have been 'open' to creationist arguments, which I find quite extraordinarily naive thing to say\n \"Although we were at the time open to creationist ideas and actually hoping to confirm the human track claims...\"\n To say that he would be open to the idea that would totally undermine Darwinian ideas of time is amazing.\n \n The person is a biologist, not a geologist, but claims to be able to ascertain how the tracks were formed. And then he goes to show that the tracks were made by a number of different processes, forgery, rain, other geographical phenomena etc (recall this fella is a biologist!). \n \"Claims of human tracks occurring alongside dinosaur tracks in Texas have not stood up to close scientific scrutiny, and in recent years have been largely abandoned even by most creationists. Although genuine dinosaur tracks are abundant in Texas, the alleged Paluxy \"man tracks\" involve a variety of misidentified phenomena\"\n \n So that what incredibly looks like a series of tracks, becomes according to him, a number of individual objects unrelated (except by proximity), each caused by totally different processes; a claim almost as hard to believe as that they were caused by an ancient man, considering too, that all the dinosaur tracks are accepted as dinosaur tracks, and not the products of the same shifting phenomenas.\n \n Funny that, two sets of prints side by side... one set are deemed genuine dinosaur tracks, the others, aren't 'tracks' in the sense that they were made by one individual, but are a series of marks caused by a shifting series of phenomena... a miracle!",

As I said, I am arguing based on the arguments AS PRESENTED, you, the rationalist, are prepared to broaden the scope wherever you feel it might add weight to his argument.\n \n \nCool. I thank you for your opinion. As I stated, I do not present these as proofs of creation, for I need no proof. I look at this merely as a study of knowledge, and from what I see is one man attempting to come up with an impossible explanation -that what appears as a series of tracks were formed by a number of totally different phenomena, where-by right next to them, another series of tracks, are produced by an animal. \n\n \n \nThat's what you see. Can I ask, what are your qualifications that enabled you to come to that conclusion? Or do you just view man and dinosaurs co-existing as common sense?\n\n \n I am, as I said, not presenting the dinosaur-man co-footprints as an argument for creation, I am looking into the merits of the argument, now the third time I've mentioned this.\n \n And so far, I judge the argument by its merits, whereas you add things to 'beef-up' the case.\n \n \nFurthermore, he is FAR from one man. I'd say he's one of millions as opposed to one of very few who actually believe they are human tracks. Even most Creationists distance themselves from this issue.\n\n \n He is one man presenting an argument. I am judging that argument. You are now saying that his argument, however good or bad it is should not be judged on its own merits, but by the fact that, in general, it agrees with a number of other arguments.\n \n As to Creationists...\n Do they? You have the stats to back that up? Was their a poll of Creationists? Or are you again just accepting a blanket statement as fact. Again you are adding to the argument without basis. Unless you are prepared to add in facts through quoted sources, otherwise you are just stating what you hope to be the case.\n \n \n Further to this, the idea that he would have us believe that he went into the investigation with the belief that he'd be prepared to accept these tracks as being man-made (not in the sense of being forged), which is a nonsense.... so it seems to me. \n\n \n \nWho's the mind reader now?\n\n \n He states this, that the tracks were caused by geological phenomena, and forgery, etc. He has stated that he accepts a whole number of different causalities, other than they are as they are claimed to be by Creationists.\n \n \nSecondly your generalised argument about the knowledge of science is interesting. I had in the past presented 'facts' to prove creation. If I produced a study by a geologist out of his field, this was reason enough for most pro-evolutionists to dismiss it. This sort of thing doesn't seem to work both ways... which tells me more about your a priori beliefs, and the willingness to accept facts from people perhaps not best suited to present such. Likewise, I too have an a priori stance - I'm not saying I don't do the same thing - which of course seems to undermine the 'rationalist' path to knowledge) \n\n \n \nAgain with the mind reading.\n\n \n Not at all. You here go in for the same pattern. You are prepared to give him a leniency unapparent in his qualifications, just assuming that if he has any science, he might have other sciences... enough to be qualified to comment (even though he should have stated these)\n \n You allow him a lee-way you would not a creationist... others have done it, they deride a creationist scientist if he strays anywhere outside his chosen field. You allow it for this fella.\n \n You don't see how much faith you are putting in him because you've devoted such faith in his ability to answer your questions - you don't question his ability, but just accept it, adding in details that simply aren't there as presented. You are a mind-reader par excellence\n \n \nA geologist out of his field? Interesting. I'm not aware of the fact that a geologist can be out of his field. He may not have the experience others do in a particular aspect of geology, but that does not disqualify him. I'd be willing to have a look at your facts.\n \n Waxy\n\n \n You aren't just willing to look at the facts, but to add to them to beef-up your case. For instance you grant to him qualifications he doesn't state. You make generalisations about creationists without presenting anything to back that up. He accepts the 'footprints' as being made by a number of causes, despite being alongside footprints which he assess are real - again the shifting mysterious series of phenomenas that were able to so cleverly lay down a corresponding series of tracks right alongside real tracks.\n \n This, as I said, bespeaks more about your own wishes than what is real.",

   "\n \n \n \nAgain, I'm sorry, but I fail to see your point. I'm not sure whether my defintion (sic) of science is too narrow, or whether it's you that doesn't grasp what science is.\n \n The whole basis of science is to form a hypothesis and test it.\n \n Life on Mars -\n \n Observe Mars\n Orbit Mars - see geologic formations very similiar (sic) to those on Earth\n - from hypotheses based on this similarity\n - design experiments that will enable the test if these hypotheses\n Land on Mars - perform experiments, collect data\n - analyze data and test hypothesis, refine those that work, discard those that don't\n - form additional hypotheses and experiments based on new data, start cycle again.\n \n I fail to see how this is not science?\n \n Waxy\n\n \n Specifically, what similarities are you talking about? Earth (now with life) is very different physically from Mars (which has no life). What do you see are the similarities between an earth-life model and a lifeless-Mars model? When was Mars at such a stage that it supported life - in so far as there's no evidence that it ever did? \n \n Where was this observed - what data of life on Mars has been found to test? (Or, for that matter, any other planet other than earth.)\n \n Is it science to have a hypothesis, and continue to hope for half a century? When does hope cease becoming science and becomes faith, in your view?\n \n For instance, why would aliens use radio waves? SETI is looking specifically for radio waves. Why is it science to hypothesise that aliens, if they existed, would follow the same technological pathways we did? (It doesn't sound very 'alien')\n \n \n You gave a link to a few things that were hypothesizes and turned out to be false, SO? What of all the things we know know (sic) or advancements in our understanding that were gained by forming and testing hypotheses? Are those all irrelevent (sic) because a couple proved incorrect?\n\n \n I don't wish to discredit science per se, but simply put human knowledge back within the context of humanity... whereas you told earlier of some drive to get beyond the humanity\n \n Post 48\n \nScience, unfettered by agendas and beliefs, is purest form of human endeavours. It's what has gotten us where we are, and is what will enable our continued survival and understanding of our world.\n\n \n Enabled our continued survival? That's a value-laden statement if ever there was one, and typical of the pro-science debaters I've come across - that ultimate faith in man. I have mentioned that you and others put scientists on a pedestal that is just simply unworkable a belief... man without his foibles.\n \n In your defence of a biologist (regarding the 'footprints' debates), you are prepared to give him the attributes of a geologist... though there's no evidence for such. You are prepared to add to his credentials simply because it would suit you to believe it to be so. You are acting on faith... because your model of reality needs scientists to be either providers of answers or capable to provide the answers. I fail to see how this belief system is based on science, and not on wishful thinking.\n \n My idea of science, and this is based on my world-view, is that science is a noble pursuit, so long as it does not take precedence over attempting to be close to God. I don't believe this statement of faith needs to be supported by evidences, as it is a statement of faith (I'm sure sinjin will find that 'illogical' which is itself a misunderstanding of what faith is... you, Waxy however also have been expressing ideas of faith, but you think it is based on rationality)\n \n This is at the core I am interested in, studying ideas. Your ideas, you believe are rational-logical, but are largely based on faith... faith in science in general, faith in particular scientists, faith that when science acts on faith (e.g. aliens), it still is science.",

Of course it should be judged by its own merits. I hate when people twist things to beef up their arguments, don't you? \n \n My point was that he is not alone in his work. Numerous other qualified scientists' work in numerous associated fields beyond biology and geology supports his, a million was hyerbole, my apologies. \n \n Beyond that, I fail to see how someone's argument is less valid because it draws on the conclusions of others, or agrees with them?\n \n \nAs to Creationists...\n Do they?

I've since read numerous other articles from the site, both by Creationists and Evolutionists, and I'd say the assessment is fair. It's also based on my personal experience on this board and others. \n \n This brings me to another point - when is someone's statement considered qualified? What is required for a statement to have basis? Do I actually have to poll every Creationsist in the world and publish a paper, or can I draw an inference from sources I've read and my own experiences? How quoted sources is enough? 1? 10? 100? \n \n \nHe states this, that the tracks were caused by geological phenomena, and forgery, etc. He has stated that he accepts a whole number of different causalities, other than they are as they are claimed to be by Creationists.\n\n \n He stated clearly, and I quote\n \n \"Although we were at the time open to creationist ideas and actually hoping to confirm the human track claims, we resolved to examine and record whatever we found as thoroughly and carefully as possible.\"\n \n So you read his mind and determined he was in fact on an evolutionist witch hunt right from the outset?\n \n He collected the data, did his research, and formed a conclusion.\n \n His actual conclusion was that the tracks were indeed dinosaur tracks, not some unusual geologic phenomenon. There goes your beef. He didn't dream it up, he researched it, thoroughly, and brought in experts from other fields when he was underqualified.\n \n \nNot at all. You here go in for the same pattern. You are prepared to give him a leniency unapparent in his qualifications, just assuming that if he has any science, he might have other sciences... enough to be qualified to comment (even though he should have stated these)\n \n You allow him a lee-way you would not a creationist... others have done it, they deride a creationist scientist if he strays anywhere outside his chosen field.

You are a mind-reader par excellence\n\n \n I wish I was, maybe I'd be able to figure out what it is that you see when you read my words that I don't see.\n \n So because others have derided Creationists, I must be guilty of it? Interesting. Where have I not allowed a Creationist leeway? All these accusations against me about mind reading and generalizing, yet you proceed to do exactly what you seem to so despise.\n \n You fail to undertand that his research is a collaboration. He did not draw these conclusions entirely on his own. Again with faith. Do I have faith in his ability? I suppose I do, I wasn't there looking over his shoulder the entire time, so I guess it is \"faith\" to believe he followed proper scientific procedure. Of course I would question his ability, again, you're judging my actions and thoughts without basis. I read the site thoroughly and looked at his conclusions and what evidence was provided, I also saw a list of other \"qualified\" people with whom he collaborated. Add that to my knowledge of the subject, and I will put my \"faith\" in his conclusions. I only use the word faith because I haven't actually examined the data myself.\n \n Again, I'll ask you, what makes a person qualified? Is it simply a degree? Is it experience and research? What? Does having a BSc in biology and not geology preclude someone from being an \"expert\" in geology (something he does NOT claim to be FYI), despite having spent vast amounts of time both learning and researching the associated geology? Does it matter whether they're Creationist or Evolutionist in their beliefs?

It's impossible for me to test every hypothesis and perform every experiment myself in order to ascertain its veracity. As such, I do place faith in the fact that I haven't been deceived. I don't see it as faith in science, but rather, more of a faith in my fellow man. \n \n Science itself is based on the ability to support a claim with repeatable, physical proof.

When do you become an expert? Last I checked, there was no PhD in tracks.\n\n \n Here you make an assumption again. I would credit a hunter-gatherer as an expert on tracks. No need to have a PhD. However, leaving aside your obsession with degree qualifications, a biologist might have specialised in dentition, and I would not suggest that this would qualify them to give expert comment on tracks. You simply assume that he is a biologist who\n a) studied tracks or animal locomotion (in his degree)\n and\n b) geology\n as he comments on both.\n \n If he'd grown up in the bush, with frequent recourse to hunting, I'd have accepted him as an 'expert' on tracks.\n \n I made no stated assumptions, other then I feel that if he hasn't listed his qualifications it is because he's not qualified. I agree that this is an assumption on my part, for he may well be an 'expert in tracks'. If he is, I would concede this point. But I stated from the beginning that I came to this article as it is, and on reading it, judged it as it is. If you are aware of other articles that expand on his qualifications you would have saved a lot of time by quoting them earlier... so that these articles could be presented and judged.\n \n As it stands you just make an assumption about these qualifications, and I can't, as I've not seen the evidence... Funny that you're the evolutionist basing your beliefs on faith, and I'm the creationist demanding to see the evidence.\n \n \nI fail to see how I have embelished (sic) either him or his findings. He has published numerous papers in both Creationist and Evolutionist journals, and is recognized as a leading authority on the issue. Furthermore, he is not alone in his work, he has both worked with and consulted numerous other respected \"experts\" in the fields in which he is working\n\n \n He has published numerous articles, therefore he is an expert, is the argument you make now. Let's again look to what he did when fresh out of university, he stated he was a biologist. Full stop, nothing else. He then studied the tracks, and has published on them. You raise him to 'expert', when right from the beginning he fails to live up to this.\n \n You try the 'numbers' game... a lot of people agree, therefore it's true, a lot of articles written, therefore they're true.\n \n Should you finally produce some conclusive evidence, say, his qualifications, then this matter might be resolved - excepting that you've been holding out on nothing but faith all this time.\n \n \nI am, as I said, not presenting the dinosaur-man co-footprints as an argument for creation, I am looking into the merits of the argument, now the third time I've mentioned this.\n \n And so far, I judge the argument by its merits, whereas you add things to 'beef-up' the case. \n\n \n \nI don't see this, but perhaps I'm blind to it, could you show me how I've \"beefed up the case\"?\n\n \n It is because you are giving him abilities that he has not stated. He quite simply says ... student of biology. To you that means he's qualified to give expertise not only on track formation, but geology as well. In fact, you've retrospectively given him the mantle of expert. If he's been studying tracks 50 years, or so, I won't specify a specific time, he could be said to be an expert... but fresh out of university, he made these conclusions, and he's not wavered. He was, then, an expert from day 1 (according to you).\n \n And, according to you he's able to detect human involvement - that is forgery.\n \n You base this simply on the wish that it was so.\n \n \nHe is one man presenting an argument. I am judging that argument. You are now saying that his argument, however good or bad it is should not be judged on its own merits, but by the fact that, in general, it agrees with a number of other arguments. \n \n \n \nWhen did I say that? Of course it should be judged by its own merits. I hate when people twist things to beef up their arguments, don't you? \n\n \n You said clearly...\n \n Furthermore, he is FAR from one man. I'd say he's one of millions as opposed to one of very few who actually believe they are human tracks. Even most Creationists distance themselves from this issue.\n\n \n Quite clearly you are arguing that, aside from being a lone voice on the issue, other people have come to the same conclusions, you even suggested most creationists, but fail to site any evidence to support that later claim. I am still waiting. It is all well and good of you to try to suggest something about the minds of creationists, but I'm afraid that mind-reading is not my forte.\n \n You make so many just-so statements and expect people to believe it. He has done the same, and you believe him.\n \n You are making arguments based on numbers.\n \n \nMy point was that he is not alone in his work. Numerous other qualified scientists' work in numerous associated fields beyond biology and geology supports his, a million was hyerbole (sic), my apologies. \n \n Beyond that, I fail to see how someone's argument is less valid because it draws on the conclusions of others, or agrees with them?\n\n \n Are they given to making the same just-so arguments he makes? Just because he's no expert, and writes a dozen articles, doesn't make him any more an expert. Others doing the same thing, if that is what is happening, equally adds no weight to the argument. 1 x1 x1 x1 is still one, no matter how many 1's you add to it, it just doesn't get bigger.\n \n What qualifications do they have? What writings have they presented? Are the people making the claims about man-made tracks less qualified? You seem to think so.\n \n \n As to Creationists...\n Do they? You have the stats to back that up? Was their a poll of Creationists? Or are you again just accepting a blanket statement as fact. Again you are adding to the argument without basis. Unless you are prepared to add in facts through quoted sources, otherwise you are just stating what you hope to be the case. \n\n \n \nThe statement about Creationists was drawn from (sic) article, that I freely admit. I've since read numerous other articles from the site, both by Creationists and Evolutionists, and I'd say the assessment is fair. It's also based on my personal experience on this board and others. \n\n \n Indeed, a just-so statement was made, and accepted by you unless you are prepared to show me the creationist sites you've read this on. Are they representative of all creationists? I am a creationist, I don't have a web-site... how was my opinion factored into the equation? Many of my friends equally are creationists, and none of them have web-sites either. I don't believe that they were polled. I'll go check, I don't want to make an assumption as you have. (they also haven't posted on web-site debts - so you're ability to read their minds astounds me).\n \n \nHow (many?) quoted sources is enough? 1? 10? 100? \n\n \n You tell me your criteria for surveying, and I can tell if it's enough. Otherwise it's another just-so argument that you simply take as 'fact'.\n \n \nThis brings me to another point - when is someone's statement considered qualified? What is required for a statement to have basis? Do I actually have to poll every Creationsist (sic) in the world and publish a paper, or can I draw an inference from sources I've read and my own experiences?\n\n \n Ah, now we're not talking about creationists, but creationist experts. You say that there's no qualification to being a track expert, so how are you going to figure out which creationists to ask?\n \n He generally refers not to experts, but creationists in general...\n \"By this time a growing number of creationists were becoming disenchanted with Baugh?s methods and claims...\"\n \n Which is it you are talking about?\n \n \n He states this, that the tracks were caused by geological phenomena, and forgery, etc. He has stated that he accepts a whole number of different causalities, other than they are as they are claimed to be by Creationists. \n\n \n \nHe stated clearly, and I quote\n \n \"Although we were at the time open to creationist ideas and actually hoping to confirm the human track claims, we resolved to examine and record whatever we found as thoroughly and carefully as possible.\"\n \n So you read his mind and determined he was in fact on an evolutionist witch hunt right from the outset?\n\n \n Not at all. I've already dealt with this statement of his, and found it rather naive for him to think that any right-thinking person would believe it to be so... it is the type of thing you believe - that a scientist is above personal bias.\n \n Logic says this fella is a biologist with an evolutionists bent. He claims that he was prepared to go along and make a judgement that might have undermined all notions of Darwinism (with regards time-scale) that he'd ever been taught. I am making an assumption here, but it seems so ludicrous that he would be that sort of exceptional person, especially in light of the fact that he's prepared to comment on factors he's not stated he's an expert in. It just seems too arrogant.\n \n I am assuming that he, like you makes just-so arguments to be factual. Very likely he makes assumptions based on numbers of 'experts' rather than facts... though this of course is just a guess on my part.\n \n \nHe collected the data, did his research, and formed a conclusion.\n\n \n Based on what expertise?\n \n As I said earlier, if a creationist scientist comments outside his field, he is lampooned. You see no problem with this biologist making comments on geology... even if he studied it, he wouldn't necessarily be an expert. I studied Irish, and I can't speak it. Nil thuigimm e.* You give him credit simply based on the fact that he's a scientist, and he's published a work that agree with you... so you add in details that aren't present.\n \n He may well have studied tracks all his life, I don't know. He doesn't state this, and as I said at the very beginning, I am only able to judge this work by the work itself. You have some special insight that transcends my capabilities.\n \n \nHis actual conclusion was that the tracks were indeed dinosaur tracks, not some unusual geologic phenomenon. There goes your beef. He didn't dream it up, he researched it, thoroughly, and brought in experts from other fields when he was underqualified.\n\n \n He said some of the tracks were dinosaur tracks, but also some were forged, and some were geological depressions. Even within the category of dinosaur tracks, some were straight out caused by dinosaurs tails, some by their snouts, and \"Some were mud-collapsed\" dinosaur tracks.\n \n Which is what I stated earlier, a whole range of phenomena were concerned in the creation of these 'tracks' besides the normal phenomena for the agreed dinosaur tracks. This is quite extraordinary, as well, he seems to have stumbled on a dinosaur which just happens to have a special walking gait to account for these other 'tracks'.\n \n You then argue that even if he wasn't an expert, he collaborated with a whole lot of other people, who must have been experts\n \n *I've got \"Teach Yourself Gaelic\" plus all the notes etc from university, and I'm still unable to converse",

   "Specifically, what similarities are you talking about? Earth (now with life) is very different physically from Mars (which has no life). What do you see are the similarities between an earth-life model and a lifeless-Mars model? When was Mars at such a stage that it supported life - in so far as there's no evidence that it ever did? \n\n \n \nThere are numerous similarities in the geomorhology (sic) of Mars and Earth. Check it out yourself. Just do a search. February's (I believe) National Geographic also has an excellent article.\n\n \n The Earth and Mars are dissimilar as far as I understood; geomorphiclly speaking - as Mars is in effect 'dead' inside -whereas Earth is still nice and warm. But I'll have a look, ta.\n \n \n Where was this observed - what data of life on Mars has been found to test? (Or, for that matter, any other planet other than earth.) \n\n \n \nI guess we'll find out soon enough if there's any evidence of life.\n\n \n Sure, we can look. I have however a belief that the money would be better spent on other sciences, such as medical research. But that's just a belief that we should deal with he here and now rather than some pipe-dream of what might be.\n \n \nIs it science to have a hypothesis, and continue to hope for half a century? When does hope cease becoming science and becomes faith, in your view? \n\n \n \nContinue to hope? That's a warped view of science. Science on a deadline. Good thing not many share your perspective.\n\n \n When does science cease being science, and just wasting billions of dollars?\n \n \nTechnology advances, we're capable of doing things now we couldn't have imagined half a century ago, like land a rover on another planet. Should we have given up \"hope\" 10 years ago and said to heck with it?\n\n \n In many respects, yes. I would prefer to see people look after people, than rocks, but that's because I believe people are intrinsically worth more.\n \n \n For instance, why would aliens use radio waves? SETI is looking specifically for radio waves. Why is it science to hypothesise that aliens, if they existed, would follow the same technological pathways we did? (It doesn't sound very 'alien') \n\n \n \nWe're limited by our own understanding and technology. That should be pretty obvious to you. We can only hope to detect extra-terrestrial life it it exists and communicates within our current realm of scientific knowledge. If the \"aliens\" are transmitting in some form that we can't understand as yet, then I guess we're missing out.\n\n \n That's a lot of 'ifs'\n \n If they exist\n If they exist in an area we're searching\n If they use similar technology\n If they use similar or detectable language - who knows they could speak in 'static'.\n \n Hence I don't believe it really is science, by your definition or mine.\n \n \n I don't wish to discredit science per se, but simply put human knowledge back within the context of humanity... whereas you told earlier of some drive to get beyond the humanity \n\n \n \nScience is a human endeavour, that's undeniable, and with that comes human error and emotion. \n\n \n Indeed, that's why I don't set it up as the over-arching belief system in my life. I prefer 'perfection'\n \n \nI do feel we need to strive to eliminate human biases, whether they be racial, sexual, religious, etc... from the scientific process.\n\n \n Do they do this? I know studies of evolutionary science are quite tainted with sexism, less so now with racism, but it's still there too...\n Currently there's a book (which, admittedly I've not read)\n \"Race And Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction \"\n \n by Milford Wolpoff, University of Michigan and Rachel Caspari, University of Michigan \"Race and Human Evolution is a far-ranging account by leading researchers in the field that describes the latest scientific evidence and the conflicting theories about human evolution.\" \n \n http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/pe...y/0-8133-3546-9 *\n \n \n \n Enabled our continued survival? That's a value-laden statement if ever there was one, and typical of the pro-science debaters I've come across - that ultimate faith in man. I have mentioned that you and others put scientists on a pedestal that is just simply unworkable a belief... man without his foibles. \n\n \n \nAs oppossed (sic) to ulitmate faith in an invisible supernatural being? A being that works through man to ensure man's continued survival? Yep, I guess that's my value. What a shame to only be typical.\n\n \n I make no bones about having a belief system and a value system based on Christianity. I think however, as we are both in agreement about the foibles of man, then holding man up as the be-all and end-all of knowledge is rather silly. (unless you have another source for knowledge - say, aliens?)\n \n On a side issue here, too, and this is more of a personal feeling... I find it odd that they spend $$$ looking for aliens, and yet anytime that one is spotted - granted by some West Virginian coal miner, or the like, the scientists debunk this. The 'evidence' of a visitation is derrided. So, they get to continue to spend $$$ of dollars, so the experts have a job.\n \n \nAgain, where have I put any scientist on a pedestal? Where have I stated that scientists are without \"foibles\". This is your perception, not mine, I would never make such a statement.\n\n \n You have by default, as you hold up science as the potential for all of life's answers. You choose this science over God as the ultimate source.\n \n \nMy idea of science, and this is based on my world-view, is that science is a noble pursuit, so long as it does not take precedence over attempting to be close to God. I don't believe this statement of faith needs to be supported by evidences, as it is a statement of faith. \n\n \n \nGood thing. Ain't faith great!\n\n \n Why do you think faith, based on God's commandments is inferior to foible-filled science?\n \n \n This is at the core I am interested in, studying ideas. Your ideas, you believe are rational-logical, but are largely based on faith... faith in science in general, faith in particular scientists, faith that when science acts on faith (e.g. aliens), it still is science. \n\n \n \nAgain, while I see your point, it's \"typical of believers\" to try and point out that scientists also act on \"faith\".\n\n \n Why not? I've seen so many debates that derride Christians for not having any brains because they state that they have faith. I am simply putting science under the same scruitiny - of epistemology.\n \n One of the most common is the question - how can religion be true when there's so many of them...\n \n To which I retort - how can evolution be true, when there's so many of them?\n \n \nThe only faith I see in science is faith in your fellow man to follow the rules of scientific procedure. It's impossible for me to test every hypothesis and perform every experiment myself in order to ascertain its veracity. As such, I do place faith in the fact that I haven't been deceived. I don't see it as faith in science, but rather, more of a faith in my fellow man.\n\n \n Have I directed your gaze at any feminist critiques of science? I'm not sure that I have. They deal with science in a scientific manner and show huge gender bias in science. Your faith in science is not so well placed... and you are in a way, more correct than you realise when you say 'faith in my fellow man', because according to feminist research, science is dominated by males.\n \n \nScience itself is based on the ability to support a claim with repeatable, physical proof. I realize this gets hazy in certain \"soft sciences\" and in the realm of nuclear physics and chemistryfor example, however, the conclusions drawn and theories presented are for the most part based on repeatable experimentation, and in the above instances where direct observation is not possible, extrapolation and inference.\n \n Waxy\n\n \n Repeatble proofs can be wrong. I will have to paraphrase from \"Chaos\" by Gleick as I can't find my copy around, and therefore am going off memory.\n \n Suppose we have a scientist asked to describe the behaviour of a newly discovered bacteria, which for the purposes of this rant, I'll call \"Species 1138\".\n \n He ('cause it's most likely a fella), sits down with his microscope and dish and looks at the bacteria. He then might make comments about the way the bacteria 'act', with notations about lab conditions and how the bacteria were kept etc.\n \n He publishes the work.\n \n A lab in Germany, one in the UK, one in New Zelanad, and one in the USA all get a shipment of Species 1138. They each observe the behaviour under similar conditions and each note that their observations are the same as those made in Sydney.\n \n It is published by Nature \"Species 1138 is a vibrant species of Bacteria.... labs around the world confirm ...blah blah...\"\n \n The experiment was repeatable. Anyone with a batch of Species 1138 can observe it.\n \n The experiment is wrong.\n \n To observe Species 1138 each observer uses a light to illuminate the sample. Species 1138 are photo-sensitive. How they are 'normally' is different to how they are - when observed. They 'normally' aren't so vibrant.\n \n The observer has affected the observation.\n \n It's an interesting book, \"Chaos\" with some other examples of obeserver affected observations. It reminds us of the old saying \"If a tree falls in an empty forest, does it make a noise\"... and as far as Gleick is concerned, the answer is 'no'.\n \n The most basic assumptions we do everyday, unconsciously.\n \n \n * a book which deals with notions of evolution that have been influenced by ideas on race.\n Thus...\n \n \"The recent African-origin model championed by many genetic researchers relies on genetic findings that fit just as easily into a contrasting multiregional model. That is, populations of H. sapiens living in different parts of Africa, Asia, and Europe interbred enough over at least the past 1 million years to evolve collectively as a single species. The various populations around the world derived from even older ancestors of H. sapiens in this scenario.\n \n Practitioners of what has been dubbed anthropological genetics now operate with a sense of caution and a hunger for better explanations of how evolutionary forces produce genetic diversity among individuals and groups.\n \n \"A lot of us have been too eager to assume that a strict out-of-Africa model is correct because it's compatible with the genetic data, without considering that the data also fit with the multiregional theory,\" says anthropologist John H. Relethford of the State University of New York at Oneonta. \"It's time to go back to the drawing board on this issue.\"\n \n A fundamental conflict between the two current theories--each of which has several proposed variations on its theme--lies in their differing assumptions about the evolutionary significance of genetic differences among individuals and populations, Relethford asserts. DNA analyses appear unable to determine which perspective proves superior, he says.\"\n \n http://www.findarticles.com/cf_dls/...1/article.jhtml",

   "You are confident that science will provide the answers. You have faith in tha ability of science. Science and progress, faith in man. It is part of your belief system, this faith.\n\n \n Not true. I believe science to be the best tool at mankind's disposal. I DON'T believe that it can provide ALL the answers.\n \n \nYou've also displayed faith that when those scientists talk, they do so with authority - such as in out 'footprints' discussion, where-by, without stated evidence, you just hope that he is an expert in fields other than that which he credits himself. Your mind adds to the details given. You kind of 'fill in the holes' in the argument - based on this faith.\n \n Secondly, I think you're trying to draw a distinction between faith and belief which won't work, in this context. In the concept of aliens, scientists, as far as I'm aware, have no actual proof that aliens exist, so what other kind of belief is left?\n\n \n I don't know how else to state differences between belief/faith vs. hypothesis, so I won't continue to do so. I think I've been very clear.\n \n \nSimply not true. You just assume this to be true, because you don't believe in Jesus or angels (I am making a guess here). People have seen and spoken with angels throughout history.\n\n \n I'll leave this one. Start a different thread if you want to press it. \n \n I did speak to Elvis yesterday though, he said everything's fine, not to worry.\n \n \nYou draw distinctions between faith and belief -when that belief is not based on fact - as in I believe the USA to exist - for even though I've not been there, I've reason to believe. What other basis for 'belief' then do scientists have?\n \n I'll tell you.\n \n Scientists believe in statistics.\n X amount of planets.\n We know one of them is inhabited.\n Therefore others might be. Here, 'might' refers to faith.\n \n So, based on that flimsy premis they then conjecture, that if we had radio, they must have had radio. So they get billions of dollars to go looking for the signs of these aliens. Then they also begin to speculate about what they might look like. We even send them an invitation to come and see us.\n\n \n Might DOES NOT  equal faith. How can you not see that? \n \n No scientist says \"I have faith in the existance of aliens\", and no believer says \"God might exist\". Is that a clear enough analogy for you?\n \n Speculating on what aliens may look like isn't high on my list of \"legitimate\" science. However, use use of probabilities and statistics in not in any way unscientific, and as I've stated, we can only hope to discover evidence that is within our current realm of understanding. You put it as a simple if A is white then B must be white scenario. That's false, and misleading. Simply put, we only have A, so we use A and hope that \"they\" also have A. Pretty straight forward.\n \n \nYou seem like an intelligent person (I don't know if you're a bloke or a sheila), why do you think that that sort of endeavour is worthy of 'science'?\n\n \n Bloke. It is exploration and an attempt to understand that which we don't know. That is the heart of what science is all about. If not, I'd still be on a wind swept island off the coast of Europe, for fear that sailing out into the ocean meant falling off the Earth.\n \n Waxy",

   "Here you make an assumption again. I would credit a hunter-gatherer as an expert on tracks. No need to have a PhD. However, leaving aside your obsession with degree qualifications, a biologist might have specialised in dentition, and I would not suggest that this would qualify them to give expert comment on tracks. You simply assume that he is a biologist who\n a) studied tracks or animal locomotion (in his degree)\n and\n b) geology\n as he comments on both.\n \n If he'd grown up in the bush, with frequent recourse to hunting, I'd have accepted him as an 'expert' on tracks.\n\n \n If I would have stated he was bushman and was an \"expert\" on tracks, you would have dismissed him as having no formal training and not knowledgable on the subject of dinosaurs.\n \n That aside, a degree in biology does cover animal locomotion, maybe not in exhaustive detail, but I'd guessing it's pretty safe to say that someone with a degree in biology has a better understanding of locomotion than someone without. As I pointed out, he left much of the geological work to others with specific training in the field.\n \n \nAs it stands you just make an assumption about these qualifications, and I can't, as I've not seen the evidence... Funny that you're the evolutionist basing your beliefs on faith, and I'm the creationist demanding to see the evidence.\n\n \n Please tell me what type of evidence of his qualifications you would like to see. You've already stated that degrees are irrelevent to you, so just what is it you want? What would it take for you to accept his word as being correct, or at least, worthy of respect?\n \n \nHe has published numerous articles, therefore he is an expert, is the argument you make now. Let's again look to what he did when fresh out of university, he stated he was a biologist. Full stop, nothing else. He then studied the tracks, and has published on them. You raise him to 'expert', when right from the beginning he fails to live up to this.\n\n \n Publishing numerous articles represents the ongoing study of an issue and therefore an increased knowledge of it. You can't publish the same paper umpteen times, there has to be new and relevent information. He studied the tracks for years, consulted others, and after that period, his position remains the same. Therefore regardless of his \"expert\" status as a new grad, his work has stood up to the criticism and examination of other \"experts\".\n \n \nYou try the 'numbers' game... a lot of people agree, therefore it's true, a lot of articles written, therefore they're true.\n\n \n See above.\n \n \nIt is because you are giving him abilities that he has not stated. He quite simply says ... student of biology. To you that means he's qualified to give expertise not only on track formation, but geology as well. In fact, you've retrospectively given him the mantle of expert. If he's been studying tracks 50 years, or so, I won't specify a specific time, he could be said to be an expert... but fresh out of university, he made these conclusions, and he's not wavered. He was, then, an expert from day 1 (according to you).\n\n \n Again, I would ask you if you've actually read the article. \n \n No specific time to being an expert? So that rules out a new grad?\n \n I pity every new grad out there, because they are obviously fools until they are what 50? \n \n Furthermore, I never stated he was an expert from day one, YOU DID. I stated that he formed a conclusion after doing research. The results of which were affirmed by several independent workers. I'm not sure when he was granted special \"expert\" status. Why don't you tell me?\n \n \nQuite clearly you are arguing that, aside from being a lone voice on the issue, other people have come to the same conclusions, you even suggested most creationists, but fail to site any evidence to support that later claim. I am still waiting. It is all well and good of you to try to suggest something about the minds of creationists, but I'm afraid that mind-reading is not my forte.\n\n \n I'm limited as much by interest in the issue as time Montalban. I don't have time to cite and reference a million geology papers and textbooks. (As a side note, the claim is generally dismissed as ludicrous, and has received very little attention from main stream science.) Nor do I have time to cite Creationist sources. I gave you my reasons and evidence for believing the claim.\n \n \nAre they given to making the same just-so arguments he makes? Just because he's no expert, and writes a dozen articles, doesn't make him any more an expert. Others doing the same thing, if that is what is happening, equally adds no weight to the argument. 1 x1 x1 x1 is still one, no matter how many 1's you add to it, it just doesn't get bigger.\n\n \n See my above response about research and publishing. Have you ever researched or published anything?\n \n \nWhat qualifications do they have? What writings have they presented? Are the people making the claims about man-made tracks less qualified? You seem to think so.\n\n \n I think it's been proven. Again, I have read the site and many of the links, have you?\n \n \nIndeed, a just-so statement was made, and accepted by you unless you are prepared to show me the creationist sites you've read this on.

You say that there's no qualification to being a track expert, so how are you going to figure out which creationists to ask?\n\n \n I've stated several factors that lead to one being viewed as an expert, it's you that has issues with the term, not me.\n \n \nNot at all. I've already dealt with this statement of his, and found it rather naive for him to think that any right-thinking person would believe it to be so... it is the type of thing you believe - that a scientist is above personal bias.\n \n Logic says this fella is a biologist with an evolutionists bent.

It just seems too arrogant.\n\n \n Arrogance? Like refusing to believe a man's word because you know better?\n \n \nAs I said earlier, if a creationist scientist comments outside his field, he is lampooned.

Is that your own experience?\n \n Again, read the article, he bases the geology portion on consultation with several geologists, I'm not sure whether they're experts or not.\n \n \nHe said some of the tracks were dinosaur tracks, but also some were forged, and some were geological depressions.

Which opinion is closer to the truth?\n \n \nThat science is uncertain is a non-sequitor.(sic)\n\n \n non se\u00b7qui\u00b7tur P Pronunciation Key (nn skw-tr, -tr)\n n. \n An inference or conclusion that does not follow from the premises or evidence.\n A statement that does not follow logically from what preceded it.\n \n Look at the Uncertainty Principe.. :-)\n \n http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p08.htm\n \n But really, take note of \"Because of the scientific and philosophical implications of the seemingly harmless sounding uncertainty relations, physicists speak of an uncertainty principle,\"\n \n Note 'philosophy.'\n \n \"The Uncertainty Principle \n The position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrarily high precision. There is a minimum for the product of the uncertainties of these two measurements. There is likewise a minimum for the product of the uncertainties of the energy and time.\"\n \n http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/uncer.html\n \n It is a science that recognises uncertainty. Is this then a branch of science that you condemn as practicing illogic assumptions (you described it as a non-sequitur). :-)\n \n \nThat it does not rely on the absolute faith in its abilities to divine the truth allows detractors to use its own incredulity against it. Only the detractors themselves don't want their own ideas subject to the same level of critique.\n\n \n Really? DO apply the same level of critique to the notion of God. Your indignation is so totally misplaced. Let science disprove/prove God. You know it can't be done, therefore your notion of 'same level of critique' is unscientific.\n \n \nYes, scientists have faith that \"not having faith\" will produce the right answer. Yes, sometimes things can be confusing or unreproducible (as is the case in chaos dynamics). No, that does not mean that science is unable to function.\n\n \n I never said science is 'unable to function'. I said science functions at a level less than absolute truth - mostly because it is a man-made system, and men are fallible.\n \n By the way, I again draw your attention to Waxy saying that Gleick is illogical in his method. You fail to see criticisms from your own side. Either you are right, or he is wrong, but either way, attack the Christian. :-)\n \n \nIn chaos theory, while individual trials may produce drastically different results, non-linear dynamics still can be studied in a statistical sense. This is where computation power of today's computers come into play. It's why Gleick has a fractal on his cover. To say that science isn't working then is just to be ignorant of the methodology: science just isn't working in the traditional way the public thinks science *should* work. However, the same \"values\" of the scientific method are applied: and they are applied dispassionately.\n\n \n Again you are putting words in my mouth with regards to science. Note I have said many times I've nothing against science per se. I just believe that you should never raise it to the level it has been - as the senior source of truth.\n \n Secondly, what statistical 'sense' can be made for the observations of bacteria that are made by scientists in the example I gave? How have they over-come their own influence to make these statistics?\n \n \nThis can be compared to directly with someone who lets religious faith inform them about the physical world. For them, the determinism is simply a product of an Almighty Being that can reveal and cause at the Almighty Being's will. There are no tests in place to determine whether this makes any sense.\n\n \n What?\n \n \nIf science makes any pretences on this sort of worldview it is only with regards to the physicality of the claim: that is science is interested strictly in that which is observable. If you believe that God is observable in the scientific sense then you are going to necessarily clash with scientists who do not rely on the worldview of the above paragraph to do anything.

I'd hold it against them, but I don't think it's worth it. They simply don't have anything to add to a conversation with myself.\n\n \n You've used a lot of words to say very little. Are you American? :-)\n \n What on earth are you talking about when referring to people who rely on a world-view to believe anything? Are you talking about those scientists influenced by the philosophy of materialism? Or of Nazi science, or Marxist science? Or Radical Lesbian Feminist Science?\n \n In the early 1970s a group of radical feminists went so far as you science to suggest that it was physically impossible for a woman to achieve sexual orgasm whilst having penetrative sex. Even if the woman experienced an orgasm, she was said to be deceiving her self.... \"That even in a woman?s sexuality, there is deceit on the part of men, and complacency on the part of some women\" in Koedt, A. \"The Myth of Vaginal Orgasm.\" in Koedt, A. & Levine, E. & Rapone, A., (eds.). (1973). \"Radical Feminism\". Quadrangle Books, New York, p204\n \n They had an agenda, and had the science to back it up. Is this the sort of thing you were accusing religion of?",

   "This is my first time returning to the forums since I was last here in October. And to try and bring this topic back to focus, \"Noah's Flood, fact or fiction?\" I'm going to copy and paste a quote from Lurch (his very name sends creationists running for the hills on this forum) from a topic created last year. I'm doing this because it seems that looking at previous posts for evidence is something someone isn't willing to do.\n \n \"In 1909 the schooner Wyoming was launched from the Percy & Small shipyard in Bath, Maine. She was the state-of-the art in wooden hulled shipbuilding. She was a six masted schooner and, at 329 ft., the longest ship with an all wood keel and hull ever built. She was the last of nine wooden hulled, six-masted schooners built between 1900 and 1909, and one of seven built by Percy & Small. All were 300 ft. or more in length. They were all state-of-the art.\n \n The Wyoming had 90 steel crossbraces. Even while she was yet on the drawing boards the marine engineers who designed and built her knew from experience with shorter ships that the length of the Wyoming would exceed the structural limits of wood. For this reason they attempted to defeat, or at least support, the laws of physics and the principles of marine engineering with steel. It was to no avail. Not even the steel bracing could prevent the flexing and twisting that resulted in the separation of the hull planking. The Wyoming required constant pumping, as did her sister ships. The Wyoming leaked from the day she hit the water until the day, 14 years later, when she foundered and broke up off of Monomoy Island while riding out a storm at anchor.\n \n It is said that she could be seen to snake (movement of the bow and stern from side to side in relation to the midship) and hog (movement of the bow and stern up and down in relation to the midship) while underway. The action of the waves, in even calm seas, caused the planking to be sprung beyond the capabilities of any calking that could be devised. The Wyoming and her sisters were used, for the most part, for short, close-in coastal hauls, generally in sight of land. At the first sign if inclement weather, they could run for port. The Wyoming served for several years as a coal hauler, as did several of her sisters.\n \n I have always had a great love for windjammers. I have some very expensive books that deal with the minutia of their construction and for years my hobby was to build full rigged wooden models. I spent hours climbing over the decks of the U.S.S. Constitution in Charleston Navy Yard, admiring her construction. The Wyoming must have been a beautiful vessel. But she was a beautiful anachronism. At about 300 ft. the structural capabilities of wood were exceeded beyond the abilities of engineering and design to remedy\n \n Few other ships of this size were built of wood. One exception was the four-masted medium clipper barque, Great Republic built in 1853. She is sometimes reported as the longest wooden ship ever build with a length of 334 feet, but more usually she it is claimed that she was 325 feet. The Great Republic also had 90 steel cross braces, 4 inches wide, 1 inch thick, and 36 feet long. Nevertheless, she sprung her hull in a storm off of Bermuda. She was abandoned when the water in the hold reached 15 feet.\n \n And yet, creationists want me to believe that a 450 ft. (minimum) vessel of ALL wood construction was able to withstand a storm of 40 days and then remain at sea for almost a year, manned by only eight people, without the efficient pumps of the turn of the century, calked with nothing more than \"pitch inside and out\". Not to mention the overwhelming necessity of the limited crew to feed and water thousands of animals and to muck out thousands of pens (and then carry the result of the mucking up two decks in order to throw it overboard). When was there time for pumping (24 hours a day if the above is any indication) and the constant recalking in a futile attempt to stem the flow.\n \n You may perceive this as an argument from incredulity similar to those that are so typical of creationists, but I just can't believe such a fairy tale. Experience with real wooden ships sailing in real oceans indicates that Noah's ark would not have survived many days of the 40 day storm.\n \n My opinion of Noah's ark is that that boat don't float.\"",

   "\n My opinion of Noah's ark is that that boat don't float.\"\n\n \n Not to mention the captain has to be Jewish. Now, which is the greater stretch: an dimensionally-challenged boat, or a nomadic, desert-dwelling goat-herder whose idea of water was a shimmering oasis? Noah may know what a camel is, but had never heard of a keel. Can't we be honest enough to acknowledge that this story is only one of many far older? Why do Christian insist the Jewish account is the only true story? \n \n Yet, these facts mean nothing to them, and as far as miracles go, these two--the boat and the pilot--are pretty minor. If you can suspend your disbelief enough to imagine a pair of kangaroos hopping on the boardwalk it isn't hard to convince yourself that the pitch used to waterproof the boat was more than adequate. Once your mind becomes comfortable with miracles, it's no great leap to visualize two lions walking behind two lambs up the ramp and bedding down beside each other, with the lions never so much as looking twice on them as a next meal. Do we think that a person who holds those unthinking beliefs will be swayed with logic in boat engineering or in piloting skills?",

   "...Why cant any bit of evolution, of humans evolving into another species, be detected or measured....\n\n We can. Due to a change in diet, the modern human jaw is much smaller than that of our ancestors. As a result, it is too small to hold the \"normal\" component of teeth -- wisdom teeth quite often grow wrong, sometimes come in sideways, sometimes, like mine, don't even completely erupt through the gums. In my case, I had many problems with gum infections as food would get caught in the piece of gum still covering my (now gone) wisdome teeth. Wisdom teeth cause more problems for modern humans, problems that ourweigh the benefits of having them. And, sure enough, there are people who are born without wisdom teeth.\n \n The appendix is another interesting structure. It is clearly homologous to the ceacum in other primates. The ceacum helps digest a mainly leafy diet high in cellulose. However, because the human diet is more varied, there is no reason for the appendix. In fact, contrary to what AnswersInGenesis would have us believe, the human appendix serves no function that is not done by other parts of the human body. In fact, it is quite a detriment -- appendicitis used to be a common cause of death before modern medicine. Now, not only is the appendix much, much smaller than the ceacum on other primates, but many people are born without an appendix.\n \n Just a couple of examples of evolution in action. As you said, we should be able to measure small changes, and these are, indeed, small changes.",

While it is undoubtedly true that plutonium was produced, there is none there now. I'll say that again to make sure that you understand. No plutonium was found at Oklo.\n \n The site also makes this remark:\n \nThis particular group of reactors was, incredibly moderated using --water. The first modern nuclear reactors used graphite and cadmium rods to moderate their reactions.\n\n Bizarre! Most nuclear reactors in the United States are moderated using water. In fact, only in the former communist bloc countries was graphite used as the moderator.\n \nThere are at least six zones of depleted uranium (usually means mined)with plutonium as a by product! You've got to really be trying to manufacture plutonium--its a complicated process.\n\n Nice demonstration of ignorance. \"depleted uranium\" does not mean \"mined.\" It means that it has been used for nuclear fuel and the U235 has been depleted. And while the process that produces plutonium is complicated, it isn't unusual. The process is known as a fission reaction. In any fission reaction where U238 is present (that is all of them), one of the by-products is plutonium. It can't be avoided. Breeder (fast) reactors just produce more plutonium. They also surround the core with uranium carbide that doesn't take part in the reactor but in which some U238 is converted to plutonium.",

Answer those two and I'll have lots more\n\n \n \n Well to answer the first question...not all evidence has been erased. In fact there is quite a bit of evidence for the flood. How do you explain remains of crabs and other sea creatures found in the same area inland as dinousaurs and other land dwelling creatures. The Grand Canyon is also evidence for the flood. A canyon of the same type was formed when Mt. St. Helens erupted when the snow and ice melted at the top and rushed down the slope. Even evolutionists have admitted that it looks just like the Grand Canyon, only on a smaller scale, and that it appears to have been created over millions of years but in fact it only took a couple of hours. For you to say that there isnt any evidence is a very ignorant thing because there is just as much evidence or more supporting the flood as there are people and things that dont support it. \n \n To answer the second question...not all bones are fossilized. Bones do decompose. Also perhaps people just havent been looking in the right places. No one knows for sure where the arks true resting place is let alone the paths the animals took going away from the ark so there is no way anyone could start looking for bones even if they did exist.

   "So you honestly believe that with the technology available at the time, Noah constructed a monstrous synthetic habitat large enough to hold two of every creature on earth? Complete with enough aquatic capacity to hold two of every ocean creature, including whales and sharks? With enough travel speed to cover the entire globe in time to pick up two of every animal, from the burrowing frogs of the african desert to the Polar bears of Antarctica?\n \n And that this vessel was also large enough to carry a supply of food adequate for so many hundreds of millions of animals? And that the waste disposal systems were adequate to handle such a volume of waste?\n \n I'm sorry, but anyone with even a shred of credibility must take the story of Noah and his ark as nothing more than an interpretation and adaption of an ages old story. To interpret it as the literal truth is beyond belief.\n\n \n \n If you were to read Genesis 6:7 you will see that nothing is mentioned about creatures of the sea being destroyed so you quip about whales and sharks and aquatic capacity is proven wrong right there.\n \n Also Genesis 6:20 says that the animals were to come to Noah so Noah didnt have to travel the whole earth collecting animals. What you said about that doesnt even make any sense because if he had to collect all of the animals as he floated around the globe there wouldnt be any animals because they would all have drowned in the floodwaters. \n \n To those who believe it is just a story, it is because, if you have read the actual account yourselves, youre interpreting it of your own knowledge.

If there was any evidence of a kangaroo migration from Turkey to Australia we know exactly where we would need to look. And in fact, the route goes through some of the more excavated areas of the world, so we'd almost certainly have found any remains by now.\n\n \n \n You're right. The fossils I'm talking about weren't found in the same layers. Rather single fossils were found in multiple layers extending across the layers. You can't tell me fossils waited around for millions of years for multiple layers to form over them without any sort of decay. Just explain this all of the different sections of this article to me: http://www.layevangelism.com/advtxbk/sections/sect-10/sec10-5.htm. Just go to that website and read and explain it all to me. The article makes itself quite clear.\n \n Also the Bible does not say the ark landed on Mt. Arafat in Turkey. It actually says that it came to rest in the mountains of Ararat.

If you want to bring up a new argument than just do it, don't pretend that the argument that I refuted wasn't the one you said.\n \n Having refuted your first bit of evidence, I'll now refute this one. You get a fossil extending through multiple layers when you get a plant growing on sedimentary rock. The roots dig down through the layers, then the normal fossilization process happens, giving you a fossil that cuts through layers. You'll note that you only see this with plants, you don't get animal fossils doing this, which is further evidenece that it's a result of growth through rock, rather than a flood.\n \n \n\n Also the Bible does not say the ark landed on Mt.

Sue me. That fact still remains that Mt. Ararat is in Turkey, and so we do know where the ark landed. The rest of my argument stands.\n \n BTW, do you concede that your Grand Canyon argument has no basis? Please don't just keep throwing out new arguments without acknowledging that you're done with the old ones. In your following post you say that there's lots of evidence for creationism.

   "You overlook the small fact that creationism has been generally viewed as a fact for much longer than evolution ever has.\n\n \n Not really as I was not addressing that issue. But as you have raised it lets think about it anyway. A young earth as interpreted from Genesis was/is a belief whose factual basis is derived solely from the writings in the Bible. It would have been accepted as a given truth in the same way as the way the old testament describes people who lived for several hundreds of years. Still, there is no other evidence to support these facts, except that derived from a single source, the Bible. In this regard it is a very different \"fact\" to the fact that evolution of life occurs, which can be supported by a multitude of observations.\n \n I also think it is odd to infer that just because something has been known/believed for a long time makes it more valid than a \"younger\" point of view. Dogma can be a risky thing to rely on as an absolute.\n \n \nThe original Bible translated into English in 1611 by King James gives no acknowledgement of all other religious/faith based viewpoints. Only the one which lines up with everything that the Bible says. Also there are two valid areas of science...creation and evolution. Both line up with science so both should be taught and both should be found in textbooks.\n\n \n The KJV Bible does not acknowledge other faith viewpoints (well, it does actually- Judasim for example) and in that regard it is quite similar to all Bibles. Not surprising considering the monotheisitc nature of Christianity. So I take your answer to my question:\n \n would you expect to find a bible without reference to God, or one that acknowledges all the other religious/faith based viewpoints on subjects the bible deals with?\n \n Is no.\n \n Now finally you say 2 valid lines of science- creation and evolution. Well, I see that as one valid line of science and one valid line of religious belief. Creationism in any form is not a science, it is an aspect of Christian belief. Vice-versa, evolution is not religion. We wouldn't put a chapter on radiometric dating in a RE textbook, and likewise it is a juxtaposition to place material on Creationism in a textbook covering life sciences and evolution.",
