   "I've been trying for a while now to wrap my head around the issue of the constitutionality of firearm registration and I have come to the conclusion that SCOTUS has not resolved it. Now I realize that 2nd. Amendment jurisprudence is still in its infancy, and there are still a lot of issues left unresolved by Heller and McDonald. But this registration issue was raised in both Heller and McDonald and I suggest we still have no clear answer. \n \n Heller: The D.C. gun laws in Heller made it a crime to possess an unregistered/unlicensed handgun, and it then banned registration and licensing of handguns. The SCOTUS majority dealt only with the issue of the actual ban. It sidestepped the issue of registration and licensing because Heller surrendered his argument that registration was unconstitutional: \n \n Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D. C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, III (2008)\n \n Thus, the issue of the constitutionality of registration schemes was left for another day.\n \n McDonald: In McDonald, the law in question was a registration and ban system similar to what D.C. had used-registration was required, and then a separate provision banned new registration and effectively banned possession of handguns. The primary issue was whether the 2nd. Amendment applied to the States, and that was clearly resolved in favor of incorporation. McDonald reached this result by arguing that the effective ban was unconstitutional. However, and likely because the issue was avoided in Heller, he made a separate argument that registration by itself is unconstitutional. The majority opinion written by Alito completely ignored the registration argument and made no comment on it whatsoever. Additionally, although Scalia and Thomas wrote concurring opinions they both ignored the registration issue. This effectively leaves the issue open once again, and for the moment there is no clear direction from the SCOTUS majority telling us whether registration would be constitutional or not.\n \n However, the minority justices have been busy attempting to build their own arguments for constitutionality of registration. Consider, for example, now-retired justices Stevens' comment on McDonald's claim that registration by itself is unconstitutional:\n \n To the extent that petitioners contend the city of Chicago's registration requirements for firearm possessors also, and separately, violate the Constitution, that claim borders on the frivolous. Petitioners make no effort to demonstrate that the requirements are unreasonable or that they impose a severe burden on the underlying right they have asserted.\n McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___ 081521, 57 (2010)\n \n Why is this unresolved issue important?\n \n Look at the following current registration statute under the ATF portion of the U.S. Code that establishes the National Firearms Registry and Transfer Record. Note how comprehensive the registration system is....\n \n 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5841 - Registration of firearms\n \n (a) Central registry\n \n The Secretary shall maintain a central registry of all firearms in the United States which are not in the possession or under the control of the United States. This registry shall be known as the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. The registry shall include -\n \n (1) identification of the firearm;\n \n (2) date of registration; and\n \n (3) identification and address of person entitled to possession of the firearm.\n \n (b) By whom registered\n \n Each manufacturer, importer, and maker shall register each firearm he manufactures, imports, or makes. Each firearm transferred shall be registered to the transferee by the transferor.\n \n (c) How registered\n \n Each manufacturer shall notify the Secretary of the manufacture of a firearm in such manner as may by regulations be prescribed and such notification shall effect the registration of the firearm required by this section. Each importer, maker, and transferor of a firearm shall, prior to importing, making, or transferring a firearm, obtain authorization in such manner as required by this chapter or regulations issued thereunder to import, make, or transfer the firearm, and such authorization shall effect the registration of the firearm required by this section.\n \n (d) Firearms registered on effective date of this Act\n \n A person shown as possessing a firearm by the records maintained by the Secretary pursuant to the National Firearms Act in force on the day immediately prior to the effective date of the National Firearms Act of 1968 shall be considered to have registered under this section the firearms in his possession which are disclosed by that record as being in his possession.\n \n (e) Proof of registration\n \n A person possessing a firearm registered as required by this section shall retain proof of registration which shall be made available to the Secretary upon request.\n \n That's a very comprehensive (read invasive) registration scheme. The penalties for failure to comply with this registration scheme are severe:\n \n 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5871 - Penalties\n \n Any person who violates or fails to comply with any provisions of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $10,000, or be imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\n \n Now understand that, for the moment, only the following firearms are covered under the above ATF National Registry scheme:\n \n U.S. Code 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845 Definitions\n \n For the purpose of this chapter -\n \n (a) Firearm\n \n The term \"firearm\" means\n \n (1) a shotgun having a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length;\n \n (2) a weapon made from a shotgun if such weapon as modified has an overall length of less than 26 inches or a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length;\n \n (3) a rifle having a barrel or barrels of less than 16 inches in length;\n \n (4) a weapon made from a rifle if such weapon as modified has an overall length of less than 26 inches or a barrel or barrels of less than 16 inches in length;\n \n (5) any other weapon, as defined in subsection (e);\n \n (6) a machinegun;\n \n (7) any silencer (as defined in section 921 of title 18, United States Code); and\n \n (8) a destructive device. The term \"firearm\" shall not include an antique firearm or any device (other than a machinegun or destructive device) which, although designed as a weapon, the Secretary finds by reason of the date of its manufacture, value, design, and other characteristics is primarily a collector's item and is not likely to be used as a weapon.\n \n (e) Any other weapon\n \n The term \"any other weapon\" means any weapon or device capable of being concealed on the person from which a shot can be discharged through the energy of an explosive, a pistol or revolver having a barrel with a smooth bore designed or redesigned to fire a fixed shotgun shell, weapons with combination shotgun and rifle barrels 12 inches or more, less than 18 inches in length, from which only a single discharge can be made from either barrel without manual reloading, and shall include any such weapon which may be readily restored to fire. Such term shall not include a pistol or a revolver having a rifled bore, or rifled bores, or weapons designed, made, or intended to be fired from the shoulder and not capable of firing fixed ammunition.\n \n And note that \"Silencer\" or \"Muffler\" is defined here:\n \n U.S. Code 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845 Definitions\n \n (24) The terms \"firearm silencer\" and \"firearm muffler\" mean any device for silencing, muffling, or diminishing the report of a portable firearm, including any combination of parts, designed or redesigned, and intended for use in assembling or fabricating a firearm silencer or firearm muffler, and any part intended only for use in such assembly or fabrication.\n \n So at present the definition of \"firearm\" for the registration scheme is limited to those unique firearms (sawed-off shotguns, machineguns, etc.) that were effectively taxed to death starting in the 1930s. \n \n The danger, however, is that this is not the only definition of the word \"firearm\" in the U.S. Code. In the general crimes title (Title 18), the following definition of \"firearm\" exists: \n \n U.S. Code 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 Definitions\n \n (3) The term \"firearm\" means\n \n (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive;\n \n (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon;\n \n (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or\n \n (D) any destructive device. Such term does not include an antique firearm\n \n Clearly this definition covers every \"firearm,\" including black powder firearms. This broader definition is used to cover general crimes committed with firearms (like possession by felons, armed career criminal violations, etc.)\n \n Here is my question: If a bill came before Congress tomorrow that took this broader definition of \"firearm\" in Title 18 and applied it to the National Registry in Title 26 to require complete intrusive registration of every firearm not controlled by the federal government, then is there any SCOTUS authority to say the change would be unconstitutional? I say not at present-for the only comments from justices one way or the other are in favor of constitutionality (thankfully, from minority opinions). \n \n Isn't this a real problem for people who do not favor registration? \n \n Anyone else have thoughts on this?",

   "I was under the impression that the Supreme Court issued a strict scrutiny ruling when it came to evaluating laws that potentially infringe on the Second Amendment, meaning the law has to be narrowly tailored to achieve a specific goal and be the least invasive method possible to achieve such a goal.\n \n I fail to see how a proposed law, attaching the broader definition of \"firearm\" to the NFA34 bill, would ever pass the strict scrutiny standard. I fail to see how it would even pass 4th Amendment challenges, because such a measure would easily violate the people's right to privacy and for a trivial reason.\n \n And then there's the issue regarding the Gun Owner's Protection Act of 1986, which specifically forbade the creation of any centralized federal registry of gun owners. So any such proposal would be violating the law that's already in place unless the previous law was repealed first.\n \n Also is the fact that the Supreme Court has made it clear that the Second Amendment is regarded the same as all the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, meaning the same protections (at least in theory) apply to it that apply to all the others. And since government can't compel people to acquire a license to exercise their specific religion, or pass a background check before consulting with a lawyer, or submitting fingerprints for running an online blog, or mandate the registration of every single muslim in the country, I foresee one hell of a wrangling being necessary in order to justify such a bill to the point that congress would actually pass it in the proposed manner.",

   "Speaking on Canada's gun registry. \n   The gun registry doesn't make us safer \n The key factor to consider when determining the fate of the federal long-gun registry is whether or not it prevents crime. That was its initial objective. That is how Jean Chretien's Liberal government justified the nearly $2-billion that has been spent on the project and a bureaucracy that continues to consume between $87-million (RCMP estimate) and $106-million (Canadian Taxpayers Federation estimate) annually. \n \n If the registry prevents murders and cuts down on other gun crimes such as robberies and armed drug deals, then there might be a case for keeping it -- might. Otherwise, there is no justification for the way it makes criminals of law-abiding gun owners. \n \n In fact, on the crime-prevention front, the registry has been an abject failure. \n\n Game, Set, and Match!",

   "Well I think that McDonald has answered part of the question when it declared the RKBA to be a \"fundamental\" right. This means the test now should be \"strict scrutiny.\" Here are a few examples of cases describing this test: \n \n \"Certain substantive rights we have recognized as \"fundamental\"; legislation trenching upon these is subjected to \"strict scrutiny,\" and generally will be invalidated unless the State demonstrates a compelling interest and narrow tailoring.\" Regents of University of Michigan v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 226 (1985) \n \n \"Thus [for example], the Fourth Amendment speaks only of \"unreasonable searches and seizures\" and of \"probable cause.\" These rights are \"fundamental,\" and we have held that in order to support legislative action the statute must be narrowly and precisely drawn and that a \"compelling state interest\" must be shown in support of the limitation. E. g., Kramer v. Union Free School District, 395 U.S. 621; Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618; [Page 212] Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89; Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398; NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449 .\" Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 211-212 (1973)\n \n \"(Where fundamental liberty interests are infringed) the statutory classification would have to be not merely rationally related to a valid public purpose but necessary to the achievement of a compelling state interest. E. g., Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 (1969); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967).\"  Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 455 (1972)\n \n But rights are not absolute in scope. Take, for example, freedom of religion. That right is written in absolute terms, but no one believes freedom of religion would protect a man from a murder charge if he engaged in human sacrifice. This is because the scope of all rights is limited, and no one will accept that human sacrifice would be a form of protected activity under the religious freedom clause. Therefore, strict scrutiny would not apply to a charge of murder for engaging in human sacrifice, and SCOTUS would declare that no protected constitutional right was \"infringed\" by a prosecution for murder. \n \n And so this is the question: Is freedom from registration protected by the RKBA? \n \n Right now the SCOTUS approved protected scope (or reach, if you will) of the RKBA is very limited. SCOTUS has not done much beyond saying the RKBA protects a right to have a handgun in the home for defense. Most importantly, SCOTUS did not limit the right here, and it very plainly said that it has not fully defined the scope of every activity the right protects or every activity the government is prohibited from doing. Obviously the scope will expand as new cases come before SCOTUS. But what troubles me is the issue of registration was put directly to SCOTUS in McDonald, the majority had a direct opportunity to declare registration by itself an unconstitutional infringement on the RKBA, and the majority dodged the issue entirely. We only find a now-retired dissenter addressing it, in passing, and in favor of the constitutionality of registration.\n \n Now this is a question of power and not wisdom. Set this aside for a moment the question of whether registration is wise or serves any useful purpose. I'm not asking whether Congress should try to create a mandatory registration of all firearms (I think it's a bad idea), I'm asking instead whether Congress constitutionally can try to do it.\n \n Right now I think the jury is still out on whether Congress can try it. SCOTUS has not said registration would violate any freedom the RKBA protects, and no one has yet argued to SCOTUS successfully that the amorphous right to \"privacy\" would provide a freedom from registration.\n \n Absent this then I see the only thing prohibiting mandatory registration is the anti-registration language in the Gun Owner's Protection Act. But this can be repealed easily enough. In fact, repealing this act does nothing to infringe on our RKBA, it only takes away the negative thou shalt not attempt the infringement language. No alleged infringement occurs until Congress goes further and tries to create the registry. Once that happens then we have to go to SCOTUS and hope it will agree that registration falls within the scope of liberty the 2nd. Amendment (or a general right to privacy) was designed to protect. How do you think people like Sotomayor would rule? Hopefully with no more than three others on her side is my answer. \n \n But we won't know unless and until we get there....\n \n Happy Thanksgiving everyone, including all those who live outside my country and do not enjoy all the freedoms I have inherited.",

SCOTUS has allowed prior restraints on these rights involving \"march permits\" and the like:\n \n [T]he Court has recognized that government, in order to regulate competing uses of public forums, may impose a permit requirement on those wishing to hold a march, parade, or rally, see Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569, 574-576 (1941). Such a scheme, however, must meet certain constitutional requirements. It may not delegate overly broad licensing discretion to a government official. See Freedman v. Maryland, supra. Further, any permit scheme controlling the time, place, and manner of speech must not be based on the content of the message, must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and must leave open ample alternatives for communication. See United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 177 (1983). Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 130 (1992)\n \n These types of permits (and the fee payments that go with them) are typically justified as giving the local government notice of the event and paying the cost of the government's police and administrative costs for the event. \n \n But note that the exercise of the rights mentioned here is in a \"collective\" sense.\n \n The second registration example involves the right to vote. Like free speech and assembly, the right to vote, and the principle of \"one man, one vote,\" is considered a \"fundamental right.\" But you must pre-register to vote, and the government can keep a registration list of whether or not you have voted. \n \n Yet these two examples and firearm ownership are like apple and oranges. March permits involve public property owned by the government that by its nature must be fairly rationed on a first come first serve basis when more than one group wishes to use the same public street or park on the same day, and the activity involved almost always involves a governmental presence (police, traffic control, etc.) to ensure safety. No government action is required for firearm ownership to fairly distribute limited resources or provide public safety when I have a gun in my closet. \n \n Similarly, voting by its very nature requires you to first pre-register and prove residency and then have your act of voting in each election recorded (unless you want to run for mayor of Chicago-where residency may not even be required for one candidate). This is because the act of voting, like marching to protest something, can only be exercised as part of a collective process, and the act of registration is required to ensure that everyone has an equal say in this collective process. If I do not register and thus attempt to \"vote early and vote often\" in the same election then my abuse of that voting right dilutes the same right of others to have their voice equally heard. My act of buying (or not buying) a firearm has no impact on the right of another to make the same choice, and so registration is not required to protect his right from dilution by my buying more than one gun. \n \n Thus-while marching, voting, and firearm ownership are all true personal, individual choices-voting and marching are rights we only use \"collectively\" while firearm ownership remains an individual right. It is the collective exercise of the right which requires (and thus permits) registration.",

A very different and important point!\n \n Daewoo has tried to argue that our Founding Fathers registered their firearms because of the 1792 Militia act. \n \n   Militia Act of 1792, \n IV. And be it further enacted, ...\n The officers to be armed with a sword or hanger, a fusee, bayonet and belt, with a cartridge box to contain twelve cartridges; and each private of matoss shall furnish themselves.... , and to be armed with a sword and pair of pistols, the holsters of which to be covered with bearskin caps.\n \n He calls this gun registration, and when pressed, he then had to say that the fusee, bayonet and belt were also registered as well! emoticon_smile\n \n My point is that our Founding Fathers totally distrusted government and would never have allowed the government to know where all firearms were, and who had them! Heck the Revolutionary War started when the their very own British Soldiers came to both Lexington and Concord to seize the powder stores, collecting weapons along the way! They would rather die fighting the Most Powerful Army the World had ever known, them instead of being disarmed! \n   George Mason \n [W]hen the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man, who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them; but that they should not do it openly, but weaken them, and let them sink gradually...I ask, who are the militia?

And even if you choose not to have a lawyer at all you are still required to register that fact by signing a form we call \"waiver of right to counsel.\" \n \n Registration in these examples is required because the right is aimed at limiting the power of government-specifically its power to deal with you in a criminal matter. The right to counsel is your declaration that when criminal issues arise you no longer wish to deal with the government directly and you demand that government deal with you from now on only through an authorized legal representative. This obviously requires you to tell government that you are exercising this power to restrict its access to you and you must also tell government who that representative is. Similarly, the corresponding 5th Amendment right to counsel before questioning and the right to remain silent with or without counsel present requires you to \"register\" your exercise of these rights with government. Again, these rights act to limit what government can and cannot do (question you further or stop asking questions)-and you must tell government that you are exercising these rights so government knows when to shut up. \n \n The common thread of all these examples is these rights are exercised only through direct contact with government, that government has duties and responsibilities which it owes to you that are triggered when you say \"I'm going to exercise this right,\" and that for this reason you must \"register\" your exercise of the right with your government. \n \n Can the same be said for the RKBA? Well here's part of the rub: Government has an affirmative duty to ensure that felons and other prohibited persons do not possess firearms, and government is the sole entity that has access to the confidential criminal record information of its citizens. This is the justification for background checks, which are of course forms of temporary registration (the dealer contacts the state police by computer and says \"Bryan wants to by a Kimber .45, here is his DoB and SS# and where he says he lives, can I sell him one?\" My record is checked and government approves or denies the sale).\n \n I think so long as we have laws that limit lawful firearm possession (no illegal aliens, no felons, no persons acquitted by reason of insanity, etc.) then the constitutional question is resolved in favor of allowing government to be told about an attempted firearm purchase and allowing government to first approve/deny the sale based upon my criminal record. \n \n The real question is whether government can retain that information and access it for purposes other than the immediate approval/denial of the sale-or require me to provide a status change update if I ever transfer the firearm or get one off the secondary market? That is the ultimate registration question, and it is the one SCOTUS has avoided so far. \n \n And listen, I think now-former Justice Powell comes very close on the legal issue involved: \"Petitioners make no effort to demonstrate that the requirements are unreasonable or that they impose a severe burden on the underlying right they have asserted.\" I think this is the framework SCOTUS will ultimately use. \n \n So if government wants to maintain a permanent register of my firearms, then can I show that the registration requirement is unreasonable or imposes a severe burden on the underlying RKBA? If yes, then it's unconstitutional. If not, then can I make a similar showing on a claim that the registration violates my general right to privacy?\n \n I do not have a clear indication of how SCOTUS will ultimately decide these issues.",

   "Bryan those are very loose definition of the idea of registration. I question if anyone would consider that Registration. Especially as compared to what the Gun controllers want gun registration to be. So I file objection to that definition. That is notification that one will participate in a Right, not registration to participate in a Guaranteed, Inalienable, Right! \n \n If that is registration then here is my registration! Government! I retain all of my Rights, and yield none of them to you! Or did I just notify them? \n \n If that is registration, then we have nothing to complain about! I register to participate in several Amendments! Now I want to register to tell government to keep my information out of any databases! emoticon_smile There! Full and totally complete registration! No? \n \n However, and conversely, I also registered for the draft, and my subsequent Military Service. They wanted all kinds of information to include my whole body! emoticon_smile\n \n We have a Social Contract that allows government to govern. In it, we were guaranteed specific Rights that were not to be trampled upon! Some infringement is allowed, we all get that, however, the Antis want to urinate all over our binding contract, and all over us to boot. \n \n I will also register with them (Or inform them) that I do not allow them to void that contract that they have with us, and with our government. Live by the law!!!!\n \n   Bill of Rights \nPreamble\n \n THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added:  And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution.\n \n Amendment II\n \n A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\n \n The declaration! A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State,\n \n The Restriction. the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\n \n Now the Antis want to pretend none of this exist, and play word games where we must justify to their satisfaction what constitutes an infringement, and then commit genocide on our Rights that I, and many others, hold sacred!\n \n Some lawyers too! I cry foul! \n \n Just how far are we expected to bend before we say enough is enough! One can only go so far while saying that one had a right, but the Government can take it away or just trample all over it just as long as some Anti-gun judge, says it is OK!\n \n \n*58 senators and 251 members of the House of Representatives have filed a joint brief in favor of McDonald arguing for \"Fundamental Right\" status and incorporation under both \"due process\" and \"P&I\"\n \n *38 states have filed a joint brief arguing for 2nd. Amendment \"Fundamental Right\" right status and incorporation against the states, but interestingly only through the \"due process\" clause of the 14th. Amendment.\n\n So who is being unreasonable? I demand what is mine, under our Contract! The U.S. Constitution! The Supreme Law of the Land! I suspect many others will as well! We will expect no less than 100% compliance!\n \n I'll register that too! emoticon_smile",

   "No. My argument is there is no other way in order to accomplish a fair election! A very different and important point!\n \n Daewoo has tried to argue that our Founding Fathers registered their firearms because of the 1792 Militia act. \n \n   Militia Act of 1792,  \n He calls this gun registration, and when pressed, he then had to say that the fusee, bayonet and belt were also registered as well! emoticon_smile\n \n My point is that our Founding Fathers totally distrusted government and would never have allowed the government to know where all firearms were, and who had them! Heck the Revolutionary War started when the their very own British Soldiers came to both Lexington and Concord to seize the powder stores, collecting weapons along the way! They would rather die fighting the Most Powerful Army the World had ever known, them instead of being disarmed! \n   George Mason \n\n \n No, I argued that the firearms \"counts\" (since you were not bright enough to understand the term \"census\" when used outside the context of the ten year US census) that were ordered by our first 4 defense secretaries, 2 of which included door to door questioning and ALL of which included criminal penalties for failure to comply/dishonesty amounted to firearms registration.\n \n You can lie all you want about it (we are used to it, go ahead), but the simple fact of the matter is that during the early part of this nations history, when the militia was considered our primary defense force, they kept track of who had weapons and what weapons they had. It was the only way to get any kind of idea of what kind of military strength they could actually expect to be able to muster if we went to war.\n \n You have been provided links supporting all of this, including links to nations first firearms census, ordered by George Washington's secretary of defense and approved and signed by George Washington. Same thing happened under Jefferson. \n \n Sorry, but there is NOTHING in the constitution that would prevent them from requiring firearms registration, You folks argument that registration could lead to confiscation so it must be unconstitutional is childish and illogical. The fact that registration could conceivably be abused as a tool for confiscation does not make registration unconstitutional. \n \n The \"right to privacy\" is an interesting argument. I think it is pretty foolish to think there is some possibility that a court is going to uphold that, but it is an interesting academic thought exercise. Before you jump up and down and insist that the right to privacy SHOULD protect us from registration, keep in mind that we live in a country where to get on a plane you have to let some loser from the TSA fondle your testicles. \"Right to privacy\" is not getting a very good run here in the good old US of A lately.",

You have to submit to one now if you buy from a dealer.\n\n \n This would almost certainly be unconstitutional. Requiring a permit like this to exercise an individual, fundamental right? I have trouble imagining how that could NOT be unconstitutional.\n \n The background check we have now is unconstitutional and should be done away with. We have been doing them for years, it has cost us billions of dollars, and they can not show that even one person has actually be kept form purchasing a gun. If somebody fails the background check they go buy a gun elsewhere. We have actually reached the point in this nation where black market or gray market guns are cheaper than fully legal ones. \n \n IMO background checks essentially boil down to trying to stuff the genie back in the bottle. I think they are a bad idea and if we actually did institute them there would be some pretty bad unintended consequences. Right now, even for criminals, \"normal\" firearms are easy to come by. They are all over the place. If they have to actually go to the trouble of smuggling them into the country for sale to criminals, it would be foolish to smuggle in semi automatic weapons where there is a world full of dirt cheap military weaponry out there. In most of Africa a glock will set you back $600 or more if you can even find one. You can buy a fully automatic Krinkov (compact AK more or less) with an entire case of loaded magazins for under $50. If you were a smuggler looking to buy weapons abroad for sale on the US black market, you would be a fool to not go with the military stuff. \n \n The idea that we are going to pass some kind of legislation that takes guns out of the hands of criminals is foolish. Criminals, by definition, do not obey the law. Pass all the laws you want and it is not going to disarm criminals. Pass the WRONG laws and you may well end up arming them a lot better than they are now.",

They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power.\"\n\n Personally, I think we are seeing his words of warning in action today!

   "You mentioned the right to counsel and that is one that is not exercised collectively but does require registration (the same also goes for the 5th.

The only 'registration' required is a suit or complaint. \n \n \nThe right to counsel is an individual right protected in the 5th. and 6th amendments, and it is not controlled in any way by the government. However, government is charged with providing the right and making the right available for those who seek it but cannot afford it financially. But whether or not you hire private counsel or seek court appointed counsel you must still register this fact with government. And even if you choose not to have a lawyer at all you are still required to register that fact by signing a form we call \"waiver of right to counsel.\" \n\n \n The grand jury was intended to protect the people. It has been stood on it's head and is used now as an oppressive tool of gov't prosecutors. The accused has the right to counsel when first accused and especially at the 1517 \"hearing\" which is mainly government notice that they are seeking to prosecute someone. See Rrothgery v. Gillispie County, Texas. When a public official is indicted you can bet they will be in court the next day loaded with tax payed lawyers to challenge the indictment and seek dismissal. The common citizen is never really informed of his rights and some languish in jail simply because they are never truely informed of their rights nor appointed counsel. I would not call that \"registration\" nor does it apply as in 2A which states, \"shall not be infringed\".\n \n \n \nRegistration in these examples is required because the right is aimed at limiting the power of government-specifically its power to deal with you in a criminal matter. The right to counsel is your declaration that when criminal issues arise you no longer wish to deal with the government directly and you demand that government deal with you from now on only through an authorized legal representative. This obviously requires you to tell government that you are exercising this power to restrict its access to you and you must also tell government who that representative is. Similarly, the corresponding 5th Amendment right to counsel before questioning and the right to remain silent with or without counsel present requires you to \"register\" your exercise of these rights with government. Again, these rights act to limit what government can and cannot do (question you further or stop asking questions)-and you must tell government that you are exercising these rights so government knows when to shut up.\n \n \n It is a sad state of affairs when innocent men are unjustly accused and government giggles simply because they know full well the accused is being denied his rights. Recent court cases in SCOTUS have ruled that the accused can be questioned without his lawyer present even though he has asserted his rights...this is merely a form of deceit not much like Kagan and Sotomeyor not recusing themselves in the recent ruling on cert on the president's eligibility.\n \n \nThe common thread of all these examples is these rights are exercised only through direct contact with government, that government has duties and responsibilities which it owes to you that are triggered when you say \"I'm going to exercise this right,\" and that for this reason you must \"register\" your exercise of the right with your government.\n \n \n It is already registered in the 5th and 6th amendment and incorporated in the XIVth. Government is bound to their oaths to protect and defend this Constitution and the rights bestowed and reserved by the people. If not, trying to bypass and treat a person not convicted as anything but innocent is a crime in itself. Maybe more violations and prosecutiions of corrupt officials will become the vogue?\n \n \nCan the same be said for the RKBA? Well here's part of the rub: Government has an affirmative duty to ensure that felons and other prohibited persons do not possess firearms, and government is the sole entity that has access to the confidential criminal record information of its citizens. This is the justification for background checks, which are of course forms of temporary registration (the dealer contacts the state police by computer and says \"Bryan wants to by a Kimber .45, here is his DoB and SS# and where he says he lives, can I sell him one?\" My record is checked and government approves or denies the sale).\n\n \n I want to see, in the Constitution, where government has an affirmative duty to protect anyone much less \"ensure that felons and other prohibited persons do not possess firearms. About the only information the government is entitled to is 3 items on a 10 year Census. The rest is purloined information they are not entitled to and have abused Article 1, section 8 which is their enumerated powers. You should know full well that no license nor fee is required to exercise a right freely stated in the BOR, THE CONSTITUTION. Curiosity is an excuse, not an \"affirmative duty\".\n \n \nI think so long as we have laws that limit lawful firearm possession (no illegal aliens, no felons, no persons acquitted by reason of insanity, etc.) then the constitutional question is resolved in favor of allowing government to be told about an attempted firearm purchase and allowing government to first approve/deny the sale based upon my criminal record.\n \n \n Strange that it worked just fine before the first Nazi based gun control act was passed in 1968 as \"a presidential protection act\" and escalated from there from socialist and communist decrees slipped into the Federal Register. \n \n \nThe real question is whether government can retain that information and access it for purposes other than the immediate approval/denial of the sale-or require me to provide a status change update if I ever transfer the firearm or get one off the secondary market? That is the ultimate registration question, and it is the one SCOTUS has avoided so far.\n \n \n So far, they have been aware of their limits of power. \n \n \nAnd listen, I think now-former Justice Powell comes very close on the legal issue involved: \"Petitioners make no effort to demonstrate that the requirements are unreasonable or that they impose a severe burden on the underlying right they have asserted.\" I think this is the framework SCOTUS will ultimately use.\n \n \n Which is certainly no cause for celebration. It equates to guilty unless proven innocent.\n \n \nSo if government wants to maintain a permanent register of my firearms, then can I show that the registration requirement is unreasonable or imposes a severe burden on the underlying RKBA? If yes, then it's unconstitutional. If not, then can I make a similar showing on a claim that the registration violates my general right to privacy?\n\n \n Actually, there is much more involved than privacy. A quick read of the headlines each day assures us daily that government is not to be trusted.\n Our job is to keep the government in place, theirs is not to keep us in place and our founders said, \"to keep government from falling into error.\" What more claim is needed beyond the words, \"shall not be infringed\". Perhaps they are still hanging on Clinton's words, \"depends on what IS, is\"?\n \n \nI do not have a clear indication of how SCOTUS will ultimately decide these issues.\n\n \n If they followed their constitutional restraints and duties, there would be no doubt. \n \n Now let us all have a nice hot cup of tea :) emoticon_xgood",

   "The second registration example involves the right to vote. Like free speech and assembly, the right to vote, and the principle of \"one man, one vote,\" is considered a \"fundamental right.\" But you must pre-register to vote, and the government can keep a registration list of whether or not you have voted. . . .\n \n Similarly, voting by its very nature requires you to first pre-register and prove residency and then have your act of voting in each election recorded . . . This is because the act of voting, like marching to protest something, can only be exercised as part of a collective process, and the act of registration is required to ensure that everyone has an equal say in this collective process. . . . \n \n Thus-while marching, voting, and firearm ownership are all true personal, individual choices-voting and marching are rights we only use \"collectively\" while firearm ownership remains an individual right. It is the collective exercise of the right which requires (and thus permits) registration.\n\n \n This is a great description and I would like to draw some parallels to gun registration and the right secured by the 2nd.\n \n When one examines the early (pre-1800) legal and historical landscape regarding firearm registration there was only one constitutional justification for the states or feds to have a record of guns and their owners and that was in the returns / reports of the militia as laid out in Article X in the Militia Act of 1792:\n X. And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the brigade inspector, to attend the regimental and battalion meeting of the militia . . ., to inspect their arms, ammunition and accoutrements; . . . to make returns to the adjutant general of the state . . . reporting therein the actual situation of the arms, accoutrement, and ammunition, of the several corps, . . . [The] adjutant general shall make a return of all militia of the state, to the Commander in Chief of the said state, and a duplicate of the same to the president of the United States.\n This registration requirement was satisfied with the listing of the single firearm that the militia member furnished himself and brought to muster. \n \n That was the total and complete extent of the state's and federal government's constitutional interest in the firearms owned by a citizen; the one he will use in the collective action of his militia duty. The inspector was not required to include in militia returns the particulars of any other firearms a militia member may own for personal, private use.\n \n It would be my argument then that a direct parallel can be drawn to your examples above . . . Only the collective action has a government interest. While one must register to cast an official ballot for a candidate, we would recoil at the thought that one must register themselves to speak or publish their sentiments on said candidate or other topics of public interest. Even more repulsive is the thought that the government has an interest in a private citizen speaking or writing on his private concerns or interests. Similarly, the legitimate interest the government may have in knowing what type and caliber of firearm a militia member will use does not extend to the government having an interest in the deer rifle, squirrel gun or fowling piece that is owned by even an active, enrolled militia member for his personal use.\n \n Furthermore, with the present situation of no active militia law in this nation directing citizen action and the citizens having no duty to serve or function as militia, the federal government has extinguished all constitutional basis for its interest in any arms the private citizen owns.\n \n Whatever basis is crafted to justify modern registration it is a misconstruction or fabrication of powers from the commerce clause. I think that in the case of modern firearm registration schemes, any review of the philosophy of general militia that the founders embraced is clearly counter to the idea that the government should know who owns guns and what those guns are. What is the compelling government interest in modern times?\n \n In my opinion those who desire a modern federal registration of guns and owners should lobby Congress to enact a new Militia Act that follows the original from 1792. You would then get a list of gun owners who fall within the age and other eligibility parameters and then, only a listing of the one gun that they intend to use if called to muster. \n \n That is the extent of a constitutional federal gun registration scheme as I see it.",

   "This would almost certainly be unconstitutional. Requiring a permit like this to exercise an individual, fundamental right? I have trouble imagining how that could NOT be unconstitutional.\n\n I'd be interested to hear your reasoning. Are you suggesting that a NICS background check is effectively a \"permit\" process?\n \n \nThe background check we have now is unconstitutional and should be done away with.\nDitto on the elaboration request.\n \n \nWe have been doing them for years, it has cost us billions of dollars, and they can not show that even one person has actually be kept form purchasing a gun.\nNICS denials don't count? I assume you mean one can ultimately put their hands on a gun. Granted.\n Can that be made more difficult? \n \n \nIf somebody fails the background check they go buy a gun elsewhere.\nYes, if the front door is locked, a burglar will likely try the back. What to do? \n \n \nWe have actually reached the point in this nation where black market or gray market guns are cheaper than fully legal ones.\nWouldn't that suggest that the supply to the black market is enormous?\n Could that be reduced? \n \n \nIMO background checks essentially boil down to trying to stuff the genie back in the bottle. I think they are a bad idea and if we actually did institute them there would be some pretty bad unintended consequences. Right now, even for criminals, \"normal\" firearms are easy to come by. They are all over the place. If they have to actually go to the trouble of smuggling them into the country for sale to criminals, it would be foolish to smuggle in semi automatic weapons where there is a world full of dirt cheap military weaponry out there. In most of Africa a glock will set you back $600 or more if you can even find one. You can buy a fully automatic Krinkov (compact AK more or less) with an entire case of loaded magazins for under $50. If you were a smuggler looking to buy weapons abroad for sale on the US black market, you would be a fool to not go with the military stuff.\nIf military weapons are cheaper and more powerful, why don't they smuggle them into the US now? Too much trouble? Bulkier things come across every day. \n \n \nThe idea that we are going to pass some kind of legislation that takes guns out of the hands of criminals is foolish. Criminals, by definition, do not obey the law. Pass all the laws you want and it is not going to disarm criminals. Pass the WRONG laws and you may well end up arming them a lot better than they are now.\nI'm trying to think of a law that prevents someone breaking it. \n Laws are a pretext for punishment. \n Any deterrent effect would be a bonus.\n \n I don't delude myself into believing any gun regulation will \"prevent\" a motivated criminal.\n I would be content to \"inhibit\" where possible.",

   "Let me start with this statement: Right now under federal and my state's law every time I go to a FFL dealer and try to buy a gun the government is notified in advance. A government official I have never met is told that I have come in to the store, picked out a firearm for purchase, my date of birth, my claimed residence, and my social security number. That official is then allowed to use all this information to access a database and determine whether or not the sale of the gun to me would violate a law. The official then communicates back to the dealer with an approval/non-approval message. Right now the official does not know if I then choose to buy the gun or change my mind and walk out. But the fact that I have gone far enough in the process to be checked is registered with a government official (in my state with the Virginia State Police). As of right now that official cannot keep this information or make use of it further (except for non-identifying statistics like tracking the number of guns sold in my state and the number of denied purchases). \n \n Now whether you like this or not this is a very limited form of temporary registration. I have said this before and I will say it again now: I am opposed to carrying this any further. But the question I am after right now is whether or not going further would be constitutional-for if registration is unconstitutional then no matter how much some people think registration is a good idea the discussion is over. That is the question I am looking at. \n \n In my earlier examples of registration and other rights I am purposely using a broad definition of registration. This is because I cannot find any examples that closely relate to the types of registration I have seen proposed for firearm owners. And, in offering my examples, I am trying to show how they all share a common thread of necessity because the rights involve interaction with government-a factor that is not present with the RKBA. \n \n All of my examples involve necessary governmental action to facilitate the right. In the sense of purely collective exercises like freedom of assembly in marching, governmental action can be seen as necessary to secure the public venue for the event and to provide security if others attempt to interfere with the free exercise of the right by disrupting the march. The individual exercises of the rights like the 5th and 6th Amendment examples all involve declarations to the government that put it on notice to respect the free exercise of these rights. \n \n None of this is required when I store a gun in my home. Inappropriate curiosity aside, where is government's legitimate interest in knowing how many firearms I own outside of a militia obligation? Or, for that matter, while government can have a legitimate interest in knowing if I and a thousand others choose to march down main street to the courthouse, where is government's legitimate interest in requiring me to register with them before I blog here? \n \n My examples were intended to show how they are in fact different from the RKBA. These require government notice and action to facilitate the free exercise of the right-something the RKBA does not need. If someone else has an example of registration involving a fundamental individual right that in any way resembles a proposal for registration of firearms then please post it so we can consider it. I have found none.\n \n But coming back to registration....Registration troubles me right now because I saw the majority in McDonald avoid the constitutional question altogether. Listen, Heller and McDonald have not built the house for us yet. They have only laid the proper foundation-we don't know what the final product is going to look like. I'm going to cite a case that I'm not all that fond of but I like the quote anyway:\n \n \"Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt.\" Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 844 (1992)\n \n I don't have doubts about my own views involving the importance of the RKBA. But I do have doubts about the reach of the RKBA under Heller and McDonald. There is still a lot out there that has not been decided, and the question of registration is one of these issues.\n \n Let me come back to the right of privacy for a moment....\n \n The Court has undergone significant personnel changes recently, but I think the \"liberal wing\" of the Court has not changed its basic view of our rights. That wing has for decades sought to expand its reach to find rights nowhere mentioned in the Constitution. One of these is a right to \"privacy\" which now retired anti-gun standard bearer justice Stevens briefly touched on in McDonald: \n \n This understanding is consonant with the venerable \"notion that governmental authority has implied limits which [Slip Op. 6] preserve private autonomy,\"6 a notion which predates the founding and which finds reinforcement in the Constitution's Ninth Amendment, see Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 486-493 (1965) (Goldberg, J., concurring).  McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___ 081521, 5-6 (2010) (Stevens, dissenting)\n \n Stevens here quotes from a landmark privacy rights case involving the right of privacy in choosing whether or not to use contraceptive devices. Let me quote some more from that case: \n \n The foregoing cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance. See Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 516-522 (dissenting opinion). Various guarantees create zones of privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one, as we have seen. The Third Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers \"in any house\" in time of peace without the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy. The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the \"right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" The Fifth Amendment in its Self-Incrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which government may not force him to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides: \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\"\n \n The Fourth and Fifth Amendments were described in Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 630, as protection against all governmental invasions \"of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life.\"* We recently referred [Page 485] in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 656, to the Fourth Amendment as creating a \"right to privacy, no less important than any other right carefully and particularly reserved to the people.\" See Beaney, The Constitutional Right to Privacy, 1962 Sup. Ct. Rev. 212; Griswold, The Right to be Let Alone, 55 Nw. U. L. Rev. 216 (1960).\n \n We have had many controversies over these penumbral rights of \"privacy and repose.\" See, e.g., Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U.S. 622, 626, 644; Public Utilities Comm'n v. Pollak, 343 U.S. 451; Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167; Lanza v. New York, 370 U.S. 139; Frank v. Maryland, 359 U.S. 360; Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541. These cases bear witness that the right of privacy which presses for recognition here is a legitimate one.\" Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 484-485 (1965)\n \n Stevens is a fan of this case and its rights-expansive logic, but when it comes to a right he personally dislikes then he gets all conservative on us and says:\n \n To the extent that petitioners contend the city of Chicago's registration requirements for firearm possessors also, and separately, violate the Constitution, that claim borders on the frivolous. Petitioners make no effort to demonstrate that the requirements are unreasonable or that they impose a severe burden on the underlying right they have asserted.McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___ 081521, 57 (2010) (Stevens, dissenting)\n \n Well justice Stevens, If what I quoted above from Griswold was sufficient to protect my right to privacy in whether or not I choose to keep a contraceptive device in my medicine cabinet, the why can't it also extend to a right of privacy in whether or not I choose to keep a handgun in my nightstand?\n \n I guess what I am saying boils down to this: If Justice Stevens and others remain bent upon denying or severely limiting my rights, then I'm not ready to surrender any argument I can make to support my RKBA so long as I can ground it in either common sense or prior SCOTUS rulings (even if you believe the prior rulings depart from common sense). The right of privacy argument is one I am not ready to abandon yet over the registration issue because it is a right the liberal wing of the Court has attached importance too. I can't say that I believe this argument will be persuasive with the liberal wing of the Court, but I do want them to remember their prior arguments when they consider abandoning their principles in the name of expediency to lash out at a right they don't like. \n \n ---\n \n The issue, however, is not whether court rules are \"mutable\"; they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of \"various circumstances,\" they can be \"modifi[ed]\"; they assuredly can. The issue is whether, as mutated and modified, they must make sense. The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.

I agree the serial number is not \"temporarily registered\" with the data sent to the government for the background check. However, the serial number is permanently linked to me as the purchaser on the transaction form, and that form is permanently kept by the FFL. It is a form of decentralized (yet permanent) registration of all gun purchases from FFL dealers linking the name of the purchaser to the firearm by type of firearm, manufacturer, make, model, serial number, and date of purchase. ATF has the power to generally inspect these forms at the dealer's place of business (someone help me because I can't remember the frequency provided for in the statutes), and local law enforcement gets a copy of the form when a trace request is initiated on a particular firearm. I know because I've seen them before. And if the FFL ever goes out of business then ATF inherits all these transaction forms.\n \n I don't think we can fairly compare this to voting registration.

   "From the Anti-gun Violence policy Center. I kid you not! \n \n Written back when the suspected cost of their gun registry was projected to only be $327 million Canadian. It ran up to be a BILLION Dollars,   or was it 2 Billion? Yep!  emoticon_smile \n \n Anyway given our current Financial situation, does anyone think this is a wise use of our actual Crime Fighting Dollars? \n   What are the limitations of licensing and registration? \nLicensing systems are very expensive to administer. Canada's experience with its full licensing and registration system, begun in December 1998, is not encouraging. The government originally estimated that the cost of licensing Canada's three million gun owners and registering their seven million guns would be $185 million [Canadian] over five years including a one-time start-up cost of $85 million [Canadian]. But, by March 2000 the Canadian Firearms Centre admitted that the system had already cost Canadian taxpayers $327 million [Canadian] and was running up an annual bill nearly 10 times higher than the government's original forecast. The March announcement also revealed that although 270,000 valid licenses existed from the country's earlier gun control system, only 142,000 new licenses had been issued. Using these figures as a baseline for America's arsenal of 65 million handguns, the estimated cost of such a system here is staggering.\n \n Most importantly, licensing and registration in America would have little effect on the vast majority of gun violence, such as unintentional gunshot deaths, suicides and the majority of homicides, since most homicides are the result of arguments between people who know each other and who purchase guns legally.\n \n From a political perspective, a battle over licensing and registration brings every gun owner into the fray. The NRA argument that licensing and registration is the first step towards gun confiscation has always been very persuasive with gun owners. In contrast, health and safety regulation of the industry focuses on the conduct of firearm manufacturers.\n \n Advocates of licensing and registration often cite automobiles as an example of the value of licensing and registration: we register automobiles and license drivers, so why not guns? However, licensing and registration\u00ef\u00bf1/2the primary purpose of which was to enforce a system of taxation\u00ef\u00bf1/2had virtually no effect on automobile death and injury. It was not until the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration was established in the 1960s, and changes were forced in automobile design and the driving environment, that decreases were seen.\n\n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n What did the CDC study?\n Bans on specified firearms or ammunition.\n Restrictions on firearm acquisition.\n Waiting periods for firearm acquisition.\n Firearm registration and licensing of owners\n Child access prevention laws.\n Zero tolerance laws for firearms in schools.\n \n  What did they find?  \n &#8220;the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&#8221; \n",

Why are FFL dealers required to surrender their records to the ATF when they go out of business?\n \n For what purpose are we holding onto useless sheets of paper for two decades and imposing punishment for their improper storage if they don't amount to a government accessible database?\n \n You really strike me as being highly contradictory in your arguments here. You're arguing that the current system in place doesn't amount to a database because it's not centralized, and it's scattered nature isn't good enough at doing the task of tracking weapons so it can't be considered a registry, despite all the evidence to the contrary.

Therefore it doesn't matter if you buy it. But these are the facts that are in place and they have to be accepted, like them or not. And the facts are that the ATF can track a firearm from company, to seller, to owner, and do it all with the records stored at various FFL dealers scattered across the country. That's the truth and if you don't accept it then that's your own fault.\n \n Furthermore, as I covered in my other thread here, the records of out of business FFL dealers ARE stored in a centralized location with the ATF in their tracing facility. Tens of thousands of boxes, all housed in a single building. In other words a centralized database, held by the government. Argue otherwise if you can.\n \n \nTo me it would be like referring to all the works of the Masters hanging in private homes as a \"decentralized museum\".\n\n \n Except FFL dealers aren't comparable to private homes so your comparison comes up short.",

   "Here is a letter with some sage thoughts!\n \n \n 1. Registering 70 million American households is extremely expensive. \n \n Do you know what it takes to run a database that big? You need 19,000 changes daily, just to keep up with people who move every ten years. Floor after floor of cubicle after cubicle for employees with permanent jobs, payroll, parking and dry cleaning bills. It's a government jobs program all by itself, all in the common sense -- but deceptive name -- of stopping crime. How many criminals do you figure will register when all is said and done? That's right, none, and the planners know that. All that money and time, invested on tracking the innocent. That's why so many police departments are against it -- they'll be forced to run huge data centers with their limited resources, and hire clerks instead of cops. \n \n 2. Americans who fail to register would become felons without committing a crime. \n \n Under registration, activity that is a common practice and has been perfectly legal since inception makes you a felon. Think about that. Possession of private property would subject you to felony arrest, if the property isn't on the government's master list. Boy, that doesn't sound like the American way. No other evil is needed, there is no victim and no inherent criminal act takes place. Paperwork equals prison. That's just wrong. \n \n 3. Registration, if enacted, will create an underground market for unregistered guns bigger than the drug trade. \n \n How many times must an elite forbid what the public wants, before learning the unintended consequences of outlawing liberties? People get what they want either way, it's just a question of how much crime the government itself forces to accompany it. With respect to guns, the last thing you want to encourage is the creative import programs and price supports that drug dealers enjoy, for gun runners. \n \n 4. People have said to me, \"But Alan, if all guns were registered and there was a crime, then you could tell.\" \n \n Tell what? If your neighbor is shot, that's not probable cause to search everyone with a matching caliber in a ten-block radius. The evidence needed to conclusively link a person to a crime has no connection at all to a registration plan -- you need motive, opportunity, witnesses, physical evidence, the murder weapon. Police aren't waiting for official lists so they can start catching murderers. Gun registration schemes lack a crime prevention component. \n \n 5. You don't really think authorities would use gun registration lists to confiscate weapons from people, do you? \n \n Despite real-life examples recently of exactly that in New York, California and Louisiana, and global history for the past century, this couldn't really happen, do you think? Who would even support such a thing in a country like America, with its Bill of Rights? The guarantees against confiscating property, unwarranted seizures and the right to keep and bear arms would surely forestall any such abuse of power. Are there really U.S. politician who would support firearm seizures? (Unfortunately, it's a long list of usual suspects.) \n And what about the so-called First Amendment test? If it's OK for arms it must pass muster for words too. Why would an honest writer object to being on the government list of approved writers? Why indeed. \n \n Pile logic on logic, some people just feel the government should register everything, just to keep control. When government has that much control, you no longer possess your liberties. You're living where government lists define who can do what, and where people control trumps crime control -- the gun registration model precisely. This form of \"gun control\" isn't about guns, it's about control. \n \n I might favor registration if the system would include criminals. In fact, I'd favor testing the system on them first. But the U.S. Supreme Court, in a widely known case (Haynes v. U.S., 1968), had determined that a felon who has a gun cannot be compelled to complete such forms, because it violates the Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination. That's right, mandatory registration -- not in your case of course but in the case of a criminal -- is a self-indictment of a crime, and is therefore prohibited.*\n \n Gun listing is a feel-good deception that passes unquestioned by the \"news\" media, engorges the federal or state bureaucracy, and undercuts the linchpins of American freedoms. It has no more place in a free society than a government authorized list of words, and should be rejected outright. Elected officials who promote such a scheme are opposing the very Constitution they take an oath to preserve, protect and defend, and deserve to be removed from office. \n",

   "So you are saying those penalties were not established by the Militia Act of 1792; they were directives from a later Secretary of War?\n \n I'd like a citation for that because in 1794 Secretary Knox told the House that while the Militia Act of 1792 required citizens to provide their own arms and equipment there was no means for the federal government to penalize someone ignoring that directive. LINK\n \n He notes (next page) state attempts to penalize willful non-compliance but I am not aware of later federal attempts. Can I get a cite or two?\n\n \n As far as I know there were none. After Knox realized and argued for the futility of the federal government trying to enforce those provisions a system of federal armories was put into place to ensure that the people could be armed if needed. \n \n That is a different issue. The firearms census ordered by Knox (actually drafted by knox, ordered by washington) was carried out within the structure of the militia. The state AG's were responsible for collating the data with local militia officers actually carrying out the count among their units. \n \n \n \n \nThis is true but I would say that as the returns of militia traveled up the chain of command the information was stripped down into more general categories. By the time federal authorities received their reports there was no personal information in them, it was just aggregate numbers by state.\n \n Yes, these reports were broken down to type of arm but no information was there to garner who owned what on an individual level. That info was I'm sure recorded at the lower levels but I have never seen anything that supports the notion that individual ownership info was transmitted to the federal government.\n\n \n This is true, but that is because the federal government did not want it, not because there was something that kept them from having it. If you are the federal government trying to organize an armed response to an invasion, it does not matter than john smith has 3 rifles and ed smith has 4. You just need to know that there are 7 rifles available. The local guys are the only ones who need to know where they are and what kind (so they know what kind of ammunition they need for them). \n \n \n\n But the constitutional impetus for having a record of citizens and their arms was extinguished by Congress itself by the Dick Act.\n\n \n This is true. However, the question here is not whether or not there is a constitutional impetus, it is whether or not there is a constitutional prohibition, and whether or not the ability to do so falls within the powers of the legislative, executive, or judicial branch. \n \n I argue that no such prohibition exists and that regardless of the dick act, the power to require registration is still a power that the federal government holds. Legislation is not a constitutional amendment. \n \n \nYou can not argue that because constitutional legitimacy for de-facto registration once existed under now defunct Militia Law that even more expansive registration for much different modern purposes enjoys the same constitutional legitimacy. That's just foolish.\n\n \n I did not argue purpose at all, and in this conversation \"purpose\" has not place because the \"registration\" is legally separate from anything they do with the data. \n \n \n \nBut under strict scrutiny it is your job to show how registration fulfills a compelling government interest that can not be achieved any other way . . .\n\n \n Strict scrutiny has no meaning here unless you can explain that firearms registration somehow infringes on your rights. Example:\n \n Lets say we have a firearms registration requirement. You go to the gun store. You buy an Uzi. Sometime within a reasonable time frame you are required to fill out a form that lists your name, address, the type of gun you purchased, and its serial number. You fill out the form. You drop it in the mail.\n \n At what point were your rights violated there? Obviously it was not your second amendment rights....you have a shiny new Uzi sitting in front of you. So what rights were violated? \n \n I have asked this question in every thread where this has been discussed and nobody seems to be able to answer the question. Nato and Tither tend to go into long winded explanations that start with \"well, if they use the registration to confiscate.....\" Confiscation would without question be unconstitutional. That does not make registration unconstitutional. That is like arguing that having you file a tax return is unconstitutional because they could use the list of taxpayers to assassinate every one of us. \n \n Assassination unconstitutional. Tax return not. \n Confiscation unconstitutional. Registration not.",

(note, for those interested part (j) deals with record keeping at gun shows....) \n \n \n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923 - Licensing\n \n \n (g)\n \n (1)\n \n (A) Each licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, and licensed dealer shall maintain such records of importation, production, shipment, receipt, sale, or other disposition of firearms at his place of business for such period, and in such form, as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe. Such importers, manufacturers, and dealers shall not be required to submit to the Attorney General reports and information with respect to such records and the contents thereof, except as expressly required by this section. The Attorney General, when he has reasonable cause to believe a violation of this chapter has occurred and that evidence thereof may be found on such premises, may, upon demonstrating such cause before a Federal magistrate judge and securing from such magistrate judge a warrant authorizing entry, enter during business hours the premises (including places of storage) of any licensed firearms importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, licensed collector, or any licensed importer or manufacturer of ammunition, for the purpose of inspecting or examining -\n \n (i) any records or documents required to be kept by such licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector under this chapter or rules or regulations under this chapter, and\n \n (ii) any firearms or ammunition kept or stored by such licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector, at such premises.\n \n (B) The Attorney General may inspect or examine the inventory and records of a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer without such reasonable cause or warrant -\n \n (i) in the course of a reasonable inquiry during the course of a criminal investigation of a person or persons other than the licensee;\n \n (ii) for ensuring compliance with the record keeping requirements of this chapter -\n \n (I) not more than once during any 12-month period; or\n \n (II) at any time with respect to records relating to a firearm involved in a criminal investigation that is traced to the licensee; or\n \n (iii) when such inspection or examination may be required for determining the disposition of one or more particular firearms in the course of a bona fide criminal investigation.\n \n (C) The Attorney General may inspect the inventory and records of a licensed collector without such reasonable cause or warrant -\n \n (i) for ensuring compliance with the record keeping requirements of this chapter not more than once during any twelve-month period; or\n \n (ii) when such inspection or examination may be required for determining the disposition of one or more particular firearms in the course of a bona fide criminal investigation.\n \n (D) At the election of a licensed collector, the annual inspection of records and inventory permitted under this paragraph shall be performed at the office of the Attorney General designated for such inspections which is located in closest proximity to the premises where the inventory and records of such licensed collector are maintained. The inspection and examination authorized by this paragraph shall not be construed as authorizing the Attorney General to seize any records or other documents other than those records or documents constituting material evidence of a violation of law. If the Attorney General seizes such records or documents, copies shall be provided the licensee within a reasonable time. The Attorney General may make available to any Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency any information which he may obtain by reason of this chapter with respect to the identification of persons prohibited from purchasing or receiving firearms or ammunition who have purchased or received firearms or ammunition, together with a description of such firearms or ammunition, and he may provide information to the extent such information may be contained in the records required to be maintained by this chapter, when so requested by any Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency.\n \n (2) Each licensed collector shall maintain in a bound volume the nature of which the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe, records of the receipt, sale, or other disposition of firearms. Such records shall include the name and address of any person to whom the collector sells or otherwise disposes of a firearm. Such collector shall not be required to submit to the Attorney General reports and information with respect to such records and the contents thereof, except as expressly required by this section.\n \n (3)\n \n (A) Each licensee shall prepare a report of multiple sales or other dispositions whenever the licensee sells or otherwise disposes of, at one time or during any five consecutive business days, two or more pistols, or revolvers, or any combination of pistols and revolvers totalling two or more, to an unlicensed person. The report shall be prepared on a form specified by the Attorney General and forwarded to the office specified thereon and to the department of State police or State law enforcement agency of the State or local law enforcement agency of the local jurisdiction in which the sale or other disposition took place, not later than the close of business on the day that the multiple sale or other disposition occurs.\n \n (B) Except in the case of forms and contents thereof regarding a purchaser who is prohibited by subsection (g) or (n) of section 922 of this title from receipt of a firearm, the department of State police or State law enforcement agency or local law enforcement agency of the local jurisdiction shall not disclose any such form or the contents thereof to any person or entity, and shall destroy each such form and any record of the contents thereof no more than 20 days from the date such form is received. No later than the date that is 6 months after the effective date of this subparagraph, and at the end of each 6-month period thereafter, the department of State police or State law enforcement agency or local law enforcement agency of the local jurisdiction shall certify to the Attorney General of the United States that no disclosure contrary to this subparagraph has been made and that all forms and any record of the contents thereof have been destroyed as provided in this subparagraph.\n \n (4) Where a firearms or ammunition business is discontinued and succeeded by a new licensee, the records required to be kept by this chapter shall appropriately reflect such facts and shall be delivered to the successor. Where discontinuance of the business is absolute, such records shall be delivered within thirty days after the business discontinuance to the Attorney General. However, where State law or local ordinance requires the delivery of records to other responsible authority, the Attorney General may arrange for the delivery of such records to such other responsible authority.\n \n (5)\n \n (A) Each licensee shall, when required by letter issued by the Attorney General, and until notified to the contrary in writing by the Attorney General, submit on a form specified by the Attorney General, for periods and at the times specified in such letter, all record information required to be kept by this chapter or such lesser record information as the Attorney General in such letter may specify.\n \n (B) The Attorney General may authorize such record information to be submitted in a manner other than that prescribed in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph when it is shown by a licensee that an alternate method of reporting is reasonably necessary and will not unduly hinder the effective administration of this chapter. A licensee may use an alternate method of reporting if the licensee describes the proposed alternate method of reporting and the need therefor in a letter application submitted to the Attorney General, and the Attorney General approves such alternate method of reporting.\n \n (6) Each licensee shall report the theft or loss of a firearm from the licensee's inventory or collection, within 48 hours after the theft or loss is discovered, to the Attorney General and to the appropriate local authorities.\n \n (7) Each licensee shall respond immediately to, and in no event later than 24 hours after the receipt of, a request by the Attorney General for information contained in the records required to be kept by this chapter as may be required for determining the disposition of 1 or more firearms in the course of a bona fide criminal investigation. The requested information shall be provided orally or in writing, as the Attorney General may require. The Attorney General shall implement a system whereby the licensee can positively identify and establish that an individual requesting information via telephone is employed by and authorized by the agency to request such information.\n \n (h) Licenses issued under the provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall be kept posted and kept available for inspection on the premises covered by the license.\n \n (i) Licensed importers and licensed manufacturers shall identify by means of a serial number engraved or cast on the receiver or frame of the weapon, in such manner as the Attorney General shall by regulations prescribe, each firearm imported or manufactured by such importer or manufacturer. The serial number of any semiautomatic assault weapon manufactured after the date of the enactment of this sentence shall clearly show the date on which the weapon was manufactured. A large capacity ammunition feeding device manufactured after the date of the enactment of this sentence shall be identified by a serial number that clearly shows that the device was manufactured or imported after the effective date of this subsection, and such other identification as the Attorney General may by regulation prescribe.\n \n (j) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer may, under rules or regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, conduct business temporarily at a location other than the location specified on the license if such temporary location is the location for a gun show or event sponsored by any national, State, or local organization, or any affiliate of any such organization devoted to the collection, competitive use, or other sporting use of firearms in the community, and such location is in the State which is specified on the license. Records of receipt and disposition of firearms transactions conducted at such temporary location shall include the location of the sale or other disposition and shall be entered in the permanent records of the licensee and retained on the location specified on the license. Nothing in this subsection shall authorize any licensee to conduct business in or from any motorized or towed vehicle. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, a separate fee shall not be required of a licensee with respect to business conducted under this subsection. Any inspection or examination of inventory or records under this chapter by the Attorney General at such temporary location shall be limited to inventory consisting of, or records relating to, firearms held or disposed at such temporary location. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the Attorney General to inspect or examine the inventory or records of a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer at any location other than the location specified on the license. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to diminish in any manner any right to display, sell, or otherwise dispose of firearms or ammunition, which is in effect before the date of the enactment of the Firearms Owners' Protection Act, including the right of a licensee to conduct \"curios or relics\" firearms transfers and business away from their business premises with another licensee without regard as to whether the location of where the business is conducted is located in the State specified on the license of either licensee.\n \n (k) Licensed importers and licensed manufacturers shall mark all armor piercing projectiles and packages containing such projectiles for distribution in the manner prescribed by the Attorney General by regulation. The Attorney General shall furnish information to each dealer licensed under this chapter defining which projectiles are considered armor piercing ammunition as defined in section 921(a)(17)(B).\n \n (l) The Attorney General shall notify the chief law enforcement officer in the appropriate State and local jurisdictions of the names and addresses of all persons in the State to whom a firearms license is issued.",

   "I'd be interested to hear your reasoning. Are you suggesting that a NICS background check is effectively a \"permit\" process?\n \n Ditto on the elaboration request.\n\n \n It is obviously a permit process. You fill out your paperwork, the dealer calls it in, the government either issues a verbal permit for you to buy the weapon or they dont. \n \n \nNICS denials don't count? I assume you mean one can ultimately put their hands on a gun. Granted.\n Can that be made more difficult? \n\n \n No. NICS denials do not count. First of all, the majority of them are mistakes. Second of all, the denial just means that they can not buy it at a dealer. I generally do not buy guns at dealers either. And yet I have lots and lots of guns. \n \n Can them ultimately getting their hands on a gun be made more difficult? Not really. Guns are small, difficult to detect on the street (if a truck goes buy with 300 crates of rifles in it, you are probably not going to realize it), and easy to come by. There is probably nothing at all we can do to keep them out of the hands of criminals.\n \n That does not mean there are not gun control laws that work and work well. In my state, the maximum penalty for burglary is 5 years, with most burglars serving from 1-3 years. If you are caught burglarizing a house and have a firearm in your possession, there is a mandatory 15 year sentencing enhancement. As a result, Burglars here do not carry firearms. Our local county sheriff says he has never even heard of a burglar being caught with a firearm in this state. It simply does not happen. \n \n \n \n Wouldn't that suggest that the supply to the black market is enormous?\n Could that be reduced?\n \n If military weapons are cheaper and more powerful, why don't they smuggle them into the US now? Too much trouble? Bulkier things come across every day. \n\n \n They are not cheaper than current black and gray market weapons when you consider transport, risk, and the effort required. As long as you can buy a black market (usually stolen) weapon in the US for $100 or less, importing one from overseas is pretty much a waste. \n \n The second thing to consider is that we have another gun control law that works here, which is the NFA (machine gun prohibition). As long as you can get something semi-auto and cheap, there is no reason to risk the additional penalties that come with being in possession of an unregistered machine gun. \n \n \nI'm trying to think of a law that prevents someone breaking it. \n Laws are a pretext for punishment. \n Any deterrent effect would be a bonus.\n \n I don't delude myself into believing any gun regulation will \"prevent\" a motivated criminal.\n I would be content to \"inhibit\" where possible.\n\n \n That is why, IMO, we need to focus on laws that actually have a crime control element. Gun control is a waste of money and time and ultimately it is not even a laudable goal. I do not care who has a gun. I care what they DO with it. The above example regarding burglars is a good one. I dont care if a burglar has a gun at home under his bed. I care if he has a gun in my living room. \n \n The question is how far we are willing to go, how much we are willing to spend, and how much we trust our fellow man. Add an automatic 15 year sentencing enhancement to robberies, drug related activity, gand related activity, etc... where the criminal has a gun in their possession, and we will PROBABLY see a much lower rate of criminal gun use. The cost would be extremely high, because it is very expensive to put people in jail for 15 years. There is also a violence related risk. A drug dealer who is about to be arrested and knows they will be looking at 20 years (5 for the drugs, 15 for the gun) may well choose to shoot it out with the police in order to escape. I know if I was facing 20 years in jail I would absolutely shoot it out with the police if I thought I might get away. \n \n I do think I understand where you are coming from with your views on this, I just think it is too idealistic. What the whole thing basically boils down to is just another law aimed at prohibiting criminals from having guns. We already have a bunch of laws against criminals having guns. They dont obey those, they are not going to obey a new one. This just seems like doing more of what we already know does not work. This just creates more hoops for law abiding gun owners to jump through and I see no point in that.",

   "I have to disagree. Registration results in a register/registry. \n You're doing what NATO did with \"database\". No \"base\", no \"database\". \n If the individual records aren't assembled then I can't see it. \n To me it would be like referring to all the works of the Masters \n hanging in private homes as a \"decentralized museum\".\n\n \n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923 (g) (2)  Each licensed collector shall maintain in a bound volume the nature of which the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe, records of the receipt, sale, or other disposition of firearms. Such records shall include the name and address of any person to whom the collector sells or otherwise disposes of a firearm. Such collector shall not be required to submit to the Attorney General reports and information with respect to such records and the contents thereof, except as expressly required by this section. (emphasis added)\n \n Now we may be arguing \"what's in a name...\" but isn't this an \"assembly\" of the records that qualifies as a \"database\" of all firearm transactions by a dealer? Sure its old school non-computerized stuff, and it is decentralized and distributed amongst the various FFL dealers, but the database still exists at each and every FFL's place of business and these bound volumes can be examined without any showing of need by the Attorney General or his designee. \n \n I don't agree with your art analogy. I don't consider individual pieces of art hanging in private homes a \"decentralized museum\" any more than I consider firearms held in private hands a \"decentralized arsenal.\" \n \n A better art analogy would be a law that requires all works of art to have serial numbers assigned to them, to be originally sold only by licensed art dealers who keep a record of every sale including the identification of which person bought which piece of art-compiled in a bound volume-that must be produced on demand at least once per year for a cultural police officer to examine if he is curious about what has been going on at the dealer's shop. \n \n This, of course, might cut down on sales of the black velvet edition paintings of \"Elvis at the Last Supper\" sold at some gas stations....\n \n But, like firearms I own, what business is it of the government to know which paintings I purchase?",

Well here's part of the rub: Government has an affirmative duty to ensure that felons and other prohibited persons do not possess firearms, and government is the sole entity that has access to the confidential criminal record information of its citizens. This is the justification for background checks, which are of course forms of temporary registration (the dealer contacts the state police by computer and says \"Bryan wants to by a Kimber .45, here is his DoB and SS# and where he says he lives, can I sell him one?\" My record is checked and government approves or denies the sale).\n \n I think so long as we have laws that limit lawful firearm possession (no illegal aliens, no felons, no persons acquitted by reason of insanity, etc.) then the constitutional question is resolved in favor of allowing government to be told about an attempted firearm purchase and allowing government to first approve/deny the sale based upon my criminal record.\n \n The real question is whether government can retain that information and access it for purposes other than the immediate approval/denial of the sale-or require me to provide a status change update if I ever transfer the firearm or get one off the secondary market? That is the ultimate registration question, and it is the one SCOTUS has avoided so far.\n \n And listen, I think now-former Justice Powell comes very close on the legal issue involved: \"Petitioners make no effort to demonstrate that the requirements are unreasonable or that they impose a severe burden on the underlying right they have asserted.\" I think this is the framework SCOTUS will ultimately use.\n \n So if government wants to maintain a permanent register of my firearms, then can I show that the registration requirement is unreasonable or imposes a severe burden on the underlying RKBA? If yes, then it's unconstitutional. If not, then can I make a similar showing on a claim that the registration violates my general right to privacy?\n \n I do not have a clear indication of how SCOTUS will ultimately decide these issues.\n\n \n The underlined portion is the important one. Can you show that a registration requirement is unreasonable or imposes a severe burden on your RKBA?\n \n Personally I am doubtful. So far none of you have managed to produce a logical argument that it imposes any kind of burden on your RKBA AT ALL, much less a severe one. Your argument basically boils down to \"For some reason that I cannot explain I just kind of feel like it infringes on my rights....\"\n \n That is not a legal argument.",

It does not need to meet any level of scrutiny because there is simply no way that you can come to the conclusion that registration infringes or limits your RKBA. I think you need to go back and read the definitions of \"registration\" that were posted earlier in the thread. Registration is simply somehow letting the government know what firearms you have, or when you purchase a new one. A registration program does not allow them to limit your purchases or ownership. \n \n The example I gave earlier in the thread:\n \n You go to the gun store and buy a new Uzi. Within a reasonable timeframe you have to fill out a form that has your name, address, phone number, type of weapon, and serial number of the weapon. \n \n WHAT RIGHT DOES THIS VIOLATE\n \n Not one single person here has managed to answer that question.

I have everything from italian dueling pistols (matchlocks, none of that new fangled flintlock stuff) to M-60 machine guns. I sold my minigun last year.

I love my second amendment rights and am more than willing to fight for them. In the last year I have spent put a little over $20,000 in a legal slush fund that several guys I know (6 of us) are using to fund a suit to challenge both the NFA and the machine gun ban. I helped fund the Heller case through the Cato institute. \n \n So dont you DARE tell me that I have tried to take away anybodies second amendment rights simply because I refuse to pretend that there are rights in the constitution that simply do not exist there. \n \n This is actually a more important issue than many likely realize at this point, which is probably why Bryan started the thread.

It could hardly be denied that a tax laid specifically on the exercise of those freedoms would be unconstitutional. Yet the license tax imposed by this ordinance is in substance just that. \n\n \n NO REGISTRATION:\n \n\n It is contended, however, that the fact that the license tax can suppress or control this activity is unim- [319 U.S. 105, 113] portant if it does not do so. But that is to disregard the nature of this tax. It is a license tax-a flat tax imposed on the exercise of a privilege granted by the Bill of Rights. A state may not impose a charge for the enjoyment of a right granted by the federal constitution. Thus, it may not exact a license tax for the privilege of carrying on interstate commerce ( McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co., 309 U.S. 33 , 56-58, 60 S.Ct. 388, 397, 398, 128 A.L.R. 876), although it may tax the property used in, or the income derived from, that commerce, so long as those taxes are not discriminatory. Id., 309 U.S. at page 47, 60 S.Ct. at page 392, 128 A.L.R. 876 and cases cited. A license tax applied to activities guaranteed by the First Amendment would have the same destructive effect. It is true that the First Amendment, like the commerce clause, draws no distinction between license taxes, fixed sum taxes, and other kinds of taxes. But that is no reason why we should shut our eyes to the nature of the tax and its destructive influence. The power to impose a license tax on the exercise of these freedoms is indeed as potent as the power of censorship which this Court has repeatedly struck down. Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U.S. 444 , 58 S.Ct. 666; Schneider v. State, supra; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 306 , 60 S.Ct. 900, 904, 128 A.L.R. 1352; Largent v. Texas, 318 U.S. 418 , 63 S.Ct. 667, 87 L.Ed. --; Jamison v. Texas, supra. It was for that reason that the dissenting opinions in Jones v. Opelika, supra, stressed the nature of this type of tax. 316 U.S. at pages 607-609, 620, 623, 62 S.Ct. at pages 1243, 1244, 1250, 1251, 141 A.L.R. 514. In that case, as in the present ones, we have something very different from a registration system under which those going from house to house are required to give their names, addresses and other marks of identification to the authorities. In all of these cases the issuance of the permit or license is dependent on the payment of a license tax. And the license tax is fixed in amount and unrelated to the scope of the activities of petitioners or to their realized revenues. It is not a nominal fee [319 U.S. 105, 114] imposed as a regulatory measure to defray the expenses of policing the activities in question. 8 It is in no way apportioned. It is a flat license tax levied and collected as a condition to the pursuit of activities whose enjoyment is guaranteed by the First Amendment. Accordingly, it restrains in advance those constitutional liberties of press and religion and inevitably tends to suppress their exercise. That is almost uniformly recognized as the inherent vice and evil of this flat license tax. As stated by the Supreme Court of Illinois in a case involving this same sect and an ordinance similar to the present one, a person cannot be compelled 'to purchase, through a license fee or a license tax, the privilege freely granted by the constitution.' 9 Blue Island v. Kozul, 379 Ill. 511, 519, 41 N.E.2d 515, 519. So it may not be said that proof is lacking that these license taxes either separately or cumulatively have restricted or are likely to restrict petitioners' religious activities. On their face they are a restriction of the free exercise of those freedoms which are protected by the First Amendment. \n \n The taxes imposed by this ordinance can hardly help but be as severe and telling in their impact on the freedom [319 U.S. 105, 115] of the press and religion as the 'taxes on knowledge' at which the First Amendment was partly aimed. Grosjean v. American Press Co., supra, 297 U.S. at pages 244-249, 56 S.Ct. at pages 446-449. They may indeed operate even more subtly. Itinerant evangelists moving throughout a state or from state to state would feel immediately the cumulative effect of such ordinances as they become fashionable. The way of the religious dissenter has long been hard. But if the formula of this type of ordinance is approved, a new device for the suppression of religious minorities will have been found. This method of disseminating religious beliefs can be crushed and closed out by the sheer weight of the toll or tribute which is exacted town by town, village by village. The spread of religious ideas through personal visitations by the literature ministry of numerous religious groups would be stopped. \n \n The fact that the ordinance is 'nondiscriminatory' is immaterial. The protection afforded by the First Amendment is not so restricted. A license tax certainly does not acquire constitutional validity because it classifies the privileges protected by the First Amendment along with the wares and merchandise of hucksters and peddlers and treats them all alike. Such equality in treatment does not save the ordinance. Freedom of press, freedom of speech, freedom of religion are in a preferred position. \n \n It is claimed, however, that the ultimate question in determining the constitutionality of this license tax is whether the state has given something for which it can ask a return. That principle has wide applicability. State Tax Commission v. Aldrich, 316 U.S. 174 , 62 S.Ct. 1008, 139 A.L.R. 1436, and cases cited. But it is quite irrelevant here. This tax is not a charge for the enjoyment of a privilege or benefit bestowed by the state. The privilege in question exists apart from state authority. It is guaranteed the people by the federal constitution. \n \n \n\n \n That is 10 cases ruling no tax or registration to exercise a Fundamental right.\n \n If you have any proof, now would be the time to present it :)\n \n And you make me think of a mentally retarded person wearing themselves out pushing against a door that says PULL on it.\n The constitution does not protect us from stupidity. It was not designed to. Tyranny, yes. Malice, maybe.

Let's show them the truth so they can decide for themselves if you are being honest with your claim of Total Gun Registration by our Founders. emoticon_smile \n \n \nThe Militia Act that you cited suggests says nothing that would suggest registration of firearms is, or even was, constitutional. Taking stock doesn't mean the same thing as maintaining a list of people's names, addresses, ages, marital status, height, weight, eye color, gender, type of guns, number of guns, make, model, manufacturer and serial number.\n\n \nYes, it does. People were punished with fines or even jail for failing to have the weapons that the law required, so common sense would dictate that they DID know exactly who had what where. I doubt they kept addresses because addresses did not come into use until much later. Nor was a serial number likely recorded because guns at the time were not serialized. \n \n The founders had no fear of the government knowing what arms they owned, how many they had, or where they were, because the federal government that they created (which bears almost no resemblance to the one we have today) had no standing army and almost no police powers. \n\n \nInventory is NOT Gun Registration. It is an Inventory. Quartermaster stuff.\n \n Prove that guns were registered like you claim. You are the one who said it, then claimed you proved it before. \n\n \nI have proved it here...in this thread. The milita act of 1792 specifically requires that the AG of the local militia keep those records. \n\n \nNOPE! I am saying that the Militia act nor the other post Galileo posted is not gun registration, which you claim it is.\n \n   Militia Act of 1792, \na sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints, and a knapsack, a pouch, with a box therein, to contain not less than twenty four cartridges, suited to the bore of his musket or firelock, each cartridge to contain a proper quantity of powder and ball; or with a good rifle, knapsack, shot-pouch, and powder-horn, twenty balls suited to the bore of his rifle, and a quarter of a pound of powder;\n\n So is all of this is registered too? \n\n \nYep. Pretty much. \n\n \n   I asked here, if this is what you guys want?  Let me ask again. Is this what you are after? If so, we likely have no problem then.\n \n Go ahead. Dance away, on a pinhead, if you must. This is a total misconstruction, in order to try and say that our Founding Fathers required U.S. Government to required all guns in America to be registered. Let me first ask, is THAT what you are saying? I very sincerely don't want to put any words in your mouth!",

   "I&#8217;m not ready to claim that SCOTUS would declare registration unconstitutional. When the issue was individual RKBA v. state&#8217;s right to arm militias or the hybrid collectivized individual right to carry in militia service I knew history and the law were on my side. The answer is not nearly so clear with registration. Yet as a matter of principle I still think registration is a terrible idea. \n \n If the government has no control over what I do, then I believe the government has no right to know what I do. For example, if I choose to drive this weekend to Maryland or North Carolina, should I need to inform the government of my travel plans? Or if I choose to blog here tomorrow night, then must I first tell the government of my plans? If what I am doing is lawful, and my government cannot stop me from doing it, then why do some people think a government official should be allowed to keep a record of what I am doing? \n \n Who here disagrees with this argument?\n \n Before anyone answers let me say this: I know that the four who were in the minority in Heller&#8212;and of those four the three who were left after one retired who also dissented in McDonald&#8212;have all agreed with my principle in the past when the issue dealt with rights they personally favored. The case is Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of Stratton, 536 U.S. 150 (2002), and it involved registration and 1st. Amendment freedoms.\n \n The issue in the case was: \n \n Respondent Village of Stratton (Village) promulgated an ordinance that, inter alia, prohibits &#8220;canvassers&#8221; from &#8220;going in and upon&#8221; private residential property to promote any &#8220;cause&#8221; without first obtaining a permit from the mayor's office by completing and signing a registration form. Petitioners, a society and a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses that publish and distribute religious materials, brought this action for injunctive relief, alleging that the ordinance violates their First Amendment rights to the free exercise of religion, free speech, and freedom of the press.\n \n The ultimate ruling was:\n \n Held: The ordinance's provisions making it a misdemeanor to engage in door-to-door advocacy without first registering with the mayor and receiving a permit violate the First Amendment as it applies to religious proselytizing, anonymous political speech, and the distribution of handbills.\n \n The breakdown of who ruled how is here:\n \n STEVENS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which O'CONNOR, KENNEDY, SOUTER, GINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ., joined. BREYER, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which SOUTER and GINSBURG, JJ., joined, post, p. 169. SCALIA, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which THOMAS, J., joined, post, p. 171. REHNQUIST, C. J., filed a dissenting opinion\n \n Here are some highlights of what this Stevens-led majority said....\n \n Starting with a reference to an earlier case:\n \n (citing Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516 (1945)). In Thomas, the issue was whether a labor leader could be required to obtain a permit before delivering a speech to prospective union members. After reviewing the Jehovah's Witnesses cases discussed above, the Court observed: [Page 164]\n \n &#8220;As a matter of principle a requirement of registration in order to make a public speech would seem generally incompatible with an exercise of the rights of free speech and free assembly. . . .\n \n . . . . .\n \n &#8220;If the exercise of the rights of free speech and free assembly cannot be made a crime, we do not think this can be accomplished by the device of requiring previous registration as a condition for exercising them and making such a condition the foundation for restraining in advance their exercise and for imposing a penalty for violating such a restraining order. So long as no more is involved than exercise of the rights of free speech and free assembly, it is immune to such a restriction. If one who solicits support for the cause of labor may be required to register as a condition to the exercise of his right to make a public speech, so may he who seeks to rally support for any social, business, religious or political cause. We think a requirement that one must register before he undertakes to make a public speech to enlist support for a lawful movement is quite incompatible with the requirements of the First Amendment.&#8221; Id., at 539-540. (bold emphasis added by me)\n \n Pause here for a moment. Now doesn&#8217;t this logic also apply to one who must register before he may freely exercise his RKBA? Consider also what follows later in the opinion:\n \n It is offensive &#8212; not only to [Page 166] the values protected by the First Amendment, but to the very notion of a free society &#8212; that in the context of everyday public discourse a citizen must first inform the government of her desire to speak to her neighbors and then obtain a permit to do so. (bold emphasis added by me)\n \n Again, wouldn&#8217;t this logic also apply to a citizen who must first inform the government of his decision to exercise his RKBA? Ah, but some may say this case involved a &#8220;permit&#8221; system that might restrict the right (either by willful denial of the permit by a hostile official or by an excessive fee involved)&#8212;whereas they can imagine registration that would be automatic and free of charge and which would not prevent the free exercise of the RKBA. I think the following language gets to the heart of the privacy issue involved, and renders that distinction moot: \n \n Even if the issuance of permits by the mayor's office is a ministerial task that is performed promptly and at no cost to the applicant, a law requiring a permit to engage in such speech constitutes a dramatic departure from our national heritage and constitutional tradition. Three obvious examples illustrate the pernicious effect of such a permit requirement. (bold emphasis added by me)\n \n First, as our cases involving distribution of unsigned handbills demonstrate,13 there are a significant number of persons who support causes anonymously.14 &#8220;The decision in favor of anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or official retaliation, by concern about social ostracism, or merely by a desire to preserve as much of one's privacy as possible.&#8221; McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U.S., at 341-342. The requirement that a canvasser must be identified in a permit application filed in the mayor's office and available for public inspection necessarily results in a surrender of that anonymity&#8230;.(bold emphasis added by me)\n \n Doesn&#8217;t my desire to preserve as much privacy as possible and to remain anonymous about the nature and number of firearms I own deserve the same protection? Or to put it another way: If a right to go door to door canvassing for votes or in support of my religious beliefs&#8212;something that puts me in full view of the public or any police officer who happens to drive down the same street&#8212;is a privacy interest deserving protection from registration with a public official, then shouldn&#8217;t keeping a handgun in my nightstand&#8212;something my neighbors cannot know without breaking into my home, and that the police should never know without the aid of a search warrant for my home&#8212;be a privacy interest worth the same protection? \n \n See also the SCOTUS majority&#8217;s claim that a registration scheme&#8212;even if it is fairly administered without additional cost&#8212;carries a deterrent effect:\n \n Second, requiring a permit as a prior condition on the exercise of the right to speak imposes an objective burden on some speech of citizens holding religious or patriotic views. As our World War II-era cases dramatically demonstrate, there are a significant number of persons whose religious scruples will prevent them from applying for such a license. There are no doubt other patriotic citizens, who have such firm convictions about their constitutional right to engage in uninhibited debate in the context of door-to-door advocacy, that they would prefer silence to speech licensed by a petty official.  (bold emphasis added by me)\n \n I would say watch out here&#8212;Stevens is overreaching his argument&#8217;s logic to reach the desired result, and Scalia scoffed at the fictional &#8220;patriotic citizens&#8221; example in his concurrence. But two of the original Heller dissenters remain on the Court, and this was the argument they adopted in this earlier case. Wouldn&#8217;t they also have to agree that the same &#8220;deterrent effect&#8221; applies to registration of the free exercise of the RKBA? After all, aren&#8217;t you antis always claiming that we are paranoid anyway&#8212;and under your argument registration of firearms would have an even greater chilling effect on the free exercise of the RKBA? Finally:\n \n Third, there is a significant amount of spontaneous speech that is effectively banned by the ordinance. A person who made a decision on a holiday or a weekend to take an active part in a political campaign could not begin to pass out handbills until after he or she obtained the required permit&#8230;.\n \n This third example from the case does not seem to apply to the RKBA (I could easily argue for a registration scheme that would evade the third issue raised), but I include it anyway in the interests of being complete.\n \n Now with all this in mind, consider what Stevens (thankfully retired) also wrote in McDonald:\n \n To the extent that petitioners contend the city of Chicago's registration requirements for firearm possessors also, and separately, violate the Constitution, that claim borders on the frivolous. Petitioners make no effort to demonstrate that the requirements are unreasonable or that they impose a severe burden on the underlying right they have asserted.McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___ 081521, 57 (2010)\n \n I have difficulty understanding why registration of first amendment rights is different from registration of the RKBA under the logic used to decide the Watchtower case. But apparently Stevens&#8217; standard is this: If I like the right involved then any registration imposes an &#8220;objective burden&#8221; and is unconstitutional, but if I really don&#8217;t like the right then registration does not impose a &#8220;severe burden&#8221; and registration is OK. \n \n The only differense I can find is his personal bias for or agains the indiviudal rights involved. For the one he favors protecting, the term &#8220;objective burden&#8221; should really read \"any far-fetched burden I can possibly dream up to use to invalidate the registration scheme.\" For the RKBA he disfavors the term &#8220;severe burden&#8221; should read \"I'm good with any burden you put on the free exercise of this thing becaue I don't like the @#$%&! right in the first place.\" \n \n Anyone else want to take a crack at reconciling the inconsistencies of these two opinions?",

I realize I can't change the views of those who already made it to the court, and they will turn a deaf ear to me when I try. These justices simply will not listen to me (or Scalia, for that matter) tell them they are wrong. But to maintain any shred of credibility they must listen when we use their own logic against them. \n \n Breyer is still on the court and has voted to gut Heller. Now that Stevens is gone he is the torchbearer for the anti-gun movement on the court. He writes the anti-gun opinions that others join (including Sotomayor, who did so after promising during confirmation that she would not do so). I'm targeting him right now because he has a long enough track record of opinions I can use against him. I know what he has said before, and I am not willing to let him forget what he has said just because he wants to reach a different result involving the RKBA. If a registration case comes before him then I want to remind him of this: \n \n If the exercise of the rights of free speech and free assembly cannot be made a crime, we do not think this can be accomplished by the device of requiring previous registration as a condition for exercising them and making such a condition the foundation for restraining in advance their exercise and for imposing a penalty for violating such a restraining order. So long as no more is involved than exercise of the rights of free speech and free assembly, it is immune to such a restriction. If one who solicits support for the cause of labor may be required to register as a condition to the exercise of his right to make a public speech, so may he who seeks to rally support for any social, business, religious or political cause. We think a requirement that one must register before he undertakes to make a public speech to enlist support for a lawful movement is quite incompatible with the requirements of the First Amendment.\n \n Now he didn't write this, Stevens did. And Stevens is only quoting from an earlier case that happened before any of them were ever elevated to the SCOTUS bench. But by joining Stevens' opinion without comment he has adopted this logic as his own, and I am ready to argue back at him this:\n \n \"If the exercise of the right to keep and bear arms cannot be made a crime, we do not think this can be accomplished by the device of requiring previous registration as a condition for exercising that right and making such a condition the foundation for restraining in advance its exercise and for imposing a penalty for violating such a restraining order. So long as no more is involved than exercise of the right to keep and bear arms, it is immune to such a restriction. We think a requirement that one must register before he undertakes to lawfully possess a firearm is quite incompatible with the requirements of the Second Amendment.\"\n \n And if he wishes to reject this application of his own logic and say registration of the RKBA is still OK then it will be up to him to figure out how to justify the exercise of Orwellian doublethink. I know he will try, and I want to undermine his credibility by showing how his constitutional principles have an on-off switch depending on which right is involved. \n \n He will also talk of competing interests-the \"legitimate\" government concerns over the evils the law is designed to prevent v. the \"legitimate\" individual RKBA or privacy interests the law encroaches upon, and he will try to justify registration by saying there are no less restrictive means for the government to accomplish its goal.\n \n So that's my next question. Why doesn't someone who favors registration give us a proposal that we can look at, and let us debate how Breyer should balance the interests involved? That's would give us a window into how he is going to do it if it ever comes up....\n \n ---\n \n The issue, however, is not whether court rules are \"mutable\"; they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of \"various circumstances,\" they can be \"modifi[ed]\"; they assuredly can. The issue is whether, as mutated and modified, they must make sense. The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.

Tell me if I have guessed wrong&#8230;.\n \n I understand what you imply&#8212;that the phrase &#8221;If the exercise of the right to keep and bear arms cannot be made a crime&#8221; cannot apply to the RKBA because some exercises of the right are made into crimes (like possession by felons).\n \n Go back to the original from Stevens&#8217; opinion:\n \n If the exercise of the rights of free speech and free assembly cannot be made a crime, we do not think this can be accomplished by the device of requiring previous registration as a condition for exercising them and making such a condition the foundation for restraining in advance their exercise and for imposing a penalty for violating such a restraining order. So long as no more is involved than exercise of the rights of free speech and free assembly, it is immune to such a restriction. \n \n At the time this was written there were (and still are) examples of conduct we would call speech and assembly that were also crimes&#8212;and yet this language &#8220;exercise of the rights cannot be made a crime&#8221; was used. This is because no right is absolute, and the Court is not saying every act of speech or assembly is protected. The same applies to firearms&#8212;not every possession or act done while possessing them is protected. Your example of prohibited person possession is no more included within the RKBA than yelling &#8220;fire&#8221; in a crowded theater is included within the right of free speech or mob violence and riot is included in the free assembly clause&#8212;and yet the language I quoted from Stevens' opinion applies equally to all these rights. \n \n This is so because the language &#8220;exercise of the rights&#8221; was used by men who at the very least understand that no right is absolute. They are not talking about all possible acts that could be called &#8220;speech&#8221; or &#8220;assembly&#8221; but rather about the specific activities the court has recognized as falling within the scope of actions the rights were written into the Constitution to protect. \n \n What Steven&#8217;s is saying, and what I am trying to apply equally to the RKBA, is this: If the particular act involved cannot be made a crime (that is, if the activity fits within the scope of the protected right), then that activity is an exercise of the right and &#8220;is immune to such a restriction&#8221; as registration. \n \n My argument is this: If my possession of a firearm falls within the protected scope of the right that Heller has outlined, then Stevens&#8217; argument (as adopted by Breyer) should make that activity immune from registration.",

Right now all the traces I have seen are run on individual firearms, not on owners (but it can be done that way). Traces are run when we recover a firearm suspected of being used in a crime and we think it is important to know who purchased the firearm. It is very rare that traces are run in my jurisdiction because the information obtained is of limited value in prosecutions. But if we think it could help then we ask ATF to start the trace on a firearm with a particular serial number. ATF contacts the manufacturer, and the manufacturer looks at its shipping information and tells ATF which FFL dealer it shipped the gun to. Then ATF contacts the FFL dealer and requests the 4473 form filled out for the purchase of that firearm. The dealer consults his \"bound volume\" of all his 4473 forms, finds the correct one, and he sends a copy of it to ATF which then forwards the information from the form (names, address, DoB, SS# of purchaser) to the local law enforcement agency. \n \n To answer the question of how would one know where to find the records of a particular person's purchases by a name search, consider the following from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923:\n \n B) The Attorney General may inspect or examine the inventory and records of a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer without such reasonable cause or warrant -\n \n (i) in the course of a reasonable inquiry during the course of a criminal investigation of a person or persons other than the licensee.\n \n This is written so broadly that if the attorney general started a criminal investigation of a person, then the attorney general could search through every FFL dealers \"bound volumes\" of 4473 forms for the name of the person it is looking for, or it could conceivably send out a demand to every FFL dealer in the nation requiring each dealer to submit any information it has on that person, then each dealer would have to search through every 4473 form it kept in the \"bound volumes\" at the gun stores, and each dealer would have to tell the government about every firearm purchase that person had ever made with that dealer. \n \n Whichever method is used, this would be how the federal government could pick a name and search for every FFL dealer firearm transaction under that name.... \n \n I don't know if any challenges have been made to the current scheme. As I believe Rick noted, the current system was a compromise, and I believe it has generally been accepted because we have not heard of any abuses of the system that were significant enough to create a great deal of opposition to it-and, from the stand point of a RKBA violation, remember we are only about two years into the era of SCOTUS finally telling us \"yes, Virginia, you do have an individual RKBA\" and therefore possess standing to raise a challenge to this system on RKBA grounds. \n \n Finally, remember Justice Thomas has already hinted once before that he is open to considering a challenge to the current regulatory scheme:\n \n The Constitution, in addition to delegating certain enumerated powers to Congress, places whole areas outside the reach of Congress' regulatory authority. The First Amendment, for example, is fittingly celebrated for preventing Congress from \"prohibiting the free exercise\" of religion or \"abridging the freedom of speech.\" The Second Amendment similarly appears to contain an express limitation on the government's authority. That Amendment provides: \"[a] well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" This Court has not had recent occasion to consider the nature of the substantive right safeguarded by the Second Amendment. If, however, the Second Amendment is read to confer a personal right to \"keep and bear arms,\" a colorable argument exists that the Federal Government's regulatory scheme, at least as it pertains to the purely intrastate sale or possession of firearms, runs afoul of that Amendment's protections. As the parties did not raise this argument, however, we need not consider it here. Perhaps, at some future date, this Court will have the opportunity to determine whether Justice Story was correct when he wrote that the right to bear arms \"has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic.\" 3 J. Story, Commentaries \u00ba 1890, p. 746 (1833). In the meantime, I join the Court's opinion striking down the challenged provisions of the Brady Act as inconsistent with the Tenth Amendment.

Do we not use scrutiny as our guide? \n\n \n \nI suggest you use the original meaning of the constitution. Now I realize you are rather liberal when it comes to judges and the constitution so this isn't convincing but if you stick within the original meaning you have your answers.\n \n \n \nI'll break it down really simple for you...\n \n Originalism:\n \n Freedom of speech means exactly what it meant when written which included symbolic speech. This is evidenced easily in the common law of the time, written documents, and to some extent early court cases.\n \n Strict Scrutiny: \n \n Came about around the time of the new deal and the idea of a \"living constitution\" (early stages). Basically states that Freedom of Speech doesn't mean what it says but rather restrictions have to be bounced off the judges to see if they feel it has enough \"purpose\" to be allowed. What rights get strict scrutiny or rational basis or whatever is completely subjective. What exceptions have a good enough purpose is completely subjective. It is basically a legislative role. So if you get a question about symbolic speech 5 judges might think giving the finger is mean and surely we can restrict being mean so it passes the test. Afterall, the test has no criteria based in law.\n\n You call me Liberal, because you think it suits you.

How could the armed citizen be effective against a rouge government, if that government knew where all guns were? Would they not just start collecting them just before they went rouge? \n \n Given the fact that gun registration infringed upon Mr. Haynes 5th Amendment Rights, would this not be an infringement on the 2nd Amendment as you see the 2nd Amendment to be?

Where ALL guns are registered and they even sent police into each gun owner's home to make sure that they were secured properly.\n \n  Shocking: The guns of Sydney \nThe three gun runners didn't care who was buying their lethal weapons or what they were going to do with them. All they wanted was the cash.\n \n In cafes, backs of cars, even in the car park of a Wollongong hotel in daylight, Aristos Dionys, Michael Zarakas and Andrew Kafizas traded thousands of dollars for machineguns and assault weapons -- the tools of trade for professional killers.\n\n Note the cute title of this next expose. emoticon_smile \n    Serious crimes of a different calibre \n IN the past year police have seized 3200 firearms.

Most of these thefts netted one or two firearms, primarily from private homes.\n \n Dr Samantha Bricknell from the institute said police recovered 13 per cent of stolen guns in 2007-08.\n \n \"Up to 70 per cent of firearms reported stolen each year are not recovered and this remains a major concern,\" Dr Bricknell said.\n \n The latest report by the Australian Crime Commission said the trade of illegal weapons was vital to organised crime groups, who use firearms to carry out their criminal activity and strengthen their position.\n \n \"Traffickers play a key role in supplying weapons. They use diverse and sophisticated methods to source and supply weapons that are illegally imported, stolen or diverted from the legitimate market,\" the report said.\n \n Last month 20 handguns were stolen from a storage facility in Yennora, west of Sydney. Police said the handguns were last seen locked in a safe inside the storage container.

UNITED STATES, 390 U.S. 85 (1968)   \n Do the criminals have more Rights than the Law Abiding? Do criminals have a 5th amendment Right and we don't?\n\n \n I'm not ready to include any justices in an anti-registration camp yet. I still feel very uncertain of how any one of them would rule-except that IMO Breyer would almost certainly want to find a way to justify registration, and I think Sotomayor would follow him now that she has revealed she never really believed in the individual RKBA announced by Heller. \n \n I agree the 5th. Amendment can pose a problem for registration, and I have suggested this before. But the 5th. Amendment privilege against self-incrimination has never been read in absolute terms, and SCOTUS has declared that the privilege exists only where the disclosure creates a \"real and appreciable\" risk of incrimination (ie. prosecution for some crime the government learns about because of your disclosure). \n \n This was the issue in Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88-89 (1968). The registration scheme was:\n \n All these taxes are supplemented by comprehensive requirements calculated to assure their collection. Any individual who wishes to make a weapon, within the meaning of \u00a7 5821 (a), is obliged, \"prior to such making,\" to declare his intention to the Secretary, and to provide to the Treasury his fingerprints and photograph. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5821(e); Treas. Reg. \u00a7 179.78. The declaration must be \"supported by a certificate of the local chief of police . . . or such other person whose certificate may . . . be acceptable . . . .\" Treas. Reg. \u00a7 179.78. The certificate must indicate satisfaction that the fingerprints and photograph are those of the declarant, and that the firearm is intended \"for lawful purposes.\" Ibid. Any person who wishes to transfer such a weapon may lawfully do so only [Page 89] if he first obtains a written order from the prospective transferee on an \"application form issued . . . for that purpose by the Secretary.\" 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5814(a). The application, supported by a certificate of the local chief of police, and accompanied by the transferee's fingerprints and photograph, must be approved by the Secretary prior to the transfer. Treas. Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 179.98, 179.99. Finally, every person possessing such a firearm is obliged to register his possession with the Secretary, unless he made the weapon, or acquired it by transfer or importation, and the Act's requirements as to transfers, makings, and importations \"were complied with.\" 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5841.5\n \n Failure to comply with any of the Act's requirements is made punishable by fines and imprisonment. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861. In addition, \u00a7 5851 creates a series of supplementary offenses; it declares unlawful the possession of any firearm which has \"at any time\" been transferred or made in violation of the Act's provisions, or which \"has not been registered as required by section 5841.\" Finally, \u00a7 5851 provides that in prosecutions conducted under that section \"possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such possession to the satisfaction of the jury.\"\n \n This is how the Court viewed the registration scheme:\n \n The obligation to register is conditioned simply upon possession of a firearm, within the meaning of \u00a7 5848 (1). Not every possessor of a firearm must, however, register; one who made the firearm, or acquired it by transfer or importation, need not register if the Act's provisions as to transfers, makings, and importations \"were complied with.\" If those requirements were not met, or if the possessor did not make the firearm, and did not acquire it by transfer or importation, he must furnish the Secretary of the Treasury with his name, address, the place where the firearm is usually kept, and the place of his business or employment. Further, he must indicate his date of birth, social security number, and whether he has ever been convicted of a felony. Finally, he must provide a full description of the firearm. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5841; Treas. Reg. \u00a7 179.120; Internal Revenue Service Form 1 (Firearms).\n \n The registration requirement is thus directed principally at those persons who have obtained possession of a firearm without complying with the Act's other requirements, and who therefore are immediately threatened by criminal prosecutions under \u00a7\u00a7 5851 and 5861. They are unmistakably persons \"inherently suspect of criminal activities.\" Albertson v. SACB, 382 U.S. 70, 79. It is true, as the United States emphasizes, that registration is not invariably indicative of a violation of the Act's requirements; there are situations, which the United States itself styles \"uncommon,\"10 in which a possessor [Page 97] who has not violated the Act's other provisions is obliged to register.11 Nonetheless, the correlation between obligations to register and violations can only be regarded as exceedingly high, and a prospective registrant realistically can expect that registration will substantially increase the likelihood of his prosecution. Moreover, he can reasonably fear that the possession established by his registration will facilitate his prosecution under the making and transfer clauses of \u00a7 5851. In these circumstances, it can scarcely be said that the risks of criminal prosecution confronted by prospective registrants are \"remote possibilities out of the ordinary course of law,\" Heike v. United States, 227 U.S. 131, 144; yet they are compelled, on pain of criminal prosecution, to provide to the Secretary both a formal acknowledgment of their possession of firearms, and supplementary information likely to facilitate their arrest and eventual conviction. The hazards of incrimination created by the registration requirement can thus only be termed \"real and appreciable.\" Reg. v. Boyes, 1 B. & S. 311, 330; Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 599-600.\n \n The ultimate ruling that we are concerned with was this:\n \n We hold that a proper claim of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination provides a full defense to prosecutions either for failure to register a firearm under \u00a7 5841 or for possession of an unregistered firearm under \u00a7 5851.\n \n Now consider a better statement of the principles involved in the privilege against self-incrimination: \n \n Of course, the Government may not insulate inquiries designed to produce incriminating information merely by [Page 709] labeling the inquiry a necessary incident of a regulatory scheme. Where the essence of a statutory scheme is to forbid a given class of activities, it may not be enforced by requiring individuals to report their violations. See Marchetti, supra; Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85 (1968); Albertson v. SACB, 382 U.S. 70 (1965). But where the statutory scheme is not designed to forbid certain acts, but only to require that they be done in a certain way, the Government may enforce its requirements by a compulsory scheme of reporting, directed at all who engage in those activities, and not on its face designed simply to elicit incriminating information. Shapiro v. United States, supra; see Albertson v. SACB, supra, at 77-80. Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 708-709 (1971) \n Viewed in this light, then, Marchetti and Grosso are the outgrowth of two principles inapplicable to the problem at hand. The first is that when a given class of activities is, in the main, made criminal by either state or federal law, an individual may not be compelled to disclose whether he engages in activities within the class unless his disclosure is compensated by the requisite grant of immunity.9 Marchetti, supra; Haynes v. United States, supra; Albertson v. SACB, supra. The second is that such individuals may likewise not be compelled. absent sufficient immunity, to disclose the details of their activities within such a suspect class: for if the mere admission of engaging in any of a class of activities is sufficiently likely to lead to criminal prosecution that the privilege against self-incrimination may be invoked, [Page 710] admission of the details of these activities is a fortiori likely to lead to incrimination. Grosso, supra. Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 709-710 (1971)\n \n Congress amended the statute after Haynes was decided, and SCOTUS took a look at the new registration scheme and declared that it did not violate the privilege against self-incrimination. The case was United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 605-606 (1971):\n \n In Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, the Court held invalid under the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment provisions of the National Firearms Act, which constituted parts of an interrelated statutory scheme for taxing certain classes of firearms primarily used for unlawful purposes, and made the potentially incriminating information available to state and other officials. To eliminate the defects revealed by Haynes, Congress amended the Act so that only a possessor who lawfully makes, manufactures, or imports firearms can and must register them. The transferor must identify himself, describe the firearm, and give the name and address of the transferee, whose application must be supported by fingerprints and a photograph and a law enforcement official's certificate identifying them as those of the transferee and stating that the weapon is intended for lawful uses. Only after the transferor's receipt of the approved application form may the firearm transfer be legally made. A transferee does not and cannot register, though possession of an unregistered firearm is illegal. No information or evidence furnished under the Act can be used as evidence against a registrant or applicant \"in a criminal proceeding with respect to a violation of law occurring prior to or concurrently with the filing of the application or registration, or the compiling of the records containing the information or evidence,\" and no information filed is, as a matter of administration, disclosed to other federal, local, or state agencies.... \n \n \n We conclude that the amended Act does not violate the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment which provides that no person \"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\" As noted, a lawful transfer of a firearm may be accomplished only if it is already registered. The transferor - not the transferee - does the registering. The transferor pays the transfer tax and receives a stamp7 denoting payment which he affixes to the application submitted to the Internal Revenue Service. The transferor must identify himself, describe the firearm to be transferred, and the name and address of the transferee. In addition, the application must be supported by the photograph and fingerprints of the transferee and by a certificate of a local or federal law enforcement official that he is satisfied that the photograph and fingerprints are those of the transferee and that the weapon is intended for lawful uses.8 Only after receipt of the approved application form is it lawful for the transferor to hand the firearm over to the transferee. At that time he is to give the approved application to the transferee.9 As noted, the Solicitor General advises us that the information in the hands of Internal Revenue Service, as a matter of practice, is not available to state or other federal authorities [Page 606] and, as a matter of law, cannot be used as evidence in a criminal proceeding with respect to a prior or concurrent violation of law.10\n \n The transferor - not the transferee - makes any incriminating statements. True, the transferee, if he wants the firearm, must cooperate to the extent of supplying fingerprints and photograph. But the information he supplies makes him the lawful, not the unlawful, possessor of the firearm. Indeed, the only transferees who may lawfully receive a firearm are those who have not committed crimes in the past. The argument, however, is that furnishing the photograph and fingerprints will incriminate the transferee in the future. But the claimant is not confronted by \"substantial and 'real'\" but merely \"trifling or imaginary hazards of incrimination\" - first by reason of the statutory barrier against use in a prosecution for prior or concurrent offenses, and second by reason of the unavailability of the registration data, as a matter of administration, to local, state, and other federal agencies. Marchetti v. United States, supra, at 53-54. Cf. Minor v. United States, 396 U.S. 87, 94. Since the state and other federal agencies never see the information, he is left in the same position as if he had not given it, but \"had claimed his privilege in the absence of a . . . grant of immunity.\" Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U.S. 52, 79. This, combined with the protection against use to prove prior or concurrent offenses, satisfies the Fifth Amendment requirements respecting self-incrimination....\n \n So there are ways to get around the self-incrimination problem-like the grant of use/derivative use immunity for the act of disclosing as discussed in Freed. But, as I see it, any attempt to force felons to register firearms they possess without a guarantee that their disclosure cannot result in prosecution would violate the privilege against self-incrimination.",

   "From the originalist perceptive I'm not sure the 5th amendment creates any problem with registration. The part of this Haynes case that was a problem was one of the questions to fill out. That has nothing to do with the idea of registration. In an extreme example, if gun registration required that you agree to become a slave to the federal government, required to live in the slums of DC with no pay, and eat out of a can than this imposes a constitution problem. You are required to have other rights violated for the purposes of a gun right. Such is the case with Haynes.\n \n My point is, if you have gun registration where you are required to give your name, type of weapon, location normally kept than I can't see how this would violate any 5th amendment right or 2nd amendment right.\n\n \n Let me give you an example for the 5th. Amendment. \n \n A and B both live in Virginia, and both have a firearm they keep in their homes. Congress passes the registration law you suggest and it requires all persons to register their firearms by giving your name, type of weapon, and location normally kept. \n \n Now to make registration work you have to make it more than a voluntary &#8220;we really wish you would tell us&#8221; request. You have to make it a command that&#8217;s enforced by a penalty for failing to register. So let&#8217;s say the law punishes possession of an unregistered firearm by making it a felony offense with up to 2 years in prison. \n \n Let&#8217;s say Mr. A has no criminal record. Now let&#8217;s say Mr. B is a felon, having a conviction for maliciously wounding someone in the past because he once shot someone with a gun. \n Both men hear the news about the new law ordering them to register their firearms. \n \n Clearly, of the two men the one the government is most interested in knowing about is B. \n \n A does not want to get into trouble for having an unregistered firearm, so he goes in and registers his gun.\n \n B will never register his firearm&#8212;he is not going to tell the government that he has a gun because he is facing an automatic 5 year prison sentence just for having the gun, and there is no way he is going to walk into a government office and confess to this crime and tell the government exactly where to search to find the evidence of his crime. That is exactly what the registration requirement would force him to do. \n \n B is therefore thrust on the horns of a dilemma. He could always throw the gun into a river. But if he keeps it (and they always do) he must choose to either keep the gun hidden and risk 2 years for possession of an unregistered firearm plus 5 years for being a felon if he is ever caught with it, or, to avoid the possibility of 2 years imprisonment by registering his gun as required, he must go in and incriminate himself by telling the government that he has a gun at home. For this reason registration would require B to incriminate himself\n \n So now let&#8217;s say that that both A and B are friends, that they both refuse to register their firearms, that they are riding together in a car with their firearms, and they get pulled over and caught with the guns. A and B are both prosecuted for possessing an unregistered weapon. A gets found guilty because he has no legal defense&#8212;registration could not incriminate him, and he has to excuse for not registering his gun. B&#8217;s case is dismissed because prosecuting him for failure to register would violate his privilege against self-incrimination. (of course, he gets five years for having the gun, registered or not as a felon&#8212;and the end result is both A & B are now felons facing prison time). \n \n And really now, the government has no legitimate interest in knowing if A has a gun (absent some way to justify it under the congressional authority over the militias). B is the one the registration system is designed to detect and deter, and he is the one who gets the free pass from registration. \n \n Now the way to avoid this problem is to grant everyone use and derivative use immunity for anything they say on the registration form. That is, they can be prosecuted for failing to register only if the act of registration can never be used against them to prosecute other crimes (like possession by a felon). And so you tell B &#8220;it&#8217;s OK, come on down, we promise we can&#8217;t use this information against you in any trial for possession by a felon.&#8221; It sounds good enough in theory, but B will not come on down.\n \n He won&#8217;t come down because he has been through the system and he does not trust his government. He fears that if they know about his possession through his registration, even if they are forbidden from using his registration against him, then they will specifically target him in the future because they know he has a gun, and they will try every means possible to stop him in the future and search his car&#8212;or do whatever they can to get a search warrant for his home&#8212;on some other pretext so they can really go look for the gun they know is there but can&#8217;t do anything about yet. \n \n In the real world registration might end being nothing more than a way to create more felons out of otherwise honest gun owners who don&#8217;t understand the registration system enough to comply with it, while the felons the law is designed to deter will simply ignore the law altogether.",

That doesn't seem feasible to me.\n\n \n It's meant to be difficult on purpose.\n \n Here is the portion that the AG could use to require the FFLs to report transactions under a certain name:\n \n U.S. Code 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923 (g)(1)(a)\n \n Each licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, and licensed dealer shall maintain such records of importation, production, shipment, receipt, sale, or other disposition of firearms at his place of business for such period, and in such form, as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe. Such importers, manufacturers, and dealers shall not be required to submit to the Attorney General reports and information with respect to such records and the contents thereof, except as expressly required by this section....(bold emphasis added) \n \n Now see the express requirement listed here....\n \n \n U.S. Code 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923 (g)(5)(a)(b)\n \n (A) Each licensee shall, when required by letter issued by the Attorney General, and until notified to the contrary in writing by the Attorney General, submit on a form specified by the Attorney General, for periods and at the times specified in such letter, all record information required to be kept by this chapter or such lesser record information as the Attorney General in such letter may specify.\n \n (B) The Attorney General may authorize such record information to be submitted in a manner other than that prescribed in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph when it is shown by a licensee that an alternate method of reporting is reasonably necessary and will not unduly hinder the effective administration of this chapter. A licensee may use an alternate method of reporting if the licensee describes the proposed alternate method of reporting and the need therefor in a letter application submitted to the Attorney General, and the Attorney General approves such alternate method of reporting.\n \n This would allow the AG to send out a form letter to all FFLs asking them to report if they have ever sold a gun to a named individual.\n \n But you probably would not need to contact all FFLs. If I were the AG, and I were bent on trying to find out if a person has bought firearms, then I would first run a name search through a database like Accurint. Searches like this use public records (utilities, etc.) to help track people. The search would tell the AG where the person has lived from when to when with a fair degree of accuracy, and you could narrow the search to gun dealers within a certain driving radius of the homes he lived in or rented. This would give you a very accurate picture of the number and types of guns he has bought (assuming he didn't drop out of the system altogether by using a straw man to make his purchases....)",

Not even close.\n\n \n And you might never have a need to consult an attorney before talking to the police. However that doesn't invalidate your right to counsel, nor should it.\n \n \nThat's why this Country is so screwed up.. People living in the past and clinging to a 200 some odd year old Constitution that the Government tramples on whenever they see fit... Ever read the Patriot Act?...\n\n \n To the best of my knowledge the Supreme Court has never ruled that the Patriot Act was constitutional and thus perfectly legal in nature. That means at any time a case can arise and tear it down completely, and put the government is a very difficult position from here on out. It's all just a matter of time.\n \n And no, the country isn't screwed up because we believe in the Constitution. Although I'd love to see your argument as to why you believe this nonsense you spout.\n \n \nNeither is owning a gun.\n\n \n Actually it is. And we have two Supreme Court cases saying so. Owning a gun is a fundamental, individual, constitutionally recognized and protected right. That's a matter of settled law now, and everyone has to accept it as fact. They have no other recourse available to them, anymore than atheists have recourse for outlawing all manner of religion.\n \n \nMy Point was that the Government makes up Laws all the time to fit their needs, it will be the same when they require guns to be registered.\n\n \n And a lot of those laws get struck down because we DO have the constitution.\n \n \nA large part of our current Laws are derived from the Constitution.. Laws that need to be passed aren't because of the Constitution.. It can be changed .. people just have to want Change.\n\n \n Except for the fact that the change itself has to be constitutional in nature. And good luck with that.\n \n \nAs far as I know there is nothing in the constitution that forbids changing things as needed to keep up with Society changes.\n\n \n And so far your \"as far as I know\" has been full of errors and gross misconceptions when it's come to stating your opinion on things.\n \n There's simply nothing in the Constitution, or the words of the Founding Fathers, to suggest that the Constitution itself was meant to be twisted into a hammer to be used against the people anytime they didn't want to fall in line with government policy like good little drones, eager to jump off the cliff like lemmings headed for the sea.\n \n \nSo someone who is known to be crazy enough to go on a shooting spree but has never actually been arrested should be able to buy a gun ?..lol..\n\n \n So you're advocating a standard of prior restraint? A practice of \"everyone is guilty, no exceptions, until they prove beyond a shadow of a doubt otherwise\"?\n \n Perhaps you should be locked up right this minute until you can prove that you're not a serial killer or a child molester.\n \n \nWhat does registering a gun have to do with anyone's Privacy?\n\n \n It's my right, I'll exercise it if I want. Whether or not I exercise it is my business and my business alone. The government has no authority, nor business, to know how I exercise my constitutional rights. They can't make me tell them which version of the Bible I own, or if I own a copy of the Quran, or the Torah, etc. and they can't require me to disclose which legally acquirable firearms I might have in my possession.\n \n \nYou have to register for school, Social Security, Medical insurance, and more\n\n \n None of which are a right recognized by the Constitution.\n \n \nif they already have everything about you what is a gun registration going to do to intrude on anyone\"s Privacy..lol\n\n \n Do you have to register to own and operate a blog? Do you have to disclose which political groups you belong to? Do you have to seek government permission before buying kitchen knives? Do you need to register your baseball bat so you can prove you didn't murder someone with it? Do you have to register a non-motorized method of transport? Do you have to disclose your sexual partners for review? Do you have to notify the government every time you want to buy birth control products?",

   "For this reason registration would require B to incriminate himself\n \n So now let's say that that both A and B are friends, that they both refuse to register their firearms, that they are riding together in a car with their firearms, and they get pulled over and caught with the guns. A and B are both prosecuted for possessing an unregistered weapon. A gets found guilty because he has no legal defense-registration could not incriminate him, and he has to excuse for not registering his gun. B's case is dismissed because prosecuting him for failure to register would violate his privilege against self-incrimination. (of course, he gets five years for having the gun, registered or not as a felon-and the end result is both A & B are now felons facing prison time). \nYeah, that this is a big stretch in my opinion. The 5th amendment clearly speaks to being \"compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\". Are we going to say sex-offender registration is self-incrimination because if they are living within a few hundred feet of a school they would be turning themselves in? I don't think so. \n \n \nIn the real world registration might end being nothing more than a way to create more felons out of otherwise honest gun owners who don't understand the registration system enough to comply with it, while the felons the law is designed to deter will simply ignore the law altogether.\nI'm not saying registration has a good purpose, I'm saying \"good purpose\" is not a constitutional requirement for anything.",

   "Appeals Court: Government Can Require Gun Registration - Taking Liberties - CBS News\n\n \n Check the date. This case was decided BEFORE McDonald V Chicago was ruled on by the Supreme Court, extending full fundamental rights protection to the Second Amendment, and making it applicable to all 50 states in the country. This case is no longer valid for review; especially since the Supreme Court hasn't taken it up.\n \n It was the same appeals court that ruled Chicago's handgun ban was constitutional and inline with the law and should be allowed to remain intact. The Supreme Court told them to go **** themselves.\n \n Also note that this case involved a matter of unregulated firearms in the Chicago area. At the time of this case, by law, handguns weren't allowed to be owned or registered in the city. So by law Mr. Justice couldn't be compelled to register the firearms with the city because A) the registration process wasn't allowed, so it was a physical impossibility and B) handgun possession and ownership was outlawed in the city of Chicago, so any attempt at registration would be an admittance that we was in violation of the law and made subject to criminal penalties no matter what he did. This case is no different than US v Haynes.\n \n \n \nI never said that I was against anyone owning a gun. The Point I was trying to make was that it doesn't really matter what We as Citizens think, if the Government wants gun registration they;ll get it ... read Article above...\n\n \n And your point is wrong. We the people of this nation make the ultimate determination of who will be a congressman for the next two years, and if we don't like what the previous holder had to say, or what they supported, then we remove them from office and replace them with somebody who says what we like. So we make the rules, we determine what laws will be put into play, and they know that full well. That's why those who care about reelection will listen to the disgruntled voters and withhold support for an unacceptable bill.\n \n \nCurrently there are over 20,000 Laws concerning Guns that are / or could be considered Unconstitutional. This doesn't change the fact that they are LAW and if we break the Law we will be arrested.\n\n \n And somewhere down the line the law in question will come up for constitutional review. And if found unconstitutional the law will be overturned and the arrest/conviction expunged from record.\n \n \nAccording to the Constitution a person can strap a firearm to his hip and walk the streets, yet we don't see that in every day life now do we?\n\n \n Yes we do. Open carry rallies? You obviously missed the stink about Tea Party members showing up at political rallies while armed. You didn't notice the open carry movement at Starbucks in California that made the legislature attempt to outlaw the movement because there were too many little chicken****s getting scared over it and calling the police too often to investigate lawful behavior?\n \n \nLaws are changed all the time, and the Government does things that go against our constitutional rights and the sad fact is they will continue to do so.\n\n \n And so to you that's grounds to do away with our Constitution; because the government keeps violating it so we might as well just make it easier for them?\n \n \nWhen/If they Decide to require people to register guns they will do so,Unconstitutional or not.\n\n \n Not so. The New Orleans police were confiscating firearms left and right in the aftermath of Katrina, and we filed and injunction in court to stop this practice from going any further. And after a long, drawn out court battle we finally forced the city to not only admit their guilt, but return the property to their rightful owners.",

But the first question is will the law restrict an activity that is protected by the right? If you think it will do so, then you have to be prepared to defend it under strict scrutiny.

However, applying the Fundamental Rights standard, are there gun laws anywhere in the U.S. that definitely should be removed from the books? \n \n 6. It has been said that, often in plea bargains, that the gun charges are frequently the charges that are dropped. Is that something that you have observed in our criminal justice system?\n \n Thanks Bryan. Thank you for your service.\n\n \n 1. I can't think of any off hand. Of course, if someone wants to suggest one then we can evaluate it....\n 2. I would have to see the law....\n 3. Not really. When you say help me I take that as helping catch and convict someone who has committed a crime. Until we reach a time of unlimited budgets and manpower, I believe we need to focus our resources on things that actually help solve all crimes and not just one gun control advocates have a hard on for. But, if someone wants to offer a gun law suggestion then we can have a look....\n 4. I can't think of any that I deal with.\n 5. I'm not real sure. I would have to see the law. \n 6. Absolutely. IMO there are a lot of cases handled this way. There are situations that call for them, but I do not like plea bargains-and I have never plead away a gun charge. In other jurisdictions gun crimes are plead away because they carry mandatory prison sentences. I realize that larger jurisdictions with overloaded dockets feel the need to bargain cases, but I have a problem with doing it that way. I didn't become a prosecutor to so I could become Monty Hall and offer someone a trade for what's behind door number 3. It has too much of a danger of favoritism, with the rich boy's attorney saying his client deserves a better deal because \"he's a good kid. He comes from a good family.\" I say charge what I believe the evidence says he did, and then go try and prove it.",

   "Yeah, that this is a big stretch in my opinion. The 5th amendment clearly speaks to being \"compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\". Are we going to say sex-offender registration is self-incrimination because if they are living within a few hundred feet of a school they would be turning themselves in? I don't think so. \n \n I'm not saying registration has a good purpose, I'm saying \"good purpose\" is not a constitutional requirement for anything.\n\n \n Yes, we would. That was the exact issue in Haynes that I cited earlier. \n AS you accurately cite, the Constitutional provision in question reads: \"No person...shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\"\n \n But this goes far beyond being compelled to take the stand at his trial and give testimony. The privilege against self incrimination is not a dormant right that only wakes up once you are charged with a crime and land in a courtroom. It exists as a 24/7 protection. We have all seen cop shows on TV where the actors give the arrested suspect his Miranda warnings including the right to remain silent. That is nothing more than reminding the suspect that he has a privilege against self-incrimination, and that if he wishes to use it then the government cannot force him to talk. But the warnings do not trigger the application of the right. The warnings are issued because of a Court created rule that requires the police to educate the suspect about what his rights are so he can make a voluntary choice of whether or not to exercise them. Most people waive these rights and talk because they think they can talk their way out of trouble. But the bottom line with interrogations is the government is compelling you to sit in a room with an officer who wants to talk with you, and before any questions can be asked the government is required to prove that the person waived the protection of the self incrimination privilege. Otherwise, the statement was \"compelled\" and cannot be used against him at a later trial. \n \n So say Mr. A is arrested for burglary and he claims his right to remain silent when questioned. This assertion of the right does not give him immunity from prosecution for the burglary-he can still be charged with that and go to trial if you have enough evidence without a confession. But what you cannot do is charge him with obstructing justice for refusing to talk-because that would be prosecuting him for refusing to give up a constitutional right. \n \n The same principle applies with equal force when the government \"compels\" an admission to a crime by a registration scheme. This is why SCOTUS said this in the Mackey case:\n \n Of course, the Government may not insulate inquiries designed to produce incriminating information merely by [Page 709] labeling the inquiry a necessary incident of a regulatory scheme. Where the essence of a statutory scheme is to forbid a given class of activities, it may not be enforced by requiring individuals to report their violations.\n \n Let's use your example of the sex offender who-unknown to the police-is violating a law that says he cannot live within a certain number of feet of a school. He is required to register where he lives, and failing to do so is a crime. But if he registers he is confessing that he is committing another crime of living too close to the school. For him there is a \"real and appreciable\" hazard that registering would cause him to be prosecuted for living too close to the school-and, more importantly, that his confession contained in the registration would be used against him to convict him. He has a right not to confess his crime, and you can no more punish him for refusing to confess through registration than you can make it a separate crime to not call the police and report that you have broken into a house and stolen something within 24 hours of doing so. He is not immune from being prosecuted for living too close to the school, but he is immune from prosecution for failing to confess that he is doing so-and because registration would be a confession to this crime, he cannot be prosecuted for failing to register. Prosecuting him for failing to register would be nothing more than punishing him only because he refused to waive a constitutional right. \n \n I'm also not saying that registration has a good purpose. It is up to those who support registration to tell us the laudable goal(s) of the law-or admit they just want it for no other reason than to harass gun owners and spy on their activities....Typically crime control is the justification. I'm just waiting for someone to explain how it will help.... \n \n In the meantime, let me leave everyone with this solid view of the privilege against self incrimination:\n \n This command of the Fifth Amendment (\"nor shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\") registers an important advance in the development of our liberty - \"one of the great landmarks in man's struggle to make himself civilized.\"1 Time has not shown that protection from the evils against which this safeguard was directed is needless or unwarranted. This constitutional protection must not be interpreted in a hostile or niggardly spirit. Too many, even those who should be better advised, view this privilege as a shelter for wrongdoers. They too readily assume that those who invoke it are either guilty of crime or commit perjury in claiming the privilege.2 Such a view does scant honor [Page 427] to the patriots who sponsored the Bill of Rights as a condition to acceptance of the Constitution by the ratifying States. The Founders of the Nation were not naive or disregardful of the interests of justice. The difference between them and those who deem the privilege an obstruction to due inquiry has been appropriately indicated by Chief Judge Magruder:\n \n \"Our forefathers, when they wrote this provision into the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, had in mind a lot of history which has been largely forgotten to-day. See VIII Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed. 1940) \u00a7 2250 et seq.; Morgan, The Privilege Against Self-Incrimination, 34 Minn. L. Rev. 1 (1949). They made a judgment and expressed it in our fundamental law, that it were better for an occasional crime to go unpunished than that the prosecution should be free to build up a criminal case, in whole or in part, with the assistance of enforced disclosures by the accused. The privilege against self-incrimination serves as a protection to the innocent as well as to the guilty, and we have been admonished that it should be given a liberal application. Hoffman v. United States, . . . 341 U.S. 479, 486. . . . If it be thought that the privilege is outmoded in the conditions of this modern [Page 428] age, then the thing to do is to take it out of the Constitution, not to whittle it down by the subtle encroachments of judicial opinion.\" Maffie v. United States, 209 F.2d 225, 227. \n Ullmann v. United States, 350 U.S. 422, 426-428 (1956)\n \n Now, if we could only get people to view the RKBA the same way....",

To even assume such a statement one would have to give up his rights, not only RKBA (2A) but also to bow down to illicit powers of an out of control oligarchy or dictator. Wasn't it Abagail Abbey that said, \"when people are disarmed, only the outlaws and government will have guns; I intend to become one of the outlaws\". I have asked the anti Constitutionalists many times to show an enumerated power that would allow such a situation to occur...any branch of government whether it be the executive, legislative or the Court. I will ask you the same; show me the power that would \"make it legal to compell registration of firearms\" even by criminals. You should know of all people that gun control is not crime control and in no way aids law enforcement nor the court and would be a complete criminal measure to try to impose on the law abiding a criminal law such as that. Gov't is not nor has never been to keep the people without error, the peoples' job is to keep the government from falling into error.\n \n In the poll this morning, from yesterday over a two or three day period, more people disapprove of the executive by about 55%, The congress by more than 66% and the direction of this country by over 75%.\n \n \nSo why exactly do you feel that there's a definite need for a roster of people who aren't going around and breaking the law? For what need do you feel it's necessary to monitor the law-abiding like they're criminals and dangerous to the general public?\n\n \n The same reason King George did. He encouraged the importation of slaves by the Dutch, Spain and other allies and parts of the old Roman Empire and proposed to make America and everyone in it a slave. The folks who ignore this fact and encourage violations of inalienable rights want power over those with the teeth of freedom simply because they have evil intentions and want to oppose natural law that comes from G-D. Most are atheist, agnostic or deists who resent any moral authority and want to impose their own beliefs on the foundations of this Republic formed on the 10 Commandments and a strong belief in the supreme Deity. They are driven and compelled much like our current foreign and domestic enemies to violate the principles this Republic as founded on. Besides that, they are lazy ___________ that want socialism, communism and facism instead of a free Republic. They don't belong here but continue to assert CHANGE to what they perceive as an easier way, the same that caused the downfall of the Roman Empire.\n \n You put too much emphasis on their propaganda speil that they mean well and apparently have accepted it as truth when it is anything but the truth.\n \n Very simply, they fear what would happen to them if they made a stronger push to change our Republic and rightly observe there is no way to control free, ARMED CITIZENS.\n \n I am a bit put out with TITHER also for asking if any gun law would help a prosecutor after all the data he has posted that shows no gun control law has ever been effective as crime control. At least we have one honest prosecutor who apparently hasn't forgotten his oath. The majority; however, will lie, cheat and suborn or accept perjury to gain a conviction, sometimes of honest men who are completely innocent. If they had their duty before them they would be concentrating on government illuminaries, our own government for crimes against the Constitution and abuse of power. They all know the law but turn their heads and hearts to their own desires and choose to ignore the laws and morals that founded this Republic and bears true faith and alligience to it. (and that is all I have to say about that for now...)\n \n In reality, those who want to change the Constitution and pervert rights should be actively sought out and prosecuted for advocating \"gun control\" which is really an assault on every ones' rights and the highest form of attempted conspiracy and theft there is. Those are the most dangerous criminals of all and aiding and abetting them by even considering their agenda is capitulation and corruption right up there with high crimes and misdomeanors. Those who are intent on carrying on with this agenda and keep repeating it as if constant assent will delude people and make it come true is no more than a current Benedict Arnold.

   "  IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776 -- The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America \n\n \n Many Christian's who think of America as founded upon Christianity usually present the Declaration of Independence as \"proof\" of a Christian America. The reason appears obvious: the Declaration mentions God. (You may notice that some Christians avoid the Constitution, with its absence of God.)\n However, the Declaration of Independence does not represent any law of the United States. It came before the establishment of our lawful government (the Constitution). The Declaration aimed at announcing the separation of America from Great Britain and it listed the various grievances with them. The Declaration includes the words, \"The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America.\" The grievances against Great Britain no longer hold today, and we have more than thirteen states.\n Although the Declaration may have influential power, it may inspire the lofty thoughts of poets and believers, and judges may mention it in their summations, it holds no legal power today. It represents a historical document about rebellious intentions against Great Britain at a time before the formation of our government.\n Of course the Declaration stands as a great political document. Its author aimed at a future government designed and upheld by people and not based on a superstitious god or religious monarchy. It observed that all men \"are created equal\" meaning that we all have the natural ability of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That \"to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men.\" Please note that the Declaration says nothing about our rights secured by Christianity. It bears repeating: \"Governments are instituted among men.\"\n The pursuit of happiness does not mean a guarantee of happiness, only that we have the freedom to pursue it. Our Law of the Land incorporates this freedom of pursuit in the Constitution. We can believe or not believe as we wish. We may succeed or fail in our pursuit, but our Constitution (and not the Declaration) protects our unalienable rights in our attempt at happiness.\n Moreover, the mentioning of God in the Declaration does not describe the personal God of Christianity. Thomas Jefferson who held deist beliefs, wrote the majority of the Declaration. The Declaration describes \"the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God.\" This nature's view of God agrees with deist philosophy and might even appeal to those of pantheistic beliefs, but any attempt to use the Declaration as a support for Christianity will fail for this reason alone.\n \n http://www.nobeliefs.com/Tripoli.htm\n \n Nice try though",

   "You should check YOUR sources. Jefferson as well as most of the other Founders were not Christians, they were Deists . The Country was founded on the Premise of religious Freedom, Not as a Christian Nation. Doesn't matter how hard you try or how much you wish it were true you can't change what is history.\n\n \n You slipped a cog by not even acknowledging the Pilgrims. Morals come from exactly where X? Laws have to be based on something including the Hammarabi Code. For starters, list me one other 'religion' involved in this nation's founding documents including the Fed and Anti-Fed papers. Your sticking point is that TJ was a deist when he wrote the Declaration of Independence is laughable and ridiculous. Many people who want to change our rights and Constitution make the same arguements for the same reasons you do...they hate the idea that man didn't \"give any rights, they come from G-D\" and are inalienable but you can't stand that so you want to dismiss the truth and claim our Republic's Constitution can be rewritten...by evil men. Here is some more on Jefferson and some quotes:\n \n \nHow did Jefferson know?\n Thomas Jefferson was a very remarkable man who started learning very early in life and never stopped.\n \u00b7 At 5, began studying under his cousins' tutor.\n \u00b7 At 9, studied Latin, Greek and French.\n \u00b7 At 14, studied classical literature and additional languages.\n \u00b7 At 16, entered the College of William and Mary.\n \u00b7 At 19, studied Law for 5 years starting under George Wythe.\n \u00b7 At 23, started his own law practice.\n \u00b7 At 25, was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses.\n \u00b7 At 31, wrote the widely circulated \"Summary View of the Rights of British America\" and retired from his law practice.\n \u00b7 At 32, was a Delegate to the Second Continental Congress.\n \u00b7 At 33, wrote the Declaration of Independence.\u00b7 At 33, took three years to revise Virginia 's legal code and wrote a Public Education bill and a statute for Religious Freedom.\u00b7 \n \n .At 36, was elected the second Governor of Virginia succeeding Patrick Henry.\n \u00b7 At 40, served in Congress for two years.\n \u00b7 At 41, was the American minister to France and negotiated commercial treaties with European nations along with Ben Franklin and John Adams.\n \u00b7 At 46, served as the first Secretary of State under George Washington.\n \u00b7 At 53, served as Vice President and was elected president of the American Philosophical Society.\n \u00b7 At 55, drafted the Kentucky Resolutions and became the active head of Republican Party.\n \u00b7 At 57, was elected the third president of the United States .\n \u00b7 At 60, obtained the Louisiana Purchase doubling the nation's size.\n \u00b7 At 61, was elected to a second term as President.\n \u00b7 At 65, retired to Monticello .\n \u00b7 At 80, helped President Monroe shape the Monroe Doctrine.\n \u00b7 At 81, almost single-handedly created the University of Virginia and served as its first president.\n \u00b7 At 83, died on the 50th anniversary of the Signing of the Declaration of Independence along with John Adams.\n Thomas Jefferson knew what he was talking about because he-himself studied the previous failed attempts at government.\n He understood actual history, the nature of God, his laws and the nature of man.\n That happens to be way more than what most understand today. Jefferson really knew his stuff.\n \n A voice from the past to lead us in the future:\n John F. Kennedy held a dinner in the white House for a group of the brightest minds in the nation at that time. He made this statement: \"This is perhaps the assembly of the most intelligence ever to gather at one time in the White House with the exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.\"\n \n \n \n \n When we get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, we shall become as corrupt as Europe.\n Thomas Jefferson \n \n The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not. \n Thomas Jefferson \n \n It is incumbent on every generation to pay its own debts as it goes. \n A principle which if acted on would save one-half the wars of the world.\n Thomas Jefferson\n \n \n I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them. \n Thomas Jefferson \n My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government. \n Thomas Jefferson \n \n No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms. \n Thomas Jefferson \n The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government. \n Thomas Jefferson \n \n The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. \n Thomas Jefferson \n \n To compel a man to subsidize with his taxes the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical. \n Thomas Jefferson \n Thomas Jefferson said in 1802:\n \"I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies..\n If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property - until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.\"\n \n",

You believe that you should be able to SAY and REPORT ANYTHING you want! Does THIS sound REASONABLE and RATIONAL to YOUR mind? The First Amendment was written ages ago; surely you do not think that it applies to our modern society today! Back when it was written there were no Internet, computers, radio, no television, no cameras, and no microphones. Now we can even get news and the Internet over our cell phones. There was no instant reporting back when the Constitution was written! It took days, weeks, and even months before people could get the news. Back then, they had to set type by hand. \n \n Lets start by having a three-day cooling off period, before anything can be written. Come on let's be reasonable. Lets just have a few common sense controls on the First Amendment. No one is trying to take away your First Amendment Freedoms, but Children are being kidnapped, and killed because of the Internet. We need to protect our children. You know, that dragging death and other hate crimes could have been prevented, if we did not have so many hate sites on the Internet. Lets have Christians United look at everything before it can be printed. \n \n Also we should start licensing and registration of computers and grant Internet Access Rights. What are you afraid of? \n \n You know, That Radical Group The National Association of Broadcasters is totally unwilling to help us by even proposing common sense censorship limits. Who are you trying to protect? You and that Radical Group, The National Association of Broadcasters, are just trying to protect your pedophile buddies, aren&#8217;t you? \n \n Something has to be done! \n \n We have computer games, newspapers, television, movies and Rap music that is killing our society with these poisoned images. Come on lets be reasonable! You know, nothing is written in stone. It is just a piece of paper penned by those OLD Dead White Guys, and it is an archaic document. It is too old and antiquated for our modern society. \n \n I know that you People think you have an Inalienable First Amendment Right. Well we say Bull! Repeal the First Amendment!\n \n And JUST WAIT till I get to the 4th and 5th Amendments, the supposed Right to a trial by jury, the Supposed Right for women to vote and all! \n \n UHhh! UHhh!",

   "If you believe in God and your job is to build chairs do you build a chair with references to God on it? Do you require that it used only for the church or only sold in the church? The answer is of course no. So why would we think people setting up a government would have it be run by the church? Their job was a government and they saw the dangers of having a government run a church. It perverts the religion. So the government was set up in the best way they could figure out how to run a government. Where the atheists are wrong is thinking that God had nothing to do with it. Most of the founders did believe in a God and where guided by those beliefs. This is not to say they wrote in religious tenants but that their \"life lessons\" (for lack of a better term) were crafted from religious beliefs. This is akin to someone learning the value of hard work while working at a fast food place and then applying that value when they work professionally as a furniture maker. You aren't taking the actual concepts of burger flipping to the furniture maker job, just your work philosophy. \n \n Anyway, religion, and specifically Christianity, were a big part of the founding of our country. You don't have to agree with how they thought but to deny this is just turning a blind eye towards history.",

   "No offense at taking things off subject Xcaliber. It happens all the time and I am as guilty of it as the next person. \n \n I hear the complaint about Christians trying to \"force\" their beliefs on people all the time-and I know it's happened. Let me say this. I am a Christian, but I have read all four Gospels, and in all four of them I can find only once instance of Christ resorting to the use of force-and that was to drive the sinners from the temple, not to make them attend. Christianity is a gift that is freely given and must be freely received. I'm not here to force my religion on anybody. It is none of my business to know what you think or feel about religion unless you choose to open your thoughts to me. The Commandment is to \"Love thy neighbor\" not \"Spy on thy neighbor to find out what he is up to.\" I have no desire to start my own inquisition.\n \n Having said that, though, let me ask you about some things you have said on topic that I strongly disagree with:\n \n \nIf a person has a problem with registering their weapons then maybe we should ask what they are hiding. \n\n \n You are not suggesting that we start an inquisition of gun owners, are you? How is this any different than me saying: \"America is a Christian Nation and if anybody has a problem with it then maybe we should ask what they are hiding\"? Whether it's a gun or a bible, isn't what I choose to keep or not keep in my nightstand a private matter? The question should not be what am I hiding but what gives you the right to believe that I am hiding anything, and what gives you the right to suggest you are entitled to an answer.... \n \n \nI say again what is So Private about owning a gun. \n\n \n I say again why do you feel you have the right to know what I have?\n \n I know you have argued, in essence, \"what's the big deal\" with registration since we have in your opinion already surrendered so much of our privacy. First, don't assume that I have acquiesced in any encroachment of any right I have. Second, you will forgive me if I refuse to accept a policy that calls upon me to strike the colors so soon. When it comes to the battle for recognition of my rights, I am not ready to leave the government in possession of the field. \n \n \nPeople living in the past and clinging to a 200 some odd year old Constitution that the Government tramples on whenever they see fit....\n \n I've stated in the past that I DO NOT support any Law requiring the registration of weapons I was merely giving my own opinion as to whether we can do anything about it and pointing out that clinging to a constitution that was written in a completely different time is pointless. \n\n \n It's interesting how very much these comments sound like Obama's \"they cling to guns or religion\" comment. Oh I know my Constitution and its Bill of Rights has got some age on it. But let me quote a little Patrick Henry: \"I am fearful I have lived long enough to become an old fashioned fellow: Perhaps an invincible attachment to the dearest rights of man, may, in these refined enlightened days, be deemed old fashioned: If so, I am contented to be so. . . .\" So yes, I still cling to it-all of it. Call me what you like, but if my rights are still within my reach, then I will endeavor to keep a good grip on them. \n \n I know you say you do not support registration, but you also said this:\n \n \nI go buy a gun, a year later I sell it to someone through a newspaper ad, five years later that person sells it to an unknown person at a yard sale, a week after that that gun is used to commit a murder and found in a trash can... they trace the serial number back to me.. \" Well I sold that gun 6 years ago, don't remember the guys name .. Oh wait.. If That guy would have been required to register that gun maybe we could find him.... ... \n\n \n So you do not support registration, but you think it hurts no one to have it, and having it would help solve crimes? Please explain.... \n \n And in reply to someone else's comment about cars, etc. not being fundamental rights:\n \n \nNeither is owning a gun. \n\n \n I disagree. But more importantly, SCOTUS disagrees with you. \n \n \nSure we are given the right to bare arms. \n\n \n I'm confused. If it is not a \"fundamental\" right, then what kind of right is it in your opinion?

   "No offense at taking things off subject Xcaliber. It happens all the time and I am as guilty of it as the next person. \n \n I hear the complaint about Christians trying to \"force\" their beliefs on people all the time-and I know it's happened. Let me say this. I am a Christian, but I have read all four Gospels, and in all four of them I can find only once instance of Christ resorting to the use of force-and that was to drive the sinners from the temple, not to make them attend. Christianity is a gift that is freely given and must be freely received. I'm not here to force my religion on anybody. It is none of my business to know what you think or feel about religion unless you choose to open your thoughts to me. The Commandment is to \"Love thy neighbor\" not \"Spy on thy neighbor to find out what he is up to.\" I have no desire to start my own inquisition.\n\n \n Well I'm not ashamed to tell people that I am an Atheist and do not conform to any religion. But that is for a different forum so I'll try to keep this on the subject at hand.\n \n \n \n Having said that, though, let me ask you about some things you have said on topic that I strongly disagree with:\n \n \n \n\n You are not suggesting that we start an inquisition of gun owners, are you? How is this any different than me saying: \"America is a Christian Nation and if anybody has a problem with it then maybe we should ask what they are hiding\"? Whether it's a gun or a bible, isn't what I choose to keep or not keep in my nightstand a private matter? The question should not be what am I hiding but what gives you the right to believe that I am hiding anything, and what gives you the right to suggest you are entitled to an answer.... \n\n \n No, Never. Look, Some of the things I have said have been taken out of Context. For the record I Support the right to own weapons. I do not support any Law requiring registration of said weapons. The intent of my posting was to bring to light the fact that In my own opinion I don't think there is much that we as Citizens can do. Although I do not support such a Law if our Government were to Pass one requiring registration I would reluctantly do so because It would be Law.\n \n \n\n I say again why do you feel you have the right to know what I have?\n\n \n Again taken wrong, I never meant that I had any right to invade yours or anyone else s' Privacy, I personally don't care what anyone else owns or does in the Privacy of their homes.\n \n \n \n\n I know you have argued, in essence, \"what's the big deal\" with registration since we have in your opinion already surrendered so much of our privacy. First, don't assume that I have acquiesced in any encroachment of any right I have. Second, you will forgive me if I refuse to accept a policy that calls upon me to strike the colors so soon. When it comes to the battle for recognition of my rights, I am not ready to leave the government in possession of the field. \n \n \n Ok..\n \n \n\n It's interesting how very much these comments sound like Obama's \"they cling to guns or religion\" comment. Oh I know my Constitution and its Bill of Rights has got some age on it. But let me quote a little Patrick Henry: \"I am fearful I have lived long enough to become an old fashioned fellow: Perhaps an invincible attachment to the dearest rights of man, may, in these refined enlightened days, be deemed old fashioned: If so, I am contented to be so. . . .\" So yes, I still cling to it-all of it. Call me what you like, but if my rights are still within my reach, then I will endeavor to keep a good grip on them.\n\n \n As you should, \n \n \n\n So you do not support registration, but you think it hurts no one to have it, and having it would help solve crimes? Please explain....\n \n \n I don't support registration but I am open minded enough to realize that maybe, just maybe there is a need for it along the line. If in some way the Law finds a way to require registration but at the same time protect our rights as individuals I could be inclined to change my view..\n \n \n \n\n And in reply to someone else's comment about cars, etc. not being fundamental rights:\n \n \n If owning a Gun is considered a Fundamental Right then Owning a Car should be the same. The Government passes Laws to require you to register your car, and no one threw up their arms and cried about their rights being stripped .\n \n \n\n I disagree. But more importantly, SCOTUS disagrees with you.\n \n \n that's your right... \n \n \n\n I'm confused. If it is not a \"fundamental\" right, then what kind of right is it in your opinion? Or is it a right to bear them but not to own them?\n \n \n I guess this one depends on what your definition of a \"Fundamental\" Right would be. In the Constitution the only \" Fundamental \" rights are the right to Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. All other rights are awarded BY the constitution, by men who Founded our way of Life. The Right to own a Weapon is in no way or never has been a so called \" God Given \" Right. \n According to our Country's Constitution we are awarded the rights to keep and bare arms. I would suppose owning them would fall under that too. \n \n \n\n Look, I don't mind you creating your own illogical opposing arguments just so you can then tear them down-I just want to make it plain that at these times you are arguing with yourself and that at no time are you my spokesman. If you wish to take issue with anything I have actually said then feel free....\n \n \n Never claimed to be anyone's spokesman. And to you my arguments may seem illogical but to me they are not. I can't help if you or others don't understand my meaning.\n \n \n \n\n Molon Labe.\n \n \n Let's just hope they don't have to try.\n \n ---\n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent.

All other rights are awarded BY the constitution, by men who Founded our way of Life. The Right to own a Weapon is in no way or never has been a so called \" God Given \" Right. \n \n According to our Country's Constitution we are awarded the rights to keep and bare arms. I would suppose owning them would fall under that too. \n \n   FEDERALIST No. 28 HAMILTON \n If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that \n  original right of self-defense \n which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. \n In a single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense. \n The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair. \n The usurpers, clothed with the forms of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo.\n \n The obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase with the increased extent of the state, provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them. \n",

Nevertheless...\n \n Assuming Haynes WAS correct, I'm not sure how that presents a problem for registration. Clearly the ruling didn't ban registration and you wouldn't ban any law that requires you do something or face a penalty. There are too many numerous examples of the government doing this.

   "Hayes is not the only case to interpret the 5th. Amendment this way. SCOTUS has been very clear and very consistent with this interpretation. Here is another example involving gambling. Congress had passed a statute requiring all persons engaged in the business of gambling to register their business and pay an occupational tax on the amount of wagers they dealt with. The defendant in this case was operating an illegal gambling operation, and he obviously had not registered his illegal operation. In addition to being charged with illegal gambling, he was prosecuted for failing to register his illegal activities. SCOTUS reversed his conviction:\n \n In these circumstances, it can scarcely be denied that the obligations to register and to pay the occupational tax created for petitioner \"real and appreciable,\" and not merely \"imaginary and unsubstantial,\" hazards of self-incrimination. Reg. v. Boyes, 1 B. & S. 311, 330; Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 599-600; Rogers v. United States, 340 U.S. 367, 374. Petitioner was confronted by a comprehensive system of federal and state prohibitions against wagering activities; he was required, on pain of criminal prosecution, to provide information which he might reasonably suppose would be available to prosecuting authorities, and which would surely prove a significant \"link in a chain\"9 of evidence tending to establish his guilt.10 Unlike the income tax return [Page 49] in question in United States v. Sullivan, 274 U.S. 259, every portion of these requirements had the direct and unmistakable consequence of incriminating petitioner; the application of the constitutional privilege to the entire registration procedure was in this instance neither \"extreme\" nor \"extravagant.\" See id., at 263. It would appear to follow that petitioner's assertion of the privilege as a defense to this prosecution was entirely proper, and accordingly should have sufficed to prevent his conviction.\n Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 48-49 (1968)\n \n \n Let me first address your example of drug testing. The 5th. Amendment protects you only from testimonial incriminations-voice samples, drug testing samples, bodily fluids for DNA comparisons, fingerprint samples, handwriting samples-these are all examples of things outside the protection of the privilege against self-incrimination. \n \n But beyond this the issue is not creating a registration scheme by itself. So long as Congress has the enumerated power to do so and the registration would not otherwise unconstitutionally infringe upon an individual right then registration is OK. The issue is not even enforcing the scheme by punishing those who refuse to register. So long as the registration scheme is constitutional then the punishments will be too. The 5th. Amendment problem arises when the registration compels you to also confess to a separate crime-like felons in possession. Here is where the 5th. Amendment draws the line-for no statutory registration scheme can surpass a constitutional mandate. It does not invalidate the entire registration scheme, however. If a person's risk of self-incrimination is real and appreciable, then the registration scheme is unconstitutional as applied to him-as far as punishing any failure to register goes-for in these circumstances the crime of failing to register is based upon a failure to waive a fundamental right. And so I-a non-felon who would not be confessing to a crime by registering-would have no choice but to register or risk the punishments for failing to register. The felon next door is free not to register because the government cannot force him to confess to a crime. \n \n There are a number of laws that require registration which take into account the 5th. Amendment problem. Virginia's sex offender registry is one of them, for example. It can be done a number of ways. The easiest way is to give the person use and derivative use immunity for the registration information he supplies (the sex offender registry does not do it this way, by the way). If you give immunity then you easily solve the 5th. Amendment problem. But, you may have heard of cases where a lawyer introduces damaging information that is not admissible, and the judge tells the jury to ignore what was just presented-with the phrase being said \"that's like the lawyer throwing a skunk into the jury box and the judge telling the jury to ignore the smell.\" The same train of thought exists with registration. A felon is not going to throw a skunk into the police station by registering his firearm and trust that the police are going to ignore the smell. The law may say they must ignore the registration, but his fear will be that as soon as he registers he will become a target of officers who know he has a gun but are prohibited from proving it until they actually catch him with it. What do you think the registration compliance rate will be for people who have this fear?",

   "I guess this one depends on what your definition of a \"Fundamental\" Right would be. In the Constitution the only \" Fundamental \" rights are the right to Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.

The Right to own a Weapon is in no way or never has been a so called \" God Given \" Right. \n According to our Country's Constitution we are awarded the rights to keep and bare arms. I would suppose owning them would fall under that too \n\n \n I disagree. The term \"Fundamental Right\" is a creation of SCOTUS, which has applied the term to nearly every specific right recognized in the Bill of Rights. As SCOTUS uses the term it is not limited to the three rights you mention. But a better reason for why SCOTUS does not tie the term down to these three rights is they are not all found in the Constitution. The three \"Fundamental\" rights you mention are actually found in the most famous phrase of the Declaration of Independence: \n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\n \n Within the Constitution itself the terms \"Life\" and \"Liberty\" are mentioned in the 5th. Amendment-in the context of you have a right not to be deprived of these things arbitrarily:\n \n nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. \n \n And the language repeats itself in the 14th Amendment's command: \"nor shall any state deprive\" these rights without due process.\n \n The word \"Happiness\" and the pursuit thereof is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution. \n \n Additionally, in both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution the listing of rights is expressly deemed to be non-exhaustive. In the Declaration, when Jefferson says \"that among these are\" he is clearly stating that the three he lists are only examples of a larger body of rights.\n \n The same principle was used in the Bill of Rights, as expressed by the 9th. Amendment:\n \n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\n \n Finally, the Bill of Rights did not create any rights, it only recognized rights which our founders believed we already possessed:\n \n \"The law is perfectly well settled that the first ten Amendments to the Constitution, commonly known as the Bill of Rights, were not intended to lay down any novel principles of government, but simply to embody certain guarantees and immunities which we had inherited from our English ancestors. . . .\" Robertson v. Baldwin 165 U.S. 275, 281-82 (1897).\n \n Now in saying this I am not at all claiming that the RKBA is a \"God given right.\" It is most certainly, however, not a right that was created in 1789. The RKBA can be traced back over 2000 years, our founders laid a specific claim to the exercise of the right before the Declaration of Independence (and Jefferson was again the prime author of that claim), and its inclusion into the Bill of Rights is proof of the importance our founders placed upon the right.",

There are dozens of examples like this and to say they are unconstitutional due to the 5th amendment is, in my opinion, a perversion of the amendment.\n\n \n No. I am not saying that any of these things that are similar to drug testing are unconstitutional. For the record, I know of several things the Government can compel without running afoul of the 5th. Amendment. Some examples are: 1. Forcing you to reenact a crime, 2. To shave facial hair, 3. To try on clothing (like they foolishly tried with O.J.), 4. To dye your hair, 5. Do provide samples of your speech, 5. To appear in a line-up of otherwise have your physical characteristics recorded, and 6. To provide physical samples like hair, blood, breath, urine, fingerprints, and handwriting.\n \n The 5th. Amendment question is not resolved only by asking whether 1. the act is compelled and 2. The result might be incriminatory. As I argued earlier and will state again, the 5th. Amendment only protects against compelled communications:\n \n The privilege reaches only compulsion of \"an accused's communications, whatever form they might take, and the compulsion of responses which are also communications. Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 266 (1967)\n \n This is why the above mentioned items do not qualify. True, they are acts compelled by the threat of punishment, and they are intended to discover incriminating information. But a drug test for example does not require you to acknowledge anything. It does not require you to admit to anything-and that is the essence of the privilege:\n \n The Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment reads: \"No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\" This Court has explained that \"the privilege protects a person only against being incriminated by his own compelled testimonial communications.\" Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S., at 409, citing Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966); United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967); and Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263 (1967)....\n \n An examination of the Court's application of these [Page 210] principles in other cases indicates the Court's recognition that, in order to be testimonial, an accused's communication must itself, explicitly or implicitly, relate a factual assertion or disclose information.9 Only then is a person compelled to be a \"witness\" against himself.\n \n This understanding is perhaps most clearly revealed in those cases in which the Court has held that certain acts, though incriminating, are not within the privilege. Thus, a suspect may be compelled to furnish a blood sample, Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S., at 765; to provide a handwriting exemplar, Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S., at 266-267, or a voice exemplar, United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1, 7 (1973); to stand in a lineup, United States v. Wade, 388 U.S., at 221-222; and to wear particular clothing, Holt v. United States, 218 U.S. 245, 252-253 (1910). These decisions are grounded on the proposition that \"the privilege protects an accused only from being compelled to testify against himself, or otherwise provide the State with evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature.\" Schmerber, 384 U.S., at 761. The Court accordingly held that the privilege [Page 211] was not implicated in each of those cases, because the suspect was not required \"to disclose any knowledge he might have,\" or \"to speak his guilt,\" Wade, 388 U.S., at 222-223. See Dionisio, 410 U.S., at 7; Gilbert, 388 U.S., at 266-267. It is the \"extortion of information from the accused,\" Couch v. United States, 409 U.S., at 328, the attempt to force him \"to disclose the contents of his own mind,\" Curcio v. United States, 354 U.S. 118, 128 (1957), that implicates the Self-Incrimination Clause. See also Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 445 (1972) (the privilege \"protects against any disclosures that the witness reasonably believes could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used\") (emphasis added). \"Unless some attempt is made to secure a communication - written, oral or otherwise - upon which reliance is to be placed as involving [the accused's] consciousness of the facts and the operations of his mind in expressing it, the demand made upon him is not a testimonial one.\" 8 Wigmore \u00a7 2265, p. 386.10 [Page 212]. Doe v. United States, 487 U.S. 201, 209-212 (1988) (bold emphasis added by me)\n \n This is why drug testing, DNA samples, etc. can be compelled. Again, these acts-although used to discover incriminating information-do not require a person to admit his knowledge of that incriminating information. Thus, for example, a person stopped for DUI can be compelled to provide a breath or blood sample for testing, because he admits nothing by doing so. However, if you attempt to force him to answer the question \"how many beers have you had\" then you are forcing him to make a statement admitting a fact that incriminates him. \n \n Now a firearm registration scheme could be a testimonial communication if it requires you to admit that you have a firearm. If you have to register your own guns, then the act of registering compels you to \"disclose the contents of your mind\" about possessing a firearm (\"Yeah, I've got one and its stored here and the serial number is X\"). If this disclosure presents a \"real and appreciable\" risk that your written confession of the fact that you possess a firearm will be used against you to prosecute you for having the gun in violation of some other law then the 5th. Amendment justifies your refusal to register. For this reason if I have a gun and a felon has a gun, and registration is enacted requiring both of us to register any guns we have, then I must comply or face punishment, but the felon can refuse to register and if caught later he can assert his 5th. Amendment privilege as a complete bar to prosecution for failing to register. \n \n Now I know ways to get around this problem. In Freed that I cited earlier SCOTUS said the amendments to the NFA after the Hayes decision cured the problem. But since I do not think registration is a good idea I am not inclined to offer any advice to those who want to draft around these problems.",

Rangel is censored now lately and probably will become a felon like most gun grabber anti constitutionalists. I recall it and also criminal Rostentowski who was a liberal Speaker of the House until he was convicted of felonies. No gun law that has been passed is Constitutional and this is just one example. I protested at the time to no avail and brought it up many times in the mid to late 1990's. It is time for some fire and brimstone!",

   "This is EXACTLY why you Constitutional Rights Pimps can't be trusted! \n \n   The real story in D.C.'s gun data \n Here is the relevant point: The District still has no gun retailers, and a de facto ban on firearms endures. When a Post reporter tested the registration process, he found that it cost $834 &#8212; dwarfing the cost of most weapons. Moreover, registration required 16 hours, four trips to the police department, two background checks, fingerprints, photos, a vision test, a five-hour class and a 20-question examination. No wonder only 1,400 firearms have been registered since June 2008 in a city of 600,000 people. \n \n The city is violating the spirit, if not the letter, of the Heller decision. More litigation is sure to follow. \n\n $834!!!!! And how often does one have to repeat buying our Constitutional Right? Every 5 years? And for every gun? What? \n \n Registration makes the Government Constitutional Rights Pimps! The government is now complicit in denying the Poor and impeding them from obtaining Civil Rights!\n \n Unthinkable governmental, anti-Constitutional, Anti-gun arrogance at it's finest!\n \n This may not be an exact fit, but the Criminal principle is still there. Color of law\n \n   Color of Law \n U.S. law enforcement officers and other officials like judges, prosecutors, and security guards have been given tremendous power by local, state, and federal government agencies&#8212;authority they must have to enforce the law and ensure justice in our country. These powers include the authority to detain and arrest suspects, to search and seize property, to bring criminal charges, to make rulings in court, and to use deadly force in certain situations. \n \n Preventing abuse of this authority, however, is equally necessary to the health of our nation&#8217;s democracy.That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a federal crime for anyone acting under &#8220;color of law&#8221; willfully to deprive or conspire to deprive a person of a right protected by the Constitution or U.S. law.  &#8220;Color of law&#8221; simply means that the person is using authority given to him or her by a local, state, or federal government agency. \n\n You simply cannot be trusted with our Sacred Freedoms!",

The NRA is a respectable organization and they protect our rights as individuals to own and carry a gun if we so choose. I Promise you if I'm attacked by a Mugger in a dark alley I would much rather have my 9mm than a Bible any day...\n\n Whoa,X-Wing were gonna have some fun with this guy and I whole heartly agree about the 9mm and Bible.emoticon_xagree",

   "I have encountered many people during my stay here George Vreeland, always somebody new to interact with. You're the latest person to come here and offer up soundbyte statements as if they're relevant to the discussion going on without actually backing up whatever position you're arguing with facts that can be reviewed and analyzed and debated.\n \n And now onto the main message. This should be a fun one to dissect.\n \n \nGet guns out of society.\n\n \n The first part of the statement. And perhaps to most lacking in intelligence. Instead of looking for ways to remove guns from society shouldn't we instead be looking for ways to remove those that intentionally and deliberately misuse them in blatantly illegal and harmful ways? Why should we be focusing on the guns rather than the gang members and released felons that have proven they're incapable of functioning in society in an acceptable manner?\n \n And if we should work at removing guns from society why should we stop there? Are you aware of how many potentially deadly implements we use every single day without a second thought? How many items are available at any hardware store or Wal-Mart that can be readily adapted into a weapon that's purpose built for maiming and ending life?\n \n \nThe NRA needs to shut up with their right to bear arms bs.\n\n \n BS you say? You cast doubt on the validity of the message of the National Rifle Association?\n \n Perhaps you can explain why the NRA's position on the second amendment is supposedly \"BS\" while something like the ACLU's position regarding the fourth amendment is somehow not BS? What exactly makes one constitutionally recognized and protected right anymore valid than another?\n \n \nToo many people have lost their lives because of guns and each and every one of them had more of a right to live than you have to own a gun.\n\n \n I'm afraid this is so very wrong on so many levels.\n \n To start with nobody has ever lost their life \"because of guns\" but rather because they were murdered by another. And this act of murder is not dependent on the existence of the gun in question to be made physically possible. \n \n A person is capable of being murdered through an unlimited number of acts regardless of what the implement in question is. Air bubble embolism, carbon monoxide poisoning, toxic induced sepsis, bludgeoning, stabbing, poisoning, choking, hanging, vehicular homicide, drowning, countless forms of bacteria, medication mix ups, exsanguination, slipping and falling, undiagnosed concussion, genetic disorders, food allergies, medical malpractice, industrial accidents, falling down the stairs, being set on fire, etc.\n \n I'll ask the question again just in case it was missed the first time. Why should we focus on the tool rather than the person who will go out of their way to misuse the tool? You don't blame the shovel when a person is buried alive in a shallow grave, you blame the person who dumped the body there.\n \n Also is your claim that the people who were murdered had a right to live. While this is true, that there is a supposed right to life, this right is far from absolute. The death penalty has yet to be found unconstitutional, meaning a person's right to live doesn't supersede the judicial branch handing down a sentence of death for crimes of treason or first degree murder.\n \n There's also the fact that a charge of infringement of one's rights can only be brought against the government and those that work for said government, either on the local, state or federal level. The Supreme Court has said that a private individual can't be prosecuted for violating the constitutional rights of another private individual. I'm afraid I don't know the exact case but I'm sure Bryan can point it out for us if he's asked.\n \n So while someone can certainly be charged for murder it's not possible to charge the average murderer with violating their victim's right to live. If anyone could be charged with such a crime it would be the police who wind up shooting an innocent person by mistake.\n \n Furthermore why should a murder victim's right to live be somehow more important than another person's right to live? If a person has a right to live that means they have a right to defend themselves against those that would kill them. Perhaps you might feel that the average street thug won't feel compelled to end your life if you have nothing of value to give them, but for those of us that are forced to live in areas where crime is very prevalent, or those of us that have physical disabilities that make us unable to fight back unarmed we're unwilling to trust our very lives to the hands of those that would use violence against us for personal gain.\n \n Case in point. A criminal's supposed right to life can't be regarded as more important than the right to life of their victim.\n \n In terms of proper comparison, this entire argument of yours would be like saying an abusive husband has every right to live, but his wife not only has no such right to live, she doesn't even have the right to take steps to defend herself against being murdered because that might violate her husband's right to live. \n \n \nIf you can't control the use of guns, then ban them.\n\n \n Society has more than a sufficient amount of gun control laws in place to govern every possible action one could think of committing with a gun at any given time. We have laws regarding barrel length, size, caliber, function, mechanical safeties, magazine capacities, storage, purchase, transport, ownership, etc. But what we don't have are laws that criminals will absolutely refuse to violate for their own personal gain. We simply don't have the ability to control the actions of those that choose not to obey the law and follow the rules that society demands. For that reason we have prisons and the death penalty to serve as methods of punishment for failure to comply and obey.\n \n \nWe are sick of the violence.\n\n \n You have no right to be sick of violence that isn't our fault to begin with. However we do have a right to be sick of people like you that choose to make us a scapegoat for the fact that you don't want to deal with the existence of the criminals who are actively engaging in violent actions that put others in jeopardy. We're sick of watching the news and seeing stories about killers who skipped out in bail and killed again. We're sick of hearing about illegal immigrants who are in this country when they should've been deported for heinous crimes. We're sick of the justice system giving unfair examples to drug dealers and crime lords while at the same time prosecuting average citizens for comparatively minor crimes in a tyrannical fashion. We're sick of the rich simply being able to buy their way out of whatever trouble they might get into while the poor have no choice but go to prison for crimes they didn't commit. We're sick of plea bargains being something that's offered up because a trial would simply take too long. We're sick of being told that we should apologize for having certain rights and actually having the nerve to exercise them freely.\n \n \nGeorge Vreeland Hill\n\n \n You name has been noted. We have seen the enemy and you are one of them.",

That opinion was basically claiming that a constitutional right can be ruled moot in the name of promoting one group's opinion of what they consider \"public safety\". But the standard of \"public safety\" is open to interpretation over time and from one group to another, so it's very dangerous to take one group's interpretation of an intangible standard and make that the norm. It's even more dangerous to accept one group's opinion that their definition of a standard should be seen as more important than the integrity of the Constitution itself.\n\n \n And then let's not forget that when the math is done Chicago's handgun ban saved only a maximum of 38 people a year, while violating the constitutional rights of some 3 million residents in the city (domestic violence victims included) for the duration of its existence. \n \n Far more good could have come from the ban never having existed. Domestic violence victims shouldn't have to rely on the courts to provide them impotent protection that is nonexistent outside of the courtroom and away from the police.",
