   "Well, if you can't stop disgrace you have to be at the head of it. To all appearances this is credo of new Georgian power. Unfortunately new democratic power can to put Georgia to order, corruption is rising, weapons and drugs trade is on the former level and Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs can't do anything with it.\n As a result of it Georgian president Saakashvili took the volitional decision to get control over drugs and weapons traffic. Well, by this way Georgian officials will get another source of revenue and will direct drugs traffic in profitable course (Central Asia - Europe). According Saakashvili's order all drags traffic in Georgia is controlling by the head of parliament committee for defense and security Targamadze and Minister of Internal Affairs Merabishvili. \n As I know such president's decision came not at once. Saakashvili took it as soon as financial injections from USA and EU reduced. The fact is that Saakashvili can't feed his army of officials because of he have to give an account for acquired money which accumulate at his foreign accounts.",
