A lot of people seem to not fully understand the effects of the last election. The democrats won. That should not be a big deal, except for the fact that it should have been statistically impossible for them to take both houses of congress. Republican gerrymandering was thought to have completely removed the democrats ability to gain control on the senate, and should have limited their majority in the house to a single (or maybe 2) seats. Up until the last election, 400 seats in the house of representatives were considered \"safe\" for the incumbents.\n \n In order for the democrats to take the victory they did, nearly 25% of republican voters had to have changed their allegiance...at least for that election. Democratic victories were not just limited to house races that were considered \"up for grabs\", they took several \"safe\" seats as well. They did the same in the senate.\n \n Currently, republicans still have a chance of regaining control in the future because the districts they drew at the state level are still active...they have effectively picked their voters. The real problem for the republicans is not at the federal level at all, it is at the state level. The Bush administrations corruptness and irresponsibility and their supporters misappropriation of the republican label have left a sour taste in the voters mouth for anything with an elephant on it. The country is starting to shift away from the republicans at the critical state level...where districts are drawn.\n \n If the democrats can leverage this for their own round of gerrymandering, It may well be that we do not see republicans in control of congress for a decade or more. \n \n Given the stakes, the Republicans are more than willing to burn bush at the stake to preserve their future power base. Before slapping a partisan label on things, you really need to look into who is on board with them. In this case it certainly NOT just the democrats. \n \n Even the push to impeach bush was not a partisan move. Several republicans were behind it. Pelosi promised not to allow an impeachment because there was fear (and possibly justifiable) that if the republicans got behind the impeachment effort they would be able to convince voters that they were keeping their onw house in order and it would allow them to distance themselves from their image as a \"rubber stamp\" congress for Bush. The dems know that the only way they can hope to keep control or expand their control is by keeping the republicans and the Bush administration closely associated in the publics mind. Career republican politicians all over the country are trying despratly to kill that image.",

   ". . . .It happened in 1993 on a scale nearly 10 times that of the present (gasp) scandal. US Attorneys ARE political appointees.\nAnd it happened in 2001 when Bush fired all but 2 U.S. Attorneys, whom he retained because they were devoted Republicans--even though Democratic President Bill Clinton had appointed them to vacancies. \n \n. . . . Take one US President at a salary of $85.00/hour, add a committee of 20-30 Senators each of whom is paid approximately $85.00/ hour. Add the congressional staff members who are generally underpaid, but are numerous. Subrtract the work these senators, staffers, and chief executive would have done and the result = a stupendouos waste of time and money to determine that 8 US attorneys have been fired. Then again, if congress is tied up in hearings about the US Attorneys, they aren't passing a minimum wage hike, so perhaps it is economical after all.\nAnd what about the $80 million that mindless Republicans spent to investigate Bill Clinton and a little blue dress?\n \n. . . . . Asking questions under oath is not irrelevant. Asking irrelevant questions under oath is irrelevant. These things are called fishing expeditions because a wide net does not discriminate in the fish it catches.\nNice parroting of the talking points, Mutz.\n \n. . . . . On Mt Palomar, there is a telescope that can view objects at the edge of the universe. The Hubble Telescope, orbiting the earth, can prize detail from farther then that. If you could conceivable place the Mt. Palomar telescope inside the Hubble telescope, you still would not have enough magnifying power to find anything resembling a non-partisan inquiry in the present congress.\nImpressive bit of misleading bloviating, Mutz. Your handlers must be proud.\n \n. . . . . So if the firing of 93 attorneys by Clinton did not hamper the wheels of justice, how will Bush derail the judicial system by firing 8?\nBush fired all of Clinton's U.S. Attorneys save two in 2001. Why do the mindless parrots keep ignoring that historic little fact?\n \n. . . . . You have to travel all the way back to post 16 for your answer. Then again, your short term memory has apparently been compromised as ye cannot recall the attorney or travel staff firings under President (sic) Clinton. For your benefit, here is the post again:\nI didn't see what that has to do with my imputed ability to interrogate witnesses, imputed only by yourself, by the way.\n \n. . . . . Not sure who you are attempting to attack here, but it does not strengthen your argument. Actually, it rather explains why the President and his aides are loathe to place themselves under oath to be questioned by those of your ilk.\n \n Since you brought up the subject of brain death, your question regarding the nice non-partisan inquiry would be sufficient evidence for removal of your feeding tube in Florida. Go into the light Simone!\nBush and his minions are deathly afraid to go under oath because of all the criminal conduct that would be uncovered.",

I would hazzard back to the creation of such positions.\n \n So simone, has it or has it not happened.

Have I explained it in enough detail for you?\n\n \n I am a government employee. Serving at the pleasure of the executive means just that. Serving at their pleasure. They \"tender resignations\" as a courtesy. You will note, clintone accepted them all. If they had not he would have fired them. \n \n YOU CLEARLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANYTHING WORKS!\n \n Firing 8 attorneys is nothing. Bush, or his delegates, are entitled to do so. It is legitimate and normal. Your statement that it has never occurred is simply ridiculous.\n \n From FindLaw:\n \n \nAn Historical Perspective on the Controversy over U.S. Attorney Firings:\n In Making Its Inquiry, Congress Must Not Ignore That the Power to Remove is an Incident of the Power to Appoint - And Both are Necessary for the Proper Enforcement of Law\n By DOUGLAS KMIEC \n ---- \n Monday, Mar. 19, 2007\n \n Recently, there has been much talk of a \"scandal\" in the Department of Justice - based on claims that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales improperly allowed politics to govern the removal of a number of U.S. Attorneys. The facts still remain to be ascertained, by Congressional inquiry. Hopefully, the facts will show that the law was administered without partisanship or favoritism. \n \n As Congress inquires into this matter, it must be careful not to subvert the intended constitutional structure, and historical traditions in this area, by allowing its own political calculus or motivations to play a role.\n \n From a historical perspective, the supervisory relationship between the President, his Attorney General and the nation'sbranch law offices, the U.S. Attorney's Offices, is quite well-established. Thus, Congress should examine the relevant history, before making potentially baseless accusations concerning Attorney General Gonz\u00e1les's efforts to oversee his department.\n \n The History of The Relationship Between the Attorney General and Local U.S. Attorney's Offices\n \n At the founding of the Republic, the contours of the relationship between the Attorney General and U.S. Attorneys were perplexing, and unsatisfactorily-defined. In those times, supervision of U.S. Attorneys was rather oddly given to the State Department, which had little interest in such matters; after all, U.S. Attorneys' jurisdiction is overwhelmingly domestic, not international. As a result, U.S. Attorneys pretty much did as much (or as little) as they wanted. \n \n Appointed in 1790, Edmund Randolph, America's first Attorney General, wisely asked for \"directive\" authority over the independently-minded officers who ran local U.S. Attorneys' offices. However, Congress adjourned without addressing his request - and as a consequence, Attorneys General regrettably were compelled to operate in a rather haphazard way for close to 80 years. (Randolph even received only a half salary and was expected to supplement his income with the private practice of law. Ruefully, Randolph would describe himself as something of \"a mongrel\" settling for the scraps from the Cabinet's table.) \n \n By 1870, however, Congress had recognized both the need to create a formal Department of Justice, and the importance of placing the Department's components under well-articulated lines of authority. The value of executive supervision of local offices had finally been grasped. \n \n Historically-uninformed voices seeking short-term political advantage jeopardize this value with hasty calls for Gonzales's removal or resignation. Any claims that the Attorney General ought to take a hands-off approach regarding local U.S. Attorney's Offices are historically inaccurate. Worse, they ask us to repeat a mistake that Congress reversed as far back as 1870.\n \n Historically, the Executive Has Received the Benefit of the Doubt on Removals of Executive Branch Officials\n \n Not only does the Attorney General historically have authority with respect to local U.S. Attorney's Offices, but he (or she) has also enjoyed the benefit of the doubt on removals of executive officers such as U.S. Attorneys, including those subject to Senate confirmation. \n \n Why? Quite simply because it is the executive who is in the best position to evaluate U.S. Attorneys' performance, and who is responsible for it. In 1923, Chief Justice Taft, the only member of the Supreme Court to have also served as president of the United States, affirmed that removal authority vis-\u00e0-vis executive officers, even those subject to Senate confirmation, was an incident of the president's power to nominate, not the Senate's power to confirm. Taft put it this way in the landmark case of Myers v. United States: \"The power to prevent the removal of an officer who has served under the President is different from the authority to consent to or reject his appointment. When a nomination is made, it may be presumed that the Senate is, or may become, as well advised as to the fitness of the nominee as the President, but in the nature of things the defects in ability or intelligence or loyalty in the administration of the laws of one who has served as an officer under the President are facts as to which the President, or his trusted subordinates, must be better informed than the Senate, and the power to remove him may therefor be regarded as confined for very sound and practical reasons, to the governmental authority which has administrative control. The power of removal is incident to the power of appointment, not to the power of advising and consenting to appointment, . . .\" (Emphasis added.)\n \n Today, the powers of the office of the Attorney General fully reflect Taft's insight. It is described as the \"chief law enforcement officer of the United States, . . .guid[ing] the world's largest law office in the central agency for enforcement of federal laws.\" The United States Attorneys serve as the nation's principal litigators, but as the DOJ website clearly specifies, they do so \"under the direction of the Attorney General.\" \n \n True, a wise Attorney General will give sufficient professional latitude to each U.S. Attorney in order to best accomplish the prosecutorial and civil defense needs of each district. But latitude is not unaccountability - just as the refusal to micromanage is not an abdication of authority.\n \n The Bush Administration Hardly Invented What Is Long-Established Removal Authority \n \n History reveals that a defense of executive removal authority is far from merely the product of some wild-eyed theory of \"unitary executive\" invented by the Bush administration. Rather, it is -- as every president since Ulysses S. Grant has insisted -- a vital principle, consistent with \"a faithful and efficient administration of the government.\" After all, said Grant, \"What faith can an executive put in officials forced upon him, [or] those, too, whom he has suspended for reason?\" Put another way, a boss without power to hire and fire will typically be crippled in his or her effectiveness. \n \n The eight dismissed U.S. Attorneys may all be fine men and women; that is not inconsistent with their having been dismissed. The Constitutional system, as it has taken form over our history, puts the choice of dismissal solely in the President's hands (as he is chooses to be informed by his Attorney General). Accordingly, the President is within his rights to dismiss a U.S. Attorney even for the simple reason that he preferred someone else for the job.\n \n Some have suggested at least some of the U.S. Attorneys were dismissed in order to shield criminal wrongdoing - that is, dismissed so that criminal prosecutions that they had overseen would fade away or be resolved with lenient plea agreements. Before making such serious accusations, however, the Congress ought to come forward with hard proof, not the whine of innuendo. \n \n Moreover, and significantly, none of the dismissed prosecutors has come anywhere close to making that accusation. Surely, it should not be inferred.\n \n In making its inquiry, then, Congress should be careful not to subvert what history has so well provided: the executive's ability to dismiss its officers is the structural mechanism by which the President \"takes care\" that the law is faithfully executed.\n",
