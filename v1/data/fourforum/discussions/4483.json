   "Homosexuals are searching for their gender identity through sexual contact with the same sex. However, they find that the answers to their gender identity are not there. Because the roots of homosexuality are basically non-sexual needs, the homosexual finds that healing cannot come through same-sex sexual relationships.\n\n \n Well, your description of ex-gays may very well be accurate, but this paragraph here makes some very vital mistakes. First, homosexuals are generally not searching for gender identity by engaging in same-sex relationships. Homosexuals, I would argue, are people who wish to spend their lives with someone of the same sex and who fall in love with someone of the same sex. This generally means that they are physically attracted to someone of the same sex as well. It may be true that answers to gender identity do not lie in a same-sex relationship, but that is not the reason for engaging in that relationship in the first place; the reason is the desire to spend one's live with someone of the same sex instead of someone of the opposite sex.\n \n The needs of the homosexual may be sexual or nonsexual depending on that individual; I think that most, in fact, do have non-sexual needs as you claim. The are more likely to need the emotional support that comes from a loving relationship. Yet contrary to your claims, any healing a homosexual needs (which might be no healing) is as able to come from a same-sex relationship as it is from an opposite-sex relationship.\n \n This doesn't mean that an ex-gay might not have had some bad relationships or may hold religious views which tell him that what I have written is not true, but for the vast majority of homosexuals, it is true.",

   "ok back to square one....define changed. this is how \"they\" define changed.\n \n \nWhat Do We Mean By Change? \n Some skeptics erroneously assume that by change we always mean (or should mean) a 180 degree shift from 100% homosexual to 100% heterosexual in all behaviors, interests, attractions and thoughts, forever after. Anything less than that, some skeptics like to argue, isn't real change. Some look for evidence of \"only\" a 170 degree shift or \"only\" a 100 degree shift, and cry \"failure!\" \n \n The truth is that any degree of change toward greater peace, satisfaction and fulfillment, and less shame, depression and darkness, is change well worth pursuing. For most people who seek change, heterosexuality is not actually the ultimate goal; happiness is. For them, happiness is not contingent on sexuality alone, but on living a life congruent with their values, beliefs and life goals. \n \n So, unlike those who argue that nothing less than a 180 degree turn \"counts\" as change, the men and women who actually seek change are often quite content with a much subtler shift. To be free from the constant pull of homosexual desires, to have a happy marriage, to have children, and to live a life they believe to be in line with God's will for them -- many ask for nothing more \n \n \n\n \n I put into bold those parts of this I find suspect.

   "http://www.ralliance.org/SpitzerStudy.html\n \nAnother criticism revolves around what is considered to be 'success'. The religious organization is admittedly anti-science. Its measure of \"success\" has little if anything to do with a change of sexual orientation. Randy Thomas, spokesman for Exodus International, the religious organization that fed subjects to the Spitzer study had this to say. \"So what is a nice faith based ministry like us doing hanging out with secular therapists? We were giving testimony to the righteousness of Christ of course. ... orientation shift is not *the* goal of Exodus. Jesus Christ Himself is the goal worth pursuing; loving and Serving Him is it's[sic] own reward. We do believe that orientation shift or complete orientation change can happen as a by-product of pursuing holiness but is not in and of itself the only barometer of success.\"\n \n As shown in the work of Michael Schroeder and Ariel Shidlo, a scientific measure of success arrives at very different results. Out of a sample of 202 people who met the criteria laid down (that they were initially primarily gay), the following facts emerged: \n \n 1) Many of the therapists were behaving unethically. For example 1/4 of those who had been through the treatments had been pressured into joining, almost none of those who felt it wasn't working were given advice on alternative counseling, and most were misled about the position of the APAs and about the supposed success rates of 'ex-gay' treatments. \n \n 2) Most patients go through an initial 'honeymoon' with the 'ex-gay' movement, followed later by disillusion. \n \n 3) Because of the hostility and lack of support by most 'ex-gay' therapists to 'failures', most patients continued to lie to their therapists about their progress. This is almost certainly the reason why Exodus and Narth therapists continue to claim 30-50% success rates, when outsiders find much less. \n \n 4) Based on self-reporting by the patients to Schroeder and Shidlo, 14% did manage long-term to either greatly reduce or completely stop homosexual practices. Of these, 5% were 'struggling'. Another 5% reported being reasonably happy (almost all of this group were celibate). \n \n 5) Only 4% (i.e. 8 patients) reported a shift in sexual orientation from 5 or more to 3 or less on a 1-7 scale of hetero/homosexual balance. Of these - the only ones who could perhaps be classified as 'ex-gays' - 7 out of 8 put down as occupation that they were 'ex-gay' counselors. The eighth person refused a follow-up interview. Obviously there is a serious conflict of interest/secondary gain issue among this group. \n",
