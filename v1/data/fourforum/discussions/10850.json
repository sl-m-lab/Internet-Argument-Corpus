   "Apology accepted, JT. \n \n Endorsements reflect on candidates significantly for me, too. Though certainly they are not a sole criteria for choosing who one votes for, any more than gender or race is a sole criteria.\n \n I also don't know what you mean by generic insults like \"socialist pig.\" Or \"just because she's a woman\" like you are mind-melding with hundreds of thousands of female Democrats.\n \n Sounds to me like you are voting as superficially as some of people you imagine are.\n \n Look, just some of the reasons I like Clinton, whether or not you support any of these positions: She's for universal health care, universal pre-k, expanded access to college education, supports science, supports civil rights, is endorsed by major unions in highly important American industries and professions, has committed to getting us out of Iraq (as much as any of the Dems), supports Israel, is anti-Muslim bigotry, is pro-choice, has pioneered in anti voting fraud legislation, is pro-NAFTA reform, pro alternative energy development, pro environment, is a woman who is pro women's rights in an international arena where that is an increasingly serious concern, is a groundbreaker in any number of other political areas, has powerful connections to get things done, is the first woman who's had a chance at the highest office, has more experience and insight into the presidential position than any other Democratic candidate, is the most articulate, has the best leadership skills, has the best foreign policy background, is best with economic issues, best on family issues, best in education, will make excellent (and most likely, the best) high court appointments, and, she's unbelievably talented to have gotten this far in a man's world ... m'd god, if you're a Democrat (and I'm sure you're not), what more does a gal have to do to prove herself just on substance, and not on appearances?\n \n And you better believe she's got 35 years of experience. Sure, not in that book where women work for years and years without pay, and, without recognition, and, without advancement opportunities.\n \n I'm not opposed to any of the democratic candidates, and the nation shall speak. But don't tell me I'm voting for someone just because she's a woman.\n \n I'm voting for her because I think she's the best candidate AND she's a woman. Damn straight, it's about time a woman went into that job.\n \n Cry your hearts out, Republicans. None of your candidates can hold a candle to any of the Democrats seeking office. None of your candidates are women, are they, the Republican party being the party of bigotry that it is.\n \n Your Republican party is in shambles, and we have all paid the price for Republican stupidity, corruption, selfishness, hypocrisy, and arrogance. The nation is trillions in debt, tens of thousands of people are dead on that Bush cabal oil adventure, we've been attacked by terrorists, our president is subservient to His Majesty, we watched people dying in New Orleans on national television while the president strummed a guitar in San Diego, the Iraqi war drove the global climate to the brink of WW III, thousands of innocent Americans have been spied on or had their civil rights violated, we're torturing people like Nazis, that administration has probably broken laws they should not only be impeached for, but sitting in jail cells for, we're heading into a recession with a housing crisis not seen since the Depression era, the dollar is falling, our popularity world-wide is pure merde, and all since your way of thinking sent us Bush and Co. for two terms.\n \n I didn't vote for him either time. ;)",
