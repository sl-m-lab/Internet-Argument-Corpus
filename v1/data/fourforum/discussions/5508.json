In fact, previously if you DID have a abortion the government would arrest you for it, thus interferring with your personal decision in your personal life. \n \n When Roe Vs Wade was enacted, it merely gave a right that was previous denied and it removed government from the decisions of such actions. Government then took a step back away from your personal life. \n \n I don't think either you or VOR understand what conservatism is, but that's not suprising.

Planned parenthood apparently does nto feel such laws apply. Kline is going after the records here in kansas, and in addition to likely charging whoever impregnated those 14 yr old girls, the doctor that performed the procedure and failed to report the abuse under kansas law is going to loose his license,a nd possiblty do jail time.\n \n I can certainly understand why PP does not want to cough up the records.

For a complete understanding of the conditions and requirements for these disclosures, please review the exact regulatory text at the citations provided. Disclosures for law enforcement purposes are permitted as follows:\n \n \n To comply with a court order or court-ordered warrant, a subpoena or summons issued by a judicial officer, or a grand jury subpoena. The Rule recognizes that the legal process in obtaining a court order and the secrecy of the grand jury process provides protections for the individual's private information (45 CFR 164.512(f)(1)(ii)(A)-(B)).\n \n \n",

The only real difference is that we do not put the kid on the stand. Wven states wehre they DO put the kid on the stand, they should generally be represented by an advocate, and laws/case law regaridng children testifying require a MUCH gentler approach than cross examinign an adult witness.\n \n this does not really matter int he end, though. Even if you have to put the kid through a trial, it si still better than sending them home to continued abuse. Keep in mind here that we are talking CHILDREN, not adults.\n \n Where the PP here is in trouble is for not doing what your local one apparently does, which is calling CPS (though here is is SRS).\n\n \n As you refer to an advocate; that is what the attorney and social worker out here do in tandem. And before any police are called, we call a social worker and an attorney to report to PPHood, so the child has people to back them up and morale support. The police have to ask difficult questions, and this is the practice we've found works best for the child, and the police are able to obtain info much easier.
