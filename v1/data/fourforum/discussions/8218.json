I made the mistake of asking you to step outside that perspective for just a second. You have no idea what it's like to be gay in Spartanburg, SC or Great Falls, MT. Have you been asked to leave a restaurant? I have. I have never been beaten, but have been called \"XXXXXX\" for walking down the street with a boyfriend. More than once, and I got out of there - quick. Plently of people have been beaten or worse. I know some. How often does it happen? Often enough. How often does it have to happen to matter? Yet you seem to feel confident enough to understand the gay experience. How did you get that perspective? Is it from all your gay friends? Also, I don't appreciate the name-calling. It was my opinion, I don't think it is fair to call me narcissistic.\n \n I have to ask how old you are. Because making a comment like \"Be grateful you didn't live back in the early-mid 90s where being black would be much worse\" suggests a lack of historical perspective. I hate to change the subject, but are you implying there is a difference between then and now for black people?\n \n It seems to be a common tactic to dismiss the struggles of some demographic of people by saying something like \"Everyone has their struggles and fights...some are worse than others, but I wouldn't generalize it by sexual orientation, race, or gender.\" I don't understand the logic here. At the risk of \"generalizing\", why is it that these statements mostly seem to come from straight, white, christian males? Could it be because they are privvaledged?",

Unless someone is coming up to you and saying \"are you 2 fags, 'cause if you are I will bring you one check\"...I would think you should have nothing to complain about. Suppose I go out to dinner with a straight female friend, and they only bring one check? Should I be offended that they automatically made a judgement that we were a couple? \n \n You keep talking about \"heterosexual privilege\" like it is what is keeping you down. Get a grip on reality and realize that it is the bigotry, hatred, and ignorance of some heterosexuals that is holding you own. But then again, I think that focusing on issues like this is also a part of what is keeping you down. Ignorance is not simply a heterosexual trait. Let's try to keep our eyes on the balls, shall we people?\n\n \n Yes you should be offended. They should ask the same question to all people. I can not stand being assumed to be a heterosexual. Heterosexual privledge, as with white privledge, is part of the problem.",

When a male and a female are precieved to be a couple and not two males or two females. That needs to change.\n\n \n Welcome to the human race, Matthew. That's not \"heterosexual privilege\"--as I already pointed out, the vast majority (over 90%) of people are straight. It's not privilege; it's people being who they are. That's just the way it is; you're a gay man living in a predominately straight world. Unless some strange genetic mutation takes place in the human race, it's probably going to stay that way.

We (gays) didn't have that option. In fact we couldn't talk to anyone about it, we just had to take it and internalize it. IMHO that is the reason for the high rate of suicide attempts by children that are thought to be gay by their peers (since they haven't had sex yet, they aren't sure of their sexuality). They have no one to confide in or talk to about their feelings. They are left to go to their bedroom, close the door, and hope for death, because life doesn't seem very promising as a 'possibly gay' kid. Heterosexual people can never understand that fact (because they don't really care). That's exactly what the Gay/Straight clubs in schools were trying to address, but some \"Christians\" are against those clubs to! I believe the Christians that fight those types of organizations actually want those poor kids to commit suicide and they're happy they suffer alone. They feel those darn 'possible homo's' deserve to suffer 24/7 at the hands of their 'Christian' children, while their teachers laugh along with them!",
