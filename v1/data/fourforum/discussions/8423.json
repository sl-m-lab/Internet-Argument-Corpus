   "From the Wall Street Journal:\n \n No Dutch Submission\n By SJOERD DE JONG\n July 3, 2006\n Has Holland gone soft on radical Islam? This conclusion seemed inescapable when Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali-born member of parliament and an outspoken critic of Muslim extremism, was threatened with exile last month.\n \n A TV report rehashing an old story -- she lied about her age and full name to secure a Dutch passport after fleeing from an arranged marriage -- led the immigration minister to threaten her citizenship. Over night, it seemed this internationally known defender of Enlightenment values had fallen out of favor with a country more intent on appeasing radical Muslims than protecting a courageous woman who was living under permanent police protection due to Islamist threats on her life.\n \n Last week, though, things have taken a spectacular turn. The government of Christian Democratic Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende fell after the ministers from D66, one of his coalition partners, resigned in protest over how Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk handled the Hirsi Ali affair. It was Ms. Verdonk, a hard-liner on immigration issues and member of the same liberal VVD party as Ms. Hirsi Ali, who threatened to take away her passport. Later Ms. Verdonk backed down under massive criticism from parliament. But then, according to her critics, she pressured Ms. Hirsi Ali into signing a statement that absolved the minister of any guilt for the affair. Ms. Hirsi Ali said she wasn't happy with the statement but signed it anyway to end this quarrel over her passport and start her new work at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. When Mr. Balkenende refused to fire Ms. Verdonk for this \"political blackmail,\" the junior coalition party D66 walked out.\n \n At this stage, early elections in the fall are the likeliest outcome. So it appears Ms. Hirsi Ali, supposedly abandoned by the country in which she found asylum, has now indirectly destroyed the ruling coalition, of which her liberal party was such a prominent member. A strong populist ruler, tough on immigrants, has lost a serious battle to a former asylum seeker.\n \n But it is not quite that simple. Ms. Verdonk and Ms. Hirsi Ali used to be more than just political friends. They were mutual admirers who shared strong views on the need of Muslim integration and the urgency of battling radical Islam. The internationally circulated view that Ms. Hirsi Ali was abandoned or would be exiled for her opinions, as for instance her American publisher claimed in a prominent New York Times ad for her latest book \"The Caged Virgin,\" is not quite true.\n \n First of all, the Dutch elite never abandoned Ms. Hirsi Ali. To the contrary, the citizenship controversy provoked uproar from her many friends in political, intellectual and literary circles, as well as from many of her political opponents who felt outrage at the shameful way that she was treated.\n \n The image of Holland as a country intolerant of critics of Islam is way off. Ever since the rise of Pim Fortuyn (who called Islam \"a backward culture\" that threatens the sexual liberation brought by the 1960s), the silence on immigration and Islam has been shattered. The debate is now public, heated and sometimes ugly. In fact, \"multiculturalism\" has almost become a derogatory term.\n \n Ms. Hirsi Ali in particular enjoyed a freedom to criticize Islam that will be hard to match anywhere else in the world. Her sometimes extreme comments on the prophet Muhammad as a \"tyrant\" and \"pedophile,\" her linking of radical Islam with fascism, her view of Muslims as unenlightened people, her call on newspapers during the Danish cartoon crisis to do their \"duty\" and publish more cartoons -- none of this would have been possible in a country beset by political correctness or cowardice.\n \n Still, many Dutchmen thought Ms. Verdonk was right to want to strip Ms. Hirsi Ali of her passport. So what happened?\n \n Ms. Hirsi Ali became partly the victim of her own success. Exaggerated fears of colonization by Islam have lent great support to Ms. Verdonk's tough stance and literalist reading of Dutch immigration law. What goes for an anonymous asylum seeker should also go for a celebrity politician.\n \n And Ms. Hirsi Ali's tough secularism, partly modeled on French republicanism, alienated the more conservative faction within her own liberal party.\n \n More generally, Ms. Hirsi Ali lost the support of a part of Dutch public opinion. Some even said they would not regret her departure. Even though most of them agree with her views on Islam, they seemed to grow wary of their constant repetition and of the media attention lavished on her. The murder of Theo van Gogh -- a film director who was shot and stabbed by a radical Muslim for collaborating with Ms. Hirsi Ali on \"Submission,\" a movie about Islam's treatment of women -- convinced many Dutchmen that she created more problems than she had solved.\n \n Ms. Hirsi Ali has always been more popular among intellectuals than with ordinary Dutchmen. Reports and pictures of her dining with high society in Washington and New York met with a populist backlash against her. \"Act normal\" is still very much a feature of Dutch self-image, even if Holland is in fact the most liberal country in Western Europe, sometimes extravagantly so.\n \n Fact is, Ms. Hirsi Ali was instrumental in introducing a critical discourse on Islam to the Netherlands. Her radical views that Islam and democracy are incompatible and that the state should promote secularism are now almost common place in the Netherlands. The Dutch, as never before, are grappling with questions of national culture and identity. Ms. Hirsi Ali has warned the Dutch could be demographically conquered by Muslims and will soon find themselves living in \"Eurabia.\" It's a lesson well learned in the Netherlands. Polls show half of the Dutch population regrettably fears or resents Islam. The controversy about Ms. Hirsi Ali's citizenship is an ironic testament to her impact on Dutch society.\n \n Mr. de Jong is deputy editor of NRC Handelsblad.",

   "It's quite a complicated matter. Another factor the author doesn't mention is for example that minister Verdonk acted harsh, but consistent, she is infamous for her cold-hearted approach in enforcing immigration laws, noted run-ins you probably didn't hear about were the Kosovar teen Ta\u00efda Pasic and soccer talent Salomon Kalou whom both were refused citizenship despite having compelling arguments to be granted citizenship under extraordinary circumstances. Had Verdonk done nothing, she could/would be accused of favoritism towards her colleague.\n \n For the reason people don't regret her departure, this is pretty much spot on:\n \n \nMore generally, Ms. Hirsi Ali lost the support of a part of Dutch public opinion. Some even said they would not regret her departure. Even though most of them agree with her views on Islam, they seemed to grow wary of their constant repetition and of the media attention lavished on her. The murder of Theo van Gogh -- a film director who was shot and stabbed by a radical Muslim for collaborating with Ms. Hirsi Ali on \"Submission,\" a movie about Islam's treatment of women -- convinced many Dutchmen that she created more problems than she had solved.\n\n \n The fact that she spent the last 4 years in hiding and/or with 24/7 security also made people wonder why she remained here, her work was made impossible for her and frankly the US offers a far better platform for her confrontational attitude since we generally conduct concensus-driven politics. It's darn hard for a government to approach muslims when you got an equivalent MP/congressman \"exposing all depravities\" without a single shred of nuance amid your ranks. I would say that Hirsi Alli was perhaps indirectly or directly blamed for enflaming the interethnic tensions between native Dutch and new Dutch.\n \n I do not condone this madness in our parliament, I turned redfaced quite a few times when asked about it, I remember that a prominent partymember of VVD noted that the Netherlands would look like a fool with Fortuyn as PM, and then they come with this (thanks guys, now I remember why I don't vote for ya :P).\n \n A blogger I read noted wryly this morning that it's amazing, Mexico is in crisis: if there is not a convincing win for either candidate, things can get messy. Israel is working hard towards it's own demise after a brief lull again. The Netherlands? We just spend 2 weeks in crisis in which nothing really happened. Ms Hirshi Ali is still Dutch citizen, minister Verdonk is still immigration minister, the government fell but will be reformed (essentially just reshuffled) and govern with consent of parliament (though they cannot introduce unannounced legislature).",
