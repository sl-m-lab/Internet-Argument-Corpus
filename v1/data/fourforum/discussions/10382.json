   "Yeah, a grandfatherly old wisened figure who's got maD sKILLzz\n \n Merlynn Gandolff the Potter.\n \n He was raised a potter, but in his spare time, studied the ancient wisdom of the ancients and lernt how to manipulate the spiritual laws. He's part of the cabal of learned ones who shape the destiny on mankind. His mother was a medusa, so you can't look at him or you'll turn to stone and loose your soul. Fortunatly, he knows this and in his kindness and mercy has hidden himself away from most of humanity. But, with his magic infinity ball (black, with a white circle with the 8 sideways infinity device inside) he can know all with simply skrying.\n These items can also be found in most stores...'for even a child' can use them. It's part of his 'shaping the destiny of mankind' thing. \n \n He's spoken of in many ancient tales and myths (hey, if the Christians can use this to justify the flood...we can do it too). Sooo...he must be real!\n \n And, while he's ALL KNOWING (this is an immutable fact) he does respect privacy rights. NO, there ISN'T a contradiction here!\n \n \n @fjp8000\n Of course we get to eat cow.\n All cow is HOLY COW!\n Also, stating \"HOLY COW\" is a magical blessing used to ward away evil and bad omens. \n The heretic, Bartholemew of Springfield, is known to curse the true believers with his curses of \"Don't have a cow, man.\" *ptewy* \n But, the injestion of cow is known to strengthen the soul and fortify the spirit. And the milk of the cow makes your bones strong.\n All of COW is good.\n Those who don't like COW for any reason are either misguided or diabolical entities in disguise. However, if they are willing to purchase the $1,000 spiritual cleansing, they are purified for a full 10 YEARS! Well worth it if you ask me. They'd no longer have to injest the holy bovine flesh, taking it's divine essence into themselves.\n \n The infidels know as the group, Perpetual Evil Treatment of All (PETA), should be targeted for constant ridicule and discriminated against. The light of the sacred is forever denied them...unless they purchase the $5,000 spiritual cleansing and avow to refrain from speaking negatively against members of this MOST HOLY order...for at least a month. Then, only snide comments are allowed behind closed doors (never in public...the Potter is watching there...see above). This will give a 'covering' for about 2 years to the individual. A $10,000 cleansing would cover for at least 5 years.",

Having children dilutes your spiritual powers of cheaztgn (the tgn is silent). Furthermore, upon death, you should sign all of your wealth over to us so that we may purify it and pass it on to you in the after life where you can use it again.\n \n As for poor people. They can't afford abortions. They also shouldn't have them because one of their children may survive their harsh and deprived upbringings to become rich. This feat will sanctify their parents giving them a cokey that they can use for special benefits and priveledges in the after life. They also get a semi-cokey for grandchildren who become successful and a prot for any other descendents after a grandchild who become financial successful and benefit the church. So, over time (as slow time), they can accumulate wealth in the 'Great Funnel of Wealth Transference' in the afterlife. See, the 'trickle-down' is one of the spiritual laws.\n Also, poor people tendto be uneducated and assist in forming a solid base of militant believers willing to take up arms against the enemies of the church in times of need. Such as when waging a 'Cruhad war of acquirement.' or a 'Cruhad war of defense from slander and liabel'. Or, even a 'Cruhad war of voting to change laws so the church can benefit.'\n \n There, that's the churches official and unchanging policy on this highly sesitive subject.

   "Although I think you have something with that \"Dynanamics\" idea, I think your prohibitions and restrictions are too easy. \n \n More dietary restrictions, like don't mix fruit and seafood. \n \n Or how about prohibiting a Trinity of Dairy, no Afredo sauce with its triad of cream, butter and cheese. You would need to only outlaw Alfredo sauce itself, and make lots of goofy loopholes about using cream, butter and cheese in more sacred ways. There could be St. Alfredo of the Damned, the story of the angel chef turned demon when he blasphemed the cow.\n \n Margarine needs to be worked in here somehow; I would make it blasphemous, probably. Although maybe there needs to be something more seductively tempting that you can \"cheat\" with, before repenting and paying Zardoz a lot of money for indulgences.\n \n I have always thought the Mormons had something with the underwear deal. You could have holy socks that are disctinctive, candy apple red, so you could stand out as one of the faithful. Of course you could only buy the blessed socks from the church and it would be a sin to wear any single pair more than once a week, ensuring the faithful buy at least 7 pairs. They must be burned after one year of course. Holy socks have an expiration date.\n\n \n You really need to study cultic and religious formation.\n In their beginning, they are very easy on the ears and simple to follow. That way you get massive converts...who later help brainwash more followers for you...like their own kids.\n \n Over time, the contradictions and rules problems start to accumulate resulting in lots of fun, excitement and INTERESTING TIMES...most of which, the starters of the movements are no longer alive to see.\n \n As great procrastinators do, push all that hard stuff off to tomorrow. Let some other Tru-B'liever make it up.\n All I want is a CASH COW.\n \n Repeat after me.\n Cash Cow Now!\n Cash Cow Now!\n Cash Cow Now!\n Cash Cow Now!\n \n See?

Magic.\n The more force used, the more results gained.\n \n And, you'll know your (non-selfish) requests are met when you see results you're happy with.\n After all, the Potter aids those who do everything for themselves...or manipulate others to do it for them.
