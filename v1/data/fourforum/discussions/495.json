I was simply pointing out that this statement was kind of harsh coming from someone who had just given me a \"verbal spanking\" for telling someone that without accepting Christ into their life, they were going to hell. What's wrong with saying that? Do you tell people that, or are you afraid to tell other people that they are going to hell without Christ lest you \"offend\" any of them?

The reason why you believe this is because you haven't read the Bible. God said that in order to be a Christian you have to accept Christ into your life and ask forgiveness from your sins. \n \n John 3:3-12\n \n \"In reply Jesus declared, \"I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.\" \"How can a man be born when he is old?\" Nicodemus asked. \"Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!\" Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" \"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked. \"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things? I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?\"",

The first problem is, 99% of the people who truly love Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior are not rapists, murderers, etc. The second problem is, God loving a person and that person going to Heaven are completely different things. It's God's love that allows you to go to Heaven.\n \n Crim-\n \n \nBy what standard does 'love' include causing infinite suffering? Do you intentionally cause suffering to anyone you love?\n\n \n Sometimes God allows Satan to cause suffering to His people and to Christians in order for them to grow stronger and as a form of punishment.

If you have a 12 year old son and you find out he drinks, smokes, does more drugs than you can name are you going to ground him from using phone or are you going to spank the hell out of him? If you ground him from using the phone, you're a terrible father for tapping him on the wrist. In other words, you aren't showing love. \n \n Then again, maybe you think people shouldn't be punished for committing crimes, sins, disobediance, etc. \n \n \nAnd to think that the God in question needs someone to acknowledge their presence as their lord and master before this all covering evil falls away,\n \n\n \n The only person who can take away your sin is God. No human can ever cleanse himself of his sins, so get over it.\n \n \nso they must be slaves to this master, to be free, seems like an incredible use of doublethink.\n\n \n Depends on your definition of a slave, I guess.\n \n \nand I cannot reconcile the many differing and somewhat contradictory nature of your God.

However, there is also a difference from spanking them, and putting him in solitary confinement where he gets beaten everyday for the rest of his life!\n \n As for prisons, etc, I wish we didn't have to have them. If I had the resources, I'd make them not be around. By the resources, I mean if I had the power of an omnipotent god, if it were needed to keep people away from society for some time, I would either put them in an institute to determine why they committed their crime, would they do it again, etc, or I'd put them in an alternative, but not horrible, universe, for as long as was needed.

However, I cannot really think of any area within the Bible where it explicitly says you cannot rape someone. What it does say is that it is a property crime and you must pay the father for the daughter after she is raped. I'm sorry, but I don't advocate stoning rapists, and I certainly don't advocate stoning the poor victims of the rape. And I have some leeway to say what I want in this category, as I am the child of a rape attack. AS for sexual immorality, define it. Do you mean sexually molesting children? Again, I think that harms and forces something on someone. If the sex is consensual though, and the person fully understands what they are doing, I am completely for letting them do what they want. The only part of sexual immorality that I could understand would be child molesting, which I do not agree with for the reasons stated above.\n \n Also, if the Christian worldview is against rape, why does Moses say that Yahweh allows the Israelites to take the virgin children of the Midianites captive to do with what they would in Numbers 31?",

   "You say that I have as an obligation of a parent, to upbring my child. I do not think that pain is good for that. I think it harms the child (it certainly psychologically screwed me up for a few years) I will do my best as a parent. I however, think that treating the child as a thinking adult, when it can think in the circumstances, and not like a 2 year old, when they are clearly beyond those circumstances. You say that only those people who understand can go to hell, but still, hell would not be to teach a lesson would it be? A lesson is to teach a child so that it does not continue with this behavior. If the punishment is eternal, then the child would learn nothing, as it never has a second chance. Also, there are those of us (myself included) who in your worldview, would make it to heaven, simply because we cannot believe. I assure you, I tried it, after leaving Christianity, to believe it all again (mainly because I hated the loss of the security and love I felt as a Christian from what I thought was a feeling from an all protecting diety) and could not believe it.\n \n I would like your information on how pain is the best teaching tool. It never taught me a single bloody thing as a child. When someone sat down and explained something to me, then I understood and generally went along with what they wanted me to do. If they spanked me, I ignored them or was more rebellious because of it.\n \n As for stealing, I said I didn't consider it wrong. I never said I wouldn't try to stop you, as unfortunely, I must keep myself alive with material possessions. I do not, however, consider it wrong. At least in an objective sense. It is wrong for me to steal from people, but that is my subjective moral view on things.\n \n As for my worldview being incorrect, that is half wrong and half right. It is right to me, but wrong to part of the world. Everything is perception. One person sees things a different way from every other person.\n \n Also, adultery is not rape. They are too different things. Adultery is a sexual \"crime\". Rape is a violent crime. Also, adultery is consensual, whereas rape is not. \n \n As for the 13 year old, if she understands everything she is doing, etc, then yes, there isn't anything wrong with it. Some of the greatest philosophers and geniuses in history had had sex by 13 and came out fine. It all depends on the individual. There are some that aren't ready for sex at 20. Unfortunely, we generally have to make a judgment as to when the majority are ready for sex. This is the age of consent.\n \n \n Quote:\n \n Sex is God's greatest gift that allows a man and a woman to become as close together as possible. It's not supposed to be animalistic, freaky, disgusting, etc. Another thing, the reason for sex is so godly offspring can be produced. \n \n \n Your opinion, not mine. My view of sex is different than yours. You say it is not to be certain ways. I personally have no preference of what people do in their own homes. To each their own, I say. And I don't remember any part of the Bible saying \"missionary position only\" if that is what you are implying as the only \"good\" sex.\n \n Quote:\n \n Well, first, those were Hebrews, not Christians. Secondly, the scripture doesn't say they raped them, it says \"keep them for yourselves.\" That could mean rape, however, I'm pretty sure that was not Moses's intention. Also, the Hebrews considered it impure to lie with non-Hebrew women or men, so if there was any sexual immorality going on it was very small. However, that DOESN'T mean it was justified or right.\n \n Hebrews following the god Yahweh, which happens to be YOUR GOD. This was supposedly allowed by YOUR GOD in your book. As for it not being rape... they just murdered their brothers, fathers, and mothers. Do you REALLY think these girls are going to be happy to be sleeping with a bunch of foreigners? And part of these women were given as the Lord's share. Did he accept that? Why didn't he strike the Israelites down if they did such a henious crime? He did it in books before and after this for what could be considered lesser offensives (like burning incense to him).",
