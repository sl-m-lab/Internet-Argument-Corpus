   "It isn't sacred ground, it's a place where a lot of people died because of the US foreign policy of policing the world, and having troops stationed in nations of people who do not want them there.

So you have no excuse to \n \n a) Be believing this lie.\n \n and \n \n b) Be perpetuating it.\n \n Iran is no military threat to the united states. It is no military threat to Israel. It is, in fact, no threat to anything except the continued empire of debt the neocons in power are hell bent on accumulating. They are, at this time, intent on propagandising against Iran until they can attain 30 or 40% public support for aggression against it. This visit is opposed entirely because it would undermine administration propaganda efforts.\n \n \nObviously, it is a propaganda ploy on his part, and if we allowed him to do it it would just embolden his followers and give him the publicity he seeks.\"\n\n \n Yeah that makes so much sense, the president of Iran paying tribute to the victims of 9/11 and expressing his sorrow for their deaths would \"embolden his followers\", embolden them to what, also condemn terrorism?\n \n If you are truly interested in preventing the psychological changes that create hate of the united states and breed terrorism, there is only one solution - get out of the business of global military domination, stop meddling in the politics of other nations, stop bombing and invading other nations and people. These are the actions that create terrorism, killing innocents abroad and leading to the deaths of innocents at home.",
