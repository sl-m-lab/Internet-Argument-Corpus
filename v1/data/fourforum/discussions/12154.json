How come it's never the killer being shot in the face when he's crouching to find somebody hiding behind their desk?\n \n It never fails. People like you, when you make a statement like this, are saying that you trust cold blooded murderers more than honest citizens, and you're claiming that by simply letting them kill without opposition, they'll somehow decide to kill fewer people and let others live once they get their fill.\n \n \nIt terrifies me to walk the streets of Colorado not knowing who is packing.\n\n \n Unless you have wicked intentions and are a mugger then you have nothing to fear...unless you're psychologically disturbed and suffer from agoraphobia or some other mental condition which instills great fear in being in a public place or around people. If such is the case then become a recluse and never leave your home, or seek psychological care.\n \n \nThis is a good way of turnoing a shooting into a massacre.\n\n \n And unarmed people are a great way of ensuring that a massacre can happen. How long was it before the SWAT team got into the Columbine school, three hours? The two killers could have slaughtered every living person within that time and never have been caught, and all because they were exclusively armed.\n \n If shooting back really turned a shootout into a massacre, countless people would die only after the police showed up due to their ability to shoot back.\n \n \nFace facts, the OK Corral is a nice legend, but completely inappropriate in the 21st Century, except, of course to those who go to Chuck Norris and Rambo films and think they are documentaries.\n\n \n As I seem to recall, the OK Corral was an incident between several lawmen, and several criminals. So unless you're speaking out in favor of the police being unarmed in an attempt to encourage criminals not to be shooting at them, then such a reference is completely pointless and meant only to scare the uninformed.\n \n How about you actually try and prove that what you claim would actually happen. Can you show me some examples of an public shooter being shot at by a non-police individual, and that act escalating into a massacre-level event, with some of the dead being killed by the non-police individual?\n \n I'm willing to discuss things with you on a logical basis.

The criminals? Or the CCW'ers who have taken training, went to the police, had an interpol, FBI, and state background check, and have never broken the law? I know the difference between a CCW holder and a police officer is the metal \"badge\" talisman the police have pinned to their chest. I guesss this makes their sidearm O.K.

Evidently, it would have made all the difference in me being a trustworthy human being or a \"scary gun nut\". \n \n \nThis is a good way of turnoing a shooting into a massacre.\n\n \n I'm a little fuzzy on the difference.

You can't say A is B. Using any kind of logic, please explain to me how a firearm is bad for a human being to defend his life with in one breath, then argue how it is good for a human being to defend his life with in the next?\n \n It is impossible to make any kind of sense by saying that a human being who carries a gun for self defense is dangerous, then argue that a human being who carries a gun for self defense is safe.\n \n I guess the police should all drop their weapons, huh? Can you explain why it is so dangerous for a person to use a gun to shoot a murderer while in the act, but it is much safer to call the police and wait for ANOTHER PERSON with a gun to shoot the murderer after the act?\n \n How is using an object in a safe manner to protect your life \"Chuck Norris\" or \"Rambo\"?

Remember that security guard that took that guy out at some church (can't remember the location?). Had she wanted she could have just ran away and hide like most people would have, instead she fought back and ended up killing a bad guy and saving lives. Schools, libraries, postal offices, etc are easy targets for those wanting to create massacres. Why? Because the laws are creating that environment. A lawful citizen knowing the law would NEVER take a gun with them to one of these places. Criminals know that and they know have the upper hand when they go to these places. Let's see them try that at a police station or shooting range. \n \n Chester, since CCW was made legal in several states the predictions of the Brady Campaign (streets will run red with blood, it would be like the ok corral, etc) has not happened.

You are correct that you don't just block a baseball bat. The correct technique is to step inside that swing.

I was referring to the one where the knife wielder was trying to save you from the guy behind you. And as I said, it proves nothing, much like the previous scenario. And just to show the power of word choice, no-one used the phrase 'charge at you', the phrase was 'running at you' which is much less emotive, and thus much less useful to your argument.\n \n \nWe should be examining many scenarios and seeing if having a gun helps or hinders the situation. \n\n Let's see...violent home invasion? Yes a gun would help the situation.\n\n Nope, if you pull a gun you're much more likely to get shot.\n \n \nAttempted raping in the parking lot? Yes a gun would help the situation.\n\n Nope, any struggling in that situation will just make the rapist restrain you more securely. The correct technique in that situation is the act as iff you have surrendered until he gets his tackle out, and then strike where it hurts.\n \nBeing stabbed in the grocery store? Yes a gun would help the situation.\n\n That depends whether you see your attacker coming or not. If you do see them coming, you should make sure of their intentions first (rather than just shooting them because they might be threatening. If you don't see them coming, then it's probably too late anyway, and a gun won't help you.\n \nRogue killer randomly firing on people simply because they're there. Yes a gun would help the situation.\n\n Maybe, unless of course, someone sees you firing your gun and believes you are the attacker, then you just get a nice little gun battle.

The courts will not be there at the time.\n \n \nHaving a gun makes the situation all that more serious because it makes it much easier to make unfixable mistakes.\n\n So does being unarmed. There's no coming back when you've been killed in a dark alley because you couldn't resist.\n\n I suggest you avoid dark alleys. That is the one of the first rules of self defense.\n \n \nI would not carry one, and I think a lot of people who do carry one shouldn't be allowed near one. \n\n Disarm the police then?\n\n What? Did any thought go into that response at all?\n \n \n\n So, how do we work out who can have one and who can't? \n The system currently in place works just fine for me.\n\n Yes, the current system is fine if you want a significantly higher gun mortality rate than anywhere else in the civilised world.",

   "Though I wouldn't particularly like to come up against someone with a base ball bat, I think my chances would be fair. You are correct that you don't just block a baseball bat. The correct technique is to step inside that swing. The fast moving end will break bones, but if you can step inside and block the slower moving and much lighter handle, then dis arming your opponent is much more possible.\n\n \n That's a well thought out answer, but how can you do something so logical and calculating in split second time? What if it's a machete instead of a baseball bat? What if there are two or more people to deal with at once?\n \n No matter how good you are, in today's world martial arts suck as a primary defensive option.\n \n \nYou are far more likely to make a bad situation worse if you try to be a hero.\n\n \n Evidence please. I'm not interested in second-hand opinion.\n \n \nThat is the advice the any sane policeman would give you. It's not stupid, it's common sense.\n\n \n That's funny, because every policeman I've talked to have said that they can't possibly be everywhere to protect everybody. They've advised getting a gun and learning how to use it to make up for the fact that there are only so many of them.\n \n Any sane policeman will tell you that if somebody has to die in a situation then they'd much rather it be the violent individual rather than the honest citizen.\n \n \nEr . . wrong scenario. I was referring to the one where the knife wielder was trying to save you from the guy behind you. And as I said, it proves nothing, much like the previous scenario. And just to show the power of word choice, no-one used the phrase 'charge at you', the phrase was 'running at you' which is much less emotive, and thus much less useful to your argument.\n\n \n I saw something like this on an urban legend show once...\n \n \nNope, if you pull a gun you're much more likely to get shot.\n\n \n If you're faced with a violent home entry, it's perfectly willing to assume that whoever broke in isn't wanting to ask about directions. Reasonable people don't kick down your front door. In a situation like that having a gun at your disposal will save your life.\n \n \nNope, any struggling in that situation will just make the rapist restrain you more securely. The correct technique in that situation is the act as iff you have surrendered until he gets his tackle out, and then strike where it hurts.\n\n \n Then don't wait until you're caught and pinned to the ground.\n \n \nThat depends whether you see your attacker coming or not. If you do see them coming, you should make sure of their intentions first (rather than just shooting them because they might be threatening. If you don't see them coming, then it's probably too late anyway, and a gun won't help you.\n\n \n Well if you see somebody pull a knife and just start randomly stabbing a shopper for no reason, I would certainly say that you've correctly determined their intentions and are well within your rights to shoot.\n \n \nMaybe, unless of course, someone sees you firing your gun and believes you are the attacker, then you just get a nice little gun battle. Things are much less likely to escalate if guns aren't involved.\n\n \n Evidence please. I want to see proof that what you see actually has occurred and isn't just simple fear mongering techniques used by those who promote the non-resistance idea as being the ultimate way of handling any and all bad situations.\n \n According to you and what you're saying, plainclothes detectives shouldn't be allowed to have guns because somebody might mistakenly believe that they're the shooter and kill them instead of the actual threat.\n \n \nNow you're just going to say that I think the lone gunman should be allowed to get away with it, but that isn't the case, just before you do.\n\n \n Oh sure, let the killer get away because any interference will make him madder and convince him to kill more than he originally intended. Good God what you speak of doesn't even qualify as Hollywood fiction.\n \n \nEr . . no. The courts decide what went on after the event. I am asking what happens when you start waving your gun. The courts will not be there at the time.\n\n \n Reasonable and intelligent people don't wave guns around with no regard for human life. Show me some statistics that would prove a significant percentage of those with concealed carry permits have been arrested for illegally brandishing their weapons in a threatening manner.\n \n \nI suggest you avoid dark alleys. That is the one of the first rules of self defense.\n\n \n There's no coming back from being killed anywhere. This isn't Marvel comics you know.\n \n \nWhat? Did any thought go into that response at all?\n\n \n You said that those who do carry guns shouldn't be allowed near them. Police carry guns, so you're saying the police should be disarmed.\n \n \nYes, the current system is fine if you want a significantly higher gun mortality rate than anywhere else in the civilised world.\n\n \n I think it all balances out when you take into account all the other violent mortality rates. Just because Germany has a lower firearms homicide rate than America, doesn't mean anything if they have a significantly higher knife homicide rate in comparison.",

What if there are two or more people to deal with at once?\n \n No matter how good you are, in today's world martial arts suck as a primary defensive option.\n\n In martial arts you are taught to do such logical things in the heat of the moment, by doing them over and over again. If it's a machete instead of a baseball bat, then the same stategy applies. Better to be either right up close to your opponent or a long way away than just far enough away to be within reach of the pointy end.\n \n And martial arts are a good first line of defense. They can't defend against everything, but then what can? And don't say a gun, because a gun can't defend against everything either.\n \n \nEvidence please. I'm not interested in second-hand opinion.\n\n Okay, this is just my opinion, but it makes sense to me that if the situation remains calm, then life is much less likely to be lost. Having said that second-hand opinion is all you have offered so far.\n \n \nThat's funny, because every policeman I've talked to have said that they can't possibly be everywhere to protect everybody. They've advised getting a gun and learning how to use it to make up for the fact that there are only so many of them.\n \n Any sane policeman will tell you that if somebody has to die in a situation then they'd much rather it be the violent individual rather than the honest citizen.\n\n I guess American cops have different opinions to everyone else then. But just for a nice little pointer on self-defense this website is on women's self-defense. The only time it mentions guns is to say\n \nBut what of the pepper spray in a women's purse? Don't be fooled. Carrying any personal security weapons like pepper spray, mace, knives or even guns in your purse can only give you a very false sense of security.\n \n First of all they are all concealed weapons, buried in a purse, or a pocket or even a glove compartment. You just won't have the time to find them to help yourself in dangerous situations.\n\n \n \nI saw something like this on an urban legend show once...\n\n And . . . ?\n \n \n \nIf you're faced with a violent home entry, it's perfectly willing to assume that whoever broke in isn't wanting to ask about directions. Reasonable people don't kick down your front door. In a situation like that having a gun at your disposal will save your life.\n\n Maybe, maybe not. It depends on so many variables that no-one seems to want to disguss. When is the break-in? Are you awake enough to know what is going on? Does the criminal have a gun? Where is your gun? Is he more experienced in using his gun than you (you can bet he is in most cases)? You seem to think that because your gun will protect you in one scenario, then they are good, but when scenarios are mentioned that a gun would be a bad thing, you just clam up, demand evidence (which you never provide of course) or throw insults.\n \n \nThen don't wait until you're caught and pinned to the ground.\n\n As the women's self-defense sight shows, more often than not you are only attacked if you are vulnerable, and not paying attention to your surroundings. So, it's be pinned to the floor, relax and wait for a good chance to attack (or struggle and be pinned more firmly), or behave in such a way as to be very unlikely to be attacked. Unless, of course, you want to shoot anyone you spot standing in the shadows.\n \n You may think that confronting people with a gun is good self-defense, and anyone who is not attacked after doing so would seem like evidence for your side (and there may even be statistics to show that this has saved x many people), but what if you walk around with confidence or avoid being alone in dark places and thereby avoid the situation altogether? You won't find any statistics on how many people avoid crime by being sensible.\n \n \nWell if you see somebody pull a knife and just start randomly stabbing a shopper for no reason, I would certainly say that you've correctly determined their intentions and are well within your rights to shoot.\n\n Congratulations on moving the goalposts for this one. Last time it was \"Being stabbed in the grocery store?\". Now it's if you \"see somebody pull a knife and just start randomly stabbing a shopper for no reason\". A gun won't help you in the first sceanrio, and anything like a tin of beans thrown at the attacker will probably help in the second.\n \n \nEvidence please. I want to see proof that what you see actually has occurred and isn't just simple fear mongering techniques used by those who promote the non-resistance idea as being the ultimate way of handling any and all bad situations.\n\n Okay, my opinion again, but you could equally say that about the original \"what if someone is running at you with a knife\" scenario.\n \n \nAccording to you and what you're saying, plainclothes detectives shouldn't be allowed to have guns because somebody might mistakenly believe that they're the shooter and kill them instead of the actual threat.\n\n I'm open-minded about trained, licenced individuals carrying guns. But if anyone can buy one, borrow one, find one, then you have a real problem.\n \n \nOh sure, let the killer get away because any interference will make him madder and convince him to kill more than he originally intended. Good God what you speak of doesn't even qualify as Hollywood fiction.\n\n Hang on a mo . . . this reminds of something . . . did I predict this?\n \n \nNow you're just going to say that I think the lone gunman should be allowed to get away with it, but that isn't the case, just before you do.\n\n Aaah, there you go! I did.\n \n Me thinks it is you who is going for the Hollywood fiction model here.\n \n \nReasonable and intelligent people don't wave guns around with no regard for human life. Show me some statistics that would prove a significant percentage of those with concealed carry permits have been arrested for illegally brandishing their weapons in a threatening manner.\n\n After proof again? Are you saying that everyone who has a gun, who feels like being a hero today, is a reasonable or intelligent person? Show me statistics that show that every person who gets a concealed carry permit is reasonable and intelligent.\n \n \nThere's no coming back from being killed anywhere. This isn't Marvel comics you know.\n\n There is a lot of violence in Marvel Comics. I am the one trying to lessen the amount of violence. I'm not so sure about you. You seem to think having the highest gun crime/gun suicide/violent crime figures in developed countries figures, (how did you put it?), works just fine for me.\n \n \nYou said that those who do carry guns shouldn't be allowed near them. Police carry guns, so you're saying the police should be disarmed.\n\n Where did I say that? Please quote me.\n \n \nI think it all balances out when you take into account all the other violent mortality rates. Just because Germany has a lower firearms homicide rate than America, doesn't mean anything if they have a significantly higher knife homicide rate in comparison.\n\n Ooh how shall I resond to this one? Any evidence of these higher knife homocide figures? Well, let me find it for you. This website is on knife crime.\n \n Here is paragraph nine\n \n \nAcross Latin America there were 36.4 homicides per 100,000 young people; Colombia topped the table with 84.4 killings per 100,000, followed by El Salvador and Brazil. Across Africa the average was 17.6 killings per 100,000 young people. In Russia it was 18 homicides per 100,000. In the USA the comparable figure was 11. And in Western Europe? France had just 0.6, Germany 0.8 and the UK only 0.9 killings for every 100,000 young people. \n\n \n Okay, that's just young people. Maybe you can find something less damning.",

   "Yeah, yeah. I've heard it all before, and you're not the first. But tell me, did your instructors teach you invincibility? Did they teach you enough that you could hold your own against a gang?\n\n Somehow I doubt you've heard it all before. But in answer to your questions. No, don't be stupid. And. Maybe a very small gang.\n \n \nTell me, comrade, do you think that there is not a single criminal alive who could beat you? Do you think you're ready to face all physical challenges no matter how intense? Could you beat superman in a fist fight? Are you made of Kryptonite? Could you slay a dragon? Unless the answer is \"yes\", maybe you should just keep your mouth shut for now. :)\n\n More questions.\n \n Answers\n Of course not, don't be stupid.\n Of course not, don't be stupid.\n Of course not, don't be stupid.\n Of course not, don't be stupid.\n Maybe, a very small one, if they existed.\n \n And a question for you\n \n Why shoud I keep my mouth shut?\n \n \nAlso, what do you say for the senior citizens? The old grandmas who use walkers? What about the sick? The young? The average? God created man, but Col. Colt made 'em equal.\n\n Find me a trained licenced grandma who can use her walker and quickly retrieve her gun and aim straight in under, let's say, 10 seconds and you might have a case.\n \n Another question for you.\n \n Did you really think before asking that one?\n \n \nThat it is. Likewise, thinking up a scenario to dismiss all possibilities of situations where an equalizer would come in handy isn't really that great either.\n\n So, you agree with me. That was my point.\n \n \nThat's true they don't. Stats do, though. And DC sure doesn't look like a peachy, crime-free place to me.\n\n And this is in answer to what?\n \n \nWell, we do live in an episode of Walker Texas Ranger, where criminals are cowardly bitches who will soil themselves and flee with their hands in the air once spotted. \n\n Then where is your problem?\n \n \nLife is just like a Brinks Home Security commercial, where a mean-looking thug will kick your door in, but run away once he hears the burglar alarm, huh?\n\n See no problem there either then. Whose side are you on?\n \n \nNo, I wouldn't shoot him. But looking funny and charging with a weapon are two very different things. Unless it's in the scenario that supports you. :) \n\n So, you agree that knowing someone's intentions when they are approaching you is not as easy as you would like to think.\n \n \nWhat if they're walking behind you and accelerate whenever you turn around? What if they don't have a knife? What if they don't have a gun? What if they're not nervous? What if you're not nervous? What's your state of mind? If you're waving your gun, what if someone else doesn't think you're the aggressor? Could the same happen with a knife or a fist? Who? What? When? Where? Why? How? \n \n All this hassle could be avoided if stopped asking questions and started giving answers.\n\n And I can show you the statistics for the rest of the developed world that show what terrible figures you have for every one of your states.\n \n \nI think the bigger question now is \"should we?\", not \"how should we?\" And from what I've seen, I'd give a big, fat no to answer that. Remarkable... after only one post, fact is suddenly coming in more handy than fiction, isn't it?\n\n Er . . I refer the right honourable gentleman to the answer I gave some moments ago.",

Ever? I think you're stretching the idea of impossibility here. Archie might agree with your mathematics on this one, though.\n \n But of course, you are carefully choosing a scenario that fits your beliefs and thinking it proves your point.

Unless you're suggesting that the background checks we have to go through are useless, and if they're useless then why do we bother keeping the system in place?\n\n It's strange how the argument is usually that criminals have no problem getting guns, so everyone should have one, but suddenly when it is pointed out that anyone can get one you seem to think that your system prevents this from happening. I do think that the background checks should be much more thorough, and any loopholes should be firmly closed, but then the pro-gun side would tend to argue against that.\n \n \nOnly a minute percentage of those who have a concealed carry permit ever have it revoked, suggesting that those who are legally armed and carrying aren't the public threat you make them out to be.\n\n Like you have done so many times, I asked for evidence/statistics. Do you see why I don't generally bother with those requests now?\n \n \nWell if that's true then how come you aren't supporting programs and laws that would be known criminals off of the streets and keeping them locked away where they can no longer break the law or pose a threat to innocent people? All I see out of you and your cohorts is \"gun control blah blah blah\", but you never talk about crime control, about getting criminals off the streets and out of society.\n\n Woe!!!!

I'm absolutely fine with keeping criminals off the streets if it works, if they are a threat to society, and if you're prepared to pay for their incarceration. I don't remember arguing otherwise. Perhaps you could correct me if I'm wrong.\n \n \nFind me another developed nation with a population size that's equal to America. In fact find me another developed nation that mirrors America in every way down to the minutest of details and differs ONLY in having stricter gun laws, and then we'll talk. Until then this \"other developed countries\" #### is irrelevant and not even worth considering.\n\n So, every other developed nation has less gun crime, less crime period, less criminals locked up etc etc and you want me to find an almost identicle nation (like Umerica) that is just a bit better off. Talk about wanting the impossible. It sounds like you don't want a solution to your problems. Oh yes, you said, \"The system currently in place works just fine for me.\"\n \n Why do you even bother coming here, if all is fine and dandy for you?\n \n Aah! So I said\n \n \n\"I would not carry one, and I think a lot of people who do carry one shouldn't be allowed near one.\"\n\n \n And you said\n \n \nYou said that those who do carry guns shouldn't be allowed near them. Police carry guns, so you're saying the police should be disarmed.\n\n \n Do you see how these differ? Your's suggests that I am saying everyone who carries a gun shouldn't be allowed near them. Which is wrong. Do you see that? Will you admit it?",

   "Somehow I doubt you've heard it all before. But in answer to your questions. No, don't be stupid. And. Maybe a very small gang.\n\n \n Face it. No matter how many Kung Fu movies you watch and no matter how tough you think you are, criminals will never just stand there and let you pound their head in. And there's always somebody tougher than you. You'd know if you ended up in a maximum security prison.\n \n \nMore questions.\n \n Answers\n Of course not, don't be stupid.\n Of course not, don't be stupid.\n Of course not, don't be stupid.\n Of course not, don't be stupid.\n Maybe, a very small one, if they existed.\n \n And a question for you\n \n Why shoud I keep my mouth shut?\n\n \n Because, as you just said, the answer to each question is no. Did you ever think of doing a head-on commercial? You might be good at it... :)\n \n \nFind me a trained licenced grandma who can use her walker and quickly retrieve her gun and aim straight in under, let's say, 10 seconds and you might have a case.\n \n Another question for you.\n \n Did you really think before asking that one?\n \n\n \n What about CCWs?\n \n So let's just get down to business:\n \n There are people who did not take 20 years of martial arts training.\n \n There are people who don't like Kung Fu movies.\n \n And there are people who criminals will fight against, rather than just stand there and let themselves get beat up. In fact, despite your holiness, I think you're one of them.\n \n And I feel I can be reasonably sure that the average civilian is no match for an average mugger. Muggers may not always be strong, they may not always be skilled. But if somebody is desperate enough to mug somebody, they can take a few bumps and bruises.\n \n \nAnd this is in answer to what?\n\n \n The entire gun question.\n \n \nThen where is your problem?\n \n \n See no problem there either then. Whose side are you on?\n\n \n Hilarious.\n \n \n \nAnd I can show you the statistics for the rest of the developed world that show what terrible figures you have for every one of your states.\n\n \n 1. Which are... ooh, Switzerland is such a utopia, and according to the stats you like to post, they've got pretty good crime rates. Did you do any reasearch on their gun laws? \n \n 2. Gun laws in the US are very diverse. You can be in one state where you don't even need a CCW to carry a firearm, where you can be in another state where they don't even permit people to own most kinds of shotguns and rifles. In fact, until Heller vs. DC, you couldn't even own a firearm in DC. It would be rather easy for a person to go to vermont, buy a firearm, then go south-a-ways to DC, Guns'a blazin', wouldn't it?\n \n 3. This is no excuse to dismiss the state stats, which apparently give some matter to answer \"2\".\n \n \nEr . . I refer the right honourable gentleman to the answer I gave some moments ago.\n\n \n So do I.",

   "Wise choice. But are you going to shoot everyone who looks like they might possibly be a threat to you?\n\n \n If I have sufficient reason to believe that they post a threat to me or others, then yes. If I'm in the wrong then it'll be settled in the courts and that'll be the end of it.\n \n \nYou do realise that most of them won't reveal their intentions until it is too late for you to reach your gun?\n\n \n I'll take my chances.\n \n \nAre you suggesting that the old and crippled will be able to retrieve a gun and aim accurately at short notice?\n\n \n I could provide news stories of such, but you'll likely just refer to them as anecdotal evidence and claim that they don't prove anything.\n \n Why have you provided no answer at all about how senior citizens and the disabled should defend themselves? You just treat them as if they don't exist or aren't worth your consideration. What's up with that? I ask you about how to protect the wellbeing of these targeted groups since your suggested method of defense can't possibly work for them, and instead you brush it off like the problem doesn't even exist.\n \n \nSo you are suggesting that people carry their guns in plain sight?\n\n \n No but it's logical to assume that your supplied site is suggesting it.\n \n \nBut these questions need to be answered before we can say whether a gun is a good thing or a bad thing, or just something that will never be used because it can't be reached when needed.\n\n \n No, we don't need to answer them. Somebody kicks in your door, you have no reason to assume that it was a simple mistake or they're just looking for directions because they're lost. Once force has entered the equation they become a hostile threat and you treat them as such, and you don't treat hostile threats with kid gloves or a purely intellectual approach like you would reasonable people.\n \n \nNot possible? Ever? I think you're stretching the idea of impossibility here. Archie might agree with your mathematics on this one, though.\n\n \n No, not possible in the least.\n \n \nBut of course, you are carefully choosing a scenario that fits your beliefs and thinking it proves your point. As I said before, obscure scenarios prove nothing.\n\n \n As are you.\n \n \nGet rid of the guns and you aren't going to have a one minute gun battle.\n\n \n Get rid of the cameras and you aren't going to have anymore child pornography either.\n \n Don't try the tired old \"if guns didn't exist...\" argument with me, it doesn't work.\n \n \nRubbish, a tin of mushroom soup to the head, ribs, arm or leg will work just fine. A bullet might hit it's target if you're trained well enough to cope with the tense fast moving situation, or it might kill the stabbee instead. Unless, of course you have evidence (not some one-off anecdote) to the contrary.\n\n \n No it's rubbish to believe that soup will solve such a problem. If that were the case then we'd be arming police with cans of soup to fight crime.\n \n \nI don't see any mention of rabid dogs before in this discussion.\n\n \n It's a comparison. In this case I'm comparing criminals to rabid animals, saying that we should treat both in the same manner; no discussions, no negotiations, just pure neutralizing force that doesn't stop until the threat is no longer present.\n \n \nIt's strange how the argument is usually that criminals have no problem getting guns, so everyone should have one, but suddenly when it is pointed out that anyone can get one you seem to think that your system prevents this from happening. I do think that the background checks should be much more thorough, and any loopholes should be firmly closed, but then the pro-gun side would tend to argue against that.\n\n \n How thorough do you want? Are we going to start denying sales over a matter of a single parking ticket? Or maybe advanced age will be a disqualifier? Or maybe you'd like to see people told that they can't own a gun because they've been divorced more than once in the last ten years.\n \n \nWoe!!!!

Oh yes, you said, \"The system currently in place works just fine for me.\"\n\n \n Just because there are stricter gun laws in one nation doesn't mean that's why there are fewer crimes committed with guns.

How long do you think it will take for this poor old dear to retrieve the gun from her handbag? Will she be able to handle the recoil, or will she break her other hip when she falls over? How easy do you think it would be for a criminal to walk up to her and grab said bag? One more gun in criminal hands. Oh wait, your dead right. It is easy for crminals to get guns, but you just seem to want to make it easier.\n \n \nNo but it's logical to assume that your supplied site is suggesting it.\n\n That sight is suggesting that you be aware of your surroundings and make it known that you can take care of yourself by use of a defensive weapon, not that you're a threat to anyone who comes within reach of your 'offensing' weapon.\n \n \nNo, we don't need to answer them.

If that were the case then we'd be arming police with cans of soup to fight crime.\n\n In the scenario you chose, a can of soup would work just as well as a gun.

In this case I'm comparing criminals to rabid animals, saying that we should treat both in the same manner; no discussions, no negotiations, just pure neutralizing force that doesn't stop until the threat is no longer present.\n\n So, you wish to be judge, jury and executioner when you see someone who you're 90% positive might be a threat to you or someone else?

Who deserves more consideration?\n \n \nSo, you do seem to be prepared to shoot first and ask questions later.\n\n \n I said no such thing, how did you come to that left field conclusion?\n \n \nSociety has a duty to protect its elderly and infirm.\n\n \n Just like the government supposedly has a duty to protect the citizens from harm?\n \n \nYou seem to be suggesting that giving some poor old dear, who can barely walk, a gun is going to be protection for her.\n\n \n No, I'm suggesting that if they're armed (that means in possession of a weapon AND has the knowledge of how to use it properly) they'll be less likely to suffer to the extent they would if they were left unarmed.\n \n \nHow long do you think it will take for this poor old dear to retrieve the gun from her handbag?\n\n \n A lot less than eight minutes, which is how long it'll take for the police to get there.\n \n \nWill she be able to handle the recoil, or will she break her other hip when she falls over?\n\n \n Well unless she's packing an elephant rifle I don't see such as being the case.

One more gun in criminal hands.\n\n \n In New York a woman in a wheelchair was on her way to a gun range when she was assaulted by a mugger who tried to drag her out of her wheelchair, so she drew her gun and shot him.\n \n \nThat sight is suggesting that you be aware of your surroundings and make it known that you can take care of yourself by use of a defensive weapon, not that you're a threat to anyone who comes within reach of your 'offensing' weapon.\n\n \n A firearm, especially a handgun, is a defensive weapon. Regardless of how it might be used, a handgun is purely defensive in nature compared to other types of weapons. Just because you beat someone over the head with a shield doesn't mean it's an offensive implement.\n \n \nYou don't tackle a hardened criminal head on. It's just plain stupid to think you have the upper hand just because you have a gun.\n\n \n The recommended practice is to let them come after you, and deal with them once they get to your safe room. But then again there are always exceptions to the recommended practice, you might have family in other parts of the house and fear for their safety so you'll have to venture out to look for the threat.\n \n \nBut my intention is to show that carefully chosen scenarios prove nothing. I'm sure I mentioned that somewhere before. You are under the mistaken impression that they somehow prove your point.\n\n \n You've selected carefully chosen scenarios to try and prove your points, but that hasn't worked for you either. So what say we stop all this rhetoric and you give up all those asinine arguments that the anti-gunners have used in the past, and we'll move on from there.\n \n \nA camera is not a deadly weapon.\n\n \n Doesn't have to be to exploit children. The old \"That's different, a gun is meant for killing, blah blah blah isn't!\" argument isn't going to work either.\n \n \nAnd I already know that no argument will work with you because you think that your national crime statistics are just fine and dandy.\n\n \n Well since nobody has suggested anything that could effectively and reliably lower national crime statistics, you have two options: you can either bitch and moan and whine about it, or you can suck it up and move on.\n \n \nIn the scenario you chose, a can of soup would work just as well as a gun. It would be a weighty weapon with a range greater than that of the knife your target is carrying, and you would have plenty of ammo. Attempting to extrapolate this to arming police with such a weapon is just idiotic.\n\n \n And how do you propose getting past the accuracy issue with a can of soup? A can of soup is hardly aerodynamic in design, it's not accurate when you throw it, you have no control over what trajectory is takes, etc. that's why muskets were replaced with rifles for single projectiles.\n \n \nSo, you wish to be judge, jury and executioner when you see someone who you're 90% positive might be a threat to you or someone else? How about 85%? I'm sure the courts will be singing your praises all over town.\n\n \n Everyday cops have to make split-second decisions going on just about no information at all -they see somebody going for something in their wallet but don't know what it is, what are they supposed to do- and sometimes mistakes will happen, sometimes they'll kill somebody who was simply pulling out a wallet. That's just how the world works, sometimes things are gonna go wrong, somebody innocent is going to die, and there are going to be consequences afterward. \n \n \nWhat crime control do you have in mind? And don't suggest shooting on sight as a reasonable measure.\n\n \n Felon in possession of a firearm, mandatory five years in prison without a single day of parole until the time is served. Trafficking firearms, ten years for each every gun bought under false pretenses, and another five for each that was sold to a prohibited individual; all served in a consecutive manner rather than concurrently. Repeat offenders and career criminals, double what they got the last time for their previous crime.\n \n If people don't want to change and just insist on continually reoffending then I fail to see why they should be offered anymore chances.\n \n \nSo, now you're suggesting that any nation that has lower crime statistics that the US is cheating? Try looking at the variables before you just assume the worst. It is probably true that some of them have tougher gun regulations. Some allow guns, some don't. One in particular has every able bodied male in the national military (lots of guns there).\n\n \n Japan, which supposedly has next to no gun crime, is a police state run by a dictatorship. The police have the authority to do whatever they want, including the use of physical torture to generate a confession from a suspect.\n \n \nI think you'll find that most of said nations don't tap their citizens' phone lines without warrant, don't check which books you borrow from the library etc etc etc. Don't just assume you are 'freer' than everyone else, because you aren't.\n\n \n Well then you think wrong.",
