   "  I think I already won \nPowerful opponents of eco-terrorism are mounting the nation's most formidable campaign against the homegrown sabotage. But the crime wave they hope to quell -- a 21/2-year escalation of arsons and property destruction -- subsided last summer, perhaps due to law enforcement crackdowns.\n \n A congressional subcommittee held a hearing on eco-terrorism last month in which lawmakers, keyed up about terrorists since the Sept. 11 attacks, likened America's green underground to al-Qaida. An FBI official testified that the Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front had become the nation's most active and destructive domestic terrorist groups.\n\n   Radio Towers Bulldozed by Eco-Terrorists\n Tuesday September 8, 2009 \n It appears two radio towers in Everett, Washington were toppled by an eco-terrorist group. A neighbor who called 911 told the dispatcher someone attacked the towers with a bulldozer.\n \n According to breitbart.com: \"A sign bearing the letters ELF was found near the towers, said Andy Skotdal, general manager of KRKO Radio in Everett, about 25 miles north of Seattle. The Earth Liberation Front is a loose collection of radical environmentalists that has claimed responsibility for dozens of attacks since the 1990s.\"\n",

But there are plenty of nuts like that on the left as well.\n \n A Texas woman faces trial this month in Austin on charges she threatened to kill a government informant who infiltrated an Austin-based group that planned to bomb the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., last fall.\n \n Katyanne Marie Kibby, 25, was indicted in June by a federal grand jury in Austin. She is accused of retaliating against Brandon Darby, the community activist-turned-informant who helped federal prosecutors win convictions against Bradley Neal Crowder, 24, and David Guy McKay, 23.\n \n Prosecutors say the e-mail threat was made Jan. 10. That was two days after Crowder reached a plea bargain with federal prosecutors in Minneapolis for his role in the plot to build Molotov cocktails and attack the GOP convention in September 2008.\n \n Crowder and McKay were part of a group of activists that had gone to the Twin Cities to take part in street demonstrations. The FBI had infiltrated the group with Darby. Crowder and McKay built eight of the gasoline firebombs but didn't use them, a fact law enforcement officials credited to Darby.\n \n Members of the Austin protest community heaped scorn on Darby, saying he had betrayed longtime friends and colleagues.\n \n Kibby, who lives in Houston, is free on bond. If convicted, she could face 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. She could not be reached for comment.\n \n What's funny is that, even as this is going on, the left is all atwitter about some gun owners legally carrying their firearms to tea parties in accordance with their 2nd amendment rights. You hear about that endlessly on news outlets like MSNBC, but I'll bet Kibby's name has never been mentioned on the network. Not to mention Crowder's name or McKay's.\n \n As far as I'm concerned, violence has no place in American politics right now. I firmly believe that we citizens should embrace our 2nd amendment rights as they were enshrined in the Constitution against a day when, as Thomas Jefferson put it, the \"tree of liberty\" will need to be replenished once again by the blood of \"patriots and tyrants.\" But that time is certainly not now.\n \n And people who plan on firebombing political conventions, or those who beat down peaceful protesters in the streets (I'm looking at you, SEIU) are tyrants. Not patriots.\"",

The Spokane County Sheriff's Office launched a helicopter on Friday in the search, and the public was urged to call 911 if Paul is spotted.\n \n \"He is in a bad mental state,\" his brother, Tom Paul, told The Associated Press. \"Why would they load him on a bus and take him to a fair?\"\n \"Why was he allowed to take such a trip?\" Gov. Chris Gregoire said Friday. \"Why did they go to a location that was so heavily populated with families?\"\n \n Thirty-one patients from the mental hospital were on the trip with 11 staff members. Patients must be cleared by a treatment team before they can go on trips to stores, parks, ball games, fairs and other sites, said hospital spokesman Jim Stevenson. They wear street clothing and need not all stay together, but staff members are required to keep each patient within eyesight at all times.\n\n \n Some folks will never get it!!
