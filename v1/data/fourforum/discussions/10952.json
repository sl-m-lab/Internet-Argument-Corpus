   "This is yet another attempt to address what I think would be a very good topic. This concerns the subject of logical fallacies and how they apply to written debate. I asked basic questions about logical fallacies in a thread someone else started in the \"debating techniques and styles\" room that was deleted. I don't think the questions I asked were inflammatory at all. Asking where fallacies originated, who originated them, and what their application and purpose was at the time they were started are legitimate questions. \n \n The best I can tell so far (and I'm willing to concede points and learn) is that they originated a few decades ago, and they were formed around spoken debate, between two people behind podiums, before an audience. Usually in universities, or in video media politics. It looks like fallacies originated without knowledge of or application to written debate. The best I can tell, written debate on the internet has increased greatly in just the last 5 years or so. It wasn't going on much on the comparatively young internet only 10 years ago. Without the internet, was there really any such thing as written debate? It wasn't like it was commonplace for people to mail their opinions back and fourth by the US postal service, was it? \n \n I think there are some profound differences between spoken debate and written debate, and one would be differences in how an audience would perceive them. Yet I see no evidence that anyone has attempted to form fallacy lists with a specific application of written debate in mind, either free-for-all open debates like most are here, or the structured \"debate tournaments\" we sometimes have. \n \n From the deleted thread, I remember isly ilwott using one word to describe what fallacies are; deceptive. I think that's a very good one word description. And I think there are many, many ways that deception can happen in written debate that can't happen in spoken debate, and vice versa. \n \n These are written debate forums, there are many other written debate forums. If no one has yet shown some basic definitions in how fallacies should be addressed in written debate, isn't it time to get started? \n \n I've been asked by the moderator to keep this out of the formal debate rooms, and that's too bad since that where it really belongs. It's not the moderators fault, however. I'll try it here and hope it doesn't get nasty - there's no reason for it to. I'll immediately report trolling on this thread, and I've asked the moderator to keep an eye on it too.",

   "More from the troll description thread in post #4;\n \n \n \nWhy does it Matter?\n \n Some people -- particularly those who have been online for years -- are not upset by trolls and consider them an inevitable hazard of using the net. As the saying goes, \"You can't have a picnic without ants.\"\n \n It would be nice if everybody was so easy-going, but the sad fact is that trolls do discourage people. Established posters may leave a message board because of the arguments that trolls ignite, and lurkers (people who read but do not post) may decide that they do not want to expose themselves to abuse and thus never get involved.\n \n Another problem is that the negative emotions stirred up by trolls leak over into other discussions. Normally affable people can become bitter after reading an angry interchange between a troll and his victims, and this can poison previously friendly interactions between long-time users.\n \n Finally, trolls create a paranoid environment, such that a casual criticism by a new arrival can elicit a ferocious and inappropriate backlash.\n \n The Internet is a wonderful resource which is breaking down barriers and stripping away prejudice. Trolls threaten our continued enjoyment of this beautiful forum for ideas. \n\n \n Is this wrong - are trolls not a problem? \n \n Why don't trolls get reigned in by fallacy applications?

But there's good reason the writer of my link referred to written debate as a \"beautiful forum for ideas.\" Written debate takes the hindrance of the name and face away, and it takes away the hindrance of quick wit, which doesn't always equal intelligence.

No one seems to know where or why or by whom oral fallacies originated, or what specific problem they were addressing. \n\n \n We already addressed that. The NAME of fallacies came about from formal debate. The usage of them did not. Bad logic produced them. And you made the assertion that there are only oral and only written fallacies. No one else did. \n \n \nTrolls can intentionally use fallacies to discourage people in ways that can't happen in a spoken debate.\n\n \n Obviously you don't understand what trolling is. Can you give an example of this?\n \n \nArgument by fast talking, changing the subject, personal charm, argument by question - these are mainly about spoken debate, yet can happen in written debate in such a different way that they don't seem to be easily recognized.\n\n \n Wrong. Changing the subject is seen all of the time. AA just tried to change the subject during a debate on Stagflation away from how Reagan extended it to how Carter allegedly started it. That's changing the subject. I caught it and he ran away. Fast talking in the form of the Glish Glop is regularly seen on debate forums, primarily by creationists who throw out arguments in large numbers to see if one sticks, as many of them fail, they quickly move on to more arguments. That is the essences of fast talking with an addition of changing the subject. Fast talking's point is to confuse the audience. This can be done non-fallaciously as well with any technical subject. Finance comes to mind. \n \n Personal charm may be the only one that doesn't apply to a written debate where the users do not personally know each other. \n \n \nFor example, argument by oral fast talking could be the same as multiple posters piling on new posts every few minutes, as their one lone opponent is trying to answer just one of them.\n\n \n That's not fast talking. Please learn your fallacies. Fast talking is meant to confuse the audience and the opponent by complicated and quick changes. Simply because people are posting large numbers does not mean you can't stop and read them. In oral debate, you simply do not have the time to do that as oral debates are largely formal and have strict rules on time allocation. Written debates, such as this site, have no such rule. There is nothing stopping the minority from reading each post at their leisure. This issue was brought up in the numbers thread and you never dealt with it. \n \n \nPersonal charm could be involved when members of a multiple posting gang are having a love fest among themselves. Could be very influential to an passerby reader.\n\n \n Only if you personally know the user. And you seem to be deliberately avoiding again the issue of how the arguments prove who is right, not the numbers. The numbers thread went pointless because you simply refused to debate the argument you made.\n \n \nA troll can take only a few fallacies and multiply them to an extent that really fouls up a message board, far more than an oral debator could foul up one oral debate, let alone a series of them.\n\n \n In what manner? How? Do you have examples or are you pulling this argument out of your ***?\n \n \nOne oral debate can't really \"leak over into other discussions\" the way written debates can and do.

AA has used numerous personal attacks and needling and no one who disagrees with him is paranoid.

The contributions can and should be assessed on their own merits - are they themselves fallacious? \n\n \n Often they are - they have fallacious content. The \"assessment\" of it is often part of the discussion. If there were no free-for-all assessment of fallacies during the discussion, then I would possibly agree that content is all that would matter. What happens all too often, is that if one poster is making logical sense against many posters of an opposing opinion, they (the many posters) often start accusations of fallacies by the one poster, without policing themselves on their own fallacies. Remember, fallacies are about deception. Several people working together can deceive without being called on it easier than one poster can without being called on it. \n \n A political subject, or any type of worldview clash, is a completely different subject than fallacy application. If 10 posters are opposing one poster, and only one of the group of 10 is committing fallacies, our experiences on these forums show that the other 9 are not going to call him on them. It's more important to them to make their points about the subject than distance themselves from a fallacy using poster who agrees with them. \n \n For example the questions for both sides thread. I was opposed by several - my first post was #10, a non aggressive post. Most of the immediately following posters weren't directly doing anything objectionable. One or two of them were - electrolyte was trolling it, committing fallacies, trying to get me to stop posting. (see post #12 - notice the ad hominem, needling etc.) You won't notice any of the others saying \"hold the phone, stop the presses, electrolyte is committing fallacies, and I don't want to be confused with him in any way\". They don't police him on it, because making their points, possibly getting me to stop posting, is more important to them than proper debate. If the lone poster attempts to call him on it, with no other backing, he is then subject to several taunts about trying to change the subject. When one poster is focusing on defending his position against the multiple thought processes of a group, while being completely sidetracked in a fallacy discussion, surely you can imagine how discouraging it can be for the one poster. I hope you'll check that thread out, and pay particular attention to my post #77. \n \n \nIf not, then why should lots of them add up to a fallacy?

And who exactly is supposed to be committing this fallacy anyway? \n\n \n Most all of these discussions are about worldviews, very complex, not something as simple as 2+2=4. \n \n \nSecondly, free-for all discussions are not debates. 1-on-1 challenges and formal debates are, and they are not susceptible to this phenomenon. \n\n \n I agree, and that leads me to a very important question. There are plenty of examples on these forums of one poster abandoning a free-for-all discussion, and getting taunts about \"running way\", about being unable to deal with a particular subject. If you check the last post of the above referenced \"questions for both sides\" thread, you'll see it happened to me. Why can't these taunts be considered a fallacy? If you agree that they are fallacious, then they need an official name, don't they? Why don't we call it the \"free for all fallacy\"? It wouldn't be any more ridiculous than the \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy, would it? \n \n \nFallacies, in my opinion, refer to deceptive - or just as often, incompetent and ill-considered - arguments made in the context of a debate. In a free-for-all it is up to the observer to recognise that he is not watching a debate and adjust his expectations accordingly.\n\n \n I agree with that 100%, but they aren't always perceived that way. I don't think the passerby readers here always see that, and I don't believe many other posters here agree with you and I on it. \n \n If observers are expected to recognize what is, or is not actually a debate, can't we trust an observer to also recognize what is fallacious in an argument, without providing lists and applications of fallacies? Put another way, if we provide observers with lists and applications of fallacies for proper debate, shouldn't there be lists and applications of fallacies custom made for these free-for-all discussions? I'm not saying there shouldn't be 5 against 1 or 10 against 1 discussions - I enjoyed the \"questions for both sides\" one. But doesn't the lone poster need some relief from the snowballing, other than just abandoning the thread and then getting taunted for it?",

   "Peeling, you miss a key definition.\n \n Similar in how Marc9000 defined liberal/atheist to mean whoever he disagrees with, he considers the word \"fallacy\" to mean any argument that refutes him. Notice in his post he doesn't actually show how the majority argument is fallacious, he just claims that they use fallacies because they are the majority. If you read his alleged 'evidence' it is quite obvious that he defines fallacies to mean \"any opposing arguments.\"",

   "What happens all too often, is that if one poster is making logical sense against many posters of an opposing opinion, they (the many posters) often start accusations of fallacies by the one poster, without policing themselves on their own fallacies.\n\n Hmm.\n \n The problem I have with this is that there's a strong bias to your depiction of these circumstances: the plucky 'one poster' making logical sense and having accusations of fallacious reasoning hurled at him by the mob. Just as it would be fallacious to assume that he is outnumbered because he is wrong, it's fallacious to assume he is outnumbered because he is right.\n \n What if the one poster is wrong, and those opposing him are correct to point out his fallacies?\n \nIf 10 posters are opposing one poster, and only one of the group of 10 is committing fallacies, our experiences on these forums show that the other 9 are not going to call him on them.\n\n Absolutely. And I've seen that on all sides of every debate. There are, for instance, creationists and 'evolutionists' (shudder) of varying sophistication and the more experienced tend to keep quiet while the others are holding court.\n \n At the end of the day, it's nobody else's job to make your argument for you.\n \nFor example the questions for both sides thread. I was opposed by several - my first post was #10, a non aggressive post. Most of the immediately following posters weren't directly doing anything objectionable. One or two of them were - electrolyte was trolling it, committing fallacies, trying to get me to stop posting. (see post #12 - notice the ad hominem, needling etc.)\n\n At which point you have an excellent opportunity to decide what you want to get out of this gift E. has dumped in your lap. \n \nYou won't notice any of the others saying \"hold the phone, stop the presses, electrolyte is committing fallacies, and I don't want to be confused with him in any way\".\n\n Nor would I expect them to. They are not responsible for his actions and unless they believe he is materially damaging their own objectives, it's not their job. \n \nMost all of these discussions are about worldviews, very complex, not something as simple as 2+2=4.\n\n Actually, most of the ones I've partaken of aren't about worldviews as such: rather, they're about worldview informing rationality vs rationality informing worldview. Most of the emotional friction, in my opinion, arises from both sides projecting onto the other. You seem to believe 'evolutionists' must to a man want life to have developed via naturalistic processes in order to accept the conclusion that it has, and 'evolutionists' often appear to believe your rationality must be impaired. Since neither is actually true, not a lot of headway is made towards forging a mutual understanding.\n \nI agree, and that leads me to a very important question. There are plenty of examples on these forums of one poster abandoning a free-for-all discussion, and getting taunts about \"running way\", about being unable to deal with a particular subject. \n\n Do the taunts mean he isn't running away, or that he is able to deal with the subject?\n \nWhy can't these taunts be considered a fallacy?\n\n Because in any one particular instance they might be correct.\n \nIf you agree that they are fallacious, then they need an official name, don't they? Why don't we call it the \"free for all fallacy\"? It wouldn't be any more ridiculous than the \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy, would it?\n\n The problem is, you're trying to say that such behaviour is fallacious irrespective of what the opposition has said or done. Everything you've said here so far is predicated on the assumption that the 'one poster' can do no wrong. It's ok, for instance, to say \"No true X would Y\" if the accepted definition of X already excludes Y. The no true Scotsman fallacy comes into play if the claimant is attempting to redefine X to exclude Y; he's hoping the audience will agree with his more exclusive definition of X without having to actually justify it.\n \nBut doesn't the lone poster need some relief from the snowballing, other than just abandoning the thread and then getting taunted for it?\n\n If that's what you find yourself doing, stop doing it. Explain politely that your time is limited and that you are already overcommitted responding to just one or two posters. Anyone trying to butt in will be reduced to heckling from the sidelines, which makes them look bad.",

   "Fallacies have pretty much always been a part of debate regardless of format.\n As such look for debates, Parliament has been around since the Norman Conquest which uses a system of written questions and answers. I'm sure you could find fallacious arguments in the Roman Fora and almost certainly Athens.
