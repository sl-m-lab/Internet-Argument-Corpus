   "Reason is based upon ideas that are said to be true only because ideas contrary to them are beyond human comprehension. For example - reason mandates that something can not be and not be in the same place at the same time (A & -A can not be true). There is no further reason to say that this is nessisarly the case though, exsept that one can not fathom the contrary. However, it is necessary that things exist that are beyond human comprehention. The size of the universe, for example: If it is infinite then my finite mind can not fathom what it contains. On the other hand, if it is Finite in size, then I can not comprehend the nothingness beyond it either, how could it exist in no space? What would its shape be if there is no outside to look at it from? or if it is some third opotion that is neither fininte nor infinite - how could that be?\n \n how do you folks who are so keen on your absolute \"logic\" and \"reason\" deal with this dilema?",

   "Kant was a 17th century philosopher who was incredibly important and influential. \n \n You are probably familiar with Descartes' Cogito: I think therefore I am. This was the result of a system of doubt indented to find an absolutely true basis from witch to build an understanding of the world. That came from the second of six \"mediations\" in Descartes important work \"Meditations on first philosophy.\" In the first meditation he doubted everything he could, based on the idea that his senses could be deceiving him, or that an evil god could be tricking him. The Cogito was all that was left, all he could know was that he existed. You don't here much about the rest of the meditations, because he was not entirely rational about how he went about reconstructing the world beyond himself. What he did was Define god into existence, similarly to the way St. Anselm did, by asserting that Gods own definition necessitates his existence. This is circular and doesn't make any sense, and then furthermore he asserted that god is good by definition, and that therefore there couldn't be an evil god tricking him.\n \n Later on, a philosopher named Hume didn't buy the last few meditations, as many didn't, and sought out to doubt the world in a more complete and rational manner. What Hume came up with in the end was that the only things that could be known were sense perceptions in the moment that they were experienced. Claiming that even things believed to be as certain as cause and effect were only assumptions made based on their persistence. This means that, for example, just because every time in the past that I have walked out my front door I have ended up outside, that doesn't necessarily mean that next time I walk out my front door I wont find myself back inside. Consequently, Hume abandoned philosophy, and took up history instead.\n \n Following Hume was Kant, who, recognizing that this idea reveled the necessary separation of the human mind from reality - sought out to recognize what the relationship between the mind and reality was. Prior to Kant philosophy had been about absolute objective truth, witch Socrates had died for. Kant recognized that we don't have any objective connection to reality, all we have is our own subjective perception of reality. Kant divided the world into two parts the \"Phenomenal world\" and the \"Nominal world\" where the Nominal world was the world in itself (witch may or may not exist) and the Phenomenal world was the world we know.\n \n Given that idea, things that are incomprehensible would necessarily be part of the \"Nominal world\" and, as you point out, DrNo, reason can only be applied to the \"Phenomenal world\" as reason is within our own mind.\n \n This is an important realization - and it is the reason I asked this question. It is a common mistake for people to talk about reason as though it is something absolute and objective, when in reality it is merely a system that is applied to subjective perceptions. When two people have contradicting points of view on something - whether conception Is the beginning of life or not, for example - its often essentially because their intuitive subjective perception Is just different. Consequently, it feels plain and obvious to both sides, and so to appeal to the authority of Logic at this point is by claiming that your side is just more logical is to equate logical with obvious. And that doesn't make sense, because the obvious can vary from person to person",
