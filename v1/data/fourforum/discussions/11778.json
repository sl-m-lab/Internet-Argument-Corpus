   "There is no need for FASB to suspend it and, in fact, mark to market (aka fair value) actually has been proven to show the most realistic price of investments. \n \n I personally think Fair valuing is not a good idea but not for the reasons given by those in favor of suspending the rule now (it is not suspended right now by the way). These same people were arguing for the accounting rule as it made their companies look good but now that times are tough they want to get rid of it. \n \n In the end, the accounting rule doesn't make a damn bit of difference. Anyone who relies on the financial statements will be smart enough to know the accounting rules used and thus will take that into account. The Cash Flow statement is really what you look at and these companies complaining about this have no cash flow. \n \n I can get more in-depth if you like but in short: It caused nothing and has done no damage.",
