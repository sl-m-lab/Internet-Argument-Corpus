What does everyone think?\n\n \n Unsure of what you have already done this is a difficult question to answer. Certainly your books make for excellent reading. I wonder though if you remove yourself too far from the world in which we live. It is important to be focused on God but to also recognize people and places and cultures. Jesus himself hungout with the lonely, the lost, the tax gatherers. Is there a people group that draws you at the level of your emotions? What about them is it that draws you? What emotions do you have and why concerning them? These are the questions to ask yourself if you are developing a curriculum for social studies. \n \n eg: You are drawn to people with drug addictions. It might be useful to study something akin to a twelve step program or even the cultural norms of the inner city. Consider them from a Christian perspective if you like. There are many good books out there. Philip Yancey has a book called \"What's So Amazing About Grace?\" that is a fine social studies book. If you are drawn as a missionary to a muslim people group get a text on them. Antioch Network has a gala of books on people Groups.\n \n My suggestions only and only food for thought.",
