At least I have no memory as I write this that he was black. As to your point about reverse discrimination existing in this Country, that is a no brainer. Blacks can make totally racist statements with immunity where as whites are held to a much higher standard based on white guilt and political correctness.\n \n The congressional black caucus comes to mind which is a group of black Congressmen who have a club in DC. When a white Congressman asked to join, he was told in no uncertain terms to forget it. If the situation was reversed and ANY white organization, especially one in our Government refused a black from joining a white club, the National outrage would have been deafening.",

   "EXACTLY, when MOST of us, especially whites, look at that video, we DON'T see race...we see jerks. The vast majority of Blacks look at everything through the prism of race, therefore any perceived wrong or disrespect shown to them automatically becomes motivated by hate and race. Sadly, most Blacks will not engage in a rational discussion of these issues. They feel they are the only ones entitled to feel anger and mock Whites for feeling the same anger, or at the very least not acknowledging a clear double standard.\n \n Most don't remember this, not a major incident, but a Black kid in elemenatyary school was handcuffed by the Tampa police a year or 2 ago, and Sharpton et al came out denouncing the police (justifiably so), even stating that NO child should be handcuffed like that. I recall a case during the Schiavo case when a kid was handcuffed for trying to bring her water....NO SHARPTON, no anybody\n \n I believe it was Shelby Steele (a Black man by the way) who recently wrote a book in which he theorized that it was actually the fault of Whites for the behaior and reactions of Blacks in todays society, something I happen to agree with completely. He noted that prior to the 60's, when Blacks TRULY suffered injustices, there were no riots, not as much Black crime, etc. Then came the 60's with sissy wimpy Whites (my words) giving excuses for bad behavior, something which has gotten worse over the years. Any responsible parent would correct a child's bad behavior to let them know that behavior is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. What do Whites do? We give a hug, slap them on the wrist (IF that) and tell them how much we understand their anger. And yes, when they are accorded the special privileges and rights that other races do NOT receive, this exacerbates the problem, giving them a sense of \"we can do whatever we want and you can't stop us\" type of attitude.",

All of the civil rights movement was the 60s, and its most powerful leader was a peaceful man. \n \n \nWhites have allowed Blacks to behave in this way...hey, read Steele (I haven't yet but plan on it)\n\n \n There is everything wrong with this sentence.[*]You are trusting a source, you yourself have not read.[*]Not all the people who fought for civil rights were black.[*]It assumes whites as some kind of authority figure that the blacks have to seek permission from.[*]You are missing punctuation.\n \nFrankly, because people have been so brainwashed by Political Correctness, I don't believe a word anyone says in public...everyone wants to appear so tolerant and enlightened, but guarandamntee you in most cases it's different in their home. I put less on words than I do actions.\n\n \n Even though I disagree with what you are saying here - this does not even address what I said. Especially the part where you can determine what a group of individuals thinks as each individual is likley to have their own thoughts.\n \n \nMY GOD, someone pinch me...did you just make a generalization about generalizing? LMAO\n\n \n Yes, I did that on purpose. It was a play on something Mark Twain said. An attempt at humor. Glad you got it. \n \n \nWell, I'm sorry that I haven't been able to overcome my instinct of self preservation like YOU\n\n \n I don't need to demonize groups of people to have a sense of self-preservation. I am sorry if you find threat in things that don't look like what you see in the mirror, but that is your misfortune.\n \n \n...If I see a bear in the freaking woods, I'm gonna run..I guess YOU would say \"this bear hasn't attacked ME and I haven't seen him attack anyone, so I'll give him a chance\" LOL GEEEEEEEEEZ, it's the most natural thing in the world to generalize based on any number of things, including race...\n\n \n Sure. Its natural and its easy. It actually takes courage to bother with actualities rather than generalizations.\n \n By the way, have you actually ever seen a bear in the woods? There are bunches of them up by my cabin. Usually, they will run away from you. They tend to only attack when they feel threatened. A little bit knowledge can go a long way.\n \n \nI never said it's entirely accurate on an individual basis, it just gives me reason to be suspicious and not trust completely is all...how in God's name is that so wrong? \n\n \n The fact that you don't know the answer to this is very telling.\n \n \nthank you for the advice...but I would say to you, don't ignore the facts as they are and spin those facts to suit your belief.\n\n \n You speak as though I have no life experience or education on the matter. Not sharing your automatic distrust or low opinion of black people is not a spin. Its me thinking you are wrong.\n \n \nI beg to differ...I think, much as teenagers succumb to peer pressure and live their lives by what others think of them, I think it would kill you for others to think you are \"closed-minded\" like me :-P\n\n \n Lets see, we are talking about me here. I told you what I actually feel and what do you do? Resort to an invented generalization of \"people like me\" (whatever that is). Like I said before, it actually takes courage to bother with actualities rather than gernalizations.\n \n \nFirst, let's make note for the record that you called me childish (not to mention arrogant)first, so please don't try to use that against me should I come back with the same, deal? \n\n \n Fine, but I feel I should correct you. I called your ideas about race childish and said that you were arrogant. \n \n \nHaving said that, this sounds like my 15 year old \"you don't know me, what I think\" blah blah blah\n\n \n The difference between me and your 15 your old is that you actually don't know me or what I think.\n \n \nAnyway, can you explain why other races (Hispanic, Oriental, etc.) are not discriminated against as much as Blacks? \n\n \n Hate to be too PC on ya, but using the word \"oriental\" in regards to people, is offensive. The word you are looking for is \"Asian\". Asians include people's whose heritage is Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, Cambodian, Phillipino and Indian (not an inclusive list).\n \n \nI mean, IF there is so much racism as many say there is, why isn't it against other races as well? We sure don't hear about it much if there is, DO we? \n\n \n Once again, speak for yourself. There have been civil rights movements and leaders that were Jewish, Black, Latino, Asian, Native American and even White. Ever heard of Cesar Chavez? Maybe before shooting your mouth off on this issue you should educate yourself on it first?\n \n \nAfterall, a racist does not pick and choose who he wants to hate, right? \n\n \n Generally racism is taught - by parenting, society, sometimes government (Nazi Germany) or even a negative personal experience.\n \n \nSo, why do we hear SO much about racism from Blacks?\n\n \n First of all, quite saying \"we\" when you mean \"I\". I believe you are disproportionately focused on them due to what I believe are your personal issues with blacks. Secondly, they are the largest minority group in the US right now (although that will be shifting to Latinos in the immediate or near future).",
