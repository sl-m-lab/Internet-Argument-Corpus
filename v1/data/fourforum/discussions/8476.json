   "How is this not reversing a judicial decision? I wonder how far this is going to go seeing how the polls show that a majority in Mass. is in support of same sex marriage. The anti-gay side feels confident that they have the 50 votes to approve this. \n \n http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2174266&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312\n \n \n \nThe same court that made Massachusetts the first state to legalize gay marriage ruled Monday that a proposed constitutional amendment to ban future same-sex marriages can be placed on the ballot, if approved by the Legislature. \n \n Justice John M. Greaney, in a concurring opinion, warned that approving an amendment banning gay marriage would be discriminatory because it would remove the rights of same-sex couples to the legal, social and financial benefits of marriage.\n",

   "How is this not reversing a judicial decesion?\n\n Reversing a decision would occur at what you might call the \"law\" level. Amending the Constitution is at a different level, and so doesn't count as a reversal.\n \n \n\n I wonder how far this is going to go seeing how the polls show that a majority in Mass. is in support of same sex marriage. The anti-gay side feels confident that they have the 50 votes to approve this. \n \n\n They only need 1/4 of the legislature, so they'll probably get that. But if it actually gets to the polls? The conservatives took a big hit when they ran around screaming \"If gays get married society will collapse and we'll all be doomed!!!11!1!!\" and then nothing happened. And of course the most organized group in Mass. opposing gay marriage is the Mass. Catholic church, and people aren't going to take kindly to a bunch of child rapers telling them what's right and wrong. The anti-gay side really doesn't have much to work with; it'll largely be a contest of good will and common sense vs. scare tactics, and the scare tactics have already been proven wrong.",

The polls I've seen show that Mass voters favor gay marriage. I would have thought that getting those who oppose it to put their opposition on the record before the elections would be beneficial. Then again, seeing as how the lies and fear mongering have already started, I can see how they might want to avoid having the elections muddied with the inevitable dirty fighting that would be thrown at them. Not the most couragous stance, but perhaps safer in the long run. You are right that the longer society fails to collapse the more inane the doomsayers seem.",
