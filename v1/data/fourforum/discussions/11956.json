   "In my recent thread on the Gay Rights forums, Archie accused me of being Dishonest.\n Here was my opening post on the thread: \nFrom CNN\n \n \n \nOn the first Sunday after a gay marriage ban passed in California, activists rallied in defiance, including hundreds of protesters outside an Orange County megachurch whose pastor brought Barack Obama and John McCain together last summer for a \"faith forum.\"\n \n About 300 gay-rights advocates fanned out along sidewalks leading to Saddleback Church in Lake Forest to voice their anger of the church's support of Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment approved by voters Tuesday that overturns a state Supreme Court decision in May legalizing same-sex unions.\n \n Ed Todeschini, a Human Rights Campaign volunteer, accused Saddleback in particular of helping propagate what he called misinformation about the Supreme Court ruling, including that gay marriage would have to be taught to kindergartners.\n \n A message seeking comment left at the church's main office, which was closed Sunday, was not immediately returned.\n \n \"They told such obvious lies. They used their lies to deceive the public,\" Todeschini said of the church, which gained national attention in August when its pastor, Rick Warren, brought Obama and McCain together to discuss their religious faith. The two candidates embraced during an often-contentious presidential campaign.\n \n Todeschini said Sunday's rally was peaceful, with demonstrators waving placards with slogans including \"Equality for all\" and \"Shame on you.\"\n \n The amendment was passed last week with 52 percent of the vote, and backlash at churches over their support swept across California on Sunday after days of protests.\n \n In Oakland, a large protest at the city's Mormon temple led the California Highway Patrol to close two highway ramps to ensure pedestrian safety. Protest organizers said they hoped to tone down the anger that has characterized some previous demonstrations.\n \n \"Our intent is not to disturb churchgoers,\" organizer Tim DeBenedictis said in a statement. \"Our goal is to mend fences and build bridges so that all Californians can achieve marriage equality under the law.\"\n \n The pastor of the 4,000-member All Saints Church in Pasadena spoke out against Proposition 8, calling the religious community's support of it \"embarrassing.\" Watch iReport on protests in Los Angeles >>\n \n The church announced that while it could no longer legally marry same-sex couples, it would continue blessing gay civil unions.\n \n \"It's very unfortunate and embarrassing that the (Christian religion) is in large part responsible for this act of bigotry,\" the Rev. Ed Bacon said after his sermon. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on same-sex marriage\n \n In Sacramento, a protest at the state Capitol was boisterous but peaceful as speakers led the crowd in noisy chants. Protesters waved rainbow flags, a symbol of the gay rights movement, and \"No on 8\" signs as police watched from the side.\n \n Speaking on CNN's \"Late Edition\" Sunday, Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger expressed disappointment at Proposition 8's passage.\n \n \"It is unfortunate,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"But it is not the end because I think this will go back into the courts. ... It's the same as in the 1948 case when blacks and whites were not allowed to marry. This falls into the same category.\" \n\n \n I'm glad to see that at least some pastors in this world have integrity and are not bigoted and want all citizens to have the same rights. It's refreshing to see that there are many churches like this (my own is similar), but I wish there were more who were not bigoted. The others give Christianity a bad name and cause people to associate Jesus and the church with intolerance and removal of equal rights.\n \n Oh, and couldn't agree more with Ahnuld.\n \n\n \n Then Archangel made THIS POST, accusing me of being dishonest: \nGreat, and typically dishonest of you to post about the opinion of an Episcopal church which is pro gay and one of the most liberal in Souther California: All Saints Episcopal Church is an Episcopal church in Pasadena, California. It is widely claimed to be one of Southern California's largest and most liberal churches, and is the largest Episcopal parish west of the Mississippi. It belongs to the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. All Saints is known to support gays and lesbians, opposes the death penalty, opposes the Iraq war, and supports anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan. Can you find a bible believing church that agrees with them?\n \n All Saints Episcopal Church (Pasadena, California) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n\n \n I would like Archangel to defend his accusations that I was \"dishonest\" to post an article that quoted a pastor of the Episcopal church.\n \n Please defend your claims Archie, or retract them.",

Are you ignorant or dishonest SP? If you're admitting to spiritual ignorance, then I guess I will retract calling you dishonest, do I retract it? You tell me. \n \n You also said this, which not only showed a lack of spiritual integrity but was totally dishonest, or again, just ignorant. and I quote you once again: but I wish there were more who were not bigoted.

I'm sure the slave owners and the KKK thought exactly the same thing in the 18 and 1960s respectively.\n\n \n There you go again comparing the black slavery plight with the homosexual agenda which is seeking special rights Jo. And in addition to that, you are referring to what the bible say's about slave ownership as if God encouraged it rather than understanding that God laid down rules for the treatment of servants because it was the custom of the day and existed in that time period. \n \n It is not as if the Bible ever encourages slavery. You will not find a single \n passage of scripture which in any way whatsoever encourages any follower \n of God to own slaves. However, in the Old Testament, God did allow for \n slavery. God allowed a number of practices under the Old Covenant which \n he nevertheless did not want his people to do. God made concessions under \n the Old testament for divorce, although he never wanted divorce to happen. \n \"Moses (and presumably, therefore God) permitted you to divorce because \n your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.\" \n (Matthew 19:8) \n \n I would assume God's attitude toward slavery in the Old \n Testament would fall under the same category. Slavery was a fact of life \n in the ancient world. Victory in battle produced slaves. Period. \n Therefore, for his own reasons, God chose to regulate the cruelty of \n slavery rather than to ban it outright for the Jews under the Law of \n Moses. He commanded that slaves be set free automatically after a certain \n amount of time. He forbade excessive cruelty to slaves. He commanded that \n they be allowed a certain level of access to the ceremonies of Judaism and \n so forth. See Deuteronomy 23:15, Leviticus 25:14 as examples.\n \n But in your mind, and due to your ignorance of what the bible truly means, more than what you think it say's, you, like SP and the southern slave owners of the 18th and 19th century misinterpret it to serve your purpose. The slave owners defense for owning human beings was justified just because the bible talks about the issue with no regard of what it actually say's on the subject.\n \n And here you are accusing my interpretation of being bigoted just because it doesn't fit with your preferred interpretation of very clearly written passages regarding the issue of homosexuality. So like Shadow, either you're being dishonest in your accusations that it is me who is bigoted, or you too are speaking from spiritual ignorance, because you are no different than the slave owners from America's past who corrupted what the bible REALLY say's in order to justify your perverse interpretation. And also like those slave owners, you condemn anyone who argues against your warped interpretation. \n \n And as evidence of how clear and concise these passages are which you so conveniently corrupt in your misinterpretations, I repost them as evidence that I'm not just insisting anything, but the bible is so clear that only anyone interested in interpreting the plain language cannot help but understand that God is condemning homosexuality as a practice. So as I said, the true christians are not motivated by bigotry at all, but we are not so bold as so called christians like you who pervert the bible in order to justify your own secular humanist sensibilities. Read it and weep Jo, cuz you couldn't be more wrong if you set out to be.\n Leviticus 18:22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.\n \n Leviticus 18:29 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.\n \n Leviticus 20:13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.\n \n Romans 1:26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:\n \n Romans 1:27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.\n \n Romans 1:32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8 But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;\n \n 1 Timothy 1:9 Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,\n \n 1 Timothy 1:10 For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;\n \n I know because of your denial you will come back and say the translation is lost from the original language to english, but this many times? And phrased this many different ways? Only someone who is very dishonest or completely ignorant could make such a claim Jo. So which is it? Are you also being dishonest? Or are you just completely ignorant regarding the truth of what the bible say's regarding homosexuality and also slavery, for that matter?\n https://www.evidenceforchristianity.org/index.php?option=com_custom_content&task=view&id=4264",

   "I think you're a little mixed up DU isn't radioactive, but it is highly toxic, which is probably what you're thinking of.\n \n\n You think DU is not radioactive?\n \n \nDepleted uranium\n The uranium remaining after removal of the enriched fraction contains about 99.8% 238U, 0.2% 235U and 0.001% 234U by mass; this is referred to as depleted uranium or DU. \n The main difference between DU and natural uranium is that the former contains at least three times less 235U than the latter. \n DU, consequently, is weakly radioactive and a radiation dose from it would be about 60% of that from purified natural uranium with the same mass. \n The behaviour of DU in the body is identical to that of natural uranium. \n Spent uranium fuel from nuclear reactors is sometimes reprocessed in plants for natural uranium enrichment. Some reactor-created radioisotopes can consequently contaminate the reprocessing equipment and the DU. Under these conditions another uranium isotope, 236U, may be present in the DU together with very small amounts of the transuranic elements plutonium, americium and neptunium and the fission product technetium-99. However, the additional radiation dose following intake of DU into the human body from these isotopes would be less than 1%. \n\n \n You must be getting your info from the US government. It gives around 60% of the radioactive dose of the purified stuff. That's a little more than background radiation.\n \n Okay, if you can keep the stuff out of your body then the damage it is likely to cause is not so great, but the biggest problem with the use of DU in weapons is that it is introduced into the environment as radioactive dust in the atmosphere, which can easily be breathed in or contaminate the water table. The problem is not that people are being poisoned by the stuff, the problem is the significant increase in cancer cases. And that goes for US soldiers too.\n \n @ Archie - Have you never heard of the Geneva Conventions? Look them up.

And I agree that depleted Uranium is harmful to humans. What I objected to, and still do, is the inaccuracy of your claim that we have, or are irradiating the whole place using bombs. If we were, we would in fact be nuking Iraq with nuclear weapons and we both know that isn't happening. Depleted Uranium shells which are primarily used against tanks and artillery units on the battlefield are very limited in exposing civilians to radioactive material. \n \n It's also used as shielding due to its density. And that density is also why it makes effective projectiles for piercing through hardened targets. All of this is irrelevant justification though if these projectiles were being used against civilian populations. But they aren't used that way at all. Because the military is aware of the dangers you point out, and these projectiles are extremely expensive to manufacture. So they use the proper weapon for the threat they face. This link explains the specific ammunition questions regarding this issue.\n Depleted uranium - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Here is what International law is currently debating regarding the legal status from the same link. Since the USA isn't the only Country with DU weapons, I believe an international consensus will be easier said than done.\n \n Legal status in weapons\n In 1996 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) gave an advisory opinion on the \"legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons\".[28] This made it clear, in paragraphs 54, 55 and 56, that international law on poisonous weapons, &#8211; the Second Hague Declaration of 29 July 1899, Hague Convention IV of 18 October 1907 and the Geneva Protocol of 17 June 1925 &#8211; did not cover nuclear weapons, because their prime or exclusive use was not to poison or asphyxiate. This ICJ opinion was about nuclear weapons, but the sentence \"The terms have been understood, in the practice of States, in their ordinary sense as covering weapons whose prime, or even exclusive, effect is to poison or asphyxiate,\" also removes depleted uranium weaponry from coverage by the same treaties as their primary use is not to poison or asphyxiate, but to destroy materiel and kill soldiers through kinetic energy.\n The Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities of the United Nations Human Rights Commission,[29] passed two motions[30] &#8212; the first in 1996[31] and the second in 1997.[32] They listed weapons of mass destruction, or weapons with indiscriminate effect, or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering and urged all states to curb the production and the spread of such weapons. Included in the list was weaponry containing depleted uranium. The committee authorized a working paper, in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms, of the weapons. The requested UN working paper was delivered in 2002[33] by Y.K.J. Yeung Sik Yuen in accordance with Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights resolution 2001/36. He argues that the use of DU in weapons, along with the other weapons listed by the Sub&#8209;Commission, may breach one or more of the following treaties: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Charter of the United Nations, the Genocide Convention, the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the Geneva Conventions including Protocol I, the Convention on Conventional Weapons of 1980, and the Chemical Weapons Convention. Yeung Sik Yuen writes in Paragraph 133 under the title \"Legal compliance of weapons containing DU as a new weapon\":\n Annex II to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material 1980 (which became operative on 8 February 1997) classifies DU as a category II nuclear material. Storage and transport rules are set down for that category which indicates that DU is considered sufficiently \"hot\" and dangerous to warrant these protections. But since weapons containing DU are relatively new weapons no treaty exists yet to regulate, limit or prohibit its use. The legality or illegality of DU weapons must therefore be tested by recourse to the general rules governing the use of weapons under humanitarian and human rights law which have already been analysed in Part I of this paper, and more particularly at paragraph 35 which states that parties to Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 have an obligation to ascertain that new weapons do not violate the laws and customs of war or any other international law. As mentioned, the International Court of Justice considers this rule binding customary humanitarian law.\n In 2001, Carla Del Ponte, the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, said that NATO's use of depleted uranium in former Yugoslavia could be investigated as a possible war crime.[34] Louise Arbour, Del Ponte's predecessor as chief prosecutor, had created a small, internal committee, made up of staff lawyers, to assess the allegation. Their findings, that were accepted and endorsed by Del Ponte,[35] concluded that:\n  is no specific treaty ban on the use of DU projectiles. There is a developing scientific debate and concern expressed regarding the impact of the use of such projectiles and it is possible that, in future, there will be a consensus view in international legal circles that use of such projectiles violate general principles of the law applicable to use of weapons in armed conflict. No such consensus exists at present.[36]\n \n I haven't done a search on this question, but it would be interesting to look to see if there has been a statistical increase in cancers within the Iraqi civilian population. That would go a long way in proving that these weapons have had a deleterious effect on the country.\n \n Countries with stockpiles of DU weapons are:\n  United States DOE 480,000 2002\n Russia FAEA 460,000 1996\n France Areva NC 190,000 2001\n \n United Kingdom BNFL 30,000 2001\n Germany\n Netherlands\n \n United Kingdom URENCO 16,000 1999\n \n Japan JNFL 10,000 2001\n \n China CNNC 2,000 2000\n \n South Korea KAERI 200 2002\n \n South Africa NECSA 73 2001\n TOTAL 1,188,273 2002\n \n I must add just to point out that anyone who believes the numbers China gives is not only delusional, but very naive.",

   "I am prepared to accept that the level of background radiation in Iraq has not increased to any great extent. I realise that if a lump of DU were buried several feet underground (assuming not in the water table) it would not significantly irradiate those living above it. But, as I said, the DU from the bombs and shells used there is sitting on the surface in the form of dust, which will just get blown around and breathed in by the civilian population.\n \n As for cancer cases, here is one article detailing the increase in numbers.

Given that volume, there would have been less a lot less fallout using 5 or 10 tactical nukes. NOT THAT I'M SUGGESTING THEY SHOULD HAVE. It would have been better had no hardened ammo been used at all. But I have no evidence to refute there numbers and will admit that 12 years is plenty of time to see negative health results occur. \n \n Given that the soviets and others have supplied the insurgents with weapons, I also must ask myself how much they have contributed to this problem. But either way, I do agree that it's a valid concern. And as my evidence above shows, it's an issue which isn't going to be quickly agreed upon since the international powers that be can't agree that infecting people isn't the purpose for using DU, but penetration is. Imagine that? With deadly weapons being discussed and they worry about whether or not the intended use is humane or not.",
