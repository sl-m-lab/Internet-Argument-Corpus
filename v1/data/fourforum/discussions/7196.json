The issue of evil in the world and why the sun shines on the good AND the bad has been dealt with by religious people since early on. Nothing new here. The only difference between them and you is that they haven't let that fact be a deciding factor in whether or not God exists.\n \n One of the things I notice with atheists a lot is that they give religious people way too little credit for being rational simply on the basis that those religious people came to different conclusions than they did. Do you actually think that what you brought up about a world \"indifferent\" to good and evil is something religious people haven't noticed, thought through, and dealt with long ago? Do you actually think you are bringing up something new? A lot of religious people believe in God because of what they SEE in the world and the universe and because they've thought through things. The elistist idea that belief in God or not is only a choice between ignorance or rationalism is a false delimma.

No one's arguing people can't disbelieve in God if they want. I'm simply responding to people here telling them that when people see someone visibly healed or things get to the point where it's just not coincidence (or as my young son calls it, \"coweenky-deenk\") anymore, they're more likely to believe. That TOO is a case of weighing what is observed.\n \n If what you've experienced leads you to different conclusions and you don't want to believe in God, fine. Knock yourself out. No one's making you. No one's going to beg you either. LOL, I'm reminded of the Seinfeld episode where George knows there's a cult of religious people coming to his house and he's looking forward to them trying to 'convert' him and he of course will turn them down and reject it, But when they end up not groveling and begging him to join their religion and in fact pretty much ignore him, he gets all upset. :p",

I didn't say what HAD to be the case, but rather what WAS the case.\n \n Today, the fact is that no one is born believing in God ... or Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, or the Tooth Fairy. Children are TAUGHT to believe in these mythological beings by their immediate and extended families, and others in the particular culture they are brought up in (such as the churches their parents send them to).\n \n Why do you think that, in general, people born into a Catholic family end up being Catholics themselves; people born into a Protestant family end up being Protestants themselves; people born into a Muslim family end up being Muslims themselves; people born into a Hindu family end up being Hindus themselves; and those people who were born into Native American families a few hundred years ago ended up believing in the Native American Gods?\n \n \njyoshu: If there's not an organized one there, a culture will inevitably come up with one.

So that's what I will address.\n \n Do you have any evidence that it would be INEVITABLE? If so, what evidence do you have that shows that it applies also to a scientifically advanced society? \n \n Besides, even if it were true, absent any former knowledge of Christianity, the new religion would NOT be Christianity! Seems it would just go to show that Christianity isn't a natural conclusion based on experiences: that it is the result of tradition, being TAUGHT to successive generations. And further, it would show that that people will come up with, and fully believe, in a wide range of various Gods: which again is a position that harms the validity of religion in general, since at most only one of them could be true.\n \n Also, if a someone in a completely disconnected, superstitious society were to come up with his own religion in the absence of any existing ones, logic indicates that all subsequent generations that believed in the same new God would do so because they were TAUGHT to believe in it.",

When Christ returns it will be the end of the atheist's anti-Christian madness.\n \n The Anvil that Has Worn Out Many Hammers\n \n Nineteenth century writer H.L.

So the hammers of infidels have been pecking away at this book for ages, but the hammers are worn out, and the anvil still endures. If this book had not been the book of God, men would have destroyed it long ago. Emperors and popes, kings and priests, princes and rulers have all tried their hand at it; they die and the book still lives.\"\n \n \"No other book has been so chopped, knived, sifted, scrutinized, and vilified.

The concept that the earth is just 6,000 years old is not Scripturally based. \n\n \n Sure it is. Don't you know that the Bible traces Jesus back to Adam?

It wasn't until SCIENCE stepped in and showed that such wasn't the case - based on NON-BIBLICAL studies, based on FACTS of nature - that Christians - well, the smarter ones anyway - CHANGED their religious beliefs to conform to what science had found.

   "Quotes from a book with a theme similar to the one this thread is about. The Age of Reason, by Thomas Paine. Some of these I've posted before in other threads.\n \n \nWhen also I am told that a woman, called the Virgin Mary, said, or gave out, that she was with child without any cohabitation with a man, and that her betrothed husband, Joseph, said, that an angel told him so, I have a right to believe them or not; such a circumstance required a much stronger evidence than their bare word for it: but we have not even this: for neither Joseph nor Mary wrote any such matter themselves. It is only reported by other that they said so. It is hearsay upon hearsay, and I do not chuse to rest my belief upon such evidence.\n\n \n \nWhenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortuous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness, with which more than half of the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon, than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness, that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my own part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest every thing that is cruel.\n\n \n \nDid the book, called the Bible, excel in purity of ideas and expressions, all the books that are now extant in the world, I would not take it for my rule of faith, as being the word of God; because the possibility would nevertheless exist of my being imposed upon. But when I see throughout the greatest part of this book, scarcely any thing but a history of the grossest vices, and a collection of the most paltry and contemptible tales, I cannot dishonour my Creator by calling it by his name.\n\n \n \nAs to the Christian system of faith, it appears to me as a species of atheism; a sort of religious denial of God. It professes to believe in a man rather than in God. It is a compound made up chiefly of manism with little deism, and is as near to atheism as twilight is to darkness. It introduces between man and his Maker an opaque body which it calls a redeemer ...\n\n \n \n \nIf I owe a person money, and cannot pay him, and he threatens to put me in prison, another person can take the debt upon himself, and pay it for me. But if I have committed a crime, every circumstance of the case is changed. Moral justice cannot take the innocent for the guilty, even if the innocent would offer itself. To suppose justice to do this, is to destroy the principle of its existence, which is the thing itself. It is then no longer justice. It is indiscriminate revenge.\n\n \n \n \nHe [the Christian] takes on himself to direct the Almighty what to do, even in the government of the universe. He prays dictatorily. When it is sun-shine, he prays for rain, and when it is rain, he prays for sun-shine. He follows the same idea in every thing that he prays for; for what is the amount of all his prayers, but an attempt to make the Almighty change his mind, and act otherwise than he does. It is as if he were to say - thou knowest not so well as I.\n\n \n \n \n\"From whence then could arise the solitary and strange conceit that the Almighty, who had millions of worlds equally dependent on his protection, should quit the care of all the rest, and come to die in our world, because, they say, one man and one woman had eaten an apple. And, on the other hand, are we to suppose that every world, in the boundless creation, had an Eve, and apple, a serpent, and a redeemer. In this case, the person who is irreverently called the Son of God, and sometimes God himself, would have nothing else to do than to travel from world to world, in an endless succession of death, with scarcely a momentary interval of life.\n \n It has been, by rejecting the evidence, that the word, or works of God in the creation, affords to our senses, and the action of our reason upon that evidence, that so many wild and whimsical systems of faith, and of religion, have been fabricated and set up. There may be many systems of religion, that so far from being morally bad, are in many respects morally good: but there can be but ONE that it true; and that one, necessarily must, as it ever will, be in all things consistent with the ever-existing word of God that we behold in his works. But such is the strange construction of the Christian system of faith, that every evidence the Heavens afford to man, either directly contradicts it, or renders it absurd.\n\n \n \n \n\"The Christian mythologists tell that their Satan made war against the Almighty, who defeated him, and confined him afterwards, not under a mountain [as the earlier mythologists had done with the Giants that Jupiter defeated], but in a pit. It is here easy to see that the first fable [involving Jupiter and the Giants] suggested the idea of the second; for the fable of Jupiter and the Giants was told many hundreds of years before that of Satan. \n \n ...\n \n The Christian mythologists, after having confined Satan in a pit, were obliged to let him out again, to bring on the sequel of the fable. He is then introduced into the Garden of Eden in the shape of a snake, or a serpent, and in that shape he enters into familiar conversation with Eve, who is no ways surprised to hear a snake talk; and the issue of this tete-a-tete is, that he persuades her to eat an apple, and the eating of the apple, damns all mankind.\n \n ...\n \n Having thus made an insurrection and a battle in Heaven, in which none of the combatants could either be killed or wounded - put Satan into the pit - let him out again - given him a triumph over the whole creation - damned all mankind by the eating of an apple, these Christian mythologists bring the two ends of their fable together. They represent this virtuous and amiable man, Jesus Christ, to be at once both God and man, and also the Son of God, celestially begotten on purpose to be sacrificed, because, they say, that Eve in her longing had eaten an apple.\n \n Putting aside every thing that might excite laughter by its absurdity, or detestation by its prophaneness, and confinding ourselves merely to an examination to the parts, it is impossible to conceive a story more derogatory to the Almighty, more inconsistent with his wisdom, more contradictory to his power, than this story is.\n \n In order to make for it a foundation to rise upon, the inventors were under the necessity of giving to the being, whom they call Satan, a power equally as great, if not greater, than they attribute to the Almighty. They have not only given him the power of liberating himself from the pit, after what they call his fall, but they have made that power increase afterwards to infinity. Before this fall, they represent him only as an angel of limited existence, as they represent the rest. After his fall, he becomes, by their account, omnipresent. He exists every where, and at the same time. He occupies the whole immensity of space.\n \n Not content with this deification of Satan, they represent him as defeating by stratagem, in the shape of an animal of the creation, all the power and wisdom of the Almighty. They represent him as having compelled the Almighty to the direct necessity either of surrendering the whole of the creation to the government and sovereignty of this Satan, or of capitulating for its redemption by coming down upon earth, and exhibiting himself upon a cross in the shape of a man.\n \n Had the inventors of this story told it the contrary way, that is, had they represented the Almighty as compelling Satan to exhibit himself upon a cross in the shape of a snake, as a punishment for his new transgression, the story would have been less absurd, less contradictory. But instead of this, they make the transgressor triumph, and the Almighty fall.\n \n \n \n \n \nPutting them aside, as matter of distinct consideration, the outrage offered to the moral justice of God, by supposing him to make the innocent suffer for the guilty, and also the loose morality and low contrivance of supposing him to change himself into the shape of a man, in order to make an excuse to himself for not executing his supposed sentence upon Adam; putting, I say, those things aside, as matter of distinct consideration, it is certain, that what is called the christian system of faith, including in it the whimsical account of the creation; the strange story of Eve, the snake, and the apple; the amphibious idea of a man-god; the corporeal idea of the death of a god; the mythological idea of a family of gods; and the christian system of arithmetic, that three are one, and one is three, are all irreconcilable, not only to the divine gift of reason that God has given to man, but to the knowledge that man gains of the power and wisdom of God, by the aid of the science, and by studying the universe that God has made.\n \n The setters up, therefore, and the advocates of the christian system of faith, could not but foresee that the continually progressive knowledge that man would gain by the aid of science, of the power and wisdom of God, manifested in the structure of the universe, and in all the works of creation, would militate against, and call into question, the truth of their system of faith; and therefore it became necessary to their purpose to cut learning down to a size less dangerous to their project, and this they effected by restricting the idea of learning to the dead study of dead languages.\n \n They not only rejected the study of science out of the christian schools, but they persecuted it; and it is only within about the last two centuries that the study has been revived. So late as 1610 Galileo, a Florentine, discovered and introduced the use of telescopes, and by applying them to observe the motions and appearance of the heavenly bodies, afforded additional means for ascertaining the true structure of the universe. Instead of being esteemed for these discoveries, he was sentenced to renounce them, or the opinions resulting from them, as a damnable heresy. And prior to that time Vigilius was condemned to be burned for asserting that antipodes, or in other words, that the earth was a globe, and habitable in every part where there was land; yet the truth of this is now too well known even to be told.\n \n If the belief of errors not morally bad did no mischief, it would make not part of the moral duty of man to oppose and remove them. There was no moral ill in believing the earth was flat like a trencher, any more than there was moral virtue in believing it was round like a globe; neither was there any moral ill in believing that the Creator made no other world than this, any more than there was moral virtue in believing that he made millions, and that the infinity of space is filled with worlds. But when a system of religion is made to grow out of a supposed system of creation that is not true, and to unite itself therewith in a manner almost inseparable therefrom, the case assumes an entirely different ground. It is then that errors, no morally bad, become fraught with the same mischiefs as if they were. It is then that the truth, though otherwise indifferent itself, becomes an essential, by becoming the criterion, that either confirms by corresponding evidence, or denies by contradicting evidence, the reality of the religion itself. In this view of the case it is the moral duty of man to obtain every possible evidence, that the structure of the heavens, or any other part of creation affords, with respect to the systems of religion. But this, the supporters and partizans of the christian system, as if dreading the result, incessantly opposed, and not only rejected the sciences, but persecuted the professors. Had Newton or Descartes lived three or four hundred years ago, and pursued their studies as they did, it is most probable they would not have lived to finish them; and had Franklin drawn lightning from the clouds at the same time, it would have been at the hazard of expiring for it in flames.\n \n Latter times have laid all the blame upon the Goths and Vandals, but, however unwilling the partizans of the Christian system may be to believe or to acknowledge it, it is nevertheless true, that the age of ignorance commenced with the Christian system.\n",

   "The main reason that rational, non-religious people like myself, DamEtel and Kronus get so annoyed with religious people is, I think, due to the fact that we are so very aware of all the hatred, pain and suffering that religion has caused over the centuries.\n Over here in freezing blighty there is a TV show on next monday on channel 4 hosted by the eminent scientist-philosopher Richard Dawkins called \"The Root of All Evil\", in which he proposes various arguments for why we should reject all religions.\n I only bring this up because one of the things he says on the advert for it sums up how I feel in a very precise way:\n \"With or without religion, we still have good people doing good things, and evil people doing evil things. It takes religion for good people to commit evil acts\"\n \n I'll make it clear now that I am no atheist. There may be a supreme intelligence, or there may not. It honestly makes little difference to me and I've long since stopped worrying about it.\n However, as has been argued very convincingly by many people, religions in general are an obvious sham, evidenced mainly by the large numbers of different faiths who all claim to be the One True Way.\n \n Back to Richard Dawkins' quote and my point, when people believe in religious dogma and systems of indoctrination, they can be convinced to do things that otherwise they would consider morally reprehensible. This doesn't just go for religion, look at the social indoctrination of Nazism which created a generation of people whose morality we cannot understand, particularly those youths who joined the SS.\n Now, I am not comparing Christianity and Nazism other than to say that they are both (along with all religions and extremist ideologies) systems of indoctrination which can be used to make people commit horrible acts.\n \n And I'm sorry, but it doesn't matter how many people tell me that Christianity is a religion of peace, because history proves you wrong. The ideology may preach love thy neighbour, but in practice it has always been love thy neighbour if he is also Christian, if not, be very suspicious of him, have no respect for him, and sometimes go and kill him.\n \n Just having faith (ie deism which is an aspect of all religions) is harmful to no one, but having faith in words written by other humans hundreds or thousands of years ago to the point where you will reject obviously worthy arguments based on modern science and modern morality in favour of these outdated, dogmatic, indoctrination systems can often lead to violence.\n \n I know that this is an old argument but I think it is a very strong one, and I am not writing this just to annoy the Christians who post on this board. \n I genuinely believe organised dogmatic religion to be a major obstacle to our development as a species and I cannot understand why people put their faith in old books, that's all they are, just old books! \n \n There has been a lot of mention of how the US is the land of the free in this thread, and hence how the theists and atheists alike are free to say what they want and get annoyed with each other, but I don't think you can truly have a free country without getting rid of religious texts. Morality is taught to us by our parents and society, not by ancient books, we should all be free to worship and pray as much as we want but get rid of the bloody texts!",

Sorry to dissappoint you. It ain't that way, nor did it ever claim to be. Believe what you want--you aren't going to be begged and groveled with to join Christianity here. In the meantime, Christians the world over will continue to support humanitarian efforts, build homes for the homeless, travel to 3rd world countries with food and aid, build and volunteer at soup kitchens for the homeless, provide educational initiatives for people on the street, care for AIDS victims, etc., etc., etc. That's not to say that any of those activities can be done by non-Christians as well.

   "I don't think so. I think it's prejudice, pure and simple. Otherwise you'd note the fact that there has been a whole other side historically, that was benevolent and humanitarian.\n \n\n \n Many religious individuals have been benevolent, loving, and caring. However, religions themselves have, as often as not, been vehicles for close minded persecution. The essential problem is that if a person, speaking for themselves, presents an idea, then the idea is obviously open to debate, discussion, amendment, or dismissal. Only an insanely meglomaniacal person would assert that whatever they say must, by definition, be right. On the other hand, if someone says that they are speaking for God, then far too often they are absolutely precluding the possibility of debate, discussion, amendment, or dismissal. They say that God said, and that's the end of it. This isn't called insanity, it's called faith. However, the results from the outside look the same. People have killed, tortured, and raped in the name of their Gods, and no religion is immune to this. Acting \"in the name of God\" presents people with a huge temptation to do whatever they want, and eschew all responsibility, calling it \"God's will\". The fault here is clearly human nature, but religion provides an easy route for the worst in human nature to express itself. Religion does also give people the opportunity to express the best in themselves, this is true. But I don't belive that religion is the only way we can tap the best in people, and I don't see how we can prevent the abuses that religion is so especially prone to.",
