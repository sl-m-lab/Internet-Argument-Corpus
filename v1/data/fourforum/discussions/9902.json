   "The concept that DNA alone is responsible for all heritable traits between individuals in a population has been so hammered into peoples' brains by science and the media that it's going to be difficult to unhammer it. But that's exactly what needs to be done. And in the process of doing so, the whole theory of evolution will have to be reworked.\n \n Recently much has been said on this forum about nonrandom variation. My contention is that it undermines selection. But let's look at both sides of the issue: According to ToE, traits arise randomly, unoriented to the environment and unbiased to adaptive improvement. If this indeed is the case, it would be fair to assume that each organism in a given population would be subject to selection because each would be blessed with varying abilities, which would ultimately bring about competition to survive. The key here, of course is random variation. Here's Richard Dawkin's take on variation. Please keep in mind that he doesn't even bring up epigenetics in his books, he's still living in fairytale land that mutation is the begetter of all change. Having said that, notice his emphatic denial of any adaptive direction to variation and that selection is the only thing that gives direction to evolution:\n \n \"There is a fifth respect in which mutation might have been nonrandom. We can imagine (just) a form of mutation that was systematically biased in the direction of improving the \n animal's adaptedness to its life. But although we can imagine it, nobody has ever come close to suggesting any means by which this bias could come about. It is only in this fifth respect, the 'mutationist' respect, that the true, real-life Darwinian insists that mutation is \n random. Mutation is not systematically biased in the direction of adaptive improvement, and no mechanism is known (to put the point mildly) that could guide mutation in directions that are non-random in this fifth sense. Mutation is random with respect to adaptive advantage, although it is non- random in all sorts of other respects. It is selection, and only selection, that directs evolution in directions that are nonrandom with respect to advantage.\"(Dawkins R., \"The Blind Watchmaker,\" [1986], Penguin: London, 1991, reprint, p.312)\n \n Dawkins, though he is wrong about the nonrandomness of mutation, understands his predicament. He knows -- though many in here do not -- that the only way that a mechanical system of evolution will hold up is if variation is random. Period. No ifs ands or buts.\n \n To stick another fork in this dead bird, according to ToE, evolution is seen in terms of changes in gene frequencies and DNA sequences. But with epigenetics it's not so much changes in genes (or not at all, actually) but simply a change in traits. And that's the kicker. Evolutionists in here like to embrace epigenetics, but what they don't realize is by doing so, they are admitting that evolution is no longer an accumulation of selected genes ----- instead, it's an accumulation of selected traits. Oops.\n \n So with that, it's going to get real hairy....and here's why. Evolutionists, up until now, have made it easy on themselves; they've said genes do funny things for no apparent reason; genes simply mutate, end of story. But now everything gets more complicated because instead of simple, mindless changes in genes, they now have to incorporate everything that goes into creating a new, purposeful, heritable epigenetic trait. This, of course, requires the observance of the animal as a whole, which goes against their religion of reductionism. And along with that, as opposed to just focusing on one particular gene, science now has to look at all the countless, insanely-complex network of interactions that go on in the body. They also have to somehow decipher how the information from the environment gets transmitted to the organism. This begins with a process of thoughts, sensations, beliefs, or other mystical feelings on behalf of the organism, which then somehow get manifested into physical realities. And this ain't science -- because science will never be able to answer such questions; this is philosophy. Is it any wonder epigenetics has been hidden in the closet?\n \n But back to natural selection:\n \n So, I could certainly see, if variation was truly random that selection could theoretically pick from a pool of random variants. Unfortunately for evolutionists, the concept of randomness when it comes to new traits has never actually been proven. In fact, whenever animals experience an environmental shift, they have this bad habit of shifting right along with it, starting with an internal response from each creature who somehow \"senses\" this change. It's hardly logical to call this random. \n \n But if each individual of a population experiences the same environmental cue, and each member simultaneously evolves the same traits epigenetically, not only will this speed up evolution exponentially, but it will also give each member the same traits at the same time -- which ultimately gives them the same basic fitness ----- which undermines natural selection, making mortality/breeding success mostly a lottery of circumstance, with a little sexual selection thrown in.\n \n ---------------\n \n And back to what Dawkins stated above about mutations always being random....please read what Eva Jablonka referring to induced local mutations:\n \n Mutations are therefore both induced by the environment and are specific to the gene that can save the day. In no sense is this type of mutation random -- mutations are both required and acquired. Evolution in Four Dimensions Pg.97",

Darwinian mechanisms are hypotheses that biologists test. They also test non-Darwinian hypotheses. If a Darwinian hypothesis fails to explain a particular trait, so much the worse for that particular hypothesis. Biologists have proposed alternatives to strict Darwinian selection to explain many features in evolution.\n \n What do epigenetic features mean for Darwinian theories? Well, it's not obvious, yet. After all, Darwin didn't know about genes. Biologists had a terrible time getting evolution and genetics to fit together, before they succeeded. If there is a reality to the hypothesis of epigenetic inheritance, then its fit is going to have to be figured out.\n \n Still, even if epigenetic inheritance proves significant, it's not going to displace Darwinian evolution. More likely, it will add a gloss over it. Different species mostly do differ genetically, after all, not merely epigenetically. And whether a change is due to genetic mutation or epigenetic alteration in gene expression, it's still going to be subject to selection.\n \n Darwin is pretty secure. Arguments about genetics vs. epigenetics are interesting, but they won't change the basic facts of life.",

I understand that each creature has a varying \"genetic background,\" which may play a role in his ability to evolve with the environment, but if you look at any given population of animals, they generally all look the same, at least on the outside. When you see a school of fish or a flock of seagulls or a swarm of locusts you'd probably find it difficult to distinguish one from the next. To me, the fact that there is this similarity on the outside suggests that there's probably a similarity on the inside as well. It stretches the imagination that one member of a population would react too terribly different to an environmental cue than all the rest. Even if there were some who did not respond equally, selection would still be only playing a \"stablizing\" role, and not the creative role it would be playing if variation were truly random.\n \n \n Now, I have no problem with the concept of epigenetic inheritance. But even if it were true it wouldn't do away with natural selection. Just as with basic genetic mutation, which isn't going to go away, one would expect some individuals to exhibit epigenetic alterations and others not to. \n\n \n Well that's true under one condition: that there is such thing as a random mutation that creates a new, beneficial body part or function. I'm not sure this has ever been established as fact. (How does science go about proving randomness in a mutation, anyway?...it seems to me that one must accept that mutations are random by faith.)\n \n \"It is our contention that if 'random' is given a serious and crucial interpretation from a probabilistic point of view, the randomness postulate is highly implausible and that an adequate scientific theory of evolution must await the discovery and elucidation of new natural laws.\"-*Murray Eden, \"Inadequacies of Neo-Darwinian Evolution as Scientific Theory,\" in Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Theory of Evolution (1967), p. 109.\n \n \n This still means a population containing a range of variants that natural selection can act on, preserving some epigenetic alterations as opposed to others.\n \n but if the variation is nonrandom, it doesn't matter: selection's role, like I said above, would be doing nothing more than eliminating the weaklings. According to ToE, selection is a creative force of evolution, guiding the direction of evolution.\n \n Gould:\n \n The central logic of Darwinism requires that natural selection not merely operate, but that it be the creative force of evolutionary change. Selection wins its role as a creative force because the other component of evolutionary mechanics - the forces that produce the raw material of genetic variation - are random, in the special sense of \"not inherently directed toward adaptation.\" That is, if local environments change and smaller organisms are now at an advantage, genetic variation does not produce more small individuals, thus imparting a direction to evolutionary change from the level of variation itself. Variation continues to occur\"at random,\" in a broad spectrum about the average size. Selection must impart direction - and be the creative force of evolution - by differentially preserving those random variants yielding smaller than average phenotypes.\n \n \n \n \n Of course, if the claim is that epigenetic alterations are somehow directed by the environment, i.e. are teleological in origin, then the onus is on the advocates to demonstrate how this direction occurs.

Even if there were some who did not respond equally, selection would still be only playing a \"stablizing\" role, and not the creative role it would be playing if variation were truly random.\n\n \n All natural selection is, is a passive sieve that organisms go through before they succeed in breeding. It's only creative in the sense that variation, whether it is genetic or epigenetic, offers novel phenotypes for NS to act on.\n \n \nWell that's true under one condition: that there is such thing as a random mutation that creates a new, beneficial body part or function. I'm not sure this has ever been established as fact. (How does science go about proving randomness in a mutation, anyway?...it seems to me that one must accept that mutations are random by faith.)\n\n \n You seem to have faith that variation must be non-random. Do you have evidence for this supposition? What is the force that directs variation into particular channels and prevents them in others?\n \n Now, there is a concept in modern Darwinian theory called canalization, which is the theory that genetic networks exhibit considerable phenotypic stability, being fairly resistant to mild mutation. So it may take considerable mutation to bounce a species, as it were, from one basin of phenotypic stability in the fitness landscape into another. And it's certainly possible that some directions of genetic change may be more likely to be sampled than others, and certainly many will be immediately lethal, so those trajectories cannot be sampled at all.\n \n Still, even so, I know of no evidence to suggest that mutations occur in a directed, tailor-made way in order to take advantage of changes in the environment. You be sure that they are, one would have to establish a mechanism to assure directionality, and prevent unfavourable mutations. Do you know of one? \n \n \n\"It is our contention that if 'random' is given a serious and crucial interpretation from a probabilistic point of view, the randomness postulate is highly implausible and that an adequate scientific theory of evolution must await the discovery and elucidation of new natural laws.\"-*Murray Eden, \"Inadequacies of Neo-Darwinian Evolution as Scientific Theory,\" in Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Theory of Evolution (1967), p. 109.\n\n \n Well, I just don't see this. It's an observable fact that species produce far more progeny than can possibly hope to survive. Consequently, the grim reaper will take most of them before they can breed -- which is NS in action. There is absolutely nothing implausible about variation being random, with only those variants that are compatible with environmental conditions having a chance of success.

A cell or organism an autofeedback, homeostatic system that maintains itself as long as it is capable of processing energy available to it.

   "http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/dp5/lipton.htm\n \n Darwinism and epigenetics\n \n Lipton argues that genes cannot control life because they cannot turn themselves on or off. That is done by signals from the cellular environment. Epigenetics, the study of the molecular mechanisms by which the environment controls gene activity, is today one of the most active areas of scientific research. Environmental influences, including nutrition, stress, and emotions, can modify genes, without changing their basic blueprint, and these modifications can be passed on to future generations. DNA makes up only half the content of chromosomes; the other half consists of regulatory proteins, which are turning out to play as crucial a role in heredity as DNA. Studies of protein synthesis reveal that epigenetic factors can create 2000 or more variations of proteins from the same gene blueprint.\n \n Biologists' central dogma (first formulated by Francis Crick) posits the 'primacy of DNA', involving a one-way flow of information from DNA to RNA to proteins. Lipton, on the other hand, argues for the 'primacy of the environment'. Regulatory genes direct the activity of protein-encoding genes, but environmental signals control how regulatory proteins bind to DNA. The flow of information is therefore: environmental signal - regulatory protein - DNA - RNA - protein. Information can also flow in the reverse direction, but subject to tight restrictions: RNA can rewrite DNA, protein antibodies can change DNA, and changes in DNA influence the binding of regulatory proteins.\n \n Evidence for the role of epigenetic mechanisms has become so compelling that some scientists have started speaking favourably again of Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck (1744-1829), the much-scorned evolutionist who believed that traits acquired as result of environmental influence could sometimes be passed on to offspring. The genome is certainly turning out to be far more fluid and responsive to the environment than previously supposed. It is clear that DNA does not control biology, and that information can be transmitted to descendants in ways other than through the base sequence of DNA.\n \n Whereas traditional darwinism sees evolution as essentially random, purposeless, and violently competitive, Lamarck suggested that evolution was based on cooperative interaction among organisms and their environment. In Darwin's Blind Spot (2002), Frank Ryan chronicles a number of striking examples of cooperation among organisms. For instance, there is a yellow shrimp that gathers food while its partner gobi fish protects it from predators. There is also a species of hermit crab that carries a pink anemone on top of its shell. Fish and octopuses like to feed on hermit crabs, but when they approach this species, the anemone shoots out its brilliantly coloured tentacles, with their microscopic batteries of poisoned darts, and stings the potential predator. In return, the anemone eats the crab's leftover food.\n \n We now know that genes are transferred between members of the same species and of different species. This highlights the dangers of genetic engineering. Tinkering with the genes of a tomato, for example, could alter the entire biosphere in unforeseen ways. One study has shown that when humans digest genetically modified foods, the artificially created genes transfer into and alter the beneficial bacteria in the intestine. Similarly, gene transfer among genetically engineered agricultural crops and surrounding native species has given rise to highly resistant superweeds. As Lipton says, scientists are messing around with our genes and environment without understanding how interconnected everything is.\n \n Cells, brains, membranes\n \n Although cells appear to be anatomically simple, they display incredible complexity and power, and employ technologies that scientists have barely begun to understand. Like humans, single cells analyze thousands of stimuli from the microenvironment they inhabit, and select appropriate behavioural responses to ensure their survival. They are even capable of altering their own genes.\n \n Lipton rejects the orthodox idea that the nucleus is the cell's brain. If their nuclei and genes are removed, cells can survive for up to two months or more. They continue to exhibit complex, coordinated, life-sustaining behaviours, but eventually die - not because they have lost their brain but because they have lost their reproductive capabilities and are unable to replace failed proteins or replicate themselves. In other words, the nucleus is the cell's gonad. Lipton comments:\n \n Confusing the gonad with the brain is an understandable error because science has always been and still is a patriarchal endeavor. Males have often been accused of thinking with their gonads, so it's not entirely surprising that science has inadvertently confused the nucleus with the cell's brain! (p. 66)\n \n Lipton proposes that the true brain controlling cellular life is the membrane - the 'magical mem-brain', as he calls it. The membrane is a semi-permeable, three-layered skin, only seven millionths of a millimetre thick, which holds the contents of a cell together. But behind its apparent simplicity lies great functional complexity. For instance, prokaryotes, which include bacteria and other microbes, consist of a cell membrane enveloping a droplet of cytoplasm, yet they display 'intelligence'. They can sense the presence of food and propel themselves towards it, and they can recognize toxins and predators and take evasive action.\n \n Instead of the cell's operations being controlled by DNA blueprints stored in the nucleus, as conventional biology would have us believe, Lipton proposes that this is done by integral membrane proteins (IMPs) - which include receptor (awareness) and effector (action) proteins. The membrane's effector proteins, operating in response to molecular and radiant-energy signals which its receptors pick up from the environment, control the 'reading' of genes so that worn-out proteins can be replaced or new proteins created.\n \n The cell's operations are therefore primarily moulded by its interaction with the environment, not by its genetic code. Genes cannot preprogram a cell or an organism's life, because cell survival depends on the ability to dynamically adjust to an ever-changing environment. In Lipton's view, the membrane's function of interacting 'intelligently' with the environment to produce behaviour makes it the true brain of the cell; if the membrane is destroyed, the cell dies. In multicellular organisms key functions of the membrane are taken over by specialized tissues and organs - nervous system, lungs, muscles, etc.",

   "so why have darwinists ignored symbiosis for decades if it was so compatible? Same with developmental biology? Why have developmental biologists been locked away in closets, never to be heard from until recently when they've forced themselves upon the scientific community?\n \n The reality is you have no choice: accept that organisms cooperate with each other and respond purposefully and intelligently to the environment or else.\n \n Tell me though: do you now admit that individuals evolve, not populations?\n, \n \n 1) Darwinists have not \"ignored\" symbiosis. As a student of biological systems including hosts and pathogens I studied it from an evolutionary perspective as early as 1964 or so. There is not any problem known to me with co-evolution of two (or more) species having interactions. This goes right down to obligate parasites and even to integrated organelles such as chloroplasts, and even to inserted viral genes in the human genome. A particulary interesting example is the chloroplast like organ in the malaria parasite - a strange case that one. :)\n \n The reality in fact is that organisms can interact and yield symbiotic relationships with no purpose at all being involved. Its pure population dynamics and contingency imposed by variability. Certainly no intelligence involved as the equations tell the tale. And sybiosis to the degree of say an obligate rust parasite is quite rare given the large numbers of interacting (an co-evolving) species on a pair-wise basis. Its not a matter of \"intelligence\" unless you think that wheat plants and rust fungi have brains hidden somewhere!!!:) \n \n It is impossible for an individual to \"evolve\" since the core process of evolution requires gene frequency changes in populations. Any new gene appearing in an individual has to survive through reproductive cycles to count as evolution. What actually evolves is linages as their frequencies in a given population change. An new heritable variant appears in an individual and a new linage is added, how that linage carrying the variant does within the existing populations linages controls how that gene frequency changes over time. It takes many generations for most of a population to come to sharing the new variant if its \"beneficial\".",

Not all genes will undergo horizontal transfer with equal likelihood - that means its a selective process emoticon_xangel \n\n \n now now....let me explain to you how selection works. First, a mutant will randomly appear in a population. If this mutant happens to be gifted with a trait that's beneficial, he or she will be more likely to breed than the rest of the population, thus passing the trait down vertically to progeny. Over time this will increase the frequency of this trait in the population. That's how selection works.\n \n Horizontal gene transfer is not that. Let's play like we have a plant.

Well, what the farmer doesn't realize is that unless the cow manure is fully decomposed, it may be laced with all kinds of bacteria. Well when the bacteria in the manure hits the soil, little genes have a way of hopping from the manure to the soil. Not only that, but little genes also have a way of making it from the soil to the plant that's growing in it. These genes are thus not selected -- nothing dies...there is no breeding success or nonsuccess -- the genes simply jump ship.

Mutants are not required only a population which contains variant linages, and not all variant linages are mutations.\n \n Horizontal gene transfer is not that. \n \n Nope horizontal gene transfer is just another source of variability. The source of variability does not control whether or not the variant undergoes selection.\n \n \n \n Let's play like we have a plant. \n \n OK I am a botanist by training so I guess I can cope with that.\n \n And that plant is rooted in some soil. Well along comes some smart farmer who thinks it's a good idea to throw some cow manure on the soil so the plant will grow better.  \n \n OK the farmer knows his stuff then.\n \n Well, what the farmer doesn't realize is that unless the cow manure is fully decomposed, it may be laced with all kinds of bacteria.  \n \n Unless its decomposed to CO2, water, and inorganic salts its not fully decomposed and it will not be so much laced with bacteria and it will be loaded to the gills with the little darlings.\n \n Well when the bacteria in the manure hits the soil, little genes have a way of hopping from the manure to the soil. Not only that, but little genes also have a way of making it from the soil to the plant that's growing in it. These genes are thus not selected -- nothing dies...there is no breeding success or nonsuccess -- the genes simply jump ship.  \n \n You are likely confusing trasposons with horizontal transfer, but so be it. Free DNA in the soil has a devil of a time surviving its gobbled up lickity split by various very hungry microbes and free enzymes in the soil. Most genetic sequences which might reach a plant are selected AGAINST very quickly. Only under unusual circumstances (for example see Agrobacterium tumifaciens) does a non-plant gene integrate into a plant genome. And in any case selection (of the plant genome) only refers to the next generations heritability of the new variant.\n \n This is a problem for Toe \n \n No its is not. Its just a new source of variability which may be heritable differentially through selection. It fits in perfectly.\n \n -- and it happens all over creation via viruses and other mobil elements. \n \n Yes it does happen, especially with integration of viral genes. However its still just a source of genetic variation so far as evolution is concerned.

Of course many will say it's not, but all you have to do is know that darwinists have always claimed that all beneficial traits must pass through natural selection to know that this is a contradiction to that edict.\n \n \n Nope, evolutionists have not ignored symbiotic relationships. I worked under a professor who was investigating the evolution of such relationships as early as the 1930s. And evolutionists have not made the claim you assert. The only claim is that variants are subject to selective reproductive success. Again the source of variation has no bearing on that.\n \n \n If you disagree with me that all beneficial traits must pass through natural selection, please view this video: (skip to the 8 minute mark and watch for one minute.)after you watch it, please tell me how epigenetics and HGT fits into that picture when all kinds of beneficial traits can appear in offspring without going through natural selection...\n \n I watched it and it does support the concept that all traits pass to the next generation in a possibly selective way. Of course that is the case. Unless every trait has uniform heritability it must be. Once more epigenitics etc are simply sources of variability against which selection can take place. Mutation yields variation also without first undergoing selection. First comes variability then comes selection and selection in the end means relative reproductive success and its not tied to the source of variability.",

   "so tell me, how does it fit under the darwinian umbrella when new genes (and new traits) can be passed from one organism (horizontally) to another organism...without these beneficial genes or traits going through the selection process? Do you deny that ToE states that all beneficial traits must pass through selection?\n \n Also, please explain to me how it is that neo-darwinism, which is constructed on a platform of randomness, can stand the reality that organisms pass specific genes to each other?\n\n \n Well, chemist has addressed your comments, but let me add a footnote.\n \n First of all, biologists have long known that Darwinian selection is not the only mechanism responsible for evolution. Second, horizontal gene transfer is still part of a selective process, in that organisms transformed by the genetic influx must then be tested against the environment -- this is just an additional way of acquiring novel genetic information, and is not something contrary to Darwinian theory. Third, Darwinian selection is not based on \"a platform of randomness\", except in the apparent lack of significant directionality in the direction of variation, whether the variation arises by mutation of an indigenous genome or by the invasion of genes from an different genome. Natural selection provides a strong, non-random element to Darwinian theory.\n \n What I'm objecting to in your attacks on Darwinian thinking is not any claim that it can't explain everything about evolution -- that's a given long accepted by biologists since Darwin. It's that new discoveries are making Darwinian theory obsolete. They aren't. There is nothing incompatible between new ways of creating novel genetic information and the selection process through which its utility is tested. Neither is there anything incompatible between selection of genomes in the generation of new species, and the phenotypic adaptability of individual organisms. Such adaptability can also in principle evolve in Darwinian ways. Neither is there anything incompatible between selection mechanisms and the discovery of how a limited set of genes can control development.\n \n You are seeing problems and incompatibilities where none really exist.",

   "Oh, and to concur with chemist, Darwinian selection doesn't require that mutations be totally random in the sense of truly stochastic, it's just that there is thus far no reason to suppose there is any mechanism to direct DNA mutations selectively to favour those which could take advantage of particularities of the environment. For example, if a climate would favour animals who could grow woollier coats in winter than in summer, there is no reason to suppose that a species has the capacity to concentrate its mutations in that direction rather than in others. No such goal-orientated mutational mechanisms have been found, though they have been proposed but not confirmed.\n \n The apparent non-directional nature of mutations, however, doesn't mean that any and all mutations are equally likely. Some kinds may be more common than others, some bits of DNA may be more likely to mutate than others. Further, many, perhaps most mutations will never be exposed to natural selection either because they are invisible to it, resulting in a non-Darwinian evolutionary mechanism called genetic drift, or because structural or developmental constraints prevent the formation of a viable organism to begin with. But even if all conceivable variants aren't equally likely or possible, that doesn't mean that once they appear, they aren't subject to selection by the environment.\n \n Lastly, there is no known mechanism that can account for Lamarckian-type evolution. There have been many experiments by biological hopefuls such as Kammerer with his toads, but never has an acquired characteristic been found to be heritably transmitted. There is simply no known way of faithfully copying changes in a somatic cell's genome to the germ cells, unless they undergo similar DNA mutations or epigenetic alterations through a similar chemical agent, which is unlikely if not impossible. It is true that some epigenetic modifications can survive inter-generational transfer for a few generations because they are made simultaneously to somatic and germ cells, but so far as I know, none are known to survive indefinitely, and they seem be exceptions rather than the rule.\n \n In any case, even if epigenetic transfer of information to new generations is a significant mechanism in evolution, it's still not going to displace Darwinian selection, because that selection process is not wedded to any particular way of transmitting information, whether it is genetic or epigenetic. Even if a stable new species could arise purely by epigenetic modifications -- and this is an interesting question, but there is as yet no evidence that a single genome can encode two separate species -- it would still be subject to natural selection. If evidence for epigenetic speciation is discovered, it would be an additional mechanism within the overarching Darwinian theory, and not a replacement for it",

But now you're saying variation is nonrandom! This changes the whole philosophy your theory was based on!\n Well I did not say that variation is directed in some way. It can be non-random in and still remain undirected. By non-random one means simply that the likelyhood of a change at all base pairs is not equal. Chemistry and the effect of loca chemical environment virtually assures that some bases in the sequence will be more subject to alteration than others. This also applies to any methylation of DNA etc. \n \n Now consider what you are attempting to imply by the term \"non-random\". If I have you down right you would assert that the non-randomness results in a change vector which is more parallel than otherwise to the change vector which would drive the species towards greater fitness. In other words you assert that heritable ben Ieficial changes will significantly outnumber heritable neutral or deleterious changes in a given situation. There is so far as I know absolutely no evidence for this. The classical method for testing this would be to tabulate all heritable changes in an organism (including epigenetic) and compare them with the optimum change vector most likely by finding the angle between the two vectors. If the angle is characteristically less than 90 degrees then some directivity may be present. However I am relatively certain that I would have encountered such studies if they had been done.\n \n To maintain alignment of the change vector with the optimum change vector would require ongoing intervention by the \"director\" thus you would necessarily attribute active intelligence to such a process. Again there is no evidence for this outside of our own genetic engineeriing activities.\n \n Your argument falls for lack of support AND because a demonstrable directive (though non-intelligent) mechanism is available - namely the selection phase of evolution.

Natural selection is inevitable as long as the number of offspring outnumber available resources. It doesn't matter whether variation is 100% random, 50% random or 5% random. It doesn't matter whether variation is 100% genetic, 50% genetic or 5% genetic, with the rest due to epigenetic alterations.\n \n And finally, if there are non-random elements to variation, they would be naturalistic in origin, result from canalisation constraints, such as development requirements, or differential lability to mutation. They certainly aren't going to be because organisms can miraculously guess which mutations or epigenetic variations are going to be successful in a future its can't see or predict.\n \n If you can come up with evidence for directed variation, be it by mutation or epigenetic alteration, be my guess. I need evidence for the speculation it is directed, which you have been curiously reluctant to provide.\n \n But then, Creationists never do provide evidence for anything.",

   "No better way to put the rabble back in their place is there.\n \n From Wikipedia Biological Fitness:\n \n \"\nMeasures of fitness\n \n \"There are two commonly used measures of fitness; absolute fitness and relative fitness.\n \n \"Absolute fitness (wabs) of a genotype is defined as the ratio between the number of individuals with that genotype after selection to those before selection. It is calculated for a single generation and may be calculated from absolute numbers or from frequencies. When the fitness is larger than 1.0, the genotype increases in frequency; a ratio smaller than 1.0 indicates a decrease in frequency.\n \n w(abs) = N(after)/N(before)\n \n \"Absolute fitness for a genotype can also be calculated as the product of the proportion survival times the average fecundity.\n \n \"Relative fitness is quantified as the average number of surviving progeny of a particular genotype compared with average number of surviving progeny of competing genotypes after a single generation, i.e. one genotype is normalized at w = 1 and the fitnesses of other genotypes are measured with respect to that genotype. Relative fitness can therefore take any nonnegative value, including 0.\n \n \"While researchers can usually measure relative fitness, absolute fitness is more difficult. It is often difficult to determine how many individuals of a genotype there were immediately after reproduction.\n \n \"The two concepts are related, and both of them are equivalent when they are divided by the mean fitness, which is weighted by genotype frequencies.\n \n w(abs)/w-(abs) = w(rel)/w-(rel)\n \n \"This leads to the well known Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection. Fisher's teorem states that: \"The rate of increase in the mean fitness of any organism at any time ascribable to natural selection acting through changes in gene frequencies is exactly equal to its genic variance in fitness at that time\". This may be somewhat dubious because selection takes place on the individual level, ruling the enrichment of genes (Mayr 2001). In addition, according to Maynard Smith, a population may reach a state of selective equilibrium, in which case the increase of mean fitness is equal to zero, but not ncessarily the variance in fitness.\n \n \"Because fitness is a coefficient, and a variable may be multiplied by it several times, biologists may work with \"log fitness\" (particularly so before the advent of computers). By taking the logarithm of fitness each term may be added rather than multiplied. A fitness landscape, first conceptualized by Sewall Wright, is a way of visualising fitness in terms of a three-dimensional surface on which peaks correspond to local fitness maxima; it is often said that natural selection always progresses uphill but can only do so locally. This can result in suboptimal local maxima becoming stable, because natural selection cannot return to the less-fit \"valleys\" of the landscape on the way to reach higher peaks.\n \n \"The related concept of genetic load measures the overall fitness of a population of individuals of many genotypes whose fitnesses vary, relative to a hypothetical population in which the most fit genotype has become fixed.\n \n \"As another example we may mention the definition of fitness given by Maynard Smith in the following way: \"Fitness is a property, not of an individual, but of a class of individuals - for example homozygous for allele A at a particular locus. Thus the phrase 'expected number of offspring' means the average number, not the number produced by some one individual. If the first human infant with a gene for levitation were struck by lightning in its pram, this would not prove the new genotype to have low fitness, but only that the particular child was unlucky.\" This measure is certainly useful in breeding programs, but hardly as a basis of a model of an evolution selecting individuals, because evolution would hardly know if the individual may be selected or not.\n \n \"Yet another possible measure has been formulated by Hartl,1981: \"The fitness of the individual - having an array x of phenotypes - is the probability, s(x), that the individual will be included among the group selected as parents of the next generation.\" Then, the mean fitness may be determined as a mean over the set of individuals in a large population.\n \n P(m)= int s(x)*N(m-x)dx\n \n \"where N is the p. d. f. of phenotypes in the population, and m is its centre of gravity. This measure is a suitable basis of a model of an evolution selecting individuals. It may in principle take even the stroke of the lightning into consideration. In the case N is a Gaussian it is fairly easily proved that the average information (information entropy, disorder, diversity) of a large population may be maximized by Gaussian adaptation - keeping the mean fitness constant - in accordance with recapitulation, the central limit theorem, the Hardy-Weinberg law and the second law of thermodynamics. This is in contrast to Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection.\n \n\n Put that in your hat WW and pray over it.",

He writes that the causes of variations, which he refers to as natural experiments, are independent of natural selection; indeed, he suggests, natural selection may get in the way of evolution. Reid proposes an alternative theory to explain how emergent novelties are generated and under what conditions they can overcome the resistance of natural selection. He suggests that what causes innovative variation causes evolution, and that these phenomena are environmental as well as organismal.\n \n After an extended critique of selectionism, Reid constructs an emergence theory of evolution, first examining the evidence in three causal arenas of emergent evolution: symbiosis/association, evolutionary physiology/behavior, and developmental evolution. Based on this evidence of causation, he proposes some working hypotheses, examining mechanisms and processes common to all three arenas, and arrives at a theoretical framework that accounts for generative mechanisms and emergent qualities. Without selectionism, Reid argues, evolutionary innovation can more easily be integrated into a general thesis. Finally, Reid proposes a biological synthesis of rapid emergent evolutionary phases and the prolonged, dynamically stable, non-evolutionary phases imposed by natural selection. \n \n Your theory is dead.",

Fine and dandy - there are heritble epigenetic effects nothing new. And I would point out the only way you or I know about these effects is via the reductionist paradigm and if all we have learned that way is wrong then so is epigenetics!\n C\n Nobody ever claimed that traits are determined by genes in a straightforward way. That depends on how one defines trait more than anything else. Foe example a surface protein in virus (or a cell) is tightly tied to a gene sequence. But the height of a person or that persons risk for cancer is tied to the functioning of perhaps hundereds of individual genes rather than only one. Even eye color is polygenic. Polydactly is a complex trait involving multiple regulatory genes and their specific timing of expression during development. Big deal as they say, we have known all this for many decades now.\n \n We have also known for many decades that the environment can induce heritable changes tis not only epigenetics where this is known and has been known. Consider the mutation experiments done in the 1930s with X-rays and fruit flies. Classic work on the mutational effects of ionizing radiation. Many chemical mutagens are also known including alkylating agents and oxidants. Nothing new there.\n \n And give the above its clear that the environment does cause genetic variability via mutations and such. To this we can now add epigenetic effects due to alkylation and acylation. Whoope do as they say.\n \n And finally SOME acquired traits can be inherited if they are acquired in particular ways - namely by modifying the genes or their control systems in a permanent way. But of course that does not validate the concept that most acquired traits (which alter only somatic cells not in the reproductive line, or genes which are not in the germ line) are NOT hertiable.\n \n None of this has any impact on the therory of evolution since any source of heritable variability is grist for the evolutionary mill. Indeed one need not postulate specific mechanisms of variability so long as the variations are subject to being inherited. After all Darwin developed the original theory with little or no reference to mechanisms of heritability. Indeed his postulated approch to inheritance was incorrect - but that does not affect the evolutionary process at its core.\n \n In other words you will not achieve a falsification of evolution by introducting a new process of heritable variability!

Embryogenesis JUST HAPPENS! Wow if so then how come you are a human and expect to have human children etc? It just happens! What an outstanding explanation you have come up with. A building falls down - explanation It just happens don't think about it. Someone cleans out your bank account, you say hey man it just happens. You burn down your home, never mind it just happens. You breathe, you metabolize, you think, you get sick, you get well, you get old, you reproduce, you kid has three heads and 1 foot, your green parrot turns red, the sun goes out, the galaxy explodes, the universe contracts, your power goes off, your hair falls out, your wife turns into a warthog, your child dies from smallpox. Never mind don't worry it just happens. \n \n And from this firm and unimpeachable intellectual basis you hope to construct convincing arguments. I suppose that will just happen? Not on your tintype.",
