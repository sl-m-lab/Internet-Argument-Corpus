   "Bloomberg Is Criticized for Arizona Gun Show Scrutiny - NYTimes.com\n \n \nPHOENIX - Arizona's attorney general, Tom Horne, was not amused by the undercover investigation that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City recently conducted at a Phoenix gun show, in which undercover detectives found two gun sellers apparently violating federal law.\n \n Mr. Horne criticized Mr. Bloomberg for not notifying the Arizona State Police in advance of the investigation. \"The fact that no such notification was made indicates this so-called sting is nothing less than a public relations stunt,\" Mr. Horne said in a statement.\n \n He said that the mayor ought to focus on what he called New York City's \"skyrocketing crime rate.\"\n \n \"According to the most recent F.B.I. statistics, violent crime in New York City increased significantly in 2010 compared to data from 2009,\" he said. \"Robbery went up 3.9 percent, forcible rape rose 13.9 percent, aggravated assault increased 8.8 percent and murder rose 12.3 percent. Clearly, the good men and women of the New York City police department have more pressing crimes to investigate than alleged violations at a gun show 2,400 miles away.\"\n \n Aides to the mayor said that private detectives who were former law enforcement officers carried out the video investigations, not current police officers. Jason Post, a Bloomberg aide, also disputed the crime figures issued by Mr. Horne. He said that New York is the safest big city in the nation, safer than Phoenix, according to the per capita rate of major felonies tracked by the F.B.I.\n \n As for whether New York ought to be investigating out-of-state gun shows, Mr. Post said that 90 percent of the guns recovered in crimes in New York City come from out of state.\n \n The investigators participating in the mayor's videotaped episode bought three guns, two of them after telling the Arizona sellers that they probably could not pass a federal background check. Such checks are not required for private sales, but private sellers are forbidden from selling to people they reasonably suspect could not pass a federal background check.\n \n In a third purchase, the undercover investigators bought a Glock pistol like the one used in the Jan. 8 Tucson shooting. That purchase was legal, the mayor's aides said, but was intended to show how easy it was to acquire such a gun with no background check.\n \n The operators of the Crossroads of the West gun show, held on Jan. 23 in Phoenix, was also angry at the undercover buys. \"These forays into America's heartland committing blatant acts to entrap otherwise innocent gun owners is an unlawful scheme that is created by Bloomberg's task force,\" the company said in a statement.\n \n Gov. Jan Brewer shrugged off Mr. Bloomberg's investigation to reporters on Monday. \"We believe our laws are fair and just in the state of Arizona,\" she said.\n\n \n So once again we've got Bloomberg sticking his nose where it doesn't belong, overstepping his mayoral authority that ends at the borders of New York City, carrying out a personal crusade, acting like he's in law enforcement, possibly jeapordizing official police investigations in the process, failing to notify the officials of what he intended to do, and what does he find? Two lone individuals out of possibly hundreds who might have done something wrong.\n \n I think the Arizona Attorney General should be looking into filing charges against Bloomberg and his illegal undercover agents.",

That demand is fueling the gun trade he says it going on. Perhaps he should look into eliminating the demand rather than going after one source of the supply.\n \n \n\"In 2009, the City turned over all of its investigative materials on illegal sales to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives (ATF). One of the sellers caught on tape at the Big Reno gun show, Robert Daly, was the subject of an ATF search warrant in July 2010. When the warrant was executed at Daly&#8217;s home in Mesa, Arizona, ATF agents seized 799 guns. The Justice Department has charged him with illegally selling these guns at gun shows.\"\n Mayor Bloomberg Announces Results of Undercover Investigation into Firearms Sales at Arizona Gun Show\n\n \n I'll believe it when I see it coming from a more credible source.

   "As most people know, the NRA's headquarters are located just outside D.C. in Fairfax, Virginia. However, and although I prosecute gun crimes frequently, there is no red colored hotline phone to the NRA headquarters that I must dial for permission before beginning an investigation or prosecution of any crime involving firearms. I do, however, strongly approve of the role the NRA played in helping pass legislation in 1995 that greatly strengthened the penalties for firearm related violent crimes. I would encourage Mr. Bloomberg to explore the possibility of working with the NRA to enact similar laws that target violent crime in his jurisdiction. The NRA has strongly supported the efforts of Virginia's law enforcement community to fight violent crime over the years, and I have no doubt that the organization can provide the same assistance in New York. \n \n In Virginia, every buyer from a FFL dealer must complete the transaction forms and pass the background check. There are no exceptions, and federal law requires the dealers to keep these forms for annual inspection. \n In addition to the federal law regarding background checks, Virginia has a separate background check and straw purchase prohibition statute has been around for quite some time, and over the years it has been revised as new issues arise. The full text of the current code section can be found here:\n \n LIS < Code of Virginia < 18.2-308.2:2 \n \n The 2007 amendment added the following language to the code section:\n \n  L1. Any person who attempts to solicit, persuade, encourage, or entice any dealer to transfer or otherwise convey a firearm other than to the actual buyer, as well as any other person who willfully and intentionally aids or abets such person, shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. This subsection shall not apply to a federal law-enforcement officer or a law-enforcement officer as defined in \u00a7 9.1-101, in the performance of his official duties, or other person under his direct supervision.\n And:\n \n \"Actual buyer\" means a person who executes the consent form required in subsection B or C, or other such firearm transaction records as may be required by federal law.\n \n Before the statute was amended an otherwise qualified buyer's crime consisted of actually obtaining the firearm with the intent to provide it to another who is prohibited. The 2007 change in Virginia's law was intended to prohibit any attempt by any person (other than legitimate controlled law enforcement investigations) to conspire with gun dealers to knowingly violate the background check requirements. This, in fact, is what Bloomberg hired people to try and do in Virginia. \n \n The amendment was strongly supported by the Attorney General of the time and now Governor Robert McDonnell, a Republican. The law was passed, however, with broad bipartisan support, and was signed into law by Governor Tim Kaine, a Democrat, whom some of you may have heard of from his service as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, his reported strong friendship with the President and his time spent in the media spotlight as a short list candidate for vice president. The change in the law is the result of a great deal of bi-partisan anger in Virginia at Mayor Bloomberg for his activities and his complete unwillingness to notify, work with, or even share information after the fact with local law enforcement. The NRA's influence was not needed to effect his change in the law. I am personally aware that the law enforcement community strongly lobbied for it as a reaction to Bloomberg's activities.",

Folks are pretty up in arms today about this book by Philip Greaves about how to be a better - i.e., slightly less molesty - pedophile. According to TechCrunch, The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure is the 158,221st best-selling book on the Kindle, hopefully because of the low $4.79 price and not because of the content. \n The Pedophile's Guide To Love And Pleasure [PIC]\n \n So no right is absolute. If books can be banned then guns can be banned.\n\n \n Oh where to begin?\n \n First and foremost Amazon.com is a business entity. To stay in business such an entity must respond to the feedback of the clients that actually buy and sell with them. If they choose to offend their clientele they risk committing economic suicide and dooming their name to the realm of unemployment. Amazon.com removing this book from their available reading had nothing to do with political motivation and everything to do with protecting themselves against potential boycotts and the loss of who knows how much money in response to their hosting something the public finds distasteful. It's no different than enacting a \"no religious holiday celebrations\" policy at a company workplace for the sake of remaining neutral and avoiding lawsuits.\n \n Remember Amazon.com originally defended the sale of the book, saying that choosing not to sell certain books because of ideals they contained was censorship. It was only after the threat of boycotts appeared that they caved and removed it.\n \n Secondly the book in question wasn't banned. To the best of my knowledge no law was passed that outlawed the sale or possession of this book no matter how distasteful it might be. There are a great deal many other books being sold on Amazon.com that date back to times of questionable treatment of minorities and they're still sold freely. These are books that openly discriminate against blacks and indians and chinese and talk about their killings by members of the KKK but they haven't been removed.\n \n Third is the fact that in Heller and McDonald the Supreme Court asserted that gun ownership is a constitutionally recognized and protected individual right. That means you can't just ban whatever you want whenever you want for whatever reason you want. Gun bans are no longer an acceptable piece of legislation that can be proposed as an answer in search of a problem. Simply because a right isn't unlimited is no reason to assume that's a free pass to restrict it to whatever degree you can imagine. \n \n In comparative terms your hatred for the Second Amendment would be like another calling for the First Amendment to offer no protection for any message that might offend somebody.",
