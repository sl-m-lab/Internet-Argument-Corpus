I know you'll deny this, but that doesn't mean it isn't true. Especially since it's exactly what we see being done in reality by this small but very militant minority.\n In Their Own Words\n \n What you are about to read is just a quick, though disturbing, glance behind the homosexual lobby&#8217;s lavender curtain.\n \n Below are two of the central demands put forth by homosexual activists in their &#8220;1972 Gay Rights Platform&#8221;:\n \n &#8226; &#8220;Repeal all laws governing the age of sexual consent.&#8221; (This should send a chill down the spine of any parent. It would legally allow pedophiles, and homosexuals who were so inclined, to access your children and teens for their own predatory sexual gratification &#8212; so long as those children &#8220;consented&#8221; to having sex.)\n \n &#8226; &#8220;Repeal all legislative provisions that restrict the sex or number of persons entering into a marriage unit.&#8221; (Once marriage is redefined, there can be no logical or ethical objection to any conceivable &#8220;marriage&#8221; combination, including polygamous &#8220;marriages.&#8221; By watering down marriage, &#8220;gay&#8221; activists and like-minded politicos [usually activist judges] remove this foundational institution&#8217;s intrinsic value.)\n \n Here are just a few of the demands the homosexual lobby put forth during the 1987 (Homosexual) &#8220;March on Washington&#8221;:\n \n &#8226; &#8220;The government should provide protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, public accommodations and education just as protection is provided on race, creed, color, sex, or national origin.&#8221; ([ENDA] This would force all religious business owners, landlords and schools to abandon &#8212; under penalty of law &#8212; sincerely held and constitutionally protected religious beliefs and adopt a view of sexual morality that runs entirely counter to central teachings of every major world religion.)\n \n &#8226; &#8220;Anti-homophobic curriculum in the schools.&#8221; (Translation: pro-homosexual, government-mandated indoctrination. This is already occurring in thousands of public schools throughout America. Children are being force-fed the absurd notion that male-male anal sodomy is a perfectly acceptable, &#8220;alternative&#8221; sexual &#8220;orientation.&#8221; This calculated propaganda continues to expand, despite the fact that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has acknowledged that such behaviors place participants at extremely high risk for dangerous and often deadly infectious disease.)\n \n &#8226; &#8220;The government should ensure all public education programs include programs designed to combat lesbian/gay prejudice. &#8230; Institutions that discriminate against lesbian and gay people should be denied tax-exempt status and federal funding.&#8221; (This means churches, religious schools and religious businesses. Some jurisdictions, such as the state of New Jersey, have already begun removing tax-exempt status from church related ministries that refuse to provide &#8220;commitment ceremonies&#8221; to homosexuals.)\n \n &#8226; &#8220;Public and private institutions should support parenting by lesbian or gay couples.&#8221; (This is now being mandated in many states such as California and Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, Catholic Charities&#8217; adoption service was recently forced to close down because it refused to assign children to homosexuals for adoption.)\n \n The push for federal &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; legislation is another activist tool intended to silence traditional views on human sexuality and sexual morality. Similar laws have already been used around the world, and even right here at home, to persecute Christians and other traditionalists. For example, in 2004, 11 Christians were arrested in Philadelphia and charged with a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; for merely preaching the Bible at a public homosexual street festival. They could have served up to 47 years in prison.\n \n More recently, a Christian photographer was dragged before the New Mexico Human Rights Division for refusing to photograph a &#8220;commitment ceremony&#8221; for a lesbian couple because lesbian behavior is inconsistent with Christianity.\n \n Such stark examples of homofascist persecution continue to mount. And they&#8217;re by design. Noted homosexual activist and pornographer Clinton Fein addressed the &#8220;gay&#8221; agenda in a 2005 article candidly titled, &#8220;The Gay Agenda&#8221;:\n \n &#8226; On &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; laws: &#8220;Hate Crime laws are just the beginning. Once those are passed either federally or in all 50 states, begin campaign to eliminate homophobia entirely.&#8221;\n \n &#8226; On &#8220;hate thoughts&#8221; and &#8220;hate speech&#8221; laws: &#8220;Homophobic inclinations alone, even without any actions, should be criminal and punishable to the full extent of the law.&#8221;\n \n &#8226; On influencing public policy: &#8220;Make sure that gay representation permeates every level of governance.&#8221;\n \n &#8226; On &#8220;same-sex marriage&#8221;: &#8220;Demand the institution and then wreck it. James Dobson was right about our evil intentions. We just plan to be quicker than he thought.&#8221;\n \n &#8226; On &#8220;gays&#8221; in the Church: &#8220;Reclaim Jesus. He was a Jewish XXXXX to begin with, and don&#8217;t let anyone forget it.&#8221;\n \n The homosexual lobby&#8217;s goals have been clearly defined for decades. But for any goal to be successfully achieved, clever stratagem and sound methodology must be diligently applied.\n \n In their manuscript, After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the 90&#8217;s (1989, Doubleday/Bantam), Harvard educated marketing experts Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen meticulously laid out the homosexual lobby&#8217;s blueprint for success in what is widely regarded as the handbook for the &#8220;gay&#8221; agenda.\n \n They devised a three-pronged approach that the homosexual lobby has masterfully implemented in subsequent years: Desensitization, Jamming and Conversion.\n \n Kirk and Madsen summarized their approach this way:\n \n &#8226; Portray gays as victims, not as aggressive challengers.\n \n &#8226; Give potential protectors a just cause.\n \n &#8226; Make gays look good.\n \n &#8226; Make victimizers look bad.\n \n Desensitization\n \n &#8220;Desensitization,&#8221; wrote Kirk and Madsen, means subjecting the public to a &#8220;continuous flood of gay-related advertising, presented in the least offensive fashion possible. If &#8216;straights&#8217; can&#8217;t shut off the shower, they may at least eventually get used to being wet.&#8221;\n \n As previously stated, glamorizing and normalizing homosexual conduct in our public schools is a full time endeavor. But the schools represent only one field of battle in the war over America&#8217;s body, mind and soul.

James Dobson was right about our evil intentions. We just plan to be quicker than he thought.\"\n \n \u0095 On \"gays\" in the Church: \"Reclaim Jesus. He was a Jewish XXXXX to begin with, and don't let anyone forget it.\"\n \n The homosexual lobby's goals have been clearly defined for decades. But for any goal to be successfully achieved, clever stratagem and sound methodology must be diligently applied.\n \n In their manuscript, After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the 90's (1989, Doubleday/Bantam), Harvard educated marketing experts Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen meticulously laid out the homosexual lobby's blueprint for success in what is widely regarded as the handbook for the \"gay\" agenda.\n \n They devised a three-pronged approach that the homosexual lobby has masterfully implemented in subsequent years: Desensitization, Jamming and Conversion.\n \n Kirk and Madsen summarized their approach this way:\n \n \u0095 Portray gays as victims, not as aggressive challengers.\n \n \u0095 Give potential protectors a just cause.\n \n \u0095 Make gays look good.\n \n \u0095 Make victimizers look bad.\n \n Desensitization\n \n \"Desensitization,\" wrote Kirk and Madsen, means subjecting the public to a \"continuous flood of gay-related advertising, presented in the least offensive fashion possible. If 'straights' can't shut off the shower, they may at least eventually get used to being wet.\"\n \n As previously stated, glamorizing and normalizing homosexual conduct in our public schools is a full time endeavor. But the schools represent only one field of battle in the war over America's body, mind and soul. Continued...1 2\n | Full Article & Comments | Next <\n \n http://www.townhall.com/columnists/MattBarber/2008/02/13/unmasking_the_\"gay\"_agenda\n\n \n \n So basically all you have done is saying that since we want equality as humans which is in the constitution, and for young adults to have a clear view of sexual orientation and to be aware of safe sex and the reality of STD's HIV and AIDS, and the further awareness of discrimination in the community towards others is bad? \n \n I could say that certain persons under the persona and view of religion has done far worse. I can list a few examples. The slaughter of thousands in the name of the christian god citied and endorced by the pop in the crusades. \n \n The slaughter of over 3000 innocent Americans in the name of Allah or god on 9/11.\n \n show me an incident where a group of gay or lesbian people have murdered in the name of equality and rights. Show me one please! You think that because your not comfortable with my sexuality and nervous because it's something you cannot understand cause your logic is based in ancient texts and cannot see the modern world as it is today. Wake up call: you can't protect or isolate your kids from outside influence. Sorry to say but life is not leave it to beaver! You have to raise your kids to be self sufficient affluent adults and if they want to reject religion and be gay or lesbian that is THEIR choice not yours! Free will remember? All we ask is to have the same basic freedoms others take for granted everyday free of abuse slander or hatred.",

   "well drugs is used as an escape for a problem. religion justifies a way to solve a problem or to put something in front of it to mask the problem or filter it into a new light in a sense.\n\n \n The main reason drugs are considered illegal is because they are chemically addictive and because they are personally harmful. They are a substance, and they get banned because of substance abuse. Religion is the realm of ideas and ideology. I think comparing it to drugs is something that some people who don't like religion may like to do, but it's it's a little silly, frankly. You might as well be comparing just about anything in the realm of ideas and ideology to drugs. It's like comparing patriotism to drugs. Can people take patriotism too far? Well, sure.

Comparing such things to \"drugs\" is so broad it doesn't really have much value--it strikes me as a rather arbitrary comparison.\n \n \nI dont think anyone should be killed for their views unless their views were hurting others and turning persons into mindless sheep. Just like the Nazis or radical Muslims using god as a justification for slaughtering thousands because they didnt agree with their point of view or their way.

   "You see your point of view is justified on your beliefs of your god. There are many other gods that people believe in such as the hindu god or other religions throughout history which is based upon point of view of the person and how they are raised and in what type of environment.\n\n \n There are thousands of other man made religions Jason, and each of them represent some philosophy that their followers embrace and that fits with their comfort zones. And then there's Jesus, who requires us to willingly abandon our free will in favor of trusting the one true God and our creator with our lives. He doesn't compromise with mans value systems as the cults do but insists that as God He is the epitome of all truth and as He puts it in His own words,\n Matthew 11:28 \"Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Matthew 11:29 \"Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and YOU WILL FIND REST FOR YOUR SOULS. 30 \"For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.\"\n \n John 10:9 \"I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture. 10 \"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.\n \nI was raised christian and went to church and did everything. I became attracted to men at a very young age and my first sexual experience was with a classmate in the 8th grade. From then until recently I hid I bottled up the emotions tried to hide them and prayed and asked god why do I fell this way and to make it go away out of fear and doubt and rejection from my family and friends. It got so bad to the point of sucide and depression which most young gay men are dealing with these feelings. It's very trying and very taxing on someone who tries to be understood for who they are. \n\n \n Let me ask you to consider this jason. At the time that you describe above, nobody else except the kid from the 8th grade you experimented with, or maybe a trusted friend knew you were feeling these attractions to men, right? Am I reading you correctly, here? And before you shared with your best friend of 12 years you were feeling this guilt and these suicidal feelings? My point is that when you felt the incredible guilt and conviction about how wrong these feelings were, your guilt and self condemnation was coming from within yourself and not from anyone outside of yourself.\n \n What you were experiencing at that time was a spiritual battle for your soul. It was the enemy telling you that you weren't good enough so just kill yourself. But know that God loves \"you\" and is there within you to see you through anything if you'll only trust Him with your life. It's all or nothing with God. You either love Him or Hate Him; you're either for Him or against Him. There is no compromise, but in Him is total and complete victory.\n \n \n I stopped beating myself out and decided to live my life for me. \n\n Do you see the crux of what you're saying here? You are now living this life for yourself jason. For this flesh and the dead end that that leads to? One of the great secrets of life IN THIS WORLD is that our lives are not our own to just squander as if our flesh has any lasting value past its natural life expectancy at all. We are eternal beings and this life is our proving ground that will determine if we seek to follow the truth or the lie. \n \n God created us for fellowship, but it must be freely given and not forced which is why He will pull at us and call to us, but will never force us to love Him or to respond to His sacrifice that Jesus made for us so willingly. It must be by our free will that we respond to His love. If homosexuality was right and normal, you never would have felt all of that incredible guilt growing up. It's like when a kid is raised in a family that ski's, but he secretly has a love for skating. He doesn't feel guilty for breaking from the family's traditional sport, but empowered because even though it's different, it is seen as normal and healthy. No matter how you slice it, every kid struggles with their homosexual desires and must first go through the process of hardening their heart before they can accept what they are choosing to become. Don't harden your heart jason. \n \n \n It's odd because I talked to my best friend of 12 years and came out to him and gues what? hes a \"christian\" but he said because I'm gay im going to be the cuas eof my moms suicide im going to contract HIV or AIDS, I'm not \"normal\" oh and lets see what else he thinks I have a mental illness. And he shares the same views as you except he you know steals does alcohol smokes etc but thats his deal. But I find it quite sad that he can point and judge me and say such harmful things when hes living a non christian life.\n\n \n Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you and your friend pretty young at the time? I don't assume that as an excuse, but as a reason for why he was so unable to understand what you were feeling internally. It sounds like he was focussing on the physical repercussions of acting on homosexuality rather than the spiritual solutions for it. And as for his personal sins, let that be a lesson to you that christians aren't perfect, only forgiven. So don't ever believe that you're not good enough to be loved by or accepted by our heavenly Father because even believers who have submitted to Gods authority still struggle with sin. Let me encourage you with a passage written by the Apostle Paul about his own struggle with personal sin. Romans 7:14-24 very clearly speaks to the nature of the sin and the struggle that even he contended with to the point that verse 24 that he curses his own body of death. Rom 7:24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? His frustration is palpable in his inability to avoid sinning against the God he loves so much and wants to edify rather than sin against. So don't beat yourself up or feel worthless as we all feel that same inability to act as God would have us act in this flesh. The important thing in the end will be, did we try? Or did we just live for ourselves?\n \n He understands our sinful nature better than we do and loves us in spite of it; \"all of us equally\". For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, not one is worthy, not even one. And yet He freely died on the cross for our sins. Let's forget your proclaimed homosexuality for a minute and make believe that your predominant sin was that you were introduced to rainbow parties where kids took ecstasy and then had group sex at a young age. And from participating in these since the age of 13, you were now addicted to sexual gratification at 20 yrs old and it was escalating to more extreme sexual encounters which was leading to incredible guilt and conviction that you now saw women only as objects rather than people with feelings and value as equals. Sex now controlled your thoughts and because of this you felt worthless and so obsessed and distracted by this unnatural desire for sexual gratification that you have considered suicide.\n \n If that were the case jason, I would be sharing the same gospel with you. Nothing about our spiritual needs change if our predominant sin is founded in hetero or homosexual sex in any way. Our God doesn't care what our sin is, He can and will rescue us from our rebellion if we will only trust Him with our lives. So that is the bottom line for all of us, no matter what our sin is. The only question will be, did we surrender our will to Him and trust Him to remake us in His perfect and holy image? That of course, is a lifetime project, but that is what having a personal relationship with our heavenly father is all about. \n \n So although I'm constantly accused of having some imaginary vendetta against gay people, my problem is with the unrepentant proclamations by gays that for the bible and christians to unreservedly condemn homosexuality as wrong is to be evidence that we are bigoted homophobes, is nothing more than a defense mechanism designed to focus their condemnation on the truth we speak rather than looking within themselves at what they are doing to themselves by following the lusts of the flesh rather than trusting a perfect and loving God to heal them, just as He healed me of my sins of the flesh when I accepted Him and trusted Him with my life.

   "In the United States, people are free to practice and to express openly their religious faith. That's a huge freedom. But being free to practice one's faith means that other religious groups are also free to practice and express their faith, and people of no religion are free to be free from religion. The right to freedom of religion means that no one religious group or faith can impose its religious doctrines on everyone else through laws that violate the freedoms of others.\n \n In colonial America, the Baptists were some of the strongest proponents of religious liberty, as they challenged the authority and hegemony of the established churches in the colonies, such as the Anglican Church in Virginia. Methodists likewise offered a challenge to the established churches. The freedom that people of these faiths sought and won in Virginia and in the new nation with the first amendment meant that other faiths and religious groups as well were to have the same freedoms as the Baptists and Methodists. \n \n One of the burning questions before us now is whether people of certain faiths can impose their beliefs about who should have the right to marry whom on all of the people, purely because of their religious beliefs. The marriage cases that come before the various courts will probably never be argued on the basis of religious liberty. But religious liberty is at the heart of the issue nonetheless. \n \n Do people of certain faiths, who may be in the majority, have the right through majority vote to deny people of other faiths, who are in the minority, the right to marry whom they choose simply because the marriages in question contradict the religious beliefs of the majority? In 1967, when the majority opposed inter-racial marriage, largely out of religious belief, the U.S. Supreme Court said that the majority could not deny inter-racial couples the right to marry. The case was not argued on the basis of the first amendment, but the question of freedom of religion was always in the background. Church leaders had long argued that \"miscegenation\" was against the Bible and was therefore un-Christian. \n \n This same question forms the background for the same-sex marriage cases. And as attitudes about same-sex marriage change, and more people reject the belief that same-sex marriage is a \"sin,\" the people who seek to impose this view on everyone through legal restrictions become less of a majority, and even a minority in some places. \n \n That's why debate and dialogue over the issue of same-sex marriage is so important within the various churches. The more that supporters of marriage equality can break the consensus within the churches that same-sex marriage is a \"sin,\" the weaker the voices become of those who oppose same-sex marriages. They come to be more and more as the proponents of a minority religious position rather than the majority. And while the first amendment should protect people of minority religious views against the denial of religious and other forms of liberty by the majority, in a practical sense, we are more likely to win when the majority supports us rather than stands against us. We are heading in that direction, I think, more rapidly in some states than in others, but generally in that direction. And that is a positive thing for everyone.",

No matter how you slice it, every kid struggles with their homosexual desires and must first go through the process of hardening their heart before they can accept what they are choosing to become. Don't harden your heart jason. \n \n \n \n Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you and your friend pretty young at the time? I don't assume that as an excuse, but as a reason for why he was so unable to understand what you were feeling internally. It sounds like he was focussing on the physical repercussions of acting on homosexuality rather than the spiritual solutions for it. And as for his personal sins, let that be a lesson to you that christians aren't perfect, only forgiven. So don't ever believe that you're not good enough to be loved by or accepted by our heavenly Father because even believers who have submitted to Gods authority still struggle with sin. Let me encourage you with a passage written by the Apostle Paul about his own struggle with personal sin. Romans 7:14-24 very clearly speaks to the nature of the sin and the struggle that even he contended with to the point that verse 24 that he curses his own body of death. Rom 7:24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? His frustration is palpable in his inability to avoid sinning against the God he loves so much and wants to edify rather than sin against. So don't beat yourself up or feel worthless as we all feel that same inability to act as God would have us act in this flesh. The important thing in the end will be, did we try? Or did we just live for ourselves?\n \n He understands our sinful nature better than we do and loves us in spite of it; \"all of us equally\". For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, not one is worthy, not even one. And yet He freely died on the cross for our sins. Let's forget your proclaimed homosexuality for a minute and make believe that your predominant sin was that you were introduced to rainbow parties where kids took ecstasy and then had group sex at a young age. And from participating in these since the age of 13, you were now addicted to sexual gratification at 20 yrs old and it was escalating to more extreme sexual encounters which was leading to incredible guilt and conviction that you now saw women only as objects rather than people with feelings and value as equals. Sex now controlled your thoughts and because of this you felt worthless and so obsessed and distracted by this unnatural desire for sexual gratification that you have considered suicide.\n \n If that were the case jason, I would be sharing the same gospel with you. Nothing about our spiritual needs change if our predominant sin is founded in hetero or homosexual sex in any way. Our God doesn't care what our sin is, He can and will rescue us from our rebellion if we will only trust Him with our lives. So that is the bottom line for all of us, no matter what our sin is. The only question will be, did we surrender our will to Him and trust Him to remake us in His perfect and holy image? That of course, is a lifetime project, but that is what having a personal relationship with our heavenly father is all about. \n \n So although I'm constantly accused of having some imaginary vendetta against gay people, my problem is with the unrepentant proclamations by gays that for the bible and christians to unreservedly condemn homosexuality as wrong is to be evidence that we are bigoted homophobes, is nothing more than a defense mechanism designed to focus their condemnation on the truth we speak rather than looking within themselves at what they are doing to themselves by following the lusts of the flesh rather than trusting a perfect and loving God to heal them, just as He healed me of my sins of the flesh when I accepted Him and trusted Him with my life. Seleh...\n\n \n \n Christianity is a man made religion as well. It was written by man preached by man and followed by man. Even if it is inspired by god it is still in fact practiced and interpeted by man in many various denominations. \n \n I was guilty because I didnt know how to deal with my sexuality and I thought I was worthless because I was gay. I came fully out to my friend only two days ago. He had no idea and no it wasnt with just with the classmate in 8th grade.\n \n No the guilt didnt stem from my actions it was stemmed from rejection from my family and friends. I knew deep down that if god truely loved me he would accept me for who I am. If his love is truely infinite and if he created my attraction towards men then it is perfectly ok.\n \n Point in case I love myself god loves me for who I am and I'm not ashamed.",

   "Anyone who disagrees with the militant gay agenda you endorse is seen as you are seeking to paint me jito. What I marvel at is that you are blind to your own obvious anti-christian hatred and bigotry. Morally speaking, you are on the wrong side of this issue, but you can't even see it. \n \n And your comparison of me with Phelps is not only shallow, but an obvious lie because he preaches that God hates gays, where as I constantly teach that God loves them. What I don't compromise with, is that He will accept them as unrepentant sinners just as He didn't accept me as an unrepentant sinner. We all must turn away from our sins of the flesh whether gay or straight in order to receive the gift of salvation. That concept seems beyond you to grasp.\n \n So go ahead and live like gays deserve some special dispensation that allows them to practice that which God considers an abomination as you blame and condemn people like me for telling you the truth. See how far it gets you, and see if in the end it was truly love that you were showing them as you realize you only enabled their destruction, and your own also with your perceived tolerance.\n\n \n WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHH. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Man, I wish there was an emoticon to demonstrate how hard I am laughing.",
