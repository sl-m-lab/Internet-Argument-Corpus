Productivity growth in the United States had declined to an average annual rate of 1 percent, compared to 3.2 percent of the 1960s. There was also a growing federal budget deficit which increased to 66 billion dollars. The 1970s are described as a period of stagflation, meaning economic stagnation coupled with price inflation, as well as higher interest rates. Price inflation (a rise in the general level of prices) creates uncertainty in budgeting and planning and makes labor strikes for pay raises more likely.\n In the wake of a cabinet shakeup in which Carter asked for the resignations of several cabinet members (see \"Malaise speech\" below), Carter appointed G. William Miller as Secretary of the Treasury. Miller had been serving as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. To replace Miller, and in order to calm down the market, Carter appointed Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board[27]. Volcker pursued a tight monetary policy to bring down inflation, which he considered his mandate. He succeeded, but only by first going through an unpleasant phase during which the economy slowed and unemployment rose, prior to any relief from inflation.\n Lead by Volcker, the Federal Reserve raised the discount rate from 10% when Volcker assumed the chairmanship in August 1979 to 12% within two months [28]. The prime rate hit 21.5% in December 1980, the highest rate in U.S. history under any President.[29] Investments in fixed income (both bonds and pensions being paid to retired people) were becoming less valuable. The high interest rates would lead to a sharp recession in the early 1980s[30]\n And here's evidence that everything you and child have said is just so much ignorant drivel. \n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu5ulFLpHMkIAWt9XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTFhM2Q3ZHNjBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNgRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkA1BSMDIwXzEyOARsA1dTMQ--/SIG=11siher61/EXP=1203463717/**http%3a//mwhodges.home.att.net/1980-88.htm\n The 'REAGAN ERA' was revolutionary, AND an instructive pointer for the future\n \n The first era in 50 years that the private sector share of the economy was not reduced by government expanding its share of the economic pie faster than economic growth. In fact, government's share was reduced for the first time.\n \n Federal social spending ratios stopped rising, and fell, for the first time in over 3 decades.\n \n The early 1980s was the first interruption in the rapid up-swing of federal regulatory activity spending in 2 decades. In fact, during the 1980s, said spending declined in real terms - - only to resume its fast upward pace in the 1990s.\n \n Taxes were reduced by large amounts, and the economy expanded together with a new climate of competition and regulatory burden reductions.\n A decade of declining real median family income was reversed to the upside.\n \n Double digit inflation and interest rates were eliminated.\n \n Debt increased due to lack of congressional spending cuts following tax cut approval, but debt ratios were higher 9 years later.\n \n International terrorism was faced head-on.\n \n The Evil Empire was brought to its knees, without increasing the defense spending ratio, ending a 40-year cold war.\n \n A 2-decade slide in voter turnout and citizen trust in government was reversed, only to collapse to new lows in the 1990s.",

First about the damage Carter did with a Democratic majority, tax and spend Congress, and then about how Reagan turned that economy around with basically the same tax and spend Congress. To anyone with half a brain, that is solid evidence that it was Reagan's economic policies that made the difference. \n \n \nYou don't even have any arguments against my except more insults. Not that your behavior surprises me....\n\n \n I repost the one from above as evidence that I have posted a lot more substance to support my arguments than you have here. And I quote this line of yours to show that by your claim that all I will do is attack you with more insults, it is once again you who is attacking me with more insults. Does the word hypocrite mean anything to you? I thought not.\n \n \nDo you actually have a argument or are you going to keep ignoring my points?\n\n \n (It's \"Do you actually have AN argument\") you self declared genius, for the 50th time. And I've answered more than you deserve since you completely ignored my evidence because as usual you always hate and reject the truth out of hand. Here's the evidence that is historically correct that you so completely ignored as you insisted your are right yet again in spite of the facts.\n \n [Archangel] You, along with child obviously have serious issues with your memories then samiinh.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter#Economy:_stagflation_and_the_appointment_of_Volcker\n Economy: stagflation and the appointment of Volcker\n During Carter's administration, the economy suffered double-digit inflation, coupled with very high interest rates, oil shortages, high unemployment and slow economic growth. Productivity growth in the United States had declined to an average annual rate of 1 percent, compared to 3.2 percent of the 1960s. There was also a growing federal budget deficit which increased to 66 billion dollars. The 1970s are described as a period of stagflation, meaning economic stagnation coupled with price inflation, as well as higher interest rates. Price inflation (a rise in the general level of prices) creates uncertainty in budgeting and planning and makes labor strikes for pay raises more likely.\n In the wake of a cabinet shakeup in which Carter asked for the resignations of several cabinet members (see \"Malaise speech\" below), Carter appointed G. William Miller as Secretary of the Treasury. Miller had been serving as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. To replace Miller, and in order to calm down the market, Carter appointed Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board[27]. Volcker pursued a tight monetary policy to bring down inflation, which he considered his mandate. He succeeded, but only by first going through an unpleasant phase during which the economy slowed and unemployment rose, prior to any relief from inflation.\n Lead by Volcker, the Federal Reserve raised the discount rate from 10% when Volcker assumed the chairmanship in August 1979 to 12% within two months [28]. The prime rate hit 21.5% in December 1980, the highest rate in U.S. history under any President.[29] Investments in fixed income (both bonds and pensions being paid to retired people) were becoming less valuable. The high interest rates would lead to a sharp recession in the early 1980s[30]\n And here's evidence that everything you and child have said is just so much ignorant drivel. \n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu5ulFLpHMkIAWt9XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTFhM2Q3ZHNjBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNgRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkA1BSMDIwXzEyOARsA1dTMQ--/SIG=11siher61/EXP=1203463717/**http%3a//mwhodges.home.att.net/1980-88.htm\n The 'REAGAN ERA' was revolutionary, AND an instructive pointer for the future\n \n The first era in 50 years that the private sector share of the economy was not reduced by government expanding its share of the economic pie faster than economic growth. In fact, government's share was reduced for the first time.\n \n Federal social spending ratios stopped rising, and fell, for the first time in over 3 decades.\n \n The early 1980s was the first interruption in the rapid up-swing of federal regulatory activity spending in 2 decades. In fact, during the 1980s, said spending declined in real terms - - only to resume its fast upward pace in the 1990s.\n \n Taxes were reduced by large amounts, and the economy expanded together with a new climate of competition and regulatory burden reductions.\n A decade of declining real median family income was reversed to the upside.\n \n Double digit inflation and interest rates were eliminated.\n \n Debt increased due to lack of congressional spending cuts following tax cut approval, but debt ratios were higher 9 years later.\n \n International terrorism was faced head-on.\n \n The Evil Empire was brought to its knees, without increasing the defense spending ratio, ending a 40-year cold war.\n \n A 2-decade slide in voter turnout and citizen trust in government was reversed, only to collapse to new lows in the 1990s.",

   "I find it quite interesting that it is more desirable to write of Reagan rather than even attempt to justify the actions of the worst president in American history. No one here even wants to tackle it. Interesting. But, I can't blame you. There is no defense for stupid.\n\n I wrote of Bush on my first post, quoted here DrD that said that it is way too early to judge Bush's Presidency until we have some time in which to judge it. I only mentioned Reagan to make the point that the libs also condemned him while he was still in office but history has painted a much more positive picture of him in reality. Yet in spite of the historical and documented evidence of Reagan's positive legacy, those who prefer rewritten history will still lie and deny what is so accepted as the truth. So I didn't bring up Reagan to change the subject as you can see from the post below, but to show that it is way too early to be judging either him, or the long term impact his administration will have on World events. \n \nJust a word of advice DrD, it is usually the practice of historians to wait at least a few years after a President leaves office before judging his impact on History. Of course that didn't stop the dems from calling Reagan a stupid and ignorant cowboy for his policies and the way he dealt with the Soviets and the Cold War, but lo and behold look how history remembers him now, in spite of the shallow and ignorant short sighted perspectives of those pesky pseudo intellectual liberals who so freely attacked and demonized him while he was still in office just as you guys are doing now to Bush. Do I see a pattern here? At least you libs are consistent from generation to generation anyway.\n",

   "Keep insisting that child. Maybe then you can convince yourself that your winning something here. And I notice you have this uncanny skill to just blunder through as you COMPLETELY IGNORE THE TWO LINKS I POSTED WITH EVIDENCE OF WHAT I AM SAYING.\n\n \n Did you even bother to read your own links? One of them cited himself.\n His own links linked to his own website which provided no references!\n \n Repeating the same **** over and over again doesn't make good arguments. \n \n \nit's stupid because it single handedly explains why we had a 21% Prime Interest Rate under the Democrats, and the American people were completely demoralized and weighed down by the Tax burden.\n\n \n Come again? Do you even understand what stagflation is? I see you wish to ignore how you were wrong about the tax brackets. Reagan cut taxes on the highest brackets by 50% and you are clearly wishing to ignore how inflation creep pushed millions of middle class into higher brackets. I can check what you ignored. And I'm not going to let you ignore it. A 21% prime rate comes from a wide variety of issues, many of them outside the US's control. Oil prices for one, which the US has little control over. What the US president DOES have some control over is fiscal policy. And Reagan flooded the economy with billions of dollars without a increase in the value of the assets of the country. Anyone with economics background can tell you what will happen if you do that. \n \n \nThe rich stopped spending money because of the luxury tax AND A LACK OF FAITH IN THE GOVERNMENTS ABILITY TO LEAD, I KNOW FIRST HAND HOW THAT AFFECTED SPENDING. BOATS, VACATION HOMES AND EXPENSIVE CAR SALED DRIED UP.\n\n \n Sure you did. Your argument is right out of the Cult of Reagan. Do you even have your facts right? The Federal government repealed the latest luxury tax in 1993. And the first one was phased out in 1965. What are you talking about? \n \n \nReagan changed all that by getting rid of that tax. He understood that unless the rich bought those items, the middle class wouldn't have the jobs building them.\n\n \n No he didn't. The first luxury tax phased out in '65. Congress repealed another in 1993. No such tax was eliminated during Reagan's years. \n \n \nEven your lie about Reagan bringing on Volker to fix his mess was in fact Carter. So just admit that you tried to blame Reagan for Carters failures.\n\n \n I never stated that Reagan brought on Volcker (please spell his name right) to fix Carter's mistake. You are just lying. I stated that Volcker solved the inflation problem, where Reagan made it worse. Explain to me how flooding the market with billions of currency units doesn't increase inflation. \n \n You attack me for lack of economic education. Let's see if you can take what you dish out. I suspect you can't and you'll run. \n \n \nRegarding your 35% tax rate for the rich? Why didn't you post that people who made under 100,000 paid only 18%, and people with children who made under 35,000 paid nothing.\n\n \n Perhaps you need to again start fact checking. You are wrong as usual. \n \n From 1979- to the end of Reagan, you need to make less then $14,000 with kids not to be taxed. Less then 50% of what you claimed. Wrong as usual AA, start using Google and maybe you'll win a argument for a change? \n \n http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/151.html\n http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=5324&type=0&sequence=0\n \n \nYou scream awfully loud about how smart you are but that in no way means you're smart child. And I posted the evidence that proves that your stagflation was caused by Carter, not Reagan.\n\n \n No, you posted a site that cites itself in every link and doesn't cite sources. Besides, I never stated that Reagan caused stagflation, (you're lying again) only that prolonged it, where Volcker was trying to fight it to the point where Volcker caused a artificial recession. \n \n \nSo the complete misery index you have ignorantly tried to lay at Reagans feet, really belonged to your democratic hero Jimmy Carter, the Peanut Farmer from Georgia. But of course you completely ignored that REALITY as you continued to call me stupid by inference.\n\n \n Come again? Where did I say anything about Carter? Or it is because you are lying again? Explain to me how adding billions of currency units to a economy doesn't increase inflation. Please, Try, if you can.\n \n \nDon't lie again little child. You know you can't post a link to refute mine because mine tell the truth.\n\n \n Did you really say that?\n \n \"My sources are true because I say so!\"\n \n \nFirst about the damage Carter did with a Democratic majority, tax and spend Congress, and then about how Reagan turned that economy around with basically the same tax and spend Congress. To anyone with half a brain, that is solid evidence that it was Reagan's economic policies that made the difference.\n\n \n I'm going to laugh as Daewoo shreds you to pieces. Anyone with half a brain can figure out that the debt load we got from Reagan, coupled with the insane inflation that he help build damaged the economy and that it was Bush Sr and Clinton who got us out. \n \n Disagree with me? Then you disagree with Alan Greenspan.\n \n Read his book. Then come back. \n \n \nDoes the word hypocrite mean anything to you? I thought not.\n\n \n I have a argument. You don't. Plus you are citing wikipedia despite your hissy fits when it was used against you.\n \n thus you are hypocrite. \n \n \n See above. That's hubris talking. And you will lose here just as you lose everywhere else on this forum.\n \n Did you even look at your own source?\n \n All his links go to his own pages. He's citing HIMSELF in his own pages.\n \n And now you cite wikipedia after you threw tantrums when it was used against you. hypocrite anyone?\n \n Debt under Reagan\n http://zfacts.com/p/318.html\n http://www.slate.com/id/100474/\n \n Come back when you can address points.\n \n And remember, Reagan appeased terrorists in Beruit! He CUT AND RUN.\n \n You COMPLETELY ignored the middle paragraph.\n \n Explain to me how flooding the market with cash fights inflation. Put your money where your mouth is for a change.",

   "There was nothing really radical, extreme or even different about Reagan's economic package steeve. His stimulus package was classic economics in that by cutting taxes, he put more money back into the hands of the American people thereby allowing for more individual spending which stimulated the economy by increasing Manufacturing, which increased hiring, which meant new jobs, which meant more people had disposable income which built a stronger and more robust economy for everyone.\nThe problem is this didn't work. If you reduce taxes to zero you obviously do not generate any income for the government. If you raise taxes to 100% you have no citizens and thus no taxes. The point is that somewhere in the middle is a point where if you tax more you get less. Unfortunately this point has been shown to be rather high and well above the tax levels of the 1980s. The result was a debt funded economy that provided more money for the people but didn't translate to anything meaningful for the government. Get more for less sounds good if you are a politician but it just doesn't work. Basic economy theory has always been the best for a government...if you want $4 you have to tax $4 worth.\n \n \nWhat caused Government waste was the Democratically controlled Congress that hid pet spending projects in Reagan's Bills before passing them.\nThis just isn't the case. In fact, the republicans controlled part of congress in the 80s. Furthermore, it was spending for the Cold War ( a Reagan plan) that caused most of the damage. These little \"pork\" spending issues you hear about are drops in the bucket compared to the real spending.\n \n \nThis was their way of attempting to hijack his very effective economic plan so they could then claim it didn't work. But it was them attempting to make sure it didn't work.\nWishful thinking. This just isn't true. Reagan's plan was unique but doesn't work for out level of government. The proof is in the pudding as they say...we grew into a recession right after Reagan with large amounts of debt and an economy only funded by it.",

It actually STARTED under the NIXON administration, which makes sense since it was mostly nixon taking us off the gold standard that caused it. You need to work on your reading comprehension. You keep posting things as rebuttals that do not necessarily support your position or damage your opponents argument. It is jsut superflous trash. \n \n \n \nWhich you completely ignored because it showed you're full of it. What you do in so many debates without ever even flinching is totally ignore evidence that make a valid point as if it was never even posted. You don't acknowledge it, answer to it, or respond to it in any way. You just go on telling me I'm wrong and ignorant while remaining in your own little world of denial. Why am I even trying to debate with such an insincere debater? :xbanghead I will admit it, that does make me stupid to even try to reason with the likes of a disingenuous person like you.\n\n \n IMO that is becuase often you do not understand what you have posted so you are the only one who sees it as \"evidence\". Msore often than not when you post information as a rebuttal it does not rebut. That leaves your opponent wondering why in the world you are jsut posting random stuff off the internet. You need to either:\n \n A. Be careful to only post things you are certain you understand\n B. Explain when you post things how or why you feel they support your argument. \n \n You might also consider your source and try to determine whether it even makes sense...and check the date on it. For example the article you psoted about Bushs protectionist measures for the steel industry MIGHT have been quasi valid when it was written in 2002. It was dumb then, but at least it was debatable dumb. NOw, 6 years later, it is just mind numbingly dumb. All the #### int eh article has been shot full of holes by history. There is no reason to do it again here. \n \n \nOnly because to deny that Reagan brought the US out of the most serious recession since the Great depression, injected new confidence into the America people and economy and put this Country back to work is a totally stupid and ignorant thing to insist on. This is what you so totally and conveniently have ignored from my prior post.\n\n \n ROTFLMAO. What reagan did was not \"bring the US out of\" anything. What he did was printed our way intot eh illusion of growth. Sadly in the process he transformed our economic problems of the day from \"extremely inconvenient\" to \"certain to destroy the nation\". Now there is an acomplishment.\n \n Frankly the fact that you keep insisting that \"injecting new confidence\" into the economy was a good thing betrays your lack of knowedge in this area. Having confidence in the economy is a good thing if it is justified. Creating the illusion of prosperity and thus causing an increase in confidence is NOT a good thing when your economy contains the kind of structural imbalances that the US economy did. Even Von Mises talked about this. Insulating consumers from economic reality (when that reality is bad) encourages debt acquisition, which invariably results in a debt bubble. What is our biggest problem today?? Oh...yea...a giant debt bubble that is likely to wipe us out. Whoops. \n \n \nThe first era in 50 years that the private sector share of the economy was not reduced by government expanding its share of the economic pie faster than economic growth. In fact, government's share was reduced for the first time.\n\n \n ROTFLMAO. Frot eh first time in the history of this nation we saw corporate welfare. So, Reagan, the fiscal conservative, spurred private sector growht by adoptiong SOCIALISM. \n \n That is something to be proud of. \n \n \n Archie, you need to be careful about using the grandfather economic report. The guy does a GREAT job of compiling figures, but a TERRIBLE job of analysis. He is a staunch Reaganite and admits to being a close adherent of Freidman, whose policies have already been completely discredited. He is not an economist and he has a decidedly one sided view of economics, forged almost entirely of reaganomic ####.",

   "I also showed that stagflation was created under Carters administration. See?\n\n \n That is relevant how? No one was talking about what created Stagflation (and much if it was outside forces that no president can control). What I was talking about was that Reagan's fiscal policies extended it despite Volcker's artificial recession designed to halt inflation. \n \n You called that stupid, factless and ignorant.\n \n Thus I want you to explain how flooding the market with currency doesn't cause inflation to rise since my argument states that such action, taken by Reagan did indeed cause inflation to rise. \n \n I understand that there is a good chance that you don't read or understand what I wrote and responded with a knee jerk reaction, but you failed to admit this after several posts. \n \n \nWhich you completely ignored because it showed you're full of it.\n\n \n or because it is not relevant to what i was talking about and what you called \"stupid\", \"factless\" and \"ignorant.\" Even Steeeve is attacking you on your lack of argument. \n \n \nWhat you do in so many debates without ever even flinching is totally ignore evidence that make a valid point as if it was never even posted. You don't acknowledge it, answer to it, or respond to it in any way.\n\n \n Come again? How are Carter's screw ups (which many of those weren't his fault) related to how Reagan extended the period of Stagflation due to liberal fiscal policies? \n \n Do you understand what extend means? Do I need to hand you a dictionary? \n \n \nYou just go on telling me I'm wrong and ignorant while remaining in your own little world of denial. Why am I even trying to debate with such an insincere debater? :xbanghead I will admit it, that does make me stupid to even try to reason with the likes of a disingenuous person like you.\n\n \n All of which is irrelevant is your attempt to weasel out of defending your attack on my post. Which by the way you haven't backed up and are ignoring how you were wrong on a huge variety of issues ranging from tax rates, repeals of luxury taxes (didn't happen) and who actually fixed the problem.\n \n \nOnly because to deny that Reagan brought the US out of the most serious recession since the Great depression, injected new confidence into the America people and economy and put this Country back to work is a totally stupid and ignorant thing to insist on. This is what you so totally and conveniently have ignored from my prior post.\n\n \n How?\n \n How did Reagan bring us out of stagflation by flooding the market with billions of dollars?\n \n How is it that tightening monetary policy which curtails inflation wasn't the true cause of the end of the period? \n \n Provide some economic analysis for a change instead of factless insults.\n \n Repeating the same links over and over again doesn't make you right. \n \n The point is YOU ARE LYING ABOUT WHAT I SAID YOU SAID AND YOU ARE REFUSING TO BACK UP YOUR CLAIMS\n \n You claimed my argument that Reagan extended stagflation was \"stupid\"\n \n Therefore you believe that my belief that what Reagan did, which was flooding the market with currency which I have argued extended the rise of inflation is wrong. Therefore you must believe that flooding the market with currency has no effect on inflation since you called my belief, which is that it does stupid.\n \n So Explain to me how flooding the market with currency doesn't cause inflation to rise. \n \n If you can.",
