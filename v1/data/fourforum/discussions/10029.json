   "Just found this article, thought I'd share it. It is about the \"zero tolerance\" policies of schools. Here's a link: Backlash against Zero Tolerance grows.\n \n Here are some small snippets of the absurdities caused by the policies: \nFifth-graders in California who adorned their mortarboards with tiny toy plastic soldiers this week to support troops in Iraq were forced to cut off their miniature weapons. A Utah boy was suspended for giving his cousin a cold pill prescribed to both students. In Rhode Island, a kindergartner was suspended for bringing a plastic knife to school so he could cut cookies. \n \n These are some of the most ridiculous things I've seen.\n \n Here's another: \n The principal at Portsmouth High School in Rhode Island - whose mascot is sometimes depicted carrying a rifle - censored a yearbook photo because it showed a student who enjoys medieval reenactments wearing chainmail and holding a sword. \n \n\n \n They banned a picture because he was holding a friggin sword for a medieval reenactment fair? :xcensored \n \n \n Then there is this:\n \nReynolds also questioned what lessons zero-tolerance rules teach, citing reports that a 10-year-old girl was expelled from a Colorado academy after giving a teacher a small knife her mother placed in her lunchbox. \n \n \"What she learned from the school was, 'If something happens and you break a rule, for God's sake, don't tell anybody,\"' Reynolds said. \"Zero-tolerance policies completely ignore the concept of intent, which is antithetical to the American philosophy of justice.\" \n\n I think this really says it all.\n \n Gladly, it looks like the absurdity is moving toward the better: \nLawmakers in several states say the strict policies in schools have resulted in many punishments that lack common sense, and are seeking to loosen the restrictions. \n \n \"A machete is not the same as a butter knife. A water gun is not the same as a gun loaded with bullets,\" said Rhode Island state Sen. Daniel Issa, a former school board member who worries that no-tolerance rules are applied blindly and too rigidly. \n \n Issa sponsored a bill requiring school districts to decide punishments for alcohol, drug and non-firearm weapon violations on a case-by-case basis after weighing the circumstances. It passed the Senate and House and now heads for the governor's desk. \n \n Some have long been aware of the problems of zero tolerance. For the last decade, Mississippi has allowed local school districts to reduce previously mandatory one-year expulsions for violence, weapons and drug offenses. \n \n More recently, Texas lawmakers have also moved to tone down their state's zero-tolerance rules. Utah altered its zero-tolerance policy on drugs so asthmatic students can carry inhalers. The American Bar Association has recommended ending zero-tolerance policies, while the American Psychological Association wants the most draconian codes changed. \n \n",

Many of the articles on this incident fail to note the yearbook's picture guidelines. As a general rule, they don't allow props and costumes because they didn't want to have to pick and choose which props were unacceptable and which ones were alright. It's not a zero-tolerance issue, and the kid wasn't even punished for anything. He sent in a photograph with himself in chain mail, wielding a sword, and the yearbook refused to to put it in under their guidelines. Know what you do then? Send another photo without the chain mail and sword. It's that simple.\n \n \nI also notice that you ignored that the friggin school's MASCOT is often depicted holding a gun. Talk about double standards in that school.\n\n \n They're completely separate issues. Simply because a mascot has a prop does not mean yearbook photos can have props. That can be interpreted other ways too: \"If the mascot has a gun, how come I can't walk around the school with my gun?! This is hypocrisy!\"\n \n \nYou also avoided all of the other cases - do you not have any comment on this other than to talk about your personal yearbook experience?\n\n \n This topic was covered in a \"journalism ethics\" discussion held with my school's yearbook adviser.

The best analogy I can think of is some idiot who builds an engine with zero tolerances in all dimensions. It won't turn over and even if it should it will self-destruct rapidly. Zero-tolerance for engines, drugs in the environment, pesticide residues, aspirins at school, etc etc etc. are unworkable in practice and always produce lousy and silly results. It reminds me of a client I once had who claimed that in HER LABORATORY there was no room for any error - ever. Of course thats absurd, all measurements are in error - its a matter of degree.",
