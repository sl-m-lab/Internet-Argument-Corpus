So often, this debate is phrased in terms of the mother's rights vs those of the fetus, but we often forget (including myself) that other people can also be deeply affected by abortion decisions - including the family which might lose a mother.\n \n I would also generally agree that the doctor can often best say what type of health risk exists. Even there, though, the doctor him/herself would have to have some level of judgement about what level of risk is \"acceptable\" and what isn't. Ultimately, someone has to make that decision.

However, there are cases where this is just not an option. For example, sometimes the mother cannot afford to loose too much blood in such an operation.

However, sometimes, there is just no choice (which is why I brought up the car driving at you scenario). \n \n I am still trying to come up with a scenario that is closer to the health risked pregnancy situation. Perhaps going back to the modified violinist scenario. Re-stating it with this new modification, if someone took you and connected a contraption to you, saying that, in a few months, an unconscious violinist would be attached to it and you would need to keep him alive through this contraption attached to your body for a few more months after that. If you did not disconnect the contraption before he arrived, that would be tantamount to agreeing to the connection. Once he was attached to you, I would call that similar to the moral situation of a third trimester mentally-existing fetus. Now, if suddenly that connection to the violinist ran a high risk of causing you paralysis and no alteration to the aparatus could fix things, would you disconnect - thus causing his death? I think that, for such a very high risk, I probably would - though I would feel awful about it.\n \nAnd in your example she could but the other children up for adoption just as easy. In reality the government does pay a nice amount for disability and things like that so it probably wouldn't be a huge burden...but thats a little off the point.\n\n Yes, you have a point that she does have the option of adopting out the other children, as there would also be the option of having the father do the great majority of the parenting. However, either way, the other children would be affected in a very negative way, which still does make that particular health risk more important than for a pregnant woman with no children that would be affected. I know that these weight factors that help decide in the gray region are not clear cut and black and white. Most difficult decisions where one balances various rights and values are not clear cut. That is why I do not envy the job of judges. If I were in their shoes, I would probably end up often dwelling on whether I had weighed factors correctly. However, a judgement does have to be made and I think that the effect of the mother's health on the well being of her other children should be a factor that is taken into account.",

   "The assumptions were based on worst case scenarios. It could well be that most risks to mother's health could be remedied by alternative methods. Of course, as with any of the examples we give here (driver, etc.), I think ALL other alternatives to killing/abortion should be tried first - alternatives that can sufficiently reduce the risk to the mother's health in order to avoid the need for abortion.

   "The risks are well known by the third trimester.\n\n Just because the risks are known does not mean that you consent to them or that your response to any of those risks coming true would be that you would be the one making a sacrifice. When you walk in a bad neighborhood at night, you run the risk of getting mugged - that risk is well known. That does not mean you consent to be mugged.\n \nLike I said earlier, the risk is assumed. I disagree with the way you approach moral dilemmas as it assumes you to always be correct. It is also hard to say how you would feel in that situation. What if it just caused the person to have one kidney fail? Is that enough...what if there was only a 20% risk of paralysis? What you would want in that situation may be different for everyone and when two people are involved it certainly seems like one is not getting a say in the matter. \n\n Well, I think there are two types of moral rules that one follows - one is ones personal morality and the other is the morality that is imposed on one from an external organization (usually the government via laws). The laws relating to morality that the government imposes are out of my control outside of voting. I am a \"law-abiding citizen\" and believe a responsible person should follow laws not only out of fear of punishment but out of that sense of being part of a civilized society. However, I do occasionally not follow minor laws (speeding is the one that comes to mind) and, if there were a law that went very far from my personal morality, I might consider transgressing that. \n \n Anyway, I have my personal sense of morality where it occasionally relies on stepping back and thinking about how I would feel in the opposite situation and that morality works best for me. I personally don't believe in laws dictated from some religious authorities because I, personally, do not trust those authorities that they are automatically right - especially since many of the laws presented are not fully supported with objective reasons. I trust my own judgement while following the laws imposed by the state.\n \n Are my moral decisions always right? No but I haven't found a better moral approach to follow than the one I do. \n \n As for the original discussion about health risks in a pregnancy and its equivalent in the violinist scenario, when you asked \"What if it just caused the person to have one kidney fail? Is that enough...what if there was only a 20% risk of paralysis? \". That is precisely the type of question I wished to address in this thread since that is the type of gray region where I admittedly did not have a clear answer and was looking for other people's views to ponder. Morally gray regions are always hard to decide on. That does not mean that one has to take one extreme or another in order to avoid that discomfort (ex. never granting the health exception or granting it for any minor health reason). Absolutist positions are easy to describe but that does not make them right. Sometimes, one has to face the moral incertitude of those moral dilemmas.\n \nEven so, would it be unreasonable for the violinist to be upset considering he thought he accepted the risk and thus trusted you with his life and then you turn your back on him when that entire time he could have been trying to find another means of life support. I doubt you would feel that breaking a trust falls under the \"do onto others\" idea.\n\n If there was a specific arrangement made that I would take on every possible negative risk in taking on responsibility over him, then you might have an arguement. Frankly, I would not have taken on the violinist under such an extremely skewed deal. After all, I would have already been doing the violinist a huge favor in taking him on. I personally am not altruistic enough to such strangers to voluntarily take on paralysis or death for their sake as well. If he could find someone else to take on such a one-sided deal, then good luck to him.",
