I was referring to anything that sets itself up as a power and that uses God as its matrix or, more fitting, the things of God as its template.\n \n Most people that &#8220;hate&#8221; God, doesn&#8217;t know Him well enough to love or hate Him, it&#8217;s religion that they hate, and that&#8217;s what I was referring to.
