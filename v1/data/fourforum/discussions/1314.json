But the scientists are arguing from the evidence, not from their religious beliefs.\n \n Does it matter if Toumai is not a direct ancestor of humans? No. It demonstrates that organisms existed at that time that possessed some features which are indicative of human and some which are indicative of ape. This is not surprising if one understands the theory of evolution but impossible to explain for creationism.\n \n Of course the source is playing very loosely with the truth. \"the fossil of an ape\". No one is saying that it is identical to modern extant apes, if it was so it would be immediately identifiable and there would be no controversy. So it might be an ancestor of modern apes. This is interesting because apes have also evolved, they have not remained in their present form over millions of years - something which creationists usually don't understand.\n \n So the incontrovertible story is that a skull has been discovered aged between 6 and 7 million years old which is uniquely different to all extant and extinct species but displays hominid and ape features.\n \n So monty, what's the creationist position on this fossil? Is it an ape fossil or a human fossil or some extinct \"kind\"? Try and give some evidence to support your assertion.\n \n And do you support the other errors and misrepresentations that your unnamed source from the webpage makes?",

This is also the case here where we only have a skull.\n I also point out that DNA cannot be preserved through the fossil record, so we really have no way other than bone structure of identifying/classifying humanoid/ape remains. \n Finally, all dating relies on a constant state of decay (as well as an initial amount of radioactivity in the air). I further add to this that the amount of radioactivity in the air today has changed so much since the amount found in 1950 that all dating methods are based on the radioactivity in the air in 1950. Yet, scientists still assume that there was a constant rate from the first fossil until 1950. \n \n That aside, you ask what do creationists have to say about bones that are discovered that display both human and ape features to them (specifically skulls). Remember that for the longest time, evolutionists felt that people from Africa were more closely related to apes because of their facial structure. Humans like to classify, and we like to find things that are similar to us. :-0 looks like a persons face with his mouth open when it is really a colon, a hyphen, and a zero. This is the reason I believe scientists find skulls that are fossilized with both ape and human features. \n Creationists have also said that since people lived longer, they developed different features. I am not familiar with the research on this, but I believe that it is possible (at least to be researched). \n A final theory is based on the verse that states the &#8220;sons of God were breeding with the daughters of men&#8221;.

If you have research (in book or journal form) that disproves either of the Christian theories, feel free to let me know about it, I will check back from time to time.

Yes, you are right.\n \n \nFirst, I want to point out that no complete humanoid/ape fossils have ever been found. \n\n Really? Do you assert this from your extensive knowledge of the topic? How about  Turkana Boy? Oh, the hands and feet are missing. Does that mean that all of the other anatomical evidence can be ignored for a 1.6 million year old fossil of a different humanoid species? How about Lucy, a 3.6 million year old humanoid fossil of a different Genus?\n \n \nThis is also the case here where we only have a skull.\n\n Duh! Oh, you mean there are no complete fossil skulls. Well there's plenty of near complete skulls here.\n \nI also point out that DNA cannot be preserved through the fossil record, so we really have no way other than bone structure of identifying/classifying humanoid/ape remains. \n\n A small amount of Neanderthal material has been recovered and analysis shows that they were a different species to Homo sapiens sapiens, with little or no interbreeding. Strange, only material from the youngest fossils can be recovered, not from the much older fossils. How do creationists explain that pattern?\n \nFinally, all dating relies on a constant state of decay (as well as an initial amount of radioactivity in the air). \n\n There is no evidence of any change in rate of radioactive decay rates (except in some extreme conditions for a couple of isotopes which are not used for radiometric dating). The assumption of nil initial daughter isotope in K-Ar and Ar-Ar dating has been tested on numerous occassions and found to be a reliable assumption. The isochron dating method does not rely on the initial concentrations of parent and daughter isotopes.\n \nI further add to this that the amount of radioactivity in the air today has changed so much since the amount found in 1950 that all dating methods are based on the radioactivity in the air in 1950. Yet, scientists still assume that there was a constant rate from the first fossil until 1950. \n\n You don't know much about this, do you? You appear to be referring to radiocarbon dating because the amount of atomspheric C14 increased mid-20th century from atomic bombs. However the method is calibrated with older material of known age. Other radiometric dating techniques are not affected by atmospheric radioisotopes.\n \n \nThat aside, you ask what do creationists have to say about bones that are discovered that display both human and ape features to them (specifically skulls). Remember that for the longest time, evolutionists felt that people from Africa were more closely related to apes because of their facial structure.\n\n Strange, I thought it was christians who thought they were closer to apes and this justified enslaving them.\n \nHumans like to classify, and we like to find things that are similar to us. :-0 looks like a persons face with his mouth open when it is really a colon, a hyphen, and a zero. This is the reason I believe scientists find skulls that are fossilized with both ape and human features. \n\n What nonsense. Could you tell the difference between a human and an ape skull? Why are there skulls with a mixture of characteristic features? Do you want me to find the article which shows how creationists who insist that all fossil skulls are either human or ape can't agree amongst themselves which ones are human and which are apes?\n \nCreationists have also said that since people lived longer, they developed different features. I am not familiar with the research on this, but I believe that it is possible (at least to be researched).\n\n Well, I wouldn't believe it just because a creationist says it.

You appear to be referring to radiocarbon dating because the amount of atmospheric [sic] C14 increased mid-20th century from atomic bombs. Other radiometric dating techniques are not affected by atmospheric radioisotopes.\n 7.Strange, I thought it was Christians who thought they were closer to apes and this justified enslaving them.\n 8. Could you tell the difference between a human and an ape skull? Why are there skulls with a mixture of characteristic features? \n 9. Do you want me to find the article which shows how creationists who insist that all fossil skulls are either human or ape can't agree amongst themselves which ones are human and which are apes?\n 10.Where is the supporting evidence?

If it is from the mouths of evolutionary scientists then you can provide citations, can't you?\n [QUOTE]\n 1. Actually, the only free time I have is between the hours of midnight and 7:30a.m. I usually like to use that to get sleep and get other work done, but unfortunately, I was drawn into this debate to help fellow Christians. Believe me, I only joined the forums to get something published quickly (on a different topic). I (unlike the rest of you) do not have time to post 300 messages here in a week in a half. \n 2. No, I mean there has never been any entirely complete fossilized specimens found (let me specify in the man/ape line lest you tell me there have been millions of complete worms found.). Something is always missing and most of the bones for one specimen are not laid out in a nice little row. Archaeologists often make molds of the missing bones of fossils to complete the skeleton. You can use the recent book by the archeologist who discovered Sue. He goes into detail on the process of finding, labeling, etc. fossils.\n 3. Has it? Are you saying they have found DNA fossilized? What book are you looking at? &#8220;The Field Guide to Prehistoric Life&#8221; tells us that DNA does not fossilize. Perhaps you should write the authors and tell them they are wrong. \n 4. What exactly is this \"material\" you are talking about?\n 5.There is no evidence of any change in rate of radioactive decay rates. Did I anywhere in my e-mail say there was (although Encarta alludes that their may be under certain circumstances, at least I read it that way the same way you read what I said in that way)?\n 6.I cannot find the reference I read that stated this, but if I come across it again, I will not lose it. (Perhaps it was the book on Sue again &#8211; you really should read it, it contains very interesting information not only on fossils, but also on the legal process.) As to C-14, A-bombs went off before 1950. I would think they would have set the freeze before that date if that was what was effecting the change. However, if you read Encarta (again) it seems to allude that all the tens of different ways of dating never seem to collaborate with each other. I also know that U dating is based on the amounts in seawater &#8211; you do not think all the nuclear subs that have crashed recently have changed this?\n 7.Actually, most Christians tried to free slaves &#8211; read &#8220;Out of this Nettle&#8221; (if it is still in print). After you have finished with that, you can read H.G. Well&#8217;s &#8220;An Outline of World History&#8221;. I will provide you with a quote in case the 1000+ pages are too much for you to read since no one has condensed them into a 2 &#8211; 3 page website &#8211; &#8220;Possibly the more ancient of races were all dusky or black, and fairness is new.&#8221; Well&#8217;s was a stanch evolutionist.\n 8. If we are talking about fossils, absolutely not! Especially not from website pictures! It takes scientists many years of study to determine the differences between fossils and classify them (Once again, see Sue). That is why some fossils go for years being labeled as one thing and then are changed after further examination by others. Anyone who claims to be able to tell the difference between two fossils just by a glance or a picture is lying. \n 9. Why? I highly doubt they have taken the time or effort to specialize in this field of fossilization and since regular scientists often have trouble determining the difference between two different species of humanoid, why should I be surprised that people who only have seen pictures cannot figure it out?\n 10.I did not say I agreed with either of the two Christian theories. You asked what other Christians said, and I told you what they have said. The scientist who said our skulls change as we age said so based on skull measurements from a current lifespan and multiplying them, I believe. I do not read creationists works, I only get the information from my husband who does. (How else would scientists be able to determine how old certain animals/humanoids supposedly were when they died if they didn&#8217;t know there were differences in skeletal structure &#8211; see the National Geographic articles on the Iceman they found. They even know how he died and what serious wounds he had recovered from).\n 11. I believe I have provided some citations for you, and all of them are from those who believe in an evolutionary view.\n Now, three final things, if we did not tend to make non-human things human, we would not need the word &#8220;personification&#8221; would we? \n The reason you will find no scientific material debating your fairy theory because fairies are supernatural and no one can form a scientific theory about supernatural things. This is why scientists cannot disprove God exists because He is also in the realm of supernatural. However, scientists can observe changes in n people as they age. They also can theoretically make people live very much longer than what we currently do and are working on it as we speak. So in the future, we could possibly test the age theory more accurately (although the way our life would be prolonged would be quite artificial in my view and not really an accurate judge of it). I also see nothing unscientific about selective breeding. Science already has observed selective breeding in animals, why not in prehistoric humans? \n I realize that I believe in creation, so you are naturally suspicious of everything I write but try not to make assumptions (especially by inserting &#8220;Evolution is wrong because&#8230;&#8221; before every one of my statements when I have never put it there). Also, try to stick to the subject. When I say &#8220;No complete fossil of humanoids has been found&#8221; your statement that &#8220;well this one has been found almost complete&#8221; does nothing to disprove it. The statement still stands. Almost complete is not complete. You could say, &#8220;that doesn&#8217;t make them any less authentic.&#8221; And that would be a good argument, except that I never said anything about it making them any less authentic. I only stated the obvious and let you figure out for yourselves if a missing hand here or there makes a difference. I do find it more interesting though that the hands were missing from an apelike fossil, since the African practice of using the hands of apes in medicine and voodoo had to of originated somewhere. Well, I had better not speculate or you will tell me my theory is impossible even though an evolutionist (with a PhD) might look at my theory in a different light. The main reason I do not reply is not only because I do not have time, but I especially do not have time explaining science to those of you who claim to be Evolutionists but know nothing of science except what your high school and the internet has taught you. I do not like websites simply because I believe in the publication process &#8211; anyone can set up a website, not anyone can be published in a scientific journal.",

   "Do you really want to be friends with these people Montalban? \n I find it funny that the only reason I joined the debate was because I felt that you were trying to see what both sides felt about the story, and you so far had only had bashing responses from those on an evolutionary side mainly asking you to defend a position that you (in my mind) had clearly stated you knew little about. So I figured I could at least give a Christian point of view. Sadly, I have had to explain science all over again in this thread and back it up with citations. Unfortunately evolution is a two edged sword. The creationist cannot read creationist material and use it to defend his position. In order to read the evoutionist material though, it forces you to subject yourself to a different religion in almost the same way that reading the Nag Hammadi or the Vedas does. And the worst thing is that the only people you ever have a chance of saving are those who are Christians but became swayed by evolutionary thought.

   "I am only going to make one reply in this forum and then I am dropping it.\n \n First, I want to point out that no complete humanoid/ape fossils have ever been found. This is also the case here where we only have a skull.\n I also point out that DNA cannot be preserved through the fossil record, so we really have no way other than bone structure of identifying/classifying humanoid/ape remains. \n Finally, all dating relies on a constant state of decay (as well as an initial amount of radioactivity in the air). I further add to this that the amount of radioactivity in the air today has changed so much since the amount found in 1950 that all dating methods are based on the radioactivity in the air in 1950. Yet, scientists still assume that there was a constant rate from the first fossil until 1950. \n \n That aside, you ask what do creationists have to say about bones that are discovered that display both human and ape features to them (specifically skulls). Remember that for the longest time, evolutionists felt that people from Africa were more closely related to apes because of their facial structure. Humans like to classify, and we like to find things that are similar to us. :-0 looks like a persons face with his mouth open when it is really a colon, a hyphen, and a zero. This is the reason I believe scientists find skulls that are fossilized with both ape and human features. \n Creationists have also said that since people lived longer, they developed different features. I am not familiar with the research on this, but I believe that it is possible (at least to be researched). \n A final theory is based on the verse that states the \"sons of God were breeding with the daughters of men\". We have lost what the true meaning of this verse is although there are many interpretations. It is very possible that the offspring of these unions were deformed to some extent (or maybe at that time they were considered more beautiful). Could they have been purposely doing a form of purifying the race through breeding? (Hitler was not the first with this idea). Alternatively, were they possibly trying to make bigger stronger humans? \n I do not necessarily believe the last two theories. My theory is based on what I have observed and the information I gave before it is from the evolutionary scientists' mouths. If you have research (in book or journal form) that disproves either of the Christian theories, feel free to let me know about it, I will check back from time to time. You will not find scientific information that can debate my theory since it is based on evolutionary science and psychology (which in my opinion is all the same thing).\n\n I find it so funny that when science benefits you, you believe in it. But when it contradicts your beliefs you just write it off as a \"theory\" and not fact. Maybe all of your babbeling about the radioactivity is just a \"theory\" and not fact. Please don't just rely on science when it appears to be in your favor",

   "Part 2 of my response to Priscilla's post no.17\n \n\n 11. I believe I have provided some citations for you, and all of them are from those who believe in an evolutionary view.\n\n Look again. You had not provided one citation on this thread prior to post #17, nor in post #17, but you assert that \"the information I gave before it is from the evolutionary scientists' mouths.\" \n \n \nNow, three final things, if we did not tend to make non-human things human, we would not need the word \"personification\" would we? \n Don't you mean \"anthropomorphism\"? Not a good argument to use. Why do scientists say that, for example, Homo habilis skulls are distiguishable from Homo sapiens skulls? Using your argument, wouldn't scientists call them all the same skulls?\n \n \nThe reason you will find no scientific material debating your fairy theory because fairies are supernatural and no one can form a scientific theory about supernatural things. This is why scientists cannot disprove God exists because He is also in the realm of supernatural. \n\n And this is why there will be no scientific journal articles on the breeding habits and genetics of sons of god either. \n \n \nHowever, scientists can observe changes in people as they age. \n\n Been reading Cuozzo, have you? Unfortunately for creatioists, using scientific data to try and show that Neanderthals are very old Homo sapiens doesn't work. As Colin Groves describes:\n \n Actually, how many hundreds of years old were La Chapelle and La Ferrassie? You get different answers from different measurements. From near-maturity (Le Moustier's age) into old age, modern human cranial length increases at 0.06mm per year, according to the figures Cuozzo quotes and which I see no reason to doubt; La Ferrassie's cranial length is 16mm greater than Le Moustier's, so this represents 267 years of growth. Total facial height, on the contrary, grows at 0.18mm/yr, giving only 137 years' growth between Le Moustier and La Ferrassie; while lower facial height grows at 0.063mm/yr, giving 278 years' growth; basal skull length grows at 0.052mm/year, giving 365 years' growth; and so on. There is, in other words, variability. Moreover, calculating the growth from Le Moustier to La Chapelle, you find using some measurements that La Chapelle is older than La Ferrassie, but using others that it is younger.\n \n from http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/cuozzo_cg.html\n \n \nThey also can theoretically make people live very much longer than what we currently do and are working on it as we speak. So in the future, we could possibly test the age theory more accurately (although the way our life would be prolonged would be quite artificial in my view and not really an accurate judge of it).\n\n Don't hold you breath for this to help the creationist argument.\n \n \n I also see nothing unscientific about selective breeding. Science already has observed selective breeding in animals, why not in prehistoric humans? \n Any evidence for it occurring in any human societies?\n \nI realize that I believe in creation, so you are naturally suspicious of everything I write but try not to make assumptions (especially by inserting \"Evolution is wrong because...\" before every one of my statements when I have never put it there). \n You're talking nonsense.\n \nAlso, try to stick to the subject. When I say \"No complete fossil of humanoids has been found\" your statement that \"well this one has been found almost complete\" does nothing to disprove it. The statement still stands. Almost complete is not complete. You could say, \"that doesn't make them any less authentic.\" And that would be a good argument, except that I never said anything about it making them any less authentic. I only stated the obvious and let you figure out for yourselves if a missing hand here or there makes a difference. \n\n This is nonsense. Detail the features which are diagnostic for distinguishing between humans and apes. \n \nI do find it more interesting though that the hands were missing from an apelike fossil, since the African practice of using the hands of apes in medicine and voodoo had to of originated somewhere. \n\n So, is Turkana Boy an ape now based on this anecdotal evidence?\n \nWell, I had better not speculate or you will tell me my theory is impossible even though an evolutionist (with a PhD) might look at my theory in a different light. \n\n Well why don't you find a citation from a PhD paleontologist which supports your assertion?\n \nThe main reason I do not reply is not only because I do not have time, but I especially do not have time explaining science to those of you who claim to be Evolutionists but know nothing of science except what your high school and the internet has taught you.\n\n I hope you are not referring to me because, if so, you are sadly mistaken.\n \n I do not like websites simply because I believe in the publication process - anyone can set up a website, not anyone can be published in a scientific journal.\n\n Hopefully any websites I provide will have references to original publications in scientific journals.

   "I don't know. What part of the bit where I said I'm trying to find these out escapes you? As I said, you're reading too much into this... When I've been firm in something -e.g. Darwin's Finch, Lurch being a loser, I've said so.\n\n \n I noticed on the &#8216;Answers in genesis&#8217; board in the &#8216;Arguments we think creationists should NOT use&#8217; section they have the following:\n \n \nNo new species have been produced.&#8217; This is not true&#8212;new species have been observed to form. In fact, rapid speciation is an important part of the creation model. But this speciation is within the &#8216;kind&#8217;, and involves no new genetic information.\n\n \n And inside that section is the following quote:\n \n \nThirteen species of finches live on the Gal\u00e1pagos, the famous island group visited by Charles Darwin in the 1830s. The finches have a variety of bill shapes and sizes, all suited to their varying diets and lifestyles. The explanation given by Darwin was that they are all the offspring of an original pair of finches, and that natural selection is responsible for the differences.\n \n Surprisingly to some, this is the explanation now held by most modern creationists. It would not need to be an &#8216;evolutionary&#8217; change at all, in the sense of giving any evidence for amoeba-to-man transformation. No new genetic information would have been introduced. If the parent population has sufficient created variability (genetic potential) to account for these varied features in its descendants, natural selection could take care of the resulting adaptation, as a simplistic example will show.\n\n \n Seems like you are behind the times monty. Even the creationists are now saying there is speciation because of the necessity in not overflowing the ark. And of all things, they are using Darwin&#8217;s finches to prove it. HAHAHAHAHAHA",

So it's take you all this time to catch up?\n \n You yourself recognise that some Christians take literal views of Genesis, and some don't. I take what information I like as do you.\n \n At least I don't change my position entirely as you do here...\n \n Recently you have been defending the concept of \"Survival of the Fittest\", against my 'lucky turtle' theory but Hank, on post 227 of \"Grudgingly conceding some points\"\n You quoted \n \nFrom talk orgins\n \n \"Survival of the fittest\" is a poor way to think about evolution. Darwin himself never used the phrase. What Darwin said is that heritable variations lead to differential reproductive success. It is a prediction which can be, and has been, experimentally verified.\n\n \n You actually claimed Evolutionaries don't even use the phrase, then! Now you've changed tact.\n \n See 332 of said for a rebuttal.",
