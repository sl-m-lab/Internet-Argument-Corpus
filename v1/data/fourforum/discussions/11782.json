   "I want to know! Only think of it! Highly sensitive documents on Iraq war has been stolen (!) after being left unguarded (!) on a train from London to the Leeds. As reported in our press a certain lawyer, who \"worked for British Government, could not fit his suitcase with secret (!) papers into the overhead storage space and had instead stowed it in a baggage rack at the end of the carriage\"! Who are ready to eat such ####?\n Moreover, this incident is simply the latest in a long of embarrassing losses of government information (timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article5755728). As sure as a gun that this enterprising lawyer has seized the occasion of full incompetence of our governmental authorities, dared to send secret documents in ordinary trains, and has sold the confidential information of our military at a high rate to al-Qaida's agents, who have invaded this country now! It is likely that there are a lot of similar traitors among our corrupted functionaries. It proves that we should wage war not in Iraq or Afghanistan, but, first of all, here, in Britain! \n We are sick and tired of these incidents and governmental excuses of them which are full of ####! It is clear as a day that we are simply in urgent need of quick changing present government!",
