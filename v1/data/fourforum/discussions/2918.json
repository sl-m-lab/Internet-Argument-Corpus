   "Don't know if this will help anyone or not. It ain't much, but here is some research into who on the current SCOTUS court has said what, if anything, about the RKBA. None of what I can find exists as an actual decision in a case, but merely mentions the RKBA in passing, often with a reference to another individual right. \n \n Here is the current list of SCOTUS justices, indexed to the cases where they either made mention of or concurred in an opinion that made mention of the RKBA.\n \n BREYER, J.-I can't find anything for him yet.\n STEVENS, -- Wrote the dissent from which I quote in Albright v. Oliver, but see also concurrence with quote from majority opinion written by former justice BLACKMUN in Lewis v. U.S.\n O'CONNOR, -- Wrote opinion quoted from in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, concurred with REHNQUIST'S opinion quoted from United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez\n KENNEDY, - concurred with O'CONNOR'S opinion quoted in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, concurred Rhenquist's opinion quoted in United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez\n THOMAS, JJ.,--Wrote concurring opinion quoted from in Printz v. United States\n GINSBURG, J., --Wrote dissenting opinion quoted from in Muscarello v. United States REHNQUIST, C. J.,-- Wrote opinion quoted from in United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, concurred with GINSBURG'S dissent quoted in Muscarello v. United States, but see his concurrence (along with STEVENS) with former justice BLACKMUN'S opinion quoted from Lewis v. U.S.\n SCALIA -Concurred with GINSBURG'S dissent opinion in Muscarello v. United States, concurred with RHENQUIST'S opinion in United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez\n SOUTER, JJ-Concurred with GINSBURG'S dissent opinion quoted from Muscarello v. United States, concurred with O'CONNOR'S opinion in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey\n \n A word on these opinions. SCOTUS judges are nit-pickers-They will often concur and dissent with different portions of a particular Justice's opinion where they think it accords or disagrees with their philosophy. Each quoted portion I reproduce here is the actual relevant quote lifted from a particular opinion written by a SCOTUS justice. Where I list other justices concurring with the quoted opinion, it means that the particular justice adopted the language as his own instead of writing something different on the matter. It can mean one of two things: Either the justice completely agrees with what his/her fellow justice says, OR, he/she feels that the issue quoted is trivial enough that it does not warrant some further distinction by a different opinion. Now for the quoted cases, which I will present in chronological order:\n \n 1. Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, 56 (1980)  \n \n [This one needs a little more intro, because it dealt with an appeal of an individual convicted of possessing a firearm while a convicted felon. This is the strongest wording I can find from a current SCOTUS justice \"limiting\" the reach of the 2nd. Amendment--in footnote 8]\n \n ISSUE: A GUN CASE OF SORTS, BUT REALLY A 6TH. AMENDMENT RIGHT TO COUNSEL CASE. Appeal by a man convicted of possessing a firearm while being a convicted felon. The appeal claimed that the Court should not count a prior felony conviction as barring possession of a firearm under the criminal statute where the defendant was not represented by counsel when he was convicted of that prior felony. \n NARROW HOLDING: Defendants have other means to remove the prior felony disability to possession of a firearm [like petitioning for restoration of civil rights], and a new prosecution for firearm possession cannot be used as a vehicle to attack the prior felony conviction.\n \n Majority opinion by retired justice BLACKMUN, concurred with by current justices STEVENS and RHENQUIST:\n \n \"The firearm regulatory scheme at issue here is consonant with the concept of equal protection embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment if there is \"some `rational basis' for the statutory distinctions made . . . or . . . they `have some relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made.'\" Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 422 (1974), quoting from McGinnis v. Royster, 410 U.S. 263, 270 (1973), and Baxstrom v. Herold, 383 U.S. 107, 111 (1966). See Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97 (1979). [footnote 8] Section 1202 (a) (1) clearly meets that test. Congress, as its expressed purpose in enacting Title VII reveals, 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1201, was concerned that the receipt and possession of a firearm by a felon constitutes a threat, among other things, to the continued and effective operation of the Government of the United States. The legislative history of the gun control laws discloses Congress' worry about the easy availability of firearms, especially to those persons who pose a threat to community peace. And Congress focused on the nexus between violent crime and the possession of a firearm by any person with a criminal record. 114 Cong. Rec. 13220 (1968) (remarks of Sen. Tydings); id., at 16298 (remarks of Rep. Pollock). Congress could rationally conclude that any felony conviction, even an allegedly invalid one, is a sufficient basis on which to prohibit the possession of a firearm. See, e. g., United States v. Ransom, 515 F.2d 885, 891-892 (CA5 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 944 (1976). This Court has recognized repeatedly that a legislature constitutionally may prohibit a convicted felon from engaging in activities far more fundamental than the possession of a firearm. See Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U.S. 24 (1974) (disenfranchisement); De Veau v. Braisted, 363 U.S. 144 (1960) (proscription against holding office in a waterfront labor organization); Hawker v. New York, 170 U.S. 189 (1898) (prohibition against the practice of medicine).\n We recognize, of course, that under the Sixth Amendment an uncounseled felony conviction cannot be used for certain purposes. See Burgett, Tucker, and Loper, all supra. The Court, however, has never suggested that an uncounseled conviction [Page 67] is invalid for all purposes. See Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367 (1979); Loper v. Beto, 405 U.S., at 482. n. 11 (plurality opinion). Again, it is important to note that a convicted felon may challenge the validity of a prior conviction. or otherwise remove his disability, before obtaining a firearm. We simply hold today that the firearms prosecution does not open the predicate conviction to a new form of collateral attack. See Note, Prior Convictions and the Gun Control Act of 1968. [Page 68] 76 Colum. L. Rev. 326, 338-339 (1976). Cf. Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. 307 (1967).\n \n [footnote 8] These legislative restrictions on the use of firearms are neither based upon constitutionally suspect criteria, nor do they trench upon any constitutionally protected liberties. See United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 178 (1939) (the Second Amendment guarantees no right to keep and bear a firearm that does not have \"some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia\"); United States v. Three Winchester 30-30 Caliber Lever Action Carbines, 504 F.2d 1288, 1290, n. 5 (CA7 1974); United States v. Johnson, 497 F.2d 548 (CA4 1974); Cody v. United States, 460 F.2d 34 (CA8), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1010 (1972) (the latter three cases holding, respectively, that \u00a7 1202 (a) (1), \u00a7 922 (g), and \u00a7 922 (a) (6) do not violate the Second Amendment).\" \n \n Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, 68 (1980)\n \n 2. United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 264-266 (1990)\n \n ISSUE: NOT A GUN CASE, A 4TH AMENDMENT CASE. The Defendant was a Mexican national who was arrested in Mexico and sent to the U.S. for drug prosecution. After arrest, the DEA and Mexican police searched his Mexican home without a warrant. Defendant sought to use 4th. Amendment to exclude evidence found in his Mexican house. \n NARROW HOLDING: Essentially, the defendant as a foreign national whose foreign house was searched does not meet the class of individual protected by the term \"the people\" in the Bill of Rights.\n Majority opinion of RHENQUIST, joined by O'CONNOR, SCALIA, and KENNEDY:\n \n \"That text [4th. amendment], by contrast with the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, extends its reach only to \"the people.\" Contrary to the suggestion of amici curiae that the Framers used this phrase \"simply to avoid [an] awkward rhetorical redundancy,\" Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 12, n. 4, \"the people\" seems to have been a term of art employed in select parts of the Constitution. The Preamble declares that the Constitution is ordained and established by \"the people of the United States.\" The Second Amendment protects \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\" and the Ninth and Tenth Amendments provide that certain rights and powers are retained by and reserved to \"the people.\" See also U.S. Const., Amdt. 1 (\"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging . . . the right of the people peaceably to assemble\") (emphasis added); Art. I, \u00a7 2, cl. 1 (\"The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the people of the several States \") (emphasis added). While this textual exegesis is by no means conclusive, it suggests that \"the people\" protected by the Fourth Amendment, and by the First and Second Amendments, and to whom rights and powers are reserved in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community.\"\n \n United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 264-266 (1990)\n \n 3. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 843-844 (1992)\n \n ISSUE: NOT A GUN CASE, BUT AN ABORTION CASE. The holding is immaterial here, O'CONNER is supporting her view of the \"penumbra\" doctrine, that other individual rights [like abortion in this case] exist in addition to those specifically mentioned in the Bill of Rights and that they are also protected by the 5th. and 14th. Amendment \"due \"process\" clauses. O'CONNER here uses some oft-cited language from former Justice Harlan's dissent in Poe v. Ullman.\n \n Majority opinion of JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by JUSTICE KENNEDY, and JUSTICE SOUTER:\n \n \"[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This \"liberty\" is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.\" Poe v. [Page 849] Ullman, supra, at 543 (opinion dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds).\"\n \n Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 843-844 (1992)\n \n 4. Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 291 (1994)\n \n ISSUE: NOT A GUN CASE. A \"PENUMBRA\" RIGHTS CASE LIKE #3 ABOVE. Stevens is also a fan of the \"penumbra\" doctrine, and here he also cites back to the dissent language from POE v. ULLMAN\n \n Dissent by JUSTICE STEVENS:\n \n \"[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This \"liberty\" is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.\" Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 543 (1961) (dissenting opinion).\"\n \n Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 306-307 (1994)\n \n 5. Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 937-939 (1997)\n \n ISSUE: A GUN CASE, BUT A 10TH AMENDMENT, NOT A 2ND. AMENDMENT CASE. WHETHER PORTIONS OF THE \"BRADY ACT\" MANDATING THAT LOCAL CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS MST CONDUCT BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR FIREARMS PURCHASES VIOLATED THE 10TH. AMENDMENT.\n HOLDING: IN THIS CASE, COMPELLING STATE OFFICIALS TO ENFORCE FEDERAL MANDATES VIOLATES THE 10TH. AMENDMENT.\n \n Concurring opinion of Justice THOMAS [This is the strongest support I can find for a robust individual RKBA among the current SCOTUS justices]:\n \n \"Even if we construe Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce to encompass those intrastate transactions that \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce, I question whether Congress can regulate the particular transactions at issue here. The Constitution, in addition to delegating certain enumerated powers to Congress, places whole areas outside the reach of Congress' regulatory authority. The First Amendment, for example, is fittingly celebrated for preventing Congress from \"prohibiting the free exercise\" of religion or \"abridging the freedom of speech.\" The Second Amendment similarly appears to contain an express limitation on the Government's authority. That Amendment provides: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" This Court has not had recent occasion to consider the nature of the substantive right safeguarded by the Second Amendment.[Footnote 1] If, however, the Second Amendment is read to confer a personal right to \"keep and bear arms,\" a colorable argument exists that the Federal Government's regulatory scheme, at least as it pertains to the purely intrastate sale or possession of firearms, runs afoul of that Amendment's protections.[Footnote 2] As the parties did not raise this argument, however, we need not consider it here. Perhaps, at some future date, this Court will have the opportunity to determine whether Justice Story was correct when he wrote that the right to bear arms \"has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic.\" 3 J. Story, Commentaries \u00a7 1890, p. 746 (1833). In the meantime, I join the Court's opinion striking down the challenged provisions of the Brady Act as inconsistent with the Tenth Amendment.\n \n [Footnote 1] Our most recent treatment of the Second Amendment occurred in United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), in which we reversed the District Court's invalidation of the National Firearms Act, enacted in 1934. In Miller, we determined that the Second Amendment did not guarantee a citizen's right to possess a sawed-off shotgun because that weapon had not been shown to be \"ordinary military equipment\" that could \"contribute to the common defense.\" Id., at 178. The Court did not, however, attempt to define, or otherwise construe, the substantive right protected by the Second Amendment.\n \n [Footnote 2] Marshaling an impressive array of historical evidence, a growing body of scholarly commentary indicates that the \"right to keep and bear arms\" is, as the Amendment's text suggests, a personal right. See, e.g., J. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an Anglo-American Right 162 (1994); S. Halbrook, That Every Man Be Armed, The Evolution of a Constitutional Right (1984); Van Alstyne, The Second Amendment and the Personal Right to Arms, 43 Duke L. J. 1236 (1994); Amar, The Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment, 101 Yale L. J. 1193 (1992); Cottrol & Diamond, The Second Amendment: Toward an Afro-Americanist Reconsideration, 80 Geo. L. J. 309 (1991); Levinson, The Embarrassing Second Amendment, 99 Yale L. J. 637 (1989); Kates, Handgun Prohibition and the Original Meaning of the Second Amendment, 82 Mich. L. Rev. 204 (1983). Other scholars, however, argue that the Second Amendment does not secure a personal right to keep or to bear arms. See, e.g., Bogus, Race, Riots, and Guns, 66 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1365 (1993); Williams, Civic Republicanism and the Citizen Militia: The Terrifying Second Amendment, 101 Yale L. J. 551 (1991); Brown, Guns, Cowboys, Philadelphia Mayors, and Civic Republicanism: On Sanford Levinson's The Embarrassing Second Amendment, 99 Yale L. J. 661 (1989); Cress, An Armed Community: The Origins and Meaning of the Right to Bear Arms, 71 J. Am. Hist. 22 (1984). Although somewhat overlooked in our jurisprudence, the Amendment has certainly engendered considerable academic, as well as public, debate.\"\n \n Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 937-939 (1997)\n \n 6. Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125 (1998)  \n \n ISSUE: A \"GUN\" CASE/CRIME ENFORCEMENT CASE. INTERPRETATION OF THE PHRASE \"CARRIES A FIREARM\" IN A FED. STATUTE THAT MADE IT AN ADDITIONAL FELONY OFFENSE TO DO SO \"DURING AND IN RELATION TO\" A \"DRUG TRAFFICKING CRIME.\" WHETHER HAVING THE GUN IN THE GLOVEBOX OF A TRUCK USED TO TRANSPORT MARIJUANA FITS THE DEFINITION OF \"CARRIES\" IN THE STATUTE.\n HOLDING: \"CARRIES A FIREARM\" IS BROAD ENOUGH TO COVER HAVING IT IN THE GLOVEBOX.\n \n Dissent by GINSBURG, joined by REHNQUIST, SCALIA and SOUTER [question: does this case suggest (an opinion I support) that the individual RKBA also be viewed in context with the right of self defense?] [NOTE: THE FOOTNOTES WERE OMITTED AS IRRELEVEANT]:\n \n \"Unlike the Court, I do not think dictionaries, surveys of press reports, or the Bible tell us, dispositively, what \"carries\" means embedded in \u00a7 924(c)(1). On definitions, \"carry\" in legal formulations could mean, inter alia, transport, possess, have in stock, prolong (carry over), be infectious, or wear or bear on one's person.5 At issue here is not \"carries\" at large but \"carries a firearm.\" The Court's computer search of newspapers is revealing in this light. Carrying guns in a car showed up as the meaning \"perhaps more than one-third\" of the time. Ante, at 129. One is left to wonder what meaning showed up some two-thirds of the time. Surely a most familiar meaning is, as the Constitution's Second Amendment (\"keep and bear Arms\") (emphasis added) and Black's Law Dictionary, at 214, indicate: \"wear, bear, or carry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.\" [NOTE: THE EMPHASIS ADDED AND THE ... EDITS ARE GINSBURG'S, NOT MINE]\n \n Let me ask this question: Can anyone here look at this and suggest which way a particular justice may go when the individual/collective RKBA question is finally forced upon them?",
