It would seem to me that there is a larger population of non-Christians, as well as those who fall into the atheist/agnostic camp, than these polls generally present.

But it also makes me wonder how they conducted the poll. In all my life I can count on one hand where I have been a part of a poll, with that being said Is there some kind of bias going on?\n Did they go to church to poll these people, did they use the Christian phonebook? How can we find out this type of stuff? Is there anyway to accurately poll the States and also have a non biased outcome? How can we truly know what everyone thinks?",

   "I don't think we can actually know, Anastasia. If you call a churchgoer, one who truly wants to believe, but has no reason or has never felt His presence, they might say that they believe the Bible due to their present position. That&#8217;s just one example that I know could be the case. I have spent some time with folks that &#8220;are learning&#8221; about God and place themselves in the believer bracket &#8211; even though they can&#8217;t tell you why.\n \n And, if a person believes enough, that person should be classified as a believer, regardless of his or her grounds. Who knows what&#8217;s in the heart, but God?\n \n Like I said, in my area, the percentage would be much greater. Knowing that and knowing that communities tend to develop in time over some pattern of belief, the percentage could be lower just a few miles down the interstate.\n \n It would be interesting to see a poll taken by another source, though. Still, I think the poll in your link would be the average &#8211; or close, anyway.",

And like you said there are some areas that may have different results, I just wonder how they choose their control groups.\n At this present time for me, I would have to fall under the non believers because I honestly don't know how I feel. But I do have a really hard time with immaculate conception...\n Also if someone else were taking the poll like an atheist organization, I wonder how different the results would be, where would they start. I would imagine whomever is doing the poll is going to have some preconceived notion on where to start and that must have an influence...",

Let's say that the pollster asked, \"Do you believe in that junk about a ghost impregnating this virgin, huh?\" I think the results would vary.\n \n But, if the pollster was clever, and knew how to guide or manipulate the answers (like political pollsters) then the outcome would be different. It's not necessarly the questions, it's how they ask them and how confusing they can make them. I'm sure a seasoned researcher can tell the character of a person in just a few words over the phone.",
