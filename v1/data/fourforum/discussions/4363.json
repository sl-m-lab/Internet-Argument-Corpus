   "Anti-Gay Group Sets Sights On Shrek\n by John McKay, CP\n \n Posted: February 21, 2005 5:01 pm. ET \n Shrek 2 is the latest animated film title to be ``outed'' by Christian fundamentalists.\n \n Though they seem to have ignored Sunday's gay kiss on Desperate Housewives, and the coming out of Patty on The Simpsons, fundamentalists are expressing outrage over Shrek 2 \n \n On its website the Traditional Values Coalition is warning parents about the cross-dressing and transgender themes contained in the hit DreamWorks feature, now on DVD.\n \n ``Shrek 2 is billed as harmless entertainment but contains subtle sexual messages,'' says the coalition, which describes itself as a grassroots inter-denominational lobby with more than 43,000 member churches.\n \n ``Parents who are thinking about taking their children to see Shrek 2 may wish to consider the following.''\n \n The article then proceeds to describe one of the characters, an ``evil'' bartender (voiced by Larry King) who is a male-to-female transgender in transition and who expresses a sexual desire for Prince Charming.\n \n In another identified scene, Shrek and Donkey need rescuing from a dungeon by Pinocchio and his nose, which is made to extend as an escape bridge by getting the wooden boy to lie about not wearing women's underwear.\n \n The TVC report, A Gender Identity Disorder Goes Mainstream', raps DreamWorks for helping to promote \"crossdressing and transgenderism.\"\n \n But Charles Keil, a film studies professor at the University of Toronto, says transgendered groups might also have reason to complain about being parodied.\n \n ``You have an image within a comic context that could be read either way,'' says Keil, who adds quickly that such humor is designed for parents anyway and goes way above the heads of the children in the audience.\n \n ``If the kids don't get it, it doesn't really matter.''\n \n Keil says the whole idea behind the Shrek movies is a general message of tolerance - that outward appearances don't matter and that it's what's underneath that counts - and such complaints defeat that larger, more important message.\n \n ``Targeting minuscule elements within a much larger work and then trying to extract from that some kind of argument that borders on the paranoid is really misconstruing the general aim of this entertainment.''\n \n So far, the Coalition's gaydar doesn't seem to have picked up on DreamWorks' Shark Tale, in which a shark mafioso, voiced by Robert DeNiro, must come to terms with the fact he has a vegetarian son who likes to dress up as a dolphin.\n \n But the Shrek accusation follows hot on the heels of other cases of animated characters being accused of infiltrating the minds of America's children with pro-gay messages, much to the detriment of traditional family values.\n \n Recently, PBS was upbraided by the group Focus on the Family _ and supported by the U.S. secretary of education no less _ for an episode of the cartoon series Postcards From Buster, in which Buster the rabbit encounters a couple of kids with lesbian parents.\n \n Christian activists have also targeted SpongeBob SquarePants, Barney the dinosaur and Sesame Street's Bert & Ernie as children's characters who are conduits for a soft-on-gays message.\n \n Just last month, the American Family Association took exception to the makers of a new video being distributed to thousands of U.S. elementary schools and which the organization said used characters like SpongeBob and Barney to indoctrinate children into a homosexual lifestyle.\n \n The video is designed to coincide with National We Are Family Day in March. But what upset the AFA in particular is the We Are Family Foundation's website and a tolerance-for-diversity pledge (including sexual orientation) that children and others are asked to sign there.\n \n It seems all of this began back in 1999 when Rev. Jerry Falwell described that purse-toting Teletubby, Tinky Winky, as a gay role model.\n \n One wonders how far back critics could go, though, in seeing pro-homosexual context in cartoons. Remember when shotgun-toting hunter Elmer Fudd realized Bugs Bunny was in drag? He was furious, but only because he saw Bugs's cotton tail and learned he was a rabbit in disguise.\n \n ``There's all sorts of things going on in those cartoons that are pretty suggestive,'' concedes Keil. ``But (the kids) are laughing at the pratfalls, the funny voices, the very basic humor.\n \n ``Kids at that age don't even have pre-formed notions of sexuality.''\n \n In the recent SpongeBob movie, there is a scene in which the oddball undersea character suddenly pops up in his neighbor's shower (and quickly gets the boot). It's also been pointed out that he holds hands with a pink friend and gets boating lessons from a teacher called Mr. Puff. Creator Stephen Hillenburg assured the Wall Street Journal that the sponge-man was not gay but that the show had become a gay community favorite because of the tolerant attitude displayed by the show's characters.\n \n ``Everybody is different and the show embraces that,'' Hillenburg said. ``I always think of them as being somewhat asexual.''\n \n Keil wonders what these religious groups would accomplish if they managed to get a law passed banning any representation of untoward social behavior in children's entertainment.\n \n ``It would still be there covertly,'' he argues. ``What would these groups see as the ideal state of affairs?''\n \n \u00a9CP 2005\n \n \n __________________________________________________________\n I saw Shark Tale and it was a great film. Will Smith is great. I completely saw the gay thing in the young shark and thought it was awesome. I wondered how long it would take to be \"outed\"",

   "One problem about your complaints over the call for tolerance and diversity is that the very theme is EMBRACED by this society, including your so-called conservative elements. \"Tolerance and diversity\" is the virtual mantra of the pro-America, pro-Bush crowd AND the pro-America, anti-Bush crowd. It's an AMERICAN value. And in everyone's eyes, it applies to race, national origin, religion, ability, etc. \n\n \n I don't disagree that tolerance and diversity is a good thing, I'd just love to see the entertainment industry and the educational system either pick something else for awhile or actually (GASP) do something for the sake of entertainment or actual education (regarding the edu. system).\n \n \nFor the left (or at least much of it) it also applies to sexual minorities. For the right, we're the only group left out (well, us and commies).\n\n \n LOL, bless your heart . . . you actually still believe most of the the political left really does view gays as something more than a convenient voting percentage.

   "The Lies of James Dobson and Focus on the Family\n Dr. James Dobson and Gay Bashing ''101-201''\n \n December 02, 2004\n \n By: David Palmer\n Independent Media TV\n \n First and foremost, it should be noted that I am not an advocate for or against Gay people; however, I am an ardent and unapologetic believer that every person is entitled to be treated equally and fairly regardless of their ethnicity, race, religious beliefs, and/or sexual preference. To assert and/or publicly opine that one is a true Christian when one engages in name-calling and exhorting others to openly discriminate against another person or group gives Christian hypocrisy a bad name.\n The recent election results have surely taught us that Gay Bashing has turned into a \"successful\" Olympian sport by so-called Christian moralists like Dr. James Dobson and his cadre of enablers and opportunists.\n \n Well-known Focus on the Family founder Dr. James Dobson has spent a great deal of time, effort and money (none of which was his) in vilifying and viciously attacking the gay community. Dobson's vehicle for spewing forth his homophobic rant is aimed at amending the US Constitution to outlaw gay marriages.\n \n In October, Dobson spoke on behalf of Senatorial Candidate Tom Coburn of Oklahoma at a rally at Oklahoma Christian University in support of a constitutional ban on gay marriages. To prove that gay marriages led to fewer men and women getting married, Dobson cited countries such as Norway that have allowed same-sex couples to marry.\n \n Dobson said 80 percent of children are born out of wedlock in Norway. \"Homosexuals are not monogamous. They want to destroy the institution of marriage. It will destroy marriage. It will destroy the Earth, Dobson said.\" (The Oklahoman, 10-23-03)\n \n Not to be outdone by his mentor and political supporter, Tom Coburn told Rogers County Republicans last year, \"The gay community has infiltrated the very centers of power in every area across this country, and they wield extreme power... That agenda is the greatest threat to our freedom that we face today. Why do you think we see the rationalization for abortion and multiple sexual partners? That's a gay agenda.\"\n \n Lord have mercy, if these statements are true, and who would question the veracity of Christian stalwarts like Dobson and Coburn, then we (that's us so-called straight God-fearing folks) should be truly concerned about the power (Is that extreme power Mr. Coburn? Is there another kind, said Jack Nicholson, I'm sorry, I mean Coburn) of the gay community that will (a) destroy marriages, (b) destroy the earth (whew, and I was worried about global warming), and (c) the greatest threat to our freedom (I guess so, now that Saddam's been captured).\n \n Oklahomans are lucky to have voted for a visionary (soothsayer) like Senator Tom Coburn who was able to perceive that abortion is a \"gay agenda.\" Whew, Dr. Tom must be blessed with ESPN, don't ya think? I don't know about you, but I find it laughable at best to claim that abortion is a gay issue. Ever heard of a gay couple seeking an abortion or lamenting over an unwanted pregnancy? Now, I don't mean to disparage Dr. Tom if ya know what I mean. After all, he's a gynecologist and I'm not; however Dr. Tom should stop buying recreational drugs from street vendors in Tulsa who accept double off coupons.\n \n In 1998, Dr. Dobson gave a speech wherein he stated, \"You don't have to be taught that it's wrong to steal and to lie and to extort and to bribe and to oppress the poor and to express racial hatred and to be promiscuous, both homosexually and heterosexually. There's no difference between those two. Promiscuity it immoral, as is adultery. That law is eternal and it is written on the heart of man.\"\n \n It seems as though Dr. Dobson finds it convenient to tell \"lies\" while bashing the gay community. Dobson's statement that 80 percent of children in Norway are born out of wedlock is false and a total fabrication. According to Statistics Norway (government entity), which can be found at http://www.ssb.no/www-open/english/ the rate in 2003 was 50.5%, which isn't anywhere near 80%. I suppose this Christian lie is acceptable when bashing gays, right Dr. Jim?\n \n Dr. Dobson's fabrication in disabusing Norwegians to promote his gay bashing by claiming that gay marriages will destroy the earth, our moral fiber (values) and lead to destruction of marriage is not only absurd it is patently false. Put simply, Dr. Jim found Norwegians to be an acceptable target by claiming their liberal views on same sex marriage led to runaway abortions, out of wedlock marriages and destruction of marriages (divorces) and that America would face the same damnable fate if it failed to abide by his Christian values in bashing gays.\n \n Well, I'm here to tell ya that Dr. Jim is a damn liar! The real truth according to US and Norwegian government statistics as to abortions, divorces and children born out of wedlock are as follows.\n \n - 2000-Norway had 14,655 abortions-population 4.5 million\n - Alabama had 13,830 abortions-population 4.4 million\n - Tennessee had 19,010 abortions-population 5.7 million\n - North Carolina had 37,610 abortions-population 8.0 million\n \n - 2001-03-Norway had 31,515 divorces-population 4.5 million\n - Arkansas had 50,109 divorces-population 2.7 million\n - Arizona had 71,206 divorces-population 2.7 million\n - Alabama had 68,333 divorces-population 4.4 million\n - Kentucky had 62,998 divorces-population 4.0 million\n - Tennessee had 90,685 divorces-population 5.7 million\n \n - 2001-Norway had 28,515 out-of-wedlock birth-population 4.5 million\n - Arizona had 33,475 out-of-wedlock births-population 2.7 million\n - Louisiana had 30,980 out-of-wedlock births-population 4.5 million\n Source: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/pdf/nvsr52_22_t3.pdf\n \n The factual statistics above prove beyond all doubt that Dr. Jim and his cadre of enablers and False Profits like Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Robert Land and Senator Coburn and their ilk find it both acceptable to spew forth total fabrications in their lust and zeal to paint themselves as moral Christian-Value crusaders that are servants and spokesmen for Christ.\n \n When openly discriminating against African Americans (albeit it in a Christian way) no longer guaranteed political power and financial success, these vile men set out to find a new minority to target, which was and is the gay community. They then manipulated their flocks by spewing forth hateful and discriminatory claims under the guise that they were the guardians of Christianity.\n \n Senator Coburn's statement that the gay community has infiltrated the very centers of power in every area across this country, and that they wield extreme power\" is pure hyperbole (bs). I don't consider the local hair salon to be a \"center of power,\" do you? Of course the real centers of power are located in places like the Whitehouse or statehouse in Sacramento. Other than a few girly-men running amuck in Sacramento, I'm not aware of any gay power brokers operating there or in DC, are you?\n \n The sad truth is that these kinds of zealots and ideologues are willing to do/say anything to obtain power and/or enrich themselves at the expense of those they falsely claim to represent. Setting into motion an agenda (scheme) to dupe their flocks in believing that minority gays deserve to be ostracized, humiliated and discriminated against for the betterment of the country and in the name of Christ is appalling.\n \n Who will these purveyors of hate target for the 2008 election? What group among us will they claim threatens our freedom? Will it be your group? Or will it be my mine? How many more lies and fabrications will they be willing to foist upon us in the name of Jesus?\n \n Finally, we all have an inalienable right to disagree with anyone's lifestyle; however, none of us has a right to impose our so-called values on our fellow brothers and sisters no matter how righteous we believe our cause to be.\n \n \n Original Link: http://www.independent-media.tv/item.cfm?fmedia_id=9988&fcategory_desc=Under%20Reported",

   "http://www.soulforce.org/pdf/dobsonbooklet/deceptionbyomission.pdf\n \n Strange Science\n How research is twisted to promote Dr. Dobson's antigay bias\n Dr. Dobson searches the media for negative stories\n about the gay community that reinforce old stereotypes and\n create fear.\n \n Here is a quote from a Focus article entitled \"Same-Sex Couple Already\n Seeking Divorce\"\n It might be too soon to start saying \"I told you so,\" but\n evidence confirming what many already know-homosexual\n relationships are notoriously unstable and short\n lived-is already filtering in. One homosexual couple\n issued a marriage license by the city of San Francisco and\n Mayor Gavin Newsom just a few months ago is already\n trying to dissolve that decision.87\n Between 40 percent and 60 percent of gay men and between 45 percent and\n 80 percent of lesbians are in committed relationships; between 18 percent and\n 28 percent of gay couples and 8 percent and 21 percent of lesbian couples have lived together ten years or more.88 But Focus on the Family finds one gay\n couple whose relationship didn't make it and wants the reader to accept this as\n evidence that \"homosexual relationships are notoriously unstable and short\n lived.\" No one has ever suggested that if gay Americans gain the right to\n marriage none of them will divorce. Award-winning playwright and actor\n Harvey Fierstein once quipped that when gays can marry he is confident we\n will mess it up just as well as the heterosexual community.\n One of Dobson's favorite scare tactics is to suggest that gays and lesbians\n are pedophiles:\n We see it in the growing influence of the North\n American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) that\n shamelessly promotes sex between adults and children.\n Although this wretched organization has not been\n endorsed by most gay and lesbian publications, it has not\n been condemned by most of them either. That tells us a\n great deal.89\n Do you hear the not-so-subtle suggestion that most gays and lesbians are\n really in favor of child molestation? When will this toxic dishonesty end? I have\n treated registered sex-offenders in weekly cognitive-behavioral group therapy\n since 1997. Research findings clearly demonstrate that gays are no more likely\n to hurt children than non-gays\n \n http://www.soulforce.org/pdf/dobsonbooklet/strangescience.pdf",

   "James Dobson states that in many schools, traditional carols are now prohibited and the birth of Christ can not be mentioned. He states that bible reading and prayer in schools has been outlawed, and since 1980, the Ten Commandments could not be posted on bulletin boards. He state that the Ninth Circuit Court in California did its best to prohibit the words \"under God\" from being cited by children in the Pledge of Allegiance. He states that Easter has become \"Spring Break,\" and the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ cannot be celebrated. But Earth Day can be observed in the curricula. \"Father God\" is out and \"Mother Earth\" is in. He states that in the midst of all this secularism, some schools that are having a hard time teaching kids to read, write and compute are giving precious classroom time to homosexual propaganda. That was the observation that motivated James Dobsons remarks, about his so called statements concerning spongebob squarepants. If you believed the media after having heard him and read his books all these many years, the question I would ask is, \"Why?\" \n \n James Dobson urges parents to keep a close eye on thier sons and daughters. He wants them to watch carefully everything that goes into their little minds. He wants them to monitor their textbooks and the words of their teachers. He advises them not to turn their children over to harmful television programs. He states when God's name is used in vain, or when sex and violence come on the screen, turn off the tube and then read and discuss together the scriptures found in Psalm 103:1: \"I will set before my eyes no vile thing\" [NIV]. He advises reading uplifting and inspiring stories to your children daily. He states that this obligation to teach your children biblical truths continually is unmistakably written in Deuteronomy 6:6-8, which tells us: \n \n \"These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands, and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.\" [NIV]\n \n James Dobson wants to continue to help fulfill this task of bringing up our children \"in the fear and admonition of the Lord\" (Ephesians 6:4). \n James Dobson wants to continue to nourish and defend the institution of the family.\n \n http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/05/dobson.htm\n\n \n James Dobson wants one thing and one thing only: YOUR MONEY and the POWER it gives him to spread his filth of hatred to brainwashed people in order to get MORE MONEY and MORE POWER!!!!!!! Do you honestly think he gives ONE THOUGHT to you or your family?\n \n \n\"in the fear and admonition of the Lord\" (Ephesians 6:4).\n\n \n Sorry, but I reject ANY Lord that needs \"fear and admonition\" to rule. That is tyrannical and I will bend to no tyrant.",

If James Dobson is evil, then so is anyone else that has helped a lot of people but happens to have a mainstream conservative view of homosexuality. That includes most people. I don't know why you've chosen to make him such a target, but I suspect it's because he is a good example of how someone can not agree with your lobbyist views and still be a very humanitarian person. He is a walking example of how 'gay rights does not always coincide with humanitarianism.'\n \n \nIf he is willing to lie and twist research to further his agenda on gays, why wouldn't he lie about other stuff.\n\n \n I don't think he's intentionally lied about anything. I think YOU are intentionally trying to demonize him, which makes you the dishonest one regarding Dobson. Dobson is just professing and living out his beliefs--nothing dishonest or lying about that. I think you view him as an enemy because he doesn't buy the gay lobby talking points hook line, and sinker. What gets me is that there seems to be no room in your mind for the concept that people may not be 'lying' or 'twisting research' but that they may actually believe what they are reporting. It's not a matter of him being dishonest, it's a matter of him speaking what he truly believes to be the case. It's too bad that regarding Dobson's benevolencies and your obsession over his views on homosexuality, you refuse to see the forest of his life because of the trees.",

   "This sort of \"reasoning\" involves trying to discredit what a person might later claim by presenting unfavorable information (be it true or false) about the person. This \"argument\" has the following form: \n \n 1. Unfavorable information (be it true or false) about person A is presented. \n 2. Therefore any claims person A makes will be false. \n \n This sort of \"reasoning\" is obviously fallacious. The person making such an attack is hoping that the unfavorable information will bias listeners against the person in question and hence that they will reject any claims he might make. However, merely presenting unfavorable information about a person (even if it is true) hardly counts as evidence against the claims he/she might make. This is especially clear when Poisoning the Well is looked at as a form of ad Homimem in which the attack is made prior to the person even making the claim or claims. \n http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/poisoning-the-well.html",

If they're saying things that reflect badly on whatever it is you support, they're obviously \"biased\" and to be dismissed out of hand. \n \n Works on anything.\n\n \n Sort of like when gay rights people attack Dobson's material. \n \n What an ironic post.\n \n You know, it's not even than I'm a huge fan of Dobson or anything. (though I have read some of his books and articles.) I don't agree with all that he says. It's just that it's so obvious you all have targeted him and are going after him like attack dogs. You are simply completely wrong that he is known for his anti-gay stances--he's much better known for his work on marriage and parenting, period. I've listened to his radio show before and every now and then they might mention homosexuality, but 99% of the time it's about parenting and marriage issues. The reason I'm defending this so much is not so much that I'm a Dobson fan, but that I've heard his stuff and read it, and I just happen to know that the situation is not the way you all are portraying it. I KNOW because I HAVE heard and read Dobson. \n \n It's just hard to sit here and watch you all demonize this man and lie about him when I've seen with my own eyes and heard with my own ears that what you are saying just isn't true. And it doesn't bolster your position to go posting gay lobby website addresses about Dobson--it's hard to take some of them seriously based on their overall biased tone. All I know to say at this point is that if you REALLY want to see whether or not Dobson is the monster you are portraying him as, read his material and see for yourself (rather than taking the word of some websites out there). I suspect none of you have even read his material and you are commenting on it as if you know unequivocally that you are right. Listen to his radio show sometime. (Warning: it IS Christian-based, and he's going to be advising people to use Christian principles in parenting and marriage issues with their spouse, but that's much different than claiming it's blatantly anti-gay. I know some of you hate that sort of thing.) So far it seems that most of the arguments against Dobson here are based on what you see at his website. (Of course it's a matter of opinion on whether a lot of that stuff qualifies for being \"anti-gay\" in the first place.) I also noticed that when I did a search for \"homosexuality\" as you all are talking about, it brought up a lot more that just news stories, but also every single place the issue is even mentioned: even advertisements and acknowledgements of things like \"Coming Out Day.\" In other words, a lot of these aren't articles dedicated to the issue at all, and may just have the word itself somewhere in the text of the article.\n \n Let me also make one thing clear: I'm not saying Dobson is someone who doesnt' have the views you all are accusing him of. I'm simply saying that your portrayal of him as \"evil\" and having dedicated his life to hurt gay people, and the idea that going after gay people is his main work is just flat-out not accurate by what I've read and heard in his work.",

   "Then you must live in a vacume, Have you been to the site called the Family Research Council and searched homosexuality?\n \n Did you realize that Dobson is behind the family research council and it's works?\n\n \n I checked the leadership names of FRC and Dobson was nowhere to be found. (http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?c=TEAM_FRC)\n \n Look, Dobson may indeed be a contributor and have had a hand in the creation of FRC in 1980 (a lot has changed since then). I'm simply saying that by far, the bulk of Dobson's published work is about marriage and parenting--not fighting homosexuality. That's the truth and I've proven it here. Is he a bigot against homosexuals? Maybe, maybe not. I just know what he's written and what I've heard on his radio show.\n \n \nIf you come back after all this proof and say you don't see that he is the biggest homophobe walking and talking, your going on ignore.\n\n \n Go for it--if using the electronic equivilent of putting your fingers in your ears is your thing, have at it.
