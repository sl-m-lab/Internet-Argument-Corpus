If the world were synthetic that we were a part of, and it resulted in the exact same experiences we see today, there would be now way to tell the fake world from the real world... thus giving the POSSIBILITY of the world being fake. \n \n The synthetic doesn't have to be real... but since we could never know, there is always that possibility, hence, we can't actually KNOW anything is real. \n \n (real in regards to the physical world we interpret... we can know that we have thoughts, and sometimes even what those thoughts are... but that's where our absolute knowledge ends)",
