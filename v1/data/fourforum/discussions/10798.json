This is a most regrettable holding in a case where plaintiffs have alleged high-level U.S. government officials treated them as less than human.\" \n \n Eric Lewis, the Washington lawyer who argued the case for the detainees, said in a statement Friday, \"It is an awful day for the rule of law and common decency when a court finds that torture is all in a days' work for the secretary of defense and senior generals.\"\n\n \n So now not only are we arresting and detaining people indefinatly without any recourse, we have gone one step further and we are jsut going to say they are not even people. They are subhuman. \n \n Jsut as shocking, if not more so, is the contention that torture is just a routine and foreseeable consequence of being a POW or enemy combatant if you prefer that term. You would think that the fact we made it through 2 world wars and multiple smaller conflicts later without adopting such a stance would have some bearing on what would be \"forseeable\".",

   "ALSO FROM YOUR LINK ABOVE: http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/01/court_throws_out_islambased_gi.html#more Just for some balance mind you.\n Since the DNC Swamp won't ever talk to our soldiers....\n \n Here's a letter from an American servicewoman who served as a Gitmo guard.\n \"My daughter was in Gitmo for a year as a Master-at- Arms, E4. (10/04-10/05) She was injured several times by the inmates assaulting her physically. In addition, she knew that when she was doing her job by enforcing the rules, she was threatened by the prisoners if she had to touch them. They would get her. They mixed a cocktail of urine, feces, and semen, and let it fester for days until the right moment. They warned her that she was a target and then they got her, she was assaulted several times by loads of #### thrown at her.\n \n She had to undergo shots to prevent what diseases that she was exposed to. I don't know why we have women guarding men, especially these animals, but that is the policy. My daughter is a tough cookie and can handle herself. In her year there she did not dishonor herself or our country. When she returned home she had a DVD of Gitmo. They made fresh bread every day!! Part of it showed how the chef's prepared special meals for the prisoners. If a prisoner refused food the guards were happy to sample the Chicken, rice pilaf, yogurt and fresh baked pita bread, while our guys had #### food from the mess or had to buy it from Burger King.\n \n As part of her duties, in the last month she was there, she was assigned to the hospital ward. She had to force feed those a..holes who offed themselves the other day. They were the meanest of the bunch and had to be tied down to get their food. My daughter and other personnel voluntarily submitted themselves to the force feeding procedure also so that they could do it with the least pain for the captives. It was very unpleasant for her but it helped her and others to understand how to participate in it with the least stress for the recipients. The goal was to keep them alive. She feels that the suicides would not have happened on her watch, but it was going to happen eventually. These guys are warriors. By their death they have achieved a military success in the political world. The media marches on.\"\n \n Another Inconvenient Truth.\n (from michellemalkin.com)",

Nor, following the wars conclusion, where 'nazi sympathizers' prosecuted by law. \n \n Furthermore the assumption that people NOT charged with a crime automatically makes them innocent is asinine and shows an abundant lack of knowledge about legal systems and politics. \n Some who have been released and not 'charged' have gone on to be peaceful. Others have returned to fighting and terrorism.\n The UK has a tendency to being more liberal and pandering to it's muslim population, not prosecuting a few people due to potential fears of social unrest is a real possiblity especially considering the harm rioting caused in Paris not terribly long ago over other issues or even the CA. riots following the King verdict.\n You have no idea what harm local Muslims would cause if these people were tried. \n \n While Arch may be wrong in an assumption that one should act nice to be treated nice, I think both sides of this current discussion really don't see the forest for the woods and are pandering to their own preconcieved notions.\n \n People are 'persons'. If our laws prohibit us from torture, we shouldn't used it nor encourage others to do so. While I'd agree the constitution may not apply to the detainees, I do think that as a self-proclaimed moralistic people we should respect their religious beliefs and not use them as an interrogation tool.\n \n But, that aside, I believe terrorism is the tool of the winner and the one who's the most fanatic will eventually win (insert what ever conflict here). History has pretty much proven this.\n It's all about the will to fight and the will to do what ever it takes to win.\n And if your opponent is playing 'total war' and you're stuck thinking it's a nice game of tiddly winks, you've already lost.\n \n As Austin Powers would say \"Go Communism\"...erm, I mean \"Go Allah!\"",

You are correct in that if there was not sufficient evidence then he should not have been detained. However, if they did have sufficient evidence then he should have been tried for his alleged crimes.

Was never brought to court and the charge just faded away rather than being dropped.\n Was my 1st time being arrested, and being INNOCENT of this particular charge, figured it was preposterous how it was being handled by a rabid prosecutor who needed to 'build a case' against me as a justification for my detainment. One did not exist beyond someone's claims without evidence.\n \n Such events do happen.\n \n It is one of several reasons I no longer support the death penalty (even though I nominally believe some crimes warrant it). \n \n The detainees fall between the rock and the hard place.\n They can be classified as POWs, where well defined rules and regulations apply and treated as such, and detained indefinatly until the war on terror is over...meaning for the rest of their natural lives. And it would legitimate them (the real terrorists) andstate to others that if caught alive in this unconventional war, they'll be treated by the laws we follow but they don't have too.\n They can be classified as civilian criminals and dealt with as such. Meaning fairly well defined rules are applied. Meaning they'll have access to lawyers who'd have a field day making them out to be poor, innocent people caught in the vile rampage of the Bush admin...and how many here don't believe Bush is evil?\n \n I've learnt a lot about my experience. It may not apply to everyone but, for me, it's **** the system. There will be collateral damage to innocent people in ANY situation and the more viscious the combat the more damage done. \n Had I been a little lower on the economic ladder, I doubt I'd have as much 'luck' in surviving my event.\n But, I remind you, I am a US citizen living in the US. If crazy #### can happen to me, it certainly can happen to others.\n The best we can do is limit permanent damage done if you don't like this reality.\n Thus, death and torture should be removed.\n \n \n As to daewoo, It's NOT that such evil and ignorant people exist in America...its that some make it somehow to be US judges and law makers.\n But, while I'd echo your calls to pull it all down, I know full well that anything put back up in it's place will NOT be better and in all likelihood, be worse if history is one to go by.\n \n \n My only advice would be that if you're found to be in a situation where it's you against the 'authorities' to never speak to them and to always ask for a lawyer. 3 of my personal friends are police officers and 3 are lawyers too.\n It's something you have to train yourself to do.\n Like, when you're sleeping and the kids come in to ask you for something, you shouldn't respond in any other manner than to say NO!\n They're using inate psychological manipulation on you in a moment of weakness and incapacitation to get something out of you you'd not mormally allow.

That is how civilised society works.\n\n \n Here's the problem with your premise smiley, the vast majority of those Prisoners to the tune of probably 98% of them were picked right off the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, or caught in the act of, or after the fact of committing a terrorist attack. None of them were wearing the uniform of a legitimate Country at the time of their capture or they would have fallen under the rules of POW. \n \n No, these are committed Terrorists through and through. It is the other 2% who were arrested as suspected terrorists without having been actually caught committing a crime that are the grey cases I am willing to give SOME benefit of the doubt to. Just so were clear of who we're dealing with here.\n \n \nYou said in your previous post that you wished not to support alleged terrorists (presumably regardless of their innocence), but that you would rather keep these 'scumbags' locked up. Am I the only one to see the crass injustice in this statement. You have no interest in their guilt, you just want to lock them up and keep them there without any hope of release. Why not torture them for a laugh while we're about it - after all they're not really people anyway. If they are accused of crimes, they should be informed of their alleged crime, allowed access to legal counsel and tried appropriately. Anything else is simply not acceptable.\n\n \n I have made clear that I abhor the thought of truly innocent people being wrongfully held smiley, so please don't demonize me unfairly. My point is, if when the FBI investigated me, and in the process learned that I associated with numerous other people of Islamic descent who were on the International Terrorist Watch List, could I blame then for suspecting me of being an enemy of the State? I think not. So although i would support further investigation before throwing the key away, i think assuming them innocent considering how duplicitous terrorists are, would be foolish.\n \n After all, these aren't American criminals we are discussing here, but International War Criminals.\n \n \nAs for Arar, he was kidnapped and tortured without proof of his guilt (or any evidence as it turned out). You are correct in that if there was not sufficient evidence then he should not have been detained. However, if they did have sufficient evidence then he should have been tried for his alleged crimes. Your preposterous assertion that the system is working perfectly when innocent people are being detained without charge and subsequenty tortured says a great deal about your character and your lack of compassion for your fellow human beings.\n\n \n As I said, he isn't an American citizen nor is he committing a civilian crime. He is a suspected War Criminal so has no access to the civilian criminal courts.\n \n \nI can promise you that if the end really does come, you'll be burning along with the rest of us.\n \n Smiley\n\n \n Thanks for your candid opinion of my eternal condition smiley. But you don't understand how God deals differently with individuals and Nations. As an individual I am responsible for my life and my families security, which explains why I support my Countries War on Terror. But God empowers Government leaders to protect its citizens so allows War as a way to fight evil. And Islamofascism is evil smiley and need to be defeated before they destroy us which is their absolute intent.\n \n Now you can remain in denial all you like, but the day will come when their violence will get too close to you to continue to deny it. I guess some people just will never accept this threat until they smell the sulphur residue after the explosion.",

   "I wish there was a way to confirm for sure one way or the other with gray cases like this one.\n\n \n \"Police had no evidence linking Arar to terrorist activity yet they asked the U.S. to put him on a watch list as an \"Islamic extremist.\" \n \n \"The RCMP had no basis for this description, which had the potential to create serious consequences for Mr. Arar in light of American attitudes and practices,\" the report said in reference to the climate after 9-11.\"\n \n \"O'Connor said much of the material had not been double-checked to ensure its accuracy and reliability \"\n \n \"O'Connor concluded the inaccurate information passed by Canadian police to U.S. authorities \"very likely\" led to their decision to send Arar to Syria.\"\n \n \nI find it hard to believe that if he was being watched so closely, that our people weren't watching him in NYC though. That is what we don't know here on this debate forum.\n\n \"I am able to say categorically that there is no evidence to indicate that Mr. Arar has committed any offense or that his activities constitute a threat to the security of Canada,\" Commissioner Dennis O'Connor said in a three-volume report on the inquiry's findings\"\n \nWho did he meet with here, and was it really a legitimate business trip or something suspicious.\n\n Ok, you obviously never read either of those links I posted:\n \"he was detained at New York's Kennedy Airport on Sept. 26, 2002, during a stopover on his way home to Canada from vacation in Tunisia.\"\n \n \n \nIf he was meeting here to with suspicious islamics rather than IBM or some American Computer rep, then I am very suspicious of him. Especially since Canada took notice of him because he was meeting with someone on a terrorist watch list there.\n\n \"Arar met with another man who was under surveillance, a meeting Arar has said in interviews was merely about where to find inexpensive computer equipment.\"\n \n The guy's a software engineer who was looking to buy some cheap computer hardware. Why would he be holding meetings with IBM?\n \n \nMy point is that I hope he wasn't arrested and detained based on just one meeting with one suspicious character. I hope the authorities had multiple meetings with known radicals before doing what they did to him.\n\n \"Arar met with another man who was under surveillance, a meeting Arar has said in interviews was merely about where to find inexpensive computer equipment.\"\n \n \nIf they didn't have a high degree of quality evidence against him then they shouldn't have sent him to Syria at all, nor should they have detained him as they did.\n\n They (the US government) didn't have any evidence on him at all. The RCMP forwarded them a report saying that Arar had been seen talking to a suspect. For that, he was basically kidnapped from JFK airport on his way home from vacation and sent to a foreign country where he was tortured for over a year. Because he wanted to save a few bucks on some equipment for work.\n \n \nBut if they did have that type of evidence\n\n \"I am able to say categorically that there is no evidence to indicate that Mr. Arar has committed any offense or that his activities constitute a threat to the security of Canada,\" Commissioner Dennis O'Connor said in a three-volume report on the inquiry's findings\"\n \n \nthen what is happening now is unproductive slanderous propaganda\n\n Saying people should not be kidnapped, spirited out to a foreign country, and tortured for over a year is \"slanderous propoganda\"?\n \n \nthat is damaging a system that is actually working perfectly\n\n How do you know it's working perfectly? What's the conviction rate of these suspected terrorists? Oh, wait. No trials. In fact, you have no idea how many \"terrorists\" have been kidnapped, tortured, and released. We also have no idea how many actual terrorists have been captured, or if any useful information has been obtained, as this all falls under \"National security\"\n \n \nby exposing and catching a guy who is trying to do terrorist business between Canada and the US under the guise of a business man.\n\n And once more:\n \"he was detained at New York's Kennedy Airport on Sept. 26, 2002, during a stopover on his way home to Canada from vacation in Tunisia.\"\n He was not traveling to the US. He was returning to Canada from vacation, and had a stop over at JFK, where American authorities kidnapped him and sent him to a foreign country to be tortured. When asked by the Canadian government what had happened to him, the US wouldn't tell. Does that sound like it's on the up and up?",

I know it's Amnesty International, so you'll just dismiss it. But here is one from the National Journal.\n \n Extract\n \nShortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President Bush issued a military order that authorized the Defense Department to detain noncitizens suspected of having ties with Al Qaeda or other terrorists. As a result, hundreds of so-called \"enemy combatants\" were rounded up and taken to prisons in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Since early 2002, lawyers working on a volunteer basis have filed papers with U.S. courts asking the government to explain why it is holding individual prisoners. These habeas corpus petitions have forced disclosures by the Defense Department that shed light on some of the details surrounding the estimated 500 prisoners currently in U.S. captivity. \n\n So, these hundreds of people who were just rounded up, all just happened to be sitting on the battlefield did they? It was a military order from Bush to round them up. They weren't anywhere near any battlefield. They have had no charges laid against them, they have had no legal counsel, they have no right of appeal. If this were just 2% of those in the prison, then there would be more well over ten thousand people there (not non-people), but the figure is more like 5-600. So, please back up your ridiculous 98% figure, or admit that you're just inventing numbers to back up your monstrous regime.\n \n \nI have made clear that I abhor the thought of truly innocent people being wrongfully held smiley, so please don't demonize me unfairly. My point is, if when the FBI investigated me, and in the process learned that I associated with numerous other people of Islamic descent who were on the International Terrorist Watch List, could I blame then for suspecting me of being an enemy of the State? I think not. So although i would support further investigation before throwing the key away, i think assuming them innocent considering how duplicitous terrorists are, would be foolish.\n \n After all, these aren't American criminals we are discussing here, but International War Criminals.\n\n Well, my point was that you went from saying that they were suspected terrorists to saying that these scumbags should be kept locked up. Obviously you have no interest in their possible innocence whatsoever. As I have said, your disdain for your fellow human being is disgusting.\n \n \nAs I said, he isn't an American citizen nor is he committing a civilian crime. He is a suspected War Criminal so has no access to the civilian criminal courts.\n\n Does not being an American citizen make you less than human, rob you of any right to being treated with at least a modicum of respect? Is every other human being on the planet considered guilty until proven innocent? And you are correct, he was not committing a civilian crime, HE WAS COMMITTING NO CRIME AT ALL. Was it that which made him eligible for kidnapping and torture?\n \nThanks for your candid opinion of my eternal condition smiley. But you don't understand how God deals differently with individuals and Nations.

But God empowers Government leaders to protect its citizens so allows War as a way to fight evil.

You are not only responsible for those in your immediate family, your thoughts and sympathies should apply to everyone on this planet. The fact that you choose only to care about those in your immediate family, just reinforces my opinion of you. If anything, it is you who should be considered as less than human, and everything you type on this forum just makes the pile of evidence more enormous.\n \n \nNow you can remain in denial all you like, but the day will come when their violence will get too close to you to continue to deny it. I guess some people just will never accept this threat until they smell the sulphur residue after the explosion.\n\n You may be right, one day this violence may come to haunt me, but you can be sure that I will fight for justice now and even after that day rather than subjecting hundreds of innocent people to torture just to make me feel better.\n \n Smiley",

Near enough, I think. Evil, after all, isn't just an abstract entity floating about. It's people doing bad things. If a person isn't willing, for whatever reason, to stop themselves from being evil, then someone else will have to do it. And since many acts that we consider evil consist of taking things from others (property, liberty, life) it's quite reasonable to assume that an evil person could acquire power and \"triumph\" if not opposed. \n \n \n I absolutely agree and believe that adage is true. If good men do nothing to stop evil men, then what would possibly stop evil men from committing their atrocities ? We live in the real World, so nothing would stop them. Had no one intervened to stop Hitler, I believe he would have taken over all of Europe and thrust the World into a chasm of spiritual darkness like man has never seen before. And that's just one example of evil being stopped by good.\n __________________\n \"Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?\"\n \n Thomas Jefferson",

They are subhuman. \n \n Jsut as shocking, if not more so, is the contention that torture is just a routine and foreseeable consequence of being a POW or enemy combatant if you prefer that term. You would think that the fact we made it through 2 world wars and multiple smaller conflicts later without adopting such a stance would have some bearing on what would be \"forseeable\".\n\n \n Two wrongs don't make a right, so I'll not use the \"well, they do worse to our guys\" argument. We should never intentionally, without cause, mistreat prisoners (of war, or criminals)\n However, you've got to look at the case that they brought against the US and the officers. Of course, people that were held because they were at war with the US are going to make claims that they were mistreated. It's only common sense that they are going to whine and complain and make outrageous claims. But listen to what they say. They say that a Koran was thrown in the toilet. First of all, who cares. Really, if that's the worst, then so what. But look further. They HAD a copy of the Koran. If we're so intent to stopping their worshiping WHY would we give them a Koran in the first place? See where I'm going with this?\n \n Now, from what the story said, this suit was filed by 4 people that were released. Let go. When was the last time you heard of anyone coming out of being a prisoner of an Islamic group alive? Let alone that they got a copy of the bible and 3 or 4 meals a day. Most of the people is Gitmo were caught trying to kill innocent people. I'd say, by the standard of just about any war fought in the history of this planet, they are being treated much better than most of them deserve. If a few of them are mistaken identities or whatever, its very sad, and I'm sure that they'll get paid off handsomely. But again, I'd take anyone's claims of torture or innocence with a grain of salt. \n \n \n \n Now for the comment by Reina who said\n \n 2 years of silly war around those silly cartoons that are ridiculing Muhammad Islam zealots say.

And those rumours about preparing assassination of cartoonist are spread by US special service. That's some kind of black mail and demonstration to Europeans what furious Islam zealots are capable of. I regard that some indirect claim of acknowledging independent Kosovo by all Europeans. I'm afraid that such disturbances on strained pretexts would sweep across entire Europe.\n And here's the problem. For in fact those Albanians presented us ultimatum. They think that they can intimidate us and impose us their will. What their behavior would be when they'll gain their beloved independence? That would be a bomb. Albanian Kosovo is death for Christian Europe\n \n Notice that according to her it is 'stupid Danes' who commit 'dangerous provocation' so it's their fault that Islamic Fanatics are out wreaking havoc. Of course, it is the US special service and Albanian separatists' to blame as well causing the zealots, who can't help themselves, to go nuts. The lunacy is sickening.",

   "Things are changing from bad to worse in this country. I wonder why the theft of confidential data from state institutions has become the habitual practice just? I hope you are in the know about the present police probe into the theft of a confidential Home Office computer disk. Those thefts of sensitive data seem to be endless! Surely the disk was encrypted. But my buddy (who's actually a computer wizard) asserts that disks with even sophisticated level of encryption are accessible sooner or later. Can you be sure the data hasn't ended up in the wrong hands? Me not. \n Now ... in Britain you can't be sure of anything actually, personal safety including. Our govt headed by that looser G. Brown is gust gathering of corrupted beasts making hot money even by trading titles. Most irritating is that our precious secret services are staying idle amid that mess. They seem to be more and more involved in political matters than doing their original job and that is defending us, me and you. And our primer is busy trying to please America. That's all.\n IMHO we need a new primer and a new govt and a new MI-5 and whatever to feel safe and sound in the UK! Otherwise we'll see the same vicious circle and .... expect more bad news then.",
