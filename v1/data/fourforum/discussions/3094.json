If you mean absolute, i.e. like a mathematical proof, not, most things in life are NOT proven like a math proof. We generally just require sufficient evidence. For really important things, we also require many experts to examine the evidence and provide rational reasons why or why not it supports the theory. In this case, evolution has indeed been proven. Likewise, it has never been disproven. Science is rarely \"proven\", in your classical sense. ANY scientific theory or law can be overturned through sufficient evidence, by ANYONE.

   "This is, as you've obviously forgotten, (so keen are you at ad hominem), the core of the debate - the pursuit of the knowledge of aliens\n Talkorigins says...\n \"The primary function of science is to demonstrate the existence of phenomena that cannot be observed directly.\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/sciproof.html\n Another definition might be...\n \"Science is the concerted human effort to understand, or to understand better, the history of the natural world and how the natural world works, with observable physical evidence as the basis of that understanding 1. It is done through observation of natural phenomena, and/or through experimentation that tries to simulate natural processes under controlled conditions\"\n http://www.gly.uga.edu/railsback/1122science2.html\n Yet, scientists can be experts in the field of exobiology, that is, the biology of aliens. Further, they can harness millions of dollars tuning into the universe with the sole purpose of finding proof of these aliens.\n\n \n It's a theoretical field, this is a new concept to you? That's OK if it is, I'm not being trite.\n \n \nI forgot to include arrogant and rude. I tell you plainly not to continue this line of insulting my intelligence.

You mean where you have evidence to back your claims? This should be good.\n \n \nWhat evidence do you have for love? I guess it doesn't exist for you.\n\n \n Yet another example of you either not reading responses, or not absorbing them.

We can both talk about each other's emotive responses...or we can leave a little slack for it and proceed with the debate rather than the discussion of human weakness in getting emotional.\n \n \nWhat I can't understand is the absolute false logic in establishing that I have no evidence for my beliefs. There are loads of other forms of evidence, such as eye-witnesses, etc. But hey, I've been over this before. You ignore it, simply because you want to continually talk to me as if I have no intelligence. It is so easy to create an ivory tower. It is safer than addressing issues. \n\n \n Dangerous! Bringing up evidence as the backing of your belief system which requires no evidence. Absolute false logic...we'll get to it.\n LOADS of other forms of evidence. Eye-witnesses, etc.\n I like the etc. part after eye-witnesses, I use etc. too, but let's see if you can elaborate for the readers here. Been over this before? I have yet to be involved in a thread where you lay out your beliefs, and provide evidence for them. You may tell by my reaction now, that I'm keenly aware of that, and practically drooling with anticipation.\n \n Please, in numbered fashion, elaborate on first your premise, then the evidence to back it. Instead of \"eye-witnesses, etc.\", I'd like to see links or names, or names/dates, etc. If we can get to the bottom of this, we might actually get somewhere. I suggest it have it's own response thread, so we don't miss it.\n \n \nWhat is the problem with debating the lack of evidence scientists have for exobiology? Is it embarrasing to you? It shouldn't be, scientists are driven by beliefs.\n\n Here is where I'd normally get frustrated. I'll tell you why. Because this is also the third time I find myself being questioned about something I have answered no less than 2 times in this same thread.\n \n Exobiologists are not claiming anything they are theorizing on to be \"true\", or worthy of \"belief\". It is science fiction, while trying to be predicitive using science we have now, to describe the plethora of organisms we can study on earth. They need no \"evidence\", because they aren't claiming anything to be true or worthy of belief. Your religion, on the other hand, does claimg things to be both truth, and worthy of belief. I need to know, do you agree or disagree with this? If you don't agree, I'm at a loss, since I don't see how this is an opinion piece.\n \n \n another attempt at re-working my beliefs. At least you are persistent. My religious dogma makes no claims to gravitational force. This doesn't mean I don't believe it exists. It will of course be more convenient for you to ignore this and to keep addressing me as your stereotype.\n\n Gravity isn't contradictory to your dogma. Of course you don't have to not believe it. Why would you? I'm not stereotyping you, I have been reading and debating with you for quite some time, I'm way, way past the point of stereotyping. You know some of my beliefs, I know some of yours...let's not label me as sterotyping again please.\n \n \n\n Yes, it is rather emotive. Tell me where I have argued that Orthodoxy denies gravity, or electo-magnetic force. But oops, now I've take then bait. I respond to your straw-man. Don't worry, I bring this back to the actual topic.\n But wWhat's this 'us' business? First you can't speak for Kronus, now you're of one mind? \n And when are you going to define your new version of the term 'height'? :)\n\n Don't drag in a straw-man. Both of those, gravity and EMF do not, on the surface, contradict anything in your religion. I do agree however, that back to the topic is good.\n \n \n\n But despite this, I don't think it's falsifiable, therefore not science, but do scientists think it is science? Yes.

They were witnesses to Jesus' miracles.\n You will just say 'it's not evidence' because it doesn't accord to your version of evidence, or can't be tested by your version of evidence. I've already pointed out that I consider your notion circular. Should I re-post these arguments again? If you want, I can point to the Bible passages.

Tell me where I have argued that Orthodoxy denies gravity, or electo-magnetic force. But oops, now I've take then bait. I respond to your straw-man. Don't worry, I bring this back to the actual topic.\n But What's this 'us' business? First you can't speak for Kronus, now you're of one mind? \n And when are you going to define your new version of the term 'height'? \n\n \nDon't drag in a straw-man.\n\n It is not a straw-man. You said that height can be both measured, and it can't be. I simply what you to clarrify what you mean by this, or withdraw it. It is not a straw-man if you actually said it!\n Go back to the \"Which are you?\" thread of the Evolution debate.\n Ursus said that love is akin to height.\n I said love is abstract and can't be measured (which you say 'it can' but are yet to show this), and that height can be measured. Therefore the analogy is false.\n You chimed in Post 53\n \nAnd I question your sanity. \n No, not everyone can measure height scientifically. We can measure height scientifically because we have done the science to be able to. We have not finished the science to be able to quantify the human mind. It's quite complex. Even the simplest life forms are still beyond our ken, while the space shuttle, the most complex machine ever built by humans, is achievable, we cannot create even the simplest life from scratch. We have a long way to go. But our journey so far has answered a lot of historically unknown things, hasn't it? However, there is also nothing that would indicate the riddle of neurology cannot one day be much closer to completion. And nothing to indicate there is anything outside the physical world, making the bundle of nerve fibers and electrical impulses behave a certain way. Are you impatient waiting for the answers and feel compelled to believe in something rather than face the unknown? Don't feel bad, most every superstision results from wanting to identify the fearful unknown. And that process to is most likely a result of evolution...\n\n That is your answer - we don't know, but one day we might. So admitting here that you can't measure love, but perhaps one day you might, you believe that that equates to 'evidence' for love.\n \nBoth of those, gravity and EMF do not, on the surface, contradict anything in your religion. I do agree however, that back to the topic is good.\n\n Good, but I still would like your version of 'height'. If you believe, as you stated, that has immeasurable qualities, then do you believe that those qualities exist? If they do, how does science tell you that they exist, if they can't be measured? Or are you saying something else? This is now the fourth time I've asked you to elaborate.\n \nBut despite this, I don't think it's falsifiable, therefore not science, but do scientists think it is science? Yes. If you want to debate this, then feel free to do so. I expect, like Kronus you will attack me. It is far easier to do. But you have been warned repeatedly here.\n\n Thank you with sharing your straw-man ideas about what you think I believe - with regards to religion. Does it address anything to do with this thread? No. As stated on the evolutionary debates it seems to be the tactic of shouting-down posters with personal abuse.\n I don't mean to make you feel so threatened.

You either:\n Do not understand the difference between fiction and non-fiction.\n\n It's a nice way of avoiding the evidence I cited. Ironic that you crow about evidence, I post citations of scientists who believe their undertakings are science, and you retort what with? Evidence? NO! Rhetorical devices, emotive pleas, personal abuse. Then you debate that it is both 'science' and also 'science fiction'.\n science fiction\n n. \n A literary or cinematic genre in which fantasy, typically based on speculative scientific discoveries or developments, environmental changes, space travel, or life on other planets, forms part of the plot or background.\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=science%20fiction\n Not only do you have a different use of the word 'height', to what I understand, but you have a different usage of 'science fiction'. It would help if you elaborate on this too.\n \nORYou are using a strawman here, claiming that because something is deemed to be in one example, placed in the classification of \"science\", that it is somehow inconsistent with rational beliefs.\n\n There are many things that scientists are engaged in that I don't agree with - in case you've missed it; EVOLUTION. If you want other examples; I would classify experiments on humans as science, if it is done in a scientific way; as done by Nazi scientists. Would I argue that it is irrational? Yes, of course I would. Even though it might literally be done 'in a rational way'. A butcher (of people) who is methodical is still a butcher.\n Should oneassume therefore that you accept everything a scientist does do as both being rational, and worthy, simply because it's done by scientists.\n \nI cannot see a third alternative, well, I can, but let's stick to those two.\n\n I've just provided one you didn't think of.

   "I still await your response to the Mach Theory of Height?(see below)\n\n \n What are you talking about? First, height, in the general sense, can easily be measured if it's defined on a scale we can measure. If you get increasingly smaller in your scale, down to where quantum mechanics reigns, then no, I don't think you can measure, exactly, anything. Heisenberg uncertainty principle I think I'm referring to.\n \n \nYet another example of you re-posting a dead link. How does this answer my question?\n\n http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/w_k_clifford/ethics_of_belief.html\n You wanted a more robust definition of why one can believe in love, here it is again.\n \n \nAnd how is it measured? Where is the 'scale of love'? Just saying it can be done does not prove it. In effect though your post here says 'everyone agrees to it, therefore it's real'. What is the 'evidence' you accept here as efficient? Well aside from an un-stated way of measuring love, you accept personal experiences as evidence. That's what your site says \"I experience it, others experience it'.\n Why don't you actually present the 'evidence' as you suggest 'evidence' is?\n\n Read link above. I have asked you time and time again for YOUR definition of love, so that I can proceed to show you why one can believe it without being irrational. You refuse. So, I'll finish the definition for you since you forfeit.\n \n You would first need to rule out parsimony in your debate. There has been consistent evidence, in any neurology text, that indicates everything in the brain, as we might assume anyway, is based on physical processes. To claim \"love cannot be measured\", means you are claiming it's beyond the physical. And you will first need to show this, before you can continue to debate how to measure something, that I presume you believe, is outside the physical world. \n \n Do you mean love of family and friends?\n Love of mate?\n Love of cooking?\n \n You shouldn't even answer, because as I've clearly stated, you will first need to give us some reason to presume that love exists outside the physical world. And that's a tall order. Then you would need to agree that the way one person defines love \"increased heart rate, flushing of the skin, a feeling of euphoria caused by endorophin release\", is not YOUR definition of love, etc. But again...we don't need to go there, you have to get past the first hurdle.\n \n \n \nYes and you do ignore answers, you post non-links, and you provide a just-so statement based not on 'evidence' as you've been crowing on about, but personal experience. If you could focus on a line of argument, that would be great.\n\n My original argument was quite focused. Only in responding to you do reponses seem to spread out, as indicated by other frustrated posters on this board.\n \n \nI already provided a statement about the Apostles on an evolutionary thread. They were witnesses to Jesus' miracles.\n You will just say 'it's not evidence' because it doesn't accord to your version of evidence, or can't be tested by your version of evidence. \n \n \n If all you require is eye-witness and a book, I can, given any arugment you (or anyone on earth for that matter) present me with, go type a short \"book\", and gather some dead eye-witnesses, and be considered rational, and my conclusions be considered worthy of belief. Not sure how you're going to recover from that mishap.\n \n \n \nSee above. I don't think you want to debate though. You seem to accept 'evidence' (I must put it in parenthesis because it's so fluid a form, with you) when you are faced with thing such as 'love', 'ideas' etc.\n\n \n I have what I call, in the english language, ideas. I can talk to any number of humans in english and probably get 1000/1000 reponses that they too experience what we call \"ideas.\" I can experience it, it's verified by probably everyone on earth, except for those that are either developmentally too young, too old, or otherwise incapable of thinking or communicating their thoughts, or lack therof.\n \n Does a person with severe brain damage that results in a vegetative state have thoughts? How about when monitor no brain activity but keep the body alive? What? You mean these crazy concepts like love, ideas, require a physical brain to function through impulses and chemical reactions? Outrageous? I think not. Parsimony points to that being exactly right, yet your premise that love, ideas are not results of the physical world HAS to be supported before you proceed. Don't bother with specifics, begin with one or the other. Either that you think there is sufficient reason to believe love is or has components outside the physical world, or that it resides in the physical world.\n \n \n \nYes, repeating your notion that it is science fiction flies in the face of the citations I gave that those engaged in it, believe it to be science. They have the backing of science institutions, such as NASA. It is odd that you are here trying to belittle their efforts and repeating your opinion is of course your way of 'debate'.\n I understand that they are theorising on what aliens might be like. How is that science? Why is it more scientific then theorising on what fairies look like?\n\n Science fiction: A form of fiction that draws imaginatively on scientific knowledge and/or speculation.  \n \n What do you mean by fairie? You mean supernatural I assume. Then yes, hypothesizing about the supernatural is not based on science, since science deals with the physical world. No ambiguity there I hope.\n \n \n \nIt is not a straw-man. You said that height can be both measured, and it can't be. I simply what you to clarrify what you mean by this, or withdraw it. It is not a straw-man if you actually said it!\n Go back to the \"Which are you?\" thread of the Evolution debate.\n Ursus said that love is akin to height.\n I said love is abstract and can't be measured (which you say 'it can' but are yet to show this), and that height can be measured. Therefore the analogy is false.\n You chimed in Post 53\n\n Answered above. If it exists in the physical world, it can, to some degree, be measured. \n \n \nThat is your answer - we don't know, but one day we might. So admitting here that you can't measure love, but perhaps one day you might, you believe that that equates to 'evidence' for love.\n\n Depends on your definition of love. I've already shown evidence for a broad definition. However, if you want to be more precise, truly know something in the physical world requires being able to describe it mathematically. So to the extreme, most things we say we know, we cannot use this method on. If that's too confusing than ignore it. Believing or not believing it will have no impact on the points you've made. I'm not a physicist, so one more well-read on the subject might correct either you or I here, but again, it has no impact either way.\n \n \nt's a nice way of avoiding the evidence I cited. Ironic that you crow about evidence, I post citations of scientists who believe their undertakings are science, and you retort what with? Evidence? NO! Rhetorical devices, emotive pleas, personal abuse. Then you debate that it is both 'science' and also 'science fiction'.\n science fiction\n n. \n A literary or cinematic genre in which fantasy, typically based on speculative scientific discoveries or developments, environmental changes, space travel, or life on other planets, forms part of the plot or background.\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=science%20fiction\n Not only do you have a different use of the word 'height', to what I understand, but you have a different usage of 'science fiction'. It would help if you elaborate on this too.\n\n Already answered this above, please scroll up if it's been forgotten.\n \n \nThere are many things that scientists are engaged in that I don't agree with - in case you've missed it; EVOLUTION. If you want other examples; I would classify experiments on humans as science, if it is done in a scientific way; as done by Nazi scientists. Would I argue that it is irrational? Yes, of course I would. Even though it might literally be done 'in a rational way'. A butcher (of people) who is methodical is still a butcher.\n Should oneassume therefore that you accept everything a scientist does do as both being rational, and worthy, simply because it's done by scientists.\n\n No, it's the process, not the person(s), that I feel is worthy. I don't know the people. Some might be crazy.\n I don't think all scientists are always \"rational\", that would be silly.\n I don't think human experimentation is \"irrational.\" Criminal, and nauseating, yes, but not by definition irrational.\n Not agreeing with evolution is fine. But if you want to proceed with rational thinking, it will take you places you don't agree with. Until you loosen that yoke (of not accepting conclusions you might disagree with based on some other belief), you cannot proceed and MUST accept irrational belief and/or behavior. Irrelevant though, to this point.\n \n \nI've just provided one you didn't think of. Education free of charge.\n I am glad to educate you.\n\n This is insulting to me. But again, agree to disagree on the emotive, cut some slack, and let's proceed. If you have not noticed, I've attempted to \"tone down\" the emotional responses, let's see if you can do the same.\n \n \nI look forward to you providing evidence that the search for aliens is not scientific based on your statement that it is science fiction, as opposed to re-stating your opinion ad infinitum. I understand the difference between evidence and opinion.\n I also look forward to you showing how love is measured\n\n Read more. Science fiction definition I already posted, that's why it's called, science  fiction.\n \n No, I don't feel you understand the difference between evidence and opinion, based on your post. \n \n Your stated your evidence is a dead eye-witness, which is frankly your opinion that they existed. And coupled with that opinion, your opinion that what they wrote or dictated was indeed truth. The second is the least defendable, the first we could possibly prove if we had enough historical documents and if they existed. \n \n This is why I don't look up a dead person, quote them in a book, and then hand it to you as \"evidence\". \n \n -Mach",

   "I still await your response to the Mach Theory of Height?(see below) \n\n \nWhat are you talking about?\n\n I ask for clarification on a point. It's only taken several days to get around to this. But I go into this more below... if I can ask for your indulgence.\n \nFirst, height, in the general sense, can easily be measured if it's defined on a scale we can measure. If you get increasingly smaller in your scale, down to where quantum mechanics reigns, then no, I don't think you can measure, exactly, anything. Heisenberg uncertainty principle I think I'm referring to.\n\n Cool. Gelick in \"Chaos\" talks about the immeasurable surface area of a table.\n So, do you believe that the immeasurable aspects of it don't exist? I ask because you suggest that evidence (in the forms of science proof) is what you accept as something exists. Given that height has two natures (analogous to man having spiritual as well as physical natures), you seem to accept both, even though one is evidenced.\n It is good to draw an inference of one, from the knowledge of the other. :)\n \nYet another example of you re-posting a dead link. How does this answer my question? \n\n \n http://www.infidels.org/library/his..._of_belief.html \n You wanted a more robust definition of why one can believe in love, here it is again.\n\n More robust? All you've given is a dead-link and an idea that it can be measured, and is 'true' based on common experience. Okay now I've got a link that works, I'll read it...\n passing time, humming music as Montalban reads site\n Okay...\n I find this most amusing. I ask for scientific proof on the measurability of love, and you present a philosophical debate.\n Where is the science?\n \nAnd how is it measured? Where is the 'scale of love'? Just saying it can be done does not prove it. In effect though your post here says 'everyone agrees to it, therefore it's real'. What is the 'evidence' you accept here as efficient? Well aside from an un-stated way of measuring love, you accept personal experiences as evidence. That's what your site says \"I experience it, others experience it'.\n Why don't you actually present the 'evidence' as you suggest 'evidence' is? \n\n \nRead link above. I have asked you time and time again for YOUR definition of love, so that I can proceed to show you why one can believe it without being irrational. You refuse. So, I'll finish the definition for you since you forfeit.\n\n No, this is still one of your goal shifts. Any definition I bring forward about God is love will fall on the sword of your artificial constraints for evidence -that there is no God.\n In effect I would have to provide a scientific definition of love, based on tests - which don't exist - because science doesn't/hasn't tested for love - even when you cite 'evidence' for love as found by science you present general consensus of people's experiences, and a philosophical debate.\n \n You would first need to rule out parsimony in your debate. There has been consistent evidence, in any neurology text, that indicates everything in the brain, as we might assume anyway, is based on physical processes. To claim \"love cannot be measured\", means you are claiming it's beyond the physical. And you will first need to show this, before you can continue to debate how to measure something, that I presume you believe, is outside the physical world.\n\n Here's your best argument? That one day science might find an answer. Given that it hasn't now, and you believe that science is the arbiter of what 'is', then love 'is not' for the present.\n The difference between 'love' and 'height' is that we have some tests for 'height', some aspect is measurable. I don't know of any for 'love'.\n \nYou shouldn't even answer, because as I've clearly stated, you will first need to give us some reason to presume that love exists outside the physical world. And that's a tall order. Then you would need to agree that the way one person defines love \"increased heart rate, flushing of the skin, a feeling of euphoria caused by endorophin release\", is not YOUR definition of love, etc. But again...we don't need to go there, you have to get past the first hurdle.\n\n If you believe love exists 'in the physical world' show me the tests for it.\n I would like to see any test at all that you have, for any definition. If you believe that love is but a matter of chemicals, then I'd be interested to hear this too. But I think there's a difference between stimuli and stimulus here. I can, in my weaker moments, see a beautiful woman on the street, and be aroused. You can measure the physical aspects, but it still doesn't explain why I'm aroused by this particular woman, and not another; not just her appearance, but other non-materialistic factors are at work. I would expect otherwise one could come up with a scientific rule of thumb over which woman I would love - a prediction based on a scientific hypothesis.\n \nYes and you do ignore answers, you post non-links, and you provide a just-so statement based not on 'evidence' as you've been crowing on about, but personal experience. If you could focus on a line of argument, that would be great. \n\n \nMy original argument was quite focused. Only in responding to you do responses seem to spread out, as indicated by other frustrated posters on this board.\n\n Nice to be able to speak for everyone.\n \nI already provided a statement about the Apostles on an evolutionary thread. They were witnesses to Jesus' miracles.\n You will just say 'it's not evidence' because it doesn't accord to your version of evidence, or can't be tested by your version of evidence. \n\n \nIf all you require is eye-witness and a book, I can, given any argument you (or anyone on earth for that matter) present me with, go type a short \"book\", and gather some dead eye-witnesses, and be considered rational, and my conclusions be considered worthy of belief. Not sure how you're going to recover from that mishap.\n\n This sort of stuff was dealt with hundreds of years ago...\n \"It is not perhaps without good reason that we attribute to simple-mindedness a readiness to believe anything and to ignorance the readiness to be convinced, for I think I was once taught that a belief is like an impression stamped on our soul: the softer and less resisting the soul, the easier it is to print anything on it...On the other hand there is a silly arrogance in continuing to disdain something and to condemn it as false just because it seems unlikely to us. That is a common vice among those who think their capacities are above the ordinary\". \n \"That it is madness to judge the true and the false from our own capacities\", Michel de Montaigne (1993), \"The Essays: A Selection\", Penguin Classics, p74. \n and\n \"When we read in Bouchet about miracles associated with the relics of Saint Hilary we can shrug it off: His right to be believed is not great enough to take away our freedom to challenge him. But to go on from there and condemn all similar accounts seems to me to be impudent in the extreme. Such a great saint as Augustine swears that he saw: a blind child restored to sight by the relics of Saint Gervaise and Saint Protasius at Milan; a woman in Carthage cured of a cancer by the sign of the cross made by a woman who had just been baptised; his close friend Hesperius driving off devils (who were infesting his house) by using a little soil taken from the sepulchre of our Lord, and that same soil, borne into the Church, suddenly curing a paralytic; a woman who, having touched the reliquary of Saint Stephen with a posy of flowers during a procession, rubbed her eyes with them afterwards and recovered her sight which she had recently lost... What are we to accuse him of - hum and the two holy bishops, Aurelius and Maximinus, whom he calls on as witnesses? Is it of ignorance, simple-mindedness, credulity, deliberate deception or imposture? .... 'Qui, ut rationem mullan afferent, ipsa auhtoritate me frangerent (Why, even if they gave no reasons, they would convince me by their very authority) \n Michel de Montaigne in \"That it is madness to judge the true and the false from our own capacities\"\n Sometimes the authority of the witness is enough.\n But tell me, how would you gather dead eye-witnesses? I'm not sure how you'd do that.\n But even in courts today eye-witnesses are accepted as evidence. Sometimes it's the only evidence.\n \nSee above. I don't think you want to debate though. You seem to accept 'evidence' (I must put it in parenthesis because it's so fluid a form, with you) when you are faced with thing such as 'love', 'ideas' etc. \n\n \nI have what I call, in the English language, ideas\n\n Where dot they exist in the physical world?\n \n I can talk to any number of humans in English and probably get 1000/1000 responses that they too experience what we call \"ideas.\" I can experience it, it's verified by probably everyone on earth, except for those that are either developmentally too young, too old, or otherwise incapable of thinking or communicating their thoughts, or lack thereof.\n\n Ah-ha! We have a break-through. So, if a given number of people believe it, then even without science, it is real. So 'evidence' as brought about through means of your version of science (your philosophy of science) is not always needed.\n \nDoes a person with severe brain damage that results in a vegetative state have thoughts? How about when monitor no brain activity but keep the body alive? What? You mean these crazy concepts like love, ideas, require a physical brain to function through impulses and chemical reactions? Outrageous? I think not. \n\n Do you know of people who were deemed 'dead' and then 'returned'?\n \nParsimony points to that being exactly right, yet your premise that love, ideas are not results of the physical world HAS to be supported before you proceed. Don't bother with specifics, begin with one or the other. Either that you think there is sufficient reason to believe love is or has components outside the physical world, or that it resides in the physical world.\n\n I believe God exists in the physical world. In the same sense that people might see a ghost that leaves 'no trace' other than upon their own experience. Likewise love can exist in the physical world, emanating from God (who is love). But you make a mistake in your logic. I am not the one who is arguing that I only believe that which science can test. If science can't test love, wherever it is, doesn't affect my belief in it.\n It is in fact the Orthodox mind-set. We are a ?mysterious? church in that we don?t come up with formula about God ? though we do have certain ideas ? we don?t expect to say ?this is all that God is? because God by His very nature will never be known fully to us. So, you need be mindful in applying your ?rules? for what are accepted to me, in so far as demanding me to define things. It is not I who rests my knowledge on the confines of science, but you.\n \nYes, repeating your notion that it is science fiction flies in the face of the citations I gave that those engaged in it, believe it to be science. They have the backing of science institutions, such as NASA. It is odd that you are here trying to belittle their efforts and repeating your opinion is of course your way of 'debate'.\n I understand that they are theorising on what aliens might be like.

You mean supernatural I assume. Then yes, hypothesizing about the supernatural is not based on science, since science deals with the physical world. No ambiguity there I hope.\n\n There is a theory that when people dealt with 'gods' in ages past, that these were nothing but aliens, who would appear 'god like' to some. Fairies need not be super-natural. Why not give scientists millions of dollars to speculate that they are in deed material beings?\n \nIt is not a straw-man.

Supernatural is not like \"What we know\". It's outside of our knowledge, there is nothing, anywhere, to indicate something exists outside the physical world (Parsimony too applies here), so there is no reason, without either of the other two criteria fulfilled, to believe in it.\n \n \nMore robust?

I ask for scientific proof on the measurability of love, and you present a philosophical debate.\n Where is the science?\n\n I think we're not communicating on \"science\". Science is a method, a process. We have some math forumals and such for the theory of special relativity, but we call it a theory. Much of science is theory, but it's based on the scientific process. Big difference. It can be argued, although I have no use for the argument, that nothing can be \"known\", for we cannot even define \"known\", therefore there is no such thing as \"proof\", etc. Everything then becomes a moot point. I think to have meaningful debate, we have to accept the premise that some things \"can be known\". Otherwise, it's again, like telling a doctor she cannot work on a patient because she doesn't KNOW the cure will work and wont' kill the patient. She most certainly DOESN'T know this, but with science, you at least have a foundation to both work from, and to build upon.\n \n Back to nothing can be known, can reduce, everything, including science, to a \"philosophy\". But again, this gets us nowhere in the real world, we seem to do a little better when we DO and think, rather than just think :) Once we accept that we can know things that the physical world is indeed observable, then we can proceed to make progress in describing what exists. This process of observation and knowledge building is a specific philosophy, not a general \"philosophy\", that applies to science. We cannot equate a philosophy of religion to a philosophy of science in an attempt to invalidate one or the other. Nor could we take a philosophy of \"why milkshakes are delicious\", and attempt to compare it to the philosophy of science and try to invalidate science by saying since it cannot show beyond a doubt that you think a milkshake is delicious, that it's somehow not valuable and consistent. (actually there is no reason it COULDn'T, one day tell you the milkshake was delicious, but not today. However, since it's \"like what we know now\", and through parsimony, we can make an educated, rational guess, that it \"can be known\")\n \n \n \n \n \nNo, this is still one of your goal shifts. Any definition I bring forward about God is love will fall on the sword of your artificial constraints for evidence -that there is no God.\n In effect I would have to provide a scientific definition of love, based on tests - which don't exist - because science doesn't/hasn't tested for love - even when you cite 'evidence' for love as found by science you present general consensus of people's experiences, and a philosophical debate.\n\n No, its not just a general consensus, it's a combination of things.\n \n #1 I experience it. I can read any number of sources from history through present that also seem to \"share\" my experience just as I describe it myself.\n #2 I can ask any number of capable individuals if they also experience such things and they can confirm or deny it. \n #3 I cannot imagine a \"good\" reason why anyone would lie about experiencing \"ideas\", on average.\n #4 Ideas seem to form part of our consciousness, throughout the world there is evidence of manipulation by humans which would require, in some definition, the formation of ideas.\n #5 we can define love as a set of physical and/or behavioral reponses. I.e. increased hearbeat, flush skin, endorphin release, subject A will, while in this \"love\" state (can be a short time or long time eh?) will listen the other persons problems, talk fondly of them when they aren't around, etc. We can than run around and test this. Perfect? Of course not, again, in the end, nothing can be \"known\". Sufficient? Of course.\n \n \n That's a robust list! And yes, it can be termed \"scientific\", because it follows certain methods and testability criteria, etc. You CAN examine religion using science, but it always turns up the same answer..does not compute. I.e. there is no evidence, and it's like nothing that we currently \"know\", so there is not reason to belive.\n \n \nHere's your best argument? That one day science might find an answer. Given that it hasn't now, and you believe that science is the arbiter of what 'is', then love 'is not' for the present.\n The difference between 'love' and 'height' is that we have some tests for 'height', some aspect is measurable. I don't know of any for 'love'.\n Similar to the above explanations of how science is not a final stake in the ground that says \"without a doubt, this is TRUE\". It's open to correction from anyone, at anytime, as long as it's based on reason and the criteria for science.\n \n \nIf you believe love exists 'in the physical world' show me the tests for it.\n I would like to see any test at all that you have, for any definition. If you believe that love is but a matter of chemicals, then I'd be interested to hear this too. But I think there's a difference between stimuli and stimulus here. I can, in my weaker moments, see a beautiful woman on the street, and be aroused. You can measure the physical aspects, but it still doesn't explain why I'm aroused by this particular woman, and not another; not just her appearance, but other non-materialistic factors are at work. I would expect otherwise one could come up with a scientific rule of thumb over which woman I would love - a prediction based on a scientific hypothesis.\n\n \n Why do you think that last line? The problem here is that you don't accept that it's OK to not know the answer to everything. This is what many in philosophy call \"humility\". Science cannot touch a lot of things. We can't even adequately describe everything about gravity, yet we witness it's affects every day. It's like a cone of knowledge, standing on the base like a tepee. The parts that we can uncover with our meager human intelligence and science starts at the little bitty tip at the top, and we work our way down, slowly. There may even be a limit to how much we can \"know\". But suffice to say we work from the beginning, and make forward progress.\n \n \n Secondly, you will need to break out of superstitious beliefs, where when we don't understand something, we attribute it to something supernatural. That's a human reaction, but we can think beyond it now that we know a thing or two. Primitives had no idea what lighting was and assumed it was from the gods. Wow the sun is a fiery globe, must BE a god. Well, once we build our knowledge base, we come to realize a better way to describe these things, that indeed fall within the physical world. We've been doing this for a short time relatively speaking (thousands of years), but we've already made huge leaps in understanding and have removed the supertnatural from where it did not belong.\n \n Point being. There is nothing that indicates that a human behavioral response in particular, what you're describing as love, has any component that points to it being outside the physical world. In fact, we do know some of the components of this \"love\", as I mentioned before. Behavior...which we can show some behaviors as part of our genetic makeup. Parsimony suggests that indeed, there is no reason it wouldn't also be similar. Change in the physical states of the brain. We can and do measure some of these. And that's from the physical side. From the theoretical (math) side, we can also, as Ursus points out, use things like competitive game theory to show a cause for the advantage that a behavior like love can give a competing population. For example, would you guess our civilization (population) would do better with or without love? Would our children do better with or without us exhibiting this \"love\" behavior towards them. \n \n \n \nThis sort of stuff was dealt with hundreds of years ago...\n \"It is not perhaps without good reason that we attribute to simple-mindedness a readiness to believe anything and to ignorance the readiness to be convinced, for I think I was once taught that a belief is like an impression stamped on our soul: the softer and less resisting the soul, the easier it is to print anything on it...On the other hand there is a silly arrogance in continuing to disdain something and to condemn it as false just because it seems unlikely to us. That is a common vice among those who think their capacities are above the ordinary\". \n \"That it is madness to judge the true and the false from our own capacities\", Michel de Montaigne (1993), \"The Essays: A Selection\", Penguin Classics, p74. \n and\n\n \n I think most would agree here, but careful, again you state my claims:\n #1 Believing in anything without having a rigorous criteria for belief can result in you beliving in things which rationally you should not believe in. Naivity and ignorance can result. I have stated my rigorous criteria.\n #2 Understanding even the simplest forms of say, integration in calculus, are WAY beyond my normal life. The answers are less out of the ordinary, but the methods are to some degree, extraordinarly abstract. Thus, we should approach learning humbly, and not pre-judge based on our limited understanding (and still of course use those rigorous criteria).\n \n \n \n\"When we read in Bouchet about miracles associated with the relics of Saint Hilary we can shrug it off: His right to be believed is not great enough to take away our freedom to challenge him. But to go on from there and condemn all similar accounts seems to me to be impudent in the extreme. Such a great saint as Augustine swears that he saw: a blind child restored to sight by the relics of Saint Gervaise and Saint Protasius at Milan; a woman in Carthage cured of a cancer by the sign of the cross made by a woman who had just been baptised; his close friend Hesperius driving off devils (who were infesting his house) by using a little soil taken from the sepulchre of our Lord, and that same soil, borne into the Church, suddenly curing a paralytic; a woman who, having touched the reliquary of Saint Stephen with a posy of flowers during a procession, rubbed her eyes with them afterwards and recovered her sight which she had recently lost... What are we to accuse him of - hum and the two holy bishops, Aurelius and Maximinus, whom he calls on as witnesses? Is it of ignorance, simple-mindedness, credulity, deliberate deception or imposture? .... 'Qui, ut rationem mullan afferent, ipsa auhtoritate me frangerent (Why, even if they gave no reasons, they would convince me by their very authority) \n Michel de Montaigne in \"That it is madness to judge the true and the false from our own capacities\"\n Sometimes the authority of the witness is enough.\n But tell me, how would you gather dead eye-witnesses? I'm not sure how you'd do that.\n But even in courts today eye-witnesses are accepted as evidence. Sometimes it's the only evidence.\n\n Yes, but sadly we have never experienced these things in our modern day world, nor have we uncovered historical evidence to support these things (books written by those of the religious faith, without evidence, and without them alive, we should not accept). Parsimony points to there being no reason other than human fiction, since it's the simplest answer, and the best fit given what we know of the world, and what we know of human motivations. There has never been, and I suspect never will be, any case of \"supernatural healing\" that can be verified in our lifetime. \n \n Eye-witnesses in the courts are different in a few very important ways.\n #1, they are alive and can give their reasons for belief.\n #2 Depending on their \"reasons\" for belief, we can independantly verify them\n #3 The courts are NOT science. They HAVE to reach a verdict, either way. So they use everything at their disposal, including fallible eye-witnesses.\n #4 the courts assign guilt or innocence, not truth or belief!! They don't presume to know the truth, they just take their best shot at it constrained by time, money, and a specific incident with limited evidence and 0 repeatability.\n \n Big difference between the two I think you'll agree. Possibly you heard of the OJ Simpson fiasco in the states. I think most people think he's a murderer, yet the courts assigned innocence. It's a \"good\" system, but it's nowhere near rigorous enough for a civilization's building of knowledge.\n \n \nWhere dot they exist in the physical world?\n\n Energy and matter with a time component.\n \n \nAh-ha! We have a break-through. So, if a given number of people believe it, then even without science, it is real. So 'evidence' as brought about through means of your version of science (your philosophy of science) is not always needed.\n\n I think we have covered this above, if not, let me know.\n \n \nDo you know of people who were deemed 'dead' and then 'returned'?\n\n Sure, many primitive cultures propose this. However, we know of no way this is possible, and no one we have every witnessed in modern history has ever returned. No one comes back from death unfortunately. So why believe it? Rigorous...isn't met.\n \n \nI believe God exists in the physical world. In the same sense that people might see a ghost that leaves 'no trace' other than upon their own experience. Likewise love can exist in the physical world, emanating from God (who is love). But you make a mistake in your logic. I am not the one who is arguing that I only believe that which science can test. If science can't test love, wherever it is, doesn't affect my belief in it.\n It is in fact the Orthodox mind-set. We are a ?mysterious? church in that we don?t come up with formula about God ? though we do have certain ideas ? we don?t expect to say ?this is all that God is? because God by His very nature will never be known fully to us. So, you need be mindful in applying your ?rules? for what are accepted to me, in so far as demanding me to define things. It is not I who rests my knowledge on the confines of science, but you.\n \n But there simply isn't any reason why something like this is needed to explain anything. Nor is there a reason to assume it's existence in the first place. If we do start seeing supernatural phenomenon that can be verified, and we can find NO explanation for \"apples appearing out of thin air around some holy site\", then our notion of what's \"ordinary\" expands, and we have room for dieties most probably. However, that's not the case. \n \n \nThere is a theory that when people dealt with 'gods' in ages past, that these were nothing but aliens, who would appear 'god like' to some. Fairies need not be super-natural. Why not give scientists millions of dollars to speculate that they are in deed material beings?\n\n That's a valid theory. That historical diety references could have just been other superior lifeforms. However, it's not widely accepted because it's more complex and convoluted than the other better fit explanations such as \"the process of evolution\", which works fine on it's own, answers so far every question we have been able to push through it, and needs no other out of the ordinary occurences to do this. Then you have a hundred unanswered questions surrounding it. Why? Why did they leave? Why did they come in the first place? Why don't they contact us again? etc., etc. Very messy.\n \n \nAnd where have scientists attempted to describe it mathematically?\n\n When we get there, we will be able, with the right hardware, to make artificial intelligence. I think we have a long way to go on the application side for that :/\n \n \nThat's one thing. It's another to debate about the great quest for knowledge of scientists engaged in speculation about aliens. But my objections are also fuelled by the philosophy that money should be spent on what we do know now; such as problems with diseases - research for - that needs money\n\n That, you wouldn't get much of a debate from me about. Although since we're taking opposing sides, I'll say again that I think the proportion we spend on this vs other more applicable science is very, very insignificant. And diversity is always good...keep the extreme \"out there\" sciences funded, but barely. At least in the US, they actually plan the top 5 or so areas to dump huge amounts of federal funding each year. Aids, cancer, genetics, are among the top3. Note: They are all based on science!! Hooray, science isn't the root of all evil ;)\n \n \nI do feel that your definition flies in the face of the posts I cited which quite happily put these pursuits under 'science'.\n\n It's theoretical science. They are actually applying what we know (recall that rigorous belief system reference to this as well), and extrapolating using basically just different variables. An interesting exercise. What we find with diversity is that since (it all ties together) diversity presumes some aren't in the \"mainstream\", they can often offer insight into problems that the mainstream cannot solve, or offer hints to a problem we've never seen. We can't predict where the next solution will come from, I see the merits of it.\n \n Now would I spend time doing this? No, I might watch a 1 hour special on it but devote time every day to it? No way, like you I think there are other contributions which I can make to society that have a greater impact :) \n \n \n \nWe Orthodox have Holy Tradition, and follow Apostolic Succession. My bishop can trace his position's lineage back to St.Peter, who founded our church at Antioch. (this would enable you to guess that I'm Antiochian Orthodox). We have the writings of St.Peter's students, such as St. Clement of Rome (apostolic ancestor to the bishops of Rome), and St. Ignatius of Antioch.\n I expect though you'd accept nothing more than a sworn affidavit by every single one of them. :) But even that would not be 'testable' in a lab.\n\n I think they can do some lineage testing based on DNA similarity, not sure though, have to read on it. They'd probably have to have fossilized remains though. I'm pretty comfortable with the belief that people reproduce, so I'm entirely opposed to the belief that person X can be related to some person Y in history. However, I can also think of a lot of motivations for lying about something like that...especially when it's your coin that goes towards his new house...\n \n -Mach",

   "I ask for clarification on a point. It's only taken several days to get around to this. But I go into this more below... if I can ask for your indulgence.\n Cool. Gelick in \"Chaos\" talks about the immeasurable surface area of a table.\n So, do you believe that the immeasurable aspects of it don't exist? I ask because you suggest that evidence (in the forms of science proof) is what you accept as something exists. Given that height has two natures (analogous to man having spiritual as well as physical natures), you seem to accept both, even though one is evidenced.\n It is good to draw an inference of one, from the knowledge of the other. \n\n \nThat link I posted was long, but the gist of it was sufficient evidence, know your source, and believing things which go beyond our experience is rational only when it is inferred from that experience by the assumption that what we do not know, is like what we know.\n In your case that's the test it fails. Supernatural is not like \"What we know\". It's outside of our knowledge, there is nothing, anywhere, to indicate something exists outside the physical world (Parsimony too applies here), so there is no reason, without either of the other two criteria fulfilled, to believe in it.\n\n Firstly, you can't believe in 'the supernatural full-stop! Because by definition it lies outside naturalistic/materialistic science. So how could I prove to you the super-natural might exist? I can't possibly because it would never fit the constraints of the rules by which you admit evidence.\n So you're saying that I can't fit a test because the constraints of the test wouldn't allow for what you're asking me to show by that test. That is why it is circular reasoning.\n \npassing time, humming music as Montalban reads site\n Okay...\n I find this most amusing. I ask for scientific proof on the measurability of love, and you present a philosophical debate.\n Where is the science? \n\n \nI think we're not communicating on \"science\". Science is a method, a process. We have some math formulas and such for the theory of special relativity, but we call it a theory. Much of science is theory, but it's based on the scientific process. Big difference. It can be argued, although I have no use for the argument, that nothing can be \"known\", for we cannot even define \"known\", therefore there is no such thing as \"proof\", etc. Everything then becomes a moot point. I think to have meaningful debate, we have to accept the premise that some things \"can be known\". Otherwise, it's again, like telling a doctor she cannot work on a patient because she doesn't KNOW the cure will work and wont' kill the patient. She most certainly DOESN'T know this, but with science, you at least have a foundation to both work from, and to build upon.\n\n No your test is not what 'can be known' but 'what can be known by science' (the crux of this debate is whether they're the same thing). So when I ask you how do you know 'love' exists, by science you give me non-science and the idea that one day it might be known by science. You then go on about 'proof' etc. You've not even offered a 'proof' within the realm of science, but philosophy. I understand the idea that ultimately nothing can really be proven by science, and that science rests on tests, evidence etc.\n Where is the test for love?\n The evidence? Well you offered personal observation of something that is un-testable scientifically. That is what I present with regards to God's walking on water. Your belief in one and rejection of the other don't seem to be based on science.\n [quote=Montalban]No, this is still one of your goal shifts. Any definition I bring forward about God is love will fall on the sword of your artificial constraints for evidence -that there is no God.\n In effect I would have to provide a scientific definition of love, based on tests - which don't exist - because science doesn't/hasn't tested for love - even when you cite 'evidence' for love as found by science you present general consensus of people's experiences, and a philosophical debate. \n \nNo, its not just a general consensus, it's a combination of things.\n #1 I experience it. I can read any number of sources from history through present that also seem to \"share\" my experience just as I describe it myself.\n\n I experience God\n \n#2 I can ask any number of capable individuals if they also experience such things and they can confirm or deny it. \n\n Other people experience God\n \n#3 I cannot imagine a \"good\" reason why anyone would lie about experiencing \"ideas\", on average.\n\n I can't imagine how 'good' itself can exist without Him\n \n#4 Ideas seem to form part of our consciousness, throughout the world there is evidence of manipulation by humans which would require, in some definition, the formation of ideas.\n\n Yes, there are churches that manipulate\n \n#5 we can define love as a set of physical and/or behavioural Reponses. I.e. increased heartbeat, flush skin, endorphin release, subject A will, while in this \"love\" state (can be a short time or long time eh?) will listen the other persons problems, talk fondly of them when they aren't around, etc. We can than run around and test this. Perfect? Of course not, again, in the end, nothing can be \"known\". Sufficient? Of course.\n\n related to #1 that when I experience God, I react to God. Hopefully with love.\n Look, I accept love based on the ideas you present - and so I don't argue against 'love'. HOWEVER none of what you give is science. You came close with reactions to 'love', but a reaction to what might be love is not a proof that love exists, just a belief that whatever is there causes a particular reaction.\n BUT if I tell you I feel God's love, but you would reject that as self-deceit based on your idea that there is no God, there-by negating the 'reaction' 'test'. It falls back to above where I provided a parallel with God walking on water. You would accept one thing and not the other, not based on science.\n \nThat's a robust list! And yes, it can be termed \"scientific\", because it follows certain methods and testability criteria, etc. You CAN examine religion using science, but it always turns up the same answer..does not compute. I.e. there is no evidence, and it's like nothing that we currently \"know\", so there is not reason to believe.\n\n No, it only turns up that answer if you apply your 'filter'. That's just logic. If I apply different parameters I'd get different results. I apply different parameters - they accomadate God.\n \n Here's your best argument? That one day science might find an answer. Given that it hasn't now, and you believe that science is the arbiter of what 'is', then love 'is not' for the present.\n The difference between 'love' and 'height' is that we have some tests for 'height', some aspect is measurable. I don't know of any for 'love'. \n\n \nSimilar to the above explanations of how science is not a final stake in the ground that says \"without a doubt, this is TRUE\". It's open to correction from anyone, at anytime, as long as it's based on reason and the criteria for science.\n\n Yes, I've covered that. You've not shown anything that even remotely comes close to a 'proof' as in the confines of science (as you see science).\n \nIf you believe love exists 'in the physical world' show me the tests for it.\n I would like to see any test at all that you have, for any definition. If you believe that love is but a matter of chemicals, then I'd be interested to hear this too. But I think there's a difference between stimuli and stimulus here. I can, in my weaker moments, see a beautiful woman on the street, and be aroused. You can measure the physical aspects, but it still doesn't explain why I'm aroused by this particular woman, and not another; not just her appearance, but other non-materialistic factors are at work. I would expect otherwise one could come up with a scientific rule of thumb over which woman I would love - a prediction based on a scientific hypothesis.\n\n \n Why do you think that last line? The problem here is that you don't accept that it's OK to not know the answer to everything.This is what many in philosophy call \"humility\". Science cannot touch a lot of things.\n\n My church is deemed a 'mysterious' faith because we understand the limits of knowledge. When we know God, ultimately the test is noetic - that is, through the heart.\n \n We can't even adequately describe everything about gravity, yet we witness it's affects every day. It's like a cone of knowledge, standing on the base like a tepee. The parts that we can uncover with our meagre human intelligence and science starts at the little bitty tip at the top, and we work our way down, slowly. There may even be a limit to how much we can \"know\". But suffice to say we work from the beginning, and make forward progress.\n\n I understand this, but the analogy between 'love' and gravity falls apart because you at least can test some aspects of gravity. You haven't shown any test for 'love', none at all.\n \nSecondly, you will need to break out of superstitious beliefs, where when we don't understand something, we attribute it to something supernatural. That's a human reaction, but we can think beyond it now that we know a thing or two. Primitives had no idea what lighting was and assumed it was from the gods. Wow the sun is a fiery globe, must BE a god. Well, once we build our knowledge base, we come to realize a better way to describe these things, that indeed fall within the physical world. We've been doing this for a short time relatively speaking (thousands of years), but we've already made huge leaps in understanding and have removed the supernatural from where it did not belong.\n\n Yes and many scientists of the day thought the earth was the centre of the solar system, because at the time it was the best science had to offer. Bringing up 'mistakes' is a two-edged sword. If you want, I'd be happy to delve into another science; Neptunism.\n \nPoint being. There is nothing that indicates that a human behavioural response in particular, what you're describing as love, has any component that points to it being outside the physical world.\n\n This is a truism for your point of view as you can't test for anything outside the physical world, because you've already established the method of testing is only that which is material.\n \nIn fact, we do know some of the components of this \"love\", as I mentioned before. Behaviour...which we can show some behaviours as part of our genetic makeup. Parsimony suggests that indeed, there is no reason it wouldn't also be similar.\n\n What you've done here is re-worded your previous statement regarding common experience. If you want to accept common experience is science, that's fine.\n \nChange in the physical states of the brain. We can and do measure some of these. And that's from the physical side.\n\n Yes, I accept if you kill a person they would cease to love. That is a physical side. What does that prove about love not being any bit super-natural? As I said in a previous post we are both natural and super-natural in one being - we have a mind, and we have a soul.\n \n From the theoretical (math) side, we can also, as Ursus points out, use things like competitive game theory to show a cause for the advantage that a behaviour like love can give a competing population. For example, would you guess our civilization (population) would do better with or without love? Would our children do better with or without us exhibiting this \"love\" behaviour towards them. \n\n This is a difficult point you make. We are here. You believe evolution got us here, so no matter what we are, was brought about through evolution and therefore what we are is successful to survival, because obviously we survived.\n And again, I accept that love exists. I have never denied it. Therefore your point is wasted because I believe God created us to be what we are and that the divine spark of God who is love rests in us and that is why we have love.\n Neither your belief, nor mine, prove that love exists in a scientific sense. We both just state that we are how we are. You saying we got here through evolution, me, through God's creative hand.\n \nThis sort of stuff was dealt with hundreds of years ago...\n \"It is not perhaps without good reason that we attribute to simple-mindedness a readiness to believe anything and to ignorance the readiness to be convinced, for I think I was once taught that a belief is like an impression stamped on our soul: the softer and less resisting the soul, the easier it is to print anything on it...On the other hand there is a silly arrogance in continuing to disdain something and to condemn it as false just because it seems unlikely to us.

Fairies need not be super-natural. Why not give scientists millions of dollars to speculate that they are in deed material beings? \n\n \nThat's a valid theory. That historical deity references could have just been other superior lifeforms. However, it's not widely accepted because it's more complex and convoluted than the other better fit explanations such as \"the process of evolution\", which works fine on it's own, answers so far every question we have been able to push through it, and needs no other out of the ordinary occurrences to do this. Then you have a hundred unanswered questions surrounding it. Why? Why did they leave? Why did they come in the first place? Why don't they contact us again? etc., etc. Very messy.\n\n Cool, then would you support a scientific search for fairies, goblins, trolls, elves, etc?\n \nAnd where have scientists attempted to describe it mathematically? \n\n \nWhen we get there, we will be able, with the right hardware, to make artificial intelligence. I think we have a long way to go on the application side for that\n\n You have great faith\n \nThat's one thing. It's another to debate about the great quest for knowledge of scientists engaged in speculation about aliens. But my objections are also fuelled by the philosophy that money should be spent on what we do know now; such as problems with diseases - research for - that needs money \n\n \nThat, you wouldn't get much of a debate from me about. Although since we're taking opposing sides, I'll say again that I think the proportion we spend on this vs other more applicable science is very, very insignificant. And diversity is always good...keep the extreme \"out there\" sciences funded, but barely. At least in the US, they actually plan the top 5 or so areas to dump huge amounts of federal funding each year. Aids, cancer, genetics, are among the top3. Note: They are all based on science!! Hooray, science isn't the root of all evil \n\n So it wouldn't matter if they spent just a few millions to see if trolls are somewhere 'out there'?\n \nI do feel that your definition flies in the face of the posts I cited which quite happily put these pursuits under 'science'. \n\n \nIt's theoretical science.\n\n Yes I know that.\n \nThey are actually applying what we know (recall that rigorous belief system reference to this as well), and extrapolating using basically just different variables. An interesting exercise.\n\n What do we know about aliens?\n \nWhat we find with diversity is that since (it all ties together) diversity presumes some aren't in the \"mainstream\", they can often offer insight into problems that the mainstream cannot solve, or offer hints to a problem we've never seen. We can't predict where the next solution will come from, I see the merits of it.\n Now would I spend time doing this? No, I might watch a 1 hour special on it but devote time every day to it? No way, like you I think there are other contributions which I can make to society that have a greater impact \n\n What basis of knowledge is the foundation for the speculation of aliens?\n \nWe Orthodox have Holy Tradition, and follow Apostolic Succession. My bishop can trace his position's lineage back to St.Peter, who founded our church at Antioch. (this would enable you to guess that I'm Antiochian Orthodox). We have the writings of St.Peter's students, such as St. Clement of Rome (apostolic ancestor to the bishops of Rome), and St. Ignatius of Antioch.\n I expect though you'd accept nothing more than a sworn affidavit by every single one of them. But even that would not be 'testable' in a lab. \n\n \nI think they can do some lineage testing based on DNA similarity, not sure though, have to read on it. They'd probably have to have fossilized remains though. I'm pretty comfortable with the belief that people reproduce, so I'm entirely opposed to the belief that person X can be related to some person Y in history. However, I can also think of a lot of motivations for lying about something like that...especially when it's your coin that goes towards his new house...\n -Mach\n\n I meant lineage of authority, not lineage of person -actually I did state that! It is akin to your presidents handing the reigns of office from one person to the next without actually being related in a biological sense -which seems to be what you thought I meant when you mention DNA, but you can trace the 'power' back through to Washington. I don't think there's actually a 'science test' for this, but it is just accepted.\n As I stated... Jesus taught St.Peter. St. Peter taught St.Ignatius. St.Ignatius taught etc... down to my current bishop. The lineage can be traced.\n \n PS I respect your right to reply to all that I have posted here, but because of the growing length of this debate I will probably restrict my response to your response to just that dealing directly with aliens and the pursuit of science (for them). I state this NOW because too many times when I've not replied people take this as an admission of defeat. In the past I've explained AFTER I've withdrawn and people still want to point score with claims of 'victory'",

They have the longest wavelengths in the EM range, thus, are quite a logical choice for sending messages through outerspace. It's also all they have funding to do, they would most certainly LOVE to communicate in a myriad of ways to outer space, but they simply don't have a huge budget to do so. \n \n \nYes, but you confidentially claim trolls don't exist. Based on what? Faith!\n PS, are you now through referring to it as science-fiction. That got me laughing.\n\n \n Where do I claim trolls don't exist? Please quote me.\n What is a troll anyway and how would I know they don't exist when I don't even know what a troll is?\n \n I'm glad your education can be a fun experience.

Big difference (to someone seeking to be correct, that is).\n\n Is there a point in that?\n \nyou're happy with scientists looking for them, based on the fact that they might well exist even though there's no evidence for it (circular reasoning 1.02). \n\n \nAh, no, you aren't as good at identifying circular reasoning as I am Montalban. Or you choose to do so incorrectly just to get me arguing more.\n\n I've been quite explicit in debunking your reasoning.\n Two things:\n trolls\n aliens\n legends are the only thing that supports both. You accept one as 'real' and the other as not 'real'. For what reason? That you accept one as 'real' and the other as not 'real'. Therefore it's noble for scientists to look for the one that's real, and not the one that's not real - because one is real, the other isn't. Round and round we go.\n \nScientists do not claim it's true, based on no evidence. They have a theory, supported by evidence, and they look for evidence. If the evidence supports the theory, OK, if not, OK. Either way it advances the science (body of knowledge). They, unlike you, do not start with the premise that something exists. They are looking for evidence of SOMETHING that might exist. So, no circular reasoning in there, sorry to disappoint you.\n\n You're attempting to miss the point.\n Scientists don't know trolls don't exist. You state categorically that they don't. You have a belief that they don't, based on your belief that they don't.\n \nHowls of laughter can be heard to cross the international date line \n\n \n And to think you laughed and were incorrect on both points\n how embarassing. (sic)\n -Mach\n\n You've still been short in the evidence stakes to support your beliefs. You simply continue to re-state your own beliefs.\n \n Let's look at a work of scientists (albeit an older one)\n \"This is a case from a document published in 1842 - that is 130 years ago when there was no discussion about CETI. That, of course, makes it all the more reliable. This is a report of a monastery clerk in Northern Russia addressed to a high dignitary of the Russian Church who reports that on August 15, 1663, there was a visitation of the earth between 10 and 12 hours from the clear skies. A sphere appeared, about 40 meters in diameter; from the lower part two rays extended earthward and smoke poured from the sides of the vehicle.\"\n Sagan, C, (Ed.), (1973) \"Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence: CETI\", MIT Press, p186.\n There is no 'actual evidence' in the sense that you debate me, when I mention witness accounts of the Apostles; and in this case they accept the witnesses of Orthodox clergy. (Why don't you debunk this as 'irrational'? Because it's done by scientists!)\n They also recognise the point I made re: legends...\n \"So, the human imagination, you see, is so constructed that people build up certain details as Leonardo da Vinci did in drawing a flying dragon. Man uses his imagination very broadly, but all the products of the human imagination are based on realities. It is our duty to find details that could not have been invented but which refer to realities\" (Ibid, p187.)\n So again, your own beliefs are 'your belief's and contrary to this group of eminent scientists, including Nobel winner Dr Francis Crick.\n However, they then go on to talk about what kind of societies the aliens might have...\n \"At this point, I think it is necessary for us to introduce or to clarify a distinction between primary-evolved civilizations and diffused civilizations....in the future evolution of our contacts, we should think about the sociology of CETI and by this I mean the social structure of the communication between technical civilizations. We have emphasized the energy aspects of Type II and Type III civilizations...\" (Ibid, pp170-171)",

   " as scientists go by even less evidence in their search for aliens.  \n \n \n Shown false by my statement, and your acceptance, that there are also legends of UFOs. Please do try to not rub your own nose in your mistakes.\n \n ----------------------------------------------\n \n What is a troll? List reasons why it would be OK to search for them, I have listed reasons for life on other planets, can you not support your position?\n \n Why \"looking for\" possible life on other worlds is reasonable:- Scientists estimates around 100 BILLION planets might be suitable for life as we know it, that's about 2 per solar system that has planets.\n 1. We have have only visited 2 out of the 100 Billion planets suitable for life\n and 1 of them is teeming with life.\n 2. There is nothing in the physical universe that suggests life on other planets is not possible\n 3. Parsimony suggests that if 1 of two planets we have investigated (suitable for life) is filled with living things, some of the other 100 billion may indeed have \"life\".\n 4. there are legends of UFO sightings and alien abductions. ( I would not accept this evidence, but Montalban wants to and thinks it's important for guiding what we spend money on)\n -----------------------------------------\n \n 1.

   "Mach, show me a citation supporting your opinion.\n \n So far you've re-worked the whole concept of SETI to 'science fiction', what a gaff that was; especially as you're the one defending them.\n \n Secondly I stated that myths are based (often) on truths. You denied this, when I suggest that 'the gods' could have been aliens. Yet you were happy for scientists to look for aliens, just not in any historical context.\n \n Next out of the blue you switch around to evidencing from mythology. But when I cite a case of a Russian monk who sited (alleged) UFOs you're jumped again to a new novel position.\n \n At the end of the day, your 'evidence-lite' threads, whilst entertaining in a light-hearted way do you no credit when any reader tries to ascertain why you arbitrarily rule one scientific endeavour worthy, and another not.\n \n Like you other posts I predict you'll simply go for the re-statement of your circular reasoning again... without reference to any actual citations.",

   "Appeal to Authority\n (argumentum ad verecundiam)\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Definition: \n While sometimes it may be appropriate to cite an authority to\n support a point, often it is not. In particular, an appeal to\n authority is inappropriate if:\n (i) the person is not qualified to have an expert\n opinion on the subject,\n (ii) experts in the field disagree on this issue.\n (iii) the authority was making a joke, drunk, or\n otherwise not being serious\n A variation of the fallacious appeal to authority is hearsay. An\n argument from hearsay is an argument which depends on\n second or third hand sources. \n \n \n Examples: \n (i) Noted psychologist Dr. Frasier Crane recommends that\n you buy the EZ-Rest Hot Tub.\n (ii) Economist John Kenneth Galbraith argues that a tight\n money policy s the best cure for a recession. (Although\n Galbraith is an expert, not all economists agree on this\n point.)\n (iii) We are headed for nuclear war. Last week Ronald\n Reagan remarked that we begin bombing Russia in five\n minutes. (Of course, he said it as a joke during a\n microphone test.)\n (iv) My friend heard on the news the other day that Canada\n will declare war on Serbia. (This is a case of hearsay; in\n fact, the reporter said that Canada would not declare war.)\n (v) The Ottawa Citizen reported that sales were up 5.9\n percent this year. (This is hearsay; we are not n a position to\n check the Citizen's sources.)\n \n Why the need to reference what is common sense?\n \n Waxy",
