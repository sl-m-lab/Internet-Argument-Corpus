I hope your feeling about not caring about yourself or anyone else is very temporary. If it doesnt go away, seek counsel, you may be having what is called mood swings, the signs of a oncoming depressive disorder.. Not a doctor here, just been around awhile. jmo good luck to you",

   " Life is inherently valuable.\n\n This is what you believe. But life is only valuable to you because you place value upon it. It is completely subjective and depends upon the perspective from which you are viewing the world. The way you see the world is the way you see the world... and I'm not suggesting you are wrong for seeing the world that way. I'm only pointing out that your way is not the only way... and you can argue that your way is the 'right' way, but who presently on earth can determine what is the ONE 'right' way -- if such a concept even exists.\n \n All life is inherently valuable? Or just human life? All human life? Or just human life after it has become viable in a mother's womb? Plant life? Bacteria? And valuable to what extent? To the point that one should not kill any other life? Or to the point that when one takes the life of another living organism, one does so purely for sport and lets the remains go to waste? Valuable to the point that it's okay to take the life of a few if it means that many more will survive?\n \n \nTo remove oneseslf from the emotional component is a denial of reality.\n\n What is reality? Is reality the stories you create in your mind through the lens with which you view the world? Emotion in this context simply blurs reality.\n \n What I am suggesting is not the idea of removing oneself from experiencing emotion... but rather recognizing that you (the intangible you that is beyond the sum of the physical mass that comprises your body) are not inherently linked to the emotions that the physical body may be feeling. It is possible to allow the physical you to experience many emotions without BEING those emotions... without allowing yourself to become emotionally attached.\n \n Have you ever gotten into a discussion or argument with somebody that became a little heated? Most likely the topic was one that you have much invested in... something that you feel strongly about. You may have felt that the other person was personally attacking you or your beliefs, and you may have felt frustrated because you felt they were not comprehending even the most simple point of what you were attempting to communicate. You may have gotten red in the face, and felt your blood pressure rising. You may have felt what you would describe as anger. \n \n I am simply suggesting that anyone (who desires to) is capable of removing themselves from the emotional attachment they feel in such situations. With practice, it's really quite easy. It could be described as a \"very Zen-like thing.\"",

   "I agree with the original poster in terms of life. We live, we die, it goes on. So if I die well, it would have happened anyway. But I find it hard to not have emotions. And that's because I do have emotions about the way I'm living. I have a lot of friends and would be sad if they left. I kind of like my life so if I have a choice I would rather live than die. I'm not sure but I haven't heard a single religion that believes in baseball after death, so I'd rather play as much as I can before I die. I care about my life, but I agree that death is part of life. I know I will die and whether I worry about it or not it will happen. I think it's sort of like when a teacher is going to give back a test we have already taken and everyone's so nervous. I just say my score won't change if I worry, if I did bad I did bad and I'm not going to worry about it. I still care about it, but I don't go worrying about it. I'm not sure if that's what the original poster meant or whether they really don't care. I think if you are really studying and staying in shape for a job you want to do then you do care. I see a lot of people in school who don't care, and you don't seem to be like that. these are people who cut class, pick fights, and do whatever feels good at the moment. They are the people who care once they have to work at McDonalds because they didn't care. And that's just not caring about an education. Actually speaking of an education it's kind of weird. Last year I tried really hard to get good grades and stuff and got 5 A's and 3 B's. This year I seriously didn't care what grade I got, I just wanted to learn the stuff and I got straight A's. Moral of the story: If you don't care about something, you'll do better at it? If so, continue not to care, you will go far :). Sorry if I rambled a bit too long, but now I'm done.",
