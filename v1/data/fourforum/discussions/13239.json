Those unable to work would be provided for by the religious community. People like Romney, McCain, Palin, Thompson would be the leaders. There would be a strong military, just like the constitution prescribes. \n \n In the west, they wouldn't need state governments - everything would be decided by a massive federal government. Jeremiah Wright, Barney Frank, Nancy Pelosi, Obama, Biden, the list of impressive leaders would be long. They could administer free health care for everyone, design smart pedal-cars for everyone, and pretty well tell everyone just how they'll live and what they'll do. They could save lots of money by having little or no military, they could beg the east to help them out with aggressive enemies whenever necessary.

   "What a load. Californication is extremistville, especially those radical, godless zombies up in the Bay area. And that goes for Vermont and large areas of the East Coast, along with the fruitcakes up in Minnesota, who would put Bugs Bunny in office if he'd just hop on the ballot.\n \n I think we all know what would happen if we put all the liberals in California. It'd be bankrupt in 6 months, and it would only take a batallion of basic training types to overrun it, assuming someone would be interested in subjegating 30 million village imbeciles.\n\n \n \n \n Typical thinking of your average right wing christian nut. To even think of considering secession from the Union is not only treason, but a clear slap in the face to those who died on both sides of the Civil War which was this nation's costliest war in lives..\n \n Funny but when these crazies wave their American flags and don't get what they want, they then turn to secession. And what would you do once the country was divided? Enslave blacks? Have massive firing squads lining up homosexuals by the hundreds who did not obey your \"morality\" laws?\n \n It is clear the thinking your side portrays is dangerous and horrifying. If this is the true face of the Republican party and the GOP I sure am glad your party has no majority whatsoever in any branch of government.\n \n Oh how the south will rise again........",
