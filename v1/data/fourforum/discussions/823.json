   "The Doctrine Of the Nicolaitanes\n \n \n \n \n Revelation 2:15, \"So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.\"\n \n \n You will recall that I brought out in the Ephesian Age that the word, Nicolaitane, comes form two Greek words: Nikao which means to\" conquer, and lao which means the laity. Nicolaitane means, \" to conquer the laity.\" Now why is this such a terrible thing. It is terrible because God has never placed His church in the hands of an elected leadership which moves with political mindedness. He has placed His church in the care of God-ordained, Spirit-filled, Word-living men who lead the people through feeding them the Word. He has not separated the people into classes so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood. It is true that the leadership must be holy, but then so must be the whole congregation. Further, there is no place in the Word where priests or ministers or such mediate between God and the people, nor is there a place where they are separated in their worship of the Lord. God wants all to love and serve Him together. Nicolaitanism destroys those precepts and instead separated the ministers from the people and makes the leaders overlords instead of servants. Now this doctrine actually started as a deed in the first age. It appears that the problem lay in two words:\"elders\"(presbyters)and \"overseers\"(bishops). Though Scripture shows that there are several elders in each church, some began (Ignatius among them) to teach that the idea of a bishop was one of preeminence or authority and control over the elders. Now the truth of the matter is the word \"elder\" signifies who the person is , while the word \"bishop\" signifies the office of the same man. The elder is the man. Bishop is the office of the man, \"Elder\" always has and always will refer simply to a man's chronological age in the Lord. He is an elder, not because he is elected or ordained, etc, but because he is OLDER. He is more seasoned, trained, not a novice, reliable because of experience and long standing proof of his Christian experience. But no, the bishops did not stick to the epistles of Paul, but rather they went to Paul's account of he time he called the elders from Ephesus to Miletus In Acts 20. In verse 17 the record states, \"elders\" were called and then in verse 28 they are called overseers(bishops). And these bishops, (no doubt political minded and anxious for power) insisted that Paul had given the meaning that \"overseers\" were more than the local elder with official capacity only in his own church. To them a bishop was now one with extended authority over many local leaders. Such a concept  was neither Scriptural nor historical, yet even a man of the stature of Polycarp leaned toward such organization. Thus, that which started as a deed in the first age was made a literal doctrine and so it is today. Bishops still claim power to control men and deal with them as they desire, placing them where they so will in the ministry. This denies the leadership of the Holy Ghost Who said, \"Separate Me Paul and Barnabas for the work whereunto I have called them. This is anti -Word and Antichrist. Matthew 20:25-28, \"But Jesus called them unto Him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you; but whosoever will be great among you , let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you; let him be your servant: Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.\" Matthew 23:8-9,\n \n Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon the earth: for One is your Father, Which is in heaven.\"\n \n \n \n \n In order to clarify this even more, let me explain Nicolaitanism in this way, You recall that in Revelation 13:3 it says, \"And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death: and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.\" Now we know that the wounded head was the pagan Roman Empire, that great political world power. This head rose again as the \"Roman Catholic Spiritual empire.\" Now watch this carefully . What did political pagan Rome do that was the basis of her success? She, \"divided and conquered.\" That was the seed of Rome-divide and conquer. Her iron teeth tore and devoured. Whom she tore and devoured could not rise again as when she destroyed Carthage and sowed her to salt. The same iron seed remained the same- divide and conquer. That is Nicolaitanism and God hates it.\n \n \n \n \n Now it is a well known historical fact that when this error crept into the church, men began to vie for the office of bishop with the result that this position was being given to the more educated and materially -progressive and politically minded men. Human knowledge and program began to take over divine wisdom place and the holy spirit no longer controlled. This was indeed a tragic evil, for the bishops began to maintain that it no longer required a [color=red}transparent[/Color] Christian character to minister either the Word or the rites in the church for it was the elements and the ceremony that counted. This allowed evil men(seducers) to rend the flock.\n \n \n \n \n \n With the man-made doctrine of the elevation of bishops to a place not accorded them in Scripture, the next step was the handing out of graded titles that built up into a religious hierarchy; for soon there were arch bishop over bishops and cardinals over the arch bishops and by the time of Boniface the third there was a pope over all, a Pontiff.\n \n \n \n \n \n What with the Nicolaitane doctrine and the amalgamation of Christianity with Babylonianism the net results had to be what Ezekiel saw in Chapter 8:10, \" So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beast, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall around .\"Revelation 18:2, \"And he cried mightily, with a strong voice saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and cage of every unclean and hateful bird, for all nations have drunk of the wind of the wrath of her fornication's\n \n \n \n Now this Nicolaitane doctrine, this rule that was established in the church did not hit it off too well with a lot of people for they could read the odd epistle or essay on the Word written by some godly person. So what did the church do ? It excommunicated the righteous teachers and burned the scrolls .They said, \"It takes a special education to read and understand the Word. Why even Peter said that many things Paul wrote were hard to understand.\" Having taken away the Word from the People , it soon came to the people listening only to what the priest had to say, and doing what he told them, They called that God and his holy Word. They took over the minds and lives of the people and made them the servants of a despotic priesthood.\n \n \n Now if you want proof that the Catholic Church demands the lives and minds of men, just listen to the edict of Theodosius X. Theodosius' First Edict.\n \n \n \n This edict was issued immediately after he was baptized by the First Church of Rome. ' We three emperor will that our subjects steadfastly adhere to the religion which was taught by Saint Peter the Romans, which had been faithfully preserved by tradition and which ins now professed by the pontiff, Damascus of Rome, and Peter, bishop of Alexandria, a man of Apostolic holiness according to the institution of the Apostles, and the doctrine of the Gospel; let us believe in one God head of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, of equal majesty in the Holy Trinity . We order that the adherents of this faith be called Catholic Christians, we brand all the senseless followers of the other religions with the infamous name of heretics, and forbid their conventicles assuming the name of churches. Besides the condemnation of divine justice, they must expect the heavy penalty which our authority, guided by heavenly wisdom shall think proper to inflict.......\"\n \n \n The fifteen penal laws that this emperor issued in as many years deprived the evangelicals of all rights to the exercise of their religion, excluded them from all civil offices, and threated them with fines, confiscation, banishment, and even in some cases, death.\n \n \n Do you know what? We are headed right that way today.",

   "The Roman Catholic Church calls herself the Mother church. She calls herself the first or original church. That is absolutely correct. She was the original First Church of Rome that backslid and went into sin. She was the first that organized. In her was found the deeds and then the doctrine of Nicolaitanism. No one will deny that she is a mother. She is a mother and has produced daughters. Now a daughter comes out of a woman. A woman robed in scarlet is sitting on the seven hills of Rome. She is a harlot and has borne daughters. Those daughters are the Protestant churches that came out of her and then went right back into organization and Nicolaitanism, This Mother of the daughter churches is called a whore. That is a woman who was untrue to her marriage vows. She was married to God and then went off fornicating with the devil and in her fornication's she has brought forth daughters that are just like her . This mother and daughter combination in anti-Word, anti-Spirit and consequently Antichrist. Yes, ANTICHRIST.\n \n Now before I get too far along I want to mention that these early bishops thought that they were above the Word. They told people they could forgive their sins upon confession of those sins. That never was the truth. They began to baptize infants in the second century. They actually practiced regeneration baptism. No wonder people are mixed up today. If they were so mixed up then, so close to Pentecost, now they are in a most desperatecondition, being about two thousand years away from original truth\n \n Oh Church of God , there is only one hope. Get back to the Word and stay with it.\n \n Excerpt By Wiliam Marrion Branham",

   "Rapture,\n I still do not understand what you are saying about Mary.\n \n As for the other things you are asserting, there are many errors present in your scriptural interpretation, your history, and your logic. (Or the presentation of whomever you quoted). Let me start by showing you the errors of your writing by using the Word itself. Then I will show you with history the lie that the original Church of Christ, the Catholic Church apostatized. Finally, I will show you how early Christians could not depend on the Word alone as you propose that we must do as Christians.\n \n \n\"He has not separated the people into classes so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood... Further, there is no place in the Word where priests or ministers or such mediate between God and the people, nor is there a place where they are separated in their worship of the Lord.\" \n \n \n Look to the Word in 2 Corinthians 5:18-20, \"All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry  of reconciliation; that is, God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. So we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us.\" Romans 15:15-16, \"But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder, because of the grace given me by God because of the grace given me by God to be a minister of Christ Jesus  to the Gentiles in the priestly service  of the gospel of God...\" Read 1 Timothy 3:1 to see the qualifications for a bishop (which was more like a priest back then) but definitely distinct from the laity.\n \n \n\"It appears that the problem lay in two words:\"elders\"(presbyters)and \"overseers\"(bishops). Though Scripture shows that there are several elders in each church, some began (Ignatius among them) to teach that the idea of a bishop was one of preeminence or authority and control over the elders. Now the truth of the matter is the word \"elder\" signifies who the person is , while the word \"bishop\" signifies the office of the same man. The elder is the man. Bishop is the office of the man, \"Elder\" always has and always will refer simply to a man's chronological age in the Lord. He is an elder, not because he is elected or ordained, etc, but because he is OLDER. He is more seasoned, trained, not a novice, reliable because of experience and long standing proof of his Christian experience. But no, the bishops did not stick to the epistles of Paul, but rather they went to Paul's account of he time he called the elders from Ephesus to Miletus In Acts 20. In verse 17 the record states, \"elders\" were called and then in verse 28 they are called overseers(bishops). And these bishops, (no doubt political minded and anxious for power) insisted that Paul had given the meaning that \"overseers\" were more than the local elder with official capacity only in his own church. To them a bishop was now one with extended authority over many local leaders. Such a concept was neither Scriptural nor historical, yet even a man of the stature of Polycarp leaned toward such organization. Thus, that which started as a deed in the first age was made a literal doctrine and so it is today.\" \n \n \n A line of authority has always been present in the Church. Consider the fact that God has always left someone in charge of his household from the beginning...Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, the judges, Saul, David, Solomon...Jesus, Peter...This authority is necessary and effective in preventing the sheep from straying from the original gospel that was preached. It can be seen in scripture starting with the primacy of Peter. Now, there are too many verses to list that make this clear as a crystal so I will choose one example (the primacy of Peter could be a thread of its own). Look at Matthew 16:18-19  in which Jesus gives Peter the keys to the kingdom. Compare this verse with Isaiah 22  to see what it means to be entrusted with the keys to the kingdom. You write that \"He is an elder, not because he is elected or ordained, etc, but because he is OLDER.\" I'm not so sure one could be an elder simply by aging. See Acts 14:23  1 Timothy 4:14, 1 Timothy 5:22, and Titus 1:5. One was appointed or ordained by the laying on of hands to be an elder. And you write that \"the bishops did not stick to the epistles of Paul\" but we can see from Paul's writings that he believed in exercising authority in the Church. 1 Thessalonians 5:12, \"But we beseech you, brethren, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord  and admonish you, and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work.\" 2 Thessalonians 3:6, \"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ...\" 2 Thessalonians 3:14, \"If anyone refuses to obey   what we say in this letter, note that man, and have nothing to do with him...\" \n \n \n \n\"Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon the earth: for One is your Father, Which is in heaven.\" \n \n \n I suppose this is directed at the Catholic practice of calling priests father. If we are to take this verse literally then it would be evident in scripture that using the word father as a title of respect for other men would be prohibited. It is exactly the opposite. In truth scripture illustrates that Christ's admonition was to prevent us from violating the commandment of having other gods before the one God. He was trying to prevent us from looking to a human as a father in the way that only God can be our father. Many overlook the following verses though and try to accuse Catholics of not following the faith. There are numerous other verses that use the word father...Luke 16:24, Jesus speaking of the rich man's appeal to Abraham, \"Father Abraham, have mercy upon me...\" Why would Jesus quote this man, calling another \"father\" if he had outlawed this practice? In Acts 7:1-2 Stephen said, \"Brethren and fathers, hear me.\" In Romans 4:1-18, Paul calls Abraham father 7 times. 1 Corinthians 4:14-15  Paul refers to himself as a father, \"For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.\" Ephesians 6:4, \"Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger...\" James 2:21, \"Was not Abraham our father...\" 1 John 2:13, \"I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.\" If this is not enough then look to the 4th commandment, \"Honor your father and mother.\" Hmmm. Why does scripture contain evidence of the apostles calling others in the Church father if it is a practice to be condemned?\n \n \n\"...for soon there were arch bishop over bishops and cardinals over the arch bishops and by the time of Boniface the third there was a pope over all, a Pontiff.\" \n \n \n Well, to say the papacy began with Boniface III is a bit tardy. Boniface III was not pope until the year 607. There were 65 popes before this.",

   "\"Now this Nicolaitane doctrine, this rule that was established in the church did not hit it off too well with a lot of people for they could read the odd epistle or essay on the Word written by some godly person. So what did the church do ? It excommunicated the righteous teachers and burned the scrolls .They said, \"It takes a special education to read and understand the Word. Why even Peter said that many things Paul wrote were hard to understand.\" Having taken away the Word from the People , it soon came to the people listening only to what the priest had to say, and doing what he told them, They called that God and his holy Word...The Roman Catholic Church calls herself the Mother church. She calls herself the first or original church. That is absolutely correct. She was the original First Church of Rome that backslid and went into sin. She was the first that organized.\" \n \n \n The above quote brings up many problematic points. First and foremost, one must consider if Jesus who hand chose the first members of his Church would allow it to fall away so quickly especially since he said that the Counselor would remain with the Church once he was gone. He also said that the gates of hell would not prevail against the Church. Yet the Church went into to apostasy so quickly? Not if Jesus is a man, and a God, of his word.\n \n Next, it must be realized that the Church did not withhold the gospel from anyone. There were not \"a lot of people\" at the time who \"could read the odd epistle\" because there were not \"a lot of people\" at the time who could read at all. The Word was not taken away from the people because the people couldn't read it in the first place so the Word necessarily had to come from the priest. Those who were to read it might have needed a special education but more importantly they needed any inkling of an education at all. Furthermore the Word was not always the written word. Paul tells us this when he writes to the Thessalonians (2:15), to \"hold to the traditions which you were taught by us, either by word of mouth   or by letter.\" This can be further comprehended when one reads the timeline of the bible below.\n \n Another problem lies in the rejection of the Church due to an apostasy in the very early times which it appears that you are asserting. If you reject the Church because of a supposed apostasy very early on then it is logical that you would reject all workings of the Church from that time. If the Church were not following the commands of God then why would one follow any further works by the Church? But if you are even on the fringes of what one calls a Christian then I will guess that you follow many of the doctrines of the supposedly \"apostatized Church\" without even realizing it. You might consider rejecting your Bible, the idea of the Trinity (formally defined in 325 A.D.) and the doctrine that Jesus was true man and true God (formally defined 451). The problem is that the books included in your Bible-every Bible, King James included-were established by the Catholic Church. The Old Testament in the King James has seven less books that were deleted during the Reformation (the apocrypha or deuterocanonicals). The New Testament of King James and Catholic Bibles contain the exact same books. BUT the canon of scripture that we all have today was not definitively established until 397 A.D. at the Council of Carthage. There were scripture writings and these writings were read at worship services but there was not a collected work in the form of the Bible. The Christian Church actually predates the New Testament and the Bible as a whole. \n \n Then one must also consider that the Bible once established was very expensive to obtain because it had to be handwritten. One bible took years to complete, was written on very expensive vellum or parchment, and could cost a year's wages. No one could afford one. And as I mentioned above, most of the world was illiterate anyway. The people did not have access to the Bible until around the mid 1400s when the printing press was invented. So how are all of the masses to live by the \"Word\" and to obtain their salvation through the teachings of the Bible if 1. There was no bible for almost 400 years after Christ 2. There were no copies of the Bible readily available for 1500 years after Christ 3. If Bibles were available the people were illiterate and couldn't read them? There is only one way to learn Christ's teachings and God's word-through the Church! Ephesians 3:10: \"that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places.\" 1 Timothy 3:14-15: \"I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these instructions to you so that, if I am delayed, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and bulwark of truth.\"\n \n \n\"Now before I get too far along I want to mention that these early bishops thought that they were above the Word. They told people they could forgive their sins upon confession of those sins. That never was the truth. They began to baptize infants in the second century. They actually practiced regeneration baptism.\" \n \n \n Once again the Word says otherwise. John 20:22-23, \"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.\" One can forgive me of all sins without me having to confess the sins. All he must do is say, \"I forgive.\" But how is one to retain a sin if he does not know the sin? He must hear my sins, differentiate one from the other, and make a judgment on which to forgive and which to retain. James 5:16, \"Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed.\" \n \n Now I could also give you scriptural evidence for the baptism of infants but I will digress. I fear that I have already gone overboard and over-bored the non-Christians taking part in this debate.",

   "Revelation 2:14, \"Thou hast them that hold the doctrine of Balaam , who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.\n \n \n Now you just can't have a Nicolaitane set-up in the church and not have this other doctrine come in , too.[/I] You see, if you take away the Word of God and the moving of the spirit as a means of worship(\" they that worship me must worship me in truth\") then you will have to give the people another form of worship as a substitute, and substitution spells Balaamism.\n \n \n If we are going to understand what the doctrine of Balaam is in the New Testament church we had better go back and see what if was in the Old Testament church and apply it to that third age and then bring it up to the present.\n \n \n The story is found in Numbers Chapter 22 through 25. Now we know that Israel was the chosen people of God. They were the Pentecostals of their day. They had taken refuge under the blood, they had all been baptized in the Red Sea and they came up out of the waters, singing in the spirit and dancing under the energy of the Holy Ghost, while Miriam, the prophetess, played her tambourine. Well, after a certain time of journeying, these children of Israel came to Moab. You remember who Moab was. He was the son of Lot by one of his own daughters, and Lot in turn was a nephew of Abraham, so Israel and Moab were related. I want you to see that. The Moabites knew the truth, whether they lived up to it or not.\n \n \n So Israel came up to the borders of Moab and sent messengers to the king saying, \" We are brothers. Let us pass through your land. If our people or our animals eat or drink anything, we will gladly pay for it.\" But King Balak got very excited. That head of that Nicolaitane bunch was not about to let the church come through with its signs and wonders and divers manifestations of the Holy Ghost, with their faces shining with the glory of God. It was too risky, as he might lose some of his crowd. So Balak refused to let Israel pass through. In fact, so great was his fear of them, that he went to an hireling prophet called Balaam to mediate between him and God and petition the Almighty to curse Israel, and render them impotent. And Balaam, being eager to take part in political affairs and become a great man , was only too glad to do so. But seeing that he had to approach to, and receive an audience from God to get the people cursed, as he could not do it by himself, he went to ask God if he could have the permission to go. Now isn't that just like the Nicolaitanes we have with us today? They curse everyone that won't go their way\n \n \n \n When Balaam asked God for permission to go,God turned him down, My that stung! But Balak insisted, promising him even greater rewards and honor. So Balaam went back to God. Now one answer from God should have been enough. But not for self-willed Balaam. When God saw his perversity, he told him to get up and go. Quickly he saddled the donkey and away he went. He should have realized that this was simply God's permissive will and he wouldn't be able to curse them if he went twenty times and tried twenty times. How like Balaam are people today! They believe in three Gods, get baptized in three titles instead of the NAME, and yet God will send the Spirit upon them as He did upon Balaam, and they will go on believing that they are exactly right, and here they are actually perfect Balaamites. See, the doctrine of Balaam. Go ahead anyway. Do it your way. They say, \"Well, God has blessed us. It must be aright.\" I know he has blessed you. I don't deny that. But it's the same organizational route that Balaam took. It's defiance to God's word. It's false teaching.\n \n \n So Balaam went wildly down the road until an angel from God stood in his way. But that prophet( bishop, cardinal, chairman, president and general overseer) was so blinded to Spiritual things by the thought of honor and glory and money that he could not see the angel standing with drawn sword. There he stood to block the mad prophet. The little donkey saw him and dodged back and forth until he finally crushed Balaam's foot against a stone wall. The XXX stopped and would not go on. He could not. So Balaam jumped off and began beating him. The donkey then began to talk to Balaam. God let that donkey speak in a tongue. That donkey was no hybrid; he was original seed. He said to the blinded prophet, \" Am I not your donkey, and haven't I carried you faithfully?\" Balaam replied, \"Yes, yes, you are my donkey and you have carried me faithfully until now; and if I can't get going, I'm going to kill you.......whoa! what's this, talking to a donkey? That's funny, I thought I heard the donkey talking and I was answering it back.\"\n \n \n \n God has always spoken in a tongue. He spoke at Belshazzar's feast and then at Pentecost . He is doing it again today. It's a warning of soon coming judgment.\n \n \n Then the angel was made visible to Balaam. He told Balaam that except for the donkey he would be dead even now for tempting God. But when Balaam promised to go back, he was sent on with the admonition to say only what God gave him.\n \n \n \n So Balaam went down and set up seven altars for the clean beasts of sacrifice. He killed a ram signifying the coming of the Messiah. He knew what to do to approach unto God. He had the mechanics just right; but not the dynamics,; same as now. Can't you see it, Nicolaitanes?\n \n \n There was Israel down there in the valley, offering the same sacrifice, doing the same things, but only one had the sighs following. Only one had God in their midst. Form won't get you anywhere, It can't take the place of Spirit-manifestation. That is what happened at Nicaea. They put over Balaam's doctrine, not the doctrine of God. And they stumbled; yea they fell. They became dead men.\n \n \n After the sacrifice was made, Balaam was ready to prophesy. But God tied his tongue up and he could not curse them He blessed them.\n \n \n Balak was very angry, but there was nothing that Balaam could do about the Prophecy. It had been spoken by the Holy Ghost,. So Balak told Balaam to go down, into the valley, and look upon their back parts to see if there wasn't possibly some way he could curse them. The tactics that Balak used are the same tactics they use today. The big denominations look down at the little groups, and anything they find amongst them to make out a scandal they bring it out and shout it. If the moderns live in sin, no one says anything about it; but let one of the elect get into trouble and every paper blasts it across the country. Yes, Israel had her back(carnal) parts. They had their side that wasn't praise-worthy; But in spite of their imperfections, by the purpose of God that works through election, by grace and not by works, THEY HAD THE CLOUD BY DAY AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE BY NIGHT, THEY HAD THE SMITTEN ROCK, THE BRAZEN SERPENT AND THE SIGNS AND WONDERS.\n They were vindicated -not in themselves, but in God.\n \n \n God didn't have any respect for those Nicolaitanes with their PHD's, LLD's and all their fine organizations and the best that man could boast; but He did have respect unto Israel for they had the Word vindicated amongst them. Certainly Israel didn't look too polished up, just having come out of Egypt in precipitous flight , but she was a blessed people anyway. All she had ever known for over three hundred years was herding flocks, tending fields and slaving away in fear of death under the Egyptians. But she was free now. She was a blessed people through the sovereignty of God. Certainly Moab looked down on her. All the other nations did too. Organization always looks down on the unorganized or destroy them when they won't come,\n \n Now someone might ask me, \"Brother Brahman, what makes you think that Moab was organized while Israel was not? Where do you get that idea? \" I get it right here in the Bible. It is all typed out here. Everything written in the Old Testament that is in story form is written for our admonition so that we can learn from it. Here it is right in Numbers 23:9, \"From the top of the rocks I see him, an from the hills I behold him; lo the people shall dwell ALONE and shall NOT BE RECKONED AMONG THE NATIONS.\" There it is. God looking down from the top of the rocks, not in some valley looking for their bad points and condemning them . God seeing them the way He wanted to see them- from the height of love and mercy. They dwelt ALONE and they weren't organized. They didn't have a king. They had a prophet, and the prophet had God in him by the spirit; and the Word came to the prophet and the Word went to the people. They didn't belong to the World Council of Churches, to the Baptists, Presbyterians, Assembly of God or any other group. They were joined to God. They didn't need counsel from and council- they had \"Thus saith the Lord\" in their midst. Hallelujah!\n \n Now in spite of the fact that Balaam knew the proper approach to God and could bring forth a revelation from the Lord by means of a special endowment of power, he was still, for all of that, a bishop in the false group. For what did he do now in order to win favor with Balak? He formulated a plan wherein God would be forced to deal with Israel in death. Just as Satan knew that he could beguile Eve(cause her to fall in fleshly sin) thus causing God to pass His pronounced sentence of death against sin , so Balaam knew that if he could get Israel to sin, God would have to deal with them in death . So he planned a way to get them to come over an join in sin. He sent out invitations to come to the feast of Baal-peor(come over and worship with us). Now Israel, no doubt, had seen the feasts of the Egyptians so they did not feel it was wrong to go and just look on and perhaps eat with the people. (What is wrong with fellowship anyway? We are supposed to love them , aren't we, or how can we win them?)Being friendly never hurt anyone- or so they thought . But when those sexy Moabitish women began to dance and undress while they whirled around doing their rock and roll and twist, the lust rose up in the Israelites and they were drawn in to adultery, and God in wrath slew forty-two thousand of them.\n \n \n And that is what Constantine and his successors did at Nicaea and after Nicaea. They invited the people of God to the convention. And when the church sat down to eat, and rose up to play(partaking of church form, ceremonies, and pagan feasts named after Christian rites) she was trapped; she had committed fornication . And God walked out.\n \n \n \n When any man turns from the Word of God and joins a church instead of receiving the Holy Spirit, that man dies. Dead! That is what he is. Don't join a church. Don't get taken up with Creeds and tradition or anything that takes the place of the Word and the Spirit, or you're dead. It's all over. Your're dead. Eternally separated from God!\n \n \n That is what has happened in every age since. God delivers the people. They come out by the blood, sanctified by the Word, walk through the waters of baptism and get filled with the spirit; but after awhile the first love cools off and someone gets the idea that they ought to organize themselves, and they organize themselves right back in the second generation and sometimes even before then. They no longer have the Spirit of God, just a form of worship. They are dead They have hybridized themselves with creed and form and there is no life in them.\n \n \n So Balaam got Israel to comment fornication Do you know that physical fornication is the very same spirit that lies in organized religion ? I said that the spirit of fornication is the spirit of organization. And all fornicators will have their place in the lake of fire. That is what God thinks of organization, And all fornicators will have their place in the lake of fire. That is what God thinks of organization. Yes sir , the whore and her daughters will be in the lake of fire.\n \n \n \n Denominations are not of God. They never have been and never will be. It's a wrong spirit that separates the people into hierarchy and laity; and it's , therefore, a wrong spirit that separates the people from the people. That's what organization and denominations do. In organizing they separate themselves from the Words of God, and bring themselves into spiritual adultery.\n \n Now notice that Constantine gave special feasts unto the people. They were the old pagan feasts with new names taken from the church, or in some cases christian rites were taken and abused with pagan ceremonies. He took the worship of the sun-god and changed it to the Son of God. Instead of celebrating on December 21, which is when they used to celebrate the feast to the sun-god, they put it up to December 25th and called it the Son of God's birthday. But we know that He was born in April when life comes forth,not in December. And they took the feast to Astarte and called it the Easter celebration wherein the Christian is supposed to celebrate the death and resurrection of the Lord. Actually it was a pagan feast to Astarte. \n \n They placed altars in the church. They put in images. They gave the people what they called the apostles' creed, though you can't find it in the Bible. They taught the people ancestor worship thereby making the Roman Catholic Church the greatest spiritistic church in the world. Every foul bird was in that cage. And you have the Protestants with their organizations doing the same thing.\n \n \n \n They ate things sacrificed to idols. Now I don't say that this really means they were literally eating meats sacrificed to idols. For though the council of Jerusalem has spoken against such, Paul did not make much of it as he said the idols were nothing. It was just a matter of conscience except where it offended another brother and then it was not allowed. Furthermore, this Revelation has to do with Gentiles and not Jews as these are Gentile churches. I see this in the same light I see the words of the Lord, \"Except ye eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you.\n \n \n Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. \" You can see that eating is actually partaking in a spiritual sense So when these people were bowing to the images, lighting candles, using pagan holidays, confessing their sins to men(all of which belongs to the devil's religion.), they were partakers with the devil and not of the Lord. They were in idolatry whether they admitted it or not. They can talk all they want that the altars and the incense are only to remind them of the prayers of the Lord or whatever they think it means; and they can say that when they pray before the image it is just for the sake of emphasis; and that when they confess to the priest, it is really to God they are doing it to in their hearts; and when they say the priest forgives them, it is just that he is doing it in the Name of the Lord; they can say what they want but they are partaking in the well known Babylonian, Satanic religion and have joined themselves to idols and committed spiritual fornication, which means death. They are dead\n \n \n So the church and the state were married, The church joined up with idols. With the power of the state behind them they felt that now, \"The kingdom had come and God's will had been enforced upon the earth. \" No wonder the Roman Catholic Church is not looking for the return of the Lord Jesus. They are not millennialists. They have their millennium right here. The pope is reigning right now and God is reigning in him. So when he comes , according to them , it has to be when the new heavens and earth are prepared. But they are wrong. That pope is the head of the false church, and there is going to be a millennium, but while that is going on he won't be in it. He will be somewhere else.\n \n \n THE WARNING\n \n \n \n Revelation 2:16 , \" Repent or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of My mouth.\"\n \n What else can He say? Can God overlook the sin of those who have borne His Name in vain? There is only one way to receive grace in the hour of sin, REPENT. Confess you are wrong. Come to God for forgiveness and for the spirit of God. This is a command from God. To disobey is death, for He says, \" I will make war with you with the sword in My mouth.\" The beast made war with the saints, but God will make war with the beast. Those who fought the Word will one day find the Word fighting them. It is a serious thing to take from, or add to the Word of God. For those who changed it and did with it as it suited them, what will their end be but death and destruction? But still the grace of God cried out, \"Repent.\" Oh , how sweet are the thoughts of repentance. \n Nothing in my hands I bring, simply to Thy cross I cling. I bring my sorrow. I repent that I am what I am, and what I have done. Now it is the blood, nothing but the blood of Jesus . What will it be ? Repentance, or the sword of death\" \n It's up to you.\n \n \n \n \n \n By William Marrion",

   "It is amazing that the tract is so empty of Bible verses to back it up. So much for sola fide Christianity. I assume too that you and Wm.

It?s a warning of soon coming judgment.\n\n \n I always speak in a tongue too, it's called English! I see here already a tragic misunderstanding of Acts - when the Apostles spoke in tongues, everyone understood them and were in awe. When modern Pentecostals speak in 'tongues' is there the same miracle of understanding? No. Maybe one person can 'interpret', but this is totally different.\n \n \n And that is what Constantine and his successors did at Nicaea and after Nicaea. They invited the people of God to the convention. And when the church sat down to eat, and rose up to play(partaking of church form, ceremonies, and pagan feasts named after Christian rites) she was trapped; she had committed fornication . And God walked out.\n\n \n Obviously you despise the Bible! I say this because the Bible had not been brought together until after Nicea, therefore if God had 'walked out' the Bible isn't inspired. And this was certainly before Luther compiled the Protestant version.\n \n Council of Nicea 323\n \"In 367 AD, Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria under Constantine the Great, set forth what proved to be the final canon of New Testament books in a letter listing 27 works. In 382 AD, at a synod held at Rome under Pope Damasus, church leaders influenced by Jerome adopted this list. The list was affirmed in councils at Hippo in 393 and 419 AD under Augustine and was officially ratified at a council in Rome around 473 AD. However, that council added no books that had not already been included in most earlier lists, and excluded no books that had not already been excluded by most lists.\"\n http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mbible5.html\n \n \nWhen any man turns from the Word of God and joins a church instead of receiving the Holy Spirit, that man dies. Dead! That is what he is. Don?t join a church. Don?t get taken up with Creeds and tradition or anything that takes the place of the Word and the Spirit, or you?re dead. It?s all over. You're dead.

Actually it was a pagan feast to Astarte. \n\n \n And the point is? Is this not an example of the triumph of Christian ways over those of the pagan?\n \n The logic behind his list is so flawed. The logic goes like this: There is a Buddhist feast day. I celebrate my birthday on that same day. Simply because I celebrate on feast on the date of another, makes me a Buddhist.\n \n \n \nThey placed altars in the church. They put in images. They gave the people what they called the apostles? creed, though you can?t find it in the Bible. They taught the people ancestor worship thereby making the Roman Catholic Church the greatest spiritistic church in the world. Every foul bird was in that cage. And you have the Protestants with their organizations doing the same thing.\n\n \n Another example of the lack of historical understanding. 'Church' here refers to building. Most Christians were under threat of persecution. Do you think that they built big cathedrals? No, of course not, they prayed in houses and catacombs. Do you pray in catacombs? No. Obviously then the fact you've built a church is an 'addition' to Biblical times and should be abandoned.\n \n \nThey ate things sacrificed to idols.

I see this in the same light I see the words of the Lord, ?Except ye eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you.\n\n \n Some ate these foods, when guests of pagans. But you give the answer away by mentioning what Paul said. So, 'so what?' becomes my question\n \n \nMan shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. ? You can see that eating is actually partaking in a spiritual sense So when these people were bowing to the images, lighting candles, using pagan holidays, confessing their sins to men(all of which belongs to the devil?s religion.), they were partakers with the devil and not of the Lord. They were in idolatry whether they admitted it or not. They can talk all they want that the altars and the incense are only to remind them of the prayers of the Lord or whatever they think it means; and they can say that when they pray before the image it is just for the sake of emphasis; and that when they confess to the priest, it is really to God they are doing it to in their hearts; and when they say the priest forgives them, it is just that he is doing it in the Name of the Lord; they can say what they want but they are partaking in the well known Babylonian, Satanic religion and have joined themselves to idols and committed spiritual fornication, which means death. They are dead\n\n \n No, go read what you just said about what Paul said!\n \n \nSo the church and the state were married, The church joined up with idols. With the power of the state behind them they felt that now, ?The kingdom had come and God?s will had been enforced upon the earth. ? No wonder the Roman Catholic Church is not looking for the return of the Lord Jesus. They are not millennialists. They have their millennium right here. The pope is reigning right now and God is reigning in him. So when he comes , according to them , it has to be when the new heavens and earth are prepared. But they are wrong. That pope is the head of the false church, and there is going to be a millennium, but while that is going on he won?t be in it. He will be somewhere else.\n\n \n Hang on, are you for or against Constantine ending the persecution of Christians? Or, are you against an emperor making Christianity the only form of worship?\n \n \n \n \n Revelation 2:16 , ? Repent or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of My mouth.?\n \n What else can He say? Can God overlook the sin of those who have borne His Name in vain? There is only one way to receive grace in the hour of sin, REPENT. Confess you are wrong. Come to God for forgiveness and for the spirit of God. This is a command from God. To disobey is death, for He says, ? I will make war with you with the sword in My mouth.? The beast made war with the saints, but God will make war with the beast. Those who fought the Word will one day find the Word fighting them. It is a serious thing to take from, or add to the Word of God. For those who changed it and did with it as it suited them, what will their end be but death and destruction? But still the grace of God cried out, ?Repent.? Oh , how sweet are the thoughts of repentance. \n Nothing in my hands I bring, simply to Thy cross I cling. I bring my sorrow. I repent that I am what I am, and what I have done. Now it is the blood, nothing but the blood of Jesus . What will it be ? Repentance, or the sword of death? \n It?s up to you.\n \n By William Marrion\n\n \n I think this William Marrion is probably the most anti-Christian writer I've ever read... if this is typical of his rantings. He hardly quotes the Bible at all to back up his arguments, so his beliefs aren't even rooted in Christian thought. Then he rants against joining any church. This seems to me to be the work of the devil, to drive people away from their fellow Christians in scorn and hate. And further, the fact he can't barely touch the Word of God leads me to think that he truly despises this work of great love.\n \n And as I said, he obviously despises the Bible, because he claims that God had abandoned the Church before it had compiled it.\n \n Sure, okay there's a few Bible passages at the end, but they're totally out of context. I could easily write a fact-less tract about G W Bush and then end it, \"So repent all of you for it is written in Revelations\" and then spill off a few passages.",

   "Revelation 1:1-20\n 1. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified [it] by his angel unto his servant John: \n \n \n 2. Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.\n \n 3. Blessed [is] he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time [is] at hand.\n \n \n 4. John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;\n \n \n 5. And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,\n \n 6. And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.\n \n 7. Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they [also] which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.\n \n 8. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.\n \n 9. I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.\n \n \n \n 10. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, \n \n 11. Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send [it] unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.\n \n 12. And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;\n \n 13. And in the midst of the seven candlesticks [one] like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.\n \n 14. His head and [his] hairs [were] white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes [were] as a flame of fire;\n \n 15. And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.\n \n 16. And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance [was] as the sun shineth in his strength.\n \n 17. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:\n \n 18. I [am] he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.\n \n 19. Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;\n \n 20. The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.\n \n * \n Introduction to Chapter one\n \n \n \n Rev. 1:1-3. \"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him , to shew unto His servants things which must shortly come to pass; and He sent and signified it by His angel unto His servant John; who bare record of the Word of God,and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all the things that he saw.\n Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the Words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: For the time is at hand.\"\n The scribe(not author) of this book is St. John the divine.\n Historians agree that he lived the last part of his life in Ephesus, though at the time of the writing of this book he was on the Isle of Patmos. It is not the life story of John, but it is the Revelation of Jesus Christ in the future ages, In verse three it is called a prophecy and that is actually what it is.\n This book is usually termed the Revelation of Jesus Christ given to John for Christians of all ages. It is the only book in the entire Bible that is written by Jesus Himself, through personally appearing to a scribe\n \n It is the last book of the Bible, yet it tells the beginning and the end of the dispensations of the Gospel.\n \n Now the Greek word for revelation is \"apocalypse\" which means \"unveiling\". This \"unveiling\" is perfectly described in the example of a sculptor unveiling his work of statuary, exposing it to the onlooker. It is an uncovering, revealing what was previously hidden.\n Now the uncovering is not only the revelation of the Person of Christ, but it is THE REVELATION OF HIS FUTURE WORKS IN THE ONCOMING SEVEN CHURCH AGES.\n \n The importance of revelation by the Spirit to a true believer can never be over emphasized. Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize. Now I am not talking about this Book of Revelation and you. I am talking about ALL revelation. It is tremendously important to the church. Do you remember in Matthew 16 where Jesus asked the disciples this question, \" Whom do men say that I the Son of Man am? And they said, Some say that Thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father Which is in heaven. And I say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\" The Roman Catholics say that the church is built upon Peter. \n Now that really is carnal. How could God build the church upon a man so unstable that he denied the Lord Jesus and cursed while doing it? God can't build His church upon any man born in sin. And it wasn't some rock lying there as though God had hallowed the ground at the spot. And it isn't as the Protestants say, that the church is built upon Jesus. It was the REVELATION . Read it the way it is written: \" Flesh and blood hath not REVEALED it, BUT MY FATHER HATH REVEALED IT, and UPON THIS ROCK( REVELATION) I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH:\" The church is built on REVELATION, ON THE \"Thus Saith the Lord.\" \n \n \n How did Abel know what to do in order to offer a proper sacrifice to God? By faith he received the revelation of the blood. \n Cain didn't get such a revelation( even though he had a commandment) so he couldn't offer the right sacrifice. It was a revelation from God that made the difference and gave Abel eternal life. Now you might take what the pastor says, or what the seminary teaches, and though it be taught to you with eloquence, until God reveals to you that Jesus is the Christ, and that it is the blood that cleanses you , and that God is your Saviour, you will never have eternal life. It is the Spiritual revelation that does it.\n \n \n Now I said that this Book of Revelation is the revelation of Jesus and what He is doing in the churches for those seven ages.\n It is a revelation because the disciples, themselves, didn't know these recorded truths. It had not been previously revealed to them ....ect.........\n \n \n excerpt by W. B",

   "\n Now notice that Constantine gave special feasts unto the people. They were the old pagan feasts with new names taken from the church, or in some cases Christian rites were taken and abused with pagan ceremonies.(...) And they took the feast to Astarte and called it the Easter celebration wherein the Christian is supposed to celebrate the death and resurrection of the Lord. Actually it was a pagan feast to Astarte.\n \n \n \n\n And the point is? Is this not an example of the triumph of Christian ways over those of the pagan?\n \n The logic behind his list is so flawed. The logic goes like this: There is a Buddhist feast day. I celebrate my birthday on that same day. Simply because I celebrate on feast on the date of another, makes me a Buddhist.\n\n \n Actually, montalban, a more accurate comparison would be if the village were about to celebrate your birthday, so the Buddist leaders told them that really they were celebrating the birth of Buddha instead. Then they did Buddhist conversion ceremonies on all of you, and every year you continued to celebrate Buddha's birthday (although the drawings of Buddha had a strong resemblance to a plumb baby montalban).\n \n The pagan feasts came first, montalban, and the \"events\" supposedly celebrated came afterwards. That is, the celebration of Christ's birth, resurrection, etc., are not listed in the Bible when the ways of pleasing God after Christ made sacrifice unnecessary were explained. It is clearly stated that the Sabbath must be observed, but Christmas and Easter aren't ever mentioned.\n \n I know you're going to quote tons of old blather from your \"Holy Fathers\" or whatever you call them, but no amount of apologism can argue with the fact that the Church explicitely took on pagan celebrations to increase conversions, and gave them superficial pseudo-Christian names. Goddess Brigid became St Brigid, the yule log and Santa somehow get thrown in with the nativity, and the resurrection gets spiced up with... eggs and bunny rabbits (because this was originally a fertility celebration). \n \n As for the snake spectre, you're right rapture, it was Satan. In fact, He's in your room right now.... mouahaha! http://users.telenet.be/eforum/emoticons4u/evil/612.gif\n \n emoticon_rolleyes",

   "what if i could prove, using the bible, that 'the father, the son, and the holy spirit' are three different entities? also, that you may blaspheme god, for he forgives you, but you cannot blaspheme the third entitie, the holy ghost, for he does not.\n\n \n I would not likely accept your proof. The bible refers to all three persons as God. There is one God. The bible also says this. You may try to prove it but I would question your hemaneutics. The first rule of which says that the bible does not contradict itself. So all scripture must be read in that light.",

They are still one God. This is the doctrine of the Trinity. They are three AND they are one.\n \n A similar doctrine is Jesus is God AND Jesus is Human. He is completely both.
