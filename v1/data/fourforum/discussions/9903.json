   "O my soul, do not aspire to immortal life, but exhaust the limits of the possible - Pindar\n \n The Theistic Deception by Nature\n We were tricked! The cognitive bond between the consciousness of mortality and belief in the divine remains the most primal, critical and enduring aspect of the human psyche. I argue the 2 conditions are inextricably interdependent; faith is an utterly instinctual corollary of man's awareness to his mortality. Theisms, no matter the creed, are nothing more than survival mechanisms driven by the consciousness of mortality, and in turn a rejection of unceasing death.\n \n Man hates pain, loathes hunger and detests cold. He has no option but to revile distress and privation; his physical self won't bear it. In response to the eternal environmental hazards, man built defences - from ancient Sumer to modern day Sumatra, man has struggled to prevail against the natural forces of his own atrophy. In short the history of man is defined by a tremendous protracted brawl against the elements that ceaselessly hound his existence. This much is self-evident. \n \n The battle with wild brutality is being won in man's favor, has been since the time of Zoroaster. Fears of hunger and bloodshed ebb and the less harried man investigates his world beyond the violence of primary needs. He invents. Now he lives from year to year not from feed to feed. He learns that foe and famine are not the sole destroyers of life, and death is inescapable no matter how deep he is concealed in the sanctuary of Plato's cave. The menace of mortality gathers before him and the pangs of despair tear him deeper than any arrow head slung by the enemy.\n \n Histrionical stuff, but essential to illustrate the assertion that ancients reacted to the threat of mortality analogous to the method in which the dangers of invasion and starvation were encountered - they planned for it. It is inconceivable that the scheming savage crafted spear heads in preparation for the enemy tribe only to neglect the largest peril of mortal nihility. Put it another way, how does the thinking savage, who woken to the fact of his inevitable demise (and tribe) psychologically respond? Can he ignore mortality? Impossible! As much as his famished belly won't tolerate hunger, his anguished head won't stand for everlasting mortality. Permanent death can not be reconciled to the primitive consumed by a pure instinct to live. Thus the tribesman intuitively retaliates by inventing, erecting an eschatological barrier against the ultimate threat. He manufactures god, he forges immortality and cultivates faith. It is no coincidence that every tribe of all time possessed a culturally specific pantheon and netherworld; it is also no fluke these paganistic tribes apprehended the ultimate dread. But this compulsory survival mechanism, this biological compulsion for faith courses deeper than the Marxian task of opiating the restless hoi polloi. It has a Darwinist imperative that literally binds man to Nature; a utility predating exploitation applications.\n \n \n A Short Nasty Atheistic World \n Imagine theteeming transfixed masses of 'theocratic' Java divested of religion - be it Animism, Buddhism, Christianity or Islam. If you think the fervor of Islam can be chaotic, then picture an Indonesia gutted of faith. In its theistic stead, is a Camusist existentialism fixated on impassable mortality, where unconquerable meaningless existence is embraced by the collective conscious as truth. This is not so much a dilemma for the zealous few, rather, for the uncommitted bulk of humanity, who forever alert to the prospect of divinity, stake their agnostic lives on the side of conformity, indecision and optimism. This inhibitor of an indecipherable genesis is a tight harness indeed, pinning mankind on the fence of doubt, suspending him between realism and idealism. It is this intellectual floundering by mankind in the purposive void of an absolute teleology that tethers him to Nature. Nature has deceived him, and with reason! As without the calmative of a metaphysical uncertainty, mankind might find himself in an appalling, if not extinct state. This is the grand paradox of supernatural belief, of faith - man had no choice, but to believe, to conjure. He had to self-delude to persevere, to survive, because the alternative to myth-making was the insurmountable mental barrier of cruel futility. It was one or the other! Everything about man, from his toe nails to his nostril hairs is engineered to engage the adversities of life, with the brain being his foremost weapon in the biological arsenal. And it was intellect, acting on self-preservation impulse that fabricated the myth of spirituality in resistance to the ultimate assault of nihility. Strip mankind of spirituality and he will stand naked against the searing reality of hopeless Epicurean mortality, and all his inhibitions farmed through the millenninia, will peel away to unleash a maelstrom of narcissistic aggression that would threaten the very existence of Nature herself. This premise becomes the most plausible explanation for our exasperating incapacity to divine our own nature - Nature withholds it for both her and our welfare. Ah how are we to prove such, how much longer can Nature lock us in check. The fool scientist infatuated with causality can't see the tree for the forest, there's a cause behind our universal witlessness and it is called instinct. This knowledge was always inside our skulls, lost in the vapor of tranquilizing mythos! \n \n Man is ultimately a product of Nature. Cunning Nature gifted man with sufficient intelligence to compel him to endlessly and aimlessly thrash about on earth, though capped his unique supra-animal quality stupefying him to the nature of his existence. Based on this [unrefined & abbreviated] logic therefore, the chronic philosophical crisis that the origin of existence is unknowable implies: - (a) it is in the interest of Nature for mankind to remain bewildered to his own nature; and the logical extension from a, (b) the finality of mortality or reality of nihility. On the balance of probabilities (or evidence), this godless speculation heavily outweighs creationism, because this instinctual concoction, unlike its evolutionist opposite, is bereft of tangible evidence, and to a lesser extent rationale. \n \n Finally, visualize a world where the school teacher lectures, as the unassailable scientific truth, fleeting life, regardless how piously lived, earns endless death. And the principal instruction of this ontological lesson is carpe diem. Would not men everywhere rightly thirst for urgent gratification and yield to no authority other than to the commands of his instincts? \"When god is dead\" writes Dostoyevsky, \"anything is permissible\". Nature has done well to hide the truth.\n \n Jackamarra",

On a side note, you've never heard of Pascal's wager?\n \n \n \n I also repeat to James in the hope that he will actually answer (and this is one problem with the good old Pascal's Wager): \"Which God?\"\n\n \n I am guilty of attempting sarcasm, sorry. I should have been more direct and simply said that it is an old chestnut that is a rather lame argument and has been refuted often and completely. \n \n Sam Harris says it better than I:\n \nWhile Pascal deserves his reputation as a brilliant mathematician, his wager was never more than a cute (and false) analogy. Like many cute ideas in philosophy, it is easily remembered and often repeated, and this has lent it an undeserved air of profundity. If the wager were valid, it could be used to justify any belief system (no matter how ludicrous) as a \"good bet.\" Muslims could use it to support the claim that Jesus was not divine (the Koran states that anyone who believes in the divinity of Jesus will wind up in hell); Buddhists could use it to support the doctrine of karma and rebirth; and the editors of TIME could use it to persuade the world that anyone who reads Newsweek is destined for a fiery damnation.\n \n But the greatest problem with the wager-and it is a problem that infects religious thinking generally-is its suggestion that a rational person can knowingly will himself to believe a proposition for which he has no evidence. A person can profess any creed he likes, of course, but to really believe something, he must also believe that the belief under consideration is true. To believe that there is a God, for instance, is to believe that you are not just fooling yourself; it is to believe that you stand in some relation to God's existence such that, if He didn't exist, you wouldn't believe in him. How does Pascal's wager fit into this scheme? It doesn't.\n \n Beliefs are not like clothing: comfort, utility, and attractiveness cannot be one's conscious criteria for acquiring them. It is true that people often believe things for bad reasons-self-deception, wishful thinking, and a wide variety of other cognitive biases really do cloud our thinking-but bad reasons only tend to work when they are unrecognized. Pascal's wager suggests that a rational person can knowingly believe a proposition purely out of concern for his future gratification. I suspect no one ever acquires his religious beliefs in this way (Pascal certainly didn't). But even if some people do, who could be so foolish as to think that such beliefs are likely to be true?\n \n",

   "To anyone who has read the entire thread, it's obvious that my riposte to Jack O' Marra wasn't meant to \"lead anywhere\" or to prove anything. It was meant only to show that, from the atheist point of view, it's not a good idea to cite Pascal.\n \n Pascal combined scepticism with belief in the God of Christianity.
