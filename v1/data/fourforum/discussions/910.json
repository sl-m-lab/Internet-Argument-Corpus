   "I heard an interesting argument yesterday between two people talking about whether the Big Bang actually occurred or not. One of them took the position that the Big Bang couldn't have occurred because assuming every single planet in our solar system started out in one spot and assuming nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, then all stars should already be visible in our night sky and no more should ever show up again.\n \n The reason for this is that after the Big Bang, the section that became Earth shot off in one direction at the speed of light or less and other chunks of rock did the same. As of right now it has been some billions years since the Big Bang and the light from some of the more distant stars are just now reaching us. How is it possible that they are just reaching us? How did those stars travel away from Earth so quickly that their light wasn't even visible to Earth?\n \n I don't know if I'm explaining this too well since in his argument he used a picture. Basically it showed one piece marked Earth heading upwards and one piece marked unknown star heading downwards. He then drew a line of light coming from the unknown star right away and it reaching the Earth particle and said that if Earth was heading straight away from it at light speed, then the light from the unknown star could only ever be out of the sight of Earth by the same distance that the two particles were apart when the Big Bang occurred unless the light got blocked somehow in which case it could be further behind, but it would take a very random act of chance for it to fall behind by billions of years.\n \n Let me know if I'm not explaining this well enough and I'll try again :)\n \n Anyways, I see his point and it seems to make sense. Unless the Big Bang planet was so large that it would take light millions and millions of years to cross from one side of it to the other, how could any star actually outpace Earth by so much that its light would become billions of years away from us? Especially if Earth isn't moving through the solar system at light speed right now and not many other starts are doing so, how is it possible that all the light from all the stars haven't become visible here on Earth? Also, if the Big Bang is proven true, does that mean that planets may actually be able to go beyond the speed of light or that there are things about time that we don't understand yet?",

   "I am by no means a physics expert, but I would like to point out a few mistakes here. First I am a little unclear as to the argument, but the big thing that sticks out here is the fact that you seem to state that the universe and material in it (planets) was fully formed at the moment of the big bang. As I recall, the only elements that were present shortly after the big bang were hydrogen, and possibly some helium. Therefore, there is absolutely no way planets could be formed at the beginning of the universe. Once gravitational forces pulled enough hydrogen atoms together to form stars did the possiblity for planet formation begin, as I believe planetary material is formed from the remains of stars (supernovas?). Therefore, it would be a while before planets were formed. This answer is far from complete, and I would have to go look much more information up before I say anything more, just to make sure I am not completely wrong.",

   "I don't usually come down here the the science board because contrary to the title, the discussions seem wander far from science into the realm of fantasy.\n \nI heard an interesting argument yesterday between two people talking about whether the Big Bang actually occurred or not. One of them took the position that the Big Bang couldn't have occurred because assuming every single planet in our solar system started out in one spot and assuming nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, then all stars should already be visible in our night sky and no more should ever show up again.\n\n But the big bang (it isn't necessary to capitalize the names of theories) isn't an assumption. It is a conclusion. We see that everything in the universe is moving away from everything else. (There are exceptions caused by gravity, like galaxy clusters and the great attractor). Now it is reasonable to conclude that if everything is moving away, in other words that the universe is expanding, then in the distant past things were closer. If you keep following that line of reasoning, at some point in the past everything expanded from a single point.\n \n Recent evidence has shown that that initial expansion began about 13.7 billion years ago. And the limit at which we can see objects is a bit closer than that. We don't actually see any new stars, we only see what is out there with greater clarity. When the Hubble Space Telescope was fixed it was pointed at a spot in the sky away from the plane of the Milky Way. The spot was in the neighborhood of Polaris. it was dark area between stars where nothing had ever been by any earth-bound telescopes. A relatively long exposure was made. The result was the Hubble deep field (north) picture. If is full of galaxies and dots of light that can only be galaxies at that distance. So I think that it is true that we won't be seeing any new stars because their light is just reaching earth. As far as we are able to look, we see stars (galaxies, actually). The new ones are discoveries rather than light just arriving.\n \nThe reason for this is that after the Big Bang, the section that became Earth shot off in one direction at the speed of light or less and other chunks of rock did the same.\n\n Well, there weren't any chunks of rock at the time of the big bang, only what is called plasma. You'll have to get a book on the subject to get an adequate explanation. Cosmology is not my field although I find it interesting. Let me recommend a couple books that a layman can grasp. The Whole Shebang: A State-of-the-Universe(s) Report by Timothy Ferris. Ferris is a Professor (emeritus) of Physics at the University of California. He has taught 5 disciplines at 3 universities. Once when I cited Ferris, a creationist found out that he taught in the department of journalism at UC Berkeley and dismissed his opinion. Yes he did teach in the department of journalism - a course on scientific writing for science majors. Ferris also taught physics, astrophysics and astronomy. Another book is Wrinkles in Time by George Smoot and Keay Davidson. Smoot is an astrophysicist and Davidson is a science writer. The book is the story of the COBE experiments that essentially confirmed the big bang theory and solved some problems.\n \n Finally, there is the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) site. Click on the universe tab for a good tutorial on cosmology. http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm.html\n \nAs of right now it has been some billions years since the Big Bang and the light from some of the more distant stars are just now reaching us. How is it possible that they are just reaching us? How did those stars travel away from Earth so quickly that their light wasn't even visible to Earth?\n\n That's just not logical. Of course the light from distant stars is just reaching us. It has been for as long as the earth has existed. If any part of the universe moved away from us at speeds greater than the speed of light, they are forever outside of our view. The result would not be that it would take longer for the light to reach us but that it would never reach us. But light from objects that are moving away at less than the speed of light has always reached us even if we lacked the technology to detect it, but it is red shifted.\n \nI don't know if I'm explaining this too well since in his argument he used a picture. Basically it showed one piece marked Earth heading upwards and one piece marked unknown star heading downwards. He then drew a line of light coming from the unknown star right away and it reaching the Earth particle and said that if Earth was heading straight away from it at light speed, then the light from the unknown star could only ever be out of the sight of Earth by the same distance that the two particles were apart when the Big Bang occurred unless the light got blocked somehow in which case it could be further behind, but it would take a very random act of chance for it to fall behind by billions of years.\n \n Let me know if I'm not explaining this well enough and I'll try again\n\n I don't know that explaining it would help. At the instance of the big bang the earth didn't exist and neither did this hypothetical star that we can't see. Perhaps Hawking's Universe in a Nutshell might also help with the concepts.\n \nAnyways, I see his point and it seems to make sense. Unless the Big Bang planet was so large that it would take light millions and millions of years to cross from one side of it to the other, how could any star actually outpace Earth by so much that its light would become billions of years away from us? Especially if Earth isn't moving through the solar system at light speed right now and not many other starts are doing so, how is it possible that all the light from all the stars haven't become visible here on Earth? Also, if the Big Bang is proven true, does that mean that planets may actually be able to go beyond the speed of light or that there are things about time that we don't understand yet?\n\n Yea. That's the problem with quacks. Their explanations always sound so rational. The big bang wasn't a planet. Neither time nor space existed, and physicists can't even describe the singularity or any of the physics for the first 10^-43 seconds.\n \n One huge problem for amateurs presented by crackpot ideas about science is our inability to address them because of our ignorance. I have read enough about the topic to realize that it is pure balderdash, even if your translation doesn't represent it adequately. But I am not an astrophysicist nor a cosmologist. I understand in principle but need to go back to the books to answer in detail. I can do that, but it isn't my problem. Another problem is that it will take you several weeks of reading to grasp the fundamentals, and by that time the discussion is over and your opponent has claimed victory because no one is educated in a complex and difficult field of science to debunk his claptrap. It is a device that works well for creationists.",

   "Edward Hubble even to Einstines suprise proved beyond resonable doubt that the universe is expanding. Whats more it seems to be excellerating. This forced Einsien to remove his cosmilogical constant from Special Relitivity, he latter admited it was the biggest mistake of his life.\n \n Relitivity theory alone was elegent and solved a whole host of scientific problems. However it also suggested the universe acted in a state of inertia. This was dificult to believe in the early twentyeth century as the steady state predominated cosmilogical theory. The cause of this I believe is because of the wait of Theoligy. This is why Einstien added the cosmilogical constant to Special Realitivity. The cosmilogical constant was denounced by Einstien himself and is not accepted by any physicists, as Edward Hubble through the use of the doplar spectrum shift with in light proves that the majority of Galixies are excelerating away from each other. This galactic expansion actualy fasilitates the creation of time space.\n \n It is incorect to imply the big bang occured 14 000 000 000 billion years ago as we are living in it. This expansion has never ended. It continues as you read. It is also incorect to imply that the big bang never occured as we can deduce from the given speeds of celestial objects that all matter and energy orriginated from the same central point.\n \n I will try to explain my knowledge of reality in more simple terms. It is dificult to explain reality with in a scientific context as science deals with complexity. To under stand physics one must understand what : Timespace, Fields, Matter, Singularitys, Dopplarshift, Light, Antimatter, and the basics of Quantum, Newtonian and Realitivity. These things are broken down by the human mind. We give them names and say they are different. I can explain how all of these things are the same thing however not in a scientific context. The problem is science deals with complexity. We know that complexity is balanced by order. This duality is governed by a third force which unites both. Phylosiphy seems to most a uninspired, dificult, concept to grasp. I have found one can understand ones environment throught the use of the mind alone. The method of thought I use is known as Taoism.\n \n I do not mean to be rude but if one can not engage me on a scientific level do not blame my english teachers the system is far from perfect. If one can not understand the complexity of temporal physics mabe one should try engaging me on a philisophical level. I understand the universe and the way it functions through the collective teachings of the Masters of Old.\n \n Zombie it should be clear to you that science and reductionism have failed. These can not discribe the universe. Holistic thought can. Please correct my unproven assertions but do not reduce my work. It is very rude to take one out of context. I am simply trying to share my knowledge. Is it not true that even most ignorant of men has valuble insight. Let us have a constructive dialougue and we may hammer out the differences in our own understandings.",

The Doppler Red Shift is dependent on the angle that a star is moving away from you. The magnitude of the shift is proportional to the relative velocity vector. For example, if the star is traveling perpendicular to your point of reference, there isn't a red shift, but as the angle approaches 180 degrees from reference, it's at its maximum.\n As for the wavelength of light emitted, (as observed from a fixed reference frame) I believe that's governed by the physics of nuclear fusion and should be independent of the star's size.",

   "It seems to me that there is some misunderstanding of what is meant by \"red shift.\" It does not mean the the perceived light becomes \"redder.\" As was pointed out, the blue of the sky and the red of the sunset are not caused by \"red shift.\"\n \n When light is red shifted the wavelength of the light is increased by the relative motion of the source from the observer. But since all of the electromagnetic radiation is increased in wave length, the light would not appear redder. The same would be true of blue shift, the Andromeda galaxy for example. What happens is that the high frequency EM is shifted into the ultra-violet, the ultra-violet into the visible range, and so on until the red light is shifted into the infra-red and the infra-red into the low frequency EM spectrum. The light would still appear as light. And of course, just the opposite shift takes place for blue shifting.\n \n So how can we tell that the light is red (or blue) shifted? By examining spectral lines. There are actually two different phenomena that show red shifting.\n \n One is in the emission lines where the presence of certain elements in the source is recognized by a bright line in the spectrum. It was the analysis of these lines from which Hubble first hypothesized an expanding universe. The idea is really quite simple; in an expanding universe those objects that are farthest away from us should also be moving away from us at a faster rate and therefore show more red shift. This has been tested on some objects whose distance can be measured by other means and has been found to hold true. By the way, this isn't actually the Doppler effect. The objects are not really \"moving away from us.\" The distance between them and us is expanding because of the expansion of the universe and we see that as a red shift in the spectral emission lines. However, the Doppler effect is a pretty close analogy.\n \n The other phenomenon is absorption lines in the spectrum caused as the light from distant stars pass through gas clouds. Normally, the absorption lines caused by an element are at the same place in the spectrum as the emission lines. However, since these gas clouds are closer to us than the emitting star they should be expanding away from us at a slower rate. Therefore, the red shift of the absorption lines should be less than that of the emission line. This has also been found to be almost universally true. In fact, light from very distant objects pass through many gas clouds and the light is absorbed at several different red shifts. Thus we can see a phenomenon known as the Lyman alpha forest, a region of red shifted absorption lines of the same elements. This region is always blue-ward of the emission lines.\n \n Glad that this thread was resurrected.",

   "It seems to me that there is some misunderstanding of what is meant by \"red shift.\" It does not mean the the perceived light becomes \"redder.\" As was pointed out, the blue of the sky and the red of the sunset are not caused by \"red shift.\"\n \n When light is red shifted the wavelength of the light is increased by the relative motion of the source from the observer. But since all of the electromagnetic radiation is increased in wave length, the light would not appear redder. The same would be true of blue shift, the Andromeda galaxy for example. What happens is that the high frequency EM is shifted into the ultra-violet, the ultra-violet into the visible range, and so on until the red light is shifted into the infra-red and the infra-red into the low frequency EM spectrum. The light would still appear as light. And of course, just the opposite shift takes place for blue shifting.\n \n So how can we tell that the light is red (or blue) shifted? By examining spectral lines. There are actually two different phenomena that show red shifting.\n \n One is in the emission lines where the presence of certain elements in the source is recognized by a bright line in the spectrum. It was the analysis of these lines from which Hubble first hypothesized an expanding universe. The idea is really quite simple; in an expanding universe those objects that are farthest away from us should also be moving away from us at a faster rate and therefore show more red shift. This has been tested on some objects whose distance can be measured by other means and has been found to hold true. By the way, this isn't actually the Doppler effect. The objects are not really \"moving away from us.\" The distance between them and us is expanding because of the expansion of the universe and we see that as a red shift in the spectral emission lines. However, the Doppler effect is a pretty close analogy.\n \n The other phenomenon is absorption lines in the spectrum caused as the light from distant stars pass through gas clouds. Normally, the absorption lines caused by an element are at the same place in the spectrum as the emission lines.
