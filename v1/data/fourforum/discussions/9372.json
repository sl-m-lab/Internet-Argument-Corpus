The verdict brought swift condemnation from Europe and from international human rights groups. VOA Correspondent Challiss McDonough has more from our Middle East bureau in Cairo.\n \n The court issued the death sentences after convicting five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor of deliberately infecting more than 400 children with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. \n \n A defense lawyer said the trial was unfair and the verdict will be appealed.\n \n The defendants have been imprisoned for seven years. This is the second time they have been sentenced to death. A first trial verdict was overturned in 2005 and a new trial was ordered, after an international outcry over the fairness of the proceedings.\n \n Human rights groups and AIDS scientists say the second trial was no better. The court refused to throw out the confessions of three of the accused, which they have repeatedly said were obtained under torture.\n\n \n Kudos to the Libyan court for ignoring scientific and expert mumbo jumbo. After all, what could possibly be more reliable than a confession obtained under torture?\n \n It occurs to me that this is actually kind of scary, since our own justice system seems to parallel this in many cases. Capture somebody who seems suspicious, then torture them until they confess. The only real difference would seem to be that in Libya, they have the right to an open and public trial regardless of circumstances, the nature of the crime, or the nationality of the accused. In the US, there are no such gaurantees for certain accused individuals.\n \n With the super neat changes that we have made to our system, this could happen RIGHT HERE in the US...the only difference being that there would be no international outcry because, unlike syria, we could do it secretly...the public would never have to know...an obvious improvement over syrias legal system.",
