If the people have the right to put a plate like that on their car, and there is a good enough demand for a plate like that, then the state should have the right to make the plate.\n\n \n That is a non sequitur.\n \n Instead of the CBF, try a cross, or that fish representing Jesus, or a picture of a naked woman. Your statement, which I quoted above, would not change the least bit, but you would hardly stand by the conclusion.\n \n In the first two cases, the state would clearly be violating the 1st Amendment (just as clear as the individuals who would use such plates, were they available, would clearly have the 1st Am. right to do so). The third case is a close analogy with the CBF - the problem is that more-or-less identifialble classes of individuals would be offended and/or feel discriminated against. Again, as individual, you have the 1st Am. right to offensive and even to discriminatory speech, but the state does not have such rights, and the offended individuals have the 14th Amendment equal protection rights. Women in my hypothetical example and blacks in the actual CBF example could raise the equal protection issue. Women would be successful in every court in this country, and I don't see any reason (other than personal political preferences of judges) why blacks should not be.\n \n This is also why I think the pro-life message is constitutional. Many people would be offended, but being pro-choice, or having had an abortion, does not classify you in a way relevant for equal protection purposes - it is not like race, sex, or religious persuasion. And while the state may not prohibit abortion, it may (as far as I know) declaratively encourage certain choices.\n \n In this sense, \"choose life\" plate is legally probably on the same footing with \"protect endangered species\" plates: both endorse one side in a political debate. However, while environmentalist plates might irk George Bush or Milton Friedman, they are unlikely to throw anyone into a road rage. With emotionally charged issues like abortion, that is not the case. That is why I think it is a terrible policy for a state to issue plates with such messages.",

Sorry, but my knowledge of the US civil war is pretty much limited to South Park!\n\n One was the &#8220;official&#8221; Flag of the Confederacy, the other was the standard Battle Flag.\n \nI wouldn't worry, so is that of most of the young kids that are flying the flag.\n \n Waxy\n\n :p emoticon_rolleyes So true!",

Those that use racial slurs can taunt, but only to a certain point, depending on the one being insulted. Using the law, and having a level head, one can stop it from that individual, but there&#8217;s always another waiting in the wings.\n I am at the point now that when someone racially insults me, I embarrass them by asking them what it means (which I know for the most part &#8211; hate and disgust). \n &#8220;Is that directed towards me or my kind?&#8221;\n &#8220;Yea, (insert slur here).&#8221;\n &#8220;Which one? Because I don&#8217;t know you, do I?&#8221;\n &#8220;(insert vulgar language and slurs)!&#8221;\n &#8220;If you don&#8217;t know me then you have no reason to speak to me. If you have anything other than words, then do it.&#8221;\n If he or she puts a hand on me, I then proceed to do all I have been taught to do to defend myself. That is all within the law.\n It will stop that altercation, but like I said, there&#8217;s another waiting to happen.\n \n So, unless you&#8217;re willing to do that, then I would suggest to take the insult and walk away.\n \n Years ago I was told to &#8220;let it go.&#8221; But, that just fuels the flame&#8230;and I learned that the hard way. These racists are like hyenas, they love to pick out and attack the weak.\n \n I won&#8217;t tolerate it.",

   "First of all let me say that no one is more upset by the fact that organization such as the Klu Klux Klan uses the confederate battle flag as a representation of their beliefs. Personally, I have lived next door to two black families most of my life and grew up with their children. When I was young, there was not hardly a weekend that I was either over at their house or they were at mine. Almost all of my families get to gathers involved them and vice versa. And yet my father alway had a confederate battle flag flying on a pole out side of our house. Neither of these black familes cared or they would not have sent their children over. So to me the battle flag doesn't stand for anything racial. From what I have read, most of you don't see the point of displaying the confederate battle flag. I have not read all of the posts but I am sure that \"pride\" has been brought up along with several other words that have just been repeated until they sound like a broken record. For me, I was raised with the confederate flag. It has always been in my life. I can't explain it but I feel good inside when ever I see it, it is kind of like going back home after years being away. But now days it means even more. Now days I am being told by people that the Confederate battle flag is wrong. I have actually had some people who ,when they saw me with a dixie outfitters shirt on, acted as though I just opened up my trenchcoat and flashed them. I am a big family historian and I am not ashamed to admite that every branch of my family fought for or supported the Confederacy during the war. I am no more proud of my confederate ancestors than I am of my World War II, WWI, Rev. War, ect. But when I display an American flag on my grandfathers grave for his service in World War II, people don't care as with that of my WWI ancestor. Infact I have had people who were so delighted that I did this that they had to come up and shake my and and talke to me about my grandfather. But I am not supposed to display a Confederate Battle at all even on graves. Beleave it or not, I can understand and support not haveing the battle flag flying at State Capital Buildings but the whole ridiculous political correctness as gotten out of hand. Yes, beleave it or not, I have a sever problem with someone telling me that I can not honer an ancestor because it makes them feel bad. I live in Georgia, and several years ago, our then governor removed Georgias state flage with the Confederate Battle flag on it and replaced it with a Blue Flag that looked more like a table cloth than a flag. He just got rid of it and us Georgians never got to vote on the issue. Before this time, I had never seen a Georgia State flag flying anywhere except on Government buildings and schools but after The old Georgia Flag was taken down suddenly they were everywhere. I can't speak for everybody, just myself but I show a confederate battle flag every single time I can just in spite to show hey you may not like it but I am still going to fly it. See what people who don't live in the South Don't understand is that a lot of the flag issue is taught to us unknowingly from our parents as we watch and learn from their every move growing up. I don't know if I can explain to you the reason why I feel so much pride when I see the confederate battle flag. Bottom line, no body worries if I get upset, if I am offinded by something that happens or a symble and so I am going to give the same consideration. But you know, even if someone out there did care if I was offended I would still keep it to my self. The Confederate battle flag is a symbol and as such I suppose its meaning is left to the eye of the beholder. But these flags were not created as hate symbols, they were created as symbols of a nation. True the phisical fabric of this nation has long been distroyed but I think that its spirit lives on, not so say the south will rise again, that is not what I mean. I think the best thing this country can do is to just let everybody alone. Everybody in the country today is complaining. Religous people compaining because someone wants a monument moved and the non religous complaining because it is not being moved and then we have all of this political correctness. Look people this is the price of living in a free nation. Everybody is free to their own opinons but your own personal opinions are not always correct. Everytime you see someone displaying a confederate battle flag, you have the right to say something to them, (short of starting a fight) and you have the right to think what ever about them you choose whether you think they are racist or just ignorant. But just the same, they have the right to display the CBF. I am sure nobody loses sleep at night because someone displays a confederate battle flag. I keep hearing from people, why don't you just move on, forget the past. My reply is simple. Why don't you move on? Let us southern people live our back woods, redneck, ignorant, racist lives and worry about living your own. The more people try to get rid of the confederate flag, the more it is going to appear. Georgia has proved that over the past four years. :)",

   "Hi, Tennessee is now going to sell license plates with the Confedeate Battle Flag on them and I just want to see what you people think about this?\n \n The news link is here http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=1347390\n \n And also a link to a board in Nashville Tennessee talking about this subject. http://www.tntalk.com\n Hello Jim 1930. Welcome aboard. emoticon_xhoho I find the Confederate Flag issue an interesting topic.\n \n Being from the North,I'm not really affected by anything it represents. I guess I'm more in favor of it than against it,from the standpoint of i feel it is an individuals right to display it.\n \n My problem with it is when it is used by radical groups such as the KKK, or anti-abortion groups for example.\n \n As far as the licence plates go,I see no difference in the plates vs.the flag.\n \n I understand a lot of people associate the symbol with fallen ancestors who died fighting under the flag,and use it as a way to pay tribute to them.\n I find in that sort of scenario, it is totally acceptable,and quite understandable.",
