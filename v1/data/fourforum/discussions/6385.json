   "Sure enough we all are currently overcoming a terrific disaster of Hurricane Katrina that caused exceeding damage to the economy of the US (according to official figures, losses are estimated between $800m and $2,7bn with over 2K people dead ). But I bet this country has ample means to remedy and temporary reduce oil prices without resort to our Early Storage Reserve. \n It's likely G. Bush finally understood his policy about Iraq went down the drain and he has to kiss a good-bye to Iraqi cheap oil. Don't you think hurricane Katrina came in handy to screen his faults? I bet it did.",

   "what worries ME most of all is that president Bush turns the tragedy to his advantage as for abrupt about-face of his policy (like he did after 9/11 tragedy).\n Indeed, I've got a frightening guess - what if both tragedies were neatly framed? Do you remember the deadly tsunami in South Asia? Dunno why but many people out there believe it was a test of the newest type of American \"geotectonic\" weapon. I have no clue how the Pentagon did this but it worked and honestly speaking, it was a complete success!\n Yet, what happened now? Maybe this time our newest weapon failed and went beyond control? And to conceal the truth it was given a name of \"hurricane Katrina\"? It sounds mystically but still... \n Yeah, I always knew it would end like this. Just like it was with al-Qaeda. Do you know the Pentagon gave rise to it but then it went out of hand and now it stands against us? Right. I think we shouldn't have done it. As the saying runs, curses come home to roost... Indeed, there's a lot president Bush has to think about.",

   "please tell me we don't have another person claiming Bush went into Iraq for the oil and then having no proof to back it up. I heard yesterday some guy claiming Bush was a racist and when I asked him why he said \"because he is from Texas\". Then I told him that Texas is helping thousands of blacks form Hurricane Katrina so you can't say everyone in Texas is racist. He said \"well, Bush is just racist\". So I asked if he just felt like saying that with no proof and he just said \"he fits the profile\". haha, the normal days of liberals.",

   "I think this storm has clearly exposed the inabilities of our current administration. \n \n 1. it's inability to lead.\n \n 2. It's inability to protect poeple in need.\n \n 3. It's inability to make good choices in a desperat situation.\n \n 4. It's inability to be prepared.\n \n 5. It's inability (or unwillingness) to chose people with experience for top positions.\n \n 6. It's inability to fix it's own internal problems.\n \n I could continue with more but why? Either this country wakes up and realises the mistake it made putting a clown like George in office, or we will continue to get the same type of lousy leadership in the next election.",
