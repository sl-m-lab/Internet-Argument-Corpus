   "First victims of Orange Revolution in Ukraine.\n It looks like witch-hunting has started in Ukraine as soon as election fever had faded away. I remember Yulia Timoshenko saying she would hang all Ukrainian pro-Yanukovich politicians on blue-and-white scarves after Yuschenko gets presidency . It looks like she keeps her promises. Ukrainian Minister of Transport and Communications Georgi Kirpa was found dead at his country house on 27 December. As we know Georgi Kirpa was one of the main figures in the election campaign of Victor Yanukovich. Now he had to forfeit his life for stand against Orange Power. It can be expected that the former Orange Opposition won't stop and there will be more victims among pro-Yanukovich officials.",

Or of course Russia could have problems with its natural gas pipelines shipping to western Ukraine causing some shortages\n\n \n Energy resources and distribution are becoming the crack cocaine for many leaders of industrialized nations. Just ask the US. I recall reading about a protest by a large group of peasants gathered in front of the sitting Tsar's summer residence. Without warning, the Commander of the Royal Guard ordered his troops to commence rifle fire on the peasants, killing 150 before they scattered. Despite their past economic collapse, Russia still has very, very sharp teeth.",

   "This is it.\n This is how it starts.\n Russia will end up intervening.\n But then the EU and countries like Poland can't just stand there \n and let Putin seize control of former Soviet Republics.\n There may be a war or some form of conflict over this.\n This could cause flare ups in the Chechen battle, which could then \n call for support from other Muslim countries.\n Who knows where this is all going.\n \n My Polish friend is afraid that Poland will end up sending troops\n somewhere at some time, and he'll be called up since he is a \n male citizen of proper age and therefore is considered in reserve.",
