   "Yulia Timoshenko will have to fight her living.\n The elections are over in Ukraine, still there is a whole lot of problems there. The main problem is the industry. To be certain, the industrial stagnation in the East of the country. The Americans invested their money into Yushenko but not into develops of the Young Democracy in Ukraine. In this situation the authorities of the country will have to search for some other sources not to let the economy to get completely ruined. Though, Ukraine might follow the example of Georgia where they started to arrest oligarchs and put them in jail so that they give away their money they had stolen from government coffers. In this respect, Yulia Timoshenko will get into a tight situation for she is fairly considered an oligarch. So she will have to protect herself along with other oligarchs in Ukraine. And she did her first steps in this direction by opposing the power reform on transforming Georgia into a parliamentary republic instead of a presidential one. We'll see what comes and who wins. I don't envy Timoshenko if she looses the political battle.",
