   "I personally think another world war is inevitable. With all these countries now developing nuclear technologies and a great hatred for each other.\n \n This is how I think it will happen (and this is only MY opinion): First, the United States gets into another skirmish with a country in the Middle East e.g. Syria or Iran. Then they underestimate their foes and end up having a lot of casualties due to suicide bombers and what not. \n \n They get all caught up in the war and think that if they leave, it will give a bad impression blah blah blah. So then another country e.g. North Korea, invades an America ally, say.... South Korea or Japan. This forces to the US to spread it's defences thin and go after North Korea and still be in Syria and/or Iran. \n \n Then either China and/or Russia take advantage of this. In China's case, it would likely go after Taiwan. Russia, might go after Eastern Europe or maybe even America itself.\n \n The thing you must know about China and Russia is: China has a regular army of almost 2 million (that is in peace-time so imagine war-time) as well as the largest tank army, advanced nuclear arsenal, gradually increasing fleet of fourth-generation jet fighter (MiG-29, Su-30MKK, etc.), perhaps the most advanced troop transports and frontline vehicals in the world, and a cyber army of hackers able to ruin a high-tech army. \n \n Russia, which most people believe it bankrupt with it's tourist space flights and MiG flights just to get money. But, the thing about the space flights, it only gives the Federally funded space agency 10 million dollars. Believe it me, it is not a lot of money for a national space agency. However, if it IS bankrupt, how can it still maintain it's army (one of the largest and most advanced in the world) much less have it \"still growing?\" Hint hint, lies. I am not sure but I think only the civilian economy is bankrupt. Their military economy is probably still at full strength and growing.\n \n Now if you add up all the steps, you already have 6 nuclear countries (with the exception of Iran and Syria) at war. It is likely the United Kingdom and other Wester European countries will get involved. I think this is the recipe for WWIII.\n \n What do you think?",

   "Come on...just another few years! The second I get my own place I am moving in a very rural area, buying a 1 million rounds of ammo, an arsenal of guns, and making my own crop. \n \n Just kidding, but seriously, China wouldn't be that stupid. Sure nukes sound bad and everything, but if you think people in china are going to do anything of the sort you have to be a bit bonkers. the main thing that is going to cause WW3 is going to be if radicalists came into power in a nuclear power. right now we are doing pretty good, Kim Jong Il being the exception, at keeping \"blow-up-the-world-to-kill-american\" thinkers out of power, and until that changes we are pretty safe.",

   "How do you know that WWIII hasn't already started? Hows this for a scenario:\n \n The Us, after several years of crappy foreign policy, is attacked by terrorists. We retaliate by attacking Afghanistan. After Afghanistan, we go against the majority of the world and attack Iraq on the basis of WMD's and terrorist ties. No WMD's or terrorist ties are found or proven, which turns world opinion against the US. The next terrorist strike involves a nuke. We find that pakistan has provided materials for the nuke, so we nuke pakistan (I think there is a good chance we actually would) then begin exerting US military influence over large portions of the middle east and Africa. Coutries in those regions retaliate by cutting off oil to the US, making things rather more difficult both on the homefront an militarily, which causes us to escalate military activity. We are met with strong resistance. Russia and China support our enemies, along with several european countries that disagree with our tactics.\n \n I seriosly doubt that future wars will include massive nuke strikes. They are just too damaging and everybody knows it. I can certainly imagine a worldwide conventional conflict.",

   "I think WWIII will begin when a massive terror attack in Israel leads to them declaring war on another country. The arab nations will begin to unite against them and the UN will try to do as much as possible to hinder the US's defense of Israel since the UN will see it as Israel being the aggresser. Israel will become the target of chemical and biological attacks and they will retaliate with stronger attacks until they go nuclear with the war. This splits the world as the US leads the fight help Israel and Russia leads the fight against Israel.",

Pakistans government could collapse at any given moment at this point in time so I doubt they want to stir any negative attention from the US when we have our military on their borders. It would make a whole lot more sense that we find out that the nuclear terror attack came from terrorists in that nation and we demand of the Pakistani government that we crack down on terrorists there along with help from a newly helpful UN. We would not declare war on Pakistan at all unless their government was directly responsible and that would be highly unlikely. The end result of this whole thing would probably be the capture of Osama in Pakistan, the end of many other terror cells in the Middle East, a more stable Pakistan, and an improved relationship between the US and the UN.\n \n I also agree that the US is cowardly in who they attack but I also think they are realistic in who they attack. Nuclear weapons have changed the face of war and it would be unrealistic to fight anyone who has a good amount of them. So to fight countries who don't have them it takes no guts at all. Therefore I would assume that it is not unexpected at all that almost all wars from here on out will be of the realistic and cowardly nature for all countries. This is actually a good thing because that will make it less likely that a WWIII will break out.",

By cooperating with the Pakistani government along with the UN we would be able to go into Pakistan and take out the terror networks which attacked our troops. This would include Osama of course but also many other networks. Pakistan would as a result rid itself of some instabilities and the US and UN would have a better relationship because of their coordination responding to the brutal and unacceptable attack.",

If, for instance, Germany invaded France today chances are that Germany would get nuked and the invasion would fall apart. Same would be true with any major nuclear nation getting invaded today. Invasion can not realistically occur any longer because even if you think you can win an invasion you will always end up with less than you started with. They are pointless.

BUT, WWI involved mostly trenches, but WWII as you know, involved a lot of newer tactics like air raids, blitzkriegs, etc. Perhaps WWIII will involve nuclear weapons but many of the nuclear nations have signed a treaty which doesn't allow them to use nukes first (only after being nuked.) \n \n Please don't think of nuclear warheads as the only thing that matters. The use of any nuclear arsenal will cripple the sender's support around the world and will be affected morally and economically from Denouncements around the world. Nuclear weapons have only been used twice in battle, and they were way back when no countries have signed treaties or had any understanding of it's true power.",
