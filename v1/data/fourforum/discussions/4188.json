To do this he must have already possessed the Grand Unified Theory which is supposed to unite all the laws and forces of physics in one ultimate elegant equation. All natural phenomena from the most subtle quantum fluctuation to the most complex motions of the natural world were thus originated in his \"mind\" before the beginning of time.\n \n I once asked a priest if he ever thought about God in this way: he said he had to admit that when probed at the ultimate level, he was content to say that God is a divine \"mystery\". \n Once people retreat from questions raised in a rational enquiry by resorting to answers cloaked with \"mysteries\", I suspect they are on very weak ground.",
