   "I think what she did is not OK.\n \n She called him a XXXXXX. Literally. Then defended it by saying it a merely a schoolyard insult. Well, it sure is, and it started by making fun of fags. She didn't call him a generic insult like bonehead. It is a gay slur.\n \n I feel that most folks who use the term PC, use it as an reason to unjustifiably excuse offensive language. Some language is offensive and should be not used in civil discourse. Certainly some folks go overboard and are overly sensitive to word use to the point of absurdity. That does not mean there are no offensive terms. If someone called Christians \"cross-jockeys\", I think that is inappropriately offensive and I am not being PC.\n \n You two seem to think anti-gay insults are OK by the content of your remarks. (Calling Edwards pretty and having him use his purse.) Intimating that someone is gay and then implying that it is an insult simply means being gay is a bad thing and it worthy of scorn.\n \n I think Ann Coulter is seriously deranged and she has lost any ability to censor herself. Again, she claims that if one takes offense, it is because the listener is too sensitive or effete to handle her just plain folks tough talk. She is a truly vile human being who adds nothing to the public discourse. Articulate people do not need to talk like that.",
