If it were, poor people couldn't have the kids they do. Medical costs can be paid for by others. It's the luxuries many yuppy types seem to think they need that makes the after effects costly. \n In most cases of putting a pregnancy up for adoption, there is NO cost incurred to the mother.\n \n \nTo add to the obvious costs of pregnancy, there is also the loss of pay as I would not be able to work (I'm a geologist - this involves quite a bit of strenuous outdoors work), which would even further affect us.\n\n \n If putting the child up for adoption, this can be covered too.

Perpetuating ignorance if not outright deciet to justify a decision to abort.\n \n As for caring for the kid once they're here, that can be costly. More so for time. If you're poor, EIC and earned child tax credits and deductions help alleviate the child's cost (the gov't wants another generation of consumers and tax payers). You can get your liability to near 0 and have the gov't kick back some money. \n But, we're talking adoption.\n \n On top of these decisions, you also have consider the health risks fo carring the child to term OR the risks involved in getting an abortion. \n \n It's nice to think that you'll 'plan' a child later but, life seldom works that way. I'd hate to think that once you're finally ready to have a child, your uterus has been scarred to infertility or have sever complications in conception, carrying the child to term or delivery. I'd be ironic for another yuppy type who can't have children on their own due to an abortion to have to incure greater medical costs to have one or legal costs to adopt...and maybe even seeking a foreign child as there aren't any easily to be had here...since they were all aborted. Also, the older you get, the more health issues possible for the child.\n \n As for the intellectuals who wait to have birth later in life, watch Idiocracy starring Luke Wilson.

   "Another opinion", 
   "Though I haven't faced any such tough choices myself, I can hazard a guess about some of the reasons why women choose to abort instead of adopt:\n \n 1. Many, if not most women, don't feel that abortion in the first trimester (where the great majority of abortions happen) is that very wrong in the first place. They may feel uncomfortable about it but that may be a small consideration compared to the other factors involved. \n \n 2. Many women have very critical reasons for wanting to abort - ex. there is a serious threat to their life or health, they are victims of rape or incest, the fetus may be deformed, etc. - reasons that even many pro-life proponents agree with. These are reasons that might make it very difficult to carry a pregnancy at all.\n \n 3. There are serious reasons why a woman does not want to be a mother of that new child. Yes, in those situations, she would also have the option to adopt, so those are the situations that this question most addresses. So, what are some of the reasons she would choose abortion over adoption?\n \n a. Going through a pregnancy and birth can be a harsh ordeal. It certainly\n is not something that is easy to go through. \n \n b. Pregnancy can be expensive. If adopting parents cover those costs, \n then this reason is null.\n \n c. Most adoptions mean that the mother looses all track of her offspring. \n For most women, this would be very hard to take. Open adoptions would \n help in this situation.\n \n d. There is still somewhat of a negative stigma attached to a mother who \n adopts out her child. Yes, she may have the satisfaction of knowing \n that she benefited the adopting couple and probably gave her offspring \n a better life, but she will also probably often be asked and ask \n herself \"How could you have given up your own child? Your flesh and \n blood?\". From what I have heard, many adopting mothers feel a sense of \n guilt. Perhaps some major changes in societal perceptions could help \n this.\n \n e. Carrying a pregnancy in public when she is not going to keep the child\n shows to the world an embarrasing part of her life (i.e. getting pregnant \n accidentally) that can leave the woman open to a lot of societal criticism \n that she would prefer to avoid.",

Have you gone through a pregnancy? I talked with numerous friends who went through pregnancies, and the costs were astonishing - from the doctor visits, to the actual delivery which can cost well into the thousands (tens of thousands if there are difficulties with the birth). Just the visit I made shortly before getting an abortion was expensive. As for adoption, there very well may be no cost in the actual procedure- but there certainly are numerous costs - both monetarily and physically- before it. If you think otherwise, you are sadly mistaken.\n \n \n\n If putting the child up for adoption, this can be covered too. However, you havingto take time out per doctors instructions is something you might not desire as it could affect career opprotunities in certain lines of work.\n\n Yes, it certainly would affect my career opportunities, and that was one of the things I took into consideration (note that every thing I listed was something I considered).\n \n \n\n As an adoptive parent of 3 with decent knowledge of how 'the system' works, it's these annoying BS answers that tick me off. Perpetuating ignorance if not outright deciet to justify a decision to abort.\n\n \n As I have pointed out, the only BS here is your accusations.\n \n \n\n As for caring for the kid once they're here, that can be costly. More so for time. If you're poor, EIC and earned child tax credits and deductions help alleviate the child's cost (the gov't wants another generation of consumers and tax payers). You can get your liability to near 0 and have the gov't kick back some money. \n But, we're talking adoption. \n\n Yep, it certainly cann be quite expensive.\n \n \n\n On top of these decisions, you also have consider the health risks fo carring the child to term OR the risks involved in getting an abortion. \n\n Yes, I certainly did consider these risks, and the risks at the time were far higher for continuing pregnancy than getting an abortion.\n \n \n\n It's nice to think that you'll 'plan' a child later but, life seldom works that way. I'd hate to think that once you're finally ready to have a child, your uterus has been scarred to infertility or have sever complications in conception, carrying the child to term or delivery. I'd be ironic for another yuppy type who can't have children on their own due to an abortion to have to incure greater medical costs to have one or legal costs to adopt...and maybe even seeking a foreign child as there aren't any easily to be had here...since they were all aborted. Also, the older you get, the more health issues possible for the child.\n\n \n I'll have you know that the abortion went without a hitch, and my uterus is perfectly healthy, thankyouverymuch (not that it is any of your :xcensored business), and yes, I do plan to have a child in the future, and don't really care what you think about it.\n \n \n\n As for the intellectuals who wait to have birth later in life, watch Idiocracy starring Luke Wilson. Then smile as it IS the XXXXXX who are inheriting the world. But, what would you care? You won't be here...and most likely, neither will your decendents.\n \n \n If you want to kill it, then just kill it and say 'What's it too you?' or even 'Yeah, so I'm selfish and didn't want to take time out of my life to be bothered with details, bugger off ya wanker!' \n\n \n I'm not selfish, whether you or your buddy JP like to think so or not - I just look at actual reality rather than a fantasy world.\n \n \n As Another_opinion hinted, another factor is the fact that until around the end of the second trimester, I do not believe that a foetus is a person - something that made the choice to abort much easier for me than it is for some women whose religions have brainwashed them to worship the holy fertilized egg.",

So, what we're talking about is the killing of a human fetus because it would require some adjustments to one's life. That's part of the sacrifices that almost every parent in the world makes. In the specific instance discussed above, we weren't talking about anything more than the inconvenience of going through pregnancy and then giving the baby up for adoption. Now, I know that you're going to start in on how pregnancy is more than an inconvenience, yadda, yadda, yadda, but the fact remains that billions of women have given birth without issue and it is the exception, not the rule, that there are problems. Plus, the poster stated that she intends to have children in the future, so that argument is voided. \n \n As for your \"gestation or death\" comment. Don't you think that's a tad melodramatic?

   "Why do women opt for abortion over adoption?\n\n \n When contraception failed in my monogamous long term relationship, I heavily researched both options, as well as parenting. I looked into requirements for Medicaid, WIC, and other subsidized assistance offered in my community. I called a few clinics around town. That's an interesting story, but not for here.\n \n I had heart to heart talks to many different people with different viewpoints.\n \n I decided to have an abortion because I was sick all the time. I had diagnosed migraine headaches constantly, and my seizure disorder that had laid dormant for years returned. I couldn't leave my house. I lost my job. I was in the middle of my education (it was early summer) and if I continued my pregnancy it would have put me back a semester, thus costing thousands of dollars. The father did not want me to continue the pregnancy because he was concerned about my physical health.\n \n Just thinking about that time period makes me nauseated.\n \n I understood the merits of adoption, especially since my father was adopted. I talked to my aunt about adoption and foster care, since she has participated in both. I also thought about parenting, the love and all the things I have to offer. I knew that the father would have supported my decision to parent, I knew that our financial hardships could be dealt with, and I knew that my education could be continued later.\n \n I came to the conclusion that abortion was the best choice for me and my health. I appreciate that some may find this decision selfish, and essentially it is, since it was made with my best interests in mind. I would also hope that even if they consider it selfish, they understand the reasons why I made that decision.

You can argue the value or validity of those selfish reasons, but dems are da facts. \n\n However, your used the term \"selfish\" in suggesting that selfish reasons were not valid reasons. The great majority of decisions people make every day are selfish reasons - from decisions on career, to decisions whether to try to get pregnant at a particular time, to decisions on what food to eat - that does not make those decisions bad.\n \n As a comparison, people who use contraception do so because they want to enjoy the emotional and sensual pleasures of sex without the consequence of pregnancy. This includes the great majority of married couples as well. The sex acts which are for the main purpose of procreation are by far in the minority - for both married and single couples. Inherently, then, the great majority of sexual acts and use of contraceptives in those sexual acts are for technically selfish reasons. Does that make it wrong to have sex outside of reasons of procreation, or to use contraceptives when one does?\n \n I would suspect that you would not object to the selfish reasons that people have for using contraceptives because I would guess that you do not think of the use of contraceptives as being morally bad. However, I am assuming that you do view the selfish reasons that people have for aborting as being bad because you DO view abortion as being morally bad. \n \n The bottom line is that selfish reasons are only viewed as bad if they are used to support an immoral act. You have not proven that first trimester abortions constitute an immoral act.\n \nI do like your qualifier about first trimester abortions and its morality. It reminds me of the phrase \" a little bit pregnant\". :)\n\n Since you seem to value \"life\" as by far the most critical aspect of the embryo/fetus, I am not surprised that it makes no big moral difference for you if abortions are performed in the first trimester or the last. Pro-choice proponents do not see \"life\" as the most critical aspect but start placing more moral value on the fetus once other things come into play (ex. mental existence). In other words, we do see a big moral difference between aborting a zygote vs aborting a fetus one day from birth. Why? Because it is not merely \"life\" that we value but other things that come into play later on in a pregnancy.",

   "OK. Then they shouldn't get so indignant when people tell them that their actions are selfish.\n\n Whenever people choose not to sacrifice themselves for others, it can be considerered selfish. That does not mean that they have to make that sacrifice or that the lack of sacrifice is automatically bad and immoral. For example, there are a tremendous number of needy people in this world and most of us in this rich country (USA, or most Western countries) could probably sacrifice a lot more than we do in terms of our money and time to help those people out. Most of the reasons we would give for not giving most of our money or time to charity are ultimately selfish - mainly a reduction in our own lifestyles and needs. I doubt that you also give as much of your time or money as you could.\n \n The degree of \"badness\" of a selfish reason depends on what you are comparing to and what the expectations are. Nobody really expects people to give the great majority of their not-absolutely-essential money or time to charity and people who don't are not viewed as immoral despite the fact that the reasons they don't do so are selfish reasons. However, pro-life proponents like you view abortion instead of adoption as selfish because you have the expectation that the woman SHOULD sacrifice herself for that early fetus or embryo. \n \n I personally have not seen you make a good case as to why these women should have to sacrifice themselves for what, at that particular stage of their pregnancies, is only just a body with \"nobody home\". Unless you come up with good supported reasons, then I will continue to think that it should be her choice whether or not to make that sacrifice, not yours.\n \n Jitobear, ShadowPikachu, simone, ...\n If I can interject here, don't be so afraid of admitting that many of the reasons that women abort instead of adopting out are selfish. I am talking in general not specifically about your situations. Like I said to JPSartre12, a lot of the decisions we make in life are ultimately selfish - ex. not giving most of our non-absolutely-essential money or time to charity, not always giving money to potentially deserving beggars on the street, not being only give and no take in a relationship, etc. That doesn't make those decisions automatically bad. It would be a nice world if we were all altruistic but that is not reality. I don't think I have even met a fully altruistic person in my life. Selfishness is only bad if one is not fulfilling a universally acknowledged expectation or if the selfish reasons contradict one's own morality. I don't think that there are well supported reasons to expect that a woman pregnant with an unwanted embryo or early fetus HAS TO carry that pregnancy to term. Do you? If not, then why worry that someone is calling your reasons selfish. Simply because of different world views, you do not have the same expectations or view of responsibilities as they do. Their world view says that it is a responsibility of a pregnant woman to carry that pregnancy to term. Your world view does not.",

   "Simone:\n I'm not sure if I was the one you were addressing with these questions since you didn't specify. Since your post followed soon after mine, I will assume that it was. \n \n Anyway, any reasons which puts ones own interest ahead of others is a selfish reason. That doesn't make it bad. I think you automatically think \"selfish = bad\". I will restate that I view selfishness as bad only if one is not fulfilling a universally acknowledged expectation or if the selfish reasons contradict one's own morality. After all, is it bad not to give all of ones not-absolutely-necessary income to charity, not to give money to every beggar one walks past, not be all give and no take in a relationship? No, but most of the reasons behind our not being altruistic are ultimately selfish reasons. \n \n I think part of the problem is that many people automatically view \"selfish\" as being bad even though, if they examined their lives, they are being selfish all the time. We probably need a more specific word than \"selfish\".\n \n As for your specific questions:\n \nWhy is it selfish if a woman chooses to have an abortion so that her other children can have a better life?\n\n Many women do not wish to be mothers of a new child in order to keep the family size limited and give a better life to the other children. That is fine. The topic of this thread being adoption, she would also have the choice of adopting out the child and still leaving her family size and support unaffected (excluding health risks that limit her capabilities of mothering, etc.). Therefore, her choice not to adopt out may be based on other factors - some of which may be selfish factors in that they might have to do with burdens that she could potentially take on but that she doesn't want to. That doesn't make her decision bad. \n \nWhy is it selfish if woman chooses to have an abortion in order to advance in her career?\n\n Her choice is about herself over the potential baby - which is again ultimately a selfish choice because it concentrates on her needs. That doesn't make her choice bad unless one thinks that she is shirking a moral requirement to carry an unwanted pregnancy (as pro-life people do but which I do not since I do not view it necessary to have to sacrifice oneself for a fetus and early embryo which, at that point, is still only a body with no mind).\n \nWhy don't you ask if a man is being self if he chooses to ignore his wife and children in order to advance in his career?\n\n I think that action on the part of the man is selfish in a bad way, unless the wife and children are not emotionally negatively effected by his absence. He is hurting others (his wife and kids) in his decision when he doesn't have to.\n \n Either way, that last question had nothing to do with the abortion debate. There are probably millions of such questions one can ask of people that have nothing to do with the abortion debate. As to questions of whether selfish reasons are bad or ok where abortion is concerned, that depends on whether you think anyone is being hurt by an abortion and whether you think there is a moral requirement for a woman to carry her pregnancy to term. As I have already stated, I think that there is no moral requirement for a woman to carry her pregnancy to term, so I don't think that selfish reasons for stopping a pregnancy are immoral reasons. In other words, in that situation \"selfish\" does not equal \"bad\". Also, I don't think anybody is being hurt in early abortions - just a body that has the potential of becoming a person who can be hurt but is not one yet.",

Do you have the balls to ever ask if men are being selfish when they tromp all over everyone else in order to succeed?\n \n\n Sure do. Personally, I'd be much higher up in my organization if I put my job ahead of my family, but I refused to do so. Those that did, went further. And I have ZERO regrets because I have a great wife and three well-balanced adult children as a result of my conscious decision NOT to be selfish. emoticon_xgood \n \n\n Do you ever ask that question?\n\n All of the time.",

   "Thank you for your story and for supporting my belief that \"where there's a will, there's a way.\" emoticon_xgood \n\n \n But I don't believe that. I was 24, smart, resourceful, educated and had some good folks around me. I wasn't the 13 year old girl pregnant by her dad (with the mother's consent) my sister in law saw in her shelter. I wasn't (at the time) in a dangerous relationship. I had understanding profs - what if I didn't? What if that gal had not lied to the state? Women's lives are really complex. I don't believe there is always a way. I would like to change that. That is how I think we should tackle abortion. That is how I think it will work.\n \n \nI could see the mortgage part, but I'm a little fuzzy on the daycare for other kids part. How would being pregnant impact the fact that you already are paying for daycare? If anything, daycare costs would go to zero if you were forced to not work. emoticon_confused\n\n \n Fine - but there are other bills and my point stands.\n \n \nIt sounds like you are doing the responsible thing by insuring that you can't get pregnant again. I applaud that. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n Would like to see more women and men be careful.",

You and I rarely agree, but at least we can see the other's viewpoint. We may not agree which is more important, but at least we aren't so blind that we can't acknowledge its existence.\n For example, you see the risk to a woman's health (both physical and mental) as being much greater than I do. Why? Because our experiences have been dramatically different. I was intimately involved in all three of my wife's pregnancies. I went to the doctor with her, took LaMas(sp?) class, coached during delivery, even got to cut the ambilical cord on the last one. And throughout their growing years, I was always there and couldn't imagine NOT being there.\n As a result, I guess that I view childbirth and raising children differently from someone that had to struggle alone from pregnancy onward.",

However, Simone rarely provides any kind of logical argumentation. The others I see do provide logical argumentation but they also throw in the emotional rants. It is usually a debate technique intended to throw the opposition into a frenzy on emotional points that add nothing to the debate. It is specifically a technique used by experienced debators. Simone's arguments are almost exclusively of that nature. She will only occasionally avoid them and use logic and evidence to support her positions. Her reputation for providing decent argument is low in this regard.\n \n Yours is much better. Even in this post where you are clearly bothered, you approach it very level headed and without the hystrionics that frequently compose the posts of simone. You make a legitimate point and support it with reason and analysis. \n \n I am faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrr more willing to see your side of things and to listen to you with an open mind. Simone's posts have a tendancy to shut the door to my mind before I even read them.\n \n Others who say some of the vile things you referenced will typically turn me off once I read them, but I will usually push through the rest of the post so that I can read and evaluate that which does indeed have substance.\n \n Also, I don't read everything. Not enough time in the day. Simone I take notice of because I have had arguments around such rants and believe she has some really legitimate points and would like to see her use them far more constructively so that they are given some due weight.\n \n Huck",
