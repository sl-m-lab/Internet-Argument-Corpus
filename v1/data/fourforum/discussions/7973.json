The blacks in the room knew Mike to be anti-racist and more progressive than many other gay white men when it comes to representing the gay community's diversity. But was it OK for Mike, a young white guy, to make an analogy between the ban on gay marriage and the segregated public facilities of old, especially when most of our parents know what it was really like to not be able to try on clothes at segregated department stores?\n \n Mike's comparison wasn't the first time that white gay activists have invoked painful civil-rights imagery or compared their struggle with the black fight for rights a few decades ago. When 26-year-old New Paltz, N.Y., Mayor Jason West performed same-sex marriages last March, he called it \"the flowering of the largest civil-rights movement the country's had in a generation.\" San Francisco's 36-year-old mayor, Gavin Newsom, who allowed nearly 4,000 such marriages to take place in his city starting last February, said, \"Rosa Parks didn't wait for the courts to tell her it was all right to ride in the front of the bus.\" Last March, gaggles of white twentysomething gay kids stormed the Georgia State Capital building singing \"We Shall Overcome,\" an old Negro spiritual that served as the de facto rallying cry of the civil-rights struggle. And writing for The Advocate, C.E. Adams wondered, \"have gays just replaced blacks as the minority community that is openly discriminated against?\" \n \n The liberal use of comparisons, imagery, and symbols from the civil-rights movement of the 1950s and '60s in the gay-rights movement of the 2000s, vexes some blacks, especially older folks. It just doesn't equate for them. That's why many African-American old-timers who remember the turbulent days of racial apartheid in this country clasped their Bibles and gasped a collective gasp at seeing gay activists in Massachusetts holding up signs that read separate is not equal.\n http://www.citypaper.com/special/story.asp?id=7557&familyfilter=1\n \n\n \n Pot. Kettle. Black. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Then the reverse must also be true. If some gays want to (despite their cries for their private lives to be left alone) display their 'gay pride' in public - such as with Mardi Gras, then they should expect that Christians will, in the name of Christ, point out their sins - but Christians should also help gays over-come their sin.\n\n \n \n Ripskar is right it not only gay groups and people that christians have annoyed. There are many groups out there that want nothing to do with christianity and in this society, where all religions are equal or the practice of no religion, then the outspoken christian out to convert people through the law is going to P.O. people. That is what they don't understand. That someone attending a public high school football game shouldn't have to hear over the loud speaker \"Before the game let's all bow our heads and pray. Father we pray in Jesus name that you look upon the the students and those gathered and keep them safe. Amen\" You may seem to think there is nothing wrong with this but to the non christian or the non believer it is forcing them though to pray a christian prayer. Yes I have been to a Garland Texas public high school football game in 1993 and I have heard these words comming out of the loudspeaker. It should have been a moment of silence.",

   "I am a throw the baby out with the bath water kind of person.\n Well I am gay first. They are at war against gay people so my loyalties lie to being gay first. I believe that religion is a very very private matter. Religion has gotten millions of people killed in the past. Taking all these things together if religion is the problem then it needs to go. The teachings of Jesus need not be taught or shared in a church. Jesus wasn't even christian and never set foot in a christian church. It is a lot like termite infestation of your house you don't notice them if they stay in the basement or some out of the way location in the yard. It is when the termites are eating your roof, walls, and, foundation that they become a problem. Do you call an exterminator or do you just live with the problem. Yes I know the irony of my last few sentances, since the annology that I used is exactly how christyians view gay people. They do view us as termites that are eating at their foundations.\n\n \n Im sorry if you think that we think you are termites, first and foremost i see you as my brother, yes you have sinned, but hell so have I. I think it interesting that you mention that Jesus wasn't a christion, you are exactly right. He was a Jew, or at least his form as a man was a Jew. He is also the God of the universe, and he in the end will judge all people. This brings me to my next point: it would be a sad world where nobody had a religion, because that would mean everyone had turned from God and would be isolated from anything good and right for eternity. Let me refrase, it would be great if nobody had a religion and everyone trusted in Jesus, because I am not part of a religion I am part of a family with God as my father and Jesus as my brother. Its as rediculous calling true christianity a religion as it would be if I called my famly the Taylor Religion. God bless you.",

   "Choose Whom You Will Serve \n By Mario Bergner - (An Ex-Gay Testimonial)\n \n I lay on the hospital bed, feeling empty and afraid. My health over the previous thirteen months had drastically declined. From the first venereal disease in January 1982 to my admission now (February 1983) with thrush, I'd had 12 frightening symptoms. In my mind these events occurring within two years after I had become sexually active pointed in one direction - AIDS. \n \n That evening while lying on my bed, I gently rubbed the cross that hung around my neck. \"Jesus,\" I prayed, \"what have I done? I sought You out at age 14 and again at 18, but neither time did I receive the healing to be free of homosexuality. Why, Lord?\" \n \n No answer came. But a vision did. Startled, I watched two scenes playing simultaneously on screens suspended in midair. The screen on the left showed me in a hospital room as a homosexual being treated for AIDS. The screen on the right showed the outline of the Lord's head and shoulders with a great light shining from behind Him. Then the Spirit of the Lord said, \"I want to heal your whole person, not just your body. Choose.\" I chose the screen showing the Lord. The room filled with the presence of God. I was speechless. \n \n Early the next morning, a nurse came in and took one final blood test before a scheduled bone marrow biopsy. A few hours went by. Then my doctor came into my room. Perplexed, he told me that this last blood test had revealed an increase in white blood cells. As a result, he was postponing the biopsy. After another five days, I was released. By my follow-up visit one week later, I had returned to work. \n \n When I chose life during that vision in the hospital, God healed me of my physical illness. Yet I did not fully know I had embarked on a road that eventually would lead me to forsake homosexuality.\n \n When I first came to Christ at age 14, I was overcome with joy. Sometime during that year, I came across the word homosexual in a magazine. Now I had a name for the sexual feelings surging within me. \n \n In the fall of 1977, I entered the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee. One of my professors was openly homosexual and also very affirming of my acting talents. \n \n Then, at age 21, I moved to New York City after passing the acting audition for admittance to a theater program. I came fully \"out of the closet\" and began openly to acknowledge myself as \"gay.\" I experienced a sense of freedom I had never known. \n \n And I found that my gay professor from the University of Wisconsin had also moved to New York City. My friendship with him and his lover grew, and they become my mentors. Oddly enough, I received from them the nurturing and affirmation I had always needed from my father.\n \n Then I moved to Boston and began socializing regularly at gay bars. Sexual activity and drug and alcohol use, which a few years earlier I would never have considered, became part of my life. \n \n One autumn evening, I walked with a lesbian friend through the tree-lined streets of Cambridge. As we approached a church, we heard a black gospel choir belting out a song about the blood of Jesus. The music was mesmerizing; we stopped and listened. The presence of Jesus filled that little church. I was near tears. It had been many years since I had felt God's presence. \n \n By October of 1982, the harsh realities of the gay lifestyle were becoming apparent to me. My initial sense of relief at coming out of the closet had worn away. During this time, thoughts of my Christian past filled me with pain. \n \n I felt increasingly hopeless and depressed. I still believed that Jesus was God, and felt troubled with guilt for not living according to Christian standards. \n \n One night while coming home from a gay bar, I cried out to God. \"I would be better off if You just left me alone.\" Then a verse from the Bible popped into my head: \"Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you\" (Heb. 13:5). \n \n Stubbornly I said to God, \"I'm leaving You in this stairwell\" and entered the hallway leading to my apartment. Suddenly my eyes were opened to see hundreds of demons charging toward me. Terrified, I raced back to the stairwell and said, \"I didn't mean it, Lord. I don't want to leave You; suffering with You is better than the alternatives to suffering without You.\" \n \n I peeked back into the hallway. Seeing nothing, I cautiously walked to my apartment and locked the door behind me, went to bed, and tried to forget what had happened.\n \n Another night I was in a gay bar, sipping a drink. Suddenly I heard a voice say, \"You will help Me deliver these people.\" I quickly looked around, but nobody was behind me. Promptly, I ordered another vodka martini. I left the main bar and walked across the crowded dance floor, sitting next to a large speaker. With my ears pounding with music, I heard the voice again, even more clear: \"You WILL HELP ME DELIVER THESE PEOPLE.\" I knew this was the voice of God, and fear gripped my heart. \n \n In the coming months, God continued patiently arranging the circumstances of my life to show me the consequences of my lifestyle. As each symptom of AIDS appeared, my fear and hopelessness increased. Then came the vision in Boston City Hospital, when I took hold of His hand and began walking out of darkness into His incredible light. \n \n After my release from hospital, I telephoned my sister Annelyse and told her about my physical healing. She was in the midst of taking an adult class at her church taught by Leanne Payne, and mailed me a copy of Leanne's book, The Broken Image. I resisted believing the healings documented in the book, still not ready to leave homosexuality. \n \n Then I moved to Ohio for a teaching job. I had little opportunity to meet other gay people and became lonely and depressed. I began to realize that God was asking me to choose between Himself and homosexuality. For the first time, I seriously considered the possibility that homosexuality could be reversed through faith in Jesus Christ.\n \n As winter break approached, my sister called me and invited me to a Leanne Payne class. Afterward, I could no longer deny God. If He wanted to change my homosexual orientation, I was willing to let Him. I agreed to do whatever He asked, and I was honest before God. \n \n Then I visited a church near home. When the preacher gave the altar call for anyone who needed to be reconciled to God, I went forward. An associate pastor came to my side and whispered, \"Do you know that your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life?\" \n \n My body was trembling. \"No, I've committed too many sins.\" \n \n \"That doesn't matter; just repent of those sins.\"\n \n With tears of sorrow pouring from my eyes, I repented of all my sins, including homosexuality. Then the elders prayed for me to be filled with God's presence. Like a great rush of wind from Heaven, the Holy Spirit descended into the depth of my being. All the fears and dread lodged in my gut left, and tears of joy flowed from my eyes. God's great healing work in me had begun. \n \n As long as I considered healing a possibility, I agreed before God not to engage in homosexual activity. After repenting of lust, I threw away every piece of pornography I owned. And in the midst of temptation, I learned to ask myself, What is it about this man that I am trying to take? What part of my masculinity does he symbolize that I am not in touch with?\n \n One Friday, classes were canceled. It would be two full days before Sunday morning when I could fellowship with other Christians. I felt lonely, and knew that if I left my apartment, I would surely have a sexual fall. \n \n That morning during my devotions, I heard God say, \"I love you, Mario.\" I knew if I could make it until Sunday morning without falling, my body would never again be devoured with homosexual temptation like this. I placed a band-aid plastic strip over the inside of my front door and the molding around it. Then I promised God I would not break that seal until Sunday morning. \n \n For the next two days, temptation and anxiety raged. But I kept my vow. With Christ, I faced the loneliness, anxiety, sexual temptation and abandonment I never before could face. It was a turning point. The next week I came into a powerful new realization of Christ living in me. It's a reality that continues to impact my life every day. \n \n http://www.exodus-international.org/testimonials_left_homosexuality_05.shtml",

I have spent FOUR years contrasting the actions of this man to those of my former Christian brethren. He has found time and loved a child that was not his own - helps with homework, plays sports, comes to all his games, takes him to play pool, bowling, movies, fishing, and to volunteer. Teaches him about cars and fixing things. He helps me with chores, when my car breaks down. He is loving, kind, generous, patient, honest, dedicated, loyal, and has become one the very few people on this planet I trust implicitly.\n\n \n I'm happy for you and I'm happy for your son.

   "Was The United States Was Founded As A Heathen Nation That Disowned God? \n \n The depraved minds that engineered the diabolical scheme to have the motto IN GOD WE TRUST placed on the nation's coins despised the noble Christian gentlemen who established our system of government and adopted the Bill of Rights. These evil religious perverts considered great men like the wise and heroic James Madison to be heathens who disowned God. These despicable minions of the horned one were successful largely because the Counterfeit Christians outnumbered the Genuine Christians during and just after the Civil War. \n \n Reverend M.R. Watkinson - who was part of a larger campaign waged by Counterfeit Christian's who were disenchanted with the exemption of religion from the cognizance of government, so wisely established by the founders, and determined to overthrow the Separation of Church and State - wrote a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Samuel P. Chase in 1861 urging that the United States recognize the Deity on United States coins. Secretary Chase openly advocated government authority over religion and was of course receptive to the satanic inspired appeals from Watkins and other Counterfeit Christians throughout the country. Rev. Watkinson's letter dated November 13, 1861 reads a follows:\n  Dear Sir: \n \n You are about to submit your annual report to the Congress respecting the affairs of the national finances. One fact touching our currency has hitherto been seriously overlooked. \n \n I mean the recognition of the Almighty God in some form on our coins.\n \n You are probably a Christian. What if our Republic were not shattered beyond reconstruction? Would not the antiquaries of succeeding centuries rightly reason from our past that we were a heathen nation? (Editorial Comment: He just accused the noble men who established our system of government of being heathens) \n \n What I propose is that instead of the goddess of liberty (Editorial Comment: His goal is to rub out a piece of the national heritage) we shall have next inside the 13 stars a ring inscribed with the words PERPETUAL UNION; within the ring the allseeing eye, crowned with a halo; beneath this eye the American flag, bearing in its field stars equal to the number of the States united; in the folds of the bars the words GOD, LIBERTY, LAW.\n \n This would make a beautiful coin, to which no possible citizen could object. ( Editorial Comment: Was there no Col. Johnson in 1860 to rise and admonish the people that the rights of conscience cannot be so successfully assailed as under the pretext of holiness)\n \n This would relieve us from the ignominy of heathenism. ( Editorial Comment: He again charges the founding fathers of heathenism) This would place us openly under the Divine protection we have personally claimed. From my hearth I have felt our national shame in disowning God ( Editorial Comment: This evil pervert distorts Christ's command not to render to Caesar what belongs to God into a disowning of God) as not the least of our present national disasters.\n \n To you first I address a subject that must be agitated.\n The United States was deprived of any right to claim it was a genuine Christian Nation when the American people did not take up the terrible swift sword and extirpate the wicked government stooges who passed the 1860's bill that authorized the government to declare the people's trust in God on the nation's coins. The people might just as well have sworn allegiance to the Devil and began attending worship at the Temple of Satan.\n \n FVF",

In a secular nation , were all views are equal, then my views are just as valid as yours. \n\n Not true by a longshot. Views contrary to public morality aren't viewed as equal. Nobody weighs a pedophile's views on par with someone who isn't a pervert, for example, so your argument is baseless because your premise is flawed.\n \n\n BTW why do you think that these religious nuts want these constitutional amendments passed? It is because in the eyes of the law marriage isn't defined either way legally. They are the ones who want to leaglly define marriage.\n \n\n Wrong, legal marriage is defined as a man and a woman. It was reinforced in 1996 by the DOMA. The problem is that many people fear an activist SCOTUS would attempt to undermine the will of the people. A Constitutional Amendment would make the law SCOTUS-proof. It's a sad commentary that we can't even trust the Supreme Court to not act as a superlegislature, but Griswold v Conn and Roe v Wade proved otherwise. \n \n\n I have one sentence. \"lord Jesus please save me from your followers\" since I do not actully see Jesus on the pulpit then one can only assume that what people are fighting is the christian preachers and sudrys interpatations of what the christian preachers and sundy think Jesus is teaching.

   "The Puritans Declared War On Christmas\n \n The residents of early New England were strongly influenced by the traditions of Calvinism and the routine of the established Congregational church, honoring hard work and stern independence, which were interpreted as self-sufficiency. They were proud of observing Thanksgiving as the most important day of the year and self-righteous in refusing to observe Christmas day, which they considered an emblem of the Roman Catholic Church. The Presbyterians, Quakers and Baptists also followed the teachings of John Calvin and chose not to celebrate Christmas.

   "How about simply continuing doing what we've pretty much been doing all along already (rather than your idea of ony one specific religion), and use principles they all have in common for our laws? After all, there's not a one that doesn't go along with the basic principles we have in law, like not murdering, stealing, or harming others. Do you really think it's just a coincidence that ourt laws happen to reflect those basic religious tenets? If you do, would you be interested in buying some swamp land? emoticon_xangel\n \n Law has never really been only secular, because people are mostly religious. It may not raise one religion over another, or even raise religion over atheism, but there's no distinction in law by which it self-claims to be secular. The \"secular\" moniker is nothing more than an adjective that people apply to it who wish there were no religious influences on law whatsoever. There's nothing official about it. As long as people continue to be religious, religion will continue to influence they way they govern themselves, even if only indirectly. Get used to it.\nIt happens that outlawing murder, theft or assault and battery are secular laws, pretty much held in common by every society.

   "Why Presidential Religious Recommendations During \n Early Years Of Republic Are Not Legitimate Legal Precedent\n \n \n Those who reject the exclusive and absolute authority of Christ over religion and foolishly advocate government authority over the duty which we owe to our Creator, frequently cite the joint resolution passed by Congress in 1789, requesting President George Washington to issue religious advice to the American people, as legal precedent for general government advisory authority over religion, including the recommendation that the people obey the Ten Commandments. However, a close examination of the historical evidence reveals that Congress believed that the joint resolution was illegal and had no intent to establish a legal precedent or to assume the authority to issue religious advice to the people. \n \n The proposal to pass the 1789 resolution was advanced in the House of Representatives just a few days before the end of the first session of the First U. S. Congress. It was contested on legal grounds that it was a religious matter and as such was excluded from Congressional authority, and on moral grounds that it mimicked European customs which made a mockery of thanksgivings. Interestingly, the supporters of the proposal did not even argue that the new U. S. Constitution granted Congress the authority to pass such a resolution. Instead, they argued that the resolution was justified by the rejoicings and thanksgiving rendered upon the completion of Solomon's Temple in 956 B. C., and the practice of the Continental Congress. \n \n The most reasonable conclusion, based on the legislative history, is that Congress believed it had no power under the Constitution to pass the resolution; however, a trivial deviation from strict Constitutional principles was warranted by the extraordinary occasion of the peaceful establishment of a new system of national government. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the First U. S. Congress did not pass similar resolution the next year. The conclusion and its confirmation are further bolstered by the fact that Congress would not pass another joint resolution of a religious nature for twenty-four years. Congress clearly did believe that issuing religious recommendations to the people was consistent with the principles of the Constitution.\n \n President George Washington proved he was not a genuine Christian (one who acknowledges the exclusive authority of Christ over the duty which we owe to the Creator) when he abused his civil authority by the corruption of religion for political purposes. He issued a foolish recommendation, without even a joint resolution from Congress, on January 1, 1795 recommending that the people pray and give thanks for \"the suppression of the late insurrection\" in Pennsylvania. (The \"Whiskey Rebellion\") John Adams also proved to be a Counterfeit Christian by issuing two blatantly politically influenced religious recommendations, in four years, without a joint resolution from Congress.\n \n President Thomas Jefferson respected the authority of God and flatly refused to issue religious recommendations during his eight years in office. An experiment with religious proclamations during the War of 1812 by Congress and President Madison backfired when \"the language of scripture itself was employed by divines in their sermons, and by magistrates in their proclamations, to point political sarcasm and to rekindle political rage.\" \n \n Congress learned a lesson from the experiments during the War of 1812. It never passed another joint resolution asking the President to issue religious advice to the people. \n \n An attempt by Henry Clay in 1828 to pass a joint resolution asking President Andrew Jackson to issue a recommendation to fast passed in the Senate. It was the subject of a lively debate in the House; but it died on the table with out a final vote. \n \n Saint George Tucker, as professor of law at the College of William and Mary and the exponent of Jeffersonian republicanism, in 1803 published the first extended, systematic commentary on the United States Constitution after its ratification and later its amendment by the Bill of Rights. On the question of religious recommendations, Tucker wrote: \"The proclamation of the two former presidents recommending fasting and prayer, were of this nature; they were an assumption of power not warranted by the constitution, or rather prohibited, by the true spirit of the third article of amendments.\" See Saint George Tucker; Blackstone's Commentaries; Volume 1,Appendix, Note D, Section 15-- Executive Powers-- Footnote No. 303. Published in 1803. http://www.constitution.org/tb/t1d15000.htm\n \n Summary and Conclusion\n \n The 1789 joint resolution of Congress for an executive recommendation of prayer and thanksgiving cannot be accepted as a legitimate legal precedent for anything other than to justify a deviation from Constitutional principles in the event this nation ever peacefully adopts another system of national government. There is no provision in the Constitution that grants Congress the authority to pass a joint resolution for an executive religious recommendation; there is no provision in the Constitution that grants the President the authority to issue an executive religious recommendation; the First U. S. Congress never claimed that the 1789 resolution was Constitutional, the proponents of the resolution never argued that it was Constitutional, the First Congress did not pass another religious resolution the next year; Congress did not pass another religious resolution for almost a quarter of a century; only eight such resolutions were passed during the first twenty-four years of the Republic; no religious resolutions were passed by Congress for at least the next one hundred years; James Madison believed religious resolutions made \"no part of the trust delegated to political rulers\"; Saint George Tucker was of the opinion that religious proclamations were not warranted by the constitution, or rather prohibited, by the First Amendment; and James Madison's view of religious freedom, and his interpretation of the First Amendment eventually prevailed during the Early Years of the Republic on every issue involving the interpretation of the religion clauses.\n \n Fred",

These were ideas bigger than the man who would break the ice for them, ideas that would later confound the man who took the Anglo-Saxon stiff upper lip and curled it forever. He was \"Elvis the Pelvis,\" with one hand on the blues terminal and the other on the gospel, which is the essence of rock & roll, a lightning flash running along his spine, electroshock therapy for a generation about to refuse numbness, both male and female, black and white.\n \n The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Creedence Clearwater Revival were all introduced to the blues through Elvis.

   "ALEXANDER THE GREAT - Intimate Companions\n Throughout his life Alexander had a number of close relationships which were of tremendous importance to him. In his elevated and often highly dangerous position it was vital to have a small group of people on whom he could rely completely. His lovers were both female and male at a time when his bisexuality was not at all unusual in the ancient world.\n \n Within Greek society bisexuality amongst men was standard behaviour, and with wives to produce children and prostitutes to provide recreational sex, their finer feelings were reserved for their male lovers. Xenophon had written that homosexuality was simply a part of education, and Aristotle held the conventional Greek view that men's most important relationships, platonic or otherwise, should be with other men. Homosexuality then had few of the connotations of weakness, and many of the great warriors Alexander so admired had lifelong male partners. The unmatched Theban Band was made up exclusively of male couples who would fight to the death for each other, and of course the love felt by Alexander's great role model, Achilles, for his companion Patroclus reflected the feelings Alexander had for his own lifelong companion Hephaistion. \n \n Although there is no direct evidence that their relationship was sexual, the couple's visit to the Trojan graves of the two heroes served to underline the nature of their own relationship. Later gossip would also state that Alexander was only defeated once, and that was by Hephaistion's thighs.\n \n http://www.alanfildes.com/intimatecompanions.php\n \n And, from Wikipedia:\n \n Alexander's greatest emotional attachment is generally considered to have been to his companion, cavalry commander (chiliarchos) and childhood friend, Hephaestion. He studied with Alexander, as did a handful of other children of Macedonian aristocracy, under the tutelage of Aristotle. Hephaestion makes his appearance in history at the point when Alexander reaches Troy. There the two friends made sacrifices at the shrines of the two heroes (who at that time in history were widely regarded as lovers)[1] Achilles and Patroclus; Alexander honoring Achilles, and Hephaestion honoring Patroclus. As Aelian in his Varia Historia (12.7) claims, \"He thus intimated that he was the object of Alexander's love, as Patroclus was of Achilles.\" Following Hephaestion's death, Alexander mourned him greatly, and did not eat for days. . . .Many historians report that Alexander also had a favorite, \"Bagoas, a eunuch exceptional in beauty and in the very flower of boyhood, with whom Darius was intimate and with whom Alexander would later be intimate,\" (Curtius, VI.5.23). Bagoas is the only one who is actually named as the eromenos - the beloved - of Alexander. Their relationship seems to have been well known among the troops, as Plutarch recounts an episode (also mentioned by Dicaearchus) during some festivities on the way back from India) in which his men clamor for him to openly kiss the young man: \"Bagoas [...] sat down close by him, which so pleased the Macedonians, that they made loud acclamations for him to kiss Bagoas, and never stopped clapping their hands and shouting till Alexander put his arms round him and kissed him.\" Whatever Alexander's relationship with Bagoas, it was no impediment to relations with his queen: six months after Alexander's death Roxana gave birth to his son and heir, Alexander IV.\n \n Some contest historical accounts describing Alexander's love for Hephaestion and Bagoas as sexual, claiming they were written centuries after the fact and thus are necessarily inaccurate. Others retort that the same can be said about much of our information regarding Alexander. Such debates, however, are generally considered anachronistic by scholars of the period, who point out that the concept of homosexuality as understood today did not exist in Greco-Roman antiquity. Sexual attraction between males was seen as a normal and universal part of human nature since it was believed that men were attracted to beauty, an attribute of the young, regardless of gender. If Alexander's love life was transgressive, it was not for his love of beautiful youths but for his persistent love of a man his own age. . . .\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_great#Alexander.27s_marriages_and_sexuality",

There is plenty of evidence that not all the 'kingly' figures were what we would consider 'straight males' by todays standards.

No matter how JP trys to distract from that point, those facts are rather inconviently in his face. \n \n Now, he can \"believe what every his heart desires\".

   "I rather think it was the thing in those days to have a harem, if one were a king or very rich, Macedonian or not.\n \n By the by, the book The Persian Boy by Mary Renault is an interesting fictional read on the life of Alexander.\n \n From Wikipedia:\n \nThe Persian Boy is a historical novel written by Mary Renault and narrated by Bagoas, a young Persian from an aristocratic family who is captured by his father's enemies, castrated, and sold as a slave to the king Darius III, who makes him his favorite. Eventually he becomes the lover and most faithful servant of Alexander the Great, who overthrew Darius and captured the Persian Empire. Bagoas' narration provides both a Persian view of the conquest and an intimate look at the personality of the conqueror.\n \n Like much of Renault's fiction, the book, published in 1972, also provides a sympathetic portrait of homosexual love. The Persian Boy is notable for its depiction of the tradition of pederasty in ancient Greece, where relationships between adult men and adolescent boys were celebrated. In the novel, Bagoas is 15 years old when he begins his relationship with Alexander (then about 26). Renault depicts the attachment as lasting until Alexander's death, when Bagoas would have been about 22.\n \n The book describes the major incidents of Alexander's later career, such as his abortive invasions of present-day Afghanistan and India, his marriage to Roxane, his crossing of the Gedrosian Desert, the death of Hephaistion and his own final illness and death.\n \n Bagoas was a historical figure, identified by the Roman historian Curtius as \"a eunuch exceptional in beauty and in the very flower of boyhood, with whom Darius was intimate and with whom Alexander would later be intimate.\" Plutarch described Alexander's troops, seeing their leader sitting with the boy, as \"clapping their hands and shouting till Alexander put his arms round him and kissed him.\" From these and a few other fragments, Renault creates an imaginative portrait of a lover and confidant to Alexander.\nI must confess I first read the book when I was in my twenties or thirties and I didn't understand it and I couldn't grasp the point of the book. I was soooooooooooo naive. I reread it recently with far more understanding and I am inclined to think that it is a reasonable representation of those times.",
