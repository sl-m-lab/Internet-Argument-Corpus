He was asking for complete obedience and whatnot. \n I suppose you could say the same here if you worded it correctly, but I'll not worry about that now. \n I just think maybe we should give some sign of thanks for living here. Oh, and for being able to go to school (more aimed towards the girls). oh, and to express yourself in class (to a point). Not to mention at least kind of choose your own career. What harm is 30 seconds of a pledge? Then again, whether you take it serioulsy or not is a different matter.\n \n As for football fanatics? jeez. I'm not sure.

   "Well, this can be construed in many ways. But I firmly believe that the god he - the author - was referencing is indubitably the Christian god. \n Last time I checked, Francis Bellamy was not a Moslem or a follower of any other monotheistic religion, and though the Declaration states we are a nation of free religion, it was - and still is, in some cases - extremely biased. You may also realize it implies \"all men are created equal\", but at the same time blacks were being enslaved because of their preordained path as subservient people. \n For the Pledge, I interpreted it as being the Christian God because the writer of the constitution was a Baptist minister, or so I believe.\n \n *EDIT* Just did some research to verify this and the abridged version was thanks to Mr. Eisenhower. He added the \"under God\" part, so I guess that's irrelevant to my whole argument.\n\n \n Appreciate the edit. Good info. I gues the question at this time would be, Why can it NOT be other gods. So what if it was originally intended to be the christian God? We have the ability as a free country to make it mean so much more than that. The statement under God has two purposes other than the acknowledgement of a supreme being. 1) It promotes that as a fundamental belief of the people of this country that we are a moral people. 2) It promotes the fundamental belief of the people of this country that we are not perfect and that only by diligence and attentiveness can our freedoms ever be maintained.",

You can choose if you want to or don't want to say the \"under God\" line, and if people don't like it, that's too fvcking bad!!! A bunch of XXXXXX are bringing it up again, cause they don't have anything better to do than be XXXXXX.\n \n Now, I know that none of our troops needed to die for any war or conflict, since WWII... especially over 40 Thousand of our troops died for nothing in Nam, but what I've NEVER heard ANYONE say about WWII, was that our troops died in that war for nothinig... not to say that, no stupid decisions were made during the war, or friendly fire deaths didn't happen, during WWII,\n but I've never heard ANY Vet of WWII say our troops died for nothing in WWII.\n \n If there ever was a just, righteous and necessary war for the U.S. to fight in,\n it was WWII. \n \n Sure, everyone could have paid attention to what was happening in Germany before the war, with the arms buildup, and unloaded on the Germans then, but\n I've never heard any WWII Vet say WWII was not a just, righteous and necessary war for the U.S. to fight in, or that our troops died for nothing when they went to fight in that war.\n \n I'd sure like to know where you heard a remark like that about WWI, because I watched lots of interviews with WWII Vets, and lots about WWII for the past 40+ years, and I've talked with lots of WWII Vets too.\n \n One thing I never heard any WWII Vet or any American even suggest or say was that WWII was not a war that we did have to send our troops into.\n \n Again, if you're talking about blunders, and bad decisions, like Pearl Harbor, or\n stupid strategic decisions that got lots of troops killed for little gain, during WWII... Sure that happened, and it is bound to happen in all wars.\n \n However, if you are talking about The Second World War. I have never heard any such remark from any Vet, as you say you have, and frankly, I am not inclined to believe you about it. (Yes. I know that vets of other wars since WWII have said that the troops in those wars and conflicts died for nothing, and I agree with them, and believe that, but not the thing about WWII. You will have to come up with something to support that statement, if you expect anyone to take it seriously.)\n \n Sadly, the fact is that we have, and continue to send our troops to die for absolutely no good reason, and we are keeping our troops in harms way, and they are being killed for nothing as we speak. And that is a slap in the face of the families of the dead soldiers that were sent to die half way around the world for nothing, as has too often been the case.\n \n Which is why I won't support any Presidential Candidate or President that keeps our troops in Iraq, and doesn't begin an immediate withdrawal.

I am a Christian, a patriot, and pro-choice (and I dont mean I support abortion). I am an Independant who leads towards the right. I do not \"blindly follow\" others. For instance, Christianity. I am a devout Baptist. I do not automatically accept the preacher's message as gospel. You must first compare it to the Book he is supposedly teaching from, the Bible. The reason I am is a Baptist, is because it openly encourages reading the Bible for yourself. Unlike Catholocism, which puts religious leaders in the pulpits reading out a Bible, to a crowd largely without Bibles, who draw Gospel from the speaker's words. No, the Baptist philosophy includes reading the Holy Book for yourself, so you can see for yourself, in black and white, the truth.\n \n About Patriots. What have you against them? If it wasn't for Patriots there wouldn't even be an America, and I highly doubt you would have the level of freedom you now enjoy. Patriots have sacrificed their lives for generations to keep their rights, and for love of country. And yes, love of country is necessary. I love my country and I would like to think I would give my life for my country, if called to. Love of country unites people and helps keep politicians in check.\n \n I am also Pro-Choice, and no I am not saying I am for abortion. I am for being able to choose whether or not you want to own a weapon. The Second Amendment protects my right to own a firearm, and I will never give up my personal safety for any reason. Europe has outlaws the individual ownership of firearms, and their crime rate has sharply increase. Their was also a study done, in which an entire neighborhood put signs in their yards, proudly claiming to be gun free homes. These homes were more prone to criminal activity, i.e. break-ins and robberys, than a normal home, with no sign. If you ban firearms, you take away the right of the average American to protect themselves. The criminals already obtain their weapons illegaly, so what will change? They will still illegally obtain their firearms, and use them illegaly. While American citizens will lose their ability to protect themselves.\n \n Now I know this has nothing to do with the topic, but I HAD to respond to this comment.",

I thought that was funny) \n \n The same thing goes for the French Revolution... I didn't even know that was a democracy! (it wasn't a democracy for the aristocrats, anyhow) Now I understand why the French gave the US the Statue of Liberty. (I thought they were allies only because they both hated Great Britain!) Come to think of it, Britain's King signed the Magna Carta before the French Revolution or the American Republic. So Britain's peaceful drift to democracy has probably had a lot of influence as well. I do think that the US has had the greatest influence... it has been the most successful country over the past century or two. \n \n p.s. Is this: http://www.infokey.com/hon/magna.htm , not the most interesting history of the Magna Carta and the infamous King John you've ever read? I love it!",

   "Its true that the Greeks were the first, but that was a long time ago. As far as I know, there have been no major democracies between their time and the U.S. (early Rome?) I didn't know about the Six Nations democracy at all, or that the U.S. copied it. I have heard that the Founding Fathers studied the Roman Republic extensively. What I'm saying is that the influence of the extremely successful American country has had a major part in the spread of democracy in present times.\n\n \n Definatly. Ecpessially liberal democracy.",

   "I don't believe in Santa Claus, but I'm not going to sue somebody for singing a* Ho-Ho-Ho song in December. \n \n I don't agree with Darwin, but I didn't go out and hire a lawyer when my high school teacher taught his* theory of evolution. \n \n Life, liberty or your pursuit of happiness will not be endangered because someone says* a 30-second prayer before a football game. So what's the big deal? It's not like* somebody is up there reading the entire book of Acts. They're just talking to a* God they believe in and asking him to grant safety to the players on the field* and the fans going home from the game. \"But it's a Christian prayer,\" some will* argue. Yes, and this is the United States of America, a* country founded on Christian principles. And we are in the Bible Belt. According* to our very own phone book, Christian churches outnumber all others better than* 200-to-1. So what would you expect-somebody chanting Hare* Krishna?* \n \n If I went to a football game in Jerusalem, I* would expect to hear a Jewish prayer. \n \n If I went to a soccer game in Baghdad, I* would expect to hear a Muslim prayer. \n \n If I went to a ping pong match in China, I* would expect to hear someone pray to Buddha. \n \n And I wouldn't be offended. It wouldn't bother me one bit. When in* Rome... \n \n \"But what about the atheists?\" is another argument. What about them? Nobody is asking* them to be baptized. We're not going to pass the collection plate. Just humor us* for 30 seconds. If that's asking too much, bring a Walkman or a pair of ear* plugs. Go to the bathroom. Visit the concession stand. Call your lawyer.* Unfortunately, one or two will make that call. One or two will tell thousands* what they can and cannot do. I don't think a short prayer at a football game is* going to shake the world's foundations. \n \n Christians are just sick and tired of turning the other cheek while our courts strip us of* all our rights. Our parents and grandparents taught us to pray before eating, to* pray before we go to sleep. Our Bible tells us just to pray without ceasing. Now* a handful of people and their lawyers are telling us to cease praying. God, help* us. And if that last sentence offends you, well..........just sue* me..* \n \n The silent majority has been silent too long.. it's time we let that one or two who* scream loud enough to be heard, that the vast majority don't care what they* want.. it is time the majority rules! \n \n It's time we tell them, you don't have to pray.. you don't have to say the pledge of* allegiance, you don't have to believe in God or attend services that honor Him.* That is your right, and we will honor your right.. but by golly you are no* longer going to take our rights away .. we are fighting back.. and we WILL WIN!* After all the God you have the right to denounce is on our* side!* \n \n God bless us one and all, especially those who denounce* Him...* \n \n God bless America, despite all her faults.. still the greatest nation of* all.....* \n \n God bless our service men who are fighting to protect our right to pray and worship* God...* \n \n May 2004 be the year the silent majority is heard and we put God back as the foundation of our families and institutions. \n \n Keep looking up......

   "<Millions of mindless sheep standing in unison with your right hand over your heart murmering blank words that REALLY mean nothing except a negative type of rhetoric to numb a nation into allegiance. If you do not show the UTMOST respect for this sickening act you are scrutinized, reprimanded, judged, and corrected to stand at attention. What freedome is in that?\n \n We are a Nazi nation and this instance furthers the argument. We kill as a nation, control as a nation, brainwash, commit genocide, and every morning in your schools, ball games, and so on, you offer your credences. A nation of such abusive capitalism, bigotry, nationalism, vivisection, oppression, control, seperation, segregation, restrain, suppression, and police states should not be tolerated for obvious reasons, which really are not the matter here.\n \n The fact that ignorance is used through fear whether it be a media propaganda, delegations, or the pledge of allegiance should have zero tollerance. As a people we are being numbed into a life of no reforms or civil disobediance, because it is NOT TOLLERATED! You are fed lies that being shoved so far down your throat you'll either choke and die in vain, or not be able to speak as to ask any questions. When was the last time you read about a great theologian, a deep thinker, or some sort of philosopher that did not stand for some type of revolution. They were looked down upon just as some are today that have different ideas, but does it not occur to people that just maybe the MINORITIES are the ones with the correct minds, and the MASSES are the ones being absurd? We, not as a nation, not as a race, not a class or type, but as HUMANS need to stand out and question methods. THINK...it's your right.<\n <Right...for my little Patriots like this person for example, also look at my response to flag burning. I knew I would get the cliche' of \"WOO!! Love it or leave it!!!!\" bullcrap. I just wish for once you conservatives would find a better argument than \"WHY DON'T YOU JUST MOVE TO RUSSIA?!!!\" But it's fine...I still get a good laugh from you.<\n \n okay. let me tell you something. i don't identify myself as a conservative, im a libertarian. VERY big difference. i personally dislike the fact that our schools are willing indocterators(sp) of our children. the indocternation beong the fact that they are more or less brainwashed into thinking that they MUST love and support this country at all times, and even when they get older, most aren't smart enough to realize this. other then this and the fact thats its a loyalty oath, i could care less. on to your Nazi comment. that was an ignorant comment. most folk don't hate a particular people. Genocide... i still don't know where THAT one came from, esp. because you don't seem to know what a genocide IS. so i'll define it for yas. Genocide-n. a masss wipe-out of a particular people, poltical party or religion. this is a loose def. of it, and i really don't see the US wiping out anyone of those things. wow. you are a VERY dramatic person.... anyway, im not particually patroitic/nationalistic, but talking t you is like banging my head on a wall. repeatdly. :xbanghead :xbanghead :xbanghead :xbanghead \n \n \n \n \n ouch, major headache.",

   "I would not classify myself as a \"fanatic\" I believe what I choose to, for the reasons I choose, even though I do firmly stand behind most of my beliefs. I am a Christian, a patriot, and pro-choice (and I dont mean I support abortion). I am an Independant who leads towards the right. I do not \"blindly follow\" others. For instance, Christianity. I am a devout Baptist. I do not automatically accept the preacher's message as gospel. You must first compare it to the Book he is supposedly teaching from, the Bible. The reason I am is a Baptist, is because it openly encourages reading the Bible for yourself. Unlike Catholocism, which puts religious leaders in the pulpits reading out a Bible, to a crowd largely without Bibles, who draw Gospel from the speaker's words. No, the Baptist philosophy includes reading the Holy Book for yourself, so you can see for yourself, in black and white, the truth.\n \n About Patriots. What have you against them? If it wasn't for Patriots there wouldn't even be an America, and I highly doubt you would have the level of freedom you now enjoy. Patriots have sacrificed their lives for generations to keep their rights, and for love of country. And yes, love of country is necessary. I love my country and I would like to think I would give my life for my country, if called to. Love of country unites people and helps keep politicians in check.\n \n I am also Pro-Choice, and no I am not saying I am for abortion. I am for being able to choose whether or not you want to own a weapon. The Second Amendment protects my right to own a firearm, and I will never give up my personal safety for any reason. Europe has outlaws the individual ownership of firearms, and their crime rate has sharply increase. Their was also a study done, in which an entire neighborhood put signs in their yards, proudly claiming to be gun free homes. These homes were more prone to criminal activity, i.e. break-ins and robberys, than a normal home, with no sign. If you ban firearms, you take away the right of the average American to protect themselves. The criminals already obtain their weapons illegaly, so what will change? They will still illegally obtain their firearms, and use them illegaly. While American citizens will lose their ability to protect themselves.\n \n Now I know this has nothing to do with the topic, but I HAD to respond to this comment.\n\n \n umm... im a Catholic, thank you. and the fact is, we ARE encouraged to use the bible, rather then blindly follow the priest. and every Catholic is supposed to have a bible at home. i had two, but gave one to a pagan friend. do me one little favor and don't talk about what you don't know. no offense, but honsetly..........",
