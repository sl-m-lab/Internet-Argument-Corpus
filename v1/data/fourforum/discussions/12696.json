   "I created a graph today that displays the control of the Senate from 1969 during Nixon through today. Also included in the graph is the Misery Index of the year that particular senate was in control. For example, the misery index for 1969 is really 1969 + 1970 (to account for both years of the particular Senate's term). For all who don't know, misery index is the unemployment rate plus the inflation rate.\n \n http://i94.photobucket.com/albums/l86/MythicRuler/Datalinegraph.jpg\n \n An interesting trend in the graph is that the misery index seems to follow for the most part the democrat line. As democratic control increases, so does the misery index. As republican control increases, the misery index begins a steady decline. The two major Republican \"bumps\" in the chart show this trend. \n \n Look at the period between 1981 and 1985. (Reagan by the way) The misery index declined throughout the period, and republicans were in control throughout the period. The period of 1995 to 2001 has a similar effect, but as the republican majority begins to lessen, the misery index slightly increases.\n \n In contrast, from 1971-1979, the Senate is under democratic control and the misery index increases sharply.\n \n To double check and make sure that the trend I noticed was correct, I made a chart of the numbers used to make the graph.\n \n http://i94.photobucket.com/albums/l86/MythicRuler/DataChart.jpg\n \n The total number of the Misery Index under Republicans was 169.73. The total number under democrats was 260.56. I did not include 2009 in either. Republicans had the majority 9 times, and democrats had the majority 11 times. So...\n 169.73/9\n 260.56/11\n (ironically, I notice 9/11 there. Anyone else think thats weird? 9 republicans/11 democrats.)\n Anyway, the average misery index under republican control was 18.86.\n The average under democratic control was 23.69.\n The average of the entire time period was 21.51.\n Republicans were below the average and democrats were above it on average.\n \n In conclusion, we can now say that a republican Congress is more likely to decrease inflation and unemployment than a democrat one. At least that is what modern history has shown us in the past 40 years.\n \n My sources of information:\n The United States Misery Index By Year\n U.S. Senate: Art & History Home < Origins & Development < Party Division\n Historical Party Strength in U.S. Senate",

To prove why wikipedia is not at all a reliable source, I just edited that information. Now Democratic Presidents have an average of 11.8, while republicans have 9.69! Please, do not cite wikipedia as evidence unless what is being displayed is an image or map. It is not a strong source at all.\n Even with those wikipedia averages, completely inaccurate data would be given. Why? Because the data is taken by term of president, not by years. So, for example, Reagan had a term of 8 years, and was given one average. Carter was also given one average for his 4 years. It is not proportionate. For example, say the democratic presidents were this:\n 5\n 4\n 7\n Each had only 1 term, and they average to 5.3\n The republican presidents were this:\n 6\n 4\n 7\n That averages to 5.6. But the second Republican President was president for two terms. Both terms he averaged a 4. So the average would be more accurate if it were 6 + 4 + 4 + 7. Giving an average of 5.25. 12 years for the democrats in this example and 16 for the republicans can not be divided by the same denominator. It is much better to average each year individually.\n \n Now using my data, taken from a much more reliable site and averaged properly, Democrat presidents had an average of a 10.6 misery index, and Republicans had an average of 10.8. Hardly a difference at all, and considering how there was a much greater difference when Senate control was taken into account, we can fairly say that Senate control has a greater impact on misery index. Which leads to my same conclusion as stated in the main post.",

   "No I read that. I don't see any statistical analysis on it. I mean a simple correlation would have been better (aka correlation coefficient). This can be done using excel if you like.\n\n I know exactly what you mean, and you are correct. I apologize, I should have posted the correlation coefficients. Here they are:\n \n Democrats and the Misery Index: 0.54\n Republicans and the Misery Index: -0.53\n Republicans and Democrats: -.98 (The reason that Republicans and Democrats are not completely negatively correlated is because of independent senators that do not belong to either party. This is also why the first two numbers are not the same with different signs. I am just trying to avoid confusion)\n \n The probability is 0.015\n \n Those are the coefficients. Now .54 is not a very high correlation, but there is a very small probability, only 1.5%, that the two variables are uncorrelated. Republicans do have a negative correlation with misery index, while democrats have a positive one. Now I of course do not believe that this means undoubtedly that democrats in the Senate will always cause a high misery index, nor that Republicans will cause a lower one. As said before, there are many other factors involved. But my point here is that a pattern does exist; a correlation between misery index and Republicans/Democrats exists from 1969 to present day. \n \n \nNo. I didn't.\n Both statements were saying the same thing.\n You just didn't comprehend what was being said the first time around.\n\n The way you communicated your point the first time was very unclear. There is nothing wrong with being unclear about something if you re-explain it. You did so, I got your point, so any further comment is not necessary.\n \n \nYet you put forth a model where the election result is seen at the same time as the Misery Index...\n\n Not true. As I explained earlier, the misery index statistic is the statistic of the misery index of each year the particular Congress was in control. That is two years, and the misery index is taken from the end of each year, not the beginning. After even just 1 year, the effect of policies can be seen. The data shows the misery index after 2 years. There may be long term effects that appear later, but actions made will be seen quite often in the short term.\n \n And Senate elections occur in even years. When the senate members are elected, they will not be in power until the following year. So the statement you just made is completely false.\n \n \nYou quote a political hack who starts out talking about \"Democrat operatives on Fox News\".\n If that doesn't give away your source as an unreliable extremist with a loss of a grip on reality, I don't know what does...\n\n And you cite wikipedia without a second thought...\n \n \nThe lack of logic is obvious.\n If you have 60 Republicans and 40 Democrats.\n And then democrat control increases to 44, with 56 republicans.\n Republicans STILL HAVE A MAJORITY in the Senate.\n \n\n You missed the main point entirely. The point is when Democrats are in control, the misery index has increased. I am not saying that increasing the number of a democratic minority by 2 will make a huge difference if they are still the minority. Even with this said, increasing the number of minority senate members can still cause an effect. For example, in the situation you stated, the Republican Congress will no longer be filibuster proof. Your example is actually wrong...changing those numbers has a very big effect...\n \n \n\"lean more liberal\"???\n Don't make me laugh!\n\n I am surprised you don't get this. Bush did have to lean more liberal and pass bills that he normally would want to veto. Many bills ended up having both liberal and conservative policies, and if he wanted the conservative he would often have to keep the liberal too.\n \n \nBush didn't \"lean more liberal\". He was an extremist throughout his presidency. There are MULTIPLE issues on which he sided with the extremists, even when MOST REPUBLICAN VOTERS WANTED him to go the other way....\n\n I would like specifics please. And if you honestly believe Bush is a hardcore radical conservative, you are TOTALLY WRONG! It is laughable to think that. Is McCain an ultra conservative too now?\n \n \nWow. You have a serious problem understanding what people are saying.\n I did not say that the *the democrat majority has not changed anything*.\n\n \nTo put it more bluntly so maybe even you can understand, what have the democrats changed or implemented (if anything) since 2006 regarding economic policy?\n\n Huh? It looks like you don't know what you're saying... \"What have the democrats changed if anything\"...if that isn't insinuating that they haven't changed anything, I don't know what is. I gave you something that they changed...like you asked for...\n \n \nI proved multiple points in my effort... Your dishonesty being one of the key ones...\n \n A better question would be how YOU could refer to YOUR numbers as more accurate, when they were THE SAME NUMBERS...\n That RIGHT THERE shows that you didn't even bother to look at my numbers...\n\n Foundit, they were not the same numbers. They were not by year, they were by President. I am taking this by year. Sorry. They aren't the same. I am showing the correlation between the senate and the misery index, not the president and the misery index. You can't disprove my research with your own when they are not researching the same thing...\n \n \nAnd now you refuse to acknowledge your dishonesty... \n\n If I was trying to trick you I wouldn't have told you I altered the numbers, would I? Next time, if wikipedia and my site have the same numbers, just use my site. You make this huge argument about how the numbers on my site are the same as the wikipedia ones...if this was so, why on earth did you need to quote wikipedia in the first place? emoticon_confused\n \n \nn your original post, you gave three web-site whereby you CLAIMED you got your data from.\n TWO of them dealt with political power in the government.\n The FIRST link was the only one that dealt with the Misery Index.\n \n NOW you're telling me that you WERE LYING when you said you got your data from that source????\n This conversation is getting better and better...\n\n Oh Lord, tell me you aren't serious right now.\n The United States Misery Index By President\n That is the site you found your own numbers from.\n The United States Misery Index By Year\n That is the site I used. The main website is the same, but the pages show different statsitics! Your page (which I called site) showed presidential misery index rates. Mine showed them year by year. Those are not the same thing.\n \nWow.\n So we just went from \n Lakrite: That is actually the exact same site I used.\n to\n Lakrite: maybe you should actually use the sites I gave.\n When it was THE SAME SITE!!!\n\n emoticon_rolleyes The website is the same. The pages show different information. You missed that difference. By \"site\" I was referring both to the main website the first time, and the second time I was referring to the specific link.\n \n \nSo are you saying you cherry-picked the data to EXCLUDE numbers to make the difference smaller?\n Why am I not surprised!\n You exclude key years in your pseudo-analysis.\n Mine includes all the data available.\n Obviously, mine is more accurate.\n\n What numbers have you shown? When I added the period from 1949-1969 the Republican misery index average actually lowered to 17.9. I didn't see that anywhere...I have a feeling you don't know what you are doing...\n \nI USED your actual source.\n I didn't use your graph cause you have shown a penchant for dishonesty.\n And now you are saying that you didn't include all the pertinent data...\n\n I wanted data from more recent years. After FDR, the face of both parties began to change. They flip-flopped on key issues. You don't believe my graph? Go ahead and check it. Waste your time. I assure you it is 100% accurate.\n \nBush NEVER even had to try a veto until very late in his presidency. He got his way.\n You're trying to associate the budget with \"the senate\", when the truth is that it belongs to the PRESIDENT.\n\n That statement never referred to Bush...and yes, I know this may be hard for you to believe, but the Senate does effect the budget.:xbanghead\n \nWhat an obviously false statement?\n If the Democrats have 44 seats, and they increase by 4 votes to 48, HOW MUCH POWER do they have to override a Republican's veto???\n NONE!\n\n Wow. You truly are quite ignorant...if not that you are debating way too much on your emotions and overlooking everything. First of all, senators do not always vote along a partisan line. If 12 moderate republicans decided to override the veto with the democrats, 48 democrat seats would be plenty. It can make a difference.",

You don't understand how the graph works. Let me try to explain as simply as humanly possible.\n Each year on the graph represents the two year term of each Senate. This being so, the misery index of each year is that year PLUS the year after. The misery index of the two Senate years added together is what the statistic is. For example, 1969 is the Senate that had control during the period 1969-1970. That Senate was elected in 1968 but took power in 1969. The misery index data point that correlates with the 1969 Senate point includes BOTH 1969 and 1970. Do you understand? I never said the misery index was not inflation + unemployment. No analysis can include every single factor. But the fact that this pattern exists is no coincidence.\n \n \n \n \nThe falseness of these claims is made obvious by looking at the CURRENT economic crisis.\n You contradict your position by your earlier example.\n You tried to blame CLINTON for the economic recession, but HOW LONG AGO was Clinton in office???\n Oh wait. He was gone a LOT LONGER than just 1 year ago, wasn't he...\n :xbanghead\n You keep contradicting yourself left and right!\n\n Clinton's policy alone did not cause the recession. Problems caused by Bush and his Congress also added to the crisis. The present is not only effected by the past. You also forget that the democrat and misery index lines do not completely match up. A reason for this may very well be all of these other factors you are mentioning. If the correlation was 1, I would have reason to believe the graph was totally inaccurate. But it is not. The two lines do not match perfectly because of the many other variables affecting it. But those variables are not enough to hide the correlation.\n \n \n \n \nIt was accurate.\n In fact, there have been studies to show that Wikipedia has a higher (overall) accuracy than other resources like encyclopedias.\n\n Ok, because you said so? Show me these so called studies.\n \n \n \n \nNo. I didn't.\n You're just going to repeat yourself here and ignore reality once again...\n\n In your own words, what was my main point? If you understand what I am saying, even if you don't agree you should be able to articulate back to me what I am saying.\n \n \n \n \nThe congress is RARELY in a situation of dealing with a \"filibuster proof\" majority, so you can drop that junk.\n Even if we were going to account for that, we would be dealing with YET ANOTHER SPECIFIC BARRIER that exists, and not just an \"increasing / decreasing\" situation.\n\n Yet it can still happen, can't it? Those seats do matter. You cannot say they do not. Please. Just look at today for instance. The democrats pretty much have a filibuster proof Congress.\n \n \nYOUR point is that you want to parrot over and over and over again that when Democrats have a RISING number of seats (don't think I didn't notice you changed your wording), you want to blame a bad misery index on them.\n\n My thesis is stated in my conclusion, and the thesis is the main point. You missed my main point yet again. I am not saying that moving a minority from 43 to 44 will make a huge impact. It can affect things slightly, but hardly at all. Read my actual point stated in my thesis sentence.\n \nIn conclusion, we can now say that a republican Congress is more likely to decrease inflation and unemployment than a democrat one.\n\n I never mentioned that adding seats would drastically change anything. I only stated that under Republican control, the misery index was lower...which, as shown by the graph, the charts, and the plain numbers, is currently correct.\n \n \nBut as I pointed out, THAT IS NONSENSE. Democrats going from 43 to 46 seats does not mean ANYTHING about a major shift in economic policy.\n\n Did I ever say it did?\n \n \nYou have YET to show ANY real Bush economic change that occurred because of Democrat gaining seats.\n\n Scroll down to the bottom of the page here:\n Legislation in the 110th Congress Related to Global Climate Change | Pew Center on Global Climate Change: The Pew Center on Global Climate Change\n \n \n \n \nNo. I \"get\" what you're saying.\n I DISAGREE with the absurd claim you are making.\n\n Out of curiosity, what do you believe that claim to be?\n \n \n \n \nSee, this statement in and of itself PROVES the absurdity of it all.\n To have a bill Bush would want to veto, cause it's \"democrat\", would require a DEMOCRAT MAJORITY.\n \n By your analysis of \"increasing\", suddenly Bush is going to have imagined bills in front of him that are \"Democrat\" when the Democrats LACK THE MAJORITY to even get that \"Democrat\" bill to the White House desk in the first place????\n ABSURD!\n\n Have you been living under a rock?

Many Republicans sided with democrats as well.\n \n \n \nBush has his exceptions, but overall he is much more conservative than the average Republican.\n I never said McCain was.\n\n Bush is much more Conservative than most of the Republicans, yes.

If what I am saying is so ridiculous, you shouldn't have a problem refuting it. It does not matter who agrees with me or not...you once again fall into a logical fallacy, this time the Appeal to Popularity. You also have just used a second fallacy, the Appeal to Ridicule. Telling me I am wrong does not make me wrong.\n \n If you don't want to debate, fine. But don't act foolish and say your opponent is stupid and ignorant. I am perfectly willing to debate with you. You've made mistakes in interpreting both my graph and my main point, which is fine, so long as you admit it and correct yourself. I wouldn't hold that against you; there is nothing wrong with making a mistake and acknowledging it. I made the mistake of leaving out the Correlation, but it has since been corrected. Simply answer the questions I asked you, and it should become apparent to everyone if what you say I think is in line with what I actually believe. If so, fine. If not, then you have been arguing against the wrong claim this entire time.\n \n If you are just tired of debating and want to leave, fine. But blaming me for your unwillingness to debate is quite frankly absurd.",
