First the business decision.\n \n \n\n And again, for the hotel owner, it still seems to me that potentially eliminating over 90% of possible clientele out there seems like a very UN-savvy business descision--I would think there would still be so many gays who would go to the \"mainstream\" hotels that it would not be worth it. But hey, maybe I'm wrong. \n\n \n You are clearly wrong. There are oodles of gay businesses and they do great. Better than if they reached out to a broader crowd. Your logic is skewed. Every business appeals to a certain segment of the population. 10% of 300M is still a big chunk. This is a lucrative niche market. You act as if you've never heard of it.\n \n \n Second issue. Why does it work?\n \n \n\n Interesting. I would think that the descision about where to stay at a hotel would be based on many factors, not just whether the guy at the desk happens to react a funny way or something, of give a \"heckling\".

You do not seem to understand the way gays are treated in this world. You put \"heckling\" in quotes, suggesting you are dismissive of the problem. If you don't notice something, it doesn't exist, I guess. Being treated like sh!t is no small deal. Some times it is even dangerous. \n \n To answer your question.\n I would try to never stay anywhere that treated me badly, for whatever reason. I would never stay anywhere that didn't have \"squeaky clean rooms\". But all else being equal, I would stay in the better hotel. But that's me. Others may prefer the company of gays or simply are tired of putting up with the bullsh!t in some establishments; others maybe perceive a problem that isn't there anymore.\n \n It depends where you are. There isn't a place in New York that would bat an eye at a gay couple. I stay at a Holiday Inn when I visit family in Ohio and the staff are clueless. Some don't even consider that my partner and I are a couple (They've heard of homos, they're on TV now, but never seen none) and a few others are outwardly hostile.
