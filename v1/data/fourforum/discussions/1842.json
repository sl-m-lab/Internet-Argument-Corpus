   "The only reason I doubt that there is intellegent life in our universe is based on my expectations of what humans will do in the coming million years. First off lets assume the universe is 10 billion years old. It took billions of years for life to form and evolve here into intellegent life. So the probability of a new intellegent life forming in any given span of 1 million years is very small. Also it takes about 1 million years for intellegent life to advance radically to be able to travel through space itself. Humans have been around for about 500,000 - 700,000 years. In the next 300,000 years we will either destroy ourselves or expand our civilization deep into the universe either through colonizing a planet or simply building machines to do work in remote areas of the universe. I would suspect that if we survive for another 300,000 years we will be able to detect whether other life forms exist in space. Based on this I believe that if intellegent life did exist elsewhere in the universe that it is highly unlikely that they are anywhere near our level of technology. They either developed well before us and are far more technologically advanced than us or they have yet to develop into intellegent life. If there was intellegent life out there that was vastly technologically advanced we would have already seen evidence of this as they would have shown interest in us due to our ability to travel the stars.\n \n Basically I don't think there is advanced intellegent life in space because it is highly unlikely that we are sharing space with another form of life that is close to our level of technology and that if there were truely advanced forms of life in space we would have already become aware of them.\n \n But then again, my opinion only goes as far as to say intellegent life does not exist in space. I'm not sure whether or not I believe there is other life out there. If there is it would only make sense that over time it would develop into intellegent life. Since we have yet to see any evidence of intellegent life I am going to have to say that I believe we are the only speck of life in the universe.",

If we were to run out of almost all resources on this planet I don't doubt that there would be a trend towards genetic tweaking that would alter us to need almost nothing to sustain ourselves or possible even turning ourselves into a mechanic form of life assuming we are able to gain a much better grasp of how the human brain works. Now war, that is a way to wipe us out. I don't think lack of resources will be the end of us however unless it causes the war.\n \n \nI wouldnt be surprised if there was intellegent life out there, possibly with similar primate body structure as ours even. however, communicating with them would be virtually impossible. only in the last 100 years or so have we been seriously been able to look into the depths of space with real success, far less been able to transmit communications to whoever is out there. what's the probability in 100,000 years our transmissions are intercepted by a race 100,000 years behind us 100,000 light years away? by the time they attempt to respond humanity would probably be extinct, making the whole exercise utterly hopeless\n\n \n If we had been transmitting our signals for 100,000 years then I don't think the receivers would have to worry about contacting us as we would have already contacted them physically. That is my real assumption here, that given enough time any advanced race is going to create some sort of system to investigate the universe and find all other forms of life as well as all other inhabitable planets. I don't doubt for a second that we would find a way to create an AI who only has the task of flying to other planets, creating industry using available resources, and using the industry to create more of itself to continue to search the universe as well as make the planet more habitable.\n \n \nlike i said, it doesnt matter if they are close to our level of intellegence, although you seem to assume that humans are lucky to be so advance in a shorter than average timespan. suppose we are the slow evolvers? \n\n \n I am assuming we are average evolvers or maybe even on the slow side. That is why I'm so sure there are no other forms of intelligent life out there. Now if we were fast evolvers then I might need to rethink my theory.\n \n \nanyway, if the closest habitable planet is just as advanced as us, but 100,000 light years away, then you will truly never see signs of intellegent life from them. but that hardly suggests they dont exist. and even if they were advanced enough to transmit signals 100 times faster than the speed of light, we dont have the technology to intercept such a signal. hmmm...\n\n \n Perhaps we never would find them as long as we and they were only as advanced as we are today. Extend our existance another 100,000 years and contact with them would be inevitable. We would both need to be looking to expand our civilization and explore other planets. Our respective machines would also be scouting out all corners of the universe looking for resources, homes, and other forms of life. Our technology would be as such that it would be impossible for us both to miss each other or for even one of us to miss the other. So if there is another intelligent form of life out there that is even one-quarter of a million years more advanced than us which is a small amount of time considering the age of our universe, then I expect that they would have already found us.",
