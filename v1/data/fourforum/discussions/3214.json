   "I haven't heard this discussed, maybe I just missed it, but has anyone raised a question or done a comparison of Kerry's 4 month service in Vietnam to that of others serving in the war. Specifically, it's my understanding that after his 3rd \"Purple Heart\" he was eligible to leave Vietnam and as we all know he definitely jumped on the opportunity. Now, I'm sure that others were injured more than two times and I'm wondering if those guys got out as soon as possible as well. Don't get me wrong, if I had three SERIOUS injuries in four months, I'd be wondering if my number was up and maybe I should get the hell out of Dodge. BUT, as we all know, Kerry's \"injuries\" are somewhat dubious to say the least (aaahhhhhhhh, but we may never really know because Kerry won't sign the forms to release ALL his records, not just the ones HE controls). I was just wondering if anyone else was thinking this as well. Not sure if it can be done, but I would be very interested in the results if it COULD be done (the comparison that is). Hey, IF all the others did the same thing based on similar injuries, I won't say another word (about THIS anywa)",
