   "PRI Weekly Briefing \n 27 February 2004 \n Vol. 6 / No. 8\n \n \n \n About F.A.C.E: Forced Abortions Now Legal In the U.S. \n \n \n The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act makes the violation of a woman's right to receive reproductive health care a federal crime. It is hard to imagine a worse violation of reproductive rights than forced abortion. Yet the Eleventh Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals apparently disagrees.\n \n \n On 23 January 2004, in Jane Roe II vs. Aware Women Center for Choice, Inc., the Eleventh Circuit Court ruled that an expectant mother can be aborted by force if the abortionist argues that it is necessary to \"protect the health of the mother.\"\n \n \n The story begins on 29 March 1997, when a young, pregnant mother entered the Aware Women Center for Choice clinic in Florida. She was there for an abortion.\n \n \n Awaiting her was the abortionist, William P. Egherman, who has committed over 10,000 abortions and who has, perhaps not surprisingly, been addicted to alcohol and opiates. He began the procedure by attempting to dilate the woman's cervix with a 12 millimeter dilator.\n \n \n \"My God, you're hurting me\" the woman began to scream. \"You're killing me, I'll never be able to have babies,,,. Stop!\"\n \n \n The woman had had a change of heart. She did not want an abortion. She wanted to keep her baby. And she wanted to leave. Immediately. \"Stop. Let me out of here,\" she cried.(1)\n \n \n Instead of respecting the woman's wishes and stopping the procedure, Egherman called for assistance. Clinic workers held the woman down as Egherman, ignoring the woman's screams, continued to dilate her cervix. Then he entered the victim with a pair of forceps--\"the bear\" Ehgerman called them (2)--and began probing and pulling. He mistakenly pulled out part of the woman's intestines. For the woman, said her attorney, Chris Sapp, it was like being drawn and quartered.\n \n \n Realizing what he had done, Egherman heavily sedated the woman. Then he called for an ambulance. He instructed the ambulance to come slowly, without lights or sirens, in order to give him \"time to pack the woman with gauze.\"\n \n \n Egherman was also worried that his regular flow of business would be interrupted by \"all the hoopla.\" \"Saturday's our big day,\" he explained, \"and I didn't want to generate a lot of,,, any more confusion, any more panic than was already present at the time. She was loud, and as I said, she was shrill, and there were a lot of patients who were hearing what was going on, and the normal rhythm of the day was interrupted. The other patients must have been terrified, and I didn't want the ambulance showing up with all the lights and sirens,,,\"\n \n \n At the hospital, the woman was operated on and the damage to her internal organs repaired. Her baby was found to be dead, and was removed.\n \n \n There the matter would have ended, if not for the intervention of attorney, and former judge, Chris Sapp. Sapp filed suit on her behalf in the federal courts, arguing that the abortionist had violated the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE). FACE was passed to guarantee the right of women to receive reproductive health care. But if a woman had a right to enter a clinic to get an abortion, Sapp argued, she also has a right to leave a clinic in order to protect herself and her baby.\n \n \n In calling for the abortionist to stop the procedure, Sapp argued, the woman was clearly invoking her rights under the FACE Act. By forcing the abortion procedure on her, and by preventing her from going immediately to a hospital where her pregnancy could have been saved, the abortionist violated her reproductive rights.(3)\n \n \n Egherman's defense attorney's maintained that \"if he [Egherman] had to go back in\" in order to protect the woman's health, then this would not constitute a violation of the FACE Act. On a summary judgment, the appeals court agreed, even though the evidence shows that the abortion had scarcely begun when the woman called for the abortionist to stop the abortion, and that he went \"back in\" to perform the abortion against her will.\n \n \n According to Sapp, \"This ruling does establish a precedent for forced abortion.\" An expectant mother receiving a routine gynecological exam, for example, could be held down and forcibly aborted. The abortionist would merely have to argue that the abortion was necessary to protect the mother's health or life, and this would not be a violation of the FACE Act.\n \n \n PRI has recently learned of another forced abortion in America. A 25-year-old Maryland woman, four months pregnant, changed her mind about having an abortion after being taken to the procedure room. She ran back to the clinic entrance where her boyfriend stopped her. You have to get an abortion, he told her. I've already paid for it. Three clinic workers and the abortionists surrounded the women, sedated her by injection, and then took her back into the procedure room. After the forced abortion, she awoke in a closet.\n \n \n Chris Sapp is determined to fight on. He is prepared to petition the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiori acknowledging that a woman's right to say \"no\" to an abortion, at any point in time, is absolute, and that this right is found in the FACE Act.\n \n \n To make a tax-deductible donation to Chris Sapp and his valiant effort to stop forced abortions in America, please go to PRI's secure site at https://pop.org/donate.cfm\n \n \n Please be sure to write \"for Chris Sapp\" in one of the three available address fields on the on-line donation form.

I decided not to this time, but I probably will at some point.\n \n Mr. Jack, I now agree that the article seems like a distortion or hoax, although I don't agree that the source sounds discreditable. \n \n Darkest Shadow, I have to agree that if its clearly true there are blatant, forced abortions... at least I would want very much to hurt the people who did it. \n \n Sigma and everyone, I don't know about the claim of the \"parking lot\" abortion, perhaps I will follow Nallyo's advice and ask Focus on the Family. The rest of this reply is about \"Jane Roe II\" and her court case....\n \n I apologize for putting this up without checking it's validity. I was so upset after reading it that it just didn't occur to me.\n \n After looking through many articles I have concluded that the evidence does not support the claim that Jane Roe II was forced to stay in the clinic because the doctor wanted to force the abortion against her will. This is her origional claim:\n \n \n Accepting the allegations of the complaint in this case as true, the facts are that on March 29, 1997, Roe entered the defendants' clinic for what was to be her third abortion procedure. Soon after the procedure began, she felt \"extreme, excessive pain in her abdomen\" that she had not experienced during her previous two abortion procedures. Roe demanded that Dr. Egherman stop the procedure and call an ambulance for her. He refused and, instead, instructed four assistants to restrain Roe while he continued to perform the procedure. Roe was eventually taken by ambulance to an emergency room where it was discovered that during the procedure at the clinic she had suffered both a perforated uterus and a colon laceration. At the hospital, the dead fetus was removed from Roe's uterus and she underwent surgery to repair her organs. \n\n \n ( http://www.law.emory.edu/11circuit/june2001/00-10231.man.html )\n \n The crucial part of the case is this statement:\n \n \n Viewed in the light most favorable to her, Roe's complaint alleges that she wanted to go to the hospital to obtain some kind of \"medical\" or \"surgical\" services \"relating to\" either her \"reproductive system\" or \"the termination of [her] pregnancy.\" Id. \u00a7 248(e)(5). For purposes of FACE, it matters not whether the reason Roe wanted to leave the clinic immediately and go to a hospital emergency room was so that she could have the damage done to her uterus repaired, or because she had changed her mind and wanted to save the pregnancy, or because she wanted to have the abortion completed at a hospital instead of at the clinic. If the defendants restrained Roe for the purpose of preventing her from obtaining any of those services, then she has adequately pleaded a violation of FACE because all of those services fall within the statutory definition of \"reproductive health services.\" \n\n \n ( http://www.law.emory.edu/11circuit/june2001/00-10231.man.html )\n \n As the case goes on to say, Jane Roe II did not succesfully argue that the purpose of the restraint was to prevent her from obtaining treatment for her damaged uterus, saving the baby, or having the abortion done at a hospital. Instead, the claim of the doctor, that \"if they did restrain Roe, the only reason they did so was to protect her life and health and prevent further injury from the complications that had arisen during the course of the abortion procedure\" seems to have more merit, based on the final 11th circuit court of appeal's deliberations and decision at:\n http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200314071.pdf\n \n The main thing which bothers me is why the doctor called an ambulance but instructed it to come quietly, without lights, so that he would have time to \"stabilize\" her. I think that this may have been done for the purpose of preventing panic in the waiting room, and perhaps to allow time to do the abortion. However, the dead baby was removed at the hospital - indicating that the abortion was not completed, and giving the credible possiblity that it died indirectly. It is also credible that Roe needed to be stabalized before any movement, but it still doesn't make sense that the doctor should tell the ambulance not to come at high speed. (the case description only says that an ambulance was called, however it was said in other articles that the lights were not on and high speed was not requested) So, I think that the purpose was to prevent alarm in the customers. (which has nothing to do with the FACE legislation on which the trial is based)\n \n So, although it worries me that the clinic would do an abortion on someone as distressed as Roe apparently was, I don't think that the evidence proves a forced abortion. \n \n It is notable that it was decided during the case that the FACE act does make forced abortions a felony, as well as granting anonymity to anyone who claims to be a victim of forced abortion. However, it may also make it possible for a clinician to force an abortion after a \"point of no return\": \"He also testified that full cervical dilation is in effect a point of no return for a woman undergoing an abortion because she stands an intolerable risk of potentially fatal infection if the fetus is not removed\", and a little before that it was stated that no reasonable jury would conlclude \"(1) that Plaintiff revoked her consent to the abortion while it was still medically safe for Dr. Egherman to discontinue...\"\n ( http://www.forerunner.com/fyi/law/roe-v-aw/119o061003.htm )\n \n This aspect of the case seems to set a precedent for a forced abortion if the procedure has reached a \"point of no return\" when it is not \"medically safe... to discontinue\". However, the issue was not decided in this case. I think that it would be avoided if the consent forms for an abortion tell a woman she will not be allowed to stop the abortion after a certain point.\n \n Anyhow, I apologize once again. \n \n \n 11th circuit court's origional decision.\n http://www.law.emory.edu/11circuit/june2001/00-10231.man.html \n \n 11th circuit court's final decision.\n http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200314071.pdf\n \n The district court decision.

   "I'm shocked that POP.org would do that. They have a very good reputation of being accurate. They must have gotten it from a different source.\n\n \n While I was reading related articles, the only ones I found were quoting the PRI president, I'm pretty sure that he got it directly from Roe and her lawyer Chris Sapp.\n \n I think I will ask Focus about the second forced abortion mentioned in the article. \n \n It does seem that the abortion had not really begun before the damage occured to Roe's uterus and colon. I wonder how likely it is that the baby would die from that. It is still possible that Egherman killed the baby after that point, I don't know. \n \n Actually, this case is beginning to confuse me. The issue is, did the doctor and assistants violate FACE by preventing Roe from going to a hospital to get fixed up, save the baby, or to abort it. They did. Roe said she wanted to call her mother and drive to the hospital. The doctor and assistants didn't allow her to. It may be true that it would have jepordized her life if they let her do that. Still, its a clear violation of FACE. And the decision of the court seems to be based on the fact that the doctor claims undisputedly that it would have been dangerous to do so. The claim in the article that a woman could be in for a routine examination and forced to have an abortion is perhaps not so unlikely as I thought. \n \n Perhaps in such a case a person could file a lawsuit on other grounds than that of a violation of FACE.",
