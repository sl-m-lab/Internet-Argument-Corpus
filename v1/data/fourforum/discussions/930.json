   "I suppose I would support paying them a reasonable amount of money since they do bring in money for playing sports for the school. But the argument to this is that they are already getting a free education in many cases and there are also other clubs that bring in money for the school who don't get paid for it.\n \n I wasn't an athlete in college so I don't know how tough they really have got it. By the way some of them act they are just getting by with working a part time job while in school and practicing for their sport. If it would be feasible for the school to pay them as much as they would make at a part time job so they could better focus on school and their sports career, I wouldn't have a problem with it. However, if some schools start getting paid over $20k per year for any athlete just to try and attract more talent, then they are going to far. There has to be a tight and low limit on how much a school can compensate to an athlete so that this doesn't get used as a bargaining tool.",

   "If you raise ticket prices too much, people will stop going to the games. And if you expect to fund paying college athletes a salary, then you would have raise ticket prices ALOT.\n\n \n What do you consider a lot? Lets say the average attendance is 100k and there are 12 games. That totals 1200k tickets. Raising the ticket price by $1 makes an additional $1.2m. At a max salary of $20k for the best players and less for the less exceptional players, lets say the average is $15k for a 100 player team. Ticket prices would increase $1.25.\n \n I based these numbers on Ohio States football schedule, attendance, and roster so sorry if they don't fit for every team. Anyways I wouldn't expect ticket prices to go up that much if a reasonable cap is put in place. I also would suspect that players are getting paid under the table already so this would eliminate the need for the which will lower the raise in ticket prices even more.\n \n \n \n \nIf you pay athletes, then other people who compete throughout the school who are not athletes will expect to be paid.

Take the money that you would pay athletes, and use it to improve the school campus or other hurting programs in the school.\n\n \n I already mentioned this as a problem. I don't know the solution but I would suspect that the football athletes bring in more money than any other group other than maybe basketball at some schools.\n \n There is no shortage but the reason to pay athletes is for their benefit. They may have a tough time studying, working, and training and if they could get enough to make ends meet without having to work that may improve their play on the field and what they gain from their attendance at school. You being a big fan of education have to appreciate that.\n \n Maybe you don't feel bad for the jocks, but I don't feel too bad for the school either hauling in the big buck for every single game the players are in. They can afford to take a small hit if it can be determined that the players simply cannot handle the lifestyle expected of most of them. Also if you don't like that sports is such a profitable industry then why not simply avoid watching it all together. Perhaps you do already but if not then your supporting something you claim is wrong. Also you have suggested in a another post that our universities are already the best in the world. You dislike our high schools as I recall and I am not asking that high schoolers get any money for this as most of them are just doing it for the attention and the women and not as a profession :)",

So if my winter jackets rips while I am part of the Fab 5 in cold Michigan, I'll just walk around when its 10 below in my sweats and tee shirt.\n\n \n What about the 37 y/o center? Would he still play if you took the monetary award away from him? I think you will find all the players in the NFL love the game, but would not continue to play without money. This is not the issue. And what about college students that can't have a part time job? Many students do not have the time to work a part time job, not just athletes. Should we pay all of them, whether they are athletes or not? Many students who go to college are not blessed with the superior athletic ability to play at the college level. In all fairness, should we not pay them too, as they are disadvantaged? And Dwayne Wade? WHO CARES!!! So he went to the NBA. Great for him. Anyone who is good enough to go in to compete in sports at a professional level will be compensated enough when they get there. If they are not good enough to play professionaly, then they should be focused on academics more than sports anyway. Sadly, you must come to reality and recognize the fact that college is for academics first. A full ride academic scholarship rewards scholastic achievement. There are full ride scholarships for athletes as well, they reward the ablility to play sports. As a parent with children who will one day go to college (hopefully), I resent the fact that sport scholarships are part of the reason I will be paying out the XXX for my child's education. Sports are a wonderful part of our society, and a great part of the college experience, but the intent of college is to provide an education. So they can't afford a jacket? Let them do what I did, get a loan and be in debt for a few years after school. If they go on to the NBA, MLB, NFL or whatever, they will be able to pay it back. If not, hopefully they spent their time wisely in college and got an education, and now can get a job, and pay back their loans. I did several theater productions in college, and was not compensated for it. They were time consuming. I had very little time to do anything other than study and pratice for the production. I did this because I enjoyed what I was doing. I did not expect money for it. If I had gone on to make a career out of this, then I would be making money at it.",

   "First of all, paying college athletes for paying an INTERCOLLEGIATE sport is dumb. This is coming from a DIII athlete himself. College athletes are amateur athletes, meaning there is no paycheck or endorsements. If a college of any size were to pay their athletes to play to do guys understand the finicial background for that? Some colleges have 300-400 plus athletes, and your talkin about paying the top athletes $15,000 a year? Even if you were to raise ticket prices by a $1. You don't pay college athletes, thats how it goes. They're amateur athletes who are not only in school to play basketball, baseball, soccer or football but are also there to get an education. Plus for DI and DII schools a majority of these athletes are going to school for free. So if you were to look at it that way they are already getting a $20,000-35,000/ year paycheck or endorsement.\n And with the comment about college football attendence, UCONN was just bumped up to DI-A Football, attendence with a new stadium= average of 35,000 a game and it holds 40k. Tennessee averages about 75,000 to 100,000 a game and there stadium holds 120,000. Miami, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Maine, Syracuse, UCLA, Ohio State, Notre Dame, Texas, all these schools and then some will either sell out there seats every saturday afternoon or come pretty damn close it.",

   "If you ever get a chance, rent the movie, The Program. Its a movie about a college football team and everything that goes on in college football/athletics. Or at least a taste of it. If I can recall you'll see a sign where the athletes are at a banquet and one of the players is given a envelope with cash in it. \n \n I've met and become a friend with a few of the football players at UCONN they've told me a few times that ALL athletes recieve cash some how in some way at banquets and off campus activities. College athletes do not need to get paid. Like I said before they're getting paid 20,000+/year for just going to school. A free ride to go to school to learn is the most any college athlete needs. \n \n and the guy that said take the football profits and split them 50/50...thats really pigheadish and i'll be willing to bet you didnt thing that one through. you just can't pay the football players. There are all the other athletes on campus who see that and wonder why they arent getting paid. plus you may have some athletic games on campus that either don't charge admission or don't charge as much. Some schools like UCONN, Miami, Maine, Ohio State, etc., those tickets can be up to 40 bucks plus. and basketball tickets are just as much. So even if you were to split the profits between the school and the team it would be an unfair balance to the other programs.\n Also what you may not realize is the money made in ticket sales usually go back to the athletic program to help fund for roadtrips to games, new equipment, field maintence, facility maintence, etc.",

   "$15,000? WOW, I wasn't even asking for that. But this past few weekends we get to watch how the BCS screws teams over and over again. But they still make hmm... a mere $11 million dollars. Oh well. Tell the Dukes and North Carolina's to recruit based on GPA not PPG. That would start things for ya. That $15,000 is way to high, we can't expect college students to do taxes so we would have to give them less money so they wouldn't be forced to do taxes, right? You sure the heck wouldn't have minded the extra cash to go to the store and buy food. You probably don't even get free shoes. These poor kids only at the top schools get the free stuff, but D3 is not as lucky. And why should UCONN be pounding on smaller schools? They have D1 Basketball but then try to cheap out on football. Yeah many other schools don't have football or in the same situation, but UCONN, they have had many good teams in recent years so they should try to compete at a higher level and more recruiting. Smarter kids, more money in the ecomony.....theres the answer.",

   "It was just an arbitrary number. If I changed it to $5 per practice and $10 per game would that change any minds? I don't have any idea what a feasible number would be and I don't even know if the athletes need the money. As I've said before, if it can be shown that the athletes simply cannot perform their school work because they spend all their time working or training then something should be done and paying them would be one option that I would support. It would have to be done so that it works for the school and the player.\n\n \n i don't know how it is at all of the schools but I do know at my school athletes have to attend study hall sunday through thursday and have complie 12 hours of study time. I go to school near uconn so i have some contacts there and the athletes there have complie 15 hours of study hall. study hall is for Freshman, Sophomores, and Transfers until they average a 2.6. Then they do not have attend study hall more. \n And for division I and II athletics no coach is allowed to have their athletes train more than 20 hours a week. This includes, weighttraining, practice, and games. (Games = 2 hours no matter what sport it is)",

And Uconn's football program is coming around. they had a phenomenal season this year going 9-3 and they played some pretty hardcore teams. It's not like their still playin DI-AA teams. They had enough wins againist big time schools to get a bowl game. but due to the BCS they're one of those teams that are getting screwed. \n paying college athletes is a no-no. It just routines the amateur idea of college sports and it'll ruin the play of the game, because then you'll have the athletes more worried about how much everyone is making and not worried about their grades.",

I'm the president of a student/athlete group called SAAC or Student Athlete Advisory Committee here at my school. The Committee is here to support student athletes, to fundraise for athletic functions, perform community services and lastly to make the life here at our school. But anyways I was selected to attend the NCAA National Leadership Conference this past summer done in Orlando. At the conference we would talk about different issues that arise on campuses and one of them was paying college athletes. The concerns about paying college athletes were, finances-large, medium, small institutions can not afford to pay they're student/athletes do to the fact there is an AVERAGE of 200+ student/athletes at each institution. Secondly it ruins the amatuer notion of intercollegiate athletics. And the last big concern is the fans. Fans of the institutions would be watching a mini NBA, NFL, MLS, MLB, etc. So to react to your statement of us not being able to do anything, there really is, and I'm a part of it.\n \n (last little note: believe it or not there were many athletes at the conference, DI, DII, and DIII who were very much opposed to the idea.)",
