   "All well and good except for the fact that the planet is not what is in need of saving. Humans are what need to be saved. I don't mean saved as in \"Jesus saved me Jethro...pass the pickles\", I mean saved as in after about 500 more years, we humans will probably not exist on this planet. We are not destroying the planet, we are destroying the ability of our species to survive on the planet. The planet in general has survived far greater threats than us humans. The planet was here long before us humans, and will remain long after we are gone. The air will recover...the oceans will clear, the rain forest will grow back, the tin cans will break down. \n \n What I find most amusing is that people fail to see that the only way that humans in general could improve this planet is to get rid of ourselves. I think this is well underway. We as a species are slowly crafting our doom, and probably for the betterment of the planet. I certainly believe in being a good steward of the earth, but even stewardship and environmental consciousness will only serve to prolong our existance, not perpetuate it. \n \n Of course this is only my opinion, and as such should be worshipped as a religion. emoticon_xangel",
