Sad and yet beautiful. If you get a moment to read them I would do so...\n http://www.brokebackmountain.com/splash.html\n \n \n On the other hand I have found the extrememe right wingers to be clutching at straws. One review from Focus on the Family said this rated \"R\" movie was targeted to children....oh please...tell me how a child can go see a rated \"R\" movie? Straight Talk radio called it gay propaganda which only made me laugh. \n \n What do you think.....",

   "A \"Bi Movie.\" emoticon_xangel LOL!!!\n\n \n That's not all it is, however.\n \n \n \nI don't care if you put out 10 movies a year with homosexual relationships in them. But don't expect everyone to go see them.\n\n \n Why are some people avoiding them, is the real question.\n \n \nBut hardly comparable to a ulterior motive movie that's about all those evil \"homophobes\" and gay love that can't be. Oh yeah, and it tries to be look like a cowboy movie to do it. Everybody's acting like Brokeback Mountain is just a love story, but obviously it has an agenda behind it when it's a statement about \"homophobia.\"\n\n \n Your mind is so closed and narrow on this. That's a very simplisitic way of looking at it. There are many universal human themes in this movie which so many individuals and critics have enjoyed exploring. I highly doubt it could have won awards and critical acclaim if Brokeback Mountain were merely a soap-box, which you seem to be suggesting it is, without having seen it.",

   "The Evangelical Christian Church Inc. was founded on 1804-JUN-28, in Bourbon County, KY, by Barton Warren Stone, a former Presbyterian minister. They do not officially accept decisions by the early Church Councils, particularly in the third and fourth centuries CE. Those matters are left to individual interpretation. They oppose \"capital punishment, military intervention into foreign disputes, abortion and homosexuality....[They] advise against the use of alcohol and tobacco. Modes of baptism and the frequency of the Lord's Supper are left to the individual churches... Evangelical Christian Churches are congregationally governed, noncreedal and semi-autonomous....The only requirement for every local church is that the [denomination's] Statement of Faith be strictly adhered to and the local church opposes abortion and homosexuality.\" \n \n They publish The Empty Tomb which is available online.\n \n Policy on homosexuality:\n Like almost all Evangelical Christian groups, the The Evangelical Christian Church, Inc. (Christian Disciples) views \"homosexuality\" as a behavior rather than as a sexual orientation. That is: \"homosexuality\" is something that a person does; it is not something that a person is. They differ in this view from gays, lesbians, liberal religious groups, human sexuality researchers and almost all mental health therapists.\n \n A knowledgeable member of the denomination has supplied us with a description of the church's policy towards homosexual behavior:\n [*]The church is \"unalterably opposed to homosexual activity.\" [*] They believe that homosexual behavior is \"inconsistent with New Testament Christianity and that attempts to legitimize such behavior by corrupting the Greek language is inexcusable. It is our belief the Greek language is best understood by the Greeks themselves rather than by non-Greeks who have studied the language. Since the Greek Orthodox Church opposes homosexuality we feel they are correct in terms of accurate Biblical interpretation.\" [*] They note that all ancient Christian churches, such as the Holy Apostolic Assyrian Catholic Church of the East, The Syrian Church, and the Coptic Church, all oppose homosexuality. [*] The Evangelical Christian Church views all homosexual behavior as sinful, whether it is engaged by a person who is single or in a committed relationship. [*] Sexually active homosexuals are welcome to attend church services. However, they are not eligible for \"church membership, for ordination to the Gospel ministry or to hold elective or appointive office.\" [*] The Church condemns \"anything less than love, compassion, kindness and mercy towards the gay and lesbian community. They renounce violence of any kind toward the gay and lesbian community.\" [*] They call for full civil rights in the workplace and equal protection under the law. [*] They do not support, endorse or condone same-sex civil unions. To our knowledge, they are unique among conservative Christian denominations, in that they support the constitutional right of gays and lesbians to marry. [*] The Evangelical Christian Church, however, will not bless, sanction or recognize such unions or marriages. [*] Their church home page has a hyperlink labeled \"Research and Therapy of Homosexuality\" which leads to NARTH, the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality. NARTH is alone among professional mental health organizations in their belief that a person with a homosexual orientation can change their orientation to heterosexuality. They recommend reparative therapy.\n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_eccdc.htm",

   "A majority of churchgoers report hearing about homosexuality from their clergy: 55% of those who attend services at least once or twice a month say their clergy talk about issues related to homosexuality, and 41% say they discuss laws regarding homosexuals. The percentage hearing about laws related to homosexuals is up slightly from 1996, when 36% reported this topic mentioned by clergy. \n \n Among subjects addressed by clergy, homosexuality is about as common as prayer in the schools (58%) and the situation in Iraq (53%), and somewhat less common than abortion (63%). It is a more commonly mentioned topic than either the death penalty (28%) or candidates and elections (26%). And 40% of churchgoers say they have heard about the recent controversy over the Ten Commandments monument in Alabama. \n \n The subject of homosexuality is heard in church much more commonly by white evangelicals than by white mainline Protestants or Catholics. Two-thirds (66%) of white evangelicals say their clergy talk about issues related to homosexuality. This is considerably higher than the incidence in mainline Protestant (36%) or Catholic (44%) churches. Black churchgoers also are much less likely than white evangelicals (42%) to say their clergy discuss the issue. \n \n The vast majority of regular churchgoers who hear about homosexuality in church say the message is a negative rather than a neutral or positive one: overall, 76% say their clergy discourage homosexuality, while 4% say clergy favor acceptance of it; only 16% say their clergy take no position when they speak about the issue.

Arguments used against interracial marriage included that it went against God because they'd be creating a new race that he didn't when they had kids. Let's see, \"it goes against God\" is used against gay marriage too. They said it would make a \"mongrel breed\" and was bad for children. Well, those who argue against gay marriage say they'll make gay kids--the 'mongrel breed' argument--(yeah, and all straight parents raise straight kids) and that it'll confuse the child --the 'bad for kids' arguments. Interracial sex was illegal for a long time. Gay sex was too. People were denied apartment rentals on the grounds that they were an interracial couple.

In both cases \"casual sex\" was better than \"sex with meaning\" as in, a one-night-stand is preferable (to society) than a marriage.

Good to know you guys are ok with that :)\n\n who said Christofascist is for all Christians? It's just for the Jerry Falwell/Pat Robertson/Fred Phelps/John Smid -types. You know, the ones that say \"believe this or die!\" and then harrass you about not being a Christian like them or (Gawd forbid) a Catholic instead of a good Baptist! We all know the Catholics are going to Hell for worshipping Mary and the Saints* instead of Gawd. Then they tell people that they can't have a sense of morality without being a Christian and reading the Bible with very literal readings instead of realizing that practically the whole thing is parables and just meant to teach little lessons, not dictate. They also tell everyone that is Christian and a different denomination that they are wrong and going to Hell. Then they say that even if they're the same denomination, if they are gay they'll go to Hell. Of course, when they lie to someone, Gawd lets them slide because they're tight like that. It's just the other people that are going to Hell, not them of course.\n \n \n \n *They don't worship them. They use them as messengers to God. Lots or Protestants think they do though.",
