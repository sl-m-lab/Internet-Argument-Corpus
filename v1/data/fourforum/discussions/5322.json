   "Nope, nothing to see here. Move along. The Islamization of Europe is proceding apace. By 2025, Europe will be Islamic, the \"Eurabia\" in the book by the same name. \n \n http://www.hooverdigest.org/043/ferguson2.html\n ==========================\n \n The Islamization of French Schools\n Weekly Standard, by Oliver Guitta\n \n Original Article\n \n AN OFFICIAL REPORT DEALING WITH religious expression in French schools has become a must read for anyone interested in the Islamization of France. Written under the auspices of the top national education official, Jean-Pierre Obin, the report was not initially released by the Ministry of Education. But it was leaked on the Internet...two consistent findings: a marked increase in religious expression, especially Muslim expression, in schools; and denial on the part of officials...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Protected/Articles/000/000/005/565uukdg.asp?pg=1",

Anyway the same thing is happening with Latin America and the USA.\nFace it, MM, the French are bound and determined to commit national suicide. We saved their bacon in WWI and WWII, and protected them from the USSR for half a century. Now they are putting their appeasement skills to work in a different way, and may very well succeed this time. :p",

   "Most of that article seems to be making a fuss about very minor things. What the hell is wrong with serving halal meat? What is wrong with people observing Ramadan? What is wrong with people observing hijab? Bullying needs to be tackled, certainly, but the article seems to think there is something wrong with observing religious rules in and of itself. As for \"Jew\" being used as an insult, I don't think that is specific to Muslims, it was used by a significant number at my school, which was 99% white british and largely Christian or non-religious. It's not a good thing, but to blame Muslims for Europe's appalling history of anti-semitism is ridiculous.",

   "And the Southern US is going to become part of Mexico in a couple of decades, The West Coast of Canada will join China in 50 years. A different ethnic makeup of a country is to be expected if you have immigration from non traditional countries.\n \n Why do so many anti Europe Op Ed pieces on one hand decry the low birthrate in Europe and the ageing population. Then in another decry the immigration of non Europeans to Europe, ( of course only muslim immigration is ever mentioned). No mention of Chinese, African or Hindu immigration, and from Canadian experiences the Chinese are the least likely to integrate within Canadian society as a group.\n \n \n It seems some OP ED are just upset that Europe didnt appease the US in its Crusade on the muslim world, to protect the besieged christian nations.",
