Then why are galaxies at the outer rim of our universe dated to be younger than ours which is in the approximate middle? Even cosmological evidence defies the claims of the big bang yet that isn't enough to drop it as a realistic theory. The problems of Big Bang as Origin of Universe with reference to timing of history Mybe this will convince you that intelligent and qualified scientists reject this so called theory for many valid reasons.\n An Open Letter to the Scientific Community\n cosmologystatement.org\n \n (Published in New Scientist, May 22, 2004)\n \n The big bang today relies on a growing number of hypothetical entities, things that we have never observed-- inflation, dark matter and dark energy are the most prominent examples. Without them, there would be a fatal contradiction between the observations made by astronomers and the predictions of the big bang theory. In no other field of physics would this continual recourse to new hypothetical objects be accepted as a way of bridging the gap between theory and observation. It would, at the least, raise serious questions about the validity of the underlying theory.\n \n But the big bang theory can't survive without these fudge factors. Without the hypothetical inflation field, the big bang does not predict the smooth, isotropic cosmic background radiation that is observed, because there would be no way for parts of the universe that are now more than a few degrees away in the sky to come to the same temperature and thus emit the same amount of microwave radiation.\n \n Without some kind of dark matter, unlike any that we have observed on Earth despite 20 years of experiments, big-bang theory makes contradictory predictions for the density of matter in the universe. Inflation requires a density 20 times larger than that implied by big bang nucleosynthesis, the theory's explanation of the origin of the light elements. And without dark energy, the theory predicts that the universe is only about 8 billion years old, which is billions of years younger than the age of many stars in our galaxy.\n \n What is more, the big bang theory can boast of no quantitative predictions that have subsequently been validated by observation. The successes claimed by the theory's supporters consist of its ability to retrospectively fit observations with a steadily increasing array of adjustable parameters, just as the old Earth-centered cosmology of Ptolemy needed layer upon layer of epicycles.\n \n Yet the big bang is not the only framework available for understanding the history of the universe. Plasma cosmology and the steady-state model both hypothesize an evolving universe without beginning or end. These and other alternative approaches can also explain the basic phenomena of the cosmos, including the abundances of light elements, the generation of large-scale structure, the cosmic background radiation, and how the redshift of far-away galaxies increases with distance. They have even predicted new phenomena that were subsequently observed, something the big bang has failed to do.\n \n Supporters of the big bang theory may retort that these theories do not explain every cosmological observation. But that is scarcely surprising, as their development has been severely hampered by a complete lack of funding. Indeed, such questions and alternatives cannot even now be freely discussed and examined. An open exchange of ideas is lacking in most mainstream conferences. Whereas Richard Feynman could say that \"science is the culture of doubt\", in cosmology today doubt and dissent are not tolerated, and young scientists learn to remain silent if they have something negative to say about the standard big bang model. Those who doubt the big bang fear that saying so will cost them their funding.\n \n Even observations are now interpreted through this biased filter, judged right or wrong depending on whether or not they support the big bang. So discordant data on red shifts, lithium and helium abundances, and galaxy distribution, among other topics, are ignored or ridiculed. This reflects a growing dogmatic mindset that is alien to the spirit of free scientific inquiry.\n \n Today, virtually all financial and experimental resources in cosmology are devoted to big bang studies. Funding comes from only a few sources, and all the peer-review committees that control them are dominated by supporters of the big bang. As a result, the dominance of the big bang within the field has become self-sustaining, irrespective of the scientific validity of the theory.\n \n This is also standard operating procedure for the peer review which supports the claims of evolution.\n \n Giving support only to projects within the big bang framework undermines a fundamental element of the scientific method -- the constant testing of theory against observation. Such a restriction makes unbiased discussion and research impossible. To redress this, we urge those agencies that fund work in cosmology to set aside a significant fraction of their funding for investigations into alternative theories and observational contradictions of the big bang. To avoid bias, the peer review committee that allocates such funds could be composed of astronomers and physicists from outside the field of cosmology.\n \n Allocating funding to investigations into the big bang's validity, and its alternatives, would allow the scientific process to determine our most accurate model of the history of the universe.\n \n If you want to sign this statement , please click here\n \n Original Signers | Scientists and Engineers | Independent Researchers | Other Signers\n \n Signed:\n (Institutions for identification only)\n Highlighted names are linked to related web pages\n \n Halton Arp, Max-Planck-Institute Fur Astrophysik (Germany)\n Andre Koch Torres Assis, State University of Campinas (Brazil)\n Yuri Baryshev, Astronomical Institute, St. Petersburg State University (Russia)\n Ari Brynjolfsson, Applied Radiation Industries (USA)\n Hermann Bondi, Churchill College, University of Cambridge (UK)\n Timothy Eastman, Plasmas International (USA)\n Chuck Gallo, Superconix, Inc.(USA)\n Thomas Gold, Cornell University (emeritus) (USA)\n Amitabha Ghosh, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (India)\n Walter J.

   "Really? Then why are galaxies at the outer rim of our universe dated to be younger than ours which is in the approximate middle?\n\n First, our galaxy is NOT in the middle, in fact the universe has no \"outer rim\" and, consequently, also no center.\n \n Second, I'd say they are dated younger, because they ARE younger when we observe them. Let me try to explain.\n \n These galaxies were formed many billions of years ago, but due to the expansion of the universe the light they emitted took a very very long time to reach us. The light of those galaxies that reaches us today, was emitted many billions of years ago, and is \"younger\" then our sun.\n \n As to your list, how many of those are actually physicists? I couldn't find one, though i admitedly skimmed over it. So, we are to take the argument from authority you just made, on the basis of the authority of people who know NOTHING about this stuff? I'd say that counts a s a double fallacy.\n \n the article itself is riddled with flaws, a few which I'll take out and comment on.\n \n \nWithout the hypothetical inflation field, the big bang does not predict the smooth, isotropic cosmic background radiation that is observed, because there would be no way for parts of the universe that are now more than a few degrees away in the sky to come to the same temperature and thus emit the same amount of microwave radiation.\n\n Of course, inflation was comfirmed by wmap.\n \n \nWithout some kind of dark matter, unlike any that we have observed on Earth despite 20 years of experiments, big-bang theory makes contradictory predictions for the density of matter in the universe.\n\n Actually, we CAN observe the effects of dark matter.\n \n \nWhat is more, the big bang theory can boast of no quantitative predictions that have subsequently been validated by observation.\n\n Really? CMBR does not exist?\n \n I'll leave it at that for now.",

First it was shown that many meteorites have ages which cluster around that value, and then it was shown that Earth formed at the same time (within a window of less than 100 million years). Keep in mind that these are radiometric dates: they measure when minerals crystallized from a magma (which occurred as planetary bodies accreted and cooled), not when the elements were formed.\n \n It was well-known even back then that the universe is much older than the solar system. It should not be surprising that our estimates for the age of the universe have drifted around-- it is a much harder thing to constrain and involves totally different techniques.\n\n \n Hi tester, welcome to the forum.

He's not at the location listed for him anymore.\n\n \n Rather than follow penfolds lead and be concerned with the signers of the statement Karl, even though a Plasma Physicist seems eminently qualified to comprehend cosmology science, is there anything specific about the conclusions the 400+ scientists outline which you can prove are incorrect?\n An Open Letter to the Scientific Community\n cosmologystatement.org\n \n (Published in New Scientist, May 22, 2004)\n \n The big bang today relies on a growing number of hypothetical entities, things that we have never observed-- inflation, dark matter and dark energy are the most prominent examples. Without them, there would be a fatal contradiction between the observations made by astronomers and the predictions of the big bang theory. In no other field of physics would this continual recourse to new hypothetical objects be accepted as a way of bridging the gap between theory and observation. It would, at the least, raise serious questions about the validity of the underlying theory.\n \n But the big bang theory can't survive without these fudge factors. Without the hypothetical inflation field, the big bang does not predict the smooth, isotropic cosmic background radiation that is observed, because there would be no way for parts of the universe that are now more than a few degrees away in the sky to come to the same temperature and thus emit the same amount of microwave radiation.\n \n Without some kind of dark matter, unlike any that we have observed on Earth despite 20 years of experiments, big-bang theory makes contradictory predictions for the density of matter in the universe. Inflation requires a density 20 times larger than that implied by big bang nucleosynthesis, the theory's explanation of the origin of the light elements. And without dark energy, the theory predicts that the universe is only about 8 billion years old, which is billions of years younger than the age of many stars in our galaxy.\n \n What is more, the big bang theory can boast of no quantitative predictions that have subsequently been validated by observation. The successes claimed by the theory's supporters consist of its ability to retrospectively fit observations with a steadily increasing array of adjustable parameters, just as the old Earth-centered cosmology of Ptolemy needed layer upon layer of epicycles.\n \n Yet the big bang is not the only framework available for understanding the history of the universe. Plasma cosmology and the steady-state model both hypothesize an evolving universe without beginning or end. These and other alternative approaches can also explain the basic phenomena of the cosmos, including the abundances of light elements, the generation of large-scale structure, the cosmic background radiation, and how the redshift of far-away galaxies increases with distance. They have even predicted new phenomena that were subsequently observed, something the big bang has failed to do.\n \n Supporters of the big bang theory may retort that these theories do not explain every cosmological observation. But that is scarcely surprising, as their development has been severely hampered by a complete lack of funding. Indeed, such questions and alternatives cannot even now be freely discussed and examined. An open exchange of ideas is lacking in most mainstream conferences. Whereas Richard Feynman could say that \"science is the culture of doubt\", in cosmology today doubt and dissent are not tolerated, and young scientists learn to remain silent if they have something negative to say about the standard big bang model. Those who doubt the big bang fear that saying so will cost them their funding.\n \n Even observations are now interpreted through this biased filter, judged right or wrong depending on whether or not they support the big bang. So discordant data on red shifts, lithium and helium abundances, and galaxy distribution, among other topics, are ignored or ridiculed. This reflects a growing dogmatic mindset that is alien to the spirit of free scientific inquiry.\n \n Today, virtually all financial and experimental resources in cosmology are devoted to big bang studies. Funding comes from only a few sources, and all the peer-review committees that control them are dominated by supporters of the big bang. As a result, the dominance of the big bang within the field has become self-sustaining, irrespective of the scientific validity of the theory.\n \n This is also standard operating procedure for the peer review which supports the claims of evolution.\n \n Giving support only to projects within the big bang framework undermines a fundamental element of the scientific method -- the constant testing of theory against observation. Such a restriction makes unbiased discussion and research impossible. To redress this, we urge those agencies that fund work in cosmology to set aside a significant fraction of their funding for investigations into alternative theories and observational contradictions of the big bang. To avoid bias, the peer review committee that allocates such funds could be composed of astronomers and physicists from outside the field of cosmology.\n \n Allocating funding to investigations into the big bang's validity, and its alternatives, would allow the scientific process to determine our most accurate model of the history of the universe.",

   "Perhaps you aren't confused in terms of your intended meaning (i.e., that estimates for the age of the universe have varied in your lifetime), but in terms of what you actually write you are indeed confused. \n \n I don't mean to give you a hard time about this, but I would like readers to understand the difference. Perhaps it was unintended, but to say the scientifically accepted age of Earth has fluctuated appreciably in your lifetime is historically not true, obfuscates the well-established science of radiometric dating, and is disrespectful to the scientists who pioneered this work (most notably, Claire Patterson).\n \n You are conflating ages of the universe with ages of Earth (and our solar system). In a relative sense, it is clear that the universe came into existence at some point prior to the formation of our solar system. The exact timing for that is a matter of cosmology.\n \n In terms of Earth, however, we have actual samples of rock, and since the 1940's we've been able to date them using radiometric methods. This is a matter of geochemistry.\n \n As I mentioned previously, radiometric techniques were used to show that Earth formed formed about 4.5 billion years ago. The error bar on that number is on the order of tens of millions of years, and accordingly new values have altered the accepted age at a digit less significant that what is shown when writing it as 4.5 billion years.\n \n Scientifically, the value has not changed in your lifetime (since the 1950's), and it is factually incorrect to say otherwise. It is of course possible that a teacher gave you bad information, or that you're confusing some historical background that was conveyed to you as the at-the-time accepted value (e.g. early and demonstrably flawed methods like conductive cooling or salt concentrations in the oceans), but seriously: this number (i.e., the age of Earth) has not been fluctuating during your lifetime in terms of what is accepted by scientists!!\n \n By all means, feel free to clarify that your intended meaning dealt with the age of the universe (which seems like a fair and reasonable point to raise), but what you actually wrote was the age of Earth, and that is definitively not true (in your lifetime).\n \n The oldest general physical science book I happen to have on my shelf is Physical Science, 2nd ed. by Donald S. Allen and Richard J. Ordway, 1968. \"Earth, age of\" is listed in the index, and the text states, \"The age of the Earth is apparently about 4 to 5 billion years old\". And, this is a general textbook intended for students... again, the actual quantitative value of 4.55 was established in the 1950's.\n \n I'm now curious to browse the shelves of my local library, and I hope you do the same.\n \n \n \n \n \nHi tester, welcome to the forum.
