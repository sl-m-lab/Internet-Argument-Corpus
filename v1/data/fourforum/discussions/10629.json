   "I joined this site a few days ago, and I dutifully made my first post on the \"introductions\" section. I said my main forum interest was \"sweet, beautiful, atheism\". \n \n I was trying to be brief, but I wanted to unambiguously state my position. Lo and behold, \"jim's trucking\" kindly invited me to start a thread about my seemingly odd choice of words! So here it is. I'm no writer but I'll put it as best I can.\n \n As a starting point, I'll quote 4forums user \"JPSatre12\", who also responded to my introduction. \nPersonally, I don't see anything sweet about being Godless, but that's just me.\n JPSatre12 makes it clear he doesn't understand the experience of non-belief (specifically what it means to, without reservation, call yourself godless), so I think it's important for me to first note that I actually do understand the beauty of religion. Like many atheists I've been through my varying degrees of religiousness, and although I never really immersed myself in it, I can remember its attractiveness. Committed Christians I knew (and other religious people for that matter), were genuinely happy. And at times, although I believed less and less, I wanted to believe more and more.\n What people like JPSatre12 never seem to understand is - You can't make yourself believe.\n \n The religious experience for me was one of uncertainty, and religion definitely raised more questions than it answered. So I moved away from the multitude of religious claims, and towards agnosticism. When I read more about the natural universe and the complete lack of evidence for even so much as an uninvolved creator, I finally killed my god. To say the least, it was like a breath of fresh air, and my mind was free. No doubt, no guesswork. No unproven, \"have faith\" god or \"have faith\" anything else. \n \n So I guess the real beauty of either position is at least the suspension of doubt, as the human mind gravitates to a position it can feel sure in. Is there certainty in atheism? Religious people are completely certain about their god, but what can atheists actually claim to know for sure? For me it's this:\n \n I know there is no reliable evidence that any god exists.\n \n That's a beautiful certainty.\n \n So I accept my life for what it is, and that's no small thing. When I step outside my door at night and look at the sky, I know I'm part of the universe. I'm made of the same stuff - the same elements - this stuff having been acted upon by amazing and truly awe inspiring natural processes. As a living human being, I feel incredibly privileged to be at the end of this line. And when I see a bird, or a dog, or a spider, I know I'm basically the same thing. Now that's beautiful. Atheism has given me the truest respect for life.\n \n So say what you want. Say that being godless means to be cold, evil, or amoral. That, of course, shows you don't understand. But for me, and for a growing number of people who've one against the \"will to believe\"; to be godless is to be truly free. A man without a god is a man indeed: he is everything unto himself.",

   "I said my main forum interest was \"sweet, beautiful, atheism\". \n\n \n There are some things one can't expect those who hanker helplessly after celestial paternalism to understand, and that is the austere beauty of naturalism, and the calm satisfaction of trying to know the universe as it is, rather than projecting one's wishes on it, and being eternally disappointed.\n \n \nWhat people like JPSatre12 never seem to understand is - You can't make yourself believe.\n\n \n You certainly can't, at least not when there is zero evidence to support a postulated belief. I have no problem believing that 2+2=4, but Christianity eventually stretched my credulity beyond breaking point.\n \n \nSo say what you want.

They often use these falsehoods to justify their beliefs to themselves. They miss the grandeur in a godless view of life, where nature stands by itself without any celestial conjurers to make it work. They miss the spiritual fulfillment of an atheist perspective, and believe that their particular theist one is the only one that can possibly satisfy a person. Without that belief, they'd be lost.\n \n As Darwin said in another context, there is grandeur in this view of life, with its many powers... that is not to assert that evolution disproves theism, but that a vision of the universe without a god can be very satisfying and awesome to a prepared mind.",

It's just an example of the calming effect it can have just by being available in the neighborhood.\n\n \n Come to think of it, isn't that why Marx described it as the \"opium of the masses\"? I'm not sure Marx was completely right about that, of course, I just think it would be interesting to see if one could do a factorial analysis between religiosity and traits such as lawlessness or poverty, and what correlations it would show. The recent Pew international poll I referenced elsewhere did correlate religiosity with national wealth among modern nations, and that showed a complex inverse correlation. Tricky trying to interpret what it might mean, however.\n \n \nI think I've already gone on record as saying that religion is a source of divisiveness. However, lack of it appears to enable anarchy.\n\n \n On the other hand, maybe anarchy simply destroys the stability necessary for religious organisations to flourish. Church and state power have frequently gone together, and therefore have frequently been attacked together. And some of the most stable and orderly industrialised nations are also among the least religious. I think you may find better correlations between stability, and relative wealth or poverty.\n \n For example, the US is arguably the most religiose nation among industrialised states, yet has the highest per capita rates of murder and incarceration of any. It seems to me that simple examples aren't going to tell us much.",

If asked about my religious beliefs, I regard myself as having none, as being an atheist... I only would bother to call myself an atheist if someone asked...\nMe too. And yes I was being a bit tongue in cheek, but there's something sincere behind that. If you don't \"view atheism as anything worth having much of an opinion about\", you probably - (probably) - haven't had to escape religion. But (IMO) even if you're a \"dyed in the wool atheist from birth\", you should have an opinion about atheism's lack of affect on the stranglehold of religion around the world. \n...I don't have any feelings about the lack of belief - it is an absence of something, after all, and I can't attribute something to a nothing.\nFair enough. But if you had a headache for twenty years you'd certainly have feelings about your lack of said headache once it was gone. Or if the majority of other people had permanent headaches you'd count yourself fortunate not to have one, and if such a state had a name (say \"nonachyism\"), you'd say it was great! \nI share your and other's joy and awe and wonder about the natural world, but I don't consider that as atheism in any way.\nBut it's so much more enhanced when you realise you are part of the natural world, and not just some vessel for an eternal soul waiting to be done with this life to get to the real prize.\n I suppose I just want to make this point to counter the idea that atheism is another creed.\nI know where you're coming from, but that's letting the religious get their way as well. We're \"damned if we do, damned if we don't\"! We're blocked from saying anything positive about atheism because it gives the religious this ammunition. Of course they're firing blanks, but it still makes a very disruptive noise. \n I also don't agree with the certainty part. For one, I don't have any and I don't think anyone else should be dead certain about very much. This closes the mind. I think there is beauty in uncertainty. It keeps us open and inquiring and able to retain a childlike curiosity and wonder.\nAh, but don't confuse certainty with dogmatic belief. There's a clear and important distinction between saying \"I know there is no reliable evidence that any god exists\", and saying \"I know there never could be any reliable evidence that any god exists\".

If you don't believe something exists, you believe it doesn't exist. You can't really have it both ways. I say \"I know there is no reliable evidence that any god exists\".

I hope you're still reading, because I'd sincerely like to know (and discuss) why you think it's a bad thing.\n Others view their atheism as lack of any belief at all.\nIMO that's more agnosticism than anything else.

I think it's completely insidious in the way it replicates from generation to generation, by planting fear in children, who then become parents who really think they're saving their own childrens' souls.

If the fish never really became a mammal and the mammal never became the bird and the ape never became the man then your faith is in vain and your religion of evolution is nothing more than a false cult of lies which I have been saying for years now.\nmore talkorigins, anyone?\n \n There are many transitional fossils. The only way that the claim of their absence may be remotely justified, aside from ignoring the evidence completely, is to redefine \"transitional\" as referring to a fossil that is a direct ancestor of one organism and a direct descendant of another. However, direct lineages are not required; they could not be verified even if found. What a transitional fossil is, in keeping with what the theory of evolution predicts, is a fossil that shows a mosaic of features from an older and more recent organism. \n \n \n Transitional fossils may coexist with gaps. We do not expect to find finely detailed sequences of fossils lasting for millions of years. Nevertheless, we do find several fine gradations of fossils between species and genera, and we find many other sequences between higher taxa that are still very well filled out. \n \n The following are fossil transitions between species and genera: \n \n \n Human ancestry. There are many fossils of human ancestors, and the differences between species are so gradual that it is not always clear where to draw the lines between them. \n \n \n The horns of titanotheres (extinct Cenozoic mammals) appear in progressively larger sizes, from nothing to prominence. Other head and neck features also evolved. These features are adaptations for head-on ramming analogous to sheep behavior (Stanley 1974). \n \n \n A gradual transitional fossil sequence connects the foraminifera Globigerinoides trilobus and Orbulina universa (Pearson et al. 1997). O. universa, the later fossil, features a spherical test surrounding a \"Globigerinoides-like\" shell, showing that a feature was added, not lost. The evidence is seen in all major tropical ocean basins. Several intermediate morphospecies connect the two species, as may be seen in the figure included in Lindsay (1997). \n \n \n The fossil record shows transitions between species of Phacops (a trilobite; Phacops rana is the Pennsylvania state fossil; Eldredge 1972; 1974; Strapple 1978). \n \n \n Planktonic forminifera (Malmgren et al. 1984). This is an example of punctuated gradualism. A ten-million-year foraminifera fossil record shows long periods of stasis and other periods of relatively rapid but still gradual morphologic change. \n \n \n Fossils of the diatom Rhizosolenia are very common (they are mined as diatomaceous earth), and they show a continuous record of almost two million years which includes a record of a speciation event (Miller 1999, 44-45). \n \n \n Lake Turkana mollusc species (Lewin 1981). \n \n \n Cenozoic marine ostracodes (Cronin 1985). \n \n \n The Eocene primate genus Cantius (Gingerich 1976, 1980, 1983). \n \n \n Scallops of the genus Chesapecten show gradual change in one \"ear\" of their hinge over about 13 million years. The ribs also change (Pojeta and Springer 2001; Ward and Blackwelder 1975). \n \n \n Gryphaea (coiled oysters) become larger and broader but thinner and flatter during the Early Jurassic (Hallam 1968). \n \n The following are fossil transitionals between families, orders, and classes: \n \n \n Human ancestry. Australopithecus, though its leg and pelvis bones show it walked upright, had a bony ridge on the forearm, probably vestigial, indicative of knuckle walking (Richmond and Strait 2000). \n \n \n Dinosaur-bird transitions. \n \n \n Haasiophis terrasanctus is a primitive marine snake with well-developed hind limbs. Although other limbless snakes might be more ancestral, this fossil shows a relationship of snakes with limbed ancestors (Tchernov et al. 2000). Pachyrhachis is another snake with legs that is related to Haasiophis (Caldwell and Lee 1997). \n \n \n The jaws of mososaurs are also intermediate between snakes and lizards. Like the snake's stretchable jaws, they have highly flexible lower jaws, but unlike snakes, they do not have highly flexible upper jaws. Some other skull features of mososaurs are intermediate between snakes and primitive lizards (Caldwell and Lee 1997; Lee et al. 1999; Tchernov et al. 2000). \n \n \n Transitions between mesonychids and whales. \n \n \n Transitions between fish and tetrapods. \n \n \n Transitions from condylarths (a kind of land mammal) to fully aquatic modern manatees. In particular, Pezosiren portelli is clearly a sirenian, but its hind limbs and pelvis are unreduced (Domning 2001a, 2001b). \n \n \n Runcaria, a Middle Devonian plant, was a precursor to seed plants. It had all the qualities of seeds except a solid seed coat and a system to guide pollen to the seed (Gerrienne et al. 2004). \n \n \n A bee, Melittosphex burmensis, from Early Cretaceous amber, has primitive characteristics expected from a transition between crabronid wasps and extant bees (Poinar and Danforth 2006). \n \n The following are fossil transitionals between kingdoms and phyla: \n \n \n The Cambrian fossils Halkiera and Wiwaxia have features that connect them with each other and with the modern phyla of Mollusca, Brachiopoda, and Annelida. In particular, one species of halkieriid has brachiopod-like shells on the dorsal side at each end. This is seen also in an immature stage of the living brachiopod species Neocrania. It has setae identical in structure to polychaetes, a group of annelids. Wiwaxia and Halkiera have the same basic arrangement of hollow sclerites, an arrangement that is similar to the chaetae arrangement of polychaetes. The undersurface of Wiwaxia has a soft sole like a mollusk's foot, and its jaw looks like a mollusk's mouth. Aplacophorans, which are a group of primitive mollusks, have a soft body covered with spicules similar to the sclerites of Wiwaxia (Conway Morris 1998, 185-195). \n \n \n Cambrian and Precambrain fossils Anomalocaris and Opabinia are transitional between arthropods and lobopods. \n \n \n An ancestral echinoderm has been found that is intermediate between modern echinoderms and other deuterostomes (Shu et al. 2004). \n Links:\n Hunt, Kathleen. 1994-1997.

   "We do not expect to find finely detailed sequences of fossils lasting for millions of years.\n\n \n Lies, all lies. And totally unprovable mind you. A transitional species would be the fossil of a fish with actual legs. A fish with lungs and fur. Or a mammal with gils. Give me a transitional animal that we can study. After all, it took hundreds of thousands of years or longer for any species to make the smallest leap from one change to another, and many incremental changes before the species change was complete. That's what evo teaches anyway. So with such a slow process of change at each level of evolution, why don't we have real examples that those transitional species even existed?\n \n And you say we don't even expect to find transitional species?

   "Here's more on the religion of atheism.\n \n The Religion Of Atheism\n \n By Rev. Bill McGinnis, Editor\n \n INTERNET DAILY CHAPEL\n A person's religion is the sum total of his beliefs about God and the supernatural. Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are the three largest \"monotheistic\" religions, with belief one God, Creator Of The Universe.\n \n Some religions are \"polytheistic,\" with belief in many gods, each with different functions.\n \n Atheism is the religion whose belief about God is that there is no God.\n \n Some Atheists, for their own political reasons, assert that Atheism is not a religion but instead is the total absence of religion. This allows them to spread their Atheistic beliefs freely in societies which insist on \"separation of church and state.\"\n \n But this is like saying that \"black,\" (which physicists define as the total absence of color) is not a color. The car I drive is a big, old Chevrolet, whose color is black. In common practice throughout the world, \"black\" is understood to be a color, despite the technical definition of the physicists. Likewise, \"Atheism\" is a religion, despite any technical definitions to the contrary.\n \n If black is a color, then Atheism is a religion.\n \n If Atheism is a religion, then it must be subject to the same legal restrictions imposed by governments on all other religions. In particular, in the United States, the teaching of Atheism must be prohibited wherever the teaching of Christianity is prohibited.\n \n But where is Atheism being taught? Atheism is being taught, by default, in all places where other religions cannot be taught, particularly in the public schools.\n \n When the State mandates that the Theory of Evolution be taught as fact, that is establishing the religion of Atheism, because the Theory of Evolution asserts that all life forms are created not by God, but by pre-existing natural processes. This is pure Atheism! If we are not created by God, then there might as well be no God, for all the difference He makes.\n \n The mere fact that many scientists are Atheists does not entitle them to establish Atheism as our State Religion!\n \n When the State prohibits free discussion of God in the classroom, that is establishing the religion of Atheism. Wherever the State permits Atheistic ideas to be spread but prohibits Theistic ideas, that is establishing the religion of Atheism.\n \n Therefore I urge you to understand clearly in your mind that Atheism is a religion, just as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are religions. And any restrictions placed on Christianity, Judaism, or Islam must also be placed on Atheism. Atheism must not be allowed to slip through its little loophole any longer, by pretending it is not a religion.\n \n Blessings to you in the name of the One God, Creator of the Universe.\n \n http://www.InternetDailyChapel.org",

   "Rev. Jim Jones\n \n How very much I've tried my best to give you a good life. But in spite of all of my trying a handful of our people, with their lies, have made our lives impossible. There's no way to detach ourselves from what's happened today. \n \n Not only are we in a compound situation, not only are there those who have left and committed the betrayal of the century, some have stolen children from others, and they are in pursuit right now to kill them because they stole their children. And we are sitting here waiting on a powder keg. \n \n I don't think it is what we want to do with our babies--I don't think that's what we had in mind to do with our babies. It is said by the greatest of prophets from time immemorial: \"No man may take my life from me; I lay my life down.\" So to sit here and wait for the catastrophe that's going to happen on that airplane--it's going to be a catastrophe. It almost happened here. Almost happened when the congressman was nearly killed here. You can't steal people's children. You can't take off with people's children without expecting a violent reaction. And that's not so unfamiliar to us either--even if we were Judeo-Christian--if we weren't Communists. The world (inaudible) suffers violence, and the violent shall take it by force. If we can't live in peace, then let's die in peace. (Applause.) \n \n We've been so betrayed. We have been so terribly betrayed. (Music and singing) But we've tried and as (inaudible) ... if this only works one day it was worthwhile. (Applause.) Thank you. \n \n Now what's going to happen here in a matter of a few minutes is that one of those people on that plane is going to shoot the pilot--I know that. I didn't plan it, but I know it's going to happen. They're gonna shoot that pilot and down comes that plane into the jungle. And we had better not have any of our children left when it's over because they'll parachute in here on us. \n \n I'm going to be just as plain as I know how to tell you. I've never lied to you. I never have lied to you. I know that's what's gonna happen. That's what he intends to do, and he will do it. He'll do it.1 \n \n What's with being so bewildered with many, many pressures on my brain, seeing all these people behave so treasonous--there was too much for me to put together, but I now know what he was telling me. And it'll happen. If the plane gets in the air even.2 \n \n So my opinion is that you be kind to children and be kind to seniors and take the potion like they used to take in ancient Greece and step over quietly because we are not committing suicide; it's a revolutionary act. We can't go back; they won't leave us alone. They're now going back to tell more lies, which means more congressmen. And there's no way, no way we can survive.",

A fish with lungs and fur. Or a mammal with gils. - Archangel\n\n It's really nice of you to re-list the order in which transitions would logically take place. A fish with lungs and fur might actually prove God did it! Why on earth would a species evolve that way?\nGive me a transitional animal that we can study.\nNeotenic axolotls have gills and lungs. How's that?\n And you say we don't even expect to find transitional species?\nNo, I believe the article says\n We do not expect to find finely detailed sequences of fossils lasting for millions of years.\nThis is because of the relatively infrequent nature of fossilisation, and the migration of species as they evolve. (Fossils often must be collected from all over a continent to find the transitions.)\n That's why I waste my time attempting to reason with you atheists, not because I hate you, because I don't. But because I pity you and the lies you have been so brainwashed to believe.\nApart from stating the fact that your idea of \"reasoning with people\" differs greatly from mine, I want to say you have returned to the original theme of this thread. We actually both feel the same about each other. We both feel the other has been brainwashed with lies. You're sure if I could believe what you believe, that I would be happy. I feel the same way about the improbability of you ever embracing rationalism. Where the real difference comes in, is that I will acknowledge you're right about how I would feel if I was completely religious. I'd feel just as good about it as you do. I doubt that you, on the other hand, would ever admit you could be happy as an atheist.",

   "Atheism is a belief system not because of the lack of belief in God but because it still contains a belief. That belief is that of 100% self importance.\n\n \n If absence of belief is a belief in itself, then I suppose you could call atheism a belief. However, it need be no more of a belief than any opinion about anything at all. At minimum, atheism is just that: an opinion.\n \n It would be an error, however, to call atheism a belief on a par with religious belief. (And it's a vastly entertaining irony for a religious believer to denounce atheism because it, too, is supposedly a \"belief\"! What does that say about the justification of his own \"belief\"? \"Oh!\" sneers the theistic believer, \"atheism is 'just' a belief! Therefore it should be discounted!\" Huh?) This is deliberate equivocation of two rather different meanings of the word \"belief\", in order to bring the atheist down -- and I use the word \"down\" intentionally -- to the level of a theistic believer.\n \n Atheism is the absence of a belief in the absence of evidence or good reason to hold a belief; as such, it is not remarkable. One might as well call the opinion that there is no orbiting teapot a belief. It's a reasonable position not to believe in something when one sees no reason to. \n \n Religious faith is a positive belief in a deity despite the lack of evidence for that deity, though the religious believer might offer reasons -- reasons unconvincing to an atheist -- for his or her belief. These are very different forms of belief, and to call one the equivalent of the other seems an attempt to obscure an important distinction.",

Now I ask you, what the HELL does it matter what the HELL I called it, as long as you know what it is (or can at least you can look it up, too).\n \n TIME TO UP YOUR MEDS. emoticon_mad\n\n \n A tenth grade education? Why am I not surprised. That explains why you swallow this evo dung, because it makes you feel smart and enlightened. It is the most popular form of intellectual masturbation for the uninformed and pseudo intellectual today; not to mention the religion of the Natural Man. And here's a clue for you buddy, don't believe everything you read on the internet. Try using common sense before swallowing this tripe and if you want to exercise your common sense muscle, go back and reread all of my posts and try to answer all of my questions objectively. You know, those questions that you and every one of your compadres have completely ignored and not attempted to directly answer at all.",

Well, while Aristotle has a point, it isn't much of one, and you guys take it a lot further than a First Cause, and dress it up in all sorts of human characteristics.

Doesn't it make you even a little bit suspicious?\n \n It makes me feel that religions just project human feelings on to the universe, and on to invented deities.

But it is arguable whether religious believers really \"look to god\" for their guidance, either, or whether they put basic moral rules that humanity has evolved, through nature or nurture, into the mouths of their gods as justifications or rationalisations for why they follow such rules.\n \n And it is true that atheists cannot rationalise their following moral rules by appealing to higher authority, so we appeal to reason and our common humanity instead. That doesn't seem to me to be particularly inward turning, at least no more than that of believers who simply cite their god as an authority for their evolved morality. Yet despite core similarities between all moral codes, different gods have decreed different behaviours moral, which leads one to conclude that people project what they want on their deity, and call it the will of god.\n \n \nFor whatever it's worth, I think it is important to point out that religion and morality are not necessarily the same concept, and not necessarily dependent on one another, depending on the situation.

Some bells and whistles will differ, depending on the culture. Religions or secular philosophies are probably at best rationalisations for behaviour patterns that are natural for humans to adopt (with due variance owing to circumstances: for example, murder and incest taboos are pretty universal, and the vast majority of societies have rules distinguishing licit from illicit sexual activity, but cannibalism, while usually tabooed, is sometimes culturally integrated). However, I don't deny the power of such religions or philosophies to bend behaviour patterns one way or another within certain constraints, i.e. to reinforce or inhibit certain behaviours. Cultural flexibility -- within limits -- is one of the hallmarks of human civilisation, but I suspect there are only a limited number of ways of building successful societies.\n \n The issue atheists have with religiously based morality is not that reason never enters it under any circumstances, but that because it's based on arbitrary authority, there's a frequent risk reason can be excluded if it conflicts with that authority, which is seen to be divine and inviolable. (The morality of homosexuality or contraception are excellent examples. The Catholic church has to twist reason into sophistry to justify their versions of morality there.

Atheists have far fewer problems, and are generally content to leave such decisions to individuals.)\n\n \n But what you are leaving out is that if the religions is correctly followed and being involved in, then the \"exclusion\" of reason won't typically have a harmful effect anyway. (Which in turn makes it a morality of reason!) For instance, with your contraception issue, the RCC teaches against contraception, but also heavily emphasizes the importance of marriage and family. Frequently the argument against the RCC's stance on contraceptives is something like \"single people or teenagers may end up pregnant or get STDs\" or something like that. Well, yeah, if you ignore the Church's admonitions to form families and marry rather than sleeping around and being promiscuous, then yeah. Duh! That's a case where the church's teaching is NOT being followed, rather than when it is.\n \n Yes, homosexual behavior is a much harder issue.

   " \n So I accept my life for what it is, and that's no small thing. When I step outside my door at night and look at the sky, I know I'm part of the universe. I'm made of the same stuff - the same elements - this stuff having been acted upon by amazing and truly awe inspiring natural processes. As a living human being, I feel incredibly privileged to be at the end of this line. And when I see a bird, or a dog, or a spider, I know I'm basically the same thing. Now that's beautiful. Atheism has given me the truest respect for life.\n \n So say what you want. Say that being godless means to be cold, evil, or amoral. That, of course, shows you don't understand.

(Hope you're reading).\n \n \nYou seem to suggest that being a Christian, one is denied the ability to appreciate nature and it's living beings. That may appear to be an effect but, the appreciation, or lack of is a matter of choice.\nI know Christians can have an appreciation of nature, and I don't suggest for one second that being a Christian (or a person of any religion for that matter) means you're \"denied that ability.\" What I'm saying is that as an atheist, I personally feel an enhanced sense of awe about it, because I recognise that I am thoroughly and completely a part of it in a purely physical sense. Now, what is that compared to knowing I'm part of \"God's\" plan, and that I personally experience his love, and that I'm guaranteed ecstatic life everlasting? Well, maybe not much, but I can't believe anything without evidence, although for a long time I tried. Once I let go of my wishful thinking, I had a fantastic experience I daresay you wouldn't understand. That's what I'm tyring to get across here. You can say to an atheist, \"You can't understand the personal joy of being religious\". They probably can't, but they'd be dishonest if they said they didn't see its appeal to the people who do experience it. I want to impart that understanding to you in reverse, because it's disappointing that religious people always see atheism through their Hell Filter. \n \n \nA confident Christian will not attempt to sway you from your choice. They will respect your choice... They generally will attempt to make you aware of the options (my emphasis) available to you however. They are compelled by love to do so out of concern for your eternal being.\nPlease read the following carefully. If you take nothing else from this discourse, then understand only the following.\n \n ITS. NOT. A. CHOICE.\n \n You really don't get it. What on earth can you CHOOSE to believe? You believe what makes the most sense to you - it's not your CHOICE. Imagine we're looking out my window at my empty yard, and I tell you there's a spaceship on my lawn. Is it the case you can simply CHOOSE to believe me even though you don't see a spaceship? Have I given you a choice? Sorry, but you guys really annoy me. It's like you're saying \"Ah well, he knows God exists but...\" BUT WHAT? But \"he chooses not to believe it?\" That can't possibly make sense!\n \n I haven't taken an option, gman, any more than you have. Think about it.\nBeing the thoughtful individual that you are you can not dismiss the possibilities that exist nor simply dismiss them because you can not see or touch them.\nI don't need to see or touch anything. I'd believe if I simply felt (like many religious people do) that God was \"living in my heart.\" I just couldn't manage to hypnotise myself into it.\n As for possibilities, well geeze anything is possible, but possibilities are possibilities. It's possible tarot cards are real and the universe is a fairy's f*rt. \n Likelihoods supersede possibilities. There are infinite possibilities, but likelihoods narrow the field. I listen to the possibilities, but I consider the likelihoods.\nIt's not what you convince yourself about yourself that makes you relevant.\nThat's because you don't determine your own relevance. I guess we agree here. And here - \nAwe is simply a bonus that comes from being a human.\nIsn't it?",

   "Indeed, and in my experience, most religious people are the same way. But I think what Steeeeve may be saying (and he can correct me if I'm wrong) is that because you believe God doesn't even exist, you can't exactly look to God for any moral guidance. I think he's looking at this from a oneself-versus-God thing, in terms of what people turn to, and \"oneself\" would include doing the things you're talking about. I doubt he was trying to make the case that you can't turn to other people, scientists, etc.\n\n \n But the believer has to make the EXACT same choices! Either way you slice it, it comes down to individual choice. Ultimately, every individual must choose what they ascribe their morality to, whether you choose God or not is still a choice being made by \"oneself\".\n \n An atheist (agnostic) can reference all of the things I've listed - concrete, verifiable things.\n \n A believer turns to God - an abstract, supernatural, unproveable concept (\"being\" if you're a believer) as the basis and ultimate authority for all morality. \n \n And from that, the believer has the nerve to tell me that my morality has no basis or is \"selfish\"? Try to imagine how that appears to someone who believes that \"God\" is a concept created by man.\n \n \nFor whatever it's worth, I think it is important to point out that religion and morality are not necessarily the same concept, and not necessarily dependent on one another, depending on the situation. You do realise that reason is also why many religious people know better than to harm others, right? I hope you're not one of these folks that think religion and reason are somehow inversely proportional. See, while I know that God doesn't want me to harm people, I also know it's the correct thing from the standpoint of reason. So religion and reason compliment in this case, rather contradict. The ol' argument atheists sometimes make against religion that it's bad because people only base their morality on \"'cause-god-wants-me-to\" just isn't realistic for most any religious person I've ever known.\n\n \n That may be so jyoshu, but if you were pressed, does your morality ultimately come from your ability to reason, or does it come from God? No weaseling, pick one or the other. In reality, you don't have a choice.\n \n Your answer to that question defines you, and where your ultimate loyalty resides.\n \n For the record, I don't think reason and religion are inversely proportional for the majority of religious people on the majority of topics. However, I think this board is a prime example of just how inversely proportional they can be at times when the right topic is being discussed.

Nothing could be further from the truth and that proof is evident on every debate on this forum regarding what is acceptable lifestyles right here in America in this generation.\n\n \n Not sure where to go on this bit. Some grammatical inaccuracy.\n \n You certainly don't limit yourself to lifestyles in America for this generation. You seem to think that your moral code should apply to everyone. I'm not sure why you refer to a prism of rightiousness, but it is true that both christian and atheist morals are a personal choice rather than divine verses selfish.\n \n \nLet us recap our differences for your consideration and then tell me if I am exaggerating at all.\n \n Believers in Christ condemn the ACT of homosexuality as a moral sin and you atheists call us bigots for it.\n\n This is not true. There are many christians who don't regard homosexuality as a moral sin. I have even quoted the words of 'your' Lord and Saviour with regards to his views on the matter. They aren't in tune with your views. \nWe condemn incest and bestiality and you call us old fashioned and uptight sexually.\n Do atheists not condemn incest and bestiality? Could you give an example or is this just another lie on your part? \nWe condemn premarital sex as irresponsible and dangerous due to the epidemic of STDs infecting our young people, and for that we are called judgmental and controlling.\nIs this line also drawn purely along a christian/non-christian border? Another lie/exaggeration of your part. \nWe are in favor of the death penalty for murderers and child rapists while you think that is cruel and unusual punishment.\n Have you never seen that commandment that says, 'Thou shalt not kill'? And do all atheists think that these criminals should get away with it? Or all christians think they should be strung up? Another line you are drawing that simply doesn't exist. \n Yet you condone aborting innocent unborn children and consider us control freaks who are attempting to dominate women for expecting them, not their unborn children to pay for their irresponsible actions by having the baby they conceived by their own irresponsible actions.\n Yet another line you're drawing that certainly isn't along a christian/non-christian border.\n \n \nAnd who can post a link that proves that of the 13,000 plus murders that take place in the USA every year that it is born again church going believers who are committing them, or is it in fact unbelievers who have no spiritual lives at all to speak of who are causing the chaos that runs so rampant in our communities throughout America? \n\n Just to throw this one back, do you have a link that shows that all these murderers are godless unbelievers who are bereft of any christian moral code? I thought not. Another baseless implication.\n \nSo by what standard do you presume to say that we are on equal footing morally as atheists and believers? As I see it, atheists live by the moral code that if it feels good do it; as long as what you do doesn't interfere with what feels good to me. If we have learned anything as believers in Christ, it's that that is a recipe for chaos which is precisely what this World is experiencing right now, yet your side will still debate to the death that your narcissistic amoral hedonistic World view is right and that we believers are uptight controlling bullies because we fight for the innocent and for concrete moral values that are time tested and proven to support a healthy Society.\n\n The standard by which I presume to argue that we are all on an equal footing is that not all christians have the same moral opinions, which is very strange if they all believe in the word of god and its infallibiility. The moral code of many atheists is very similar to that of christians, with the obvious difference that they are not seeking some devine reward for their actions, or fearing some divine punishment for their crimes.\n \n If you see it that all atheists live by a code of 'if it feels good do it', then you obviously have very poor eyesight indeed. And out of interest, does your condemnation of someone's moral code extend to non-christians of some other religious persuation? Surely, if they aren't blessed by your 'one true god' then they must be just as damned as the rest of us.\n \n And finally, you seem to think that just because most of us here see you as an uptight controlling bully, that you can assume that we feel the same way about all christians. Another error on your part.\n \n Wow. Lots of inaccuracies there. Who would have thought?\n \n Smiley",

Just from the information in this thread alone (though you will find similar information throughout the forum), the answers would be.\n \n 1. Of course those of other religions are as bad as atheists. They do not know the eternal light of the one true god and therefore have no moral compass. They are all immoral, godless, blah blah blah.\n \n 2. Morality is whatever Archie thinks morality is. If you have any other opinions then they are immoral. No, a non-christian cannot be moral as they are not in direct contact with the one true eternal god. Though Archie would proabably have written 'can not' rather than 'cannot', but then English can be tricky for him.\n \n 3. As Archie has shown in his posts in this thread, there is no such person as someone who does not believe in Christ but thinks that homosexuality is a bad thing, premarital sex is not good, abortion is a crime etc etc etc. As has been previously stated, non-christians are devoid of any morals, so such people do not exist. Anyone who thinks anything that Archie does not think is an immoral, godless, blah blah blah.\n \n Unfortunately, despite (or possibly in line with) all the evidence in Archie's posts of the truths I have mentioned, he will probably now return and personally attack me for giving this summary of his beliefs (presumably, that is the godly thing to do).\n \n Though I would also be interested in the answers to these questions. He'll probably just come back with 2 pages of biblical quotes that answer nothing, and claim that they explain his position perfectly, but you have to believe to see the meaning, which of course you don't because you are a godless, immoral, blah blah blah.\n \n Smiley",

   "I have some questions for Archangel. I was just wondering what you think of people following other religions? Are they immoral to you as well as atheists?\n \n And then, I guess you will need to clarify what 'morality' means to you. Why can't a non-Christian be a moral person? Is faith in the Christian god what makes the difference?\n \n What about one who does not believe in Jesus but considers homosexuality a bad thing, premarital sex not good, abortion a crime etc etc etc. You know, respects others, never has hurt anyone and so on and so forth.\n \n Perhaps you have already talked about these in this forum but I am new and I'm just trying to have a better understanding on the 'who is who'.\n \n Thanks.\n\n \n Hi Jenny, maybe you should go back to see who originally started this thread and titled it Sweet Beautiful Atheism. They started this discussion by implying that atheism is, and I quote to be godless is to be truly free. A man without a god is a man indeed: he is everything unto himself. And what is more, I agree with his definition of what atheism is. A godless man is to be free of any absolute moral restraints. To determine and live by only what they see as moral and right. I dare say that sometimes their moral compass is right and good, but it is a totally subjective decision so many times they are very wrong in their personal choices of what is right and wrong in this World. He is a NATURAL MAN indeed, and he is a man unto himself with no one to blame but himself when he finally learns the truth about the spiritual aspect of his humanity.",

   "Hello to you too, Archangel.\n \n I think you have added something to undeterred's 'definition' of atheism. He said, as you quoted him, that to be godless is to be truly free (of any absolute moral restraints). What is in the brackets is what you have added to his definition.\n \n I find it strange when you say that atheists' moral code is a matter of a subjective decision. What you want to call 'subjective decision' is in fact 'common logic'.\n \n Anyway, I am still waiting for you to directly answer my questions.\n \n \n \n\"Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?\"\n\n \n Of course they can!",

   "BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\n \n What an incredibly pathetic response. Let's recap:\n \n Archie boy comes on spewing hateful vile and attacking atheists. I nail his XXX for lying about the criminal nature of atheists. He comes back and -- completely avoiding the actual topic -- attacks me for a practice of which I am not guilty.\n \n In everyday life, we call this a lie. In media, we call it libel. It's illegal. Funny for somebody ranting about how Christians are all about morality.\n \n But I digress. I once again bust Archie on his complete, cowardly evasion of the actual topic, and I challenge him to: \n 1. find any instance where I engaged in the practice of which he accused me\n 2. find any source that refutes my claim\n 3. justify his assertion that my only sources are biased\n 4. respond to my questions about God and morality.\n \n What does Archie boy do? He meets none of my challenges, accuses me of having a \"tantrum,\" and runs away. Again.\n \n If it's a debate forum, Archie, then debate already. \"Debate\" does not consist of spouting vile lies and running away with your tail between your legs.\n \n I once again challenge you to defend your points, Archie. Why do you keep running if you have solid footing? Seriously, do you think you're making your position look good? Do you seriously think I'm having a \"tantrum\" or that I'm ecstatic that you're making this so incredibly fun for me? If I'm the mad one, why are you running away while I'm making the challenges?\n \n Oh, silly me. Trying to use logic and reason with Archie...\n\n \n Well, you are talking about the dude that still will not admit that he was using a logical fallacy that I exposed here: http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=272710&highlight=false+choice#post272710 (and also the guy who posted a proven hoax and has thus far refused to admit that he did - almost two years now he's been denying it)\n \n So, I wouldn't expect him to defend his points, etc.\n \n But then I think you and everyone else on these forums knows that. emoticon_xgood emoticon_xgood",

Trying to argue that my character makes my argument wrong isn't going to work when I present evidence detailing just what I said you did. Your argument is nothing more then a modified ad hominem. \n \n \nBut that is your m.o. all the time. To twist and corrupt facts and then claim them as absolute truth.\n\n \n You stated this:\n \n \nDavid B. Kitts. PhD (Zoology) is Head Curator of the Department of Geology at the Stoval Museum. In an evolutionary trade journal, he wrote:\n \n Despite the bright promise that paleontology provides a means of \"seeing\" evolution, it has presented some nasty difficulties for evolutionists, the most notorious of which is the presence of \"gaps\" in the fossil record. Evolution requires intermediate forms between species and paleontology does not provide them... 3\n\n \n What Kitts actually said was this:\n \n \nThe claim has been repeatedly made that the fossil record provides a basis for the falsification of synthetic theory [Neo-Darwinism] and Simpson has demonstrated that this is not the case\n\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/part1-3.html#quote54\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=292259&postcount=38\n \n On top that you posted that Patterson said this:\n \n \nTherefore, based on Darwin's own words, his original theory of macro-evolutionary progression didn't happen. Paleontology was a brand new scientific discipline in the mid-1800's, and now, roughly 150 years later, we know that the fossil record doesn't provide the support Darwin himself required.\n\n \n Unfortunately for you, Patterson cleared up the fraud that the creationists pulled on him and the fraud you're trying to pull now:\n \n \nDear Mr Theunissen,\n \n Sorry to have taken so long to answer your letter of July 9th. I was away for a while, and then infernally busy. I seem fated continually to make a fool of myself with creationists. The specific quote you mention, from a letter to Sunderland dated 10th April 1979, is accurate as far as it goes. The passage quoted continues \"... a watertight argument. The reason is that statements about ancestry and descent are not applicable in the fossil record. Is Archaeopteryx the ancestor of all birds? Perhaps yes, perhaps no: there is no way of answering the question. It is easy enough to make up stories of how one form gave rise to another, and to find reasons why the stages should be favoured by natural selection. But such stories are not part of science, for there is no way to put them to the test.\"\n \n I think the continuation of the passage shows clearly that your interpretation (at the end of your letter) is correct, and the creationists' is false.\n \n That brush with Sunderland (I had never heard of him before) was my first experience of creationists. The famous \"keynote address\" at the American Museum of Natural History in 1981 was nothing of the sort. It was a talk to the \"Systematics Discussion Group\" in the Museum, an (extremely) informal group. I had been asked to talk to them on \"Evolutionism and creationism\"; fired up by a paper by Ernst Mayr published in Science just the week before. I gave a fairly rumbustious talk, arguing that the theory of evolution had done more harm than good to biological systematics (classification). Unknown to me, there was a creationist in the audience with a hidden tape recorder. So much the worse for me. But my talk was addressed to professional systematists, and concerned systematics, nothing else.\n \n I hope that by now I have learned to be more circumspect in dealing with creationists, cryptic or overt. But I still maintain that scepticism is the scientist's duty, however much the stance may expose us to ridicule.\n \n Yours Sincerely,\n \n [signed]\n\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/patterson.html\n \n You completely ignored my refutation on the evolution subforum and now you are claiming you did no such action. The problem is that the subforum with my refutation still exists, and I can quote it showing not only my refutation but your lies. You running away from that subforum does not exonarate you of your colossal fraud.\n \n \nIt is disgusting, yes; but it has offended me since my childhood and is what caused me to originally seek a greater truth than can be found in this World. Thank you for reminding why I love the Lord. emoticon_xangel emoticon_smile emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n My point has been proven.\n \n You state that atheists essentially are not bound by any morals, that they are free to create their own, and you imply that Christians are not.

It means I have made my point and see no reason to continue down at your level of dung diving.\n \n Secondly, It is a fact that any point made by a creationist will most assuredly be refuted by Talkorigins eventually, even if they have to go back to the quoted scientist and allow them to revise history as they did with Patterson. \n \n You see, you are here to prove something. I'm here to give my opinion and defend my beliefs. I learned long ago that people like you are close minded and shallow vessels with no desire to learn about or actually grasp the spiritual side of your being. That is why you use Talk Origins like your bible and use it to refute anything that conflicts with your gospel of evolution. And it is sutherland that is the Engineer, not Patterson. Patterson is a Paleontologist and is the person I quoted. \n \n Also, I have constantly asserted that much of what we find on the Internet is subjective and accepted as truth only half the time but if a source is quoted that is refuted as wrong you, like the disingenuous philosophical coward that you are, you must immediately accuse the poster of PURPOSELY committing a fraud rather than unknowingly posting something that turns out not to be reliable.\n \n The only place in my whole existence that I am constantly called a liar and a fraud is right here by this group of lowlife pseudo intellectuals who think more of themselves than they ought to, with you and a couple of others at the head of the class. That is why I drop debates. Because I don't have to defend myself against lies made by scum bags who don't even know me. So go ahead and slander and defame, I have no recourse here.

Absolutely not!!!\"\n \n These are perfect examples of his inflexibility of beliefs, his narcissistic lack of personal insight, and the terror he harbors that absolutely requires his fixed belief system. \n \n He is pitiable really, if only he weren't so nasty.\n\n \n I want to make a date to meet with you when this life is over for both of us moose, and we will see then who's World view is pitiable. Until then all you offer is cheap lip service based on your limited perspective and ignorance of what is real about the spiritual aspect of humanity.

All I did was quote you and quote the actual person and I'm making up assumptions? \n \n That's.....insane. \n \n I quoted you saying that the author said A, I then cited the Author who actually said B. And I'm making assumptions, I'm delusional and self obsessed? \n \n How is merely quoting what you said and quoting what they said making making assumptions, delusionality and self obsessesion? \n \n \nFirst of all, Just because I get fed up with your misrepresentations and stop posting in any given debate, it doesn't mean I have accepted any defeat in any way. It means I have made my point and see no reason to continue down at your level of dung diving.\n\n \n Show me a single misrepresentation.\n \n \nSecondly, It is a fact that any point made by a creationist will most assuredly be refuted by Talkorigins eventually, even if they have to go back to the quoted scientist and allow them to revise history as they did with Patterson.\n\n \n What are you talking about? The talk which Patterson gave was on classification semantics. That is not in question. Sutherland clearly misrepresented what he said and argued that Patterson's statements on how evolution has made classification semantics more difficult as his view that evolution is entirely wrong. \n \n You are creating your own moral system where the truth is lies and lies are truth. \n \n \nYou see, you are here to prove something. I'm here to give my opinion and defend my beliefs. I learned long ago that people like you are close minded and shallow vessels with no desire to learn about or actually grasp the spiritual side of your being.\n\n \n I have to wonder why you haven't been banned for numerous violations of the TOS. \n \n \nThat is why you use Talk Origins like your bible and use it to refute anything that conflicts with your gospel of evolution. And it is sutherland that is the Engineer, not Patterson. Patterson is a Paleontologist and is the person I quoted. \n\n \n No. You first quoted sutherland as why evolution was wrong passing him off as the Paleontologist . And Patterson cleared up your lies. And you still refuse to admit you misquoted Kitts!\n \n \nAlso, I have constantly asserted that much of what we find on the Internet is subjective and accepted as truth only half the time but if a source is quoted that is refuted as wrong you, like the disingenuous philosophical coward that you are, you must immediately accuse the poster of PURPOSELY committing a fraud rather than unknowingly posting something that turns out not to be reliable.\n\n \n DUDE. You posted a freaky links TV show prop as evidence of creation.\n \n Do you expect me to buy your argument when you are a known fraudster? \n \n \nThe only place in my whole existence that I am constantly called a liar and a fraud is right here by this group of lowlife pseudo intellectuals who think more of themselves than they ought to, with you and a couple of others at the head of the class. That is why I drop debates. Because I don't have to defend myself against lies made by scum bags who don't even know me. So go ahead and slander and defame, I have no recourse here. But don't then have the audacity to claim victory just because I refuse to go down to your level and crawl around in the muck and mire of your debating style.\n\n \n It's amazing you haven't been banned here as all you have are personal insults.\n \n For someone who claims to have been enlightened and having a superior moral system, why is it that only you here use horrible personal insults as your main tool of argumentation? Why is that you are the only one here blatantly violating the TOS? Why is it you who cannot address arguments but instead argue that we are scum and therefore you are right?",

Please do. If you're right all the time, please tell us precisely how the later letter was \"revising history\" when all the letter does was explain the rest of the quote that was purposely cut off, and the rest of the original quote is actually available for you to see.\n \n Will you please please please tell us about how much more ethical and accurate you are, Archie? I mean, you've been nailed left and right for lying and being proud of it, for peddling mined and inaccurate quotes, for completely fabricating stories to support your arguments that get countered, for willful ignorance of facts, and for running away from a fight that you started yourself. And we're supposed to look up to your moral standing?\n \n \nThe only place in my whole existence that I am constantly called a liar and a fraud is right here\n\n I get the impression that you spend your life in your little tiny bubble where there is no variety of opinion and no encouragement to join reality.

Now I know you will attempt to claim that we have no proof those Old Testament books were even written before Jesus lived, but we all know that too is another lie of denial and obfuscation so you can deny the historically documented facts and validity of when those OT books were actually written. \n \n But when it comes to defending the true and real lies of your cult of atheism and evolution you think nothing of ripping alleged facts out of context and creating facts out of thin air.

   "Indeed, and in my experience, most religious people are the same way. But I think what Steeeeve may be saying (and he can correct me if I'm wrong) is that because you believe God doesn't even exist, you can't exactly look to God for any moral guidance. I think he's looking at this from a oneself-versus-God thing, in terms of what people turn to, and \"oneself\" would include doing the things you're talking about. I doubt he was trying to make the case that you can't turn to other people, scientists, etc.\n \n For whatever it's worth, I think it is important to point out that religion and morality are not necessarily the same concept, and not necessarily dependent on one another, depending on the situation. You do realise that reason is also why many religious people know better than to harm others, right? I hope you're not one of these folks that think religion and reason are somehow inversely proportional. See, while I know that God doesn't want me to harm people, I also know it's the correct thing from the standpoint of reason. So religion and reason compliment in this case, rather contradict. The ol' argument atheists sometimes make against religion that it's bad because people only base their morality on \"'cause-god-wants-me-to\" just isn't realistic for most any religious person I've ever known.\n\n \n I take it since neither you or Steeve responded to this -\n \n \nAnother point I'd make, seeing as how you've dismissed Undeterred efforts to get you to see it, is that you have chosen your morality in exactly the same manner I have chosen mine. You made a personal choice to believe in a God and accept the moral code of that deity. I made a similar choice not to believe in God and base my moral code on numerous other sources.\n \n For you to claim the high ground and label all others selfish is absurd.\n\n \n That either your quote here explains the situation -\n \n \nWell since you didn't address my points, I'll assume you're done!

Or does He warn us very clearly that those who compromise are lukewarm and will be spat out at the proper time. Especially this source which is a letter to the last days church of the Laodiceans. I would take it to heart if I were you and decide now if compromising your standards with people who don't even attempt to claim to believe in or accept the Lord is honoring God or in fact attempting to claim a form of righteousness while denying the power there of. Remember this Jyoshu, and I hope you will take it to heart as it is a good barometer of your walk with Christ at all times. \n\n \n Archie, the bottom line is that people see nothing of Jesus' way of doing things in your posts. They see the opposite. The Bible says that, pertaining to Christians, 'by their fruit will you know them', and the only fruit you have here is consistently ticking people off. There are people here (who might normally have little problem pointing out bad behavior as an indictment of Christianity) actually saying that you clearly AREN'T one. Think about it. Have you not noticed that you're getting nowhere here, with anyone, and having the exact opposite effect? Don't you think that's cause for at least SOME self-reflection?",

   "I find I have to point this out all too often, but the better and more accurate comparison is \"fundamentalism to mental illness\" rather than \"religious belief to mental illness.\" It is fundamentalism that tends to be impervious to change--not necessarily the more general concept of religious belief. There are plenty of people with religious belief that are not impervious to change, and there are fundamentalists within the adherents of ideologies other than religions that ALSO tend to be imperious to change. 'Impervious to change', IMO, is a trait of fundamentalism.\n \n I don't mean to nitpick, but I see this mistake made all the time, and IMO it's an unfair generalisation toward religious people in general to not narrow it down to the real problem.\n\n \n I agree.\n I is the resistance to thinking crtitically in any dogmatic belief that is the problem, no matter what the belief is. I admitted that the comparison here is inflammatory, but I was directing my comments toward a specific proponent of dogma. The total package of his behavior, the fixed beliefs, the grandiosity, the narcissism, the black and white thinking, the utter lack of personal insight, all describe a pretty textbook example of a personality disorder.",

And if you piped in at all, it wasn't to defend the scriptural perspective but to find some friendly watered down happy medium that the atheists would embrace but completely diluted the Word of God so you have an appearance of righteousness but denied the power there of. \n \n There is no kinship between us and there never has been so how can I consider you a brother in Christ?

As you judge me of being rigid, uncompromising and combative so would you have accused the Lord of being the same way rather than understand His righteous Indignation at what was happening in His Fathers House, the Temple. Plain and simple jyoshu, everytime you have gone against me in any debate or fundies in any debate in favor of your spiritually dead friends, you have both betrayed the Gospel you claim to believe and the unbelievers whom you have just encouraged into settling into their false beliefs that will eventually condemn them. So you aren't helping anyone at all by being luke warm.

You basically equate non-literalism with unbelief on most everything, and that's just not a valid way of doing things.\n\n \n Read this verse again and understand what it is saying jyoshu.\n Pro 25:26 If the godly compromise with the wicked, it is like polluting a fountain or muddying a spring.\n It couldn't be more clear my friend. When ever you compromise Gods truth with unbelievers you water down and pollute the truth. From there you have corrupted it and after that it has lost its power. It is likened to salt that has lost its savor. That is what you have contributed here by your compromising to get along with people who don't need you, they need Jesus and salvation.\n \n Note the bolded above as an example. You claim to trust God with your life, right? You believe He is all knowing and omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent, right? And yet you have the audacity to tell me God is incapable of expressing Himself accurately in the Creation account in genesis? I'm sorry jyoshu, but I am struggling with your level of faith in Him.\n \n Cry out to God in Jesus name and say to Him, \"Father I believe, please help me in my unbelief\" because you need to realize that if God be God in Truth, and you believe that He is the author of both life and the bible as He say's He is, then His Word is reliable and trustworthy. \n \n I don't claim to understand every aspect of what God tells us in the bible jyoshu, but then again, I'm not expected to as He understands my limitations. What is expected of me though is that I trust and believe Him in all aspects of His Word and in my life. That is what true faith is. Remember what He said to the Apostle Thomas? Blessed are you thomas who saw me and believed, but much more blessed are those who don't see me yet believe. There is an extra Crown of Glory for we who believe God by faith based only on the indwelling of the Holy Spirit within us. \n \n So just remember that every time you defend the secular humanists against me and imply there is something wrong with my version of Christianity, you strengthen their resolve as atheists, evolutionists and secular humanists, you plunge them deeper into the pit of satans lies and deceptions and ultimately his eternal grasp. And with that outcome, you actually end up being that which you hate and fear the most, an accomplice of the devil and the enemy of the God you claim to love. The bible makes clear we are in a spiritual battle jyoshu, you will be held responsible for the side you fight on one day.\n \n And this is what I will leave you with jyoshu. Search out your heart and ask yourself if you have received Gods Holy Spirit which He promised would guide us in all understanding. Below is the key to being born again; truly saved so that you know it, not just hope for it. Read them well and commit them to your heart, mind and soul because they represent eternal life for all who believe them.\n \n Act 2:38 Peter {said} to them, \"Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\n \n Act 1:8 but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.\"\n \n Act 5:32 \"And we are witnesses of these things; and {so is} the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.\"\n Obey Him means trusting Him. Not just saying we are christians but defending our Christianity by believing what God say's over what man say's. \n \n Be at peace and please don't take offense at anything I have said because I am speaking in love here. Not to hurt you but to enlighten you to the truth.",

It's not Christ-like to stubbornly argue and quarrel with people, which is what you do. \n \n I've already told you, it's not your beliefs on the central tenets of the faith that are the problem; it's your literalism and approach. This isn't about compromise or defending the faith. It's about your arrogance and has no room for anything but literalism. You do more harm to the cause of Christ than good, because you don't show the love of Christ. It's that simple. \n \n But there's obviously no reasoning with you, so I'm not going to debate you, Archie. You aren't even addressing the real problem, so it doesn't look like there's much hope in you seeing the real issue here.",

   "What specifically did he say to lead you to those conclusions? I don't know what speech you heard, but I have heard Romney's religion speech as well as read it, and I see nothing there that declares war on secularism, OR intimated that it's ONLY believers who offer anything of worth, OR that separation of church and state is bad. (In fact he defended separation of church and state.)\n \n The text of the speech is here (among plenty of other places accessible via Google search) for people to draw their own conclusions.\n\n \n Well, I just pulled out some quotes from Romney's published speech here... they are in order of presentation:\n \n \nIn John Adams' words: ``We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion. ... Our Constitution,'' he said, ``was made for a moral and religious people.''\n \n Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom. Freedom opens the windows of the soul so that man can discover his most profound beliefs and commune with God. Freedom and religion endure together, or perish alone.\n \n ......\n \n Whether it was the cause of abolition, or civil rights, or the right to life itself, no movement of conscience can succeed in America that cannot speak to the convictions of religious people.\n \n ......\n \n But in recent years, the notion of the separation of church and state has been taken by some well beyond its original meaning. They seek to remove from the public domain any acknowledgment of God. Religion is seen as merely a private affair with no place in public life. It's as if they are intent on establishing a new religion in America - the religion of secularism. They are wrong.\n \n ......\n \n We are a nation ``under God'' and in God, we do indeed trust.\n \n We should acknowledge the Creator as did the Founders in ceremony and word. He should remain on our currency, in our pledge, in the teaching of our history, and during the holiday season, nativity scenes and menorahs should be welcome in our public places. Our greatness would not long endure without judges who respect the foundation of faith upon which our constitution rests. I will take care to separate the affairs of government from any religion, but I will not separate us from 'the God who gave us liberty.'\n \n Nor would I separate us from our religious heritage. Perhaps the most important question to ask a person of faith who seeks a political office, is this: Does he share these American values - the equality of human kind, the obligation to serve one another and a steadfast commitment to liberty?\n \n They are not unique to any one denomination. They belong to the great moral inheritance we hold in common. They're the firm ground on which Americans of different faiths meet and stand as a nation, united. \n \n ......\n \n Americans acknowledge that liberty is a gift of God, not an indulgence of government.\n\n \n Well... there's not much there for secularists except criticism of secularism in government, and nothing at all for non-believers. Apparently, we can't contribute to Romney's America, which is probably just as well, as none of us would want to contribute to any America of Romney's vision, because it has no place for us, only for people of the faiths he finds acceptable. Or rather, politically expedient to butter up.\n \n I suppose we could wait for Romney to make a speech accepting non-believers as contributing citizens of value, but i won't hold my breath. The man is an utter charlatan, saying only the things he wants you to hear. And you only hear the things he wants you to hear.",

And I made the point I wanted to make which was this, if I posted too many verses for you to get the point. \n \n 1Cr 2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God,\n 1Cr 2:13 which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual {thoughts} with spiritual {words.}\n 1Cr 2:14 But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised.\n This passage explains perfectly why you and unker and others who criticize and condemn Gods word can read the words in the bible but miss entirely the spiritual truths within it.",
