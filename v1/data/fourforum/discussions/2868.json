   "if anybody has ever picked up the bible or even a childrens book of bible stories, theyd see no shortage of depictions of miraculous events performed either by God of by his power through his prophets and disciples. Jesus himself performed miracles, and bestowed this miracle working power upon his disciples as his ministry ended. in particular, he blessed them with the power to do greater works than he did (John 14:12)\n \n interestingly enough, if you go chronologically through the timeline of the bible, youd notice that the miracles are progressively less grand. the first and greatest miracle was the 6-day miracle marathon of creating order on planet earth and intruducing life and mankind on it. next was the unsurpassed miracle of the global flood (including building the ark and rounding up pairs of each living animal). not long after we find the description of the destruction of sodom and gomorah, the plagues of egypt, the crossing of the red sea, the collapse of jericho's walls, joshua's 48 hour day and david's defeat of goliath (with minor miracles in between). the notable thing is that preceding miracles never seem to be as grand as any before them, as if God's power was continually toning down\n \n when Jesus steps on the scene, miracles resurge. although not in any grand scale like the old testament, they were more localized. however, jesus is consistently impressive with his feats throughout his life time, raising the dead, casting out demons, healing the blind and paralyzed, multiplying food, walking on water and finally resurrecting himself. his disciples continue to do miracles, but to a much less extent. peter revives a youth that falls out of the window on the day of pentecost. ananias and saphira fall dead in peter's church. paul is struck blind and then has his sight restored. paul and silas escape prison by way of an earthquake.\n \n after this, we see more descriptions of \"fuzzy\" miracles, such as casting out demons and healing abstract ailments. these miracles have no physical manifestation\n \n in today's world, we have no miracles at all except these 'fuzzy' miracles, which nobody can witness except the subject. and more than half of these modern \"miracle workers\" have been exposed as frauds\n \n \n \n ok, my question: did miracles ever really happen? and did jesus ever do miracles? and did he really bestow miraculous power on his disciples and \"he who believes\" on him?\n \n this question is really aimed to christians and theists, but athiests can share their opinions, if they think it will help answer the question",

   "ok, my question: did miracles ever really happen? and did jesus ever do miracles? and did he really bestow miraculous power on his disciples and \"he who believes\" on him?\n\n \n The answer to all of your questions is yes. Miracles have occurred in the past and they continue to occcur everyday all around us. There are to many examples to explore with some depth. However, I would like to bring to your attention the process that is required for an individual to attain sainthood from the Roman Catholic Church. It is a long and detailed process which frequently takes over 100 years complete. The centerpiece of proving that an individual should attain sainthood lies in proving that said individual performed or was credited with 3 miracles. This investigation is just as rooted in science as it is in theology. The Church takes these matters very seriously.\n \n Ponder this point, if God felt it necessary to demonstrate his existence by frequently and publicly working vast miracles there would be no true believers. There would only be people who believed what they saw and knew God is real. It takes FAITH to believe in that which we cannot see and only those who hold their beliefs close to their hearts are able withstand the trials of our increasingly secularly minded society. \n \n We may never know to what extent Jesus worked miracles here on Earth but we must believe that the true miracles lie not in healing the sick or walking on water but in the everyday blessings that we enjoy as Children of God.",

   "here ya go!\n \n It is a well-known fact that religious modernists read the Bible through the rose-colored lenses of their own naturalistic presuppositions. Take, for example, the Old Testament narrative regarding Israel's passage through the Red Sea. \n \n \"And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left\" (Exodus 14:21-22). \n That this was a miraculous event admits of no doubt to those who take the biblical text seriously. Moses later wrote:\n \n \n \"The floods stood upright as a heap; the deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea\" (Ex. 15:8). \n The psalmist declared:\n \n \n \"He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as a heap\" (Psa. 78:13). \n And all of this happened just when Moses held out his hand over the water. \n \n Liberal theologians attempt to explain the passage through the Red Sea in several naturalistic ways. For example, The Interpreter's Bible notes:\n \n \n \"To childish minds miracles seem necessary lest man should ascribe his escape to his own ingenuity.\" \n Another writer in the same volume says: \n \n \n \"In flat marshy districts large areas are often intermittently covered by shallow water or laid dry by the action of the wind. . . \" (Buttrick, pp. 937-8). \n It is commonly suggested that the designation \"Red Sea\" (yam sup) should be rendered \"Sea of Reeds.\" Supposedly then, the place at which Israel left Egypt was but a \"marshy\" area that was dried out by a temporary wind. This view is argued upon the supposition that the Hebrew term sup is related to an Egyptian word meaning \"reed.\" It is also possible, however, that sup may relate to the Hebrew term sop, which signifies \"end\" or \"conclusion\" (of the earth), and thus could refer simply to several connected bodies of water extending southward from Palestine and Arabia (Myers, p. 876).\n \n In 1 Kings 9:26 sup refers to the Gulf of Aqabah, where Solomon's navy was kept. Professor Kenneth Kitchen believes that yam sup extended from the Egyptian delta north of Suez, along the line of the present Suez Canal to the Gulf of Suez and Aqabah - and even beyond that area (Douglas, pp. 1077-8). Wherever the exodus took place, it was at a point where the sea was deep enough to drown the entire Egyptian army. \n \n A few years back some writers argued that a volcanic erruption on the island of Santorini (about 500 miles north of Egypt), c. 1450 B.C., could have produced a tidal wave that parted the Red Sea. There is no evidence for this view. Others have suggested that a volcanic explosion in the 13th century B.C. parted the Red Sea. Such would hardly have accommodated the Israelites, since the exodus under Moses occurred in the mid-15th century B.C.!\n \n Conservative Bible scholars have long viewed this incident as a clear example of a supernatural event on behalf of the Hebrew people. One writer notes:\n \n \n \"[W]ind alone did not do all that was necessary in this instance. God alone had to intervene with additional supernatural power. We know that the water involved was deep, and not merely that of a marshy area, for later the Egyptians were drowned in it (Exod. 14:27-28). More-over, the lake bottom was made sufficiently dry (Exod. 14:22, the Hebrew using yahbashah) so that Israelites could drive their wagons over it. Still further, the path had to be very wide, perhaps as much as a mile, to permit more than two million Israelites to cross during part of one night. To push back water for a half mile on one side and a half mile on the other side would indeed take the miraculous power of Almighty God\" (Wood, p. 106). \n Professor John Davis has forcefully shown that a \"natural wind\" could never satisfy the language demands of the Exodus context. He cites four reasons why this situation must be viewed as miraculous. \n \n \n It is doubtful that a purely natural wind could produce a \"wall\" of water (v. 22). \n \n If a strictly natural wind blew from the east, the water most likely would have been walled up in a north/south direction, which would have prevented the Israelites' crossing. \n \n Two walls of water rose up, which suggests that the waters were divided by a special wind (v. 16). \n \n If a natural wind came from the east, and continued its force, sustaining the north and south walls of water (which later returned and drowned the Egyptian army), how could the Israelites possibly have crossed the area in the face of such a fierce velocity? (pp. 165-6). \n Moreover, H.A. Han has noted that a strong wind currently blows from north to south in the northern vicinity of the Gulf of Suez (where the Israelites are commonly believed to have crossed the sea) about nine months out of the year. Thus an \"east wind\" parting the sea would be quite unusual, \"truly an act of God\" (see Pfeiffer, et al., p. 1447).\n \n It is rather tragic that some, who profess respect for the Bible, have been so profoundly influenced by liberalism that they attempt to explain this supernatural event in a naturalistic fashion. One of our own has written:\n \n \n \"When you discuss the credibility of the Bible, you have to be careful not to try to explain something that is presented in the Bible as a miracle. A miracle is, by definition, something that you cannot explain naturally. Many times, however, the Bible presents an event as a natural act of God. The parting of the Red Sea is one such event\" (Clayton, emp. added). \n \n http://www.christiancourier.com/archives/redSeaMiracle.htm\n \n The point really supports the \"exageration of miracles in the bible to make them seem bigger than they really were.",

   "I just wish someone would answer your consistent and persistent question: Where is the problem in the statement attributed to Jesus about the continued manifestation of miracles to those who believe in him? Why are religionists not addressing this?\n\n What could I do to make you believe that miracles (events that cannot be explained by natural means) have occurred to others and me? It would be silly for me to post them. Not a thing against you, but I think you would sneer and shrug it off. Why is it required to be the physical world that experiences the miracle? Could a miracle happen to a person&#8217;s spirit that changed his life, his way of thinking, his attributes? Of course it could, but it cannot be presented here or anyplace else as tangible.\n If a person lying on their couch, contemplating suicide, drops down on his knees and prays that this &#8220;burden&#8221; be taken away, this feeling of despair and hopelessness, and God suddenly frees him of that evil &#8211; right then &#8211; would it not be considered a miracle?\n As I have stated before, the televangelists &#8220;conjure up&#8221; miracles the same way that witches summon the evil spirits. But this is not what we are told in the Bible. The Apostle Paul states more than once about adhering to doctrine and faith in Christ with no mention of signs and wonders. Why? Because the commandment of Christ was to utilize that which is within us &#8211; His Spirit.\n Faith requires no signs or wonders, and without faith it is impossible to please God. Please God? Why? He has told us that He sets before us life and death and pleads with us to choose life. When we do that pleases Him.\n \n Anyway, back to my point: There could be signs and wonders daily, but it would not bring about faith. As soon as the miracles ceased, so would faith and that person, or population for that matter, would soon return to fear and doubt, wondering if there really were miracles and then wondering if there was a God. Out of approximately 340 or more miracles recorded in the scriptures the reaction of the people was not positive. They hated the prophets and God for the majority of them.\n \n I want to draw your attention also to unkerpaulie&#8217;s post:\n \n Jesus himself said, in John 14: 12-14 - \"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I go to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son; if you ask anything in my name, I will do it. \"\n\n I maintain that we misunderstand this scripture. No one ever has nor ever will do greater works than Christ. The greater He was referring to here, I believe, was the works of the Holy Spirit through us, not only against the Powers of Darkness, but in spreading the Gospel. That is paramount &#8211; the Gospel. The Gospel does not require signs and wonders.\n \n For many of us that see the miracles of God, they cannot be explained nor displayed to the public.",

   "ok, first of all, even if the \"greater works\" described by jesus refered to the working of the holy spirit through us, then wouldnt those works resmemble the works that jesus did (ie, miracles)?\n\n Jesus executed the Power of God through the natural to the natural before He was crucified. During that time His Spirit was not in man. Sure, He did these things so that the manifestation could be physically seen, but afterwards it was to be seen, and used, for/against the &#8220;unseen&#8221; things of this life.\n It is more important to know God than to know about him. Many scriptures can be taken out of context when trying to find out about God &#8211; just look at how many members here think that God is a mean, uncaring God through their interpretation of the Bible.\n I am not shying away from your question, unkerpaulie, it&#8217;s just that there are so many things that are negative about miracles these days, that even when one occurs it can be beaten do death with natural, but improper explanations and take with it that person through whom it came&#8230;and, then bring about another reason to question God.\n For example: &#8220;The Bible says that God is no respecter of persons. If that&#8217;s so, then why did He part the Red Sea to allow the Hebrews to cross to safety, but drown the Egyptians? Sounds like it was a &#8220;miracle for murder&#8221;, to me.&#8221;\n \n \nsecond, if miracles are not required for spreading the gospel, then why are they in the gospels? the miracle of jesus' self-resurrection is pivotal to spreading the gospel. if it never happened, then how valid is the gospel?\n\n What is required for the Gospel? Belief and faith. Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God. Would it be more of a miracle to get an atheist to believe than to move a mountain? So which one would be more beneficial: the saving of a soul or the movement of a mountain? And, I say that when you do bring someone to God, you have done more than move a mountain.\n If it never happened then we all are going to die and that&#8217;s it. No eternal life and no spiritual death. The report has been told of His resurrection in the Bible, so if that&#8217;s unbelievable then nothing I can say will surpass it.\n What if the words of the Bible all of a sudden became alive and began moving you towards a better understanding of God, then towards His reason for you living? Would that be a miracle? That is the only miracle required of the Gospel: To seek and save. What is more important than that?\n Again, faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God &#8211; not by reading the words of the Bible.\n \nthird, compare the miracles that cannot be witness or explained by the public to those that jesus did. take for instance, the blind man that jesus healed in front of the temple. he told the man not to tell anyone, but he still did, and the preists were astonished. things like that are very clearly \"witnessable\".\n\n Again, this is before His resurrection. A better miracle is to open the eyes of those that cannot see the things of God.\n Miracles do happen today. And to be frank, I think people see better special FX on TV, so they just overlook them.\n \n Miracles in the physical realm only last a little while, but the effect one has on your spirit-man will last a lifetime.",

   "\"A law or body of laws that derives from nature and is believed to be binding upon human actions apart from or in conjunction with laws established by human authority.\"\nPrecisely; now, from this, just how do you get a \"break in a law\". I warned you twice to reconsider your premises with what a \"natural law\" is, but you haven't. Nevertheless, I'll explain. \n \n We simply call something a \"law\" or a \"theory\" based on what we see throughout nature. Once we have repeatedly observed something, we can then propose empirical facts (note: this is far different to what a \"fact\", alone, is). That is to say, a \"law\" doesn't do anything in itself. For example, it would be erroneous to suggest that \"when two bodies collide, momentum is conserved because of the law of conservation of momentum\". That is not how they work. We observe the collision between two bodies, say bodies A and B, and we find that momentum is conserved. We do this, say, a plethora of times and then formulate a theory to describe this. That is all that a \"law\" (in science), is. When God intervines, he doesn't \"break the laws of nature\" -- what would that even mean? \n \n Well anyway, just in case this isn't fully explained enough for you, I'll leave you with C.S. Lewis' more than adequate explanation of it:\n * This perhaps helps to make a little clearer what the laws of Nature really are. We are in the habit of talking as if they caused events to happen; but they have never caused any event at all. The laws of motion do not set billiard balls moving: they analy[z]e the motion after something else (say, a man with a cue, or a lurch of the liner, or, perhaps, supernatural power) has provided it. They produce no events: they state the pattern to which every event - if only it can be induced to happen - must conform, just as the rules of arithmetic state the pattern to which all transactions with money must conform - if only you can get hold of any money. Thus in one sense the laws of Nature cover the whole field of space and time; in another, what they leave out is precisely the whole real universe - the incessant torrent of actual events which makes up true history. That must come from somewhere else. To think the laws can produce it is like thinking that you can create real money by simply doing sums. For every law, in the last resort, says \"if you have A, then you will get B.\" But first catch you're a: the laws won't do it for you.\n \n It is therefore inaccurate to define a miracle as something that breaks the laws of Nature. It doesn't. if I knock out my pipe I alter the position of a great many atoms: in the long run, and to an infinitesimal degree, of all the atoms there are. Nature digests or assimilates this event with perfect ease and harmoni[z]es it in a twinkling with all other events. It is more bit of raw material for the laws to apply to, and they apply. I have simply thrown one event into the general cataract of events and it finds itself at home there and conforms to all events. If God annihilates or creates of deflects a unit of matter He has created a new situation at that point. Immediately all Nature domiciles this new situation, makes it at home in her realm, adapts all other events to it. It finds itself conforming to all the laws. If God creates a miraculous spermatozoon in the body of a virgin, it does not proceed to break [violate] any laws. The laws at once take it over. Nature is ready. Pregnancy follows, according to all normal laws, and nine months later a child is born.... Miraculous wine will intoxicate.... The divine art of miracle is not an art of suspending the pattern to which events conform but of feeding new events into that pattern. It does not violate the law's provisio, \"If A, then B\": it says, \"But this time instead of A, A2,\" and Nature, speaking through all her laws, replies, \"Then B2\" and naturali[z]es the immigrant, as she well knows how. She is an accomplished hostess.\n \n A miracle is emphatically not an event without cause or without results. Its cause is the activity of God: its result follows according to Natural law. In a forward direction (i.e., during the time which follows its occurrence) it is interlocked with all Nature just like any other event. Its peculiarity is that it is not in that way interlocked backwards, interlocked with the previous history of Nature. And this is just what some people find intolerable. The reason they find it intolerable is that they start by taking Nature to be the whole of reality. (C. S. Lewis was quoted from his book Miracles, chpt. 8, \"Miracles and the Laws of Nature\")\nNevertheless, I'd say the Dictionary definition you provided was rather interesting; needless to say, it is far different to yours. Anyhow, seeing how fruitless it is for us to simply be bickering over minor points, I'd like to call [at least a temporary] truce -- I assure you it will prove to be far more prosperous if we work to the conclusions together instead of battling against each other.",

   "i understand this, and yes, people that put their total trust in God wouldnt have this problem. to them this issue doesnt exist. but its still undeniable that if you look at that passage in context of jesus' life and what he refered to as his \"works\", then something is very wrong, either with jesus, john or mordern day believers.\n\n His works were done so that a lost and dying world would immediately stop what they were doing, look at the miracle and wonder where it came from. It jogged some memories of the ones that somewhat believed the true scriptures instead of the modified sermons. His goal was to fulfill the law, the scriptures and then save mankind while He was in the flesh &#8211; take back that which Satan had stripped from us. He knew, that without His Spirit in mankind, there would be no other way to get their attention. The miracles, signs, and wonders had to be manifested in the physical world until His resurrection. After that, He promised to give His Spirit to any that asked. That&#8217;s when miracles as they were &#8220;in the day&#8221; were not required as frequently or as pronounced. (Even though some miracles today are still extraordinary, IMO.\n \nyes, but how effective would the bible be if it just contained jesus' teaching and philosophy, and none of his works. how could he claim to be the son of God if he never did anything God-like? the greatest tool that believers use on non-believers in any conversion is the belief that the supernatural is real. to accept jesus and claim the holy spirit, you must believe that with God all things are possible, and that God will do anything you ask of him, just like jesus said.\n\n It&#8217;s not how effective would the Bible be, but would His presence be that noticeable. The Scriptures say that people flocked from all over to see this Man. Once He had their attention, then His teachings and values, attributes, etc. would be more readily accepted. If He were not God these miracles, signs and wonders could not have taken place. They (the people) knew that.\n The tool(s) used by believers on non-believers is the belief that there is a God: True. But, what your next sentence omits is that once they believe they are lead by that belief to another plane, another realm where their spirit can meet the Holy Spirit. Miracles are not required then. However, if they doubt, not even a miracle can substitute for that unbelief. The greatest miracle is accepting His Spirit. All else fades from view &#8211; nothing can compare.\n \nit could be too easily \"explained away\" as me changing my perspective. people change all the time, for better or worse, and dont necessarily ascribe credit to God for it. an atheist becoming a christian is certainly a leap of philosphy and mentality, but you cannot say it is any more \"miraculous\" than a vegan that started eating at kfc\n\n When that day comes that the Word of God comes alive, neither you nor anyone else can explain that away. You can&#8217;t because it would be as evident as the sunrise, others because they can&#8217;t even grasp the thought. I am sure that some would try, but those are the ones that would deny any miracle &#8211; see my point?\n And, yes, changing in general is a given. But, changing in the spirit is not &#8211; you either accept Him or you don&#8217;t. That&#8217;s the rub. If Waxy or sinjin or billsco suddenly stopped all that they were doing, fell on their knees and worshiped God due to a miracle in their spirit-man, that, to them, would be a miracle. (I use them because they are known here&#8230;and they are my friends). If either one of them were to see a mountain in Japan suddenly separate from the ground and relocate to Africa, then they would try to gain as much knowledge about that event as possible &#8211; how it happened, what event of the universe or of the earth itself caused such a thing. It could take quite awhile for them to either understand the scientific explanation of such a phenomenon or just call it a freak of nature. Which would be more beneficial? In the days of the prophets and when Christ walked as man, there was no event other than the physical that could bring such awe.\n \ngranted, but how you accept that the work within your life is a miracle unless you first accept that God is a miracle-working God, and that miracles are possible, particularly the ones described in the bible?\n\n I suppose you mean &#8220;how can I&#8217;? Which means anyone, right? I think that&#8217;s what you meant.\n A life-changing experience can only happen when an event occurs to cause it, right? Simple enough. Some people want God to come into their life, but are reluctant. That&#8217;s when God reaches out and takes them by the hand. These are the ones that know what it feels like to have God as the miracle. It is not necessary, IMO, to have a miracle happen in your life, for yourself, after you receive God. But they still can and do happen to me and to my friends and to true Christians all over the world. That&#8217;s the best part of it; God is not standing in the shade waiting for us He is coming to us, always. A miracle can happen (and does I believe) to those who do not believe, but they don&#8217;t place themselves in position to receive it.",

   "first, if there were works even comparable to what jesus did occuring today, then it would make sense to debate if they were greater or not. jesus healed the paralyzed, raised the dead, caused food to multiply, commanded the weather and restored sight to the blind. unless somewhere in the world works are being done comparable to these that you or i havent heard of, i assume that they are not happening today at all\nOdd that you should write this and then request that we put the \"greater works\" aside, but -- I agree. \nsecond, jesus said in that verse \"he who believes in me\", which implies anyone that believes in him.\nThat's not strictly correct, particularly since he's addressing a group of people specifically. A scenario. Let's say that I'm training some Police officers, and I say that \"he who gets assaulted, can then arrest them\", this doesn't apply to everyone, this only applies to the people in training there -- the police officers.

I don't doubt that you might be correct, but it deosn't necessitate that conclusion. \nlets assume that there are 1000 believers in the world at any time, and that each believer can perform 20 miracles in any 3.5 year period in their life (approximately jesus' ministry), that means in one year there should be an average of 1000 miracles per year (assuming a 70 year life span). thats about 3 miracles every day, dead being raised, blind people seeing, etc\nDidn't check your figures, I'm sure they're sound. ;) 20 miracles in 3.5 years sounds like a stretch, but that doesn't really matter.

Sinjin and I were talking about this last night... I try to imagine that people back then are not much different than we are today... except really ignorant.. but maybe the miracles were not so grand... a little embellishment goes a long way..kinda like playing telephone..\n I realize that Jesus made the blind man see, but do we really know how blind he was...

Terribly hilarious, sorry. What are we debating about here? I believe it's even in the title -- you couldn't miss it. It's Miracles. Now, instead of us arguing for hours, why not get some ground premises that we already agree on (we agree on the validity of logic, that doesn't need to be said, sorry), next things next: definitions. \n \n If we're gonna argue whether something, x, occurs, I should surely want to know what this x is and what it involves. I doubt you normally clarify definitions in your debates (as your comment suggests), but if you see any proper or formal debates, that's the first thing that's done -- and yes, there is logic behind clarifying \"pointless semantics\". It saves a whole lot of extra hassle, and gets down to the beef of the argument. You probably don't think it has saved time, but I can assure you, it's avoided an awful lot of semantic claptrap, and it has certainly shortened a whole pointless debate of saying, \"x occurs\", \"does not!\", \"does too!\".\n \n Sorry for my tone, but in reply to your comment(s), I doubt you'd understand anything else, or respond to anything else.

   "I believe my answer can be summed up by WHAT? But I'll carry on. I'm sorry, but if you knew anything about debate you would know who's argument has been reduced to semantics and who is [at least attempting to] use logic. Please don't even attempt to suggest that I don't know about logic, you would be completely erroneous. If this isn't proof that you haven't even been reading this thread then I don't know what is. I must say, I surely love the way you try to switch the onus of evidence. Unkerpaulie has repeatedly (almost every post) proposed the premise that miracles are not occurring today. I ask for evidence, and say that \"how do you know, they could be happening all the time\", but somehow you get the twisted idea, from this, that I'm implying that they're happening all the time and that we don't know about them.

Further to that, IMHO, a discussion, or a debate if you will, has two sides. You seem to approach it as though it's an interrogation. Perhaps in your world of superior intelligence that's how people communicate, I guess I'll never know.\n \n I take it that I got your main contention wrong. I spent a lot of time trying to come up with what I thought your contention was. You've never even been close to stating it, so I had to infer, based on what seemed to be your biggest disagreement with unkerpaulie. (besides the definition of a miracle).\n \n Anyhoo, here's my perspective of this exchange, a Cole's notes if you will, as I've been following it -\n \n UP- Are miracles real?\n \n DW - What's a miracle?\n \n UP - An act of God?\n \n DW - Not good enough, what's a miracle? Please expand. Also, how can one miracle be more grand than another.\n \n UP - An act that defies the laws or nature or physics, generally considered to be done by God or of the supernatural? Well, it would seem to me that parting the Red Sea is more spectacular than escaping from prison.\n \n DW - Not good enough, what is a natural law? And, now your being inconsistent. Miracles are subjective\n \n UP - What do you want from me? That's my definition of a miracle. Do you have a better one? Yes, the \"greatness\" of miracles is subjective.\n \n DW - Are you taking the Bible literally or figuratively? Why are you attacking Christians? Is a spoon falling to the ground a miracle?\n \n UP - What? I never said anything about attacking Christians. I don't know what else I can tell you about miracles. Let's leave the details for a moment can we? Here's my case - lots of miracles, Jesus said people will do miracles, I don't see any miracles happening today. Why not?\n \n DW - Yeah, but what's a miracle really? Was Jesus actually talking to everyone, or just those there? Literal or figurative? By the way, your definition of a miracle is still not to my liking. Of course, you changing it in any way will make you inconsistent and wrong. How do you know there are no miracles happening today?\n \n UP - Well, I don't see any, we have a global media, and I haven't seen any reported, so I'm inferring that no grand miracles are happening. I suppose it can be taken literally or figuratively, here's the consequences of both as I see it.\n \n DW - Well maybe people aren't asking for miracles today, did you ever think of that? Just because you can, doesn't mean you will.\n \n and so on, and so on.............. AD NAUSEUM. I think you get the point.\n \n At what point do you agree on a definition of miracle? How many times can you go around and around on an issue? If you have some definite thoughts on miracles, why not present them? There comes a point IMHO, when an agreeable definition should just be adopted, you seem completely unwilling to work toward that. In short, IMHO, you come across as being only antagonistic, evasive and rather childish, when you could have been helpful or proactive in proposing a solution.\n \n What you've done is take what could be an interesting discussion IMHO, and turn it into a little private backhanded lecture for everyone here on logic and debate. You're not a contestant in the national debate championships here. People are simply trying to express ideas and have a conversation. Everyone knows you have a superior intellect and grasp of logic, but all your nitpicking isn't going to get you any points or a new car.\n \n I realize the importance of details, but you can get lost in them too.\n \n So, like I said, if you have some thoughts or something to add, go for it. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the forest, your examination of every tree is getting tiresome.\n \n Anyhoo, I'm done with this, I'm not sure why I got involved in the first place. I was interested in the topic and got frustrated by the lack of progress. For the record, I don't necessarily agree with Unkerpaulie, and I do get the point of defining a miracle, but sheeeeshhhh, there comes a time to move on.\n \n This is my time.\n \n Waxy",

   "Off topic but this reminds me of a situation I have with my father. For many years my father has been regularly seeing apparitions(ghosts?) in his home. My stepmother now dead was terminally ill when they started and despite my expectation that they would end with her passing they persist. He is not the only one to claim to have seen \"something\" but others who have been in the house extensively have seen nothing. These apparitions react to my father's words but not always in a pleasant way. \n \n Here's the thing. Being an atheist/existentialist I have had concern for my father and his mental health but he is otherwise very sound of mind and body and of course I can trust him. Should I therefore believe in ghosts?\n\n \n IMO, there could be \"entities\" that have not moved on from their earth home, by their choice probaly. Not all people have the mental \" receiver\" to pick up on them and those people do NOT believe in such a thing as a paranormal world. I know some people that have had experiences with entities (they were with someone too , when the paranormal occurence was happening) . A lot of hoaxes/stories have been told and written about entities (ghosts) , some of them foolish, some just defy logic and are hard to discount or give credit to... On a different note, my mother-in law is now in her 3 rd year of rapidily advancing Alzeimers . She started out in her first year with the disease , seeing children floating in her bedroom and she would talk to them, and she would reply out loud, as if she was getting a response from the apparitions. A prescription pill from her doctor stopped those conversations, along with dulling what little of her senses she still had intact . What a dreadful disease,",

Then, they could all be taught the WORD, that for which HE was sent here for , for us to hear and make our own choice about. \n\n I agree that jesus' miracles were aimed at impressing his presence upon the people around him to get their attention. but it also was aimed at putting a hope in them. the miracles he performed weren't fireworks and neon banners, they were healing, raising the dead, basically championing the depressed and fallen. yes, it would draw crowds that would be attentive to his doctrine, but the works themselves were more than just speech ice-breakers\n \n \nIF, IF, a person stood on Time Square today and performed one of the miracles liken to those of the OLD days, most likely that person would get to be on CNN, get on the front page of the Enquirer for a time, and then just be forgotten about, OR put in a institution because they would be a distraction to the political campaigns.... The miracles performed by Jesus served a purpose, they got the attention of the followers, enough so they would open up their hardened hearts and carnal minds, to allow the Christ Spirit in them, and guys, as they say around here, the rest is just history, and a history that is still alive today. Miracles do happen today, some are the result of strong and ferverent prayer, some happen just because that person might be one of God's buds, :)\n\n if a person from the mountains of tibet, or the heart of the congo, or greenland, was just rumoured to be performing a miracle similar to what jesus did in the gospel, particularly witnessable miracles, news networks would be there in hours, and among christain circles that person would be instantly immortalized. in times square such a person could nearly bring new york city to a halt.\n \n the \"miracles\" that happen today are too often personal triumphs or what can be considered coincidences. if a guy survives a motor accident, we call that a miracle. if a woman finds meets her identical twin at a garage sale that she never met in her life before, thats a miracle. if a baby born with deformed legs grows up to be an olympic long-jumper, we say thats a miracle. \n \n in jesus' days, it was no coincidence that the scales fell off the blind man's eyes after jesus spoke to him, nor the woman with the internal bleeding healed as soon as she touched his gown, nor the storm at sea suddenly cease when jesus commanded it to. compared to the abstract and ambiguous \"miracles\" today, there is a huge difference\n \n why would we say that miracles are not as necesary today as they were in jesus' day, if they ever happened at all?",

A believer should not need a \"sign\" or a miracle to believe. \"Do not tempt the Lord your God\".\n\n of course those who have not seen and yet believe are more blessed than those who only believe when they see (jesus to thomas). but also, jesus said that the works that he did, those that believe on him will also do them, and even geater works than those. the miraculous shouldnt be necessary for believers, because the crowd awed by miracles were fickle. but at the same time we should still expect miracles to be taking place somewhere. after all, jesus did promise this to his believers\n \n \nJust as in Biblical times, there have always been cynics and skeptics who too witnessed miracles but never attributed them to God.

Theists though do not hold such a high opinion of mankind's ability one day to understand all mysteries.\n\n once again we agree. the issue is not about explaining mysteries, but more on whether these mysteries are based in truth to begin with. i mean, an event such as manna falling from the clouds totally defies all possible logic. striking a rock in the middle of the desert with a stick should never produce a stream of water. and theres no way science should explain a water-soaked stone alter suddenly spontaneously combusting. events like these will forever be mysteries IF they occured. the question is: DID THEY OCCUR? and if they did, why have they stopped occuring?",

When Mary Magdalene went to tell them that He arose from the dead they had to go see for themselves. Think about it: After He had performed all the miracles in their presence; still they had to check out that woman&#8217;s story. And another thing to think about<b></b>: If Mary Magdalene was so convinced, why did she take funereal aromatics to anoint the body of Christ if she knew He was resurrected? What did all those miracles do for even those closest to Him? What good would they do today? More importantly: What sort of miracle would it take to believe in Christ, in the Gospel, in the Word of God?

   "Hi Paul: \n \n You ask some good questions here.\n \n \nYou wrote << If it were possible for any natural force to push against walls of water in opposite directions, and keep them apart, that wind would make it impossible for people and carts to pass through. if this feat was done, then it was undeniably God's doing.\n \n \n First off, note that Elohim is resting on this seventh day.\n \n \n\"Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. By the seventh day God completed His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.\" Gen. 2:1-3.\n\n \n Since God is the Creator of the universe, then the fact that He simply created the stars and planets is no real miracle. It is here that the Lord God takes over to begin His priestly work on this Sabbath Day. \n \n \n\"This is the account of the heavens and the earth ['land,' i.e., the land of the garden] when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth [land; Eden] and heaven [the spiritual equivalent of Eden].\" Gen. 2:4. \n \n \n Eden, then, existed in the physical and spiritual realm, and Adam was able to travel within both realms, until the fall. \n \n \nPaul << And even with no evidence left to show that God could possibly manifest such power, it doesnt prove that it didnt occur. the greatest proof against miracles in the past is a lack of miracles in the present.\n \n \n This is the part that inspired my reply. There is a reason that God does not manifest His power in the form of miracles today. The Lord is currently replacing the dark heavenly hosts (spiritual forces of wickedness; Eph. 6:13) with members of the body of Christ. We are being gathered through the 'gospel of the grace of God' (Acts 20:24), which Paul calls \"my gospel.\" Rom. 2:16, 16:25, etc.. Paul writes, \n \n \n\"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.\" Eph. 2:8-10\n.\n \n If God went around performing miracles today, then your faith would be based upon those works, and not upon the 'faith of Jesus'. Rom. 3:26. Paul says, \n \n \n\"For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he {already} sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it.\" Rom. 8:24+25.\n\n \n So the Lord God has not revealed His hand by performing great signs and wonders in the world for the past 2000 years. However, 'after these things' (Acts 15:16) the kingdom of Israel shall be restored, and the great signs and wonders shall again become manifested upon this planet. Remember that Israel is waiting for Elijah to come and restore all things. Malachi 4:5+6, Matt. 17:11, Mark 9:12, etc.. He will have the power over rain and drought (1Kings 17:1), to raise the dead (1Kings 17:22), the fire from heaven (1Kings 18:38), and the power to divide the rivers (2Kings 2:8). Even Christ Himself did not display all the powers of Elijah. \n \n \nPaul << How is it that people are to believe that such demonstrations of magnicence in the world is only restricted to the distant past? was God closer to the earth in those days? was his manifestation more necessary? has his miracle working power depleted?\n\n \n Not at all. The answers to your questions are in your Bible. It is necessary for you to find out where we are today in reference to God's overall plan. How can God justify the ungodly, according to a gospel message, in the presence of great signs and wonders? Surely you can see that this would be quite impossible. No sir. He must sit behind the scenes and allow these things to run their natural course. Then, at the judgment, everyone was treated fairly. Those who really did believe His Word did so, by faith. Those who choose not to believe have the same opportunities as the rest of us. These things must be done in this way, \"so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has the faith of Jesus.\" Rom. 3:26.\n \n \nPaul << God's only manifestation, even in those days, were his wonderous works. noone could see God's form or even be in his physical vicinity and live. but a massive pillar of flame or smoke and food falling out of the sky was undeniable evidence that God was with you. if a modern day scientist was walking through the wilderness with these israelites, and saw the phenomenon described in exodus, then there would be no problem for him to acknowledge forces beyond the laws of physics\n\n \n We agree. You are talking about the 'pillar of fire,' and the 'pillar of cloud.' Exodus 13:21+22, Numbers 14:14. The first is the witness of spirit, and the second the witness of water. The third witness was the rock (Exodus 17:6) that followed them. \"and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.\" 1Cor. 10:4. These are three witnesses of spirit, water and blood; and the three are into the One. 1John 5:8.\n \n \nPaul << In today's world, we have no current works of God to examine, and what's worse is that we have no evidence that the miracles of the bible ever happened. \n \n \n That is right. Therefore, God's people of faith will believe His Word, and the skeptics will not. Put yourself into God's position, and try to come up with a better plan to separate the faithful from His enemies. \n \n \nPaul << In fact, observable evidence is very often contrary to the stories in the bible. what is there to even suggest that God is even capable of what the bible says he did? and if God didnt or couldnt perform those works, what makes us think he can do anything as spectacular nowadays, particularly since he's not doing any lately?\n\n \n Things will look much differently on the other side of the veil we know as death. On the other side is no such thing as unbelievers. But, we will be judged on our actions on this side of the veil, where nobody could prove anything to be absolute. In truth, God and His Word represent the only game in town. If there is no God, then nothing waits for us beyond the veil. When we all wake up on the other side to be standing before Him, then I do not want to be standing in the shoes of one who denied His very existence. Who will have all the appearances of being stupid then? \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

However, 'after these things' (Acts 15:16) the kingdom of Israel shall be restored, and the great signs and wonders shall again become manifested upon this planet.

Even Christ Himself did not display all the powers of Elijah. \n\n this is interesting, and something ive heard of before, and i must say ive considered this. no evidence seem to suggest that this is going to happen anytime soon. palestine, for instance, seems to be holding on to a chunk of israel land that seems to be getting bigger, and instead if israel being restored, its being torn apart and chipped away at. if israel needs to be restored for miracles to start occuring, then we're probably hopeless, because that restoration itself requires a miracle\n \n \nNot at all.

Therefore, God's people of faith will believe His Word, and the skeptics will not. Put yourself into God's position, and try to come up with a better plan to separate the faithful from His enemies. \n\n again, in the past, israel was just among the unjust nations, all of which would have heard of their miraculuous exploits. yet they were shrouded in God's manifestation at every step of the way. and enemies still came against them. signs and wonders in today's world would justify both God's existence and his willingness to work with humans. so far we have nothing to work with but tales of questionable objectivity\n \n \nThings will look much differently on the other side of the veil we know as death. On the other side is no such thing as unbelievers. But, we will be judged on our actions on this side of the veil, where nobody could prove anything to be absolute.

Who will have all the appearances of being stupid then? \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral\n\n the thing is, everybody says that. we cant tell you that God is real, but when you die (never to return and be a witness to others) then you'll know whether you were right or wrong about God. the thing is, when you die, its a bit too late to just figure out whether you were wrong.\n \n one other pivotal point i made that you didnt address was the words of jesus in john 14: 12. jesus says that whoever believes on him will do the works that he did (of course, im sure you know what it says). how do you account for the apparent fact that nobody is doing any works like jesus did, even though there are so many \"believers\"?",

Non believers can always make a strong stand against any religous subject by simply stating to the believers \" prove it\" .

Was man created from dust or a ape ? Is there really a GOD ?? on and on and on. Man has been given a free will to make his own choice on what he/she chooses to believe, about any of these topics.

   "Good post, Greg. (I liked the part where our Knower knows&#8230; )\n \n In Hebrews 6 : 1 &#8211; 3  Therefore leaving the discussion of the elementary principles of Christ, let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, of the doctrine of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. And this we will do if God permits. \n \n I never was one (and am still not) who speaks of fire and brimstone, of impending doom &#8211; but the time is now to forget about things that the flesh requires of God, but what God requires of us.\n \n Miracles have their place and God knows when they are required, which can be as simple as restoring sight to a hobo in the far reaches of nowhere &#8211; where no one is a witness but that person and God &#8211; but which act can lead to salvation for many, many more. The miracles such as parting the seas, moving mountains, casting out demons, restoring life, etc., is more important in the spiritual realm than in the physical where it can be explained away, taking away the glory of God, towards God and for God &#8211; nailing Christ again to the cross.\n Besides it is not against flesh and blood that we fight, but against the powers of darkness of the unseen world.\n \n Again, thanks for the inspiration, Greg.",

   "the thing is, i understand how faith works (thats probably part of the problem), i have seen accounts of people steadfastly convinced of God's power in their lives. they acknowledge God for everything, from waking at mornings to making their first million in real estate. and they believe in the miraculous and percieve daily favor and goodwill of God in their lives. such a life is filled with esteem and confidence, which in turn actually makes you more successful, level-headed and joyous. it works, no question about it\n \n however, it was fisher_of_man that said that discovering the truth about God is something you dont want to be wrong about. i agree, and i always held that view.\n \n for inquisitive people, faith doesnt fit well (it may be referred as a small measure of faith). faith demands that you drop the questions and just believe. of course, if they \"just believe\", then everything would be just fine. but the inquiring mind is still there, trying to figure out HOW and WHY faith works, and in the process killing the effect of faith\n \n i guess you cant have it both ways. either you never figure out how faith works, and it works, or you try to prefect it by using logic, and it doesnt work\n \n \n \n anyway, back to the probing :)\n \n based on the assumption that the bible is completely true, why isnt it in the least disturbing that the words of jesus in john 14:12 are not being fulfilled? whats up with that?",

I dont think I have ever posted anywhere on here my confirmed belief in heaven or hell, just my feeling that there is a lighter and darker side in the afterlife life, one may live either by choice. To compare people that believe in, and follow Christ as a way of life, a life that makes them feel better about themselves, to the likes B.Spears, is way out of the ozone, imo. .. \n \n And yes, why has the religion/beliefs you mentioned above lived for centuries ? The answer lies in itself, that particular belief lets the person get in touch with his/her spirituality, a connection with their \"god\", expressed in MANY different ways, in various ceremonial gestures and religions. But , ALL acheiving tha same end, and that being, that person having their soul in harmony with the higher being/spirit, and acheiving the inner peace it renders onto them. ...\n \n I do not follow the Bible to the letter, so I guess I am a fence straddler of sorts. I take the bible for its inspirational reading and as a guideline for living, not what happens after death. People have a tendency to look at the Bible as a manual for how to find out who's going to be in the lake of fire. It is a book of inspiration, salvation and guide for living, it just has to put the outcome in there for whichever life one chooses. To me , if one will just live the Ten Commandments, I think they will be good standing for anything after death.. . :) \n Myself, along with millions of others can testify to the wrongdoings that have occurred under the \"Name of God\" as you testify to when you chose not to watch the telepreachers. I can see why in todays scientific world, where everything is \"proven\" , that one can find it easy to stay away from any affiliation at all with religion. But, God is doing that too, HE has give us HIS best mediator/teacher , His son, and HE told us the story, left us the instruction manual , and now its up to each one of us to do with it what we choose. good day, all jmo",

   "To unkerpaulie:\n ok, my question: did miracles ever really happen? and did jesus ever do miracles? and did he really bestow miraculous power on his disciples and \"he who believes\" on him?\n \n I believe that all the miracles happened as recorded in the Bible. I would ask that if you get the chance, that everyone reads a book called \"The Heavenly Man\" by Paul Hattaway. My mum brought the book and I have only just started reading it. It is the remarkable true story of how God took a young, half-starved boy from a poor village in China's Henan Province and used him mightily to preach teh gospel despite horrific opposition. Instead of focusing on the many miracles or experiences of suffering, however, Brother Yun prefers to emphsize the character and beauty of Jesus. Mum told me about one of Brother Yun's experiences that can only be described as a miracle.\n \n I'll write down a bit about it from the book \"The Heavenly Man\" that describes his miracle escape from the maximum security prison where he was held:\n \n \"As soon as I read these verses, apowerful vision suddenly came to me even though I was wide awake. I saw my wife Deling sitting beside me. She had just been released from prison and was preparing some medicine. She lovingly treated my wounds. I felt greatly encouraged and asked her, \"Have you been released?'\n She replied, \"Why don't you open the iron door?\"\n Before I could answer she walked out of the room and teh vision ended. The Lord spoke to me, \"This is the hour of your salvation.\"\n Immediately I knew this was a vision from the Lord, and that I was meant to try to escape\"..............\n \n \"It was now more than six weeks since my legs had been smashed. Even putting a little weight on them caused tremendous agony. But I believed God had told me in three diferent ways that I was to try to escape: through His Word, through the vision I'd recieved that morning, and through Brother Xu. \n \n I learned that when the Lord tells us to do something there is no time for discussion or rationale, regardless of the situation we face. When we are sure God has told us to act, as I was on this occasion, blind obedience is called for. Not to obey God implies that we are wiser than Him, and that we know better how to run our lives than He does. \n \n It was just before eight o'clock in the morning of 5 May 1997. To the natural mind, this time of day was the worst possible time to try and escape! There was normally so much activity throughout the prison, with all the guards at their posts. \n \n I shuffled out of my cell and walked towards the locked iron gate in the hallway. My mind was solely focused on obeying God. I looked straight ahead and prayed beneath my breath with every step I took. A guard who pushed a button when he wanted the gate to open and close sat at the top of the third-floor stairwell...At the exact moment I reached the gate, another servant of the Lord, Brother Musheng, was returning to his cell and the gate was opened for him. That morning he had been order to sweep the prison courtyard. As Musheng passed me I told him, \"Wait! Don't close the gate.\" I walked through without even breaking my stride! The Lord's timing was perfect!... There had been a guard accompanying Musheng back to his cell, but at the exact moment he opened the gate for Musheng, a telephone rang in an office down the hallway and the guard turned and ran to answer it. \n \n I noticed a broom leaning against the wall in the stairwell. I picked it up and continued walking with it down the stairs to the second floor. An armed guard was positioned at his desk facing the second ifron gate. That gate was sometimes left open. Because an on-duty guard was assigned to watch the gate day and night, it wasn't considered a risk to leave it unlocked. At that moment the Holy Spirit spoke to me, \"Go now! The God of Peter is your God!\"\n \n Somehow the Lord seemed to blind that guard. He was staring directly at me, yet his eyes didn't acknowledge my presence at all. I expected him to say something, but he just looked through me as if I was invisible!\n He didn't say a word. I continued past him and didn't look back. I knew I could be shot in the back at any moment. I continued to silently ask the Lord to be ready to recieve my spirit, thinking these moments were to be my last in this world. \n \n I continued walking down the stairs, but nobody stopped me and none of the guards said a word to me!\n When I arrived at the main iron gate leading out to the courtyard I discovered it was already open! This was strange, as it was usually the most secure gate of all. There were normally two guards stationed at teh first-floor gate, one on the inside and one on the outside, but for some reason neither of the guards were present and the gate was open!\n \n I discarded the broom I had carried with me from the third floor and walked out into the courtyard. The bright morning light made me wince. I walked past several guards in the yard but nobody said a word to me. I then strolled through the main gate of the prison, which for some strange reason was also standing ajar!\n \n My heart was pounding! I was now standing on the street outside the Zhengzhou Number One Maximum Security Prison! I was told later nobody had ever escaped from that prison before. Immediately a small yellow taxi-van pullled up next to me and the driver - a man in his late 20s - opened the passenger door. He asked, \"Where are you heading?\" \n I got in and replied, \"I need to go to my office as quickly as possible, so please drive fast.\" I gave the driver the address of a Christian family I knew in Zhengzhou and we drove away from the prison......\"\n \n \"The precious Christian family warmly welcomed me inside their home. One of the daughters told me, \"The whole church has been fasting and praying for you and your co-workers for more than a week. Yesterday the holy Spirit told my mother, \"I will release Yun and the first place he will stop will be your home. He will stay for a short time and will pray with you. My parents told us to expect your arrival and we have organized a secret place for you to hide.\" We also find out in a few lines that the Lord healed his feet and legs!\n \n Brother Yun is living proof that miracles do happen.\n Curtsey of The Heavenly Man by Paul hattaway (Monarch Books). This is an absolutely amazing book and I would invite both atheists and theists alike to read it! This extract is only a small amount of Brother Yun's remarkable story.",

   "To unkerpaulie:\n the words say that anyone who believes on jesus will be given the power to do the works jesus did, as well as greater works than his.  \n \n The section in which the verse is in is under the title of \"Jesus the Way to the Father\". It is in this section when Jesus says \"I am the way and the truth and the life. No-one comes to the Father except through me. If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well.\"\n \n Verse 12 says:\n I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.\"\n \n Well, what was He doing? He was trying to get people to believe in who He was, and why He came down to Earth, i.e. to take away the sin of the world (John 1:29), as well as telling people about His Father. In John 5:45 Jesus states:\n  But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?\"\n \n What book did Moses write? Interestingly enough, it was Genesis, but this forms another argument. We are also told by the Lord to go and make witnesses of the nations of the World. I think that getting others to believe in the wonderful, merciful Lord Jesus Christ so that they will have eternal life and fellowship with our Lord when he returns and creates a new Heaven and new Earth where there will be no death, no pain, no suffering, is what Jesus was getting at when He was saying \"anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing\". The world will be restored to how it was originally as recorded in Genesis - a perfect place.\n \n Think about it, we now have the whole Bible, we can reach every country on Earth and proclaim the Good News to all nations on Earth. While, Jesus could only reach those in the area around which He lived and travelled. Jesus made the ultimate sacrifice by dying on the cross for our sins, both yours and mine, so that we may come to God with the penalty for our sin already paid through the blood of Jesus and live eternally with Him. Jesus did not stay dead, He had risen from the dead and conquered death so that we could return to God if we believed and trusted in His Son, Jesus. It is up to us Christians to tell the world about the sacrifice the He made out of love so that people may be saved. This could be the \"and even greater things\" that Jesus was talking about. Every Christian lives to testify to love and to be a witness for the Lord and to save those who are lost so that they may not perish and suffer for all eternity.\n \n Of course, there could be deeper meaning. This is how I take it however.",

   "To unkerpaulie:\n I went to the night meeting last night at the local Salvation Army. They have three strips at the front with the following words written on each strip:\n * Save souls.\n * Grow Saints.\n * Serve suffering humanity.\n \n These are the purpose of Christians and the Chruch as a whole. Did Jesus not do these as well? Although He could only minister to those around Him, as described we can do much more work and proclaim the Gospels around the whole world. Many brave missionaries risk their lives trying to proclaim the message of the Gospels to anti-Christian countries. Radio-waves also help us to acheive this, as does modern technology.",

   "To unkerpaulie:\n I agree that this true story event is not similar in terms of when Jesus brought people from the dead, made a blind man see, but it is a miracle. In China, if you are a known Christian you are in big trouble. The Chinese soldiers would have shot Brother Yun on the spot if they saw him trying to escape, remember that China is vastly different to the higher standards of America and Australia, for example. \"Blinding\" not one guard but many guards so Brother Yun could slip past them without alerting their attention, the taxi arriving right on time (i.e. as soon as he escaped) and the Christian family who were ready for his return with clothes, food and a safe house prepared... If it was only one guard, I might agree with you. But for a Christian to walk out a maximum secruity Chinese jail without even being noticed (even when he passed well armed guards) and without being shot at is nothing short of a miracle. \n \n You cannot really compare what Jesus did to what God did for Brother Yun, God provided everything that Brother Yun needed. God provides people's needs, Brother Yun's was different to Jesus' that was different to Peters. They were also in different circumstances and had different tasks to carry out and different purposes. We will have to keep this in mind. People have to take it by faith that Jesus was who He claimed He was, and did the miracles recorded, but those who do not believe must take it by blind faith that Jesus did not do any of the miracles and was not the Son of God. God's healing of Brother Yun's busted leg is also similar in essense to Jesus' healing of crippled people. \n \n 1. it can be explained in natural terms\n \n I would like to see you give this one an attempt... There is no possible way that natural phenomenon (i.e. anything without the assistance of God) could account for the guards not being able to see Brother Yun when he walked past them with them looking at him. Brother Yun was not rich enough to pay for many guards to let him go... \n \n 2. it can only be witnessed by one person\n \n Yes, in this case only Brother Yun was the witness - other wise the guards would have shot him. \n \n 3. it is not replicable\n \n Interestingly enough, in Acts 3, Peter heals a crippled beggar - similar to what happened to Brother Yun when his busted leg was healed by God. It is also interesting to note that a similar thing happened in Acts 12, titled \"Peter's Miraculous Escape From Prison\". Except in this, God himself did not send messages as He did Brother Yun, He sent an angel to assist Peter. \n Verse 10 says:\n \"They passed the first and second guards and came to iron gate leading to the city.\"\n This implies that the guards took no notice of him - \"Peter just didn't appear on their scanners\", so to speak. The exactly the same thing happened with Brother Yun. He also went to a friendly house, that of Mary the mother of John. Herod also made a through search for made to find Peter, which did not find him. The Chinese guards also cut off streets and made an unsuccessful search in the surrounding blocks for Brother Yun.\n \n I think that parallels can be made between the stories of the Bible and Brother Yun's experience, which implies that this is proof of miracles being made back then.",

   "To Dzeron:\n Correct me if I'm wrong, but I heard that Jesus made friends with some fishermen before he did the fish-multiplying gig. Suspicious...\n \n Oops, boy am I slow today <embarrassed look<. The only such miracle is nder the title of \"Jesus feeds the five thousand\". This can be found in each of the Apostle's books (i.e. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John). From John 6:5-9 we learn the desperate situation:\n When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming towards Him, He said to Philip, \"Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?\" He asked this only to test him, for He already had in mind what He was going to do.\n Philip answered Him, \"Eight months' wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!\"\n Another of His desciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up, \"Here is a boy with five small barely loaves and two small fish, but how far wil they go among so many?\"\n \n In Luke 9:12 we read:\n \"Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to Him and said, \"Send the crowd away so tey can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.\" \n \n So they were in a remote place, how could they have carted thousands to tens of thousands of fish to the spot?? Where could have all that bread have come from on such short notice? The Bible said that Jesus gave thanks for it and distributed it to those who were seated as much as they wanted (cf. John 6:11) Basically what Jesus did would be able to feed my whole town where I live (about 6,000 people - as we learn that there were plenty leftovers). There would not be that much fish in the part of town where the Twelve were originally fishing. Besides, they couldn't catch that much fish in one day - the whole fishing business would have been devestated! Your argument just doesn't really work in the real world.",
