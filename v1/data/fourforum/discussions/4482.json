   "Well, you are wrong, of course. Simeon bar Kochba actually came closer to the Jewish requirements for a messiah. You have to remember, that the Jewish concept of the Messiah is much different than the Christian concept.\n \n In the Jewish concept, the Messiah is going to be just a man, not the 'son of god', or god. There are specfic things that have not been accomplished yet that will be this messiahs tasks... which I think will never will be accomplished personally. \n \n In the Jewish religion, a messiah (or annointed one), was either the King or the High Priest. The concept of \"The Messiah\" came about during the time when forgien kings have taken over the rulership of Judah, and grew from the hope of having their own homegrown king, rather than having it imposed from without.\n \n If Jesus was anything beside a person whose life was distorted by myth and legend, he might be considered a failed messiah. Not a god, not the son of god, but just a man.\n \n And, yes, in the view of the Jewish religion, you don't have a case for the Christian religion as it stands now. That is absolutely correct. Reality does not stop belief though.\n\n actually, the jewish cultural expectation for a messiah is really irrelevant. for the christian religion, jesus was required to be God, the son of God, and the christ. even if he didnt meet the jewish expectations, he wasnt necessarily supposed to. and the jewish opinion about him would obviously have no bearing on his divinity",

The visions he receives there thus appear to provide insight into events in Judea in later centuries. But the literary setting is not the setting in which the book was actually written. The fact that ch. 11 obviously refers to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the Selucid ruler from Syria, makes it clear that the book took its final form during Antiochus' persecution of the Jews, which began with the desecration of the temple in 167 BCE. -- NRSV Study Bible\n \n The arguments for a date [of Daniel] shortly before the death of Antiochus IV Epiphanes in 164 are overwhelming. An author living in the 6th century could hardly have written the late Hebrew used in Dan, and its Aramaic is certainly later than the Aramaic of the Elephantine papyri, which date from the end of the 5th century. His historical perspective, often hazy for events in the time of the Babylonian and Persian kings but much clearer for the events during the Seleucid dynasty, indicates the Hellenistic age. Finally, his detailed description of the profanation of the temple in Jerusalem by Antiochus in 167 and the following persecution (9:27; 11:30-35) indicates a composition date shortly before the death of this king in 164. -- New Jerome Bible Commentary (Roman Catholic)",

   "hmmm... lets see if we can get back on track\n \n i started this thread because i have an ongoing issue against the concept of evolution and christianity coexisting. christianity, by its very nature, directly opposes evolution. some people apparently disagree\n \n we've established that jesus referenced from the genesis account of the creation of the world, indicating that he considered the genesis creation story as true. we've also established that according to the gospels, jesus claimed continuously that he was God, and that he was the messiah that the jews awaited. christianity is founded upon the concept that jesus is God, that he everything he said is true, and that jesus indeed raised from the dead and will gather his saints into paradise eternally. a christian, by definition, is one believes in jesus christ and who follows his teachings. in order for christianity to be valid, it must be presumed that jesus was who he said he was, and everything jesus said was true\n \n how is it that jesus considered the genesis creation account as true, when we know that it is not? how could jesus not know that the genesis story was \"only and allegory\"?",

   "I've seen nothing in anyone's posts that makes a compelling case that Genesis isn't true.\n\n \n I've given you this before, perhaps you forgot?\n \n The reader must understand that the Torah contains a great variety of material: laws, narratives, history, folk tales, songs, proverbial sayings, poetry, and, in the early parts of Genesis, myths and legends.\n \n Contemporary readers are often put off because they have been exposed to a method of biblical interpretation which understands the text in a literal way. Thus, if Genesis says that God created woman out of the rib of man, or tells of a serpent speaking, or of ancient man living several hundred years, the literalist interprets the story to mean precisely what the words convey. The contemporary reader familiar with the history and nature of the text will have to remember that a literal understanding of the Torah may lead to grave misconceptions. -- The Torah, A Modern Commentary, Union of American Hebrew Congregations Pub., New York \n \n \nI doubt Jesus (God) Himself is a fool about it either.\n\n \n Mr 13:32 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. \n \n Wherein Jesus tells us that he does not know everything that the Father knows.",
