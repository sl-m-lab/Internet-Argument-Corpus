   "The biggest problem created by uncontrolled illegal immigration is wage suppression. According to economics professor George Borjas, immigration reduces the average annual earnings of U.S.-born men by an estimated $1,700, or roughly 4%. (See Yahoo News story: Illegal Workers Have Mixed Impact.) If that reduction is applied to the roughly 135 million employed Americans, that reduces aggregate annual worker income by $230 billion, or $0.23 trillion. That's roughly 2% of our $12 trillion GDP. That's a loss in consumer spending of $230 billion (less taxes). Given that our entire GDP growth in 2005 was $384 billion, this is a significant amount. Considering that consumer spending is approximately 70% of GDP, that makes the \"growth\" in consumer spending around $269 billion. \n \n Again, the loss of that $230 billion is no small amount. And it is also $230 billion less money that could have been taxed, costing the Federal government anywhere between $36-55 billion per year. (Increasing the taxable income of a single taxpayer making $35,000/year by $1700 increases Federal income tax by $413. Increasing taxable income of a married taxpayer filing making $35,000/year by $1700 increases Federal income tax by $267. Multiplying these numbers by 135 million amounts to $55.7 billion and $36 billion, respectively.) \n \n Right-wingers will argue that this wage suppression is offset by business profits, and that these profits fuel investment. But investment capital is OVER-abundant at present. Increasing this excess even further will not result in more capital investment. It will result in higher CEO salaries, further overinvestment in the stock market, and further investment in foreign production facilities, the latter of which puts even further downward pressure on American wages. \n \n Furthermore, business profits don't fuel consumer spending. And consumer spending is the engine that drives our economy, not investment. Without consumer spending, there are no returns on investment. And if no returns are anticipated on investment, no investment takes place. \n \n The immigration-fueled reduction in wages does NOT help our economy. It hurts it. It reduces aggregate consumer income and the consumer spending it finances. The reduction in consumer spending reduces consumer production demand, further reducing demand for the labor to provide that production. The reduction in labor demand drives down employment and wages. The resultant labor demand reduction further reduces aggregate consumer income and further reduces consumer purchasing power. \n \n As consumer buying power declines, so do investment opportunities, since those opportunities are created by consumer demand for production. Thus the increased profits resulting from reduction in labor costs create even more excess capital, while reducing investment opportunities still further. \n \n Does anyone really think that wage suppression is \"good\" for the economy? Doesn't someone have to purchase the goods produced for business to profit? Won't reducing consumer income also reduce consumer goods purchasing? Won't a decline in consumer goods purchasing reduce business revenues and reduce potential profits? Once again, is immigration-fueled reduction in worker/consumer income really \"good\" for the economy?\n \n unlawflcombatnt\n \n EconomicPopulistCommentary\n \n Economic Patriot Forum\n \n ______________________\n Capitalism cannot function without consumer income. The benefits of capital investment are limited by consumers' ability to buy the products of capital investment. \n \n There must be balance between the \"means of consumption\" and the \"means of production.\"",

And at the same time eventually suppress US wages to a point where we (US) again become competitive in a global market? \n \n GDP, the measure of economic health presented by government and worshiped by tame economists and the general public, is already so cooked by debt, Iraq expenses and other supplemental spending that we haven't had true economic growth in years. Those consumer expenditures driving economic 'growth' are based on debt, as are government expenditures. What's the cap on debt servicing ability in this false economy? Isn't that the true limitation of expenditures in a debt driven economy? \n \n I don't picture immigrants amassing personal debt to drive the economy. If they find jobs, and that's the only reason they'd come here, then that would be a positive GDP transaction unencumbered by debt. As to eventually competing with non-immigrants and suppressing wages, good, I'm all for getting our standard of living where it should be in a global society. Let them assimilate into US society ASAP. Maybe it will force the US into long-range planning for survival instead of living like a drunken sailor from paycheck to paycheck.",

   "U.S. Firms Recruit Cheap Labor in Mexico By JULIE WATSON and OLGA R. RODRIGUEZ, Associated Press Writers \n 2 hours, 14 minutes ago\n \n \n SASABE, Mexico - When Pedro Lopez Vazquez crossed illegally into the United States last week, he was not heading north to look for a job. He already had one. \n \n His future employer even paid $1,000 for a smuggler to help Vazquez make his way from the central Mexican city of Puebla to Aspen, Colo.\n \n \"We're going to Colorado to work in carpentry because we have a friend who was going to give us a job,\" Vazquez said.\n \n Vazquez, 41, was interviewed along the Arizona border after being deported twice by the U.S. Border Patrol. He said he would keep trying until he got to Aspen.\n \n His story is not unusual. A growing number of U.S. employers and migrants are tapping into an underground employment network that matches one with the other, often before the migrants leave home.\n \n \"It continues to become clear who controls immigration: It's not governments, but rather the market,\" said Jorge Santibanez, director of the Tijuana-based think-tank Colegio de la Frontera Norte.\n \n As debate over immigration heats up in the United States, more and more U.S. companies in need of cheap labor are turning to undocumented employees to recruit friends and relatives back home, and to smugglers to find job seekers.\n \n Darcy Tromanhauser, of the nonprofit law project Nebraska Appleseed, said companies in need of workers rely on the networks to \"pass along the information more effectively than billboards.\"\n \n \"It started out more explicitly, where (meatpacking) companies used to have buses to transport people to come up, and they would advertise directly in Mexico,\" she said. \"Now I think that happens more informally.\"\n \n At the same time, it has become less risky for companies to recruit illegal migrants. Since the Sept. 11 terror attacks, U.S. prosecution of employers who hire such workers has dwindled to a trickle as the government puts its resources toward national security.\n \n The few cases that are prosecuted, however, highlight how lucrative a business recruiting undocumented workers has become. In one case, a single smuggler allegedly earned $900,000 over 15 months placing 6,000 migrants in jobs at Chinese restaurants across the upper Midwest.\n \n Shan Wei Yu, a 51-year-old Chinese-American, was sentenced in December to nine years in federal prison on charges involving the transportation of 40 of those migrants. Investigations involving the others continue.\n \n Rick Hilzendager, special agent for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Grand Forks, N.D., said Yu connected 6,000 migrants from Latin America with jobs in Chinese restaurants in Illinois, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n \n Based in Yu's home in McKinney, Texas, the Great Texas Employment Agency placed ads in Chinese-language newspapers in the Chicago area offering cheap labor from Latin America, investigators said.\n \n Yu sent a recruiter with Spanish interpreters to find migrants in Dallas willing to be fry cooks and dishwashers, Hilzendager said. A team made up mostly of illegal Chinese immigrants rented cars and drove them up.\n \n Yu allegedly charged a $150 finder's fee for each migrant while the drivers earned $300 per worker. Restaurant owners deducted the $450 from workers' first-month paychecks of $1,000.\n \n \"It was just so easy,\" Hilzendager said.\n \n Nick Chase, assistant U.S. attorney in North Dakota, said Yu even offered to replace workers free of charge if one left within two weeks of starting. \n \n \"It was a 2-for-1 special - like a pizza,\" Chase said. \"Everything about it was ugly.\" \n \n The employees, housed in cramped apartments provided by employers, worked 14-hour days and had little outside contact. The case broke open in August 2004 after two Mexican migrants working at the Buffet House in Grand Forks fled poor conditions and were picked up along a highway by Border Patrol agents. \n \n Many of the drivers involved in the scheme were deported to China. Two North Dakota restaurant owners were sentenced to four months each for harboring illegal immigrants. \n \n But many migrants, and many employers, say the recruiters provide a valuable service. Sergio Sosa, who organizes Nebraska meatpackers, said many are seen as heroes in the Mexican towns where the workers come from. \n \n Sosa, speaking by telephone from Omaha, said that in the 1990s companies bused migrants from the U.S.-Mexico border, paying them room and board plus salaries of $100 a week. But after a government crackdown, they began to rely more on their workers to recruit friends and family back in Mexico. \n \n \"One of the meatpacking supervisors is from Michoacan, and most of the people working for him come from his town,\" Sosa said. \"There's no official recruiting - it's more internal through family.\" \n \n Migrants setting out along the border confirmed his account. Guadalupe Mendez, 26, said her sister found her work as a seamstress in Los Angeles. Lorenzo Garcia Ruiz, 38, said friends arranged a gardening job for him in Kentucky. \n \n To make a real dent in this network, the U.S. government would need to go after employers or make them pay the costs of legalizing workers, migration activists say. \n \n But an August 2005 report of the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, indicates the opposite is happening. After the Sept. 11 attacks, work-site inspections by U.S. immigration officials plummeted as they focused on national security cases. \n \n From 1999 to 2004, the number of businesses that faced fines dropped from 417 to three, the GAO said. Data after 2004 could not be compared because the government changed the way it records data. \n \n Investigators say fake documents makes it difficult to prove an employer has knowingly hired an undocumented worker. The business community argues that employers aren't equipped to spot fraud and warns that more investigations could lead to workplace discrimination. \n \n Chase said businesses must be kept in check. \n \n \"There are employers out there who are always going to be tempted by the bottom line,\" he said. \n \n ________\n Associated Press writer Julie Watson reported this story from Mexico City and AP writer Olga R. Rodriguez reported from Sasabe, Mexico.\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060415/ap_on_bi_ge/mexico_waiting_jobs_2;_ylt=AmbmTRYgibSOME587EIEYCNQuk0A;_ylu=X3oDMTBiMW04NW9mBHNlYwMlJVRPUCUl",

We've become a fat, lazy, indulged country from our single party politicians using public money to buy votes. Until we run out of money, a guest worker program is the only reasonable solution.",
