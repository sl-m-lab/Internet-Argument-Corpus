Anarchy is the absence of any form of political authority. It is not a culture state, it is indeed a political state. For example, a group of animals in the forest might live in anarchy because they have no political authority. However, there is no reason to believe that this group of animals has attained some cultural state that has made laws superfluous, it simply means that they have not yet evolved enough as a society to create a political authority for the benefit of everyone.\n \n While it may be true that if a society becomes culturally perfect, they will no longer need laws and can resort to anarchy, it is not necessarily the case that anarchy is only present in a culturally perfect society.

Politics, as a subject, in not applicable to animals. \n \n Anarchy is very much a cultural state rather than a political state, because the absence of political authority in an anarchist society is like the absence of political authority in a forest full of animals, non-applicable. It is not a case of a group of people getting together and arriving at a political consensus to live without political authority, but rather a group of people living without political authority because their culture precludes it. \n \nWhile it may be true that if a society becomes culturally perfect, they will no longer need laws and can resort to anarchy, it is not necessarily the case that anarchy is only present in a culturally perfect society. But I should reinforce this point: anarchy is the absence of political authority, not a cultural state of perfection.\n I'm not claiming that anarchy is \"culturally perfect\" nor \"a cultural state of perfection\". Instead I'm pointing out that in order for a society to be without political authority, political authority must be culturally un-necessary. Any attempt to discard the institution of political authority in an archic culture simply leads to a power struggle as the vaccuum in the culture is filled. Such a struggle is anarchic only in the pejorative sense, much like we might call any opinion we don't like \"liberal\".\n \nHarm is not what contravenes legally recognized rights; it is that which lowers the happiness of a person or persons.\n Utilitarian schemes of \"happiness\" and \"utility\" are notorious for their lack objectivity, which is why much more useful deontological rights are used to determine harm in a liberal society. If you want to define harm in terms of happiness, then you're working according to the wrong political system. In order that any definition of harm not fall to issues of relativism, it must be politically defined in terms of rights for it to have objective status. \n \nI should also mention that not all political rights are protected by the Constitution but by laws passed by the legislature, and thus a law that violates a political right might not be unconstitutional.\n A law that violates a political right in this manner would simply be a case of conflicting laws, and the conflict would have to be decided through the application of constitutional law. \n \nAgain, you are working with the wrong definition of anarchy, so it is understandable why you might misinterpret what I've said. Also mention that removing usless or harmful laws should not qualify as \"dismantling\" the state, for the ultimate goal is to institute only the necessary laws to make the state work, not to slowly remove government alltogether.\n I beg to disagree. I am working under a very good definition of anarchy. For one thing, it does not confuse anarchism with liberalism. Removing un-necessary laws is a liberal activity, rather than an anarchic one.\n \nI am not quite certain what your suggestion here is. It is my opinion, however, that in a liberal state, the best way to protect rights is to deny the government the ability to create laws which violate those rights. Whether that is best accomplished by enumerating things which the government is not allowed to do or by listing only the powers that the government is allowed is a different discussion, I think.\n I'm not suggesting anything.

If he were truly personally ignorant, then his position requires him to get informed before proclaiming that giving rights to one set of people would undermine civilization. \n \n The Church is fully aware of the dishonesty of its position. So is Benedict.",

   "A group of animals in the forest doesn't have a body politic, and to refer to them as living in anarchy is a category mistake that trades on the amphiboly of the term \"anarchy\". Politics, as a subject, in not applicable to animals.\n\n \n I see no reason that politics should not be applicable to animals, indeed some animals do live in forms of political systems, and even if they did not, it would not be inappropriate to point out their lack of political system using a term such as \"anarchy\". The fact that they do not have a body politic is the definition of anarchy if we use my definition of the word.\n \n \nAnarchy is very much a cultural state rather than a political state, because the absence of political authority in an anarchist society is like the absence of political authority in a forest full of animals, non-applicable. It is not a case of a group of people getting together and arriving at a political consensus to live without political authority, but rather a group of people living without political authority because their culture precludes it. \n I'm not claiming that anarchy is \"culturally perfect\" nor \"a cultural state of perfection\". Instead I'm pointing out that in order for a society to be without political authority, political authority must be culturally un-necessary. Any attempt to discard the institution of political authority in an archic culture simply leads to a power struggle as the vaccuum in the culture is filled. Such a struggle is anarchic only in the pejorative sense, much like we might call any opinion we don't like \"liberal\".\n\n \n I continue to disagree with your definition of anarchy. Anarchy makes no mention of the reasons that a society lives without political authority; it is merely the lack of a political authority. Anarchy does describe only a group of people whose culture precludes political authority, for it might as easily describe a group of people who are temporarily without political authority or a group of people who are not knowledgable enough or assertive enough to form a political authority.\n \n Looking at the definitions I have at hand,\n \n Dictionary.com says:\n \n 1. Absence of any form of political authority. \n 2. Political disorder and confusion. \n 3. Absence of any cohesive principle, such as a common standard or purpose. \n \n Webster.com says:\n \n 1 a : absence of government b : a state of lawlessness or political disorder due to the absence of governmental authority c : a utopian society of individuals who enjoy complete freedom without government\n 2 a : absence or denial of any authority or established order b : absence of order : DISORDER <not manicured plots but a wild anarchy of nature -- Israel Shenker<\n \n Wikipedia.org says:\n \n 1. Absence of any form of state. \n 2. \"The Anarchy\" is the name given a period of civil war and unsettled government in England during the reign of King Stephen of England. \n 3. Specific publications titled \"Anarchy.\" See Publications. \n \n The only definition I see there which might be mentioning a culture is \"a utopian society of individuals who enjoy complete freedom without government\", yet even that definition is describing a group of perfectly free people without laws, not a group of people whose culture has made laws superfluous.\n \n \nUtilitarian schemes of \"happiness\" and \"utility\" are notorious for their lack objectivity, which is why much more useful deontological rights are used to determine harm in a liberal society. If you want to define harm in terms of happiness, then you're working according to the wrong political system. In order that any definition of harm not fall to issues of relativism, it must be politically defined in terms of rights for it to have objective status. \n A law that violates a political right in this manner would simply be a case of conflicting laws, and the conflict would have to be decided through the application of constitutional law.\n\n \n Certainly I do not disagree that our law must be defined in terms of political rights held by the people (or perhaps be defined by limiting the actions of the government) in a very concrete fashion. But we do not decide those political rights and government restrictions on whatever whimsy strikes us at the moment, the reasoning behind those rights and restrictions must be ultimately aimed at the happiness of the people. And I certainly agree that happiness is not objective; that's why our laws are so controversial. But the moment we start deciding that a law which calls for the execution of Jews isn't harmful because we don't have a right to life listed in our Constitution, then that's the moment that we've forgotten what harm is. The political right granted by the government are intented to prevent harm; they do not determine whether something is harmful.\n \n \nI beg to disagree. I am working under a very good definition of anarchy. For one thing, it does not confuse anarchism with liberalism. Removing un-necessary laws is a liberal activity, rather than an anarchic one.\n I'm not suggesting anything. I'm pointing out that in a liberal state any changes to the legal system that protects rights involves rejigging the entire system. This is such that denying the gov't the ability to violate your rights will inevitably lead to the violation of other's rights.\n\n \n Simply because anarchy and liberalism both call for the removal of unnecessary laws do not mean they are confused. Liberalism may call for the removal of unnecessary laws, but anarchy calls for the removal of all laws.\n \n In a liberal state, a change to the legal system that protects right might involve rejigging the entire system, but then again, it might not. Furthermore, I will state that in a liberal system, denying the government the ability to violate your rights will usually not lead to the violation of other's rights. I'd have to request an explanation or an example of why you think this to be true. I should make my case using same-sex marriage, for preventing the government from using sex or sexual orientation as a means for denying marriage will not violate anyone else's rights.",

Anarchy describes a system in which there is no political authority; it is the lack of political authority that is important.\n Indeed, but how that lack or absence of political authority is realized is more important. If the system lacks something to hold political authority, then it is anarchic qua disordered authority. If the system lacks political authority such that nothing can have political authority, then it is anarchic qua anarchy.\n \nAll right, well it may be that the authors of those dictionaries have written definitions of the word \"anarchy\" that have been biased by their teaching and misunderstanding of the word.

Perhaps we can agree, at least, that this is the way the pope used the word.\n That's the thing about english dictionaries (unlike, say, french dictionaries) is they're empirical endeavors - simply reflecting current usage rather than any essential meaning. They also tend towards circular definitions, usually after about seven entries or so the definitions come in a circle. J.L. Austin noted that dictionaries are the 'first word' in meaning, and any particular usage of a word needed some conceptual analysis for articulating that meaning.\n \nI consider both social and individual happiness, but an important point in this is that simply because my my country decides one thing would make them happy does not mean that is the best way to create social happiness.

Simply because a right isn't politically protected does not mean that violating that right is not harmful.\n No, it doesn't have to specifically be America or Jews, but the place and the people whose rights are being violated are simply variables according to any rights based system. All rights are politically protected, whether they are explicitly or implicitly expressed in law. I'm fairly confident that gay rights in the USA are implicitly protected by American Constitutional law, and particularly civil rights laws, by precedent.\n \nHmm, well I think when I wrote that, I was interpreting your statement: \"I beg to disagree.
