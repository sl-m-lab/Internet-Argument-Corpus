   "New Book, \"Where the Right Went Wrong,\" Due Out in August\n \n Buchanan promises his book will show how, \"A cabal* of neoconservatives inside and outside the administration hijacked U.S. foreign policy, beat the drums for war in Iraq, and may have ignited a 'war of civilizations' with the Islamic world that could last a generation.\"\n \n The book, \"Where the Right Went Wrong,\" is being rushed to publication to come out just before the Republican National Convention in August, where Buchanan will serve as an MSNBC commentator. The New York Post recently quoted a publishing \"insider\" as saying, \"They could put Michael Moore on the jacket of this book, and people would believe he wrote it.\"\n \n http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1 000556757\n \n * a group of persons secretly united to bring about an overturn or usurpation especially in public affairs; derives from Kabbalah (which has numerous spelling variations), the mystical interpretation of the Hebrew scripture.\n \n \n Related Thread:\n \n How to Identify Neoconservatives\n \n \n Related Thread: Both Nader and Buchanan Agree that Bush is a Zionist Tool:\n \n Pat Buchanan Interviews Ralph Nader\n \n \n \n \n .",

   "Buchanan Book Declares, \"No Conservative Party Left in Washington\"\n \n On Conservatives and Conservatism:\n \n \"There is no conservative party left in Washington. Conservative thinkers and writers who were to be the watchdogs of orthodoxy have been as vigilant in policing party deviations from principle as was Cardinal Law in collaring the predator-priests of the Boston archdiocese.\" (Page 9)\n \n \"The Beltway Right has entered into a civil union with Big Brother.\" (Page 176)\n \n \n On the Neoconservatives:\n \n \"Nine days after an attack on the United States, this tiny clique of intellectuals was telling the President of the United States...that if he did not follow their war plans, he would be charged publicly with a 'decisive surrender' to terrorism.\" (Page 48 )\n \n \"Kristol's warning that neoconservatives could go to Kerry was an admission of what many have long recognized. The neoconservatives are not really conservatives at all. They are impostors and opportunists.\" (Page 250) \n \n \n On the Bush Doctrine:\n \n \"[A] prescription for permanent war for permanent peace, though wars are the death of republics.\" (Page 6)\n \n The Bush National Security Strategy \"is the imperial edict of a superpower out to exploit its present supremacy to make itself permanent Lord Protector of the universe.\" (Page 26) \n \n \"This is democratic imperialism. This will bleed, bankrupt and isolate this republic. This overthrows the wisdom of the Founding Fathers about what America should be all about.\" (Page 35)\n \n \n On the War in Iraq:\n \n \"Listening to the neoconservatives, Bush invaded Iraq, united the Arab world against us, isolated us from Europe, and fulfilled to the letter bin Laden's prophecy as to what we were about. We won the war in three weeks -- and we may have lost the Islamic world for a generation.\" (Page 84)\n \n \n On the War on Terrorism:\n \n \"Terrorism is the price of empire. If we do not wish to pay it, we must give up the empire.\" (Page 237)\n \n \"We are not hated for who we are. We are hated for what we do. It is not our principles that have spawned pandemic hatred of America in the Islamic world. It is our policies.\" (Page 80)\n \n \"U.S. dominance of the Middle East is not the corrective to terror. It is a cause of terror. Were we not over there, the 9/11 terrorists would not have been over here.\" (Page 236)\n \n More:\n \n http://drudgereport.com/flashpb.htm\n \n \n \n \n .",
