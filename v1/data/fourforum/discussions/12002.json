   "Le Histoire de Saddam Hussein et le CIA:\n \nIn 1959, there was a failed assassination attempt on Qasim. The failed assassin was none other than a young Saddam Hussein. In 1963, a CIA-organized coup did successfully assassinate Qasim and Saddam's Ba'ath Party came to power for the first time. Saddam returned from exile in Egypt and took up the key post as head of Iraq's secret service. The CIA then provided the new pliant, Iraqi regime with the names of thousands of communists, and other leftist activists and organizers. Thousands of these supporters of Qasim and his policies were soon dead in a rampage of mass murder carried out by the CIA's close friends in Iraq....\n \n Iraqis have always suspected that the 1963 military coup that set Saddam Husain on the road to absolute power had been masterminded by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). New evidence just published reveals that the agency not only engineered the putsch but also supplied the list of people to be eliminated once power was secured--a monstrous stratagem that led to the decimation of Iraq's professional class.... The author reckons that 5,000 were killed, giving the names of 600 of them--including many doctors, lawyers, teachers and professors who formed Iraq's educated elite. The massacre was carried out on the basis of death lists provided by the CIA. \n\n Regime Change: How the CIA put Saddam&#39;s Party in Power",

Our own nation's actions on torture are a prime example.\n \n So while you are seeing \"birthing pains\", I am seeing people following the actions they want to follow, and will continue to want to follow.\n Of course, neither of us can predict the future.\n Quite frankly, if I am wrong, I welcome it. emoticon_xgood\n I just think Saddam was the product of many things that are still wrong in the area that have nothing to do with democracy.\n \n In our country, we have had Democracy for a LONG time now. The amount of time during which that allowed women to vote is SMALLER THAN the amount of time during which that democracy allowed women to vote. Amount of time with the 1964 civil rights act is MUCH smaller than the amount of time we didn't have it.\n \n \n \nThe US military in 2003 was light years ahead of the military of 1991. Also, we'd had 10 years to degrade his forces. Also, in 1991, if I recall, the UN hadn't authorized the forces to go into Iraq but in 2003 they did. Furthermore, he'd stopped cooperating with inspectors so we had to protect ourselves and others from potential WMD attacks (emoticon_xangel). And, of course, hindsight is always 20/20.\n\n I feel we are arguing on different wave-lengths.\n You are talking about prior justification (2003 invasion).\n I am talking about how the basis for the 2003 invasion was on false \"intel\".\n \n And don't get me wrong. I am entirely for saber-rattling.\n But crossing the line between saber-rattling and invasion is a very real line (IMO) that should not be taken lightly.\n \n Our saber-rattling DID GET inspectors in.\n BEFORE we invaded, inspectors WERE in Iraq. Reporting that he had no WMDs.\n We went in anyways.\n \n So, to make my position plain, I support Bush in his saber-rattling. He had every right to threaten Iraq / Saddam.\n It did get results.\n The sad part is that the results Bush's saber-rattling got are over-shadowed and ignored by the fact that he went in anyways.\n I can't help but think that if Bush had stopped at the saber-rattling, which got inspectors in, it would have been a political victory for him.\n As it is, we talk about how \"history\" will view Bush, cause we all know that the \"here-and-now\" ain't pretty. His own party bashes him with ease these days...\n \n (incidentally, in case there is any doubt on what I am saying, some people view \"saber-rattling\" as a negative thing. I don't. When I talk of it, I think of it as a potentially positive 'diplomatic' tool.)\n \n And, as you said: \"And, of course, hindsight is always 20/20.\" emoticon_xgood",
