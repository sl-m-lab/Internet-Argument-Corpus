The longer the housing boom lasts, the deeper the eventual downturn.\" \n \n The Coming Real Estate Collapse? \n .... Right now, housing prices are rising far more rapidly than personal incomes. The gap between housing prices and what a home can be rented for is rapidly widening as well. These are both ominous trends ... and history shows us that neither of these trends will go on forever. \n \n All bubbles - including real estate bubbles - happen when the price of an asset accelerates beyond its underlying value.

It is making real investors shy away.\n\n \n Man, is this the truth.\n \n My experience -\n \n Calgary is the center of Canada's oil patch, and with oil riding high, Calgary is seeing an unprecedented real estate boom. (When oil went in the tank in the mid-late 80s, you could buy entire subdivisions in Calgary for $1, just take over the mortgages and they were yours.)\n \n They can't build the houses fast enough. My brother, and my best friend both recently bought new houses, my brother's was about 2 years old, my friends was brand new. Both are way out on the outskirts of the city.\n \n I wouldn't pay half of what they paid, because the houses aren't worth it. They're structurally poor, sloppily built, and carelessly finished. They're modern, and they look great, from about 25'. Two year old houses on stable, well drained soil and bedrock, with cracks in the walls, and don't even get me started on the quality of the interior finish work. emoticon_mad \n \n I've actually talked to several people in the trades, a couple of them lifelong friends, that will no longer work for the big home builders, their consciences won't let them, and nor will their pocket books. Cut every corner, work 16hrs/day for 10hrs pay, and be treated like dirt for your trouble. They've all moved into residential renovation or small commercial companies.\n \n I renovated the basement of our place myself, completely gutted it - 50 year old concrete, and not a single crack. The entire place is built out of 2X4 and 2X6 Fir, actual plywood, and real plaster and brick. The house will easily stand for another 50 years, with ZERO problems.\n \n Not to blow my own horn, but I bought in an inner city neighborhood, a 5-10 minute commute to downtown. I searched it out thoroughly and found a neighborhood that was just on the cusp of a major rejuventation. The houses are bungalows, modest homes from around 800-1200 sq ft, on 60'x120' lots, built in the mid '50s. The area is zoned R2, both good and bad. It will never be \"prime\", but the lots can be subdivided, and houses can be rented. As it stands, the homes in our area have increased at an approx. 20% higher rate than the average, and the tide of new infills is rapidly marching my way - $$$$$$..\n \n I'm relatively new to the game, but I've heard a lot of the horror stories from the guys that lived through the oil crashes of the 70's and 80's, and IMHO, it's not if, it's when will it happen again. There'll be a lot of people with some serious problems.\n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. - I've got a cousin that owns a hardware store/lumber yard, and he'll swear up and down that today's OSB is actually superior in every way to plywood. :)",
