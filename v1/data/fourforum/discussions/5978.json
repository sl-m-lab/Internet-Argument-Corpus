   "Even without our \"covert support\", Allawi and our other hand picked guys had complete control of radio, newspapers, and television stations. Their adds ran free, andybody else paid $100,000 fro a 30 second spot. The fact that the aprties that too the election are pro iranian and generally anti US should send a pretty strong message to the American people regarding how our intervention is being viewed.\n \n Now we are being kept around to help the new governwemten consolidate power. Once they have the ability to rule Iraq with an iron fist every bit as tight as saddams, but under the close supervision of Tehran, we will just have to finish footing the bill for the invasion, then we will be free to leave.",
