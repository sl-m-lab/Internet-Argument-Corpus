   "LOS ANGELES-According to a report released Monday by the American Institute of Religions, the Church of Scientology, once one of the fastest-growing religious organizations in the U.S., is steadily losing members to the much newer religion Fictionology.\n \n \"Unlike Scientology, which is based on empirically verifiable scientific tenets, Fictionology's central principles are essentially fairy tales with no connection to reality,\" the AIR report read. \"In short, Fictionology offers its followers a mythical belief system free from the cumbersome scientific method to which Scientology is hidebound.\"\n \n Created in 2003 by self-proclaimed messiah Bud Don Ellroy, Fictionology's principles were first outlined in the self-help paperback Imaginetics: The New Pipe-Dream Of Modern Mental Make-Believe. \n \n Fictionology's central belief, that any imaginary construct can be incorporated into the church's ever-growing set of official doctrines, continues to gain popularity. Believers in Santa Claus, his elves, or the Tooth Fairy are permitted-even encouraged-to view them as deities. Even corporate mascots like the Kool-Aid Man are valid objects of Fictionological worship. \n \n \"My personal savior is Batman,\" said Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Greg Jurgenson. \"My wife chooses to follow the teachings of the Gilmore Girls. Of course, we are still beginners. Some advanced-level Fictionologists have total knowledge of every lifetime they have ever lived for the last 80 trillion years.\"\n \n \"Sure, it's total ********,\" Jurgenson added. \"But that's Fictionology. Praise Batman!\"\n \n http://www.theonion.com/news/index.php?issue=4119\n \n :p",
