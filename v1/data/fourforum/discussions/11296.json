   "http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=5197489&page=1\nA 16-year-old boy whose family relies on faith rather than medical treatment has died after suffering from stomach pain and shortness of breath, police said. \n \n Oregon parents chose prayer over medical attention for their 16-year-old son.Gladstone, Ore., police said the boy's relatives, members of the Followers of Christ Church, told police that he had refused medical treatment after becoming ill a week ago. Under state law, anyone over 14 has the right to refuse treatment. \n \n The 16-year-old, Neil Beagley, suffered from an inflammation in his urethra, a tube leading from his bladder, which made him unable to urinate, Deputy State Medical Examiner Dr. Clifford Nelson told ABC News affiliate KATU-TV in Portland. \n \n Beagley filled up with urine, and that eventually ruined his bladder, kidneys and heart, said Nelson. He called it \"an absolutely horrible way to die.\" \n \n The teen's condition could have been treated with the use of a catheter, however, Nelson said. \n",

Now you can lie to yourself all you want to, but I was following the News Daily as they tracked the disease back to those sex clubs and bath houses, which led to their closings, and the label that AIDS was the gay disease. So don't even try to lie to me in your usual sanctimonious style of insulting your way to being right. This disease may be in both communities today, but it wasn't when it started out.

This christian cult refused medical care for their young under all circumstances when only a cult would reject the miracle that our medical advancements are and prevent that help from being used when prayer fails to be answered in that case. \n \n Homosexuality isn't a case of physical disease which I am claiming needs to be healed spiritually rather than cured medically. It is a spiritual sin of the flesh like any number of sins that afflict straights also. They are all covered by the blood of Christ and their healings are one of the natural results of salvation. What I have been trying to explain to the militant gays around here is that in order to take hold of the grace that Jesus promised, they must do what any straight sinner does in getting saved, and that is to repent, and then turn away from their predominant sin of homosexuality. Then comes deliverance. Just as a straight adulterer or fornicator who gets saved must denounce and turn away from his predominant sins when he accept Christ as his Savior. \n \n It's the same process for both. And with both, spiritual deliverance from those fleshly sins are the result. But repentance is key to receiving Gods salvation. Only gays seek a special dispensation that say's that homosexuality is right and normal and doesn't need to be repented of. That is the great stumbling block that prevents their full acceptance of the salvation process. See the difference? One is physical healing and the other is spiritual deliverance as a result of salvation.",

And it is the exact correct way to get accurate statistics based on population size of the different groups being analyzed. You just amaze me at how totally dishonest you are as you obfuscate facts that you don't want to consider.\n \n\n Look, Archie boy, if you want to purposely make a spectacle of the stupidity of your argument, I certainly won't stop you. I know how to do statistical analysis. I'm obfuscating nothing; the statistical analysis is irrelevant for the purposes of supporting your argument. Let's recap:\n You said that homosexuality is deadly and destructive.\n You were asked how homosexuality can be considered these things.\n You responded by referring to AIDS. That is, your clear intent was to argue that homosexuality is deadly and/or destructive at least in part because of AIDS. As this was the only reason you gave, we're addressing it solely.\n Here's the beef: In order for homosexuality to be the deadly and destructive part, you must show that only homosexuals die or are \"destructed\" by AIDS. If it is not only the homosexuals who are negatively afflicted by AIDS, then it is not the homosexuality that is deadly and destructive, at least due to your given reason.\n The fact is that AIDS does not discriminate. You may want to jump up and down and scream that every heterosexual who has ever acquired HIV is really a closet bisexual experimenter, and you're entitled to your dumbass opinions. Rest assured that they will be exposed for what they are.\n \n \nIt is you attempting to change the subject so you don't have to face reality and answer my question.\n\n Actually, I'm the one bringing you back to your assertion. You are the one changing the subject to statistical frequencies.\n Glad to see your projection is still working full-tilt.\n \n \nAnd where's the WHOs link you promised that proves your numbers that more straights have died in America from AIDS than Gays have?\n\n I didn't promise anything. I know that you think that pandion is a forum clone of mine, but you also think that of about half of the Western world.\n The thing is, I don't think pandion promised anything either. But instead of apologizing for attacking me for failing to keep a promise that I didn't make, how about you just answer these questions:\n 1) Do you deny that a statistically significant number of heterosexuals carry or have died from HIV/AIDS?\n 2) If it is true that more heterosexuals than homosexuals have died from HIV/AIDS, will you acknowledge that your \"AIDS makes homosexuality deadly and destructive\" argument is refuted?\n \n \nYet here you are completely ignoring that reality as you attempt to make AIDS sound like it originally started as a universal disease in both the straight and gay communities.\n\n When did I even imply this? Go ahead. Show me.\n You can't. If you were left with the impression that that was my belief or that I wanted readers to come to that understanding, you have only your reading incomprehension to blame. You can take your pompous projection and stick it where the sun doesn't shine.\n \n \nOnly you self deluded gay apologists and liars could try to completely rewrite history and convince anyone that in 1980, when gay men were dropping like fly's between San Fran and New York City...\n\n Last time I checked, it was 2008. You could be completely self-deluded and keep yourself stuck in the past, but the rest of the world has embraced the passage of time enough to use calendars.\n \n \nSo don't even try to lie to me in your usual sanctimonious style of insulting your way to being right.\n\n But I never lied to you. Nothing I said was inaccurate, and nothing I said was even remotely misleading. If you felt insulted by my pointing out the idiocy of your argument, then it's your fault for making an idiotic argument.\n \n \nThis disease may be in both communities today, but it wasn't when it started out.\n\n Is this an admission that lifelong heterosexuals who don't share needles and don't experiment sexually with the same sex acquire HIV and AIDS?\n \n \nAIDS was born in the gay community and only in the gay community.\n\n AIDS was in the \"lower\" primate community before it was in the human community. I suppose that makes being a monkey \"deadly and destructive\"? It was likely transmitted to humans by eating an infected simian. Does that make eating game \"deadly and destructive\"?\n \n \nChallenge all you want to.\n\n I do. You ignore it. Par for the course.\n \n \nBut you'll make no points with me, nor will I ever change my assertion that homosexuality is deadly and destructive to its practitioners.\n\n Nor will you ever support your assertion that homosexuality is deadly and destructive to its practitioners. emoticon_rolleyes",

Wouldn't that fact be obvious to intellectuals such as yourselves? But would you please prove that more straights have died from AIDS than Gays as a percentage of their respective communities? I would love to see that statistic.\n\n \n This is where you squirmed http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=314021&postcount=26 and tried to wriggle your way out of being proven wrong with this complete obfuscation of the facts, by denying that statistical breakdown based on population size is the only right way to determine if more straights PER CAPITA have died from AIDS than gays have as Pandion claimed was a WHO statistic here: http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=313959&postcount=20 This alleged statistic still hasn't been supplied yet.\n \n Then you, while twisting everything I believe about homosexuality and the transfer of of AIDS insisted that it is both a straight and gay disease which has nothing to do with its origins, which was specifically localized within the gay community exclusively. AIDS was never a straight disease until it transfered into it through infected carriers who were obviously bisexuals of unknown origins. http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=314021&postcount=26\n \n My post explains the historically accurate origins of AIDS which are undeniable and aren't founded in any way within the straight community anywhere. It was a known and accepted gay disease which is why gay bath houses and sex clubs were forcibly closed for years until legislation can create controllable oversight for them. http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=314024&postcount=27\n \n And then comes you post which again attempts to make fallacious excuses and redefine the debate once again so you don't look so stupid.

   "Which iangb, you and Pandion pounced on en-masse as if AIDS is a straight disease that has killed more straights than gays in America.\n\n \"As if AIDS is a straight disease\"? You must border on functional illiteracy. I responded as if AIDS afflicts people regardless of their sexual orientation.\n \n \nTHAT YOU MOCKINGLY AGREED EXIST HERE:\n\n No, I didn't agree. I suspect they do, but I'm not going on a wild goose chase for something that is irrelevant.\n \n \n... you squirmed and tried to wriggle your way out of being proven wrong with this complete obfuscation of the facts, by denying that statistical breakdown based on population size is the only right way to determine if more straights PER CAPITA have died from AIDS than gays have as Pandion claimed was a WHO statistic\n\n I never denied that an accurate representation of frequency of AIDS would include statistics of background sexual orientation. You're simply lying, or else you're functionally illiterate because you can't understand my simple words.\n \n \nThen you, while twisting everything I believe about homosexuality and the transfer of of AIDS...\n\n And how, pray tell, did I do that?\n \n \n... insisted that it is both a straight and gay disease...\n\n Which it is.\n \n \n... which has nothing to do with its origins...\n\n Damn right.\n \n \n... which was specifically localized within the gay community exclusively.\n\n Irrelevant but still wrong. As I already told you, HIV existed in non-humans first. We don't know exactly where and when the interspecies jump occurred, but there's no evidence linking the first known case to homosexuality.\n \n \nAIDS was never a straight disease until it transfered into it through infected carriers who were obviously bisexuals of unknown origins.\n\n Oh look, a claim with no evidence.\n \n \nMy post explains the historically accurate origins of AIDS which are undeniable and aren't founded in any way within the straight community anywhere.\n\n No it doesn't. Your post doesn't say anything about the SIV. It doesn't say anything about the first case of HIV. Even had your post contained any information that was actually true, you haven't supplied links to that effect. If you get to bitch and moan that pandion hasn't yet given a WHO link, why do you think you get to spout this balderdash without providing links of your own?\n \n \nAnd then comes you post which again attempts to make fallacious excuses and redefine the debate once again so you don't look so stupid.\n\n \"Redefine\"? No, I recapped. You made claims that homosexuality is deadly and destructive. Only after being repeatedly pressed in multiple threads did you offer a passing explanation for this assertion: AIDS. You proceeded to see your argument ripped to shreds because it's just incredibly stupid.\n \n \nAnd here is all the evidence I need to post as evidence of that fact. http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=314069&postcount=30\n\n And here is the same link, which is all the evidence I need to show that you've completely evaded my points because you simply have no substantive defense of your idiotic argument.

   "All you have demonstrated, Archangel, is that promiscuity is dangerous and destructive, you have proven nothing about homosexuality. Show me how a faithful, monogamous gay couple will suffer from this supposed danger and destruction? For example: revds. David Lord and Peter Cowell.\n\n \n All you have demonstrated Jo, regarding the bolded, is that stating the obvious is the best we'll ever get from you. And as for the rest of your post, that you can deny the reality of what someone say's with the best of them. lyte/pandion/penfold/etc... \n \n What I have recapped for you is that the AIDS disease exists in the USA due to , and exclusively because it was born and grew unchecked within the bath houses and sex clubs which were sexual popular playgrounds for random sex back then, just as they are today within the gay community. And they are still hot spots for the transfer of STDs of all types, right up to and including the transfer of HIV. And it is well known that straight married men frequent these places too which is why these diseases get into the straight community via the women who then have sex with these men and then have more random sex with other men.\n \n This is why sexual promiscuity is a National Social epidemic that effects all of us. Have you ever heard the saying that when you have sex with someone, you have sex with everyone they ever had sex with? Or the other one that say's that having sex with one random lover today is equal to having sex with as many as 5000 other people? \n \n Now getting back to this distractingly inaccurate link you're all making about my statement that homosexuality is both self destructive and damaging to its practitioners; I was referring to it being spiritually destructive to their soul. I wasn't implying that they are necessarily disease magnets. My problem here is that I make a specific point in one debate and you guys then take that specific statement that was meant for one debate and apply it as my blanket opinion for every debate no matter what the subject being discussed.",

   "http://www.redcross.org/services/hss/tips/gaydisease.html \nQuestion: Isn't AIDS a gay disease? \n \n Basic Answer: No. AIDS (a result of HIV infection) is caused by a virus (HIV). Anyone can get HIV through blood-to-blood or sexual contact with a person with HIV. Like anyone else, men who have sex with men are at risk if they have contact with an HIV-positive person's blood, semen, vaginal fluid or breast milk. \n \n Detailed Answer: No. AIDS (a result of HIV infection) is caused by HIV, a virus that can infect people regardless of sexual orientation. HIV can infect anyone who has sexual or blood-to-blood contact with an HIV-positive person. The virus can infect men, women and children. Men who have sex with men or women and women who have sex with men or women are at risk if their partners have HIV infection. Correct and consistent use of latex (or polyurethane if allergic to latex) condoms, however, greatly reduces the risk of transmission. Risk relates to what people do, not who they are.\n \n In many countries, the numbers of women with HIV are nearly equal to the numbers of infected men, and the number of women with HIV/AIDS continues to steadily increase worldwide. As of July 2002, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated that about 18 million women were living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, accounting for 47 percent of the 37.2 million adults living with HIV/AIDS. In many countries, HIV spreads mostly through sex between men and women. And in the United States, the number of people with HIV/AIDS who became infected through sex between men and women continues to grow.\n",

Tey may or may not be valid, but the \"very\" is superfluous.\n \n http://aras.ab.ca/articles/popular/200706-RobertR.html\n\n \n Thanks for posting the link, it's some interesting reading. But it disproves nothing that I said conclusively at all. It is chock full of what ifs and may be's. Here is one very interesting paragraph that deals with some of my concerns.\n Even if we accept the notion that Robert is the first documented American case of HIV/AIDS, there are still problems with the story of his illness and death. For starters, all known viruses spread only from one human body to another; they are not airborne as bacteria and other infectants are. By now, most of us are aware of what the vectors of HIV are believed to be: blood transfusions, intravenous drug use and unprotected sex. Robert claimed never to have received a transfusion or to have used IV drugs, and the doctors could not find evidence of either. As far as anyone knew, he&#8217;d never traveled out of the St. Louis region, much less the United States. He claimed to have had sex just once, &#8220;with a neighborhood girl,&#8221; and that he started to feel sick shortly after that encounter. The doctors, like most at that time, did not think to ask about homosexual contact, and he refused to submit to a rectal scan. (The lesions were found only during his autopsy.) When his case was re-examined during the mid-1980&#8217;s, the disease had very few American victims who hadn&#8217;t received blood transfusions or weren&#8217;t IV drug users or gay men in a few cities. So, naturally, the doctors decided that if he hadn&#8217;t used drugs or had a transfusion, gay sex was most likely the cause.\n My question is, why would a kid as sick as Robert refuse a rectal scan, or any scan the doctors sought to perform on him in the hope of discovering both a cause and subsequently, a cure?\n \n If anything, this paragraph alone confirms that my recollections of the time were spot on. No tests were known at the time to give to blood donors, so this disease was spread into the general population 3 main ways that have been documented. (1) Blood Transfusions, (2) IV Drug Users, and (3) Gay Sex. And the only reason the medical authorities even focussed in on Gays was because most all of the victims of the early 80s when questioned, all admitted to being gay and having unprotected sex with men in gay bath houses and sex clubs. \n \n As for the rest who didn't fit that criteria and weren't gay, they either had blood transfusions or were admitted IV drug users who shared needles. This discovery led to testing donors blood, and starting needle programs. But sadly, the genie was already out of the bottle and HIV/AIDS was already out there and in the general population only to be spread indiscriminately through promiscuous and random sex that has become such normal part of the America's morals and values system. Here is another excerpt from the article and the final paragraph sums it up nicely I think. But I'm also quoting what I'm reading for the first time, but is the whole assertion that the US Government is responsible for infecting the black community with AIDS. This article documents the origins of that claim in the underlined section.\n One more point about Robert&#8217;s illnesses: KS has been found in African children as young as three years old. If we accept that KS afflicts people with compromised immune systems, it would seem that a three-year-old who gets sick with it either was born with few or no defenses or loses them in his infancy due to environmental factors. In one of his rare communicative moments, he told the doctors his grandfather &#8220;had the same symptoms.&#8221; This might suggest a congenital immunodeficiency, and that HIV, HHV8 and Chlamydia had exacerbated this problem rather than caused his illnesses. If this is so, one would have to question the notion that HIV breaks down the immune system and leaves the body vulnerable to AIDS.\n \n Robert&#8217;s case also begs the question as to how he developed KS lesions in his anus and rectum, when lesions in those parts of the body had not been seen in American or European KS patients up to that time. While the notion that anal sex spreads HIV (and the notion that HIV causes AIDS) has not been questioned by most researchers in the quarter of a century since the discovery of the virus, no one has found any evidence that anal sex directly causes KS lesions. So even if Robert were lying about his sexual history, there is little to suggest that he contracted anal and rectal KS lesions, let alone HIV, from gay sex. Instead, there is evidence that anal lesions are the end-result of an internal gastro-intestinal infestation: in other words, the lesions develop from the inside outward. One possible initiator of such a trajectory is a genetic predisposition to autoimmune diseases, as well as other environmental factors. If his grandfather indeed &#8220;had the same symptoms,&#8221; as Robert claimed, this, along with the fact that the only known juvenile cases of KS had been found in African boys, the notion that KS could result from inborn conditions has at least some credence.\n \n Yet another theory describe in the book &#8220;The River&#8221; says that Robert became vulnerable to the illnesses he contracted because of an incident that should cause anyone who knows about it to distrust governments. During the 1950&#8217;s, the Army Chemical Corps conducted open-air chemical warfare tests in American cities. These included thirty-five aerosol releases in and around St. Louis. Most of those tests were conducted in low-income neighborhoods full of people of color, probably to minimize public resistance to such tests. One of those test areas was only half a block from the house in which Robert was born.\n \n At the time, the Army and the CIA (who worked with the Army on some of the projects) gave a cover story to local officials and the press in which they claimed that they were conducting the experiments to see whether smoke screens could shield US cities from Soviet attack. More than two decades later, an army spokesman insisted the tests were &#8220;completely safe.&#8221;\n \n However, those tests involved zinc cadmium sulfide, a mixture of zinc sulfide and cadmium sulfide. It&#8217;s frequently referred to as a flourescent particle because it glows in ultraviolet light. This quality makes it easy to trace in diffusion experiments. However, cadmium is a highly toxic metal that is even more pernicious when spread through the air. Because the kidneys absorb it quickly, it is commonly associated with kidney failure, leads to cirrhosis of the liver and causes severe damage to the lungs and edemae. All of these were noted in Robert&#8217;s report. Also, the effects can be passed by the mother to her fetus, so it&#8217;s entirely possible that Robert may have developed the seeds of his illnesses while he was still in the womb.So what, exactly, made Robert sick? We may some day have the answer, but not as long as a postmortem diagnosis made with the limited knowledge the scientific community had about a disease, its etiology and epidemology is allowed to stand in the light of evidence to contradict it, and as long as that analysis is still accepted as part of a foundation for research and other work related to AIDS. Poor Robert R., who surely suffered in life, has been used in death as a foundation for one of the more crippling myths in our history. He and the fourteen friends and acquaintances of mine whose deaths were attributed to AIDS are surely spinning in their graves.",

And they are still hot spots for the transfer of STDs of all types, right up to and including the transfer of HIV. And it is well known that straight married men frequent these places too which is why these diseases get into the straight community via the women who then have sex with these men and then have more random sex with other men.\n \n This is why sexual promiscuity is a National Social epidemic that effects all of us. Have you ever heard the saying that when you have sex with someone, you have sex with everyone they ever had sex with? Or the other one that say's that having sex with one random lover today is equal to having sex with as many as 5000 other people? \n \n Now getting back to this distractingly inaccurate link you're all making about my statement that homosexuality is both self destructive and damaging to its practitioners; I was referring to it being spiritually destructive to their soul. I wasn't implying that they are necessarily disease magnets. My problem here is that I make a specific point in one debate and you guys then take that specific statement that was meant for one debate and apply it as my blanket opinion for every debate no matter what the subject being discussed.\n\n \n \n So your saying that AIDS originated in bath houses from sexual activity?wrong. It was discovered due to drug users blood transfusions and other small cases. Only first as a group was AIDS discovered in gays, then later heterosexuals. Did you also know that heterosexuals actually have more of a percentage of AIDS than gays? \n \n Also what about safe sex? What about condom usage?

I DO CONDEMN THE SINS OF THE FLESH THAT THEY COMMIT AND WILL WARN THEM OF THEIR REBELLION AGAINST GOD.\n \n Homosexuality is a sin of the flesh and I do decry it as that which leads to the destruction of its practitioners. Remember? I have said this before? But since you seem incapable of comprehending the very direct answer which I reposted below, I see no reason to try to clarify any more than I have above. Other than to say that I personally love all gay people. I neither hate or condemn them in any way. But just as I am a sinner who was in need of salvation and deliverance from the fleshly sins that held me in bondage, so do the practitioners of homosexuality need that same deliverance that comes only through Jesus.\n \n \nThank you for asking this question as it absolutely highlights your own hatred and continued bigotry towards me even after I have repeatedly said that it is homosexuality that is condemned by GOD, \"not\" the homosexual who is beyond redemption in any way.\n \n So to answer your question directly, I DON'T CONDEMN HOMOSEXUALS FOR HAVING SAME GENDER SEX AT ALL, JUST AS I DON'T CONDEMN STRAIGHT ADULTERERS AND FORNICATORS FOR THEIR SINS OF THE FLESH. I DO CONDEMN THE SINS OF THE FLESH THAT THEY COMMIT AND WILL WARN THEM OF THEIR REBELLION AGAINST GOD. BUT TO IMPLY THAT I CONDEMN THEM, OR ANYONE WOULD BE TO FIRST IMPLY THAT THEY ARE BEYOND REDEMPTION, OR SAVING, AND THAT JUST WOULDN'T BE TRUE. \n \n AND SECONDLY IT IMPLIES THAT I HAVE THE POWER TO CONDEMN ANYONE TO HELL WHICH NO MAN HAS THE POWER TO DO. SO NO LYTEBOY, I CONDEMN NOBODY AT ALL FOR ANY SIN THEY COMMIT AGAINST THEMSELVES OR GOD. THE BIBLE SAY'S TO HATE THE SIN BUT LOVE THE SINNER. ONE DAY, ALL OF YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT THE ONE PERSON YOU ATTACKED MOST FERVENTLY AND WITH THE MOST CONDEMNATION HERE, WAS THE ONE PERSON WHO WAS TELLING YOU THE WHOLE TRUTH, WITHOUT COMPROMISE OR PERSONAL GAIN IN MIND AT ALL, AND THEREFORE LOVING YOU AS GOD COMMANDS US TO DO.\n \n Now what tack will you take to demonize and slander me NEXT? I can't wait to see to what level of degradation you will go to next in your attempts to defame me. emoticon_xgood\n",

   "So your saying that AIDS originated in bath houses from sexual activity?wrong. It was discovered due to drug users blood transfusions and other small cases.

Where is your evidence that this \"cultural practice\" among gay people existed? \n\n \n AIDS was never tracked back to the felon and indigent sector of society so attempting to add them into the equation is fallacious. I haven't, nor would I deny that some IV users may have sold tainted blood before testing was done. But if they were the largest contributers then the trail would have led back to that segments of society. But it didn't, it led back to the gay community. That is undeniable historical fact that your link confirms. \n \n \nMy information regarding the diagnosis of the unfortunate \"Robert\" competely undercuts your other assertion regarding the genesis of AIDS in San Francisco bathhouses. He never went there, he had no record of gay activity, and he died ten years before your imagined genesis.\n\n \n Sorry Penfold, but it doesn't accomplish that at all. He is one VERY QUESTIONABLE, UNVERIFIED CASE THAT THE EXPERTS CAN'T CONFIRM EITHER WAY, WHICH I QUOTED IN MY POST. But I'm not even claiming Robert was gay. I'm just reposting what your link say's.\n So what, exactly, made Robert sick? We may some day have the answer, but not as long as a postmortem diagnosis made with the limited knowledge the scientific community had about a disease, its etiology and epidemology is allowed to stand in the light of evidence to contradict it, and as long as that analysis is still accepted as part of a foundation for research and other work related to AIDS. Poor Robert R., who surely suffered in life, has been used in death as a foundation for one of the more crippling myths in our history. He and the fourteen friends and acquaintances of mine whose deaths were attributed to AIDS are surely spinning in their graves.",

OMG AIDS! AAAIIIIDS!!!\"\n\n \n Again you show nothing but denial and ignorance regarding anything I have actually said. Every single response you offer is nothing more than a reflection of your own hatred and bigotry against anything I say. Here is the evidence you asked for, although I posted plenty of it from Penfolds link that stated as a matter of fact that what happened in the early 80s was an AIDS epidemic in the gay community. But only in your small mind could that equate to me screaming AIDS! OMG AAAIIIDS!!! \n 1981 History\n \n Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) was a rare form of relatively benign cancer that tended to occur in older people. But by March 1981 at least eight cases of a more aggressive form of KS had occurred amongst young gay men in New York.2\n \n At about the same time there was an increase, in both California and New York, in the number of cases of a rare lung infection Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP)3. In April this increase in PCP was noticed at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta. A drug technician, Sandra Ford, noticed a high number of requests for the drug pentamine, used in the treatment of PCP:\n \n \"A doctor was treating a gay man in his 20s who had pneumonia. Two weeks later, he called to ask for a refill of a rare drug that I handled. This was unusual - nobody ever asked for a refill. Patients usually were cured in one 10-day treatment or they died\" - Sandra Ford for Newsweek 4\n \n \"Dr. Curran said there was no apparent danger to non homosexuals from contagion. 'The best evidence against contagion', he said, 'is that no cases have been reported to date outside the homosexual community or in women'\" - The New York Times 11\n Just five months later, in December 1981, it was clear that the disease affected other population groups, when the first cases of PCP were reported in injecting drug users.\n \n 1982 History\n \n The disease still did not have a name, with different groups referring to it in different ways. The CDC generally referred to it by reference to the diseases that were occurring, for example lymphadenopathy (swollen glands), although on some occasions they referred to it as KSOI, the name already given to the CDC task force.14 15\n \n In contrast some still linked the disease to its initial occurrence in gay men, with a letter in The Lancet calling it \"gay compromise syndrome\".16 Others called it GRID (gay-related immune deficiency), AID (acquired immunodeficiency disease), \"gay cancer\" or \"community-acquired immune dysfunction\".17 18\n \n In June a report of a group of cases amongst gay men in Southern California suggested that the disease might be caused by an infectious agent that was sexually transmitted.19\n \n By the beginning of July a total of 452 cases, from 23 states, had been reported to the CDC. \n http://www.avert.org/his81_86.htm\n \n \nYou don't even deny that AIDS is not a disease that afflicts only gays.\n\n \n Of course I don't. That would be irrational because AIDS is transfered through the transfer of bodily fluids and blood. It requires intimate contact which is why it is commonly, but not exclusively contracted through sexual contact. But as long as one man is free to have sex with his wife or girlfriend, and then go trolling in gay bars for sexual thrills on weekends, then AIDS will continue to cross over due to such irresponsible sexual promiscuity that can occur in any number of directions between sexual preferences and genders.\n \n Consider this scenario, 1 in 4 New Yorkers have genital herpes, a full 19% of Americans in general have it, that's 1 in 5 approximately; with 50% of blacks having it. Imagine these sores rupturing during sex and causing the transfer of blood that way from one person to the other. I'm crazy right? Just an alarmist? Here's the link and the warning. http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/11/2270734.htm1 in 4 New Yorkers have genital herpes virus\n \n Posted Wed Jun 11, 2008 6:00am AEST\n \n One in four adults living in New York City has the virus that causes genital herpes, and among African-Americans the rate is almost 50 per cent, official statistics show.\n \n The sexually transmitted herpes simplex virus Type 2 is more prevalent in New York City, at 26 per cent, than nationally, where 19 per cent of adults, roughly one in five, are infected.\n \n Far more women than men have the virus, 36 per cent compared to 19, in the city mythologised in the television-turned-movie megahit Sex in the City.\n \n The study by New York City Department of Health also reveals that herpes is far more common among African-Americans - 49 percent - than whites (14 per cent).\n \n Most people infected with HSV-2 present no symptoms, but those that do experience periodic outbreaks of painful genital sores that heal in two to four weeks.\n \n \"Genital herpes alone will not cause serious problems for most people,\" said Julia Schillinger, director of surveillance for the Health Department's Bureau of Sexually Transmitted Disease Prevention and Control.\n \n \"But some people will have painful genital sores, and the infection fosters the spread of HIV,\" she said, urging New Yorkers to protect themselves and others.\n \n \"Using condoms consistently will help you avoid getting or spreading genital herpes,\" she said.",

   "emoticon_confused It wont??? Have you ever heard of AIDS?\n\n \n No, it won't. To suggest otherwise is absurd. \n \n Let's take a quiz. \n \n 1.) If Brian (an 18 y/o homosexual virgin) has his first sexual contact with Carl (another 18 y/o homosexual virgin) and they remain lifelong monogamous partners...what is their risk of contracting HIV through sexual contact?\n \n A.) 5%\n B.) 27%\n C.) 100%\n D.) 0%\n E.) No way to tell\n \n The answer obviously is D. 0%. \n \n Thus proving that homosexuality does not lead to HIV/AIDS.\n \n It is known by those with a little education on the subject, that HIV is spread through risky sexual behavior. This applies to both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Many exclusively heterosexual people have contracted HIV and died from AIDS. \n \n 2.) If Jake (an HIV infected heterosexual male) has unprotected insertive anal sex with Heather (an uninfected heterosexual female) and Brian (an uninfected homosexual male) has unprotected insertive anal sex with Carl (an infected homosexual male), the person with the greatest statistical chance of aquiring HIV is:\n \n A.) Heather\n B.) Brian\n C.) Equal chance\n D.) No way to tell\n \n Statistically, Heather has the greatest chance of infection. \n \n Thus again showing that sexual orientation has no bearing on probability of infection...it leads back to (suprise suprise) behavior. Being the receptive partner (as Heather is in our hypothetical) makes one far more likely to be infected. Insertive partners are statistically less likely to aquire HIV through contact with an infected partner (both vaginal and anal intercourse). \n \n I don't expect AA to understand or even agree with any of this...but maybe a few others will get it. HIV is blind to sexual orientation. Homosexual men who engage in monogamous relationships with uninfected partners are no more at risk of HIV infection than are heterosexuals who do the same. It is all about behavior. \n \n But then again...AA has proven his ignorance before on the subject of HIV when asked this question:\n \n \nArchie,\n \n Simple question for you.\n I'm in a monogamous relationship. Both of us STD free.\n What are our chances of dying from AIDS?\n\n \n AA's response:\n \n \nIf what you say is true, your chances of dying from AIDS is still possible because of the potential from mixing of types of bodily fluids and materials that were never intended to be passed between two men. Gay sex is an assault on your immune system even if you truly kept it between the same two men in my opinion. Also, if what you say is true, then you are neither representative of the norm within the homosexual community, nor are you representative of the norm for homosexual couples who statistically swap partners and have random sex even when in so called exclusive relationships. So your point is nice on a personal level but it has no place in reality.\n\n \n This should give everyone a good look at AA's acumen in respect to HIV/AIDS. \n \n And a quick note AA, if you take the time to read this. I do not wish to debate you on the subject of HIV/AIDS at all. A properly constructed debate consists of 2 or more people who are adequately educated on a particular subject. In the case of HIV/AIDS, you have shown a willful ingorance of knowledge. It would be impossible to have an intelligent debate with someone who argues that HIV can spontaneously generate by the \"mixing of body fluids and materials that were never intended to be passed between two men\".",

   "Neither do I wish to debate this issue with someone with such a limited perspective on the facts as to be in denial of them, snakespit. But here is another perspective that explains that monogamy to gays is very different than it is to straights which completely nullifies your hypothetical, as I have explained before to the very loud rebuke of the gays here. Not denials that this material is accurate of course, just rebukes and off topic attacks for accurately defining the obvious promiscuity within the gay community, described here: http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/homosexuality/ho0075.html#06 . But don't bother confusing the issue with facts as that wouldn't serve your delusions at all.\n E. \"Monogamy\"\n \n Monogamy for heterosexual couples means at a minimum sexual fidelity. The most extensive survey of sex in America found that \"a vast majority [of heterosexual married couples] are faithful while the marriage is intact.\"99 The survey further found that 94 percent of married people and 75 percent of cohabiting people had only one partner in the prior year.100 In contrast, long-term sexual fidelity is rare among GLB couples, particularly among gay males. Even during the coupling period, many gay men do not expect monogamy. A lesbian critic of gay males notes that:\n \n \"After a period of optimism about the longrange potential of gay men's one-on-one relationships, gay magazines are starting to acknowledge the more relaxed standards operating here, with recent articles celebrating the bigger bang of sex with strangers or proposing 'monogamy without fidelity'-the latest Orwellian formulation to excuse having your cake and eating it too.\"101\n Gay men's sexual practices appear to be consistent with the concept of \"monogamy without fidelity.\" Astudy of gay men attending circuit parties showed that 46 percent were coupled, that is, they claimed to have a \"primary partner.\" Twenty-seven percent of the men with primary partners \"had multiple sex partners (oral or anal) during their most recent circuit party weekend . . . .\"102 For gay men, sex outside the primary relationship is ubiquitous even during the first year. Gay men reportedly have sex with someone other than their partner in 66 percent of relationships within the first year, rising to approximately 90 percent if the relationship endures over five years.103 And the average gay or lesbian relationship is short lived. In one study, only 15 percent of gay men and 17.3 percent of lesbians had relationships that lasted more than three years.104 Thus, the studies reflect very little long-term monogamy in GLB relationships.\n http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/homosexuality/ho0075.html\n \n As these stats show, monogamy to gays has nothing at all in common with the true definition of the word monogamy. So what these stats show pretty conclusively, is that if 2 gay men are in a so called exclusively monogamous relationship, the best one could hope for is that only one of those men are actually exclusive to that relationship. The other guy is having sex with strangers/someone outside of their relationship. So the presumption of protection against STDs by the faithful partner is an illusion at best. Sorry to burst your bubble and bring you back to reality, but in case you are completely unaware of it, homosexuality is a very promiscuous lifestyle.",

All anyone need do is click on the link and read what it say's. It's speaking to monogamy in the gay community as is shown here from the article below: [\"After a period of optimism about the longrange potential of gay men's one-on-one relationships, gay magazines are starting to acknowledge the more relaxed standards operating here, with recent articles celebrating the bigger bang of sex with strangers or proposing 'monogamy without fidelity'-the latest Orwellian formulation to excuse having your cake and eating it too\".]\n \n \n \nNeither do I wish to debate this issue with someone with such a limited perspective on the facts as to be in denial of them, snakespit. But here is another perspective that explains that monogamy to gays is very different than it is to straights which completely nullifies your hypothetical, as I have explained before to the very loud rebuke of the gays here. Not denials that this material is accurate of course, just rebukes and off topic attacks for accurately defining the obvious promiscuity within the gay community, described here: http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/homosexuality/ho0075.html#06 . But don't bother confusing the issue with facts as that wouldn't serve your delusions at all.\n E. \"Monogamy\"\n \n Monogamy for heterosexual couples means at a minimum sexual fidelity. The most extensive survey of sex in America found that \"a vast majority [of heterosexual married couples] are faithful while the marriage is intact.\"99 The survey further found that 94 percent of married people and 75 percent of cohabiting people had only one partner in the prior year.100 In contrast, long-term sexual fidelity is rare among GLB couples, particularly among gay males. Even during the coupling period, many gay men do not expect monogamy. A lesbian critic of gay males notes that:\n \n \"After a period of optimism about the longrange potential of gay men's one-on-one relationships, gay magazines are starting to acknowledge the more relaxed standards operating here, with recent articles celebrating the bigger bang of sex with strangers or proposing 'monogamy without fidelity'-the latest Orwellian formulation to excuse having your cake and eating it too.\"101\n Gay men's sexual practices appear to be consistent with the concept of \"monogamy without fidelity.\" Astudy of gay men attending circuit parties showed that 46 percent were coupled, that is, they claimed to have a \"primary partner.\" Twenty-seven percent of the men with primary partners \"had multiple sex partners (oral or anal) during their most recent circuit party weekend . . . .\"102 For gay men, sex outside the primary relationship is ubiquitous even during the first year. Gay men reportedly have sex with someone other than their partner in 66 percent of relationships within the first year, rising to approximately 90 percent if the relationship endures over five years.103 And the average gay or lesbian relationship is short lived. In one study, only 15 percent of gay men and 17.3 percent of lesbians had relationships that lasted more than three years.104 Thus, the studies reflect very little long-term monogamy in GLB relationships.\n http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/homosexuality/ho0075.html\n \n As these stats show, monogamy to gays has nothing at all in common with the true definition of the word monogamy. So what these stats show pretty conclusively, is that if 2 gay men are in a so called exclusively monogamous relationship, the best one could hope for is that only one of those men are actually exclusive to that relationship. The other guy is having sex with strangers/someone outside of their relationship. So the presumption of protection against STDs by the faithful partner is an illusion at best. Sorry to burst your bubble and bring you back to reality, but in case you are completely unaware of it, homosexuality is a very promiscuous lifestyle.\n",

   "Archie, repeating the argument that I've already answered will get you nowhere. I took the 'combinations of both types' into account, because i used it as my total figure from which to calculate my percentage. However, neither your or my conclusion is particularly relevant.\n \n To explain, I'll use an example, building on what I've already posted.\n \n Let's say I want to compare the number of left-handed scissors with the number of right-handed scissors. If I google 'scissors' then I get about 27,000,000 results (all results rounded to 2 significant figures). If I google \"left-handed scissors\" then I get about 35,000 results. If I use your technique and google \"right-handed scissors\" I get about 18,000 results.\n \n So, by your calculations (35000/(35000+18000)) = 0.66 = 66% of all scissors are 'left-handed'. Clearly the left-handed among us (<10% of the population) are hardcore scissor users!\n If you use my calculations, however, (35000/27000000) = 0.0013 = 0.13% of all scissors are left-handed. Clearly the left-handers almost never use scissors!\n \n Which of these answers are correct? The answer - neither. The real answer is somewhere between the two - your survey ignores the right-handed scissors that are not labelled 'right-handed' because it is generally assumed that scissors are right-handed, and my survey incorrectly includes all the articles about scissors that talk about them to mean 'use scissors to cut along the outline', or 'wikipedia: scissors'.\n \n In short, it was only an interesting experiment and neither my conclusion nor your conclusion is particularly valid. I was wrong to include it in my post - despite the 'interesting experiment' you took it too seriously. You were wrong in that you took it too seriously, and misunderstood my maths. Let's move on, shall we? My main point in that post was\n \nI think you've distorted [your source] enough yourself already, to justify your prejudice against gays as individuals based on their (according to your source) majority acts. If I was to do the same thing with this forum, I could 'prove' that you don't actually believe in YEC, because the majority of 4Forumers do not either. See the problem?\n",
