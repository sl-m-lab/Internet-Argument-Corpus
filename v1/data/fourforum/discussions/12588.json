The suit was filed at the US District Court for the Northern District of New York.\n \n \"After years of denying students like Ashley, her brother Charlie and others their right to form a GSA, Indian River is taking an important first step toward righting its wrongs,\" said Lambda Legal attorney Michael Kavey.\n \n \"Respecting students' freedom to stand up for themselves and each other is a key part of creating a safe learning environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth and their allies.\"\n \n The lawsuit said that Charlie Pratt was severely harassed throughout his time in the school district. Students attacked him relentlessly with anti-,gay and sexist slurs including names like \"faggot,\" \"sissy,\" \"queer,\" and \"fudgepacker,\" often in the presence of teachers who failed to intervene.\n \n Students also are alleged to have pushed Charlie into walls and lockers, threatened him, threw food and other objects at him, spat on him, and vandalized his locker with anti-gay slurs. Staff members at the high school joined the harassment by ridiculing Charlie with stereotypically effeminate gestures in front of other students, according to the suit.\n \n Then-principal James Kettrick - now the district's superintendent - refused to take appropriate action, and instead told Charlie and his parents, Bobbi and Todd Petranchuk, that Charlie should \"tone it down\" to avoid harassment, Lambda Legal said in a media statement at the time the lawsuit was filed.\n \n Lambda said that the principal refused Bobbi Petranchuk's request to train teachers to address anti-gay bullying, and he failed to change the school's written policies to match state anti-harassment laws covering sexual orientation. Left with no other options, Charlie's parents withdrew him from school for his own protection, the suit said.\n \n \"We hope the District's statement that it will finally allow the GSA signals an effort to fully address the discriminatory atmosphere at the schools,\" said Sudwiti Chanda, a partner in the New York offices of Kirkland. \"We will work with Ashley to ensure that the District follows through on its promise to promote tolerance and inclusiveness by providing support, and equal opportunity and treatment to the GSA.\"\n \n While the District's approval of a GSA addresses some aspects of the lawsuit, Lambda and Kirkland & Ellis said they will press forward with other claims, including claims for damages on behalf of both plaintiffs. The lawsuit seeks damages for Charlie for violations of the federal Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and Free Speech Clause, as well as for violations of Title IX, the Federal Equal Access Act, and New York state antidiscrimination laws.",
