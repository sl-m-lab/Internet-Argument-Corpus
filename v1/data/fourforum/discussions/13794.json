   "Since it got rather quiet (even after 183 views) after I posted this in response to another thread, I figured I'd make a whole new post. \n \n Just for the sheer enjoyment. \n \n Knowing that I have the truth on my side: \"Firearms provide effective self defense for those who are resonsible enough to use them, therefore are a reasonable means of providing it\", I am strengthened. Deep down inside, I know with absolute certainty, that my belief of \"the general citizenry is better served providing for their own self defense\", is justified.\n Knowing this with my heart, I have the ability to concede facts that I dislike and are counterproductive to my arguement. Since I know that firearms are an inanimate object and the user is the one that determines how they are used, I have no problem agreeing with points that are distateful to me. Yes, there are instances of abuse. Yes, there are those who exist that should not posess firearms. Yes, there are instances of people who should not have them getting them legally. \n I can concede these points because THEY ARE NOT PROOF THAT I AM WRONG, they are merely instances of things occurring that are distasteful and are the antithesis of my belief. Knowing the truth, I have the support of it. I can stop reiterating it, arguing for it, and blustering about it....and it remains the truth. It doesn't need me to remain the truth.\n \n However, take the anti-gun point of view. It is impossible to explain why guns are bad for human beings to posess for their own self defense......unless they have a metal disk called a \"badge\" whereupon it suddenly becomes good. It is impossible to explain why, since firearms are completely forbidden in Washington D.C., they have the highest firearms murder rate by population percentage in the entire country. It is impossible to explain why, if guns are bad, 99% of the mass shootings in the country happen where guns are forbidden to be posessed and not where everyone has one (gun shows, gun stores, gun ranges).\n When it is required to continue supporting the false belief that an object is inherently \"evil\" and that it suddenly becomes inherently \"good\" if you also posess a shiny metal disk, one is required to continuously pull XXXX out of one's @$$ to support it. An anti-gunner doesn't have the benefit of admitting they are wrong. They cannot afford to lose one single piece of the crumbling house they are building. One little breeze, and the house of cards comes tumbling down. This is why you hear so many crazy lines of logic. If fact A must be true, than it MUST be supported by fact B even though fact B is obviously wrong for the whole world to see. It is fear that keeps them going. FEAR of having to admit their misguided belief. Once thay have committed to walking down that road, it cannot be reversed. In order to reverse their direction, they must first admit their willing complicity in a lie.\n So, they are trodding an endless road with glazed over eyes. They can see the stupid reasoning and obvious lying that travelling on the anti-gun road requires, yet to reverse their course it would require something far greater: They'd have to supress their ego and shamefully admit not only their wrongness, but their previous complicity in supporting a lie.\n \n Much easier to continue supporting the lie NO MATTER WHAT LAND OF OBVIOUS IDIOCY AND MORONIC PROJECTION THE ROAD LEADS THEM TO. Deep down inside, they know it. After a period of time they have to commit. You can't willingly delude yourself while knowing you are doing so. So, since return from that path is impossible without admitting their willful deception, they take the willful deception just one step further in order to salve their own conscience: They force themselves to believe it. Much easier.\n \n This is why you cannot sway an anti-gunner. Not only would it require a humility that would astonish a normal person (imagine admitting to knowingly lying and spouting forth misguided information solely for the sake of your own ego without regard to the truth), it would also require one to admit brainwashing one's self in order to avoid that uncomfortable fact. No, if you believe the anti-gun hysteria, you have to have an ego that is forged in steel and the size of leviathan.\n \n Anything that reveals the man behind the curtain must be crushed at all costs. Note the anger that comes out whenever you stick to the real truth. ANYTHING that reveals the misguided road they are on MUST BE CRUSHED! AT ALL COSTS!\n \n \n They don't have the comfort that the truth affords us. The ability to concede one simple fact. Do so, and the walls of the lies they build, not to mention the walls of their own self deception, come crumbling down.\n \n You see, having deluded themselves into believing thier own propaganda, they make one critical mistake. They project. They believe that since they are on a road of lies and have brainwashed themselves, that we must have done the same except on another road. Since their road has led to a goofeyville they must defend at all costs, they believe that we must be on a similar road to our own goofeyville. Any little chink will be exploited in a grand hope that our walls will come crashing down. Oh the excitement they must have! This tidbit could be the straw that breaks the gun-nut's back! This will shatter their world first! Imagine the anger they feel when they heap tidbit after tidbit on our argument and it remains standing. They cannot see that the truth has no need for us to build it. They think we react for the same reasons they do. To protect our illusions. \n \n It's not illusions we are defending. This is why anti-gunners fear even the most tiny nugget and must refute it. They think we need to do the same.",
