You're a dolt, and a sheep.\n \n For your edification, since you are a resounding idiot. Slavery was central to what caused the Civil War.\n \n Lincoln raised the issue of slavery again in 1858 when he made a speech at Quincy, Illinois. Lincoln commented: \"We have in this nation the element of domestic slavery. The Republican Party think it wrong - we think it is a moral, a social, and a political wrong. We think it is wrong not confining itself merely to the persons of the States where it exists, but that it is a wrong which in its tendency, to say the least, affects the existence of the whole nation. Because we think it wrong, we propose a course of policy that shall deal with it as a wrong. We deal with it as with any other wrong, insofar as we can prevent it growing any larger, and so deal with it that in the run of time there may be some promise of an end to it.\"\n \n Lincoln's speech upset Southern slaveowners and poor whites, who valued the higher social status they enjoyed over slaves. However, with rapid European immigration taking place in the North, they knew they had a declining influence over federal government. Their concern turned into outrage when in 1860 the Republican Party nominated Lincoln as its presidential candidate. Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, a Radical Republican, was selected as his running mate.\n \n The Democratic Party that met in Charleston in April, 1860, were deeply divided. Stephen A. Douglas was the choice of most northern Democrats but was opposed by those in the Deep South. When Douglas won the nomination, Southern delegates decided to hold another convention in Baltimore and in June selected John Beckenridge of Kentucky as their candidate. The situation was further complicated by the formation of the Constitutional Union Party and the nomination of John Bell of Tennessee as its presidential candidate.\n \n Lincoln won the presidential election with with 1,866,462 votes (18 free states) and beat Stephen A. Douglas (1,375,157 - 1 slave state), John Beckenridge (847,953 - 13 slave states) and John Bell (589,581 - 3 slave states).\n \n Lincoln selected his Cabinet carefully as he knew he would need a united government to face the serious problems ahead. His team included William Seward (Secretary of State), Salmon Chase (Secretary of the Treasury), Simon Cameron (Secretary of War), Gideon Welles (Secretary of the Navy), Edward Bates (Attorney General), Caleb Smith (Secretary of the Interior) and Montgomery Blair (Postmaster General).\n \n During his first administration he made only five changes to his Cabinet: Edwin M. Stanton (Secretary of War - 1862), John Usher (Secretary of the Interior - 1863), William Fessenden (Secretary of the Treasury - 1864), James Speed (Attorney General - 1864), William Dennison (Postmaster General - 1864), Henry McCulloch (Secretary of the Treasury - 1865) and James Harlan (Secretary of the Interior - 1865).\n \n In the three months that followed the election of Lincoln, seven states seceded from the Union: South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas. Representatives from these seven states quickly established a new political organization, the Confederate States of America.\n \n On 8th February the Confederate States of America adopted a constitution and within ten days had elected Jefferson Davis as its president and Alexander Stephens, as vice-president. Montgomery, Alabama, became its capital and the Stars and Bars was adopted as its flag. Davis was also authorized to raise 100,000 troops.",

If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.

   "China is doing an excellent job, diplomatically speaking, of posing as a 'soft power'. They are making new friends by basically saying 'hey, we're the new superpower, we're the good guys, we don't want to harm you or intrude on your sovereignty'. Incidentally, they are helping prop up regimes in anywhere from Sudan (think Darfur) to Iran and Cambodia. All of which have a terrifying human rights record.\n \n China is also doing a good job of covering up its domestic evils, as well. For instance, China has the most jailed journalists of any country in the world. China is not particularly friendly to those who are religious, much less to 'ultra'-reformists.\n \n They also havn't taken much heat for pretty much stalemating the North Korea talks. China is a powerbroker in the situation and they don't want to 'get tough' on North Korea.\n \n China isn't earning a good reputation because they deserve it, but because the world despises our inept policymakers. I think that China's good relations with the world (and our poor relations) will only be short-term. That is if we can find a president in '08, such as McCain, who will restore our dignity in the world. The problem isn't so much the war on terror so much as it is that we are ridiculously isolated from countries that we deem 'un-important' to the war on terror.\n \n If a poll were conducted and asked 'which government would you prefer to live under?' and the options were 'The United States' and 'China', the U.S. would win in a landslide. In other words, there is no deep love for China. It is all an illusion.",

'We'll take it under advisement'. Pakistan's next shipment of F16s included an identical hardware offer to India, terms unknown. Two years ago this administration wouldn't have bothered with India, a nuke power, or their border dispute with Pakistan. India now services US industry on an IT basis, in everything from critical call centers to design engineering, at a volume I'm now curious about. Last I heard, Pakistan's leader is still dodging bullets but they're working on democracy. The Iran/India pipeline is a go. If India can confine their unruly neighbors to a border dispute, and nukes can do that, I think they'll prosper on a mostly independent military defense basis.",

   "Your posts suggest otherwise.\n \n Interesting. See the thing is, the UK is there, alongside the rest of Europe in prefering China to the USA. So pehaps you should listen to us. And when you do listen, you will hear the UK sucking just as hard on that \"social welfare nipple\" as the rest of Europe. The UK is currently an example of a country with high taxes, a good welfare system and an exonomy that is sitting pretty. The USA doesn't have either a good welfare system or a good economy, so you might want to listen to us on that point too (we are saying you are a bunch of XXXXXX for re-electing Bush BTW, just in case you are wondering).\n \n Utter failure? Hmm, that one missed me. From here in Europe, I can see an EU that is doing pretty well considering it's a collection of 25 countries, each with their own interests. Sure, the constitution failed, but that is what happens in democracies: the population votes no to things they don't like and the polititians bitch for a while and try again. Now if we want to look at a real \"utter failure\", we need to look across the pond at the USA, with it's disasterous economic and foriegn policies of the last five years...\n\n \n \n Economy is fine. Policies are fine. Some don't like the policies, doesn't make them a failure, and I still don't care to set US national security interests based on the likes of European sentiments, as many there are in abig rush to sell arms to Chinese and I see the potential for armed conflict between them and my country.",

   "i thought this was an interesting analysis of the Pew poll in the WaPo \n \nIn fact, when pro- and anti-American sentiments are broken down by age, income and education -- I did so recently using polling data from the Program on International Policy Attitudes, supplied by Foreign Policy magazine -- patterns do emerge. It turns out, for example, that in Poland, which is generally pro-American, people between the ages of 30 and 44 are even more likely to support America than their compatriots. This is the group whose lives would have been most directly affected by the experience of the Solidarity movement and martial law -- events that occurred when they were in their teens and twenties -- and who have the clearest memories of American support for the Polish underground.\n \n It also turns out that in some more anti-American countries, such as Canada, Britain, Italy and Australia, people older than 60 have far more positive feelings about the United States than their children and grandchildren. This was the generation, of course, that had positive experiences of U.S. cooperation or occupation during World War II. And surely there's a lesson here: Although anti-Americanism is often described as if it were mere fashion, or some sort of contagious virus, America's behavior overseas, whether support for anticommunist movements or allied cooperation, does matter. To put it differently, people feel more positive about the United States when their personal experience is positive.\n \n But the polls also make clear that direct political experience is not the only factor that shapes foreigners' perceptions of the United States. Advertising executives understand very well the phenomenon of ordinary women who read magazines filled with photographs of clothes they could never afford: They call such women \"aspirational.\" Looking around the world, it is clear there are classes of people who might also be called aspirational. They are upwardly mobile, or would like to be. They tend to be pro-American, too.\n \n In Britain, for example, 57.6 percent of those whose income are low believe that the United States has a mainly positive influence in the world, while only 37.1 percent of those whose income are high believe the same. Breaking down the answers by education, a similar pattern emerges. In South Korea, 69.2 percent of those with low education think the United States is a positive influence, while only 45.8 percent of those with a high education agree. That trend repeats itself not only across Europe but in many other developed countries. Those on their way up are pro-American. Those who have arrived, and perhaps feel threatened by those eager to do the same, are much less so.\n \n In developing countries, by contrast, the pattern is sometimes reversed. It turns out, for example, that Indians are much more likely to be pro-American if they are not only younger but also wealthier and better educated, and no wonder. Because India has only recently been open to foreign investment, younger Indians have had the experience of working with Americans, whereas their parents have not. The poor in India are still untouched by globalization, but the middle and upper-middle classes -- those who see for themselves a role in the English-speaking, American-dominated international economy -- are aspirational, and therefore pro-American. Some 69 percent of Indians with high incomes think the United States is a mainly positive influence in the world, and only 29 percent of those with low incomes agree. This same phenomenon may also account for the persistence of a surprising degree of popular pro-Americanism in such places as Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil and the Philippines. They're getting wealthier -- like Americans -- but aren't yet so rich as to feel directly competitive.\n",
