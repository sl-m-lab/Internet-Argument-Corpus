   "Thank you, WarriorPoet for such an honest post. I am impressed by your commitment to being open-minded - to truly debating, and I hope I will learn from it. We all have biases and need to be aware of it when debating. Much of the debate in this forum is high-level and intelligent, and I'm impressed by that and hope to learn from it as well.\n I am new to these forums, so maybe what I have to say has been heard, but hopefully I can give some scientific arguements for creation. \n \n I think one of the strongest argument against evolution is the watch-maker arguement. Every day it gets stronger, as new discoveries are made about the miraculous(no other word truly describes it) complexity and beauty of the natural world. For one thing, such things as rotors and universal joints have been discovered in bacteria. (If you want references, ask and I'll try to find them) So the question is, how can we beleive that something so unbeleivably more complex than a watch as, say, myself was caused by completley random forces - when no-one would ever believe a watch lying on the ground had come to be by random forces as well?\n \n The complexity of living organisms exceeds that of anything intelligent humans have designed by leaps and bounds. So the basic point is, evolution(by which I mean elements to bacteria to humans) is a long-shot. The chances of a planet such as Earth, capable of supporting any carbon-based life for any amount of time, occuring randomly are so low that you would expect very few to arise, even in our entire universe. So there's another long-shot. The long-shot's pile up until you basically have this...\n \n The chance of random evolution occuring in our universe in 15 billion years, going from elements to people, are so low that the only possible way to believe in it occuring is to say there are an infinite number of random universes where evolution has a chance to occur, and it did occur in ours. But, according to science, individuals whithin a particular universe can never find evidence of another universe. So the scientific explanation must be based on there being only one universe. You can't assume there are other universes and still be scientific. So it comes down to something like this: We have flipped a coin ten-thousand times and it landed on heads every time. Yet some people say 'I don't beleive it is weighted, there must be millions of other people who are flipping coins as well, and we the the ones who happened to get only heads', while others say 'doesn't it make more sense if the coin is weighted, or two-headed?', and still others say 'of course the coin is weighted, we've know it for centuries!'.\n \n So, that is the most basic and general evidence that we were created, as I know it. I would be happy to hear what everyone has to say about it and try to elaborate on some of the general statements I made if you want something more specific.",

   "Thanks for the replies, 'The Blind Watchmaker' and 'Darwin's Black Box' are added to my book list. I've heard of 'Darwin's Black Box' before, but haven't read it. Actually, I am one of the creationists who've only read a few books, like WarriorPoet said. My arguments are based mostly on a book by Hugh Ross, I'm curious what you all think of him.\n \n So, first with the watch-maker arguement...\n \nI don't see why you think this is a strong arguement. I have never read of any discovery that has been labeled 'miraculous'. We can see many of the pathways evolution has taken, there is no process or organ that has mysteriously formed. How does the watchmaker arguement get stronger everyday? Clearly this is only wishful thinking on your part.\n\n \n I think it is a strong arguement simply because life is more complex than anything we creative and intelligent humans can match, therefore the most sensible beleif would be that life was created. Your statements seem to indicate that we now know a very detailed history of evolution. I was not aware of this, please give me some examples.\n \n \nYour igonorance of evolution is showing. Evolution doesn't claim that we were formed by completely random forces. Mutations are selected by nature, the environment they express themselves in, as to whether they are beneficial, detrimental or neutral. This is natural selection and is certainly not random. \n\n \n I agree partly with this statement - the main problem with the watchmaker argument is that it talks about completely random forces, whereas natural selection that 'favors' good mutations could be seen as non-random. However, there would be no natural selection before there was any life at all, so the first life would have had to be perfectly random. Also, though natural selection could be non-random, it is certainly not creative or intelligent (unless you want to start speaking of it as Nature, as some evolutionists understadably do) so I hold that even a psuedo-random force is very unlikely to have caused the kind of complexity we see in life.\n \n \n...evolution has been observed, it is a fact...\n\n \n Creation has been observed, it is a fact. Neither statement makes a good arguement, do they?\n \n \nWhat it really comes down to is the evidence. the evidence supporting the Theory of Evolution is overwhelming. Clearly it best explains the diversity of life on this planet. Supernatural creation, on the other hand, is completely without any evidence whatsoever. You cling to it on faith alone, faith in a book of primitive myths over 3000 years old.\n\n \n Again, I am not aware of all this evidence. Why would a random, or sortofnotrandom force explain the stunning diversity and beauty of our planet better than a superintelligent, creative God? Its not debating when you say you're right and I'm wrong. I think your ignorance of the Bible is showing. For one example, multiple times in the bible it says God stretched out the heavens, in the same sense as expanding a tent. It seems to me that these prophets knew about the Big Bang a long time before our scientists did.\n \n I haven't read 'The Blind Watchmaker' yet but I have come across a quote by Dawkins that pertains to the Watchmaker argument...\n \"Paley's argument is made with passionate sincerity and is informed by the best biological scholarship of the day, but it is wrong, gloriously and utterly wrong. The analogy between telescope and eye, between watch and living organism, is false. All appearances to the contrary, the only watchmaker in nature is the blind force of physics, albeit deplored in a special way. A true watchmaker has foresight: he designs his cogs and springs, and plans their interconnections, with a future porpose in his mind's eye. Natural selection, the blind unconscious, automatic process which Darwin discovered, and which we now know is the explanation for the existence and apparently purposeful form of all life, has no purpose in mind. It has no mind and no mind's eye. It does not plan for the future. It has no vision, no foresight, no sight at all. If it can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, it is the blind watchmaker.\"\n \n It seems to me that all Dawkins has done is say that Paley is wrong and outdated because his analogy speaks of random forces while natural selection does favor benificial genes. I don't see that it proves anything, since the heart of Paley's analogy is that life is more complex than anything we creative and intelligent humans can match, therefore the most sensible beleif would be that life was created by Someone who is superintellent and creative. (as I stated above)\n \n TheoMorphic: When I was talking about long-shots I did mean both the chance of life ever happening in the first place, and of it continuing to become more complex. I have some more specific arguments to give you from Hugh Ross's book (I think it is 'Creator of the Cosmos', but am not sure) but I don't have it at the moment.\n \n \nthe truth is there are 2 limiting factors in the probability calculation. 1) we don't know how likely it is that life would arise by chance. Claims that we do know the probability are based on many many factors that are complete guesses. and 2) we don't know how often life has just happened by chance. it is possible that there is simple (or even complex) life on thousands and thousands of other planets. we just don't know about them. Of course it is also possible that there is no life except for us in the universe. but as for the actual probability calculation... right now it's just a big giant question mark.\n\n \n Interesting. Again, I'm wishing I had that book right now. You definatly have a good point, but surely you would admit that the probablities are, in the least, somewhat mind-boggling.\n \n \nbut actually, most of this is beside the point. evolution deals with the mutation of compelx life from non complex life. it says nothing about the original probability of life forming. Evolution must explain how probable speciation has occurred, and possible how probable it is for single celled organisms to become multi celled organisms.\n\n \n This is an important point. When I think of evolution, I always think of the Athestic Evolution, which seems to almost scramble desperately in its attempt to be rid of God and sets up Nature in His place. (I mean no offense to Atheists, just that I think you often are deeply biased in favor of evolution only because it seems to prove there is no God. And, of course, I am biased too.) So, are we to debate only evolution, after life had already begun, or do you want to include other feilds?\n \n Lurch, you complain about creationists trying to 'impose your religion on everyone under the guise of science?'\n \n I have a complaint to make too. I object to Atheists trying to prove there is no God by way of evolution. They impose their religion on others just as much, if not more.",

Your statements seem to indicate that we now know a very detailed history of evolution. I was not aware of this, please give me some examples. \n \n I don't think it follows that because we can't create complex life, it must have been a greater creator, God. At one point man did not understand electricity, could not create electricity, therefore does it follow that the primitive people who attributed it to the gods were right because they couldn't create lightning bolts? This is a God of the Gaps arguement, if/when we can create complex cells and lifeforms, does this disprove creationism? As for a 'very detailed history of evolution' how detailed are you talking about? Take a look at the fossils for reptile to mammal evolution, or the evolution of the whale, or human evolution. I think examples such as these and hundreds more overwhelmingly support the theory of evolution. Incremental changes, selected for by the environment over generations can radically change organisms, complexity can dramatically increase. And while we can see many of the mechanisms of evolution at work, there is still no evidence of supernatural intervention.\n \n However, there would be no natural selection before there was any life at all, so the first life would have had to be perfectly random.

(And I even spelled it wrong, talk about 'igonorance'......)\n And the formation of life isn't part of the theory of evolution. Since we don't know the exact conditions when life first formed, we can't know how random it was. As for natural selection, no of course it isn't creative or intelligent. But for the myriad ecological niches, changing environments, I think it is the best explaination. The fact that evolution uses what works and doesn't somehow design the best systems and adaptations for any given environment, to me, is evidence that an unintelligent force has shaped the diversity of life on the planet, not a creative, omniscient creator.\n \n Creation has been observed, it is a fact. Neither statement makes a good arguement, do they? \n \n I have to disagree with you here. Evolution has been observed, mutations that cause the change, the environment that they express themselves in. We can point to it and study it. But I have yet to see a creationist point to a specific organism and say \"See, this is an example of creation because....\" and then give a plausible explaination.\n \n Again, I am not aware of all this evidence.

It seems to me that these prophets knew about the Big Bang a long time before our scientists did. \n \n A non random force acting on an uncountable number of ecological niches that periodically change, sometimes dramatically, would produce a stunning array of diversity. As for evidence, look at the fossil record, \n we see a progression of change, we don't see static creatures that suddenly appear and show no signs of evolution. We don't see a mixture of older, more primitive organisms with modern organisms, the fossil record is in a temporal order that is predicted by the theory of evolution. Genetics shows organisms that we observe to be closely related are genetically more similar, just as the theory of evolution predicts.\n As for my ignorance of the Bible, well, I've read it more than few times.\n I still don't believe it is a book of science and I don't think the prophets had any idea of modern scientific theories.

Did you not read my quote from Michel de Montaigne?\n \n \nwhat requirement of science does it violate?\n\n \n Simply put there is a huge amount of speculation based on small pieces of evidence. Take for example mutually exclusive theories that it contains, quite happily. I've documented these on other posts, such as the several different schools of thought how mankind arose.

A better analogy would have been any other star, but the principle's the same. What you observe is true, but to a point.\n \n \nGod himself could have come down and put the first self replicating molecules in the primordial ooze, and evolution as it exists would be exactly the same. \n\n \n Did you not read my post about the allegorical approach to the Bible? Sometimes I feel that you don't read what I've written.(but see below)\n \n \nyeah? you?ve been saying evidence you present has been smugly rejected, and I just keep assuming you mean the bible. What else do you propose as evidence? What is holy tradition?\n\n \n You assume wrongly... The single biggest Christian denomination is the Catholic Church. Next biggest is the Orthodox Church. Both these follow Holy Tradition. Not numerically as great are the Coptic Churches. So, you've simply argued past the majority of Christians.\n \n Holy Tradition is the faith of the Orthodox Church. It is the Bible as interpreted by the Church. We believe that Holy Tradition is the Bible as best understood. So, likewise, if you read a law, you might want an interpretation of the law, so you pick up a law book, hopefully written by someone who's studied the subject.\n \n Likewise we have the Church Fathers, and lesser writers who have commentated on the Scripture.\n \n The basis for this is... the Bible didn't fall out of heaven fully written. It took time to compile. The first teachings of Christ were oral. Christ commissioned his Apostles to go out and preach in His name. They did so, they established the early Church and the offices therein.\n \n When it came time to put the Bible together the Church gathered together and looked at over a hundred books that were in circulation. They said \"Which of these are in keeping with what we've always taught?\" and guided by the Holy Spirit they compiled the Bible.\n \n Peter, who knew Jesus, taught others their faith. Clement of Rome was one of his disciples. Clement also wrote on issues, so we can read Clement's epistle. Ignatius of Antioch's another one. All the way down to the present when we have writers today.\n \n What you are critiquing therefore is but a tiny part of our Christianity. Like trying to discern Australia society by reading the few pages of our Constitution only.\n \n Thus, on another post, when dealing with the Orthodox idea of love and marriage, I listed sources:\n Those who have written about love, marriage (that is a union under God of a man with a woman) and sexuality:\n Basil the Great (330-79)\n Gregory of Nyssa (331-95)\n John Chrysotomon (347-407)\n The Desert Fathers (4th-5th centuries)\n Isaiah the Solitary (5th century)\n Diadochos of Photike (5th century)\n Dorotheos of Gaza (6th century)\n Gregory the Great (540-604)\n Theodore the Ascetic (7th century)\n Maximos the Confessor (580-662)\n Thaslassios the Libyan (7th century)\n Dionysios the Areopagite (c.500)\n John Klimakos (579-649)\n Symeon the New Theologian (949-1022)\n Nicholas Kavasilas (1322-96)\n Symeon of Thessalonika (d.1429)\n Dimitri of Rostov (1651-1709)\n Macarius of Optino (1788-1860)\n Ignatius Brianchaninov (1807-67)\n John of Kronstad (1829-1908)\n Silouan of Athos (1866-1938)\n Alexander Elchaninov (1881-1934)\n Kallistos of Diokleia (b.1934)\n list taken from \"Love, Sexuality, and the Sacrament of Marriage\" by John Chryssavgis\n \n Or, on Genesis, I could go to the writings of some of the Church Fathers who have written on this particular subject; John Chysotomon, Epharim the Syrian, Basil the Great, Ambrose of Milan, John Damascene, Anthanasius the Great, Gregory of Nyssa et al.

   "I have been thinking about what lurch said about us creationists wanting to convice people to accept Jesus Christ as their savior and friend. It's quite simple really. If you beleived a person would suffer unimaginable despair if they didn't, would you keep it to yourself?\n \n \nThe goal of atheists is not to prove there is no god... well... there may be some like this, but for the most part they are concerned with discovering the truth through science. Science doesn't even try to take a stance on god. it's always going to remain \"there is no evidence either for or against the existence of god. \n\n \n It's my opinion that atheists are motivated by their faith just as much as creationists. They champion evolution because they think it says there is no God, and because it does say that God took no personal part in our creation. Very few are the pure scientists with no belief one way or the other. If any. So in some theories science says nothing about God, but in practice it is not that way. Maybe I'm getting off topic, but I am convinced that the same biases creationists are accused of exist equally on the other side. It seems to me that the atheists make too big a deal out of the bias a creationist has, when they have it too.\n \n I don't think science can provide no evidence for the existence of God, rather, no proof.\n \n \n Firstly sorry about the ignorant crack I made, I'm not here to insult. (And I even spelled it wrong, talk about 'igonorance'......) \n\n \n :) Here I was expecting just another arrogant evolutionist who'd never cracked a Bible cover when you come out and say this! I was wrong to assume you were ignorant about the Bible, but then I was justifyably steamed up when you said I was clinging to primitive myths by faith alone, although I have begun by pure faith. Primitive myth wasn't the most neutral description of what I (hopefully) live by.\n \n When I said that the statement 'creation is fact' is not a good standalone arguement, I was trying to say that you kept saying stuff like - well - 'evolution is fact' without giving me any reason or evidence I could look at.\n \n \nA non random force acting on an uncountable number of ecological niches that periodically change, sometimes dramatically, would produce a stunning array of diversity. As for evidence, look at the fossil record, we see a progression of change, we don't see static creatures that suddenly appear and show no signs of evolution. We don't see a mixture of older, more primitive organisms with modern organisms, the fossil record is in a temporal order that is predicted by the theory of evolution. Genetics shows organisms that we observe to be closely related are genetically more similar, just as the theory of evolution predicts.\n\n \n Finally, you made a statement that tried to show the logic behind evolutionary theory, rather than saying its right! I mean no offense, but you've been talking as if there was no need for logic to accompany your statements that evolution is fact. OK, first with the other statements... I honestly don't know where to find the fossil records you speak of, that's my problem here! Where in the theory of evolution does it say that organisms related genetically should be similar??? \n I think it's something else to say a pseudo-random force would produce the array of diversity we see, but that's just me I guess :) What do you say about irreducibly complex structures?\n \n \nI don't think it follows that because we can't create complex life, it must have been a greater creator, God. At one point man did not understand electricity, could not create electricity, therefore does it follow that the primitive people who attributed it to the gods were right because they couldn't create lightning bolts? This is a God of the Gaps arguement, if/when we can create complex cells and lifeforms, does this disprove creationism? As for a 'very detailed history of evolution' how detailed are you talking about? Take a look at the fossils for reptile to mammal evolution, or the evolution of the whale, or human evolution. I think examples such as these and hundreds more overwhelmingly support the theory of evolution. Incremental changes, selected for by the environment over generations can radically change organisms, complexity can dramatically increase. And while we can see many of the mechanisms of evolution at work, there is still no evidence of supernatural intervention.\n\n \n The point is, if years and years of purposed work by us intelligent, creative humans still hasn't changed 'primordial soup' in the most favorable conditions into any form of life(I'm talking about the attempts to cause abiogenisis) then surely it's unlikely that random forces could have, unless given infinity universes to work in. And no it isn't proof. It is saying that the most logical cause is the one to pick. And yes, this isn't talking about evolution per se, it is talking about Atheistic Evolution.\n And if the whole history of creative human effort cannot hope to match life then how likely is it for a non-intelligent, non-creative force to have done it?\n \n You've said: \"We can see many of the pathways evolution has taken, there is no process or organ that has mysteriously formed.\" basically implying that we've mapped out the evolutionary history of all processes and organs. Where can I find these maps? Where can I find an observed case of drastic complexity increase? We only see the mecanisms of micro-evolution, we haven't seen species change. Has evolution stopped? Why do 0 new species occur, while thousands upon thousands dissapear? You speak as if evolution were everyday common sense and I say that I must have missed something if this is the case, and won't you please show me where I can find what I've missed!",

But at the end of the day one scientific theory will hold, and the others will be falsified.\n\n \n It would seem rather odd.

This is no idle thought; Crick first proposed it with chemist Leslie Orgel in 1973 in an article entitled \"Directed Panspermia\" in a professional science journal called Icarus.

I certainly don't. \n \n \nYou in fact have faith that the sun still exists. You are just not aware of it.\n\n \n I suppose in a way that's faith, but it's very different from religious faith. Religious faith can exist with out any evidence, however, every time we see the sun, that is further evidence that it exists. It's \"faith\" (or a belief) but it is not void of any evidence. The sun has always existed before... why should it stop now?\n \n \nMost of them wrote before Darwin was even thought of. As I said, the evidence comes from God, as experienced through these people. I implore you to read the quote I gave from Michel de Montaigne. Actually I'll add it at bottom\n\n \n I fail to see how the time the article was written has anything to do with it's validity. No one (except for, as you say, god) was around for the first creation, so any revelations that say he did it would have to come through him. \n \n \nYour argument being that none of these religions can possibly be true because there are so many of them. But you accept all the theories of evolution as being true.\n\n \n 1) no I don't accept all theories of evolution to be true. I believe one theory will withstand the test of time, and will be shown to be a much better model than all the other. And you make it sound like there are some huge discrepancies. The discrepancies come from details that could have happened in several different ways. They all believe evolution happened. for example, if you and several other people were to see a car crash, you would all know a car crash happened. but you may not agree on if a man or a woman was driving, or the time of day, or the color of the car... however debating the details does not take away from the fact that the car crash did happen...\n \n however, more importantly:\n \n 2) You claim personal revelations are valid evidences for your religion... would you take the same stance on personal revelations concerning OTHER religions? I'm not saying this is proof to cancel them all out. What I mean to gain is to find out if you are either a hypocrite, or you'll admit that other religions have valid supporting evidence (according to you).",

That\n a) I know God exists\n or\n b) That people can have religious experiences.\n \n People having religious experience: I believe a person who says they have a religious experience, I'm not judging them of that. You are. I said the sources of that experience are varied. Some people can have a religious experience having sex, or smoking dope. I never said that I doubted their genuineness at all. You doubt it because you don't believe in religious experiences, just science. You might accept that they are having an 'experience' but that it is not religious or supernatural. So, let's look at genuinely supernatural experience...\n \n People having 'genuine' religious experience in the sense of what you really mean... that is an experience with something/someone supernatural. And again I don't doubt Hindus, Muslims, non-Orthodox are having genuine experiences with the super-natural. But you'd doubt this too. Even though you accept the limitations of science (as stated in an earlier post) you don't accept the notion of people who have extra-science experience. I find this odd. I can't understand what you're arguing against, unless you have some 'third way' idea that's neither supernatural/religious, nor scientific.\n \n The supernatural is a big place. That is why I suggested that their experiences come from different sources. I believe mine come from God. There are many being out there: God, angels, demons, Satan.\n \n Another issue here is certainty. And here again, at best, you are uncertain of what you believe in and are trying through logic to show flaws in why I should be certain of my beliefs; even though you also admit you're not out to convert anyone. This makes no sense. You admit there's a small possibility that you might just be a brain in a box... so why then do you believe in what you believe in? How do you know anything you experience is 'real' in the sense that it doesn't just exist by your experience of it?\n \n IF you don't know, then why believe in particular in evolution and why not religion? -what is it about not believing in God that appeals?\n \n IF you are certain, then why is it amazing that I would be certain too, especially when you claim that the two aren't mutually exclusive? Or is it that you are certain, and you just want to see if I've come to this certainty the same way you have?\n \n How do you know anything? How do you know that is real? What if your experiences are just an attempt to put into order a jumble of feelings?\n \n Here's a very long argument about the existence of God. I hope you spend many days reading it.\n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608b.htm\n \n \nand actually... it wouldn't matter how many Christians you found in the rest of the world. in regards to people who support evolution MOST also believe in a god.

I'm agnostic. I believe it can't be known whether a god exists or not. You may think you know, but you don't actually know. Again, see above for a challenge.\n \n I'm not trying to prove there is not god. I'm trying to get you to understand you can't be certain whether a god exists or not. I've already admitted I can't be sure whether the earth orbits the sun... however all my observations indicated that the earth does orbit the sun. \n \n Just because you admit that you don't KNOW something for certain, doesn't mean you have to drop that belief. \n \n \nHow do you know anything?

   "Originally Posted by montalban\n What is your problem that I accept God's teachings and reject people's teachings that don't come from God? How is that 'hypocritical'? I am in fact practicing what I preach. I accept that their experiences are true (see below), but come from different sources than mine. I have stated this, you seem to believe that I believe it... so what's your problem? Why would I accept evidence from something I believe to be an unreliable source?\n \n Theomorphic said: You insist science should accept individuals testimony that messaged from God, are actually from God, and should be used as evidence. However, you only want to accept religious testimony that comes from people who say they heard YOUR God. \n \n \n Firstly, I don't say science should accept individuals testimony as evidence. I said you should. You are not science. Crim too rejected out of hand that testimony was evidence.\n \n Secondly, you didn't address the idea that you reject all religious experiences as being genuine at all. You accept that I don't believe in the same things as a lot of other religious people, but carte blanche you've rejected all our experiences in toto, because they're not based on science! Where is the rationale in that? Is that not hypocritical, by your own definition?\n BUT\n You've changed subtly here. At first you were saying that I didn't accept in toto anyone else's religious experience as a genuine religious experience, now it's just those experiences from God that I accept. Not at all. Satan hears from my God. I don't accept his word at all. Never said that either. I accept the revelations by God however as revealed to the Orthodox Church.\n \n The unreliable source to which I reference is 'man' it is for this reason I don't put all my hopes in evolution. You deny religious experience as 'evidence'\n I DO NOT!\n What I said was I believe that my experience comes from God. I didn't say that their's aren't also super-natural in origin. You do that.\n \n You accept all the conflicting evidences of evolution, because they all point to evolution. I accept all the conflicting evidences of religion because they point to God! What is your problem here? Like you, I accept that one of these is the truth. I told you either on this thread or another, that I don't deny a Hindu his religious experience is genuine at all.\n \n Again this is because your belief system is superior to mine. You can believe in evolution despite the different testimony, but I can't believe in God? But let's look at your evidences...\n \n Originally Posted by montalban\n However, I'd like to revisit what you said... quote:\"You accept ?evidence? that supports your belief (because it comes from a reliable source), and reject ?evidence? that does not support your belief (because it obviously comes from a fallacious source)\" is something you do! You are being hypocritical, by your own standards! For, not only do you not accept religious evidence as anything other than subjective experience, you don't even believe all that you consider 'objective' evidence. You said in an earlier post \" no I don?t accept all theories of evolution to be true\" So\n a) how do you know which evolutionary truths are true?\n b) what makes you certain that these are right, when other scientists can give rational explanations for their beliefs?\n \n Theomorphic said: what objective evidence (not religious, because that?s in question) do I not believe? You say I don?t even consider all objective evidence? please give me a few examples (my definition of objective evidence).\n \n I say: \n Again, you've just written-off every genuine religious experience with the wave of your hand. This is because a priori you've accepted that there is no God. You get around this by saying your beliefs are based on objective truths.\n \n You believe that evolution is couched in objective evidence. I say it can't be 'objective'; proofed by the fact you have so many different and conflicting theories. Not very 'objective'.\n But then how do you explain away these conflicts...?\n \n Theomorphic: As for evolution: I don?t know what theories are true? but I?m pretty sure it only happened one way. Not several. When everything is known about the earth?s past (physical evidence only) one theory of evolution will survive over the others. Science doesn?t claim to know everything about evolution? studies are still being done, and ideas are still being tossed around. In the end I?m pretty sure one ?rational? belief will continue to be rational, and other will become irrational (and woe be to the scientist who clings to his scientific ?truth? despite evidence contrary).\n \n \n Here you are contradicting yourself again. You claimed in another post that science will always have an element of uncertainty, now you're saying effectively, 'given enough time... one truth will emerge' That's just faith again. But it's supposedly superior faith, because what? It's based on faith in science?\n \n Effectively you're arguing these sets of arguments\n a) My religious experience is not genuine evidence because other people have other religious experiences.\n b) Your experience of evolution is evidence, despite the fact that there are a number of different 'experiences' to be had from evolution.\n \n a) Science can't know all the facts... but is still to be relied upon over everything else\n b) One day science will have the answers\n \n So in effect, your system of beliefs is more rational and logical than mine, based on the fact that you believe in your beliefs not mine.\n \n You still haven't really addressed the issue of why you believe in what you believe. You pass this off as something that you just happen to, until something else is proved to you.\n \n So, why believe in it at all? Why not believe in a god, or a number of gods.\n \n This is the failing of your argument - you've started with a lack of faith in God, and worked your way back from that to establish your frame-work for thinking.\n \n You keep getting back to this thing too about your perceptions being superior to mine... although sometimes you say you just want me to concede that I should have some doubt, because you do, and yet you are certain that there's no certainty!

   "Your lack of knowledge about the scientific method is appalling. Really it is. I suggest you do some serious research into what the scientific method is, why it's tentative, why it's so powerful, why it's such a good system to build a basis of knowledge, and why it is very limited. \n \n You don't even have to agree with the scientific method... but until you should at least educate yourself you'll continue to look like a XXXXX for ascribing religious attributes to science. For example:\n \n \nYou accept all the conflicting evidences of evolution, because they all point to evolution.\n \n You can believe in evolution despite the different testimony, but I can't believe in God? \n \n This is because a priori you've accepted that there is no God. You get around this by saying your beliefs are based on objective truths.\n \n You believe that evolution is couched in objective evidence. I say it can't be 'objective'; proofed by the fact you have so many different and conflicting theories. Not very 'objective'. \n \n You claimed in another post that science will always have an element of uncertainty, now you're saying effectively, 'given enough time... one truth will emerge' That's just faith again. \n \n Your experience of evolution is evidence, despite the fact that there are a number of different 'experiences' to be had from evolution. \n \n Science can't know all the facts... but is still to be relied upon over everything else\n \n One day science will have the answers\n \n You pass this off as something that you just happen to, until something else is proved to you. \n\n \n All these comments hint that you lack a basic understanding about the scientific method, and certain definitions about science. I suggest taking some time here:\n http://phyun5.ucr.edu/~wudka/Physics7/Notes_www/node5.html\n I looked over it, and it doesn't seem too overwhelming. \n \n \nYou keep getting back to this thing too about your perceptions being superior to mine... \n\n \n I've never said my perception is superior to yours. I've said I only rely on evidence that I can confirm.",

How do you know? \n\n \n Well, regardless of if you actually have doubts or not, you don't know if what you believe is absolutely true. Go watch \"The Truman Show\", \"The Matrix\" and \"The thirteenth floor\"... wait... not sure about that last one... I reserve the right to change the movie title of that last one. \n \n All these movies point to the fact that we can't absolutely know what we observe is a reflection of reality.

Science says \"well of course we can't absolutely know if this is accurate... but so far we have no reason to believe it's inaccurate, so we'll continue just assuming it is right until we have reason to believe otherwise\". \n \n Ok, this next part is long, so bear with me.\n \n \"Why We Don't Know: Chapter 1\":\n Pretend instead of the God you know of there was instead a malicious and deceitful god. Now this god didn't create the universe... actually his only power is to send psychic feelings and messages to creatures with brains. So this God is sitting in the empty universe minding his own business when suddenly the big bang happens, and matter is strewn about the universe. Billions of years later life starts to crop up on this planet earth. This God decides to have some fun with a newly emerging species that is showing to be incredibly smart and clever when compared to the other animals. So this God starts telling them things in their head. He starts impressing stories onto them,... now this along with their oral tradition they get the idea that some God created the universe as they see it today, and they should listen to this God. Well some doubting Thomases crop up and they ask \"well how can we be sure this God is who he says he is?\". Well another one of the messages God had passed down is that you had to have faith no matter what. To do otherwise is evil. So these doubting Thomases are ignored, or persecuted, and so they shut up. So eventually this God sees attention to him is waning, so he find 4 really really gullible people and starts to give them story after story that they must write down and put into a single book. They do it, and include themselves as main characters. Of course the entire book isn't an outright lie... there is a mix of history, but a lot of the stuff just never happened. Fast forward to 2000 years and now you have supporters and believers in this book all over the world. Now you still have some doubting Thomases, but people who believe the religion are convinced they are right because every time they pray to their God they get messages and warm feelings inside. Sometimes he even grants miracles for them (as it turns out though this isn't in his power... fortunate things just happen to them every once in a while and he takes credit for it). And these people just don't quite remember all the times that they asked for something, and it wasn't delivered. After all, God moves in mysterious ways. \n ~fin~\n \n Ok that was kind of winded, and I know the story seems absurd... but how does this story (in the end) differ from real life as we see it today? We have a holy book, and believers based on individual experience, and it is exactly what we see today. How could you tell this world from our world now? by the way you're not allowed to say \"I would just know\" .",

   "Robbie, sorry it took me a while to get back to you.\n but then I was justifyably steamed up when you said I was clinging to primitive myths by faith alone, although I have begun by pure faith. \n Let me just say I don't think your faith is primitive, you've found something that works to make your life better, so I say good for you, you're a lucky man. But I still think that a belief in a six day creation, a global flood, denying evolution are primitive attempts at explaining some of the big questions. I don't see how you can exclude the evidence we've accumulated since the Bible was written solely on faith. My intent is not to insult you but that's how I feel.\n \n Finally, you made a statement that tried to show the logic behind evolutionary theory, rather than saying its right! I mean no offense, but you've been talking as if there was no need for logic to accompany your statements that evolution is fact. \n OK, but evolution is a fact, we see it occur. We see organisms adapting to there environment, we see new species forming so we see macroevolution in action. Look up stuff like nylon eating bacteria, Farhoe Island mouse for just a few examples of new species we have ovserved evolving. We understand and can observe and test some of the mechanisms, like mutation. Biologists overwhelmingly concurr, evolution does occur. \n Where in the theory of evolution does it say that organisms related genetically should be similar???  \n I'm getting a little out of my league, but all mammals have hair, produce milk, all fish have gills, etc....,their are similarities between organisms and their genetic structure will support this and does.\n What do you say about irreducibly complex structures? \n I say show me one. All the examples proponents of IC have used have been shown to have plausible evolutionary pathways, the eye, flagellum, blood clotting, I haven't seen a structure that is irreducibly complex. Give me an example of an IC structure and we'll discuss it.\n The point is, if years and years of purposed work by us intelligent, creative humans still hasn't changed 'primordial soup' in the most favorable conditions into any form of life(I'm talking about the attempts to cause abiogenisis) then surely it's unlikely that random forces could have, unless given infinity universes to work in. And no it isn't proof. It is saying that the most logical cause is the one to pick. And yes, this isn't talking about evolution per se, it is talking about Atheistic Evolution. \n But we still don't know what was in the original primordial soup! This existed roughly 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. So far we haven't been able to find anything but the faintest of clues as to what it was made of. Your arguement seems to be \"if we haven't been able to do it by now, we never will and that proves only God could have started life\". God of the gaps arguement. Science hasn't discovered everything, we don't know everything. But we continue to learn, we continue to explore, we continue to investigate. Would you have us stop experimenting with the origins of life because some fundamentalist Christians think it's futile? NASA is planning to launch a probe to Satun's moon Titan because it looks like it's atmosphere may be like primordial earths, isn't this a worthy undertaking? \n You've said: \"We can see many of the pathways evolution has taken, there is no process or organ that has mysteriously formed.\" basically implying that we've mapped out the evolutionary history of all processes and organs.  \n OK, once again, I might be getting in over my head but there are evolunarily plausible explainations for most processes and organs. Check a good book on evolution or biology. I'm sure there are still some that are a mystery but over all, we can trace the evolution of most organs and processes back to their most likely origins. Hey I'm not a proffesional biologists, so if someone more qualified wants to support or correct me, I'd love to hear it.\n Where can I find an observed case of drastic complexity increase? \n Look up nylon eating bacteria, an organism that experiences a frame shift mutation and then gains the ability to digest nylon which it didn't have before, certainly sounds like a drastic increase in complexity to me.\n We only see the mecanisms of micro-evolution, we haven't seen species change. Has evolution stopped \n But microevolution and macroevolution are essential the same, they use the same verified mechanisms. What prevents the accumulation of micro changes from adding up to a macro change? What is that barrier?\n Don't just say \"we see microevolution but macroevolution is impossible...\"\n show me why it's impossible. We have seen new species arise, I think I gave a few examples previously, so evolution certainly hasn't stopped. In fact, all life is actually in transition.\n won't you please show me where I can find what I've missed! \n Their are a lot of books on the subject. You can check out the TalkOrigins website, many creationists don't like it but it has a wealth of information and they site all their sources so you can double check them.\n At the very least, you need a better understanding of the theory of evolution just to argue against it more effectively.",

I don't actually beleive in 6-day creation. Instead, I beleive that the days in Genesis actually meant ages. Support for this is: In Isaiah it says that to God, a thousand years is like a day(sorry I don't remember the exact reference), Adam named all the living creatures in one 'day', and after each day it says the day ended - but it doesn't say that after the 7th day... possibly suggesting that the 7th 'day' is still continuing. I don't think I exclude evidence... a few years ago I was having doubts about my faith since the media protrays science as anti-Christianity. It seemed as if evolution was a completly given thing, that it was common knowledge that abiogenisis had occured and that the universe had popped out of nothing and nothing else made sense. I have since come across scientific and common-sense reasons why beleif in God makes sense. If I hadn't, the only way I could have held onto my faith would be to 'bury my head in the sand'. The fact that I'm involved on this board shows that I haven't.\n \n \n OK, but evolution is a fact, we see it occur.

'Plausible' is a lot different from fact, which is how you first presented it. It may be plausible for evolution to have occured - if there are huge numbers of chances for it to occur... like near infinity earth-like planets or near-infinity universes... we can't discover the universes, so I'd have to see evidence for huge numbers of carbon based life-supporting planets in our universe before I could consider evolution as a possible explanation for the biological complexity we see. Otherwise, the chances are really quite impossible.\n \n \n look up nylon eating bacteria, an organism that experiences a frame shift mutation and then gains the ability to digest nylon which it didn't have before, certainly sounds like a drastic increase in complexity to me. \n\n \n Well, that sounds pretty cool. Have you heard of a discovery that some bacteria populations that were beleived to be mutating and changing in response to antibiotics were actually going through a regular cycle... it was something like the 'mutation' actually occured every few generations regardless of antiboitic exposure?\n \n \n We only see the mecanisms of micro-evolution, we haven't seen species change.

We have seen new species arise, I think I gave a few examples previously, so evolution certainly hasn't stopped. In fact, all life is actually in transition. \n\n \n Assuming that there really have been several species arrive, they certainly don't keep up with the numbers dissapearing, so why is this? \n Again, I've never heard that micro and macro evolution are so much the same. Did I say 'macroevolution is impossible' ? These are good points, though. Please don't think I'm avoiding them, but I have to go. I'll try to adress them later.",

   "It seemed as if evolution was a completly given thing, that it was common knowledge that abiogenisis had occured and that the universe had popped out of nothing and nothing else made sense.  \n \n Evolution is a given thing, it does happen, we have observed it in our life times, we see bacteria evolving in the lab, we genetically engineer bacteria in the lab. we see new species evolving in the wild and the fossil record can be explained by no other theory except the theory of evolution. Abiogenesis is not a theory yet. We do not have enough evidence, I think it is the most likely source of life on this planet but that is only my opinion. The Big Bang has a great amount of evidence supporting it and it is in the realm of possiblity according to current models that it did pop out of nothing, but once again not enough evidence to conclude what came before it (OK, actually no evidence).\n \n This supports genetics. This doesn't support evolution \n \n But genetics supports evolution. DNA is subject to mutation, we have seen beneficial mutations arise. That's all evolution needs.\n \n Well, I was thinking about the eye. Could you explain to me what the plausible evolutionary pathways are? \n \n I would think that since we see all grades of eyes in the world of nature from simple spots of photosensitive chemicals to the highly refined vision of the hawk, the eye can not possibly be Irreducibly complex. We see all the levels, we can see how the eye got more complex, we can deduce what mutations and changes were needed to make it more complex. After all, if we see simpler eyes occurring in nature, how can you say that any eye can not made even simpler? Here's a good web site that goes into more detail than I could:\n http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lindsay/creation/eye_stages.html\n \n What I'm saying is that intellgent humans haven't figured it out, creative beings can't match it, so it is more likely that it was done by a superintelligent and creative being than random forces, natural selection, and mutations.  \n \n But are you claiming that humans have figured out everything yet? I don't accept your point that just because we haven't figured it out YET, God had to do it. That is what the God of the gaps arguement is! If we don't understand it, must have been God! Why is it more likely that a supernatural being who we have no evidence even exists, sidestepped the natural laws He had to have set up and popped life into existance?\n We have seen complex organic molecules form, true we haven't seen life form yet and I can't discount the possiblity that God (or some other supernatural entity) did create that first life, but I find it much more likely it formed on it's own in accord with the natural world. And we have seen mutation and natural selection in action in the natural world.\n \n I disagree that Christianity is anti-science. Many universities were founded by Christians. Newton was Christian, wasn't he? \n \n And who said Christianity is anti science? Not me! Many Christians are scientists and very good scientists.

   "My but aren't you the argumentative one. 1st, just saying I am wrong does not make it so. Evolution is a deduction based on allele changes. It is not the only possibility, it is one. \n \n From here:\n http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000D4FEC-7D5B-1D07-8E49809EC588EEDF\n \n \"In addition to the theory of evolution, meaning the idea of descent with modification, one may also speak of the fact of evolution. The NAS defines a fact as \"an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as 'true.'\" The fossil record and abundant other evidence testify that organisms have evolved through time. Although no one observed those transformations, the indirect evidence is clear, unambiguous and compelling. \n \n All sciences frequently rely on indirect evidence. Physicists cannot see subatomic particles directly, for instance, so they verify their existence by watching for telltale tracks that the particles leave in cloud chambers. The absence of direct observation does not make physicists' conclusions less certain.\"\n \n From here:http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/4414_facts_faith_and_fairness_12_7_2000.asp\n \n \"But in science, a theory is a statement of general principles that explain many facts by means of natural processes. The proposition that the planets revolve around the sun (Copernican theory) explains a great many astronomical facts and also is considered true beyond a reasonable doubt. In the same way, geological examination of rocks demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the earth is extremely old. The theory of evolution explains a tremendous number of biological and paleontological facts, and it, too, is true beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, all these theories could be altered or replaced if new observations yielded new scientific evidence that contradicted predictions of these theories.\"\n \n OK, so now it's not just me saying you're wrong, it's Scientific American, the National Academy of Science and the National Center for Science Education. Is that enough for you?\n \n I will say this again, One CANNOT observe evolution. It is not observable. \n \n As a scientist you use a particularly narrow definition of 'observe', doesn't observation of evidence count? In the case of the nylon eating bacteria we know that there was no population of these bacterium before 1935, nylon didn't exist. But then suddenly they appear and can consume nylon. With extensive DNA examination, we can see that this organism could not consume nylon before a frame shift mutation created a new enzyme that allowed it to metabolize nylon. What would you call the research and conclusions reached about this organism?\n From here: http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm\n \n \"This case is most interesting. Nylon didn't exist before 1935, and neither did this organism. Detailed examination of the DNA sequences of the original bacterium and of the nylon-ingesting version show identical versions in the gene for a key metabolic enzyme, with only one difference in over 400 nucleotides. However, this single microevolutionary addition of a single thymine ('T') nucleotide caused the new bacterium's enzyme to be composed of a completely novel sequence of amino acids, via the mechanism of frame shifting. The new enzyme is 50 times less efficient than its precursor, as would be expected for a new structure which has not had time to be polished by natural selection. However, this inefficiency would certainly not be expected in the work of an intelligent designer. The genetic mutation that produced this particular irreducibly-complex enzyme probably occurred countless times in the past, and probably was always lethal, until the environment changed, and nylon was introduced.\"\n \n Now I'll grant you, probably no one has directly observed a new organism being born and actually seeing the new species being born and recognizing it for what it is (although I could be wrong about that....), but you give the impression that indirect observation is not enough to draw a strong conclusion......is this your intent?\n \n As for your argument that because mutations occur and natural selection occurs that is all that is needed for evolution to happen. True, but it does not mean that evolution must happen.  \n \n What? What does it mean if the allele frequencies of a population change? What besides evolution has occurred? Take the example of the nylon eating bacteria above, we know what the mutation was, we know were it occurred, we know that because it occurred in an environment that contained nylon, it was a beneficial mutation, what else would you call it, what other theory explains it if not the theory of evolution?\n \n I have done many lab experiments mutating the genes of various animals and insects and plants. I have yet to cause a mutation that did not harm the animal. \n \n But you do know that mutations in and of themselves are neutral, whether they are beneficial or detrimental is based on the environment they express themselves in. What experiments did you conduct to cause the mutations and how did you determine whether they were all harmfull to the organisms if the environment determines this?",

   " Evolution is a given thing, it does happen, we have observed it in our life times, we see bacteria evolving in the lab, we genetically engineer bacteria in the lab. we see new species evolving in the wild and the fossil record can be explained by no other theory except the theory of evolution. Abiogenesis is not a theory yet. We do not have enough evidence, I think it is the most likely source of life on this planet but that is only my opinion. The Big Bang has a great amount of evidence supporting it and it is in the realm of possiblity according to current models that it did pop out of nothing, but once again not enough evidence to conclude what came before it (OK, actually no evidence). \n\n \n An interesting thing about my Psycology textbook is that while it says evolution is a generally supported theory, one trait of a true scientist is the willingness to tolerate uncertainty. Therefore, evolution, or any other theory cannot be a given thing or fact. \n \n The fossil record shows that, during relativley short periods of time, very large numbers of species apperared, followed by longer 'lulls'. It seems to me that this would support a creationist beleif that God was creating new species at the beginning of a new 'day'(or age). It seems to me that this would be less supportive of evolution, which requires very long periods of time to be occur.\n \n I agree with the 'Big-Bang' theory. (maybe this is more because it gives evolution little time to have occured therefore supporting my own bias, but hey) The following might not be perfectly exact.... When Einstien found that his formula for gravity predicted our universe would start from a singularity, expand, and eventually squish, he didn't like it. It meant that the universe could not have existed forever... or at least so long that he wouldn't have to worry about a beginning. So he made up a variable that said once two things were far enough apart gravity would reverse... therefore making it possible for the universe to have continually expanded for a near infininite time before we appeared on the scene. (thus making evolution feasible) He later called this the greatest mistake of his career. Now, as you said, the Big-Bang theory is very much supported. It says our universe began, expanded, and will squish. It also says that the universe is about 15 billion years old. This is not much time for evolution, which is why Einstien didn't want to beleive it.\n \n \n...DNA is subject to mutation, we have seen beneficial mutations arise. That's all evolution needs. \n\n \n Evolution also needs a lot of time, because beneficial mutations are so very rare the mutation rate has to be slow... so that the bad mutations won't pile up before natural selection 'deselects' them. If the mutation rate is too fast, everything deteriorates until they die. \n \n \nI would think that since we see all grades of eyes in the world of nature from simple spots of photosensitive chemicals to the highly refined vision of the hawk, the eye can not possibly be Irreducibly complex. We see all the levels, we can see how the eye got more complex, we can deduce what mutations and changes were needed to make it more complex. After all, if we see simpler eyes occurring in nature, how can you say that any eye can not made even simpler? \n\n \n I don't know enough to effectively argue this, so I concede the point. If anyone else can, please do. \n \n \n What I'm saying is that intellgent humans haven't figured it out, creative beings can't match it, so it is more likely that it was done by a superintelligent and creative being than random forces, natural selection, and mutations.  \n \n But are you claiming that humans have figured out everything yet? I don't accept your point that just because we haven't figured it out YET, God had to do it. That is what the God of the gaps arguement is! If we don't understand it, must have been God! Why is it more likely that a supernatural being who we have no evidence even exists, sidestepped the natural laws He had to have set up and popped life into existance?\n We have seen complex organic molecules form, true we haven't seen life form yet and I can't discount the possiblity that God (or some other supernatural entity) did create that first life, but I find it much more likely it formed on it's own in accord with the natural world. And we have seen mutation and natural selection in action in the natural world. \n\n \n I'm NOT saying 'God did it'. I'm saying that it is more LIKELY for God to have done it!!!\n \n \n And who said Christianity is anti science? Not me! Many Christians are scientists and very good scientists. It's the fundamental creationists I have a problem with. The people who deny the TOE and spout that nonsense about a 6 day creation 6000 years ago, I consider them anti science. \n\n \n I apologize for having assumed you meant Christianity is anti-science. It was the impression I got, though. You certainly are not cautious in your condemnations.\n \n \n we were talking about evolutionary pathways for specific organs and systems, that's why I said 'plausible', not evolution as a whole but evolution is a fact, it does happen. This web site covers many of the objections you've made, if you have a chance, take a look at it and we can discuss any of the points you have a problme with:\n http://www.skeptictank.org/hs/factfaq.htm \n\n \n Hilarious website!! I enjoyed very much, except when it was so vehemently attacking and generalizing creationists. I didn't find it all that convincing though. Actually, it mostly just asserted that it was right - although it was informative in it's description of various theory's of evolution. I don't have much else to say but this bit...\n \n point 13 - evolution is not atheistic.... No, but it often accepted by atheists who want confirmation of their beliefs... therefore it is influenced by atheism.\n \n 20. is not dependent on the supernatural,\n \n In fact, must exclude itself from this realm. Evolution, as all science, must depend on exactly less than one miracle. No God(s) required nor desired. \n \n .... I disagree with this point because it basically implies that if scientific evidence pointed to creation it would not be scientific.\n \n 21. does not claim that \"Man came from apes\",... This point goes on to state that Humans and apes came from a common ancestor. The statement that 'Man came from apes' seems more plausible than 'Man came from one single-celled bactiria' - which would be much more accurate - so it isn't a straw-man. The point is that Macroevolution says 'Man is decended from something that was a different species' (kind of wordy, but accurate) That is the point. And it is true. So 'Man came from apes' really represents a non-significant misunderstanding of Macroevolution.\n \n \n \nyes new species are arriving all the time, evolution is an ongoing process. Are they keeping up with the number of species going extinct? i don't know, I can see man destroying so many environments as a factor but I just don't know the answer to that. How would this be a problem with evolution?\n\n \n New species are not arriving all the time. First, it would be all over the news. Second, the sum of examples in that funny site was probably not over 10. Extinction is occuring at rates between 1 per day to numbers like 1 per hour or more. My point was that the current number of species would not be explained if extinction outstrips speciation so badly. However... it is likely that the effect of humans causes a majority of the extinctions. Also, since we have existed for such a short period of time, speciation rates and extinction rates cannot be reasonably extrapolated to all of history.(assuming speciation does occur) I knew that my arguement was poor, but I kind of ignored that for the sake of saying something, and mostly since I was in a rather emotional state after you continued to repeat 'evolution is fact' as your sole arguement. \n \n Lets define some parameters here... evolution - meaning the change of frequency of alleles in a population over time - certainly does happen. It is even described in the Bible... when a population of sheep became more spotted and speckled over time. This seems to me a very obvious point. I'm talking about evolution - meaning the idea that simple, one-celled bacteria became us through macroevolution. When I say evolution, that is what I mean. If I want to include abiogenisis, I will call it Atheistic Evolution.",

Mutations are almost without exception neutral.\n \nWhat the point implied was that if we found that, say, the speed at which evolutionary change can happen was clearly insufficient to explain population explosions - thus reasonably refuting the TOE(I like that acronym)... and therefore pointing towards the probablity of a superintellent(God) to explain life... it would be unscientific because it requires God.\n\n But the \"speed\" of evolutionary change isn't insufficient as far as I know. What \"population explosions\" are you talking about? Just more babble, I presume. And even if you were able to refute the theory of evolution, that doesn't make your sky-man magic more probable. Either you superstitious mythology can stand on its own or it is worthless. So far you haven't presented any evidence to support your side, in spite of being asked many times. There are volumes of evidence that support evolution while there is none that supports your mythology.\n \nOf all the mutations occurring in man today, which are the ones that are best suited for survival?\n\n There are several mutations that offer immunity to malaria. Those have been very successful. But of course, only an idiot would think that a given mutation is universally beneficial. All of them depend on the environment. There is also a mutation that offers an immunity to the HIV virus. That is an extremely beneficial mutation when you consider that AIDS is a heterosexual disease everywhere but in the U.S. Another is the mutation that supresses the wisdom teeth. Until quite recently impacted wisdom teeth were quite serious. Even with successful surgery, it was possible to die from infection. It still is since bacteria have evolved to become resistant to most antibiotics. It is actually possible to die from a minor cut on the finger that becomes infected.\n \n But of course, your question is basically silly. It shows a lack of basic understanding as well as a lack of thought. If I have a mutation that makes me immune to malaria, I am not likely to be aware of that. If I am immune to AIDS, how would I know? Every person has between 10 and 100 mutations. If your claims are true, the population should be going down rapidly.\n \nI will certainly agree that a majority of scientists support evolution. But, what do you mean there is no valid arguement against it? Would a scientific argument against it be invalid? No.\n\n No, a scientific argument against the theory of evolution would not be invalid. The thing is that there are no scientific arguments against the theory of evolution. That's what he means when he says that there are no valid arguments against it.\n \n So are you going to present some evidence to support your \"theory\" (that means primative mythology in this context) of creation? Either your \"theory\" can stand on its own or it is non-existant.",

If your claims are true, the population should be going down rapidly.\n \n\n \n So the only way to tell for instance that 'survival of the fittest' is at work is to look backwards and say, 'well if this critter survived it must be because of evolution'\n \n \"In the broadest sense, evolution is merely change, and so is all-pervasive; galaxies, languages, and political systems all evolve. Biological evolution ... is change in the properties of populations of organisms that transcend the lifetime of a single individual. The ontogeny of an individual is not considered evolution; individual organisms do not evolve. The changes in populations that are considered evolutionary are those that are inheritable via the genetic material from one generation to the next. Biological evolution may be slight or substantial; it embraces everything from slight changes in the proportion of different alleles within a population (such as those determining blood types) to the successive alterations that led from the earliest protoorganism to snails, bees, giraffes, and dandelions.\" - Douglas J. Futuyma in Evolutionary Biology, Sinauer Associates 1986 \n quoted at http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html\n \n So allele changes may be in the broadest sense proof of evolution... because evolution can be any biological change.\n \n Therefore, you could say that because I am different from my parents, it's evolution! Wowee! This is so easy!\n \n Or they may just be 'differentiation' within a species.\n \n If you could say \"x change of allele will lead to survival of this species', and then observe that species surviving then you could say it's 'observed'\n \n In fact, how do you know that allele changes have always occurred?\n \n What is 'natural selection' anyway?\n \"Natural selection occurs when the viability of an allele is tested in real life. It makes only one test. Contrary to popular opinion, evolution does not select the fittest, strongest, or most superior organism. It is instead a question of how many offspring the organism will have which in turn will reach sufficient maturity to have its own offspring. If the effect is positive, the allele will become a permanent part of the gene pool. If the effect is very successful, it will quickly become a dominant allele. If the effect is neutral or negative, the allele will not spread rapidly through the gene pool and, usually, will disappear from the gene pool. If more than one mutation is being tested at the same time, usually the case, then it is the summed effect tested. Not all good mutations make it. Some mutations would be good at one time and bad at another, depending on the environment then. A mutation that was necessary at one time may become unnecessary at another time and be consequently negated. Most of the time, the alleles removed or negated are those that harm the organism in that environment. Natural selection removes variability from the gene pool.\"\n http://www.onelife.com/evolve/evolution.html\n \n Why is variability removed?\n In fact this suggests the opposite...\n \" Before a gene can mutate, it must exist. The results of all mutations are a varied form (allele) of an already existing gene, which is the variation within created kinds that is expected in the creation model. The number of defects in human beings that are the result of genetic mutations is increasing with time, which is exactly what is expected in the creation model in which created kinds started with flawless genes that continue to degrade over time.

For example, in the Oxford Concise Science Dictionary we find the following definition: \n \"evolution: The gradual process by which the present diversity of plant and animal life arose from the earliest and most primitive organisms, which is believed to have been continuing for the past 3000 million years.\" \n This is inexcusable for a dictionary of science.

It is because of rapidly expanding technology that we are now able to relatively easily discover genetic links ot many diseases, most of which were previously considered to be caused by other things.\n \n In other words, it is not that the number of genetic-related disorders is growing, it is just that we are identifying more and more disorders as such.

All I have to do is what ive already done; that is, show that the component parts have a selectable function outside the system itself.\n \n That being said, and because im not here to do all your homework for you, i'll give you *a* intermediate step for the cilium. Cavalier-Smith has shown that a non-swimming appendage made of microtubules can, by increasing surface area, help the protozoan remain suspended in water, among other things. This selectable function is hardly idle speculation, because some organisms with analogous anatomical features do the same thing, and find it quite useful.\n \n -GFA\n\n \n I still don't see that the IC arguement is refuted.

First, the recognizer gene and its binding sites co-evolve, so they become dependent on each other and destructive mutations in either immediately lead to elimination of the organism. This situation fits Behe's [34] definition of `irreducible complexity' exactly (``a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning'', page 39), yet the molecular evolution of this `Roman arch' is straightforward and rapid, in direct contradiction to his thesis.\"\n \n \n\"2. These components were coopted and combined to serve new purposes, one at a time.\"\n \n So there actually is a function for 2 parts of the rotor by themselves? How do the components get mixed and matched?\n\n \n That's the idea.\n \n The thing with aspects of organisms is that they often can serve more than one purpose. If you have two different componets that evolve separately, when placed together, they can also begin to serve a third purpose when they are together due to their interactions with eachother. In the case of \"apparent\" IC, the original functions of the two independent elements can become superfluous and disappear, leaving the combined system which now appears to be irreducibly complex. You can not subtract any parts to the system now without making it non function. Of course the trick is that you actually have to \"add\" the now missing bits to get back to the original two reducible components.\n \n This is the \"roman arch\" evolutionary pathway for irreducible complexity to evolve.\n \n \nIn Nutrition, I'm learning about protiens. (like insulin, and hemoglobin) They are 100's to 100's of thousands of amino acids \"blocks\" long. If they are missing just a few(for instance, if 10% were missing - there would be no hope in the world for it to function), the protien is not shaped right and can't be used. How does this evolve step by step?\n\n \n Again.. it's really that \"if any bits are missing\" that it won't work. The original molecule may have actually had 10% ---MORE--- amino acids than the present molecule, not less. The 10% that is missing allowed the two halfs of the molecule to perform two other independent functions previously. \n \n This is the blunder that Behe makes. He doesn't take into account the fact that the present molecule may be smaller than previous molecules. \n The roman arch method of evolving IC is not about adding each block from the base of the arch, its building an arch from the ground up, then removing the center.\n \n For example.. lets say the original insulin molecule was a product of the combination of two slightly different somewhat simpler molecules which originally performed two other functions. When combined together, they act as insulin. But the original extra bits of the combined molecule (originally used for the previous two separate functions) are no longer needed. \n \n What you're left scratching your head over is how the molecule came together all at once when any part of it is taken away. But once you realize bits can be removed as well as added, it's no longer much of a mystery.\n \n Behe and the ID proponents count on the common laymen simply not being aware of any of this.

At any given point, if you have a protein with 5 amino acids, and you add another to make 6, it only \"counts\" if that new acid aids in the survival of the organism. Otherwise that amino acid (and the organism that has it) is discarded. This is how, step by step, you go from 4, to 5, to 6, to seven amino acids in sequence.\n \n And as I've described above, it only takes two 20 amino acid protiens, which when combined together serve a new purpose, to in one fell swoop make a new 40 amino acid protein.\n \n Now in the case of pre-cellular evolution, we're talking chemical metabolisms, not proteins. A system of independent interacting molecules which form a small replicating system.\n \n One suggestion that seems to have merit is the thioester metabolism, as it is fairly simple, and also exists as a fundamental aspect of cellular energy production.\n \n In any case, as far as abiogenesis is concerned, denial of the possibility is merely an argument from incredulity.

However, if you have any specific criticisms of these simulations (avida, or the co-evolution simulation), then feel free to point them out. \n\n \n Well, I'm really quite ignorant as for as genetics and computers go, but... One problem I think I could point out is that there was no possiblitly for recessive mutations. Only the positive mutations were passed on in each generation. While I think this would hold true as far as dominant mutations, 'bad' recessive genes are actually the majority of mutations which have an effect. These would be passed on, and never be selected against unless two copies were combined in a particular organism. Indeed, there seems to be no way of selecting against single, recessive genes. As an aside, I think I will venture that creation theory would predict a build up of 'bad' mutations while evolution theory should predict a build up of 'good' mutations over time. \n \n \"The number of harmful mutations that arise in each generation has been measured, and it is surprisingly high. 4.2 mutations per person per generation.\" (James F. Crow, Nature, Jan. 28, 1999, p. 232, 293-294) \"About 38% are estimated to have been eliminated by natural selection... indicating that the rate specific to protein - coding sequences is nearly to the upper tolerable limit.\" (Adam Eyre-Walker, Peter D Keightley, High genomic deleterious mutation rates in hominids Nature, Jan. 28, 1999, p. 344-347).\n \n So the simulation completely ignores recessive mutations. How can we be evolving if the average person gets about 3 bad mutations passed on per generation?\n \n \nMistakes are constantly being introduced in coding genes which cause novel combinations of preexisting proteins. If you have two independent proteins with shapes which fold to perform two different unrelated functions, and who have a significant likelyhood of being recombined into another third useful molecule.. it will occur.\n \n If this third molecule now provides a different function, the superflous bits of the original two proteins will be pruned, leaving what appears to be an irreducibly complex single protein which is larger than the two originals, but which no part can be removed.\n\n \n How do these mistakes work?

It is called \"the RNA world,\" and the claim is now that the first living cell, from which we supposedly evolved, was started by RNA instead of protein. Nucleotides, we are told, linked together to form chains of RNA which brought about the first life. The schoolbooks I have checked fail to mention the fact that RNA, like protein, does not form anywhere in nature except in already living cells. Neither do the nucleotides from which RNA is made. Here it is from a philosopher of science:\n \n \"Though a few organic substances-for instance, certain simple amino acids-can form relatively easily under prebiotic conditions, other biochemical building blocks, such as nucleotides and lipids, require for their synthesis a 'real factory.'\"2 Since nucleotides which are the building blocks of RNA and DNA do not form spontaneously, neither do RNA and DNA. In fact, RNA and DNA can't even be made in the laboratory 3 \"\n \n http://www.creationism.org/heinze/FirstLife01Overview.htm\n \n So, if RNA has not been made on purpose in labs, why should it have spontaneously generated by chance?\n \n \nYes.. without natural selection, you don't have evolution.. you have random chance. Good thing evolution is a combination of both.\n \n As far as your calculations of probability, let me give you an example. If I asked you to roll a dice 100 times, and roll a \"six\" every time, what would the likelyhood of this occuring be?\n \n On the other hand, if I told you to roll the dice, but only count the rolls where you do roll a six, it would be trivial for you to roll 100 sixes (as every other roll would just be discarded).\n \n This is how evolution works. At any given point, if you have a protein with 5 amino acids, and you add another to make 6, it only \"counts\" if that new acid aids in the survival of the organism. Otherwise that amino acid (and the organism that has it) is discarded. This is how, step by step, you go from 4, to 5, to 6, to seven amino acids in sequence.\n\n \n The probablity was for abiogenesis. There is no natural selection in abiogenesis. So the probability was valid unless you can show me a different probablility or a different problem with it. \n \n \n Now in the case of pre-cellular evolution, we're talking chemical metabolisms, not proteins. A system of independent interacting molecules which form a small replicating system.\n \n One suggestion that seems to have merit is the thioester metabolism, as it is fairly simple, and also exists as a fundamental aspect of cellular energy production.\n \n In any case, as far as abiogenesis is concerned, denial of the possibility is merely an argument from incredulity. This might make sense if it was considered without the overwhelming evidence for evolution from simple cellular life onwards. However, it's almost impossible to ignore the fact that the entire body of evidence for evolution creates a giant arrow, who's tip points squarely to abiogenesis.\n\n \n Evolution theory says it proceeds by natural selection. Abiogenesis does not. They are really quite different. It has been stated by others in these forums that evolution says nothing about abiogenesis. I think that they are separate theorys - although both are involved in our beginnings. How is it 'merely an argument from incredulity' to say that, if the probablity of abiogenesis of an extremely simple cell is 1 in 10^5700 or any where near that that it shouldn't be accepted as reasonable?",

   "If you want an example of Macroevolution, just look at how much animals have changed based on the number of them that could have been on Noah's ark.\n\n \n Do you think that much diversity could have happened by Macro-evolution in the roughly 5000 years since the Flood? It is my understanding that Macro-evolution must occur very gradually.\n \n I've been reading at www.creationism.org and I now see a difference between micro and macro evolution. Micro-evolution and macro-evolution occur through different processes. Micro-e is the change of allele frequencies through generations. In an example like the peppered moth, the white moths outnumbered the dark ones by 95%, I believe, until the environment got polluted. Then the dark ones increased in frequency. After environmental cleaning the frequencies returned to their former state. \n \n If, say, the dark ones had been wiped out, the population would have had an actual elimination of an allele. At first, it would seem like macro-e but it actually represents a loss in information and a reduction in the ability of the population to survive changing conditions.\n \n The point is that allele-frequency change cannot 'add up' to big changes. It only shuffles between existing info and may eliminate some as well. Macro-e must 'progress' by mutations of the existing information. But then there is the combination theory which Rationalist has explained. I think it is intriuguing, but I don't see how the different protiens become combined, nor do I see that there is a good likely-hood of them being useful if accidentaly combined - but there's always the billions of years which evolution must rely on in which anything is possible!\n \n *edit* A seeming change in diversity of animals since the flood could be explained by allele changes. For example, dog breeding has resulted in such different breeds as a Chiuaua(however you spell it) and a Great Dane. This has not been through mutation, but by such things as the elimination of 'big' genes in the Chiuaua and the elimination of 'small' genes in the Dane. So it would seem that there may have been only one breed of 'dog' on the Ark - something like a wolf I suppose - and that breed has diversified due to different allele frequencies being caused by different environments.

Even using the family, he has to put the larger animals in as what he calls juveniles, which is about 75% of the total space used for the animals. This raises all kinds of questions in itself but I won't diverge at this point. However I will point out that if you break the division of animals on the ark down to species, it's an easy task to show the impossibility of getting that many animals on the ark. This leaves either the kind being the family with rapid evolution afterwards or too many animals to fit. My brain says something has to give.",

You can't provide this evidence because it is quite common.\n \n The prevalence of deconstructable apparent IC systems is an achillies heel to IC in general. It clearly demonstrates that if molecule \"A\" appears to be IC, but in fact has a variety of precursors.. then it is unlikely that \"B\" which is presently unknown does not as well.\n \n \n\n Be positive. Show me the pathway of step-by-step evolution that lead to the flagella.\n\n \n If I show you how the flagella evolved stepwise, then you will abandon creationism right? After all, it seems that if we can just identify the evolutionary history of any given IC system, creationists will then give up on IC for good. \n \n Be honest now. Even if the flagella were described, you would then dig around to try and find some other supposed IC system, and cling to that until that too was understood. This has been happening ever since the eye or heart was proposed as IC. Each were not, but that never stopped the creationists.\n \n Okay..\n \n http://www.health.adelaide.edu.au/Pharm/Musgrave/essays/flagella.htm\n \n \n\"A possible scenario for the evolution of the eubacterial flagella is as follows: a secretory system arose first, based around the SMC rod pore forming complex, which was the common ancestor of the type III secretory system, and the flagellar system.\n \n The proto-flagellar filament arose next as part of the protein secretion structure (cf the Pseudomonas pilus, the Salmonella filamentous apendages and the E coli filamentous structures), finally (as suggested by the presence of at least two, if not three, indpendent motors) an ion pump which was doing something else [see note] became associated with this structure and motility (presumably weak) occured fortuitosly. Even today MotAB can freely dissociate and re-associate with the flagellar structure. This early, limited motility was later refined into the more compentent system we see today. Alternatively, the ion pumps became linked to the proto-flagella to provide extra \"power\" to pump proteins out of the complex, and flagella motion occured via fortuitous mutations in the linkers Fli G,N,M later on. Regulation and switching can be added on later as there are modern eubacteria that lack these and function well in their environments.\n\n \n This scenario coopts preexisting homologous secretion strutures with similar shapes, and produces a primitive pre-flagella with limited motility. \n \n This is the type of recombination of existing structures evolved for different purposes that is typically the source of IC systems. The homology of the secretion protein structure and the secretion system is seen as good evidence that this was the case in this instance.\n \n \nQuote:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Originally Posted by Rationalist\n No, each combination is useful alone. But changes to those working systems can be useful in new ways.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Show me the steps But before you do, you might like to see a response to Miller (who has already tried to do this) at\n http://www.theism.net/article/39\n \n Three times you've said it. I could be cruel and quote back at you your own words \"An unsupported claim\" but I'm interested in dialogue.\n\n \n In this case I made no claims.. I made a reasoned argument. The argument demonstrates a pathway by which IC can arise even though the \"removal\" of any of the components of the system cause it to no longer function. \n \n The evidence for the separate claim that such is the case in the natural world is common enough. \n \n \nStep-by-step evolution has not been shown to lead to a flagellum!

By coming up with any number of countless hypotheticals, you will ensure the exhausting of argument as the onus of proof will always be on my side. I'd have to continually try to prove negatives.\n\n \n \nNo, you simply have to provide evidence that such has never, or rarely been noted to occur. You can't provide this evidence because it is quite common.\n The prevalence of deconstructable apparent IC systems is an achillies heel to IC in general. It clearly demonstrates that if molecule \"A\" appears to be IC, but in fact has a variety of precursors.. then it is unlikely that \"B\" which is presently unknown does not as well.\n\n \n When you say \"You can't provide this evidence because it is quite common\" I've no idea what you are referring to. Behe says that the flagella can't be drawn together piece by piece... because it wouldn't work with parts missing. It would serve as a hindrance to the creature, not a help, the same as if you had a 12foot piece of skin hanging off the end of your nose. (Sure, one day it might in theory be part of a trunk).\n \n \"...as biochemists have begun to examine apparently simple structures like cilia and flagella, they have discovered staggering complexity, with dozens or even hundreds of precisely tailored parts. It is very likely that many of the parts we have not considered here are required for any cilium to function in a cell. As the number of required parts increases, the difficulty of gradually putting the system together skyrockets, and the likelihood of indirect scenarios plummets. Darwin looks more and more forlorn.\"\n http://www.windowview.org/ARNfiles/Flagellum.html\n \n \nBe positive. Show me the pathway of step-by-step evolution that lead to the flagella.\n\n \n \nIf I show you how the flagella evolved stepwise, then you will abandon creationism right? After all, it seems that if we can just identify the evolutionary history of any given IC system, creationists will then give up on IC for good. \n Be honest now. Even if the flagella were described, you would then dig around to try and find some other supposed IC system, and cling to that until that too was understood. This has been happening ever since the eye or heart was proposed as IC. Each were not, but that never stopped the creationists.\n\n \n As I said, you are being dogmatic. This unfair rhetorical ploy has no basis in an argument other than to confirm that you are already biased.\n \n There are a number of problems with your arguments.\n \n 1) if you could show flagella was not IC, that would not disprove the IC concept, only this example\n 2) the statement you made could be turned on you... If I show you that the flagella is indeed IC, then you will abandon evolutionary theory right? (see how it doesn't work as an argument)\n \n \nOkay..\n http://www.health.adelaide.edu.au/P...ys/flagella.htmQuote:\n \"A possible scenario for the evolution of the eubacterial flagella is as follows: a secretory system arose first, based around the SMC rod pore forming complex, which was the common ancestor of the type III secretory system, and the flagellar system.\n The proto-flagellar filament arose next as part of the protein secretion structure (cf the Pseudomonas pilus, the Salmonella filamentous appendages and the E coli filamentous structures), finally (as suggested by the presence of at least two, if not three, independent motors) an ion pump which was doing something else [see note] became associated with this structure and motility (presumably weak) occurred fortuitously. Even today MotAB can freely dissociate and re-associate with the flagellar structure. This early, limited motility was later refined into the more competent system we see today. Alternatively, the ion pumps became linked to the proto-flagella to provide extra \"power\" to pump proteins out of the complex, and flagella motion occurred via fortuitous mutations in the linkers Fli G,N,M later on. Regulation and switching can be added on later as there are modern eubacteria that lack these and function well in their environments.\n \n This scenario coopts pre-existing homologous secretion structures with similar shapes, and produces a primitive pre-flagella with limited motility. \n This is the type of recombination of existing structures evolved for different purposes that is typically the source of IC systems. The homology of the secretion protein structure and the secretion system is seen as good evidence that this was the case in this instance.\n\n (there were so many spelling errors in this I doubt the person's competence, however...)\n \n Are you saying this is how it happened? No, you're saying this is how it might have happened. Your argument (the site you cite) takes the independent protein approach. But could it really have happened?\n \n \"Miller asserted that the flagellum is not irreducibly complex because some proteins of the flagellum could be missing and the remainder could still transport proteins, perhaps independently. (Proteins similar -- but not identical -- to some found in the flagellum occur in the type III secretory system of some bacteria. See Hueck 1998). Again he was equivocating, switching the focus from the function of the system to act as a rotary propulsion machine to the ability of a subset of the system to transport proteins across a membrane. However, taking away the parts of the flagellum certainly destroys the ability of the system to act as a rotary propulsion machine, as I have argued. Thus, contra Miller, the flagellum is indeed irreducibly complex. What's more, the function of transporting proteins has as little directly to do with the function of rotary propulsion as a toothpick has to do with a mousetrap. So discovering the supportive function of transporting proteins tells us precisely nothing about how Darwinian processes might have put together a rotary propulsion machine.\"\n \n To this let me add: A system is irreducibly complex in Behe's sense if all its parts are indispensable to preserving the system's basic function. That an irreducibly complex system may have subsystems that have functions of their own (functions distinct from that of the original system) is therefore allowed in the definition. It seems that Miller is unclear about the distinction between a definition and an argument. Irreducible complexity is a well-defined notion that is appropriately and ascertainably applied to the bacterial flagellum. Miller's concern ultimately seems not over the definition but over its use as an argument to rebut Darwinism. Miller's point here generally is that if subsystems can be found with functions of their own (perforce different from that of the original system since otherwise the original system would not be irreducibly complex), then those subsystems and their functions can be grist for selection's mill and underwrite a Darwinian account of how the original system arose. Let's now turn to that possibility.\"\n \n \"Miller's whole argument that the bacterial flagellum evolved by Darwinian means rests on the existence of the type III secretory system (TTSS). The TTSS is coded for by about ten genes, each of which is homologous to genes in the bacterial flagellum. Thus Miller sees the TTSS as embedded in the bacterial flagellum, capable of being selected for on its own, and as a possible evolutionary precursor to the flagellum. He writes: \"The TTSS does not tell us how either it or the flagellum evolved. This is certainly true, although Aizawa has suggested that the TTSS may indeed be an evolutionary precursor of the flagellum (Aizawa 2001).\"\n \n \"Accordingly, the TTSS may be thought of as a possible subsystem of the flagellum that performs a function distinct from the flagellum. Nevertheless, finding a subsystem of a functional system that performs some other function is hardly an argument for the original system evolving from that other system. One might just as well say that because the motor of a motorcycle can be used as a blender, therefore the motor evolved into the motorcycle. Perhaps, but not without intelligent design. Indeed, multipart, tightly integrated functional systems almost invariably contain multipart subsystems that serve some different function. At best the TTSS represents one possible step in the indirect Darwinian evolution of the bacterial flagellum. But that still wouldn't constitute a solution to the evolution of the bacterial flagellum. What's needed is a complete evolutionary path and not merely a possible oasis along the way. To claim otherwise is like saying we can travel by foot from Los Angeles to Tokyo because we've discovered the Hawaiian Islands. Evolutionary biology needs to do better than that.\"\n http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.02.Miller_Response.htm\n \n I did suggest you read before you responded.",

I don't think you understand IC at all, because you are reducing something to a non-working state and therefore claiming that this debunks IC... such as talking about independent proteins. The flagella is not a protein, it is a system that needs all the component parts to work. It doesn't matter an iota if a protein within that system can exist by itself.\n\n \n Well... the mouse trap that behe presents is reducibly complex, as is the bacterial flagella. Do you have more examples?\n \n As far as you're separate proteins, the proteins perform a function at every point. When they are separated, they are part of the secretory system. It is only when they have a small amount of motility when combined together that they are coopted for locomotion instead.

This unfair rhetorical ploy has no basis in an argument other than to confirm that you are already biased.\n\n \n No, I'm just asking whether you are.\n \n And yes, I am biased in the sense that based on experience, I don't believe that showing the steps in the evolution of any claimed IC system ever changes any creationists mind. Even if we can plausibly explain 99.9% of all evolved systems by showing functional precursor.. there will always be something left unexplained.\n \n But again, the problem with IC is not with this or that unexplained anatomical or molecular system.. it's with the reasoning itself. Apparent IC is formed often by the removal of pieces from a system, meaning a system can evolve step by step by \"both\" adding and removing parts to the system. If you ignore adding back in parts, you've made a fundamental error.\n \n \nThere are a number of problems with your arguments.\n \n 1) if you could show flagella was not IC, that would not disprove the IC concept, only this example.\n\n \n No, the proof that IC is flawed is in its blatant errors in reasoning.

They're trivial to refute, as they were immediately by almost all competent biologists when he published his book. These refutations are the same ones I've posted. I've simply paraphrased them here.\n \n You switch from defending the logic behind IC, which is fundamentally flawed, to trying to claim that this or that system or function must be IC because we don't know how it evolved.\n \n But if the basic premises of behe's IC are broken, simply claiming that we don't know how this thing or that thing evolved can't fix them.\n \n \n(there were so many spelling errors in this I doubt the person's competence, however...)\n\n \n The misspellings are in my portion.

So, we should be getting masses of differences all the time. The baby example sounds absurd to you, but why should it be absurd? Shouldn't nature keep throwing up freakish things?\n\n \n It does. Saltational mutations make up the bulk of grotesque deformities in all species.\n \n However, you always will have natural selection to contend with. Arms growing out of heads, and eight fingers are rarely beneficial.\n \n \nAs I said, we should be seeing hundreds of thousands of these things all over the world, humans here there and everywhere getting a third ear or a extra long nose.\n\n \n We do see these things, but again, saltational mutations almost always detrimental. \n \n In computer simulations of evolution we see why. Evolution accretes complexity. The early major steps form the base of later evolved systems, and future changes evolve to work with these earlier systems. When a random change is made to one of the earlier evolved systems, it typically causes major problems for the rest.\n \n This is why human beings can't \"backwards\" evolve .. say .. radial symmetry, or eight arms. These sudden changes cause serious problems to the rest of the body because of all the other mutations that have evolved expecting 2 arms and bilateral symmetry.\n \n On the other hand, mutaions which lead to a lengthening of the arm, or thickening of the hair, color change, etc. are more common. This is the typical grist of evolution.\n \n So.. what does saltational mutations have to do with IC again anyway?\n \n \nOriginally Posted by Montalban\n The flagella has parts that are unique to it.

Secondly, mutations are caused by radiation, chemicals, and a whole host of other items. Cosmic radiation is present in almost all places on the planet. You have to go very very deep inside the earth to eliminate them. It doesn't take much. More makes it happen more readily but a little can cause it as well. \n \n As I said though, Chemicals can cause it as can radiation, as can simple spontaneity and the codons themselves can actually code for a mutation to occur. A DNA switch can switch on a gene that actually codes for enzymes that code for the mutations.\n \n Also mutation can occur at the RNA level. Mrna could be coded incorrectly, tRNA could malfunction, rRNA could also code incorrectly and produce an enzyme (read protein) that causes a mutation in one of the sex cells or otherwise.\n \n Genetic mutations or alterations can occur macroscopically or even what are called point mutations where there is a singualr change in one nucleic acid. In DNA replication a nucleic acid can be missed entirely shifting all of the nucleic acids one down in the chain. This has catastrophic consequences usually.

Therefore, they do not have the best answers and when they do come up with something interesting it is easily refuted.\n \n Your third point: If Lurch does not hold a PhD he probably should.\n \n I went to a state university to study evolution with the sole purpose of refuting it. I do not have all the answers, but I am willing to do the research if you post some responses here. I am the only student who went in a Christian believing in 6 days of creation and went out the same way.\n \n The main problem is you are trying to convert the members of one religion (forgive me lurch but if you look up the definition you will see I can use it here) to another. I believe Christians should rename what we call science and avoid the stuff completely. Why? By definition, science discovers things through hypothesis. This is why you can never scientifically prove creation. You cannot form a hypothesis about the supernatural. It is in the scientific rulebook. God is supernatural so you cannot form a hypothesis about him. You cannot form a hypothesis unless you can test it. God clearly says we are not to test him so any hypothesis about God is not valid (strike two). Finally, You can only form hypothesis about things you can disprove. Well, God exists so you cannot disprove him so once again science has blocked us from proving to them His existence. You cannot convert someone from his or her religion.\n \n You ask for proof of the Bible. Something is deemed historically correct if it can be verified by more than one source. With the gospels and Josephus Jesus would be historically correct. Kings and Chronicles are two sources, which describe what happened to the tribe of Judah. What about the flood? Well, funny that every single culture on the face of this earth has a worldwide flood story. Yes, these stories have slight variation as do Chronicles and Kings and as do Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. However, if you handed in a paper to a teacher that was word for word the same between you and four of your friends she would not think it was your own work. Their variation proves different authorship.\n \n Science began with Socrates, who denied the existence of all the Greek gods, but accepted the existence of one God because he realized that bicycles (I am using bicycles as an example do not e-mail me to say they didn't have bicycles in ancient Greece!) do not just form themselves. To get a tool to do such a precise activity it must be designed. He deemed that since all of nature had a precise job it was to accomplish it could not have just formed. However, his contemporary philosophers (which is where our modern science evolved from) could only see the ridiculousness of their polytheistic mythology and began to deny that any god existed.",

   "The \"evidence\" is a document that is not supported by objective evidence, and in actually suggests things that observations of the real world contradict. If you start with the assumption that the bible is correct, and then interpret the objective evidence found in the real world to fit what the bible says, and then insist this shows support of the bible... this is circular logic. \n \n Science tries to describe the natural world, or describe the world with regards to what can be objectively observed. that's fine if you want to say that there are things beyond the natural world, however you can't suggest that science should acknowledge their existence because they are simply out of the scope of science.\n\n \n \n \n This is good. I like this. You say that science does not presume anything beforehand. Yet they have to in order to form a hypothesis, a scientist must have some presumptions. \n Now lets review a little history. I will be brief and only give three examples. Lets start with DNA. Hmmm, in the beginning (fifty years agoish) scientist had a longstanding hypothesis. Proteins were the genetic material. Then some nice scientists came along and attached a marked to DNA and protein and clearly discovered with reproducible results that DNA was the genetic material. The scientific community refused their experiments until is could not longer be denied. Now with these prions, we have returned to the same question and science is trying to explain how proteins can alter a cell's genetics without being genetic material. \n Now lets take a more recent turn of events. The universe is expanding a constant rate. This has been documented and I believe it is even a scientific law. However. for the big bang to occur, it would have been impossible, so scientists are changing the law to say that in the beginning (excuse the wording) the universe expanded very quickly and then slowed shortly afterward to a constant speed that has never changed since.\n Finally, lets talk about evolution. What is the theory of evolution (not the vague \"things change over time without God\")? Well, originally it was things change slowly over a period of many billions of years. Sadly, the fossil record does not support this view. According to the record, things have a burst of diversification, then they have a dying off period, then a space and then another burst of diversification. Well, that is a bit harder to stomach than a nice slow one mutation at a time, one gene at a time theory, but eventually the evolutionists will have to explain it (if they haven't already come up with some good excuse) because they are certain that the theory of evolution is true. \n No, I am sorry, but scientists by nature jump to conclusions just as badly as &#8220;creationists&#8221; do.",

   "Science tries to explain physical events in terms of logical reasoning based on the evidence.

You are talking about minor changes.\n \n Now lets take a more recent turn of events. The universe is expanding a constant rate. This has been documented and I believe it is even a scientific law.

That&#8217;s fine for those that want to believe that, but it ain&#8217;t science.\n\n \n \n 1. No the present rate at which the universe is expanding is basically the same. Look up the Inflationary Theory which is the theory that I am referring to about how the universe spent the first fraction of a second expanding very quickly and then suddenly slowed. Whether or not the universe will continue to expand or will stop has not been determined yet. Once again, in this field their are many Theories that need to be formed to try and explain why the universe did this, and the scientists who support the big bang are trying to form them to explain how their idea is true. Not by looking at it without bias.\n 2. Sorry, as I stated earlier, I do not read much on creationist theories (unless I am looking to see how unscientific they are) only evolutionist ones actually written by evolutionists. Get a good book on the fossil record and you will see that this is a correct adjustment to the theory. (as I believe you are admitting). We find animals in the fossil record in groups of diversity. Then there is a period where we find little to no fossils. In high school, we learn about nice round circular orbits in which electrons float around the nucleus of an atom. In college, we learn this is not the truth, electrons are most likely in an orbital which are anything but perfect circles and only the predictable spots where we can expect the electrons at a given point in time. A pair of evolutionary scientists wrote the book I read, although I believe it was called \"The Myth of Evolution\" it had a deceiving title in that aspect. I got it at the public library which was a surprise to me because usually I have only found non-scholarly works there. Someone else in this post had pointed out that a person who is a scientist and believes in God goes about his experiments in such a way as to prove that he is right and this invalidates his work. The point I was making was not to disprove evolution based on these facts, but to say that an evolutionist forms his theories on the preconcieved notions that evolution is correct in the same way someone who believes in God bases his theories on the preconceived notions that he is correct. \n 3. I agree that science is subject to peer review. Its precision in some of its discoveries is part of why I love it. But science is not a constant. You are wrong to assume that a creationist can just say,\"God did it\" and that is an answer. It is true that people who believe in creation should have a blind faith, but a scientist examines the world and realizes that something must have created it. Based on his obsevations, he determines that through a series of chemical reactions the world was created. A creationist can look at the world and determine that although chemical reactions are carried out quite naturally, that there is something more than that driving nature and determines it to be God. A buddhist monk can be just a scientific and determine the same thing can be karma.\n The biggest problem is that evolution belongs on the philosophical end of the scientific spectrum. It is impossible to prove without a doubt who is right until, of course God returns, but the scientist and the buddhist both say that will not happen.",

   "No one wants to address the Noah's ark crowding problem I brought up?\n\n \n I will address your Noah's ark issue and a few others. The ark was about as big as a football stadium and contained three separate floors. Yes, they were on the ark for a little over a year. Even more shocking contrary to popular belief, they did not just take two of every kind. Some kinds they had to take seven pairs (fourteen animals) onto the ark. Therefore, as big as it was it does lead us to wonder how could they have done it and had enough food?\n A football stadium is relatively large, but with all those animals, it would have been crowded. However, some or the animals that were taken in seven pairs would have been food animals for the other animals. In addition, most large animals do not reproduce as quickly as smaller animals and so this would have helped as well. In addition, when God instructed Noah about \"kinds\" and \"animals\" it is probable that these terms were not all inclusive (in other words they did not mean every living species at the time of the flood). Before the flood, a mist covered the surface of the earth. I am sure it was thicker than what we find today in rainforests. All the animals God created to live in this environment would not have been able to survive after the flood so I am sure God did not have Noah waste space on the ark with them. \n In the recent past, we have discovered how to make many hybrids of animals and plants. Since humans are involved this in not evolution. Although Mendel was named the father of modern genetics, I believe that humans who were allowed to live for 700 - 900 years would have been able to come to some of their own discoveries. I also believe that after Noah exited the ark he and his sons were able to help speed the process of diversification. Once again since it was human controlled, it is not evolution.",

The scientific method is remorseless, presumptions that are not supported by the evidence are discarded, even presumptions that are well loved and accepted. Take creationism for example, up until about 200 years ago it was scientifically accepted that the earth was young and all life was discretely created. This was the mainstream scientific presumption, backed up by the Bible. But then Christian geologists started looking at the Earth, at quarries and excavation sites, at mountains and they realized that the layers in the geologic column couldn't have possibly been formed in a few thousand years, that the Earth had to be millions of years old at least. Notice the presuposition was a young earth, but the extrodinary evidence forced them to change their theory. The same goes for evolution. Darwin was a christian, his presupposition was not evolution, just the opposite. But the evidence forced him to change his view. In all the time between Darwin and now, all the evidence has confirmed his original hypothesis, all life evolved from a common ancestor. Discoveries of DNA and the fossil record only confirm this.

   "Ezekiel predicted Babylon would conquer Egypt and was wrong.As long as a flaw exists in the Bible it cannot be considered to be proof enough in itself and therefore is not reliable evidence for creation.\n\n \n \n Before responding specifically to these statements, I would like to address the consensus among the pro-evolutionists in this forum. They constantly relate repeatedly that the Bible is a book of complete fiction. It irks me to see people who are claiming to be educated not accept the Bible as a historical document. Aside from doing various other tests for authenticity and dating of artifacts (and translation which some also consider falling under the same category), science is not history and scientists are not historians. Historians recognize any written material from the past as important to decoding history. If you throw out the Bible as a historical document and consider it a fiction, then you must also throw out hieroglyphics, which historians recognize as history even though they have been proven to contain gross historical errors in favor of Egypt. In fact, since most of recorded history before the Common Era was lost, and historians rely on second hand sources such as Herodotus and Josephus to fill in the dark eras, you would also have to discount them. In effect, you might as well say that history never existed because it could not be effectively tested, which is about as unscientific a statement as can be. I am not asking for those involved here to accept the Bible as the divinely inspired Word of God and that every detail is accurate (regardless of what I believe). What I am saying is that you do not need to discredit every letter of it as being an inaccurate mythology story. This claim only shows you ignorance of how history is compiled.\n \n Now lets address Ezekiel. Obviously, this information was discovered from and anti-Christian atheist source, which looked only at what Christian commentators were saying about the subject and had a poor source for, recorded history. Because you were consulting such a reference to begin with, I can only conclude that the statement you make where you imply objectivity beforehand is false.\n First, instead of consulting commentaries, which interpret what Ezekiel meant, lets talk about prophecy and it genre. Prophecy was a style of writing as well as one that claims to foretell future events. Just as your average Joe cannot pick up a scientific journal and understand the relevance of an article about the differentiation of sea urchins (not a magazine about scientific issues with photos) he also cannot hope to comprehend a form of writing that was popular thousands of years ago without first examining all the examples of it. Another example, someone who has never read a poem in his entire life cannot hope to pick up the works of Tennyson (or worse yet Pope) and be able to decipher them. With that in mind, understand that most prophecies are not meant to be read like a book, they actually are more like poetry. In your quotes, you assume that since the verse are close together in the book of Ezekiel that they refer to the same situations and events. If you examine other works (even non-Jewish ones), you will discover that prophesy writings are more like a puzzle that has been shaken apart and put back together in a more poetic form.\n Now let us talk about history. Our only sources of history covering this point are from Herodotus and Josephus &#8211;who consulted manuscripts no longer available to us and wrote much after the fact- and the Bible, cuneiform tablets, and hieroglyphics. These are the only sources covering this area for this period.\n Piecing together history from these sources, we begin with Apries who was pharaoh during Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s (further referred to herein as Neb.) siege on Tyre. After this time Apries lost popularity and Amasis usurped him and caused a civil war. When Apries was captured, he was handed over to the crowds to be dealt with as they pleased. Much of the Egyptian history about the siege of Jerusalem (which Apries was pharaoh during) is missing. It is possible that during this time Neb. Marched against Egypt and subjugated them. In addition, there is one badly preserved record of Neb. Taking military action against Egypt during the reign of Amasis but because it is the only source and in very poor condition it is regarded historically as not having happened. Before the time of Neb., Egypt was a super power whose borders at one time extended through Israel. They even sent their troops to the aid of other countries. After the time of Neb., they preformed only campaigns solidifying their borders with Ethiopia no major campaigns to take other land for their own are recorded. After Amasis, Egypt was conquered by the Persians &#8211;from whom they eventually broke free. Then we read of Artaxexes who did decimate Egypt and destroy its temples. From that point in history onwards, Egypt never again had a native pharaoh. Being a subordinate of another country seems to me like they were made low to me. Under the Turks rule, they actually were suffers of plagues and famine. I do not see Egypt as a top world power today either.",

Since someone else had actually developed the theory before him and he rushed its publication because he wanted the credit for it, I do not see how it strained his conscious too much. While the scientists of his day did accept it, Christian England is the one that gave him the problems. He was not a martyr.\n Since Darwin wrote Origin, the theory of evolution has had to change because new developments have come up. I could not find the book at the library again which means that its title was not &#8220;The Myth of Evolution&#8221; and I will probably never find it again since it was checked out on a whim. However, I have before me &#8220;The Field Guide to Prehistoric Life&#8221; which give a very picturesque description of the fossil record. Using it as a reference, you can see that most diversification of species occurs over mere 30 &#8211; 60 million-year intervals and then there is usually about 100 million years before the next diversification burst occurs. This to me shows bursts not gradual diversification. I am sorry, but you cannot just say, &#8220;Evolution doesn&#8217;t happen that way because I say so.&#8221;",

   "[QUOTE=Demon38]Priscilla2,\n 5. Science doesn't deal in \"Laws\", \n 6. accepted that the earth was young \n 7. Why does it belong on the philosophical end of the spectrum?\n \n [QUOTE]\n \n 5. Mathematics is a science. What teachers have you had that you have never heard of the law of gravity, the three laws of thermodynamics, and the law of inertia? I can give you a longer list if you would like. A law in science is an irrefutable fact and thereby the highest you can get. However, I agree that very few observations make it to this level. When something obtains the status of &#8220;theory&#8221;, it is also a high honor, but even theories can be eventually overturned in the ever-changing spectrum of science.6. I believe the real reason that scientists abandoned the young earth theory was because they did not realize the effects of placing more than 600 atm of pressure on the earth&#8217;s surface for several months would do to it. The reason many scientists maintain a belief in God is simply because when one learns of all the wonders that occur in biology: our bodies produce enough acids and enzymes to digest ourselves and yet we remain unharmed. O2 is one of the most corrosive gases on the earth and yet our bodies use it without destroying themselves, pure water is the only safe thing for a pregnant woman and yet our species still manages to reproduce viable offspring. Because scientists recognize the completeness of the design the often recognize God. However, in a true scientist's work, God would never be allowed for a second. \n 7. I do not deny that mutations occur, or that there is much observable evidence for evolution today. The part that needs to be placed on the philosophical end of the spectrum is in origins of the earth and universe. In other words, whether God created the earth in 6 &#8211; 24 hour days or whether is took billions of years. This is not something that can be observed. The experiments they are currently doing to support how life was originally formed are flawed in that they make educated guess based on what we know is needed to create life and then perform experiments to see if we can form life&#8217;s building blocks. If the experiment is successful then it is deemed that we have the correct components. That is not a justifier of pre-life conditions. It is impossible to discern what the conditions of a pre-life earth were.",

I'll deal with the myth of Noah in another post........[/\n [QUOTE]\n \n 8. The discovery of DNA has nothing to do with confirming evolution. It was known long before Darwin that traits were heritable whether or not DNA was the mechanism. Heritable mutations support, not confirm, the theory. The fossil record also supports it. 9. 9. Scientifically, humans cannot aid evolution. Humans can exterminate and entire mangrove island to set up an experiment, but they cannot aid in the migration. Human intervention in mutation is genetics not evolution. All the sciences do interact with each other to some extent (especially mathematics and chemistry), and there is often argument as to who should be doing which experiment.

   "I disagree with limiting this post strictly to Noah&#8217;s ark, but I would like it to return to what I deemed to be its original objective: instead of using science to debate against evolution to use it to defend creation.\n Here are the observations that have led me to my conclusions about Noah&#8217;s ark:\n 1. Modern research facilities: Instead of our floating zoo image we need to take in a more practical view of the ark. In modern research facilities, there are no spacious 15-foot high cages. The cages on the ark were probably just big enough for the animals to lie down, stand up, and eat in and were probably built in layers. (By the way, there were three layers to the ark.)\n 2. The ark design: Instead of cages only along the outer wall, I imagine there were many inner walls designed in such a way as to utilize wall space for more cages.\n 3. Speciation: Domesticated animals I count from one line. For example, wolves and foxes can be counted as two different species, but dogs do not get a count. This is the same for cats. Cattle, oxen, and the like would be counted as having one ancestor on the ark. Sheep would have one, goats would have one, etc. You must also remember that sometime we call the same animal by different names, i.e. doves and pigeons. We have records from 2000 B.C. that they were breeding something like 200 different types of sheep in Mesopotamia so we know that our ancestors had some knowledge of the practice.\n 4. Dinosaurs: we can take two pieces of evidence for my belief they were not on the ark for whatever reason. First, it is possible they became extinct beforehand. In fact, the mass extinctions could easily be explained as caused by humans. A recent example of this is DDT. Second, since we find entire herds of thousands of dinosaurs fossilized together in flood beds, we can assume one of two things. Either dinosaurs had no sense animals today have to take cover when they know bad weather is approaching, or there was no place for them to take cover when the flood that buried them came.\n 5. Finally, as to food storage, you should read the book Kon Tiki.\n 6. I have not thought about the fact of different species specifically those in Australia.

If any of the unclean animals died, that would eliminate the kind.\n \n \n3. Speciation: Domesticated animals I count from one line.

And all these huge animals were killed by humans? Even the ones in the America's.\n \n For case two that is false right out if you believe the Bible because it plainly says that God told Noah to put at least one pair of all living animals on the ark.\n \n \n5.

Then during recorded history some kind of natural disaster of epic proportions created a 600 mile gap between Australia and any other main land and there is no record of that natural disaster.\n \n And the second theory is that someone took all the animals that are specific to South America only, and carried them across a land bridge and down into South America.\n \n And for both these theories, the animals were not domesticated, but just out of some strange impulse humans decided to carry these animals along with them, feed them, keep them from eating them or each other, and never allow any offspring to leave this convoy along the way.\n \n I'm really not trying to be sarcastic but these are questions I would have to ask myself if I was being honest. This theory would be too much of a stretch for me.\n \n \nAs long as you back up your proof with something better than, \"I said so\" I will welcome debate to it.\n\n \n So far I have only been talking about common sense ideas.

Species concepts are used both as taxonomic units, for identification and classification, and as theoretical concepts, for modeling and explaining. There is a great deal of overlap between the two purposes, but a definition that serves one is not necessarily the best for the other. Furthermore, there are practical considerations that call for different species criteria as well. Species definitions applied to fossils, for example, cannot be based on genetics or behavior because those traits don't fossilize. \n \nThere was a bird/lizard said to be the intermediate stage between birds and lizards.\n \n It was called an ancestor of modern birds.\n \n Then they discovered no birds had descended from it, but they retain the title 'ancestoral type' because it alludes to this process, even though it's a misnomer.\n \n Secondly they call it a 'transitional type' suggesting further that it is in flux, but then if you press evoultionaries hard on this point, they say it just seems to have some things that look like a bird, some like a liazard, so it's not in 'transition' in the normal sense of the word.\n\n \n I assume you are talking about Archaeopteryx. It is a transitional type and I don't know what you are talking about when you say it is not transitional in the normal sense of the word or that they have discovered that no dirds descended from it. Can you be more specific?\n \n \nAnother is that there are several competing theories as to how moden man evolved. All are fine by evolutionary standards, but how can totally competing ideas still all be accepted as valid?\n\n \n There are competing theories but they are more or less accepted in the scientific community based on how well they are supported by evidence. As we discover more and more humanoid fossils which tell us more and more about how we evolved, scientist are able to narrow down to the model that best fits the evidence.\n \n If you believe the Bible is the in-errant word of God, and I'm not sure you do but it's still an example, then you would think that Christians would agree on every detail. Yet there are thousands of different denominations with various beliefs. Some of the differences are quite large. Why would you expect any less from scientist since they are working with newly discovered evidence all the time?\n \n Maybe this is a good time for you to tell me what you believe about creation and the Bible in general so I will have a better handle on how to discuss things with you.\n \n BTW I get a lot of my material from talk orgins as I said before.",

   "Species are expected to often have imprecise boundaries because evolution is ongoing. Some species are in the process of forming while others are recently formed and still difficult to interpret. \n \n Different definitions of species serve different purposes. Species concepts are used both as taxonomic units, for identification and classification, and as theoretical concepts, for modelling and explaining. There is a great deal of overlap between the two purposes, but a definition that serves one is not necessarily the best for the other. Furthermore, there are practical considerations that call for different species criteria as well. Species definitions applied to fossils, for example, cannot be based on genetics or behaviour because those traits don't fossilize. \n \n\n \n It's simple.

Therefore Darwin's Finch is not an example of speciation.\n \n How can you claim that Darwin's Finch is an example of speciation then deny that you can define species. It's trying to have the best of both worlds. Species for the sake of macro animals is defined by either actual breeding groups or potential breeding groups.\n \n In both cases the finches break the mould as they are both potentially capable and actually do interbreed.\n \n You're suggesting that evolution is ongoing is fine, but then when pushed, it was evolutionists who a) drew the line for species, b) declared that the said Finch was an example of speciation.\n \n It seems very much that you too are like the others in that you're valiantly arguing that such and such happened, but then hedge your bets and say, but it's all really blurred and we're never really sure.\n \n You either need to argue one thing or the other.

But it's all good as long as it excludes God (that is, it's a natural process). I am annoyed too that many evolutionaries will berate religious people because they say that evolution is a fact, based on evidences, but these same evidences support different theories. It's amazingly preposterous.\n \n If you check out my earlier debates, I showed about six different schools, and even a school of thought that believes some apes descended from man!\n \n \n\"Survival of the fittest\" is a poor way to think about evolution. Darwin himself never used the phrase. What Darwin said is that heritable variations lead to differential reproductive success. It is a prediction which can be, and has been, experimentally verified.\n\n \n I'm glad that you agree that that tautology is rather hollow.\n \n a) your web-site might say this, do any search on any search engine and you'll find zillions still using it.\n b) Show where it has been seen.\n c) \" 1: Darwin used the term \"natural selection\" in his book \"On the Origin of Species\" but was persuaded that Spencer's phrase \"survival of the fittest\" was probably 'more convenient' \"\n http://www.perceptions.couk.com/genes1.html#rst\n \"Darwin did not believe that the environment was producing the variation within the finch populations.

One of the things I like about debating is that prods me into learning.\n \n Speciation is the process of biological species formation. As such, Darwin&#8217;s finches are an excellent example of that process. What would be a logical progression of living organisms diverging into different species.\n \n 1. Physical separation of groups of individuals that prevented interbreeding.\n 1. Different environments that produce divergent physical characteristics over time.\n 1. The changes result in some preference to mates based on those divergent physical characteristics.\n 1. Further changes that result in so much preference that groups will not interbreed without definite restraints. For example a solitary pair than cannot find a partner of their group so they interbreed.\n 1. Further changes that result in infertile offspring if restricted to mates.\n 1. Further changes that result in aborted offspring if restricted to mates.\n 1. Further changes that result in no interbreeding of any kind.\n \n In Darwin&#8217;s finches you can see ever phase of speciation except for stage 3 listed above. That is why it is such an excellent example of that process.\n \n The definition of a species is somewhat difficult to define. Not because scientist are trying to be deceitful, but because of the nature of the concept. It&#8217;s not unusual for something to be hard to define. The concept of the trinity is also hard to define but many people believe it. The reason it is difficult to define a species as groups that don&#8217;t interbreed is because living organisms that are separating into different species don&#8217;t just wake up one morning or one generation and say, &#8220;hey we&#8217;re not going to interbreed with that group anymore&#8221;. It is a gradual process but at some point, they do change into different species. I think everyone agrees that if a group cannot interbreed, they are definitely different species. On the other hand I believe that there are cases when animals and plants can interbreed that I think everyone agrees they are different species. Like lions and tigers or horses and donkeys. I would think that even you would agree these are different species.\n \n As far as my definition of a species, I&#8217;m not a scientist in that field as I said so I couldn&#8217;t give an intelligent definition. All the ones I found were very similar so I&#8217;ll just post one of them here.\n \n A species is a small gene pool protected from too much variability by a reproductive barrier. In other words, the species is a population adapted to a certain niche, and if the members of different species could interbreed with each other, too much genetic variability would occur, reducing the success of the adaptation.\n \n Okay now could you give me a definition of a &#8220;kind&#8221;.\n \n \nEvolution is a gradual process is a proclamation oft used.\n \n Not according to evolutionists such as Gould who had moderate change, and Richard Goldschmidt who had very rapid change. All of these people believe in evolution; speciation through natural means, i.e. without God, so to greater and lesser extents, it's all still deemed scientific.\n\n \n Gradual relative to the life of a man. However the term gradual does not mean or imply that the change is constant over time. There are times when the environment \n dictates that changes must occur more rapidly than at other times. If the environment is not changing, there is little incentive to modify a successful organism. \n \n Everything that I could find on Goldschmidt showed that he did not believe in macroevolution and all his theories were before the science of molecular genetics existed. If you are saying that there are a few crackpots even in the science fields, I will agree with you. But most scientist agree on the basics.\n \n \nIt is an absolute disgrace that anyone would adhere to a system that only has one thing/theory in common at the end of the day, God was absent in the process.\n \n As I said about the ascent of man, there's several different and mutually exclusive schools of thought as to how man arose.

I am annoyed too that many evolutionaries will berate religious people because they say that evolution is a fact, based on evidences, but these same evidences support different theories. It's amazingly preposterous.\n\n \n Evolution has nothing to do with whether there is a God or not. You probably read my previous post showing that most people who believe in evolutionist in America also believe in a God.\n \n \nIf you check out my earlier debates, I showed about six different schools, and even a school of thought that believes some apes descended from man! \n\n \n I&#8217;m sorry but as I&#8217;ve stated I&#8217;m pressed for time and don&#8217;t have to search. If you will point me to some post I will take a look. Again if you want to say there are some crackpots out there I will agree with you. However the scientific community does not accept them in general. I could point out some crackpot Christian theorist. \n \n \nI'm glad that you agree that that tautology is rather hollow.\n \n a) your web-site might say this, do any search on any search engine and you'll find zillions still using it.\n b) Show where it has been seen.\n c) \" 1: Darwin used the term \"natural selection\" in his book \"On the Origin of Species\" but was persuaded that Spencer's phrase \"survival of the fittest\" was probably 'more convenient' \"\n http://www.perceptions.couk.com/genes1.html#rst\n \"Darwin did not believe that the environment was producing the variation within the finch populations.

   "\n This theory would be too much of a stretch for me.\n So far I have only been talking about common sense ideas. I will provide evidence for anything that is required.\n\n Sorry Hank, I forgot to mention something you will probably find important. I believe that a sort of Pangea existed before the flood. I also believe that a meteor (or several meteors) struck the earth and this is what created the flood and the continents to break apart.\n Okay, now I will try to answer you in order: Research facilities do use bigger animals. Take for example those that use gorillas. These creatures need a huge amount of space to live in yet in a very spacious research facility one can be found existing in a 9&#8217; x 9&#8217; space. You are correct that if an unclean animal died it would illuminate its kind, but we would have to assume they all survived (by Devine Providence) which is unscientific. The only science I can offer you is that (monkey) research facilities are not in the habit of losing any of their animals since they are expensive to obtain. Wolves and foxes were not the same kind. Dogs however, were created by human domestication of one of these animals. Evolutionarily, cattle, oxen, sheep, and goats all came from the same descendant. However, I would allow for sheep and goats to be considered two kinds, but cattle and oxen are so close to each other (and since cow worship was very popular after the flood) I feel that they might have been very successful in breeding these.\n Now dinosaurs: once again, I believe they had access to humans (because of the single continent). In the geological column, we see various periods of mass extinctions. Evolutionists have come up with many explanations but none of them is sufficient in describing why only most and not all of the animals died. My theory is humans caused each mass extinction purposely or inadvertently. This would explain why not all the animals died. \n I have no doubt that the land bridge existed from Asia to North America. Because of this, I believe the animals were driven to South America (by God). I also believe that at least some of the Sunda shelf was above water and this is why the trip to Australia would not have been so difficult. I believe that after the flood in order to speed the drying process God put most of the water into the ice caps and these began melting which was the natural disaster (which wouldn&#8217;t have been recorded) that raised the sea level and cut off the Australian land bridge (at least). \n Just out of curiosity, how do you feel about the evolutionists&#8217; theories on island inhabitation? I haven&#8217;t fallen back on those out of mere stubbornness, but if you really want scientific&#8230;\n (The &#8220;I said so&#8221; jibe was not targeted at you &#8211; it was targeted at the other person who keeps proclaiming to know science but usually responds with things that are wrong according to any science book.Questions are always logical, but proclaiming fiction as fact is not.)\n I hope I have given a little more logic to it all, but I welcome your questions. In my opinion, true proof is impossible to obtain until we get to heaven and ask God. But my beliefs are based on what I have observed and what I know of science. I am also not a scientist, but until a person has obtained his or her phD, I would never give them that title. I have know too many people with a Masters who had pursued the career simply because they became stuck in it and didn't care for it at all. You have to have a love to be a scientist.",

   "I thought your comments were interesting and I really enjoyed researching this reply. One of the things I like about debating is that prods me into learning.\n\n \n You're the first evolutionist to say something nice to me.\n \n \nSpeciation is the process of biological species formation.\n\n \n I agree that that's what the textbooks say. It's a fait accompli, in that we have different species through 'speciation'. It's a backwards way of looking at things; such as the notion 'evolution is true - how else did we get here'. It is in fact another tautology; species separated through the process of separation.\n \n \nAs such, Darwin?s finches are an excellent example of that process. What would be a logical progression of living organisms diverging into different species.\n 1. Physical separation of groups of individuals that prevented interbreeding.\n 1. Different environments that produce divergent physical characteristics over time.\n 1. The changes result in some preference to mates based on those divergent physical characteristics.\n 1. Further changes that result in so much preference that groups will not interbreed without definite restraints. For example a solitary pair than cannot find a partner of their group so they interbreed.\n 1. Further changes that result in infertile offspring if restricted to mates.\n 1. Further changes that result in aborted offspring if restricted to mates.\n 1. Further changes that result in no interbreeding of any kind.\n In Darwin?s finches you can see ever phase of speciation except for stage 3 listed above. That is why it is such an excellent example of that process.\n\n \n Again, the theory is great. Yet the finch has moved to different areas, but as they have been shown to interbreed then they are no more different species than dogs are different species.\n \n I do strongly recommend you look at the previous posts (thread: \"How does a new species come about?\"). The Finches are not separated, in that they share the same islands. They are not 'prevented' from interbreeding, because as I said, they do interbreed.\n \n There are several islands which have more than one 'species' on it (despite popular theory).\n \n (post 17 I wrote: The classic example given in textbooks is Darwin's Finch, which is said to have speciated into 13 distinct groups. \"They are also a classic model of speciation: again, they figure in virtually all of the textbooks, very often as the central illustration. That is why these birds have become such a universal symbol of Darwinism process, so that their beaks now represent evolution the way Newton's apple represents gravity.\" \n http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/2002/darwin.htm \n Further...\"Biologists now have applied modern methods of DNA analysis to Darwin's finches. Not surprisingly ? for Darwin was almost always right, though he knew of neither genes nor DNA ? they have found that the finches are all descended from a single ancestral species.\" \n http://www.bibledecoded.com/understanding221.html \n This seems pretty convincing stuff.\n David Lack who studied them in 1937 had said \"in no other birds are the difference between species so ill-defined.\" So, perhaps it's because they are the same species! The so-called proof of them being separate species derives from Lack's study when he tried to mate a single pair (from different 'species') and could not. Other people have continued with that mistake. \n \" The respected ornithologist John Gould was especially thrilled with \"a series of ground finches, so peculiar in form that he was induced to regard them as constituting an entirely new group containing 14 species, and appearing to be strictly confined to the Galapagos Islands.\" \n http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/2002/darwin.htm \n But, not all is so clear...\n Let's look at the most widely known book at present - Jonathan Weiner's \"The Beak of the Finch : A Story of Evolution in Our Time\" (for which he won the Pulitzer Prize). (he's an evolutionist)\n \"Back in 1983, for instance... a male cactus finch on Daphne Major (a Galapagos Island), a scandens, courted a female fortis. This was a pair of truly star crossed lovers. They were not just from opposite sides of the tracks, like the Prince and the Showgirl, or from two warring families, like Romeo and Juliet: they belonged to two different species. Yet during the chaos of the great flood, they mated and produced four chicks in one brood.\" \n How then, are they different species? This is a case of a scientist who can't see the woods for the trees, it's starring him in the face... they aren't different species at all... but he's a trained mind, who's had it drilled into him... Evolution is true, Darwin's Finches are proof of Evolution! \n Further studies by Grant or Graham (I can't recall the name) showed that they 'cross-pairings' are often the most successful!\n Thus the classic example of specification actually is not proof or evidence of specification at all!\n (all quotes taken from Milton, R \"Shattering the Myths of Darwinism\", p143ff, unless otherwise sourced)\"\n \n \nThe definition of a species is somewhat difficult to define. Not because scientist are trying to be deceitful, but because of the nature of the concept. It?s not unusual for something to be hard to define.\n\n \n As I say, Darwin's Finch is said to be 12 or 8 or 1 species (the later according to me based on the fact that they can interbreed). The first two figures are given by scientists studying them. And, you seem to be having it both ways, because scientists do say that the finch in question IS an example of speciatation. It either is; and then the evidence should back it up, or if they're unsure, then they can't make such a claim.\n \n \nThe concept of the trinity is also hard to define but many people believe it. The reason it is difficult to define a species as groups that don?t interbreed is because living organisms that are separating into different species don?t just wake up one morning or one generation and say, ?hey we?re not going to interbreed with that group anymore?. It is a gradual process but at some point, they do change into different species. I think everyone agrees that if a group cannot interbreed, they are definitely different species.\n\n \n The concept of the Trinity doesn't constantly change. It won't change if we discover new saints.\n \n Then the Chihuaha and the Great Dane are a different species of dog. They are physically incapable of breeding (naturally). You've discovered a new species of dog!\n \n \nOn the other hand I believe that there are cases when animals and plants can interbreed that I think everyone agrees they are different species. Like lions and tigers or horses and donkeys. I would think that even you would agree these are different species.\n\n \n As far as my definition of a species, I?m not a scientist in that field as I said so I couldn?t give an intelligent definition. All the ones I found were very similar so I?ll just post one of them here.\n A species is a small gene pool protected from too much variability by a reproductive barrier. In other words, the species is a population adapted to a certain niche, and if the members of different species could interbreed with each other, too much genetic variability would occur, reducing the success of the adaptation.\n \n \nOkay now could you give me a definition of a ?kind?.\n\n \n Why do I need to define 'kind'? I know this is unfair, but I'm debating evolution. Yes, it's unfair of me.\n \n \nEvolution is a gradual process is a proclamation oft used.\n Not according to evolutionists such as Gould who had moderate change, and Richard Goldschmidt who had very rapid change. All of these people believe in evolution; speciation through natural means, i.e. without God, so to greater and lesser extents, it's all still deemed scientific.\n\n \n \nGradual relative to the life of a man. However the term gradual does not mean or imply that the change is constant over time. There are times when the environment dictates that changes must occur more rapidly than at other times. If the environment is not changing, there is little incentive to modify a successful organism. \n Everything that I could find on Goldschmidt showed that he did not believe in macroevolution and all his theories were before the science of molecular genetics existed. If you are saying that there are a few crackpots even in the science fields, I will agree with you. But most scientist agree on the basics.\n\n \n What basics? The definition of species?\n \n As I said, there are two basic definitions of species. Animals that have separated to form populations that can not naturally interbreed, or animals that will not naturally interbreed.\n \n If the first, then my dog analogy works to discredit it, because the can't naturally interbreed.\n \n If the later, that is, based on actual breeding populations; where an animal could but doesn't then you've discovered another new species; in man. I know of many white guys who won't 'soil' themselves by having sex with blacks. Even though they can interbreed, they won't, because of 'sexual preference'. Therefore they are new species of humans.\n \n \n It is an absolute disgrace that anyone would adhere to a system that only has one thing/theory in common at the end of the day, God was absent in the process.\n As I said about the ascent of man, there's several different and mutually exclusive schools of thought as to how man arose. But it's all good as long as it excludes God (that is, it's a natural process). I am annoyed too that many evolutionaries will berate religious people because they say that evolution is a fact, based on evidences, but these same evidences support different theories. It's amazingly preposterous.\n\n \n \nEvolution has nothing to do with whether there is a God or not. You probably read my previous post showing that most people who believe in evolutionist in America also believe in a God.\n\n \n That's just wishful thinking. Evoultion is all about natural processes. Find me a respected evolutionist who believes that God was present at every step. Evolution is a 'science'. Science is about measurable things. If you can measure God's activity in nature, then I want to hear from you!\n \n All the big-name evolutionaries would lampoon Christians; escpeically Dawkins.\n \n Most people believe that capital punishment is okay. But, I don't use polls as reliable evidence.\n \n \n If you check out my earlier debates, I showed about six different schools, and even a school of thought that believes some apes descended from man! \n\n \n \nI?m sorry but as I?ve stated I?m pressed for time and don?t have to search. If you will point me to some post I will take a look. Again if you want to say there are some crackpots out there I will agree with you. However the scientific community does not accept them in general. I could point out some crackpot Christian theorist.\n\n \n No, these aren't crackpots, I quoted them from my textbook; Poirier, F E \"In Search of Ourselves: An Introduction to Physical Anthropology\" which I had at university many many years ago when I did Prehistory.\n The schools are \"Unilinear School \n Polyphyletic School, \n Preneanderthal School\n Presapiens School\"\n posted in the \"Looking for intelligence\" debate post#26.\n \n Each school is 'valid' in that there is enough evidence for all of them and they are presented in this textbook as possibles. Some are close, such as the Preneanderthal and Presapiens Schools, but these are totally different from the Polyphyletic and Unilinear schools, which themselves are unlike each other. They are not crack-pots. They are respected. Which school do you believe in?\n \n And besides, what makes a crack-pot scientist? Even the crack-pots have theories and they're still using science!\n \n \nI'm glad that you agree that that tautology is rather hollow.\n a) your web-site might say this, do any search on any search engine and you'll find zillions still using it.\n b) Show where it has been seen.\n c) \" 1: Darwin used the term \"natural selection\" in his book \"On the Origin of Species\" but was persuaded that Spencer's phrase \"survival of the fittest\" was probably 'more convenient' \"\n http://www.perceptions.couk.com/genes1.html#rst\n \"Darwin did not believe that the environment was producing the variation within the finch populations. He correctly thought that the variation already existed and that nature just selected for the most suitable beak shape and against less useful ones. Darwin and his supporters ultimately described this process as the \"survival of the fittest.\" This is very different from Lamarck's incorrect idea that the environment altered the shape of individuals and that these acquired changes were then inherited.\"*\n http://anthro.palomar.edu/evolve/evolve_2.htm**\n d) Darwin's experiments were with pigeon breeding. How is that related to 'natural selection'?\n\n \n \nI?m not sure what your point is. You seem to be upset that the term ?natural selection? is used when discussing evolution.\n\n \n No, just that you said that Darwin never used it. I put to you two examples of where he did. Then, I actually thought that this was a deflection from the issue that 'Survival of the Fittest\" is a nonsense, because it is a tautology. I think I gave examples of where it doesn't makes sense; viz, moose locking antlers etc.\n \n Further, that the proof is Darwin's non-natural selection.\n \n Natural selection can't explain anything. As I said, the 'strongest' animal doesn't necessarily have the genes that will ensure future survival. Strength as a bonus was seen as a plus only by Victorians who wanted to go out and colonise the world. Bigger is not always best, hence there aren't many T-Rexs about.\n \n \n PS if you want my views, they've already been published on this forum. It might be lazy of me, but I don't want to keep on publishing the same thing everytime a newbie asks me that. (to make it easier read/search for Fr Seraphim Rose's book on Genesis.)\n\n \n \n I?m not asking you to debate me if it?s too much trouble. I know how time consuming this can be. But again, I don?t have the time to research this. If you will point me to the post I will read them.\n\n \n I'm not trying to be rude. It's just I'm a bit wary in investing time when I was the subject of much before. I had TheoMorphic, Ursus Minor, SLP, WJA, Lurch, Iamthetruth, Gilligan, AMD4EVER etc all debating moi. The level of honesty displayed amongst them was microscopic.\n \n (They all left this debate though because Lurch made a stupid statement, and rather than accept it, he kept pressing it, and quite dishonestly, his cohorts kept deflecting attention rather than deal with the issue. It got rather petty as they objected to me coining the word 'evolutionaries' as a collective noun for them.)\n \n But in short I will not post these things again, unless you raise some issue to which they are pertinent. And yes I'm reluctant to repost 'kind'. One evolutionary debate per thread at a time for me.",

   "Why do I need to define 'kind'? I know this is unfair, but I'm debating evolution. Yes, it's unfair of me.\n\n \n Sorry but I'm not going to debate that way. I'm not accusing you of this, but I know it is a tactic of creationist to only debate evolution because it is a complicated subject and the issues can easily be clouded. The reason I have some sympathy for scientist trying to debate evolution with creationist is because I'm in the same situation, except the subject does not raise emotional issues. I'll give you a personal example. As a structural engineer, there are many times when my customers, contractors, interested parties, etc. will ask a question like \"How much load will this structure take\". It seems like a simple question that a structural engineer should be able to answer, but I can't. What I can do is tell you what load the structure will safely take which is what I am responsible for. The reasons any engineer or I can't tell you exactly when a structure will fail are complicated and varied. For instance, steel has a minimum strength. Statistically, any individual steel will have about a 99% chance of being stronger than the minimum specified. It may even be a whole lot stronger. And that is just one of the reasons. Now I'm saying all of this to explain that science is complicated and there are often not simplistic answers that the lay public can easily grasp. And I know that is used by dishonest creationist to make their point. Again I'm not accusing you of that, but I believe there are those that honestly believe they are helping the cause of religion by defending creationism in any manner they can, even deception. In other words, they believe that the end justifies the means. Are their dishonest scientists? Of course there are. They are human just like everybody else. But scientific proposals and theories must be reviewed by their peers. And as an engineer who is similar to a scientist in lots of ways, I do not believe there is this vast conspiracy to deceive the public, just as I know there is no conspiracy in my field to deceive. \n \n Okay I've said my sermon. LOL You have presented question that I believe you think are valid question and have in no way been rude. I have tried to respond in kind. I perfectly understand the time issue and your resentment of others that argue against you being dishonest, and as you can imagine, I am often up against the same problem as I have done this a few times myself. I am pretty secure in my beliefs and think I can justify them with the evidence. I try to be completely honest with myself and others and have no problem admitting if I make a mistake. The subject is complicated and no one can know everything about it. Especially a lay person, as you have already seen that I rely on the experts for much of my material. But I do this for fun and to learn and I'm not interested in a one way debate where I don't get to ask any questions. And I don't think I am being unreasonable to ask you to define a similar concept after you have made a considerable issue of evolutionist not being able to tie down the exact definition of a species. As you yourself stated, it is unfair of you.\n \n Okay all that being said, I have enjoyed our short debate and hope we part friends. I look forward to debating you on other issues if we have the chance. And if you change your mind about this just let me know and we can continue.",

Maybe this is on purpose, more likely it is not. I want to point out that the speciation of the finches doesn't prove macro evolution, in the same way that the current difference between Chiuahuas and Great Danes don't prove it. As far as I know, the differences are due not to changes in information, but the elimination of information. That's how micro evolution works. (example - the peppered moth's went from mostly light color to dark because the light color genes were being eliminated) \n \n One particular group of finches grows bigger beaks because the genes for smaller beaks are being lost. (the genes that repress the growth of the beak) They aren't growing new beaks. So, as far as I know, its really a non issue in regards to proving or finding evidence for macro evolution.",

Theories on the other hand do change and have changed recently. He also stated that the burst theory of evolution is currently being debated by evolutionists. As a final note, he couldn't see what point we were trying to make arguing about such silly things as wording (my words not his), with which I completely agreed. In other words, there are scientists today who go back and forth with such things as whether a law or theory is more important, but if they can't come to an agreement, how could we?",

   "Species is the Latin word for &#8220;kind&#8221; or &#8220;appearance&#8221;. The Hebrew word translated as kind means genus or species. There are currently four different concepts scientists use for species. Scientifically, all of them are correct at this point in time.\n The morphological concept of species: uses anatomical differences to describe what a species is. Taxonomists use this and by this definition, the finches are separate species.\n The biological concept of species: uses reproductive isolation to describe what a species is. In other words, one species cannot reproduce with another. It does not work for asexual, extinct, or geographically isolated animals because we cannot observe this quality.\n The recognition concept of species: a species only recognizes certain mating characteristics and will not attempt to mate with others who do not display the same characteristics. I do not like this theory simply because baboons and small chimpanzees have been observed attempting to mate so they would be placed in the same species by this definition.\n The cohesion theory: in this theory, similarities in genes are what determine species. Since I tend to like more analytical methods this is my favorite, however the amount of work it would take to create entire genomes of every living creature on the planet may be quite overwhelming.\n It seems like there is also some confusion as to what exactly evolution is. If I may start from a quote, &#8220;The environment did not create beaks specialized for larger or smaller seeds&#8230;&#8221; Biology, 4th Ed., Campbell\n Environment has no effect on the mutations that are beneficial. Mutations occur everyday regardless of environment. After the mutations occur, Darwin (and evolution) says that the environment will determine which ones will have a better chance of surviving and therefore will continue their line. It does not matter what terms Darwin used (he only used &#8220;evolution&#8221; once in Origin), we (should) understand that &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; refers to the survival of those who are best adapted to their environment and this is pure evolution. It is for this reason that there is an ongoing debate as to whether humans have stopped evolving (not just the fit of us survive).",

   "Perhaps I can clear up the Trinity for you Hank (or further confuse you). We have water, ice and steam. All are of the same substance, but all have different properties. Each has a spciefic purpose in nature, but each is the same. When God wanted to talk to humans and he talked to them in His form (as God the Father), humans didn't like it. So God came down as Jesus (the son) in human form instead of in pure God form and although they were one and the same, Jesus and the Father were different in that they served different purposes. Then God wanted to provide a part of Himself that would live in his people. As both Jesus and God this was not possible, so He made Himself into another form that could live within humans (the Holy Spirit).\n\n \n Priscilla I was raised in the Baptist church and if we did nothing else, we studied the Bible. And I have heard that comparsion every since I was old enough to think. What I was pointing out was that the concept is not that difficult. The defining of the concept in detail is very difficult. That's why you just used a comparsion instead of a statement.

   "If I may say so, I'm glad to see such cordiality in this forum. I agree with montalban's saying that there are 12 species of finch rather than 1 or 2 because they are Darwin's finches. Maybe this is on purpose, more likely it is not. I want to point out that the speciation of the finches doesn't prove macro evolution, in the same way that the current difference between Chiuahuas and Great Danes don't prove it.

So when you see that at the end of my statements, if you prefer you can read: We wouldn't know more certainly until further experimentation is available. Don't confuse my giving God the glory as my using Him as proof of Himself. If you can refute my observations scientifically, I welcome it. (As you did in your previous post on Noah's Ark).

   "Sorry but I?m not going to debate that way. I?m not accusing you of this, but I know it is a tactic of creationist to only debate evolution because it is a complicated subject and the issues can easily be clouded. The reason I have some sympathy for scientist trying to debate evolution with creationist is because I?m in the same situation, except the subject does not raise emotional issues. I?ll give you a personal example. As a structural engineer, there are many times when my customers, contractors, interested parties, etc. will ask a question like ?How much load will this structure take?. It seems like a simple question that a structural engineer should be able to answer, but I can?t. What I can do is tell you what load the structure will safely take which is what I am responsible for. The reasons any engineer or I can?t tell you exactly when a structure will fail are complicated and varied. For instance, steel has a minimum strength. Statistically, any individual steel will have about a 99% chance of being stronger than the minimum specified. It may even be a whole lot stronger. And that is just one of the reasons. Now I?m saying all of this to explain that science is complicated and there are often not simplistic answers that the lay public can easily grasp. And I know that is used by dishonest creationist to make their point. Again I?m not accusing you of that, but I believe there are those that honestly believe they are helping the cause of religion by defending creationism in any manner they can, even deception. In other words, they believe that the end justifies the means. Are their dishonest scientists? Of course there are. They are human just like everybody else. But scientific proposals and theories must be reviewed by their peers. And as an engineer who is similar to a scientist in lots of ways, I do not believe there is this vast conspiracy to deceive the public, just as I know there is no conspiracy in my field to deceive. \n \n Okay I?ve said my sermon. LOL You have presented question that I believe you think are valid question and have in no way been rude. I have tried to respond in kind. I perfectly understand the time issue and your resentment of others that argue against you being dishonest, and as you can imagine, I am often up against the same problem as I have done this a few times myself. I am pretty secure in my beliefs and think I can justify them with the evidence. I try to be completely honest with myself and others and have no problem admitting if I make a mistake. The subject is complicated and no one can know everything about it. Especially a lay person, as you have already seen that I rely on the experts for much of my material. But I do this for fun and to learn and I?m not interested in a one way debate where I don?t get to ask any questions. And I don?t think I am being unreasonable to ask you to define a similar concept after you have made a considerable issue of evolutionist not being able to tie down the exact definition of a species. As you yourself stated, it is unfair of you.\n \n Okay all that being said, I have enjoyed our short debate and hope we part friends. I look forward to debating you on other issues if we have the chance. And if you change your mind about this just let me know and we can continue.\n\n \n You don't want to talk about the Finch, fine.",

   "Based on what my science professors have explained to me this is not true. However, this is not the thread I wanted to debate. My original statements were made to prove that science changes its theories over time (they are not constant).

In other words, there are scientists today who go back and forth with such things as whether a law or theory is more important, but if they can't come to an agreement, how could we?\n\n \n Further to this, science uses words such as 'facts' and 'truths'. \n \n Look at talkorigins.org's FAQs:\n \"Q: I thought evolution was just a theory. Why do you call it a fact?\n \n A: Biological evolution is a change in the genetic characteristics of a population over time. That this happens is a fact. Biological evolution also refers to the common descent of living organisms from shared ancestors. The evidence for historical evolution -- genetic, fossil, anatomical, etc. -- is so overwhelming that it is also considered a fact. The theory of evolution describes the mechanisms that cause evolution. So evolution is both a fact and a theory. See the Evolution is a Fact and a Theory FAQ, the Introduction to Evolutionary Biology FAQ and the Five Major Misconceptions about Evolution FAQ: Evolution is Only a theory\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-qa.html\n \n Thus it is more than just 'a theory'. It is a truth; dare I say 'a law'?\n \n But again this is part of the endemic problem of debating evolutionaries, they'll fight to the death to keep evolution, but can't actually tell you what it is; a truth? a theory? What?\n \n It's proven 'true' by 'evidences' but these same evidences can point to different pathways such as I showed with the several different schools of thought re: the ascent of man; even though these schools are using the same evidences; and coming to the same conclusion in so far as man evolved, they are in themselves mutually contradicting. Yet, bizarrely, it's all 'true'.\n \n Another poster wanted me to define 'kind' or to define 'trinity' this at best is suggesting that he's hoping that none of us can pin these things down; but I bet they don't teach evolution in schools as being equal to the Bible (even though his now suggesting that they're all equally befuddled).",

They were not just from opposite sides of the tracks, like the Prince and the Showgirl, or from two warring families, like Romeo and Juliet: they belonged to two different species. Yet during the chaos of the great flood, they mated and produced four chicks in one brood.\"\n \n It might be good to suggest that they were all infertile mutants, but the studies made by evolutionaries suggests otherwise.\n \n These two species don't seem to fit the rule of 'species'. Science has shown that they don't fit the bill. However none of the evolutionaries I've debated is willing to admit that schoolkids shoudn't be taught this as an example.

Just understand that while I believe God did it because it says so, I would never use that as an argument, because it is illogical. Unfortunatley, I cannot say that others on this board will offer the same statement based on the other posts I have seen. However, you must understand that just as I see evolutionists origin theories as specualtion, I also see theories beyond what the Bible says as speculation. Since I do not have the funds to prove my Noah's Ark Theories (nor do I believe I will ever have them), and since I do believe in God, I assume the only way we could ever truly find out is by asking Him. So when you see that at the end of my statements, if you prefer you can read: We wouldn't know more certainly until further experimentation is available. Don't confuse my giving God the glory as my using Him as proof of Himself. If you can refute my observations scientifically, I welcome it. (As you did in your previous post on Noah's Ark). But don't just remain silent because you are afraid I will just use \"God did it\" as an answer.\n\n \n That's fair enough. Like I said, I like the way you think and appear to be open-minded.",

   "Hi Priscilla\n \n \nSorry Hank, I forgot to mention something you will probably find important. I believe that a sort of Pangea existed before the flood. I also believe that a meteor (or several meteors) struck the earth and this is what created the flood and the continents to break apart.\n\n \n Have you thought about how much damage and turmoil would have been created if several meteors struck the earth. Or how much energy would have been released if a meteor hit the earth that was strong enough to break continents apart. I'd be surprised if anything survived that kind of disaster, much less a 75' x 450' ark. The first seismic wave would destroy the whole thing.\n \n \now I will try to answer you in order: Research facilities do use bigger animals. Take for example those that use gorillas. These creatures need a huge amount of space to live in yet in a very spacious research facility one can be found existing in a 9' x 9' space. You are correct that if an unclean animal died it would illuminate its kind, but we would have to assume they all survived (by Devine Providence) which is unscientific. The only science I can offer you is that (monkey) research facilities are not in the habit of losing any of their animals since they are expensive to obtain. \n\n \n Okay but research facilities are also in the habit of knowing a whole lot about the animals they keep. They also have modern medicine to treat sick animals. Do you think Noah would have know about every animal kind so that none would have died over the course of a year?\n \n \nWolves and foxes were not the same kind. Dogs however, were created by human domestication of one of these animals. Evolutionarily, cattle, oxen, sheep, and goats all came from the same descendant. However, I would allow for sheep and goats to be considered two kinds, but cattle and oxen are so close to each other (and since cow worship was very popular after the flood) I feel that they might have been very successful in breeding these.\n\n \n Well dogs are mentioned in Exodus and foxes are mentioned in Judges in the Bible. From the flood to where foxes are talked about in Judges is about 1200 years. Are you saying there can be that much evolution in 1200 years?\n \n Moses talks of both horses and asses. That's only about 800 years. Horses and asses are definitely different species.\n \n \nNow dinosaurs: once again, I believe they had access to humans (because of the single continent). In the geological column, we see various periods of mass extinctions. Evolutionists have come up with many explanations but none of them is sufficient in describing why only most and not all of the animals died. My theory is humans caused each mass extinction purposely or inadvertently. This would explain why not all the animals died. \n\n \n Why do we never find dinosaur and human fossils in the same layer? Dinosaur fossils are always found in older layers.\n \n \n \n \nI have no doubt that the land bridge existed from Asia to North America. Because of this, I believe the animals were driven to South America (by God). I also believe that at least some of the Sunda shelf was above water and this is why the trip to Australia would not have been so difficult. I believe that after the flood in order to speed the drying process God put most of the water into the ice caps and these began melting which was the natural disaster (which wouldn't have been recorded) that raised the sea level and cut off the Australian land bridge (at least). \n\n \n That's not exactly my question. There are a lot of animals that are only in South America. If 4200 years ago there was a flood that wiped out all life except the ark, and then say the South American sloth started the long trip to South America, why do we not find fossils of him along the way? I just used that on animal but I'm talking about all of them that a specific to different continents. \n \n \nJust out of curiosity, how do you feel about the evolutionists' theories on island inhabitation? I haven't fallen back on those out of mere stubbornness, but if you really want scientific...\n\n \n I'm not sure what you are talking about but I'm interested if you will explain more.\n \n \n(The \"I said so\" jibe was not targeted at you - it was targeted at the other person who keeps proclaiming to know science but usually responds with things that are wrong according to any science book.Questions are always logical, but proclaiming fiction as fact is not.)\n\n \n Okay\n \n \nI hope I have given a little more logic to it all, but I welcome your questions. In my opinion, true proof is impossible to obtain until we get to heaven and ask God. But my beliefs are based on what I have observed and what I know of science. I am also not a scientist, but until a person has obtained his or her phD, I would never give them that title. I have know too many people with a Masters who had pursued the career simply because they became stuck in it and didn't care for it at all. You have to have a love to be a scientist.\n\n \n Most of the PhD's that work in the field say evolution is proven by the evidence.",

   "Hey, Mr Jack. Welcome to the board. I see that you have met our resident small mind. So now Monty thinks that the definition of what is a science depends on the degree granted by some university with which he is familiar. And since most math majors earn B.S. degrees, that must mean that math is a science. But as you have pointed out, math is neither experimental nor empiracle. It is logical and \"proof\" is actually a meaningful word in mathematics. Math is, as you have said, a tool of science but it isn't science.\n \n You have probably noticed that monty is a bit slow. He seems to be a bit rigid and without any understanding of what science is or how it works. And, like any creationist, he misrepresents the data in order to support his opinion. Sadly, his opinion is based on ignorance and the conclusion that he wishes to reach.\n \n A case in point is his continuing discussion of Darwin's finches. You have probably noticed that he claims that \"Darwin's finches\" are able to interbreed and are therefore not good examples of speciation. But in fact, the claim that \"Darwin's finches\" are able to interbreed is deceptive. There are 13 or 14 distinguishable types of finches that have been called species by taxonomists. Monty claims that because some have been observed to interbreed, it is somehow a failure of evolutionary theory. He seems to be unable to grasp the idea that speciation is a gradual process that happens over thousands or hundreds of thousands of years. If a population is somehow separated into two sub-populations that are reproductively isolated, the process of divergence will begin. If unusual events rejoin these populations after insufficient time, they may be able to interbreed.\n \n Monty's big point is that two ground finches interbred. In our previous discussions I asked him several times if he had read \"The Beak of the Finch.\" He failed to respond. Now he quotes the book. Is it possible that he is cutting and pasting my quotes of the book? Or is it possible that he read the book and quote mined it to support his conclusion. If he read the book he seems to have learned nothing.\n \n So Monty seems to have been impressed by the interbreeding of a Geospiza scandens (common cactus finch) with a G. fortis (medium ground finch). He says:\n \nThese two species don't seem to fit the rule of 'species'. Science has shown that they don't fit the bill.\n\n Well, 'species' isn't a rule. It is a definition. A species is a population of interbreeding organisms. Except in one rare case, common cactus finches don't breed with medium ground finches. But is isn't a problem for evolutionary theory. In fact, it is expected. They are quite similar in appearance and DNA analysis has shown that they are genetically very close as well. Such incidents are to be expected of closely related species. In a time of stress that almost eradicated both species on this island, these two birds mated. Others of both species failed to do so for lack of a mate. They died without progeny. Did Monty really read the book?\n \nHowever none of the evolutionaries I've debated is willing to admit that schoolkids shoudn't be taught this as an example.\n\n Of course not. It is a very clear example of speciation. Over time reproductively isolated populations diverge until they are no longer able to interbreed. However, if they should be rejoined before reproduction is impossible, they may produce viable offspring. What a beautiful example of the process of speciation.\n \nHow can it be an example of one thing (speciation) if it doesn't show it?\n\n How can Monty insist on his ignorance? Darwin's finches are a beautiful example of speciation through natural selection. Closely related populations are still able to interbreed under unusual conditions, while more distantly related populations cannot interbreed.\n \nScience says Darwin's Finch is proof of speciation in action.\n\n This has been explained to Monty before, but still he insists on showing his ignorance. Proof is for booze and mathematics. Darwin's finches are an example of speciation.\n \nScience also examines the finches and shows some of the different species which science itself has categorised, to be acting in a manner not according with sciences statements.\n\n Yet another example of Monty's intentional ignorance. It seems that Monty thinks that nature should somehow conform to \"sciences [sic] statements.\" However, nature is what it is and our opinions can't change that. Science, i.e., naturalism, is only an attempt to describe nature. And that is what the definition of a species is. It isn't a rule.\n \n So for Monty, I'll detail Darwin's finches (or at least one version of the taxonomy) that he claims interbreed.\n \n Genus Geospiza\n ........G. fulginosa - small ground finch\n ........G. fortis - medium ground finch\n .......G. magnirostris - large ground finch\n ......G. scandens - common cactus finch\n ......G. conirostris - large cactus finch\n .....G. difficilis - sharp beaked finch\n Genus Camarhynchus\n .....C. parvulus - small tree finch\n .....C. psittacula - large tree finch\n ....C. pauper - medium tree finch\n Genus Cactospiza\n ...C. pallida - woodpecker finch\n ..C. heliobates - mangrove finch (very rare - on a single island)\n Genus Platyspiza\n ..P. crassirostris - vegetarian finch\n Genus Certhidea\n .C. olivacea - uplands warbler finch\n .C. fusca - lowlands warbler finch\n Genus Pinaroloxias\n .P. inornata - Coco's Island finch\n Genus Tiaris\n T. obscura - dull colored grassquit\n \n In fact, interbreeding has been observed only among some species of the genus Geospiza. The are very closely related and are distinguishable only by the size of their beak and their preferred food source. DNA analysis has confirmed the the observational classification of Geospize was correct. They are only recently diverged species.\n \n DNA analysis has shown that the genus Camarhynchus as well as the genus Cactospiza are much more closely related than the Geospize. And yet, no interbreeding of the 5 species in these genra has been observed.\n \n The only interbreeding that has been observed has been in the genus Geospize, which is not unexpected in evolutionary theory.\n \n Monty wants to make a word that attempts to describe a general observation into a \"rule.\" It doesn't work that way.\n \n And Monty asks:\n \nAlso, what's man's manipulation of dog types got to do with evolution?\n\n Simple. It is called artificial selection. The difference is that artificial selection selects for propagation those charactaristics that are pleasing to mankind. Natural selection is the tendency for organisms that possess heritable characteristics that give an advantage to survive to reproduce a statistical advantage. It is sad that Monty doesn't see how man can be much more ruthless than nature is. The point is that creationists claim that dogs are a single kind. And yet, Great Danes and Chihuahuas are reproductively isolated. There has been a change in the alleles of these organisms that makes them separate species by you definition. They do not and cannot interbreed. Why are the not separate species? But Monty doesn't have a problem with a chihuahua breeding with a slightly larger dog, that breeds with a larger dog, and so on until it breeds with a Great Dane. And yet, he has a problem with similar, closely related birds that on rare occasion have been observed to interbreed. (it is called gene flow in evolutionary terms, by the way). An Monty claims that Darwin's finches interbreed, even though Camarhynchus pauper has never been observed to interbreed with Geospiza fortis. Even more telling is that attempts to interbreed Great Danes and Chihuahuas are aborted because they are not viable.\n \n Monty should pick a horse and ride it.",

So now Monty thinks that the definition of what is a science depends on the degree granted by some university with which he is familiar.

It is logical and \"proof\" is actually a meaningful word in mathematics. Math is, as you have said, a tool of science but it isn't science.\n\n \n It is interesting that this has come up.

   "Hi Robbie\n \n I was able to find out that two of the finch species did not interbreed and four of the species produce infertile offspring. That makes them different species. That also makes it macro evolution if the definition of macro evolution is change above the species level.\n \n I read where a Great Dane was artificially inseminated with Chihuahua sperm and the offspring were aborted. If so, that makes them a different species since they can't reproduce.\n\n \n Hello. That is interesting. My own perception of macro-evolution was basically increase in information (presumably from mutation although Rationalist's 'Roman Arch' mechanism could also be included at later stages) since you need that to account for progressive evolution from whatever the first replicating thing was. I suppose I'll have to call that something else now. \n \n Anyhow, the point is that, to my knowledge, what the finches, and more clearly - the Chihuahua and Great Dane are demonstrating is loss of information through change in gene frequency or elimantion of some genes. (ie - genes for smaller beaks, or genes for smaller dogs) Since this kind of evolution has indeed created new species of dog and finch according to the defintions I've seen, it could be said that macro-evolution was proved (if it is change above species level). However, showing that loss of information can create new species can't prove the progressive evolution from the first self-replicator, since that requires increase of information.",

A more accurate sentence would have been Most educated people (including those in the Church) believed that the earth was spherical.\n \n \"Russell says the flat earth mythology flourished most between 1870 and 1920, and had to do with the ideological setting created by struggles over evolution. He says the flat-earth myth was an ideal way to dismiss the ideas of a religious past in the name of modern science.\"\n http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c034.html\n \n Most educated people before the Reformation were in the Church, or had been educated by the Church.\n \n Thales of Miletus (http://www.phys.virginia.edu/classes/109N/lectures/thales.html) is one educated person who, also being probably Greek (Miletus then a city linked to Greece) believed in a flat-earth.\n \n Thales of Miletus  (c. 585 BCE): Eclipses and Stellar Studies \n Our sources for all early Greek astronomy are scant, none more so than for Thales, supposedly the first of the philosophers. Various inventions and discoveries are attributed to him, most famous of which is his prediction of an eclipse of 585 (Hdt. 1.74). Modern scholars are fairly sure he was able to do this by consulting known Babylonian eclipse and lunar observations going back about 150 years, long enough to notice that eclipses recur after about 18 years[6]. His activities also seem to have included star-observations and trigonometry, which he is credited with having founded, but the details of his theories are either lost or obscured by later legends about this early thinker who left no written record. He seems to have  conceived of earth as flat and water-borne, and to have postulated that there must have been some first substance out of which the world arose, which he guesses is water (Aristot. Met. 983b 6)[7]. \n http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/GreekScience/Students/Ellen/EarlyGkAstronomy.html\n \n The above site also lists:\n Anaximines of Miletus  (c. 525 BCE)\n \n Though these blokes were in a minority, I could use their mistakes to stigmatise all Greek science as you are trying to do with Christianity.\n \n And what about in the Christian era?\n \"Lactantius\n The earliest of these flat-Earth promoters was the African Lactantius (AD 245?325), a professional rhetorician who converted to Christianity mid-life.\n He rejected all the Greek philosophers, and in doing so also rejected a spherical Earth. His views were considered heresy by the Church Fathers and his work was ignored until the Renaissance (at which time some humanists revived his writings as a model of good Latin, and of course, his flat Earth view also was revived).\n http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c034.html\n \n More importantly\n \"In 1834, the anti-Christian Letronne falsely claimed that most of the Church Fathers, including Augustine, Ambrose and Basil, held to a flat Earth. His work has been repeatedly cited as \"reputable\" ever since.\" (Ibid)\n \n Obviously Lurch you have proved this point. Both this source, and the first one I cited suggest that the notion that the Church believed in a flat earth stems from the novel \"Rip Van Winkle\" hardly a reliable source for facts, but certainly a good source for fiction. That you would spout fiction as fact, traced back to this seminal work is very interesting. It seems you're prepared to even believe a work of fiction, so long as it attacks the Church.\n \n Although another site suggests that the moronic notion that the Church was pro-flat earth stems elsewhere...\n \"The myth that Christians in the Middle Ages thought the world was flat was given a massive boost by Andrew Dickson White's weighty tome The Warfare of Science with Theology. This book has become something of a running joke among historians of science and it is dutifully mentioned as a prime example of misinformation in the preface of most modern works on science and religion. The flat Earth is discussed in chapter 2 and one can almost sense White's confusion that hardly any of the sources support his hypothesis that Christians widely believed in it. He finds himself grudgingly admitting that Clement, Origen, Ambrose, Augustine, Isodore, Albertus Magnus and Aquinas all accepted the Earth was a globe - in other words none of the great doctors of the church had considered the matter in doubt. Although an analysis of what White actually says suggests he was aware that the flat Earth was largely a myth, he certainly gives an impression of ignorant Christians suppressing rational knowledge of its real shape.\"\n http://www.bede.org.uk/flatearth.htm\n \n Whilst Jeffrey Burton Russell (quoted indirectly earlier) (at http://id-www.ucsb.edu/fscf/library/RUSSELL/FlatEarth.html) suggests other culprits might also be at fault.\n \n All are however united in saying that this myth of yours came about during the crisis caused by the rise of evolution. Evolutionaries were more than happy to portray the Church as being backward; and if a lie did this type of smear, then so be it.\n \n If you want, we can also discuss the same issue of Church/science knowledge, with focus on geocentric theories, or the order of creation or whatever, as for you Lurch, I have plenty of time. I'm sorry I did not respond earlier as I watched the final of the Rugby World Cup, and unfortunately Australia lost to England in extra-time.

You want \"species\" to be an \"either/or\" concept and try to shoe-horn reality into these igid definitions, but ignore the fact that there are varying degrees of \"species-hood\", and this is exactly what evolution would lead one to expect. Your debating tactics remind me of lawyers' arguments over semantics. This is acceptable in the law court, where it is legitimate to ask what the law actually says as well as what the facts of the case are, but in a scientific argument it just looks silly.\n \n \nI am sorry that you don't; you don't want to guess whether it's 8, 12, or 13 species that you're trying desparately to defend. From recollection you had very little to do with this particular debate anyway. Go away unless you've something to contribute.\n\n I have no desire to debate Darwin's finches. My main purpose was to add some information on the Isaiah topic. But since you can't let it go, I will suggest you take the time to try to understand what it is that everyone else is trying to explain to you about this topic. You are not facing their actual arguments.\n \n \nHonesty doesn't enter your debate if you don't feel the need to address anything just make flippant remarks.\n\n Call me Dishonestus maritimus.\n \n \nI notice you too haven't commented on Lurch's criticism of 'circular' or the other dude's suggestion tha maths is not a science.\n\n I am a PhD student in mathematics.

I'm not even trying to get you to apologise (you probably don't feel the need to). But you are not showing any respect for other people's belief when you misuse the 'J' word.\n \n The fact that you don't even realise this is again an interesting point.

You are saying that Darwin's Finch is both a perfect example of one thing, and then immediately saying that you can't clearly define species to determine that Darwin's Finch is a perfect example of speciation.\n \n That simple proposition is what I am concerned with.\n \n That you are pointing out that I am working an argument on the definitions of words is in fact my specialty. I am an Arts grad. I have also done a PostGrad Cert in TESOL. I have done some legal studies, (admittedly I have not continued with them for the time being). I work in a legal environment and have done research for lawyers. I know the importance of meanings of words.\n \n For you to argue that there's evidence that proves something but the evidence is vague is a nonsense. But you won't you'll immediately jump up and say, no, it's a perfect example.

But anyway, at least here you touch upon (albeit with a qualifier) that Maths is a science. So is Exobiology. Exobiology does not deal with the 'real' world and in that sense it too is not like physics, chemistry or the rest of biology.\n \n The science theories behind Abiogenesis, whatever discipline they fall under, must equally have a guarded qualifier.

I had quoted a dictionary that explains this definition, a plain English dictionary if you will.:)\n \n If I am bitter, it is because you are not 'just supplying information', you have come into the argument to lampoon me re: Darwin's Finch, and you threw in an extra comment about the small debate we're having over circular terminology. That you can't see this, is surprising to me.\n \n I am not saying 'Don't put up an opposing argument' but don't pretend that what you say is anything but.\n \n Further, if I am bitter it might have in part something to do with the nature of my last encounters on this Evolutionary debate when I was assailed by divers evolutionaries viz SLP, Lurch, TheoMorphic, WJA et al, who combined poured over every single last nuance of everything I wrote and together formed a block (appropriate metaphor -read 'thick as...'). To have you wade into this now with ill-cautious words is highly untimely. There is a history here that you may only be partly aware of.\n \n The proposition being pieced together by Lurch here now is that because of the use of the word 'circle' that the Bible is suggesting a flat-earth, go read his other comments about the ignorance of the Church. (Go read his post). That you can not see this is amazing. I might have a knee-jerk reaction to you entering into this debate on his side; this is true. I have explained the reasons why I am angry.",

   "You're a bit slow, aren't you, monty. Way back at the beginning of the finch discussion I mentioned that some taxonomists had claimed that the Warbler finch (Certhidea olivacea) comprised between 2 and 8 species. Now for some reason it has become a claim that there are 8 species of Darwin's finches. And even though these taxanomists may have valid reasons for their clasifications (habitat or isolated to a particular island), DNA analysis doesn't support this view. All samples of Warbler finch subjected to DNA analysis are indistinguishable from each other by that means. However, Warbler finches are easily distinguished from the other finches by habitat, physiology and by DNA analysis. (that's one)\n \n The Vegetarian Finch (Platyspiza Crassirostris) is also distinguishable from all other finches by habitat, physiology and by DNA analysis. (that's two)\n \n These two species (which both also comprise a genus) are the closest to the ancestral stock that first inhabited the islands.\n \n The Coco's Island finch (Pinaroloxias inornata) is also the only species in that genus. It is reproductively isolated because it is not found on any of the Galapagos Islands, but rather on Coco's Island. While it more closely resembles the Warbler finch, DNA analysis places its diversification at the base of the diversification of the tree finches and ground finches. It is most closely related to the tree finches. (that's 3)\n \n The tree finches are commonly divided into 5 species on the basis of physiology and habitat. The genus Camarhynchus has two species, the Woodpecker finch (C. pallida) and the Mangrove finch (C. heliobates), which diverged early. The Mangrove finch is so rare that DNA analysis has never been done. But it is reproductively isolated by habitat and recognizable by morphology. (that's 4)\n \n The woodpecker finch has a unique nich, as is indicated by it's name. Again, morphology and habitat make it recognizable. (that's 5)\n \n To this point, none of these species of Darwin's finch has been observed to interbreed with any other as far as I know.\n \n The other Tree finches are all of the same genus. DNA analysis shows that they are more closely related to each other than are the next group, the ground finches. And yet, I don't know of any examples of interbreeding among the Tree finches. They are morphologically distinguishable only by size. They are the small (Camarhynchus parvulus), medium (C. pauper), and large (C. psittacula) finches. As I mentioned, DNA analysis indicates the Coco's Island finch diverged prior to the divergence of various tree finches. But in these two genra, the species are reproductively isolated. (that's 6, 7, and 8)\n \n And that brings us to the Ground finches. These are all grouped into a single genus (Geospiza) and as a group, seem to be less closely related than the tree finches, and yet, examples of hybridization, rare thought they are, occur most frequently between species in this genus. The various species are distinguished by size or habitat. They are the Sharp beaked finch (G. difficilis), the Common cactus finch (G. scandens), and the Large cactus finch (G. conirostris), the Large ground finch (G. magnirostris), Medium ground finch (G. fortis), and the Small ground finch (G. fuliginosa). These birds are distinguished by habitat as well as size. (that's 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14)\n \n These birds are an excellent example of diversification that results in speciation. The case is quite as is expected by evolutionary theory. \n \n I have asked before and not received an answer. But I'll ask again. How is it that occasional and unusual intertreeding of various species within a single, closely related genus somehow disproves evolutionary theory. This is not unexpected.\n \n And, of course, monty's claim that \"Darwin's finches interbreed\" is deceptive. I have explained it to him on more than one occasion. All observed interbreeding has occurred between two or three species of a single genus under very unusual circumstances.\n \n And, of course, there is the fact that the word \"evolutionary\" is an adjective, and no amount of insult or wishful thinking will change that. Even if \"evolutionary\" is used in the title of a book, it is still an adjective.\n \n It is sometimes difficult to deal with the semi-literate high school drop outs.",

It is because I quote from a source that I am accused of not thinking for myself. How moronic. I suppose I shouldn't quote from anyone or I'd be accused of not thinking for myself.\n \n It seems that this sort of criticism is only allowed to travel one-way. My very first post on this forum brought howls from Lurch et al because of a simple error in spelling 'speciation'. Red-faced was I, but I lived.\n \n Gutlessly Lurch has not admitted to his major error in grammar, and equally so, none of his fellow evolutionaries are willing to either. (I'll get to that at the end).\n \n Lurch says 'that is to be expected' that 'closely related' finches should interbreed. If they are 'closely related' then they are not as distinctive as he would like, therefore they aren't a good example of speciation, because they show that they are not separate; further evidenced that there is tremendous difficulty given in actually identifying which members belong to which 'species'; and that the number of different 'species' is highly subjective anyway.\n \n They are not a good example of speciation if you can't actually determine that they have 'speciated' into different species (when some scientists will actually group them as the same species!).\n \n You can keep arguing till the cows come home that the Finch is both a species. \n Just how indistinct are they?\n \n Let's look at how confused everyone is...\n \n In the posts \"How does a new species come about?\"\n \n \nYet scientists categorically claim:\n a) that there are 13 distinct species of Darwin?s Finch\n\n \n In post 52 of that thread Lurch said in reply\n \nActually they don't.  Some have classified them into more species. If you had actually looked into the matter you would know that the warbler finch (Certhidea olivacea) is sometimes divided into from 2 to 8 species.\n\n \n Now he says\n \nYou're a bit slow, aren't you, monty. Way back at the beginning of the finch discussion I mentioned that some taxonomists had claimed that the Warbler finch (Certhidea olivacea) comprised between 2 and 8 species. Now for some reason it has become a claim that there are 8 species of Darwin's finches.\n\n \n I don't know where Lurch gets his figures of 2-8 of Warblers, but I assume that he is correct. So, last time I was talking about Darwin's Finch. He replied that there aren't 13 species, sometimes more. (Therefore there is difficulty in classifying them). Within the same paragraph he said there are 2 to 8 of the Warblers. I am sorry that I estimated that all the Darwin's Finch number 8. I can see that you were referring only to one type of Darwin's Finch.\n \n Lurch claims it's perfectly valid to sometimes list them as 2 to 8. If there are 2 or 8 different Warblers (and I'm assuming here you are correct on this), then there are in fact more than 13 or 14 different species of Darwin's Finch. Do the maths. 8 or so different Warblers + the 13 existing other types. That is why Lurch claimed that sometimes there are more\n \n \n However, now he's seems happy that there are only 13 or 14.\n \n He claimed that the Warbler's are one, but admits experts claim up to 8. Why his estimate is now correct (and his earlier estimate of more isn't) and their's (the other people believing in up to 8) is wrong I don't know; Lurch says that they are justified in their analysis, if you use one measure. If you use another you get one. So it seems not only are they inconsistent with the results, but with the means to obtain those results. Obviously this is a fantastic example of speciation as we now have close to 20 different species! Yes, 8 is far too low a number. I can see why you'd be angry for grossly downplaying just how diverse the little buggers are.\n \n \n \n \n And Lurch, I showed him in web-site after web-site after web-site, that a word, that is a book title, is a noun. His inability to understand either simple grammar (a proper noun) or even modern grammatical theory such as Functional Grammar* might excuse ignorance of this fact, but to keep insisting otherwise shows how moronically intransient he is, which itself is a gross error.\n \n *Which as I said explains the definitions of words by the function they form in a sentence... they don't even use terms such as adjectives, but describers.\n \n I even said gave examples. The word Bathurst appears as a noun - the name of a place, but in the sentence\n \"Stop here for a real Bathurst experience\" it functions as an adjective.\n \n Common dictionaries will however describe evolutionary still, as an adjective, so I understand his mistake. However, I did also quote sites with regard to types of nouns. These include the titles of books, such as \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" which is why we capitalise words such as 'kill'. Thus ... He read a book called \"Evolutionary Theory\"... it is part of the title of a book, hence a noun.\n \n \n \n \"Identificaion of finches can be extremely intimidating. Indeed, for several years I filed away my photographs wihout really looking at them until I could work up the courage to try. I had many discussions with guides, and one year, I even brought my pictures with me. Now, I feel relatively confident in my identifications (but remember: \"It is only a very wise man or a fool who thinks that he is able to identify all the finches which he sees.\")\"\n http://www.rit.edu/~rhrsbi/GalapagosPages/DarwinFinch.html\n \n If you look hard enough I suppose you can see whatever you want.\n \n \"Ornithologist David Lack visited the islands in 1937 and stayed through one breeding season. He built cages and tried to encourage the thirteen 'species' to mate, noting that they were reluctant to mate and did so only 'rarely'. Lack also noted in his monograph, Darwin's Finches 'In no other birds are the differences between species so ill-defined.'\"\n http://www.alternativescience.com/darwin's_finches.htm\n \n \"...Jan Klein and his team have discovered that the 6 ground finch 'species' all have the same Mitochondrial DNA (the Mitochondria are the components of cells which generate energy, the DNA is our Genetic Code - The DNA in the Mitochondria carries the genetic code for the whole Finch!). Since these 6 finch 'species' have the same DNA they 'may continue to interbreed'. But this means that they may in fact be one species, according to the definition of a species in Darwin's day. Next the team discovered that the 6 tree Finch 'species' also have identical Mitochondial DNA, which also means that they 'may continue to interbreed', and so they may also be one species. They then discovered that all of the supposed 14 'species' of Finch are descended from a single 'ancestral species'. The question that is therefore begging to be asked is: Can all these 14 different types of Finch still interbreed with the ancestral species ? If they can, then what Jan Klein has found is that all 14 types of Finch with their different beaks are in fact one species, and that John Gould, mislead Charles Darwin when he told him that all the 14 types of Finch were from different species. \"\n http://www.bibledecoded.com/understanding221.html",

Really. Perhaps a little study of functional grammar might help you to comprehend your gross and stupid error.\n\n \n The name of a book, the title, is a name; therefore a noun.\n \n Just like \"The Great Sandy Desert\" or the \"Grand Canyon\". Grand by itself functions as an adjective. Grand in Grand Canyon is part of the name. Names of things are nouns!\n \n You are separating the components, when together they function as a noun. There's a king of England called Richard the Lion-heart. That is his name, one of them. Lion-heart also is a describer. We use these in surnames all the time.\n \n If you had a son, and I gave him a book called \"The Little Red Car\" about a little red car. And you asked me what was the name of the book I gave him... I wouldn't say the name of the book was \"Car\" as it is by itself a noun. The whole thing is the name \"The Little Red Car\" just like \"Dances with Wolves\" was the name of a character in a film. It might be about a little red car (in this case they are adjectives). It is easier to see it in this Lakota name because they gave names that reflected a description of the person. We have in the west lost that connexion with personal names, but each name of someone means something, such as Barry means spear-bearer. Therefore by your logic Barry is not a name, but an adjective, because it describes someone.\n \n Mary might mean 'full of grace' for all I know, but just because it is a describer, an adjective in it's root form, it has become a noun as its use as a name of someone. Or should we revert most Christian names to the status of adjectives?\n \n Your own user-name Lurch could be said to be an adjective. To 'lurch' forward. But hey, it's being used by you as a noun! Which is it? An adjective or a noun? Well, it functions for your use as a name, a noun.\n \n You can't separate them like you're trying to. The whole is the name.\n \n You don't understand functional grammer anyway. As I said, it depends on how the word is used in context. By your example, taking words out of the context of the name of something is defunctional. You need to study a bit on the use of texts in the teaching of functional grammer.\n \n And remember I started off by using the word evolutionaries as a term I coined for you lot it both a collective name, and it ascribes attributes to you. You said 'evolutionary' is not a noun, when I wasn't even using that word.\n \n And, you raised this objection months after I'd first used it, so you're a wee bit slow. And you're wrong.\n \n As I said, basic English tells you the name of something is a noun. I gave you the example of Joe Bloggs buying a book called \"Evolutionary Theory\". What book did he buy? It wasn't called \"Theory\". It's called \"Evolutionary Theory\".\n \n I actually thought you were being dishonest in not owning up to this mistake. Now I see I was wrong, you're just stupid. I've suggested many reading sites for you to look at, but you refuse.\n \n I've added the following...\n \n According to you, Lurch, all these names, even though they function as a noun aren't nouns, because they are describers, or adjectives... You must ignore the way the word is actually being used.\n \n Lamech, poor; made low\n http://www.ccel.org/pager.cgi?file=bible_names/bible_names.html&from=L&up=bible_names/title.html\n (surely an adjective)\n \n Kacha; swaying\n http://www.sca.org/heraldry/paul/ka.html\n (surely a verb)\n \n CAMERON \n (origin: Gaelic.) From Cam, crooked, and sron, nose, crooked or hooked-nose.\n http://www.last-names.net/surname.asp?surname=Cameron\n (another adjective)\n \n Gregory\n One pope and more than thirty saints are of this name. It originates from Latin and it means 'the watchful'. \n http://www.jesusanswers.com/names/boys/christian%20names%20boys%20g.htm\n (more adjectives)\n \n It is a novel theory Lurch, that you have there. You don't look how a word is used or how it functions in a sentence. These names originally were only adjectives, but as they function as names, they are nouns. I hope you understand this by now.",

His rules for English are to take them out of context, have words standing alone and examining them in such manner. This is not the current theory of examining English.\n \n As I mentioned earlier, just about every Christian name now in use started life as a describer. That they function now as names means that they are, in the context of being used as personal names, nouns. Thus, even if you deconstruct some words and look at them, a personal name for instance, the word might not be a noun, but an adjective. You would be able to tell by looking at its context of use.\n \n I recall you obected first to this use of the word, only after Lurch. You said I had no business other than using staid rationale and scientific language. I pointed out that in the \"Beak of the Finch\" one of your evolutionaries used phrases to describe the finch such as \"like star-crossed lovers\", and \"from other sides of the track\". In other words your criticism of my language use is only aimed at me, and not others doing the same.\n \n Also, the fact that this is not a scientific paper anyway seems to have escaped you.\n \n Thus your objections are doubly stupid. You failed to comment or acknowledge this. I am still waiting. That you are so biased is not my fault, and you need not project this onto me. You were wrong then, and you never fessed up. Now you come to Lurch's aid again like an uncritical ban-dog, and you are wrong now.\n \n And you also don't seem to realise any 'mistake' as you now call it, until Lurch points it out - even though he is wrong. If you had a mind of your own, you might be worth a longer response.\n \n *One of the leading centres for English teacher training is Macquarie University who's National Centre for English Language Teaching and Research (http://www.nceltr.mq.edu.au/ ) teaches Functional English.\n \n The reason we're switching to functional English is to reflect English in how it is actually used and not basing it upon static grammatical rules such as 'x' is always a 'noun'.\n \n As I have demonstrated time and again beforehand, most recently with personal names, they are accepted without thinking as being nouns, because they function as names, even if they are adjectives, or verbs.",

   "As I showed earlier, the name Kacha originally meant 'sways' (a verb). But now that it functions as the name of a person, it is a noun as well. Except to Lurch, Iamthetruth and WJA who have all put up their hands to say that a word must remain static. That they have done so is rather brave.\n \n Thus when they find a question asking for a 'username' and Lurch chose Lurch, even though it is based on a TV character, it goes back to a verb as in 'to lurch forward'. Lurch must have been furious that he could not choose a 'userverb' instead of a 'username'. Nouns are the name of something. It is one of the most basic of English rules; Iamthetruth is a phrase (not an accurate one in the context of its user), but as he has chosen it as a username, it is now a noun. Thus English grows. In such a way a book called \"Evoultionary Theory\" is the name of a book.\n \n But I am being a wee bit too harsh. In part I am at fault for not being able to inform them in a more clearer way, or they'd have understood by now... words can function in different ways.\n \n I hope that they will understand that a book title is a noun. That it might be made up of totally different types of words is irrelevant. Once they are together, and functioning as a name, they are a noun.\n \n How they can cope with things such as the sci-fi film \"THX-1138\" I am unsure. It was created as the name of a character, and must, according to fuctional English be a noun. But for them, it is a nothing.\n \n \n \n Hopefully they can admit to their error and we can move on to where Lurch believes that there can be more than 14 different species of Darwin's Finch.",

It was your claim that because the adjective \"evolutionary\" was used in the title of a book, it was therefore a proper noun. It isn't. The whole title is a proper noun. You used the adjective \"evolutionary\" improperly. You did not use it in the title of a book. You used an adjective as a noun.\n \n You made a mistake and you are unable to admit it. Please take some time to study English grammar if you are going to discuss it. You are quite confused about parts of speach. For example you say:\n \nYour own user-name Lurch could be said to be an adjective. To 'lurch' forward.\n\n Mind boggling idiot. \"to lurch\" would be a verb. \"lurch\" can be both a noun and a verb. Only a semi-literate fool would claim that the word is an adjective. Your ignorance is stunning. And with that bit of stupidity you are trying to show that I don't understand grammar?\n \nBut hey, it's being used by you as a noun! Which is it? An adjective or a noun?\n\n In the way I use it, it is a proper noun. But that doesn't change the fact that it is also a verb, both transitive and intransitive. However, it is not an adjective and only a semi-literate fool would think that it is. You don't know the difference between a noun, an adjective, and a verb, do you?\n \nYou can't separate them like you're trying to. The whole is the name.\n\n I'm not separating anything. I just pointed out that you had incorrectly used an adjective (evolutionary) where you should have used the noun (evolutionist). I was not talking about book titles and was not separating anything. You were. If using \"evolutionary\" in a book title makes it a proper noun, then \"on\", \"the\", \"of\" are also nouns because they are used in a book title. But since you think that I shouldn't separate them, then it is the whole title, \"Evolutionary Biology\" that is the proper noun. The word \"evolutionary\" is still and adjective.\n \nYou don't understand functional grammer anyway.\n\n Whether that is true or not is irrelevant. It is clear that you don't understand it either. You are clearly only semi-literate.\n \nI actually thought you were being dishonest in not owning up to this mistake.

Now you're saying that it can be a noun if it's in a title. Which is what I was saying - context changes the word. You need to see how it functions in the context.\n \n \n The name of a book, the title, is a name; therefore a noun. \n\n \n \n True. But my point has nothing to do with book titles. \n\n \n How dishonest. This is the first time you've agreed on this point.\n \n You've said Post 303 on this thread \n Even if \"evolutionary\" is used in the title of a book, it is still an adjective. \n\n \n So, even when it's functioning as a title, you said its not a noun. But now you're arguing that together with other words it can be.\n \n However, now you've changed your mind and concede, finally that as a book title it can be a noun. Thus, what if the book was just called \"Evolutionary\" it would be a noun! It would be the name of the book!\n \n \nJust like \"The Great Sandy Desert\" or the \"Grand Canyon\". Grand by itself functions as an adjective. Grand in Grand Canyon is part of the name. Names of things are nouns! \n\n \n \nRight. The whole title is a proper noun. \n\n \n Good, again. Then if the book title is \"Evolutionary\" than evolutionary can be a noun. I never claimed anything more than in the context it can be used as a noun. There's a famous poem called \"If\" by Kippling. That in it's context is a noun. End of story, you'd think.\n \n But hang-on that was never the reason you started this debate in the first place, now was it...\n \nYou are separating the components, when together they function as a noun. \n\n \nNo. My point has nothing to do with book titles.

You used the adjective \"evolutionary\" improperly. You did not use it in the title of a book. You used an adjective as a noun. \n\n \n I didn't use 'evolutionary' improperly.

Please take some time to study English grammar if you are going to discuss it. You are quite confused about parts of speach.(sic)\n \n You are correct about lurch. It was a bad example. Show me where I misused evolutionary. You can't. You haven't so far.\n \n If you can show me where I misused the word evolutionary, which is the whole reason you brought up this debate you'd have a case. You've argued against me for months on this issue without presenting the evidence that I misused it.\n \n You argued that it could never act as a noun anyway. You argued that it was always an adjective, no matter where. Now you admit that as part of a book title it can be a noun.\n \n It's apparent that you're still not willing to put up with the evidence.\n \n Post80 of\n How does a new species come about? \n \n Was when you first raised this obejction.\n \nAre you not aware that the word \"evolutionary\" is an adjective? It only displays ignorance to try to use it as a noun.\n \n You must have a point in such intentional gramatical ignorance. Would you care to explain?\n \n When you say \"evolutionaries\" are you referring to evolutionary biologists? Not everyone on these boards is a biologist. Why do you insist on showing such ignorance? \n\n \n I had said \nEvolutionaries is my word (an collective noun) to group together all the people who's religion is evolution, such as yourself who are so pig ignorant of other matters that if they know a little bit of science they think they're the only ones who can discuss it, and then all other matters as well, such as English usage. \n\n \n You repeated it again post 85\n \nMy point is that the word \"evolutionary\" is an adjective and you are using it incorrectly as a noun. You need to think before you write. \n\n \n This despite the fact I was using the word evolutionaries.\n \n Where was I using it as a noun (even though I could have?).\n \n Post 95\n \nOh, that's right 'evolutionary is an adjective. Well, only sometimes. Sometimes it's a noun as in \"Smith wrote a book called 'Evolutionary Theory'\"\n\n \n Post98\n \nYet another display of your semi-literacy. Even in the title of the book the word \"Evolutionary\" is an adjective, in that case modifying the word \"Theory\". Evolutionary is an adjective all the time. You continue to make yourself look like a fool. \n\n \n No, it doesn't modify the word Theory. Now you say it is a noun because it's part of a book, but not then, you said it still acted as an adjective....modifying a noun.\n \n I replied\n \nPlease please please do some thinking before you write. It doesn't modify Theory. \n\n \n And it doesn't, as part of the title, it's part of the title.\n \n This is what you argued all along. That you would try to subtly modify it now is typically dishonest of you. You said that even as part of the title, it's modifying the noun Theory, that it's still acting as an adjective. It isn't.",

As you have I'm sure seen, there has been intense debate over the following words\n science (in relation to maths)\n maths (in relation to math)\n circle (in relation to sphere)\n circular (in relation to sphere)\n spherical (in relation to round)\n and\n evolutionary and evolutionaries\n and\n species\n \n In each case except perhaps the last the objection or question was raised by the opposition. I hope that you're not going to begin a massive debate over definitions.\n\n \n You asked me on another thread to debate you so I thought I would take one stab at it to see if we could have some intelligent dialog without it resorting to name calling. It&#8217;s not that you get mean it&#8217;s that you easily get upset.\n \n I have seen several explanations for species given here but every time one is given you just state that scientist can&#8217;t agree on a definition so there can&#8217;t use it on Darwin&#8217;s finches. Now I know scientist don&#8217;t agree on closely related animals as to where the dividing line is between a variety and a species but there is some difference that all scientist agree is definitely a different species. Like in America we have two deserts that are called pies and cakes. There are some deserts that are somewhere between the two so that some cooks will call it a pie and other cooks will call the same thing a cake. But there are definitely cakes that every cook will agree is a cake and some pies that every cook will agree is a pie. No question about it. I&#8217;m trying to find out what YOU will accept as definitely a species, regardless of what scientist say so that we can compare that to the finches and maybe come to some conclusion that both of us can agree on. I don't want to get into a debate over definitions but things have to be defined to discuss it. Therefore I am saying up front that I will accept your definition of species, but I have to know what it is or you're just going to critize my definition. \n \n Okay let me try this one more time and if I can&#8217;t get an answer I&#8217;ll give up and leave it alone. I&#8217;ll take a slightly different approach this time to try and get an answer. Would you consider asses and horses as definitely different species and if the answer is yes, what is it about the two that makes you think they are different species?",

You are just going to have to live with it. Although I feel that people should try to take into consideration the feelings of others, there is a limit to this. Most people, I would reckon even many Christians, would consider this to be too inconsequential.\n \n My comment on the use of certain Hebrew words in Isaiah was meant to add information to a conversation that was going on.\n \n I'm sorry if my crack about the Church fathers was taken amiss. You do seem to rely a lot on authority for your religious beliefs, and that was merely meant to be \"teasing\", not an outright attempt to anger you.\n \n Finally, I will apologize about the crack about you and Darwin's finches. That crack was wholly gratuitous, and for that I am sorry if you feel insulted by it. I will only offer, as a way of an excuse, that you, too, fall very easily into the \"flame wars\" that go on in your threads. Yes, I know sometimes other people attack without provocation, but when you so readily respond to insults with more insults people assume that you're enjoying this sort of exchange. At any rate, I am sorry if that very last comment was insulting.[/QUOTE]\n \n I don't enjoy insults, that I so reply Sis one of my major failings.\n \n Yes I over-react, but when there are such snipes from so many; Lurch, WJA, Iamthetruth, SLP et al, then I sometimes go into siege mode. Especially as they're wrong and they won't admit it. You commenting as you did, when you did, was to me coming in on the side of a number of people who were then engaged in a heavy serious of insult hurling.\n \n If you wish to discuss the issue of a flat earth, or whatever I'd still be willing to.\n \n I am deeply committed to Orthodox Christianity. Some people have suggested that this means I can't think for myself.

Montalban is.\n \n However having said all that I will not hesitate to apologise to you for over-reacting. I have no way of allowing you to be recompensed for this. I can only say that I am sorry, again.\n \n Further, I do hope that you read the long response I wrote with regard to the Church and the flat-earth. It was raised as an issue to deride the church. I believe that I have positively crushed such a silly point\n \n I also unreservedly apologise for being so late in replying.",

Further changes that result in aborted offspring if restricted to mates.\n 7. Further changes that result in no interbreeding of any kind.\n \n In Darwin's finches you can see ever phase listed above.

That they can interbreed, and do, seems to show this. They are producing fertile young too.\n \n \nI wonder what you think of Lurch's point that there are more than 14 species of it?

Speciation is, to my understanding, the process. All we have is end-result. How that result came about is a matter for debate.\n \n And, as I said, I am arguing that Darwin's Finch is not a good example, because no one has come up with a definitive number of species.

Additionally there is a \"dog\" holobaramin with monobaraminic branches for the wolves, another for the hyenas, another for the coyotes, for jackals, and more for the hundreds of pet-dog breeds. \"Cats\" constitute another holobaramin with monobaraminic branches for the lion and the tiger, for the pumas, another for the lynx, domestic cats, etc. (see O'Brien, 1997). A group of all the horses (equids), all the dogs (canids), and all the cats (felids) would be apobaraminic because no horse or dog or cat shares a genetic relationship with any organism which is not a horse, a dog, or a cat.\"\n http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq/articles/37/37_2/baraminology.htm\n \n \n Say tell me, are you arguing just that evolution happened?

   "Why should this be a problem for you. You have discussed Darwin's finches without knowing much about them. You have discussed nouns, verbs and adjectives without knowing much about them. Go ahead and pontificate about horses as you have on so many other subjects. Not knowing has never held you back before.\n\n \n Hey Lurch, I'd thought you'd have the common decency to apologise, but obviously you never will. Which is your current grammatical theory this time? (You were the one to raise that objection and it backfired.)\n That you'd criticise me now for being honest when talking to Hank is probably because you don't respect or understand honesty. You criticise me for admitting I don't know much about a subject.\n \n Boo hoo.\n Your theories on Finches is like your theory on English, it changes all the time. One moment you're saying there's more than 14, next you're certain that there are 14 only. Which argument are you going to have this time round?\n Not knowing about something hasn't stopped you. Hey, why don't you debate me on the 10 Commandments in Public Areas? You posted some loser comments there. I've replied, and you may have missed it.\n I don't remember which of you evolutionaries made the comment but one of you was amazed that in a forum I quoted ideas from differing points of view - to encourage discussion. You wouldn't have dreamt of doing anything like that. Pontificating is all you know.\n But I've got heaps of time for you Lurch. Heaps of time.\n I have admitted when I have been wrong - most recently you yourself pointed out the bad example I used re: Lurch as a verb only. I am not trying to cover this up - the fact I've mentioned it again now should show this.\n But it comes from the fact we're arguing from different sets of thought. You criticise religion and religious people as being unthinking and moronic. You're dishonest and unthinking and moronic.\n I can't wait for you, or your little gang of ban-dogs;* Iamtheruth, SLP, WJA et al to make the next official statement of the Pontificate of Ignorance.\n *I'd have thought that they'd have; if they were honest, disowned your flaccid arguments. See, I was wrong again!",

   "hello montalban, I don't usually post, just read what other people are saying. The reason for this is I feel I do not know enough about either subject (I am a programming nerd) to enter into a good debate. But I did have something I would like to bring up that I read and see if you have ideas about what it means. Let us just say for example that you are right and that a circle = sphere. \n \n Revelation 7:1 \"And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.\"\n \n Isaiah 11:12 \"And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.\"\n \n A globe or sphere does not have four corners, for that matter neither does a circle unless you are talking about its plane, which in my opinion I think they are. It almost sounds like they are talking about the earth as a square or rectangle, again, unless they are talking about the plane of a circle. So how could they mean sphere when it actually says circle as well as having more support for it being a flat circle with those 2 passages above suggesting they meant circle? Just curious.\n\n \n From memory someone posted an even more extensive list of Biblical quotes which seemed to support your case.\n \n I will endeavour to find them for you if you want...\n \n I already responded to them too :) but there were about eight or nine of them... mostly from Psalms.\n \n I think my main rebuttal was that Psalms are by their nature songs of joy, and are therefore full of literary tools",

   "People produce infertile offspring. I don&#8217;t understand the connection. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better that if they can&#8217;t breed at all they are different species?\n Actually I did stumble upon some info about 8 weeks ago about horses and evolution, but I mentioned it to someone in passing. My understanding was that some rare occasions horses and donkeys can produce fertile young, unless I am getting this example mixed up between tigers and lions. \n\n \n All species produce a small percentage of infertile offspring. That&#8217;s to be expected when you are dealing with something as complicated as reproduction. But when the breeding always produces infertile offspring, then it&#8217;s an evolutionary dead-end. If you are asking if two species are further apart in their genetic makeup when they don&#8217;t breed as compared to when they do breed under unusual circumstances and produce infertile offspring, then I would think that would be correct. But do you know of anyone, creationist or evolutionist, that believes that horses and donkeys or lions and tigers are the same species?\n \n I have never heard of a mule being fertile. If you have something I would be interested in seeing it.\n \n \nActually, what I&#8217;ve read is that the Finchs are so close, that they can interbreed because they are in fact members of the same species, showing different traits, such as within the human species; white people, black people etc. That birds would choose partners similar to themselves is also a human trait, only highlighting certain characteristics. That they can interbreed, and do, seems to show this. They are producing fertile young too. \n\n \n Some of them do interbreed and produce fertile offspring and I don&#8217;t think anyone is stating that they don&#8217;t.\n \n But I am asking you, if you saw the following in a group of related animals or plants, would you think that is a good example of speciation?\n \n 1. Physical separation of groups of individuals that prevented interbreeding.\n 2. Different environments that produce divergent physical characteristics over time.\n 3. The changes result in some preference to mates based on those divergent physical characteristics.\n 4. Further changes that result in so much preference that groups will not interbreed without definite restraints. For example a solitary pair than cannot find a partner of their group so they interbreed.\n 5. Further changes that result in infertile offspring if restricted to mates.\n 6. Further changes that result in aborted offspring if restricted to mates.\n 7. Further changes that result in no interbreeding of any kind.\n \n \nEarlier he said that there were more. If you see my reply to that post you&#8217;ll see that I&#8217;ve quoted where he said it.\n\n \n You don&#8217;t seem to understand that I don&#8217;t care what Lurch said. I&#8217;m not arguing anything Lurch said.\n \n \nBut regardless, what you said re: two species of finch that itself would not show speciation, in the sense of evolution, any more than it would show that God had created two species of Finch. Speciation is, to my understanding, the process. All we have is end-result. How that result came about is a matter for debate.\n\n \n It appears to me that we have a lot more than end result if you have evidence of several different groups that show a gradual progression from being able to freely interbreed, all the way to not breeding at all. If you won&#8217;t accept that as evidence of speciation I don&#8217;t know what you would accept. So unless you can present something else that would convince you of speciation, I don&#8217;t think there is anything else to debate as you aren&#8217;t willing to accept anything as evidence of speciation.\n \n \nAnd, as I said, I am arguing that Darwin&#8217;s Finch is not a good example, because no one has come up with a definitive number of species. It seems highly illogical to call it a good example, when people can&#8217;t even decide how many examples constitute it. \n\n \n If it shows all the steps necessary for speciation, what does it matter whether it&#8217;s 14 species or 14,000 species?\n \n \nThis is not an answer, but a quote to get your opinion on it&#8230; as I don&#8217;t know anything much about horses, donkeys etc.\n \n &#8220;It is believed that the horses (horses, donkeys, and zebras) all are related because they can hybridize, and therefore they belong to a holobaramin. Additionally there is a &#8220;dog&#8221; holobaramin with monobaraminic branches for the wolves, another for the hyenas, another for the coyotes, for jackals, and more for the hundreds of pet-dog breeds. &#8220;Cats&#8221; constitute another holobaramin with monobaraminic branches for the lion and the tiger, for the pumas, another for the lynx, domestic cats, etc. (see O&#8217;Brien, 1997). A group of all the horses (equids), all the dogs (canids), and all the cats (felids) would be apobaraminic because no horse or dog or cat shares a genetic relationship with any organism which is not a horse, a dog, or a cat.&#8221;\n http://www.creationresearch.org/crs...araminology.htm\n \n\n \n DNA analysis has shown quite convincingly that all life is related. It&#8217;s just a matter of which groups are more closely related. To say that horses, dogs and cats do not share a genetic relationship is in my view ludicrous.\n \n However that statement in general is somewhat amazing. It certainly implies that horses, donkeys, zebras and that type is a kind. Along with all cats and all dog types because they can hybridize. For those creationist that believe in Noah&#8217;s ark and the global flood, there is no way you could have that much diversity in such a short period of time.\n \n \nSay tell me, are you arguing just that evolution happened? (or a particular form of evoultion?) (I mean by this that some people believe that evolution happened, but it was started by God.).\n\n \n I am not arguing why evolution happened at all, just that the evidence shows that it did happen. However I believe that God set up the laws of science when he created the universe billions of years ago and evolution is a result of that. That he took billions of years to create mankind is to me an amazing and awesome concept.\n \n Are you good in math?",

You think I've no right to react other than positively if you're sarcastic.\n \n You're not interested in debate... because if I don't agree with you - you question my ability to think logically - because I don't agree with you (Logic is also studied by philosophers).

You keep telling me how wonderful you've been in talking to me, oh joy. I'm sorry that I've not conformed to your high expectations.\n \n And as to the evolutionaries I've been debating\n a) I expect that sort of behaviour from them, and I have responded in kind ... I'm not whining, I'm stating a fact of what's been going on... putting things into context, I have on many occasions admitted I insult back. I'm not concerned about that... I just want to know where I stand with you.\n b) I don't expect you to just point out my 'faults' if you are genuine - because this is what you've been doing; you should be engaging other people in equal fashion.\n \n What I'm doing is being honest. I am stating it as I see it; I've admitted errors; I've admitted that I've responded to the evolutionaries in similar fashion. I'm not arguing any different to that.\n \n And yes I do expect an apology for people who accuse me of being wrong. These same parties would expect the same from me. You call that 'petty' but you're quite happy for people to say I'm wrong. You're just concerned if I want such a thing rectified. That's bizarre. I have apologised when I'm wrong. They have not. But you're unconcerned with this, only if I demand it.\n \n So, either I respond to you, as I have them, or not. You keep suggesting you want reasonable debate, and I took you for your word.\n Instead you keep slipping in these comments, like you just can't help yourself. I would prefer you didn't respond. I couldn't care less. But if you make a statement, then don't be surprised if I do respond. If you're sarcastic don't be so amazed I'd respond. If you put your foot in it, by quoting me out of context then equally, be prepared.\n \n Actually I'm mistaken, as you've got something against Parcum too, even when he apologised. It seems if one party apologises you single them out for special treatment.\n \n Perhaps your 7 year old can understand this; hypocrisy. You insult, but I'm whining if I complain. Putting LOL at the end doesn't magically mean I have to accept your XXXX.\n \n You insult, and I'm akin to your 7 year old if I bite back.\n \n If you can't stand the heat you get out of the kitchen!\n \n \n \n \n And the post was \"True Football: Which is better?\"\n Not \"Which sport is better\"",

   "There's some people here who are unsure of what kind of terminology to use in discussing evolution. One was 'speciation'. Species forming, but not really becoming separate. Another term \"survival of the fittest' met this response...\n \n Post 227\n \n\"Survival of the fittest\" is a poor way to think about evolution. Darwin himself never used the phrase. What Darwin said is that heritable variations lead to differential reproductive success. It is a prediction which can be, and has been, experimentally verified.\n\n \n I explained...\n \n Post 232\n \n\n a) your web-site might say this, do any search on any search engine and you'll find zillions still using it.\n b) Show where it has been seen.\n c) \" 1: Darwin used the term \"natural selection\" in his book \"On the Origin of Species\" but was persuaded that Spencer's phrase \"survival of the fittest\" was probably 'more convenient' \"\n http://www.perceptions.couk.com/genes1.html#rst\n \"Darwin did not believe that the environment was producing the variation within the finch populations. He correctly thought that the variation already existed and that nature just selected for the most suitable beak shape and against less useful ones. Darwin and his supporters ultimately described this process as the \"survival of the fittest.\" This is very different from Lamarck's incorrect idea that the environment altered the shape of individuals and that these acquired changes were then inherited.\"*\n http://anthro.palomar.edu/evolve/evolve_2.htm**\n d) Darwin's experiments were with pigeon breeding. How is that related to 'natural selection'?\n *These are sites by evolutionaries. If they are mistaken then this is problematic with the notion of arguing with evolutionaries, because as I say, it's hard to pin them down on anything... so long as it doesn't include God, it's accepted.\n\n \n What is 'survival of the species'? It is another tautology used to sound convincing. It means, the animal that will survive, survives. This is the meat of evolutionist debate, using terms that at closer inspection they're not really sure what they mean.\n \n Suvival need not be up to the 'fittest' if this is the suggestion that the strongest survives. A weaker animal migh pass on its genes. A lucky animal might too.\n \n So, again evolutionaries are using terms that they're not really sure about. Like 'ancestral type'. Is this a term that means, an actual ancestor, or, is it more akin to archaic i.e. not directly on the evolutionary path of any extant species?",

   "It is good of you to explain your current theory on natural selection, is this the one Darwin didn't use, or the one he did?. But speed is not all that there is. From Post 110 \"How does a new species come about? \"\n \n Take for instance deer. (not dear, I'm not trying to patronise). Two big stags battle it out to see who gets the herd of females. Meanwhile a scraggly male mopes about because he's got no chance.\n The two deer come together and butt heads. Their antlers lock. They can't separate. They will eventually die. The lonely, cowardly, weak deer gets his chance. Survival of the cowardly and weak!\n Look at turtles. When dozens are born, they all scamper towards the sea. Birds walk up and down picking them off. It's not fitness, it's luck.\n Survival of the luckiest!\n Look at lions. The big pride might live in an area that is locally affected by drought. Again, survival of the luckiest.\n This is in fact a better representation of 'natural selection' it is meant to be totally 'blind' it's not even deciding which animals are best suited.\n People keep factoring in things based on their own a priori ideas of what is 'best' suited to survive. You'd think the biggest strongest male deer would be best suited to pass on its genes, so you assume that it will, and that only the biggest strongest one will produce more big strong deer.\n This is of course a nonsense. And when you think about this, it makes it apparent that natural selection would make it very hard for evolution to occur.\n Not just the chance of mutation has to be factored in.\n No, out of that, the chance of 'beneficial' mutation has to be considered...\n and then, the animal that has the beneficial genes, may not even get a chance to reproduce.\n A lion with some predisposition to survival in drought might not actually get to maturity to mate, to pass these genes on. It could be killed as a cub, or never be physically strong enough to compete with other rival males.\n Thus when a drought happens, the lions are wiped out.\n The chance of the right animal, having the right genes, passing the right genes on, makes evolution highly improbable.\n \n \nAs I understand it, ?ancestral type? is either directly on the evolutionary path or closely related to a type that is directly on the evolutionary path. It doesn?t seem that difficult to understand to me.\n\n \n Many people, undereducated such as myself in the ways of science would read 'ancestral' to be an ancestor, to the point of being an actual progenitor. The real reason there is confusion about these terms is because evolutionaries themselves keep moving things around. When Archaeopteryx was first found, it was hailed as a direct 'link' now it is not seen as one. So, when you started calling it 'ancestral' that made sense in the actual meaning of the word, but now it is no longer part of a link, the term ancestral leads to natural confusion... and scientists themselves don't know where they're up to in retaliation to Archaeopteryx... you have so many competing theories.\n \n The Archaeopteryx is a great example of scientific 'newspeak'. It is both on the line, and off the line of descent. So it should please you as it matches all of your criteria for the word, but of course, that makes it a nonsense.\n \n An early fossil bird from the Jurassic, ca 150 mya: Archaeopteryx, Greek for \"ancient wing,\" the link between birds and reptiles, looked like a small dinosaur with feathers preserved in fine-grained limestone.\" \n http://www.ummz.lsa.umich.edu/birds...s/evolhist.html \n Here the key word is 'link' which is a connection. Again this suggests movement, or transition, but again, when hard-pressed evolutionaries will retreat away from such a normative description and move into more vague terms such as those in...\"Archaeopteryx :An Early Bird\" \n http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsi...haeopteryx.html\n Can I draw your attention to \" It is actually intermediate between the birds that we see flying around in our backyards and the predatory dinosaurs like Deinonychus.\" 'Intermediate' is another vague notion that also suggests between (how else did it come to have bits of one and bits of the other?)\n Or \"It has long been accepted that Archaeopteryx was a transitional form between birds and reptiles, and that it is the earliest known bird. Lately, scientists have realized that it bears even more resemblance to its ancestors, the Maniraptora, than to modern birds; providing a strong phylogenetic link between the two groups. It is one of the most important fossils ever discovered.\" \n No wonder so many people are confused... look at the wording around Figure 1 at \n http://www.erin.gov.au/water/wetlan...rds/evolve.html \n \"Figure 1 Archaeopteryx an ancient ancestor of modern birds\" \n Is it the 'ancestor' or is it 'ancestral'? This is more clearly a case of an evolutionary statement having gone to far, because this time the meaning is perfectly clear, Archaeopteryx lead to modern birds.\n This is a way that evolutionaries set up a system of language that suggests that they have solved problems, when in fact they haven't.\n \n \n http://anthro.palomar.edu/evolve/evolve_2.htm shows a figure* that suggests 'ancestral' is on the line of modern animals. There's no qualification at all...\n \n And here is my point proven. One group of evolutionaries using the same word to mean different things. You're all dead certain that evolution is a fact, but when you closely look at what you're talking about, you're not really sure.\n \n \n *The figure is not given a reference number. It sits just before the words \"Darwin came to understand that any population consists of individuals that are all slightly different from one another.*\"",

   "And here is my point proven. One group of evolutionaries using the same word to mean different things. You're all dead certain that evolution is a fact, but when you closely look at what you're talking about, you're not really sure.\n \n\n \n Texas science, and not only its life science, rose to the occasion and opposed the\n Discovery Institute's (the Wedge's) campaign. Here is an example of what the state's\n scientists said and did. The Dallas-Fort Worth area (like others in Texas) is rich in\n biological and medical talent. On September 22, 2003, seventeen local members of the\n National Academy of Sciences and/or the Institute of Medicine, all of them biological\n and medical scientists, four of them, including Alfred Gilman, Nobel laureates, addressed\n the school board and their fellow citizens. From Professor Gilman's published letter:\n Some individuals and organizations have long opposed teaching only\n scientific bases for the appearance and evolution of life on earth. These\n opponents claim that scientific texts systematically misinform readers.\n Why? Because, according to the critics, the books in question don't\n expound upon supposed weaknesses in the theory of evolution.\n These assertions have been refuted in great detail by scientists in\n testimony prepared for the state board and in analyses of the central\n arguments raised by opponents of the texts...[emphasis added]\n We note that these supposedly scientific challenges are directed\n selectively at the theory of evolution. There are no similar campaigns\n being waged against textbooks that don't discuss alleged weaknesses in\n other major scientific theories, such as gravitation or relativity. Clearly,\n the motivation for the current challenges lies not in science, and the\n scientific classroom is not the proper forum for such a debate.\n ...\n The modern theory of evolution has undergone 140 years of testing. It is\n now so well established that its veracity and robustness are accepted as fact\n by the overwhelming majority of scientists in this country and around the\n world. In the scientific community, the unanswered questions concern not\n the fact of evolution but rather the mechanisms by which evolution\n operates...\n \n http://www.nas.org/publications/sci_newslist/7_5/7-5_letters.pdf\n Well there you have it, when we look closely at evolution it is the mechanism that scientists aren't sure of, not the fact that evolution is, well, a fact.\n Monty, you really should stop misrepresenting what others have to say about evolution, it seems to be a problem you have in many of your posts.\n So, Monty, do you have anything positive to say about creation yet? Any evidence? anything at all? Do you actually have a position? Your semi-literate attacks on evolution just get funnier by the minute.\n Lets talk about SN1987A.",

It&#8217;s not that you get mean it&#8217;s that you easily get upset.\n \n I have seen several explanations for species given here but every time one is given you just state that scientist can&#8217;t agree on a definition so there can&#8217;t use it on Darwin&#8217;s finches. Now I know scientist don&#8217;t agree on closely related animals as to where the dividing line is between a variety and a species but there is some difference that all scientist agree is definitely a different species. Like in America we have two deserts that are called pies and cakes. There are some deserts that are somewhere between the two so that some cooks will call it a pie and other cooks will call the same thing a cake. But there are definitely cakes that every cook will agree is a cake and some pies that every cook will agree is a pie. No question about it. I&#8217;m trying to find out what YOU will accept as definitely a species, regardless of what scientist say so that we can compare that to the finches and maybe come to some conclusion that both of us can agree on. I don't want to get into a debate over definitions but things have to be defined to discuss it. Therefore I am saying up front that I will accept your definition of species, but I have to know what it is or you're just going to critize my definition. \n \n Okay let me try this one more time and if I can&#8217;t get an answer I&#8217;ll give up and leave it alone. I&#8217;ll take a slightly different approach this time to try and get an answer. Would you consider asses and horses as definitely different species and if the answer is yes, what is it about the two that makes you think they are different species?\n\n \n What Mojty and his ilk can't seem to grasp is that the very fact that what constitutes a species is hard to pin down is in fact testament to descent!\n \n Were3 everything really the result of some omnipotent anthropomorphic superbeing creating ex nihilo potential \"helpmeets\" for the man he had just made form dust then it should be a simple matter to tell what Kind is which.",

   "\n 1.Have you thought about how much damage and turmoil would have been created if several meteors struck the earth. \n 2.They also have modern medicine to treat sick animals. \n 3.Are you saying there can be that much evolution in 1200 years?\n 4.Why do we never find dinosaur and human fossils in the same layer? \n 5.If 4200 years ago there was a flood that wiped out all life except the ark, and then say the South American sloth started the long trip to South America, why do we not find fossils of him along the way?\n 6. Evolutionary island - I&#8217;m not sure what you are talking about but I&#8217;m interested if you will explain more.\n 7.Most of the PhD&#8217;s that work in the field say evolution is proven by the evidence.\n\n 1. Ah yes, the turmoil, the chaos, it would have been great. I do not think the ark would have been destroyed. The reason I believe a meteor would have had to have struck is because there was a mist that for whatever reason didn't turn into rain. In order to create a raindrop, some sort of pollution is needed as a sort of seed crystal. A meteor would have provided this. (Aside from the fact that we can see fossil evidence that meteors have struck). Now according to evolutionary theory, (well one of them) a meteor was the reason there were mass extinctions. Yet as I stated before in no mass extinction was every form of life wiped out (Too bad people here don't stop debating Darwin's finches and begin debating why in the world blue-green algea which is the evolutionary ancestor of all life has managed to survive throughout the fossil record virtually unchanged while all its more fit ancestors have had to undergo many rapid changes in order to survive.) Anyway, if the ark was placed in a spot far inthe center of say what we now call Africa or Asia and the meteors struck at the edge of the plates, and finally, there were underwater rivers flowing under these plates (based on a Biblical description), then I do not believe the force would have had to be quite as hard as you think. I also do not believe the plates were just shot immediately into their current positions. Throughout the year, they moved to where they are now and then slowed to their current rates of movement.\n 2. Most modern medicine is derived from organic compounds - digitalis (foxglove) for the heart, asprin (willow) for almost everything. An herbalist actually told me the only difference between the natural plant medicine and the manufactured one is that modern medicine causes side effects the plant medicine didn't have (her words not mine). So yes, I believe that Noah could have treated the animals. Look at some of the wounds that \"cave men\" survived from.\n 3. According to the Bible people didn't begin dying for the first 900 years on earth. I believe that in 900 years, man can cause the complete extinction of many species. With any of the species though, there needed to be a large number of them in order to make a fossil since fossilization doesn't occur easily. So even if humans had just knocked down the dinosaurs numbers dramatically, they would not have necessarily left anymore fossils behind. \n 4. Since fossilization does occur under only special circumstances, and migrations after the flood would have occurred (relatively) quickly, we would not find migrating fossils.\n 5. Evolution has its own migrations theories (it has to or otherwise they would not be able to explain why the Hawaiian islands have plant and animal species on them). I will try to dig out some rather recent theories, but I know their experimentation on the mangrove islands is one of the experiments they use to back up their beliefs.\n 6.You are right, most phD's do say that evolution is proven by evidence, but even they can be stumped as long as new questions are asked of them. Regardless of their beliefs, I still only consider them to be scientists (which is why I went to my evolution teacher to get clarification on the law question).",

   "That doesn't disprove the Bible. \n God created the light and God separated the light from the darkness. This theory says (I have not visited the website so based on your explaination) that the supernova occured and we are just now seeing it so it had to exist 168,000 years ago. I am saying that if you read the Bible God could have put that supernova light in the sky partially on its way to earth. After all it says that He separated light from darkness and if He can do that, why not place it (is light a wave or does it move in packets?). By the way, you need to know at least two variables to calculate something trigonmetrically. Which two knowns do they use?\n\n So Priscilla wishes to cast her creator as the great deceiver!

   "Why would God want to put the light closer to Earth apart from to give the false impression of age, if this is true then you are saying God is a liar. \n \n\n In reference to the original website you sent me to:\n I have now been to the website, which is a perfect example that anyone can put one up. That is why I prefer scientific journals and upper level science books for references. If you visit this website and try to click on the links, which he gives as proofs backing up his numbers, all of them are unavailable except one. This one is supposed to be a link to the research of some PhD on the subject when the researcher specifically states the math as proof, however instead it takes you to an assignment for astronomy students at the University of Colorado on surprisingly enough, SN1987A (the second website you sent me to). I find it funny that if you read the background information on the star by the university it does not really correspond to what the original website said. In fact, the original website poster apparently did not do his homework. The description he gives is for that of a right triangle, which the star forms with the earth. The homework page clearly states that this is not the case and the last I checked, you can not plug right triangle trigonometric relationships into a triangle that is clearly not a right triangle. Obviously, the original poster was along the same lines as those people who can use the dimensions of the pyramids to figure out every mathematical function we have ever come up with including the days in the year. However, the homework page does goes on using the same formula used to calculate every stars distance in order to calculate this one. So I suppose if you want to you could say that since we see any starlight that it proves the Bible is wrong. You ask why would god cause the light from stars to be a at different place and assume the only logical response is if He would do this that He would be lying about the age of the earth. I assert that if some one was going to create something that was to have a purpose, it seems to me He would be sure that purpose could be used. God created stars not so that scientists could eventually determine the age of the earth but so that there would be light at night, people could use navigation at night, and so that we could figure out the seasons. If my husband takes my chef's knife and uses it to cut drywall, and it doesn't cut the drywall does that mean the people who made the knife were being deceptive? He can verify that if he did this I would not be calling the company that designed the knife and yelling at them. SN1987A has little other to offer special except that it did not behave like a neutron star that the scientists had initially expected it to become based on the data they had gathered. And it seems to me that the particles reached the ring at a slower rate than what the university professors class had originally predicted it would. I would like to know a little more about how scientists came to their deductions for measuring the distances to stars and how we have measured what the exact speed of light is.

   "that's one of the verses that the church used to prosecute Galelao [sic].\n\n I like that you use Galileo as a reference to the sins of the \"Church fathers\". From your statement, it is obvious you have not really read more than a few sentences about him. The Church (referring specifically to the Catholic one here) did accept what he said. Unfortunately, the other scientists at the University did not like his ideas because he was going against their basic beliefs. Sadly, enough they went to the Church, which was also the law at the time, and they presented a case against Galileo. The Church listened and told Galileo to stop publishing works on the matter, he refused and was condemned for it. The Church goes down in history as being the bad guy and science gets all the credit. I will agree that when the Church bends to the ear of scientists (as it is currently doing with evolution) it tends to go very wrong.\n As to the whole circle matter, you seem to all think that inspired by God it the same as dictated word for word by God. What makes the Bible unique in it&#8217;s writing is that many different people wrote it in many different ways using different styles. Isaiah received his visions from God but after he saw them, he was the one who described what he saw. So did Joshua (or his scribe). (And in the case of Joshua, we do not know if God really did prevent the earth from rotating, or if He preformed the miracle by some other means - sorry I didn't take the course on how the miracles can be scientifically proven). God did not create computers that record whatever you put into them but instead created complex individuals.

For this one, I'm just going to hit the highlights.\n \n \n1. The reason I believe a meteor would have had to have struck is because there was a mist that for whatever reason didn't turn into rain., and finally, there were underwater rivers flowing under these plates (based on a Biblical description), \n\n \n Where did all the water go? Why did the mist not burn up all life on the planet before the flood due to the greenhouse effect?\n \n \n2. Most modern medicine is derived from organic compounds - So yes, I believe that Noah could have treated the animals. Look at some of the wounds that \"cave men\" survived from.\n\n \n Are you comparing medicine men with modern medicine? As little as 150 years ago limbs were usually amputated because there was not cure for gangrene. \n \n \n3. According to the Bible people didn't begin dying for the first 900 years on earth. \n\n \n You are not understanding my question. I'm not talking about how long man lived, I'm talking about how much the animals must have changed in the short period of time after they left the ark. Dog kinds turning into foxes and dogs in a few hundred years.\n \n \n4. Since fossilization does occur under only special circumstances, and migrations after the flood would have occurred (relatively) quickly, we would not find migrating fossils. \n\n \n Fossils occur because of the circumstances surrounding the death of an animal, it has nothing to do with how fast a migration occurred.\n \n \n6.You are right, most phD's do say that evolution is proven by evidence, but even they can be stumped as long as new questions are asked of them. Regardless of their beliefs, I still only consider them to be scientists (which is why I went to my evolution teacher to get clarification on the law question). \n\n \n You brought up the point that you only considered PhD's as scientist.

Hence, once the reproductive years are past, evolution no longer works on the individual but may work in helping offspring survive. It&#8217;s a complicated subject which I am not very knowledgeable about but have just read a few articles on. However I believe there has been some research done in this area.\n \n Guilt is a result of our capacity for empathy with others. It could be that evolution developed other characteristics that increase our capacity of empathy during the development of our brain or it could be that it helps in survival of our offspring or it could be as I believe that God is working in our lives or a combination of all of the above.",

   "How can you be amazed by that guy when if you follow the homework website your will see his math (as well as some of his claims) is wrong? When someone is given the correct answer, they can arrive at it in many different (often wrong ways). This is why I want a book on how they have determined that intensty can measure star distance. When I was doing the actual homework page, at one point I came up with a number equivalent to 8 +\\-1 If I had a variation of that much, I personally would call it a rough estimate and not an exact amount.\n\n \n As I said, I was amazed by the ingenuity of man, not by that guy. I went through the calculations and got 150,000 years. Considering the amount of judgment that needed to be made on different parts of the solution, that seems pretty good to me. That's within 12% of the 168,000 year answer which is about the same percentage as your 8 +-1. And I would call it a rough estimate also, but still obviously a whole lot more than 6000 years.\n \n I didn't see where his math was wrong. Can you point it out?",

   "In reference to the original website you sent me to:\n I have now been to the website, which is a perfect example that anyone can put one up. That is why I prefer scientific journals and upper level science books for references. If you visit this website and try to click on the links, which he gives as proofs backing up his numbers, all of them are unavailable except one. This one is supposed to be a link to the research of some PhD on the subject when the researcher specifically states the math as proof, however instead it takes you to an assignment for astronomy students at the University of Colorado on surprisingly enough, SN1987A (the second website you sent me to).\n\n \n I could not get two of the links to work but all the rest did.\n \n \nI find it funny that if you read the background information on the star by the university it does not really correspond to what the original website said. In fact, the original website poster apparently did not do his homework. The description he gives is for that of a right triangle, which the star forms with the earth. The homework page clearly states that this is not the case and the last I checked, you can not plug right triangle trigonometric relationships into a triangle that is clearly not a right triangle. Obviously, the original poster was along the same lines as those people who can use the dimensions of the pyramids to figure out every mathematical function we have ever come up with including the days in the year.\n\n \n If you are familiar with trigonometry then you must know that the angles of a triangle all add up to 180 degrees. When one of those angles are very small and the other two angles are equal, like in this case, then they will be extremely close to 90 degrees. The difference in the results between using radians, sin, or tan for extremely small angles is in the 4 or more decimal places. Therefore although he used a right triangle which is technically not correct as you stated, is practically correct and is used in many cases in real life. \n \n \nHowever, the homework page does goes on using the same formula used to calculate every stars distance in order to calculate this one.\n\n \n No it doesn't. You can see that it uses a calculated distance and an angle for a geometric solution whereas brightness and spectral analysis is used in general.\n \n \nSo I suppose if you want to you could say that since we see any starlight that it proves the Bible is wrong. You ask why would god cause the light from stars to be a at different place and assume the only logical response is if He would do this that He would be lying about the age of the earth. I assert that if some one was going to create something that was to have a purpose, it seems to me He would be sure that purpose could be used. God created stars not so that scientists could eventually determine the age of the earth but so that there would be light at night, people could use navigation at night, and so that we could figure out the seasons. If my husband takes my chef's knife and uses it to cut drywall, and it doesn't cut the drywall does that mean the people who made the knife were being deceptive? He can verify that if he did this I would not be calling the company that designed the knife and yelling at them.\n\n \n Look at the implications of what you are saying. It has been shown by geometry that the star is at least 150,000 light years from earth. According to your theory, it was created 6000 years ago, or something like that, placed 150,000 light years away from earth, then God created the light in between so we on earth could see it. But we saw the star explode. Therefore according to your theory, the star never existed. God just created the light that gives the illusion of a star 6000 light years away from us so that we would see what appears to be a star exploding today. According to this, God has created this elaborate ruse to deceive mankind into thinking the universe is very old according to the evidence. This is what would be prosecuted in our country as fraud. I realize I have no proof of this, but I always consider the God I believe in to be at least as moral as the creatures he created.\n \n \n \nSN1987A has little other to offer special except that it did not behave like a neutron star that the scientists had initially expected it to become based on the data they had gathered. And it seems to me that the particles reached the ring at a slower rate than what the university professors class had originally predicted it would. I would like to know a little more about how scientists came to their deductions for measuring the distances to stars and how we have measured what the exact speed of light is. Furthermore, I would like to know what slows down a nuclear reaction in a vacuum. (Why didn't we feel a nuclear blast here on earth from this star going to supernova?) I do not want replies or direction to websites, but if anyone knows a good book that I can read on the subjects, I would appreciate it.\n\n \n SN1987A is an amazing observation that verifies vast distances via geometry.\n \n The reason we don't feel a nuclear blast here on earth is the exact same reason you don't feel a blast from a chemical plant explosion that happens 100 miles away from you. The amount of energy produced by the blast dissipates as the square of the distance from the blast so that by the time it has traveled 100 miles, it's an insignificant amount of energy that you don't feel.",

Most people are not even Christian and last survey I saw I believe only about 50% of Christians believed in the deity of Jesus.

   "You made an earlier statement along the lines of some people can only go so far in math. You also relate ones ability to do logic with math. These are stereotypes. My husband who is highly intellegent and even more logical than I am hates math with a passion. I have pursued math up to the calculus level and although I consider myself very logical (I enjoy doing logic problems and cryptology for fun) I am obviously very illogical at times (because he often points this out to me although since I am illogical, I don't always believe him;-).\n\n \n My reference to math being related to logic has been brought up a few times so I would like to explain in more detail. My actual statement was in reply to montalban in which I said &#8220;At the risk of offending you which is not my intent, my experience has been that people who have trouble with math have trouble with logic.&#8221; I was careful to state that it was &#8220;my experience&#8221;. I have been in the engineering field for 30 years and during that time I have trained probably 15 young engineers. I also work with other engineers as well as managers, administrators and others in various fields. Engineers are required to take a lot of math since engineering is basically just applied mathematics. At some point, I began to see a pattern in how people from different fields tended to view logical subjects. Such as understanding a simple relation between the reactions of a structure to the loads applied to that structure. Because I&#8217;m basically the type of person that likes things to be structured, I started asking the math question and I found the correlation to be quite strong. If a manager had been good in math, he/she had no trouble with that type of concept. It not, then he/she had trouble. It was not related to intelligence as most of the people I have worked with have been intelligent. Some of those that had trouble with logical concepts were extremely intelligent. I think logic is more of a gift or talent. For instance I might write a novel, but I will never write a good novel because I don&#8217;t have that talent. That doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m not intelligent, just that my talents lie in different areas. There are a few things that I do very well, but most things I&#8217;m average or below average. So I didn&#8217;t mean that as an insult or a reflection on someone&#8217;s intelligence, just as my observation on someone&#8217;s ability to understand logical concepts. \n \n I will add two more things. I have found that a high ratio of left-handed people relative to the general left-handed population, are good in the technical areas, especially women. The other thing is that I once tried to train an engineer who could not grasp logical concepts. He was a very good person, had an outstanding memory, and was the hardest working person I had ever worked with. I was stunned at his lack of understanding the concepts of mathematics. I worked with him for four years and he never made any progress. I came to finally understand that the only way he got through engineering school was that he was such a hard worker, that he would memorize every engineering problem he could find for a test. Then he would do fairly well. But if someone changed the concept of the problem, he was lost. It was a mind-boggling experence.\n \n \nI believe that every human has the potential from birth to become highly intellegent and posses the abilities to do math and wnything else they want to. However, everyone needs to be taught differently. Athough I love math, I think very abstractly and also love abstract art, poetry, and music. (People who learn about all the things I have done often ask, is there anything you haven't done?) So although relating math to logic seems logical, I think it is unfair of you to make the statement that someone who has not done well in math does not think as logically as someone else. A better statement in my mind is that someone who has not done well in math (and enjoyed it) has not been taught properly.\n\n \n You may be politically correct but that is just not true. Some people are born with very low IQ&#8217;s. Those people are not going to do math or most things well regardless of how much they are trained. The person I just referred to is never going to understand engineering principals. He has a lot of training, but it&#8217;s just not within his capacity. I am never going to write a best selling novel because I just don&#8217;t have that kind of imagination. I agree with you that sometimes someone does not do well in math because they have not be taught properly. But sometimes people do not do well in math because they don&#8217;t have talent in that area and no amount of training is going to make them good at math, although anyone can improve some. And I understand you saying that you think it is unfair for me to make the statement that math and logic are related, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not true.",

   "I like that you use Galileo as a reference to the sins of the \"Church fathers\". From your statement, it is obvious you have not really read more than a few sentences about him.\n\n \n Actually although I&#8217;m certainly not an expert on the life of Galileo, I have read a fair amount about this interesting event.\n \n \n The Church (referring specifically to the Catholic one here) did accept what he said.\n\n \n Yes the Catholic church is the one that tried him, however Martin Luther also ridiculed Galileo for saying that the earth rotated around the sun and quoted the same bible verses to prove him wrong. I can provide quotes if you need me to.\n \n \nUnfortunately, the other scientists at the University did not like his ideas because he was going against their basic beliefs. Sadly, enough they went to the Church, which was also the law at the time, and they presented a case against Galileo. The Church listened and told Galileo to stop publishing works on the matter, he refused and was condemned for it. The Church goes down in history as being the bad guy and science gets all the credit. I will agree that when the Church bends to the ear of scientists (as it is currently doing with evolution) it tends to go very wrong.\n\n \n That is quite wrong. Galileo was not the first person to believe that the earth rotated around the sun. It was called the geocentric (Copernican) theory. And the official church dogma was that the earth was the center of the universe and immovable. Galileo not only stated that the Copernican theory was correct but pushed the issue. That started the confrontation that ended in him being turned over to the Inquisition that found him guilty of heretical teachings. It had nothing to do with &#8216;scientist&#8217; convincing the church as the doctrine was established based on the interpretation of the Bible at the time and all &#8216;scientific&#8217; thought had to agree with that interpretation, the main cause of what is called the dark ages. The first attacks against Galileo came from a Dominican friar and professor of history and the notion that it was the fault of &#8216;scientist&#8217; influencing the church is a fairly recent distortion of the facts to try and excuse the behavior of the church. \n \n \n \nAs to the whole circle matter, you seem to all think that inspired by God it the same as dictated word for word by God. What makes the Bible unique in it&#8217;s writing is that many different people wrote it in many different ways using different styles. Isaiah received his visions from God but after he saw them, he was the one who described what he saw. So did Joshua (or his scribe).\n\n \n The Bible is an excellent recording of Jewish history for the time of it&#8217;s writing. It also conveys the evolution of the Jewish faith and their developing understanding of God. It is not a scientific book and trying to use it as such only degrades the real value of this important work.\n \n \n (And in the case of Joshua, we do not know if God really did prevent the earth from rotating, or if He preformed the miracle by some other means - sorry I didn't take the course on how the miracles can be scientifically proven).\n\n \n I thought you stated that you would not use miracles for explanations of physical events. Miracles can not be scientifically proven simply because they are supernatural with is outside the realm of science.",

   "Why is it a fraud? Well because if the earth is 6000 years old, then God gave evidence that it is a lot older. What&#8217;s so difficult about understanding that?\n 2. how about just simply having &#8216;kinds&#8217; with completely different DNA that is not even remotely similar to other &#8216;kinds&#8217; and that never changes. And that&#8217;s only one simple thing. That would be a little stamp &#8220;Poofed by God&#8221;.\n\n 1.I know you don't believe this, but just work with me a minute Hank and for one second believe the enitire Bible is true. If that is the case, then all the prophesies of the O.T. predicted the Messiah would come to save us from our sins. Jesus not only walked a blameless life to be the sacrifice for our sins, but He also did an uncountable amount of miracles to prove to those around Him that He was the Messiah and He was the Son of God. All those people had the same scriptures. They studied them and believed them without a doubt, yet even though they proved that Jesus was the one waited for, none of them could see even after He rose again. Even Paul couldn't see until Jesus finally appeared to Him. Now God gives us the Bible which basically answers the most important things about how we can better serve Him. Keep in mind that the Bible clearly states that God wants to save as much of His creation as possible, but scientists have figured out how old the earth should be in their eyes which is insignificant in Gods eyes since He already knows, and they say that God is wrong because their calculations do not add up to His. The Sanhedrin thought it had everything figured out too and that Jesus was not who He claimed to be. Scientists admit they can make errors and their theories change to reflect any errors they detect. Because even scientists spend many hours arguing over how many billions of years old things are, I find it as difficult to accept their ages based on whatever, as you and the others here find my method just as difficult to accept. \n 2. If I am remembering all my genetics correctly, all DNA has to be similar in some way shape or form. The nucleotides form just the right amount of base pairs to code for all the things our cells need. The furthest difference you can find in DNA is between the circular bacterial DNA and our own paired version. In my opinion (based on what I know of genetics) God could not have created DNA any differently because no other chemicals would have allowed it to work correctly.",

   "I believe that people with low IQ's can be taught to do well in math simply because of the work of Maria Montessori. She only worked with those who were in the low IQ range and since they all did well, that is where I get my statement about learning styles. I have also worked with children who have severe learning disablilites such as autism and very server developmental problems. While some could not physically meet up with learning demands, all of them showed a marked increase in development after the proper kind of therapy.\n As to the man you worked with, he seems to have gone his whole life not learning abstract thought (not logic). Their are six different levels of learning in Blooms taxonomy and within each of these is four subcatagories. There are quite a few steps of learning between remember and create and in order to get him up on the create level you would have had to start by teaching him the next step, but it is impossible for people to jump from step one to six without going in between. I am working with a girl right now who should be at a sixth grade level and so far had only learned how to remember. She also learns best through kinetic and auditory stimulus which makes things very difficult. However, I have manged thus far to get her from a third grade level to a fourth grade level and am working on getting her to think at higher levels. I will let you know if my experiment turns out a failure (if I still write here when I have finished with her).\n True you may never write a novel, but you dream at night, so I assume you have some sort of imagination.

   "\n That is quite wrong. Galileo was not the first person to believe that the earth rotated around the sun. It was called the geocentric (Copernican) theory. The first attacks against Galileo came from a Dominican friar and professor of history and the notion that it was the fault of &#8216;scientist&#8217; influencing the church is a fairly recent distortion of the facts to try and excuse the behavior of the church. \n It is not a scientific book and trying to use it as such only degrades the real value of this important work.\n I thought you stated that you would not use miracles for explanations of physical events. Miracles can not be scientifically proven simply because they are supernatural with is outside the realm of science.\n\n Once again I use Encarta, I am planning to read a book entitled Galileo in the future, but I haven't gotten to it yet. I know that he was not the first, however, the members at the university were the ones who didn't approve of the idea, and they went to the bishop. Perhaps Encarta has been corrupted by the Catholic church. I find it odd that Galileo recanted, yet Joan of Arc (in the end) did not. \n I never claim that the Bible is scientific, how ever I do say it is a historical document and the majority of the events within it can be proven to have happened through other sources.\n I do not use miracles for explanations of physical events. I merely stated that I did not take a class in it. At the state university which I attended, my developmental biology teacher considered herself to be a Christian who believed in evolution. Since I was the only student in the class who held to my beliefs not only was I laughed at, but she felt that she needed to take me under her wing and convince me differently. Nothing much came of our talks except that she at one point she informed me of this class which was offered that used science to prove the miracles of Jesus. It is not what you think, but more of a Jesus walked on a sand bar not the water/ God created the world in 6 theoretical days sort of thing. That is why it never interested me, but obviously some scientist had to sit down and figure out enough of it to fill a class, so I know there are scientific explainations for some of the miracles. \n HOwever, when you deal with creation and the age of the earth, if you are going to combat it with the way science dates the earth, I will use a way that both the Bible can be right and science can be right. This is why I see nothing wrong with believe that God can create starlight without stars simply for our enjoyment. Someone may ask, although they haven't yet, why didn't he just make them closer to the earth? For some reaon I personally would find this more logical than \"if God did that He would be a liar\". since God didn't say starlight has to be so old because you can calculate the speed of light in thus and such away, and then use that to figure out the age of the earth, I don't see Him as being a liar.",
