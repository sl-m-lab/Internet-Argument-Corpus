   "Excellent documentary about the US pro-Israel media bias, explaining the mechanisms by which stories are filtered and language sanitised in order to present the aggressive occupation of Palestine as legitimate and Israeli oppression as \"self-defence\":\n \n NB this film is 1hr 20mins so while essential viewing if you are at all interested in the Israel/Palestine situation wait until you have time!\n \n Peace, Propaganda and the Promised Land\n \n The media bias and Israeli lobby in Washington are the principle obstacles to the middle east \"Peace Process\" - inverted commas used because what has been labelled Peace Process has in fact been the process by which peace has been avoided, through the US' use of UNSC vetos and $100 bn of aid since Israel's formation, the majority in the form of military equipment and loans given on condition that the money is used to buy military equipment from Western companies.\n \n This film highlights just why many US citizens fail to appreciate the way their country is seen around the world - because their media sanitises global events and the US' role in them. Realising the utterly obvious disparity between what US administrations say and what they do is paramount to understanding the world situation today with regard to \"anti-americanism\", terrorism and the Palestinian resistance efforts.\n \n The only conceivable road to peace is for the US to stop funding Israel's war crimes and occupation, and provide equal (per capita) aid to both states for construction, social programs and (particularly important) sorting out the water supply. \n \n But any criticism of Israel or the relationship between the US and Israel is the last taboo in the US media, as is suggesting alternatives to current policy.",
