   "Yep after watching the crooked media like Fox. And all the cover ups in the Bush admin I will go with Kerry. Bush wanted way before he got into office now we are in Iraq I sorry but we did not have to go there we did not finsh the job in Affgansten that is where we should be doing not Iraq. I do not like Sadam dont get me wrong the Concervatives blew this one they said there is WMD that is why we went to Iraq. But folks there was none now was there so they change there tune to Iraqy freedom. Who cares the problem we have had is we have stuck our noses where they dont belong. And as far church does not belong in goverment. Bush has done well in pushing that issue. Come on give Kerry a chance he cant screw it up any more than this no brainer. I do support our troops, but not the Iraqy war. and yes did the UN back us no because they were right there was no WMDs alot of other countrys hate us now because Bushs trigger happy happygo lucky theme. Kerry all the way. I havent seen Bush address the high price of fuel to much well his daddy is getting rich off us.",
