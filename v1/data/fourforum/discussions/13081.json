   "Ok, this portion of the forums has been dead since 2006 so I would love to show everyone this rather wonderful player I own. The Cowon s9 is basically the Ferrari of PMP's and Audiophiles.\n \n It supports OGG, FLAC, WAV, as well as your standard WMA and MP3 formats. But it is by far the best sounding player hands down. There is just so many things to point out about it and I'll be posting some links for you all.\n \n It has over 20 different EQ's including your own preset custom EQ's you can make. And when I say EQ i mean full on customization. The player also sports a wonderful AMOLED screen that just beats anything including the ipod touch hands down!\n \n I know what your thinking but trust me this player has turned me into a video buff with it's wonderful quality. The AMOLED screen also requires half the power standard OLED screens have. Putting the battery life at a whopping 55 hours of audio and 11 hours of video.\n \n I can attest to this, as I watched all 3 matrix trilogy movies back to back with full eq settings and and max brightness. The player also has a flash based UCI interface that I may add is fully customizable. Instead of being locked out of your player, Cowon gives the user complete freedom to make their own player really theirs. \n \n There are at least 25 full custom themes from Cowon users, as well as dozens of wallpapers, and specific browser theme's and Music interfaces. The Cowon also features the shake function similar to that of the touch. Also it has full 360 degree turning function. Meaning you turn it in any direction the screen rotates to your adjustments.\n \n There is just not enough I can say about this player! It comes in 8, 16, and 32 gig. A rumored 64 gig is expected to be released later this year as well as a ceramic white version.\n \n The player is made in Korea and they have an American division based out of Irvine California. The 32 gig is priced around $270.00 USD on B&H.com\n \n I would recommend purchasing the player from them seeing as I did and had no issues. They do not charge sales tax and now have a promotion for free shipping.\n \n Here are a few links I'm sure you all will enjoy:\n \n Cowon S9 - iAudiophile.net Forums\n \n YouTube - AMP3 TV - Cowon S9 Review\n \n YouTube - Cowon S9's screen vs iPod Touch\n \n COWON America",

   "As an update Cowon just released a firmware update to version 2.41. We had been getting beta versions which added some wonderful features such as gapless playback, a better responce from the interface and such.\n \n Now with the new firmware release they have taken the s9's greatest strength and pushed it even further, the sound quality. Jet Effect's has now been upgraded to version 3.0 with a total recalibration of the EQ manager including a new Reverb feature that just sweetens the music that much more. \n \n I currently have it at a setting of 2 for general listening and a seperate custom user saved EQ setting for movies at 1. The only way to explain it's improvement is the music feels more \"live\" its a combination of warmth, depth, and detail that is just slipped in that really brings out voices in your songs you may have not heard before.\n \n A perfect example of this is the song Mars God of War from Gustav Holst's the Planets. Natrually all of my music library on the Cowon is based in FLAC format (lostless audio which is basically compression of a .WAV file without a loss in any quality), and with the new reverb feature the upright bass line in the song just shines through. Whereas most classical pieces have a \"muddy\" quality where the lower voices are lost to distortion, the new Jet Effects calibration actually makes the distinct vibration and resonance of such lower voices clear and precise.\n \n Another feature implemented is a total revamping of the touch interface to the s9. Early reviews deemed the s9's interface not even close to that of the touch;s UI interface. This was actually true in most regards as early firmware versions had issues especially with custom UI's made by Cowon Owners. \n \n Now with 2.4, the interface has been totally overhauled. I can personally say I know long need to double click or double swipe an icon ever. The interface is smooth, precise, and in my opinion, on par with the response to that of the touch's UI.\n \n I urge everyone to check out this player. With these new implications from Cowon (which by the way they actually listened to the user community and implemented these changes via user request), this player is second to none in audio and video quality.",
