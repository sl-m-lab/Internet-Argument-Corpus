Thank you.\n\n \n I think you're ultimately going to defend gay sex regardless of what you see in the Bible, because of your son, but here's some of the scriptures anyway:\n \n Leviticus 18:22 - \"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\" \n \n Leviticus 20:13 - \"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - &#8220;But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine&#8230;&#8221;\n \n Jude 7 &#8211; &#8220;In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.&#8221; \n \n There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that.",

   "hi proudmom, welcome to the forums.\n \n i think the bible is pretty clear that homosexuality is wrong, in the new and old testament. however, by modern day society's standpoint, about 50% of what the bible says is wrong, morally, so to base your life, worldview, opinions, arguments etc. on the bible in the literal sense, would be contributing to mass hatred among other hideous things. what i, and the other freethinkers on this board try to do is show people that the bible is not a valid resource for opinions. in the same way homosexuality is wrong in the bible, many other teachings are ignored by religious people on the basis that society has moved on. for some reason, the biblical teachings on homosexuality still rage to this day. i hope soon that opinion will be thrown into the vault of things-in-the-bible-religious-people-dont-believe-in-anymore with the other opinions such as selling your daughter to slavery and stoning children to death if they are disobedient.\n \n these are just my personal opinions, that if i were to have a gay son or daughter, i would definitely not turn to the bible for answers. nor would i teach him to repent his sins based on what the bible says - assuredly this means turning him from gay to straight... which is laughable.\n \n EDIT also, keep in mind this: read the things Easyrider says. they dont actually refer to homosexuality, but strictly gay sex. with your experience, you would know as well as anyone that that's not what homosexuality is. so that being said, my first statement - the bible is clear that homosexuality is wrong - may not even be correct. its gay sex the bible doesnt like.",

   "Boy there are a great percentage of heterosexuals engaging in sodomy.\nIndeed:\n \n Anal sex - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \nA 2005 survey of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a rising incidence of anal relations in the American heterosexual population. The survey showed that 40% of men and 35% of women between 25 and 44 had engaged in heterosexual anal sex; in 1992 a similar survey found that only 26% of men 18 to 59 and 20% of women 18 to 59 had. By way of comparison, seven times as many women as gay men engage in anal intercourse, a figure reflecting the greater overall heterosexual population.\n Another survey in 2008 focused on a much younger demographic of teens and young adults aged 15-21. It found that 16% of 1350 surveyed had had anal sex in the previous 3 months, with condoms being used 29% of the time. However, given the subject matter, the survey hypothesized the prevalence was probably underestimated.\n \n Figures for prevalence can vary amongst different demographics, regions, and nationalities. A 2001 French survey of five hundred female respondents concluded that a total of 29% had practiced anal sex, and one third of these claimed to have enjoyed the experience. In contrast, in a 1999 South Korean survey of 586 women, 3.5% of respondents reported having had anal sex.\n \n Figures for the prevalence of sexual behavior can also fluctuate over time. Edward O. Laumann's 1992 survey, reported in The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States, found that about 20% of heterosexuals have engaged in anal sex. Sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, working in the 1940s, had found that number to be closer to 40% at the time. More recently, a researcher from the University of British Columbia in 2005 put the number of heterosexuals who have practiced anal sex at between 30% and 50%. According to Columbia University's health website, Go Ask Alice!: \"Studies indicate that about 25 percent of heterosexual couples have had anal sex at least once, and 10 percent regularly have anal penetration.\"\n",

Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - \"But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine...\"\n \n Jude 7 - \"In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion.

Just the quote? \n \n Then tie it into the \"Two Greatest Laws.\" What are the two greatest laws? How did Jesus answer that?\n\n \n Ok let's explore that since it is so prominent in your mind right now. Love your neighbor as you love yourself. This being from Jesus so it would be safe to say this overrides any potential conflict with any interpretation attributed to an Apostle, without hearing you whine about they are all in agreement please.\n \n So you are to love yourself first, you can not conclude Jesus expected a person who disliked themselves would be justified by scripture to dislike eveyone else. So loving yourself despite what you are, which is a sinner and you always will be, you manage to get through each day without throwing your miserable carcass in fronnt of a train. You manage to accept what you see as your failings even though they persist and some of which are the result of nothing intentional just who you are. God, we are told accepts those short comings, he may not like them but he gets over it, which is not to say he condones it, but it isn't enough in his eyes to have held back salvation for everybody who wants it. This includes you being a sinner. So if you can love yourself despite your sins and Jesus expects others to love you despite your sins and you claim to respect Jesus as your Lord why do you disregard his commandment to love your neighbor as your self because your neighbor happens to through no fault of his own be gay? I don't suppose you purposely go out and sin, but you do because it is who you are. Jesus never says anything about gay people, he never says, even when angered speaks of a particular group as being ineligible, well actually he says stay away from the Gentiles, but we will just pretend he didn't mean it. When Jesus says love your neighbor did he condition it on a certain type of behavior or belief? No because if he did you would still be worshiping one of a dozen different Gods sacrificing goats in the mountains and leaving corn nuts around the tree in your front yard.\n \n Now if you don't love yourself and think because a sinner is who you are and understanding Jesus in a way that makes you better than someone else then you have the correct attitude and can disregard all the above and I will see you in the pit save me some marshmallows. Otherwise do what your Lord told you to do the way he told you to do it and stop whining. I am sure Jesus somewhere spoke about judging others, something about it being God's responsibility and not in your job description. Remember Genesis man was made to be the gardener in Eden so don't get ahead of yourself, ther sport.",

   "hi proudmom, welcome to the forums.\n \n i think the bible is pretty clear that homosexuality is wrong, in the new and old testament. however, by modern day society's standpoint, about 50% of what the bible says is wrong, morally, so to base your life, worldview, opinions, arguments etc. on the bible in the literal sense, would be contributing to mass hatred among other hideous things. what i, and the other freethinkers on this board try to do is show people that the bible is not a valid resource for opinions. in the same way homosexuality is wrong in the bible, many other teachings are ignored by religious people on the basis that society has moved on. for some reason, the biblical teachings on homosexuality still rage to this day. i hope soon that opinion will be thrown into the vault of things-in-the-bible-religious-people-dont-believe-in-anymore with the other opinions such as selling your daughter to slavery and stoning children to death if they are disobedient.\n \n these are just my personal opinions, that if i were to have a gay son or daughter, i would definitely not turn to the bible for answers. nor would i teach him to repent his sins based on what the bible says - assuredly this means turning him from gay to straight... which is laughable.\n \n EDIT also, keep in mind this: read the things Easyrider says. they dont actually refer to homosexuality, but strictly gay sex. with your experience, you would know as well as anyone that that's not what homosexuality is. so that being said, my first statement - the bible is clear that homosexuality is wrong - may not even be correct. its gay sex the bible doesnt like.\n\n \n what?? lol. The Bible teaches against \"unatural relations\" the romantic desires between people of the same sex, God created male and female to become one flesh when they fall inlove and get married, that is why it is only male and female who can make children. You cant make a child with only sperm (two men having sex) or with only female eggs (2 women having sex) It takes both sperm and egg to make a child. That alone should tell you that homosexuality is unatural even if you dont belive the Bible. The world will change, the ways of the world and peoples ideas will change, but the word of God never changes. What will be next, will having sex with animals be legal next and then allowing a human and an animal equal relationship rights??",

   "I think you're ultimately going to defend gay sex regardless of what you see in the Bible, because of your son, but here's some of the scriptures anyway:\n \n Leviticus 18:22 - \"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\" \n \n Leviticus 20:13 - \"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - \"But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine...\"\n \n Jude 7 - \"In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.\" \n \n There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that.\n\n \n I am sorry to step into this, but to be honest, the bible is not to matter to the whole world, and, if the bible can be misinterpreted to match other religions, then why are we listening to it?\n \n ALSO, God forgives us for our sins. HE MADE US THIS WAY! AS HE MADE GAYS. WE SHOULD ACCEPT THOSE WHO GOD WELCOMES AS HIS KIDS, \"Jesus loves the little children, ALL of the children of the world\" Except gays? i think not.\n \n another thing, about the gay marriage issue.. RELIGION IS NOT TO BE INVOLVED WITH LAW MAKING. \"congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercises thereof.\" Thomas Jefferson thought of this as a \"wall of separation between church and state.\" \n \n also, the civil liberties it is denying, which All Americans should have, being equal and all, \"Freedoms to think and act without fear of unfair treatment. \"\n yet, we are being denied to express ourselves freely, which may not be completely stated as part of freedom of speech, but should be. this is because: freedom of speech INCLUDES freedom of music, art, and clothing... so pretty much freedom of expression. freedom of expression should include expressing who we love. and freedom to love should have freedoms to wed to any gender.",

   "Hello, \n \n I am new to this debate forum, actually I have never been on a debate forum before but this site was recommended to me to have good debate regarding homosexuality. \n I have a gay son that I am very proud of but have always had many questions regarding being gay and homosexuality. \n I guess you could say that I was raised with \"fire and brimstone\" but have come around on many issues since finding out my son was gay some 20+ years ago. \n I still have serious questions about what the Bible does say or doesn't say about homoseuxuality and the nature of it, wether it is truly a sin or not. \n I understand that their are different interpretations of the Biblical verses that seem to address the issue but am confused as to wether fundimentalist Christians are taking this out of context to justify their own views. I was told that if I belived the Bible as the true word of God then I should have no questions but I have many. \n I hope you can be of help. Thank you.\n\n \n \n << Matthew 26 <<\n New American Standard Bible \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------49Immediately Judas went to Jesus and said, \"Hail, Rabbi!\" and kissed Him. 50And Jesus said to him, \"Friend, do what you have come for.\" Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him. \n 51And behold, one of those who were with Jesus reached and drew out his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear. 52Then Jesus said to him, \"Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword. 53\"Or do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels? \n \n \n \n \n \n IT SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT AFTER JUDAS, WHOM YES, WAS A TRAITOR, HAD KISSED JESUS, JESUS HAD STILL CALLED HIM FRIEND. Jesus was not afraid for his father would accept it, his father had set it all up. Judas was all part of the incident, where god had spoke to him also.. obviously god shouldn't be against gays, if he is alright with Judas kissing Jesus.",

   "hello proudmom. thank you for supporting gays.. i would like to say one last thing though,\n \n God made us who we are, we should accept who we are rather than change it.\n times have changed, and god's word will also, but first, we should accept who we are so others can, tell your son that just because other's will not accept certain things, out of ignorance, that doesnt mean we should have to stop living the wonderful life that god has given us. and personally, i may not talk to god, but i know he will welcome us, even if others consider it a sin to show love towards another of the same gender, god will welcome us as his children..\n \n another thing, i believe adam and eve got killed off for not listening about the forbidden fruit on the forbidden tree... so why all this talk of \"adam and eve not adam and steve\"?\n obviously adam and eve did not work out.\n \n and there is over population as it is, the world should be welcoming gays as our saviors, they are saving this world from HAVING to kill off humans. we are to be welcomed into the world. god loves everyone. it is a sin to hate\n 1 John 3:15 \n Anyone who hates another brother or sister is really a murderer at heart. And you know that murderers don't have eternal life within them.\n \n so god does NOT hate gays, he may not be all for them, but does not hate them for their sexual orientations.\n \n A true act of love is treating someone with respect and kindness even though he/she knows you do not approve of his lifestyle and/or choices. It is not loving to allow a person to remain stuck in sin.\n \n so why is it we are not following through on our true acts of love? love is love, no matter what genders, and love, wether physically or emotionally, should be able to be shown.\n love can be between family and friends, showing emotional love and support.\n or towards a lover, this does not change on gender of lovers, but should be able to be shown physically, with the connection outside of households.\n \n yes i understand that straight people may not want to see 2 people of the same gender having intercourse, but we can not stop what is behind closed doors, i do not believe they're doing this in public, so let them be..\n \n the homosexuals of the world have to endure not having a life long partner, and the heterosexuals get to show all of the love they want to their partner.. married or not.\n homosexuals dont even have the option to marry. so they should have the same rights, holding hands, kissing, hugging, making out.\n we have to endure the straight people doing these actions, like making out, everyday.\n yet straights can not even bare to be alright with a peck on the lips from two of the same gender.. unless it is to be some one who is alright with their opposite gender kissing for t.v. or movies.. but never the same?\n \n \n to be honest, i am a 15 year old. and i am bisexual, i prefer girls and am, myself a girl.. at school, i am not allowed to hug or hold hands with my girlfriend, but the opposite gender couples are making out and the school district doesn't say a thing to them.\n \n i am taking a stand for what i believe in, and i have a petition at school.\n even religious straight females and males have agreed and signed the petition that gays should have EVERY right as straights, including marriage.\n my bestfriend is straight and she supports it all.\n \n everyone is just worried about the possibility of being raped by someone of the same gender. but.. in all actuallity, its unfair to make such judgements just based on sexual orientation. \n \n thank you for your time.",

(LGBT) it hurts those who support the LGBT communities also.\n my family raised me to accept and we shall be accepted in return, that isnt the case here... we are accepting straight people. but are not being accepted for who we are.\n \n i am sorry, but i honestly think that this world is just trying to start wars and get what certain people want.. the U.S. is to be equal, and equal it shall be.\n if only every one will accept differences and respect them as well.\n \n thank you two for supporting me, and my decisions. and the facts and statistics that can be proven.\n \n i just wish this world were full of peace rather than war. thats what the U.S. has said we are fighting for, but first, we should make peace a part of the U.S. instead of worrying about other countries. our world does need more peace. our society needs more respect. and our people need more acceptance.\n i am just proving this information.\n \n thank you for your time.

Do you expect us to remain in the closet and let the ignorant continue to pretend we don't exist? Where you see attention seeking gays, I see a struggle for equal rights and recognition under the law. I'm not saying all of the tactics they use are right or even tasteful but it remains something worth fighting for.",

   "what?? lol. The Bible teaches against \"unatural relations\" the romantic desires between people of the same sex, God created male and female to become one flesh when they fall inlove and get married, that is why it is only male and female who can make children. You cant make a child with only sperm (two men having sex) or with only female eggs (2 women having sex) It takes both sperm and egg to make a child. That alone should tell you that homosexuality is unatural even if you dont belive the Bible. The world will change, the ways of the world and peoples ideas will change, but the word of God never changes. What will be next, will having sex with animals be legal next and then allowing a human and an animal equal relationship rights??\n\n \n sorry, i missed this.\n \n you wanna talk about nature? hi there, im a zoology student, i know quite a bit about the natural world. there are thousands of recorded instances of homosexuality amongst vertibrate animals, you should see bonobos go at it. dolphins penetrating each other's blowholes, kangaroos, spider monkeys...\n \n something interesting, though. homosexuality is quite natural, however homosexual individuals who have sex with members of the same gender only is strictly a human attribute. thats exactly why im convinced that homosexuality is not genetic, something in our personal development must be causing it.\n \n your argument is the same as EZ's, gay sex is wrong, but no word on homosexuality. since weve already explored that gay sex is actually quite natural, your argument gets the boot.",

Further the term often implies that this supreme being does not intervene in human affairs or suspend the natural laws of the universe. Deists typically reject supernatural events such as prophecy and miracles, tending to assert that God (or \"The Supreme Architect\") has a plan for the universe that is not to be altered by intervention in the affairs of human life.

   " I grow sick hearing things like this.. Christian Zealots everywhere Spouting that this Country was founded on Religion as a Nation under God.. Well You Are Dead Wrong. \n\n \n No, you are dead wrong.\n \n Whatever America has evolved into today is a separate issue from what America was in the days of the American Revolution. Where did America's great strength lie then? And what were the moral foundations of America at its inception? The evidence is overwhelming: the founding fathers tell us that our nation was conceived on the principles of the Biblical God and Christianity. Not on Hinduism, not on Humanism, nor Buddhism, nor the writings of Confucius or Islam, or even Deism, but founded on Biblical and Christian principles. \n \n Here are just some of the facts that are seldom taught in America's public school classrooms:\n \n The most frequently recognized source for political inspiration for the founding fathers was the Bible, which was referenced in some 34% of the founding father's quotations.\n \n The first reference to God as the foundation of an American colony was noted in the 'Mayflower Compact,' dated November 11, 1620:\n \n \"....Having undertaken for the Glory of God, and advancement of\n the Christian faith, and the honour of our king and country, a\n voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia;\n Do by these presents, solemnly and mutually in the presence of\n God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together\n into a Civil Body....\" \n \n Many of the founding fathers recognized that the principles of civil law were inseparably linked to Biblical truths. James Wilson, one of the original Supreme Court Justices, and a signer of the Constitution, explained,\n \n \"Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine...Far from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants...\"\n \n On a number of occasions, the United States Supreme Court specifically recognized America as a Christian nation. In the case \"Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States\" (Feb. 29, 1892, US457-458), Justice Josiah Brewer, following a lengthy and exhaustive search of early American historical literature, commented, \"We find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth....that we are a Christian nation....\"\n \n In another Supreme Court Case, \"Zorach vs. Clauson\" (1952, US306 307 313), Justice William O. Douglas categorically stated, \"We are a religious people and our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.\" Further, in \"United States vs. Macintosh\" (1931, 283 US 605, 625), Justice George Sutherland affirmed, \"We are a Christian people....affording to one another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledge with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God.\"\n \n At the Constitutional Convention on June 28, 1787, Benjamin Franklin noted: \"...The longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that 'except the Lord build the House, they labor in vain that build it.\"\n \n There are many today who believe Franklin was a strict deist, but Franklin here is not only referencing the Bible, but is alluding in part to a teaching by Jesus Christ from Matthew 10:29.\n \n Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution, John Quincy Adams noted, \"The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity.\" \n \n In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: \"The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence were...the general principles of Christianity.\"\n \n Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said, \"The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ and His Apostles...This is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free constitutions of government.\" \n \n Time after time, the founding fathers declared similar beliefs. From the archives of Patrick Henry's personal notes (handwritten on the back of his copy of the \"Stamp Act Resolutions,\" made public after his death) we read:\n \n \"Whether this (new government) will prove a blessing or a curse \n will depend upon the use our people make of the blessings which\n a gracious God hath bestowed on us. If they are wise they will be\n great and happy. If they are of a contrary character, they will be\n miserable. Righteousness alone can exalt them as a nation.\" \n \n Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said: \n \n \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have \n removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the\n people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.\" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)\n \n \"I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we\n are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their\n native land and planted them in a country flowing with all\n the necessities and comforts of life.\" (Monday, March 4,\n 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address)\n \n Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise. \n \n Speaking of Godly principles, Jefferson stated:\n \n \"A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never\n seen; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian,\n that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus.\"\n (Jan. 9, 1816 - In a letter to Charles Thomson)\n \n George Washington, the \"Father of our Country,\" likewise recognized God as supremely important in the American dream. In his first inaugural address on April 30, 1789, Washington remarked:\n \n \"It would be improper to omit, in this first official act, my\n fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over\n the universe.\"\n \n \n On Saturday, October 3, 1789, President Washington said this in proclaiming a day of national thanksgiving:\n \n \"It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the Providence of\n Almighty God.\"\n \n Today, our public schools are in a moral crisis. Washington once noted, \"If you remove religious principles from the schools you are going to lose national morality.\" How prophetic he was!\n \n Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the \"Father of Public Schools,\" once had this to offer: \"The only foundation for a republic is...religion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty.\"\n \n Don't miss the significance of that last statement: \"..without virtue there can be no liberty....\" The principle is clear - a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, \"Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings).\" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions.\n \n Still another founding father, the Reverend John Witherspoon, mirrored Benjamin Rush when he declared, \"...Civil liberty cannot long be preserved without virtue....\"\n \n And finally, let's not forget James Madison, known as the \"Chief Architect of U.S. Constitution,\" who once had this to say:\n \n \"Cursed be all that learning that is contrary to the Cross of Christ.\"\n \n This is just a very short list of thousands of such examples that clearly speak of the Biblical and Christian foundations of our Founding Fathers and early America. (Righter Report)\n \n \nGet educated and drop religion, we'll all be better off.\n\n \n You're busted.",

   "Hello, \n \n I am new to this debate forum, actually I have never been on a debate forum before but this site was recommended to me to have good debate regarding homosexuality. \n I have a gay son that I am very proud of but have always had many questions regarding being gay and homosexuality. \n I guess you could say that I was raised with \"fire and brimstone\" but have come around on many issues since finding out my son was gay some 20+ years ago. \n I still have serious questions about what the Bible does say or doesn't say about homoseuxuality and the nature of it, wether it is truly a sin or not. \n I understand that their are different interpretations of the Biblical verses that seem to address the issue but am confused as to wether fundimentalist Christians are taking this out of context to justify their own views. I was told that if I belived the Bible as the true word of God then I should have no questions but I have many. \n I hope you can be of help. Thank you.\n\n \n I do know that the bible teaches us consistently and continously to \"love one another\" everything the bible say boils down to that.... It does not say love the straight people. My son is also gay and I love God with all my heart and I knew he was gay from a very early age.....I struggled with that a long time ago because of what the hate mongers say and use Gods name to say it....the bible is very clear on what was relavent at the time and there are specific reasons why certain things were taught at certain times...is incest ok??? I dont believe so and yet it is in the bible....I am not a bible scholar and I am sure I dont read it enough but I am equally sure that God loves all people and He died for all people and to teach otherwise is truly an abomination to God and makes a mockery of His death!

If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector .\"\n\n \n \n Actually Matthew says work it out amongst yourselves and involve the church as a last resort. It gives no authority to do anything other than act as a mediator. \n \n You may want to consider that Roman law was unpopular with Jews and who were encouraged not to participate in it.\n \n \nGod commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\"\n\n \n Jesus says how to recognize a false prophet. Read the Bible it helps when you make statements like this.\n \n \n \nSaints of Christ will judge the world, and angels:\n \n I Corinthians 6:2: \"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:3: \"Do you not know that we will judge angels?\"\n\n \n \n Would that not imply that the decision has not yet been made? If I am Satan's judge why should I fear him? \n \n \n \nJesus condemned the teachers of the law and the Pharisees:\n \n Matthew 23:27-28: \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\"\n\n \n Now that is a prophetic verse. Jesus describing the leaders of his unfounded church\n \n \n \nJohn the Baptist rebukes King Herod for adultery and other sins:\n \n Luke 3:19: \"But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\" \n\n \n \n I think the idea of him being a rebel preaching about the corrupting influence of Rome had more to do with it than anything else. The fact that his actions started a war, killed sons, poisoned people got divorced would suggest he had a lot more issues than adultry.\n \n \nStephen rebukes the Jewish leaders:\n \n Acts 7:51-53: \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit! Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\" \n\n \n \n Find me a death row inmate who hasn't had a few words for his judge\n \n \nJesus rebukes the Christ-deniers:\n \n Jesus said to them, \"If God were your Father,\n \n \n If God were my father I would be Jesus. Since I am not that means .......\n \n \n \nyou would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me. Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires.\n \n \n He shouts with a quivering lip and stamping his feet as he walks away.\n \n So if you don't believe me it is because your a child of the Devil\n \n \n \nHe was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!\" - John 8:42-44\n\n \n \n According to the Bible that is wrong. If you or the Gospel writers had read Job and had common sense this would be obvious. Ironic how he defends his words as being true by making false claims.\n \n \n \nAlso note all the Old Testament prophets who condemned sin and corrupt moral leadership, and who were persecuted for their discernment and duty.\n\n \n Which ones? What happened to them? What chapter verse?",

   "Here is what is says about a God approved same sex couple. God loved David \n \n Would Jesus Discriminate? - David loved Jonathan more than women\n \n \n \nThe author of 1 Samuel tells of a man named Saul, who became king over Israel and fathered a son named Jonathan. David, who was a shepherd from the smallest of the tribes of Israel, came to the attention of Saul and Jonathan when he volunteered to fight a giant who was troubling their nation. The text tells us David was not afraid because he believed God was on the side of the Israelites. In a show of courage, David fought the giant with only a sling shot and a handful of pebbles. Miraculously, he was victorious. Saul was intrigued by this courageous young man, and so he called David to come talk to him, which brings us to Exhibit A. The text says:\n \n \n \"When David had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was bound to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. Saul took him that day and would not let him return to his father's house. Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul. Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that he was wearing, and gave it to David, and his armor, and even his sword and his bow and his belt.\" (1 Samuel 18:1-4)\n \n Now, imagine if this story had been about Jonathan and a woman. Suppose the author had written that \"Jonathan's soul was bound to Mirriam, and Jonathan loved her as his own soul.\" And suppose that upon meeting Mirriam for the first time, Jonathan immediately gave her all his most precious possessions. (The armor and weapons of a prince were important symbols of his power and status.) If 1 Samuel 18:1-4 were about Jonathan's first encounter with a woman, theologians everywhere would be writing about this as one of the greatest love stories of all time. The story of Jonathan and his love would be the source of dozens of Hollywood films. But because the object of Jonathan's affection is a man, our cultural prejudice kicks in and we insist (notwithstanding the biblical evidence) that this could not have been more than deep friendship.\n \n This \"culturally correct\" reading will not withstand scrutiny. It asks us to put an interpretation on the story that is completely at odds with our own experience of human behavior. When was the last time you saw a heterosexual man, swept away by brotherly love, offer another man his most precious possessions in their first encounter? Suppose the pastor of your church (assuming he is a man), upon meeting another man for the first time, stripped himself of his suit and gave it to the other. Suppose in that same encounter he also offered his most precious possessions - perhaps a family Bible, a wristwatch with an inscription from his parents, and his beloved four-wheel drive pickup truck. Wouldn't this strike you as more than just a little \"queer\"? Let's face it, the author of 1 Samuel is describing a classic love-at-first-sight encounter that happens to involve two men.\n \n",

Wouldn't this strike you as more than just a little \"queer\"? Let's face it, the author of 1 Samuel is describing a classic love-at-first-sight encounter that happens to involve two men.\n\n \n But we go on there is more to the story\n \n \n \nBut there is more to the story than this one meeting. The text goes on to tell us David became a mighty warrior, and his popularity with the people of Israel threatened Saul's throne, so Saul planned to kill David. But Jonathan warned David, and he fled the palace before Saul could act. Eventually, Jonathan convinced his father to allow David back, but Saul soon planned again to kill David. This time he did not tell Jonathan (he'd learned his lesson the first time), but David was able to escape anyway.\n \n Then Jonathan and David met in secret. Jonathan begged David to come back to the palace, but David was afraid for his life. So they made a plan: Jonathan would go home and try to find out what his father was thinking. If his father had cooled down, he would let David know it was safe.\n \n One night, at the royal table, the subject of David came up, and Jonathan spoke on his behalf. Saul's reaction is Exhibit B. Saul said to Jonathan:\n \n \n \"You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen [David] the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother's nakedness? For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the earth, neither you nor your kingdom shall be established.\" (1 Samuel 20:30)\n \n Many gay men have experienced dinner conversations that sounded very similar to this one. They made the mistake of talking about their lover at the table, and their father became furious. More often than not, the blame goes first to the mother, who was \"too soft,\" or \"too harsh,\" or who \"perverted\" her son somehow. Then the father turns his anger toward the son: \"Can't you see how you're shaming the whole family? Do you even care what this will do to your career? You'll never amount to anything until you give up this foolishness!\"\n In the biblical text, the arguments are the same. And, even more significantly, Saul's reference to shaming Jonathan's mother's nakedness carries a sexual connotation. Uncovering the nakedness of a family member was a euphemism for incest in the holiness codes of the Old Testament, and Saul would not have used this phrase lightly. (See note 1.) The implication is that Jonathan is bringing sexual shame on his family.\n\n \n But wait there is more\n \n \nJonathan immediately ran from the table. And, that night, he went to tell David the sad news. The narrative of their final meeting is full of tragedy and pathos, and constitutes Exhibit C.\n \n \n \"David rose from beside the stone heap and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. He bowed three times and they kissed each other and wept with each other; David wept the more. Then Jonathan said to David, 'Go in peace, since both of us have sworn in the name of the Lord, saying, \"The Lord shall be between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants, forever.\" ' He got up and left; and Jonathan went into the city.\" (1 Samuel 20:41-42)\n \n\n \n yet still more\n \n \nIn the first chapter of 2 Samuel, the author tells us that after Saul and Jonathan were killed in battle, David tore his clothes and fasted, a sign of deep mourning. He wept and wrote a song, which he ordered all the people of Judah to sing. In that song, he included these words, which are Exhibit D:\n \n \n \"Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely! \n In life and in death they were not divided; \n they were swifter than eagles, \n they were stronger than lions. \n How the mighty have fallen in the midst of battle! \n Jonathan lies slain upon your high places. \n I am distressed for you my brother Jonathan; \n Greatly beloved were you to me; \n your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.\" \n (2 Samuel 1:23, 26-27, emphasis added)\n \n Here it is in black and white. David states the love he shared with Jonathan was greater than what he had experienced with women. Have you ever heard a heterosexual man say he loved his male friend more than his wife? This goes well beyond deep friendship between two heterosexual men.\n In this story, we have a direct biblical answer to our question: Can two people of the same sex live in a loving, committed relationship with God's favor? The answer is \"yes,\" because Jonathan and David did, and the Bible celebrates their relationship. \n \n\n \n Wait still more\n \n\n The author feels no need to explain away the love between these two men, putting in a note saying \"this may look like a love story, but no hanky-panky happened.\" When King Saul assumes the relationship is much more than friendship, the author leaves Saul's comments in, and lets the reader assume the same. The author also would have been aware of this story's similarity to other ancient Near-eastern stories that contained homoerotic aspects. (See note 3.) He would have known his story would be interpreted by readers of his time with these other accounts in mind, yet he did not bother to differentiate Jonathan and David's relationship.\n \n Under inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the author of 1 and 2 Samuel wrote this beautiful love story and saw no conflict between it and the earlier Scriptures in Leviticus. How is this possible? Apparently the author of 1 and 2 Samuel understood the Leviticus passage the same way we do, seeing it as a condemnation of Canaanite temple sex which, therefore, had no application to a deep romantic relationship between two men who loved and served the God of Israel. (See Israel's Holiness Code for a complete discussion.) If someone had challenged the author of 1 and 2 Samuel, he might well have responded, \"This is not what Leviticus was meant to condemn. You've got to understand the context in which Leviticus was written. This is a very different situation.\"\n \n Why can't we use the same common sense today? Why are some Christians so determined to condemn what God has so clearly approved in Scripture?\n \n Note 4. The Bible tells us both David and Jonathan married. (1 Samuel 25:39-42; 2 Samuel 3:14; 4:4; 9:3-7; 11:27) This is not inconsistent with a romantic relationship between them. Even today, many homosexual people marry and bear children to conform to social pressures. As a prince, Jonathan would have had no choice but to marry, so as to bear a son to become his heir. David would have faced similar pressures. Other Bible stories indicate David was capable of feeling lust for women. (2 Samuel 11:2-26) He appears to have been what we today would call a bisexual - someone capable of forming a deep romantic relationship with persons of either sex. By contrast, based on what we find in Scripture, David seems to have been Jonathan's only sincere romantic interest. He appears to have been what we today would call a gay man.\n \n \n Remember, David is not some minor hero in the Bible. He is called \"a man after God's own heart.\" (1 Samuel 13:14) He is one of Israel's best-loved kings. He is one of the most prolific writers of Scripture (writing many of the Psalms). He is in the lineage of Jesus Christ. And he loved Jonathan. (See note 4.)\n \n",

This only shows that if EZ can interpret the bible as a book at that hates gay people we can interpret the bible to be supportive of gay people.\n \n Would Jesus Discriminate? - Biblical Evidence\n \n\n Biblical evidence\n \n Can two people of the same sex live in committed, loving relationship with the blessing of God?\n \n As we grapple with this question, we will look at two sets of Scriptures: those that affirm gay and lesbian people, and those that are traditionally used to condemn gay people.\n \n Affirmation in Scripture\n \n On this web site we discuss five passages of Scripture that affirm gay people and their relationships.\n \n These stories, which the writers of the Bible included under inspiration of the Holy Spirit, are amazingly gay-positive. Odds are, you have never heard about these passages and their meaning for sexual minorities. The truth of these texts threatens some of our society&#8217;s deepest prejudices, and their positive messages are usually ignored. It is our hope they will bring comfort and refreshment to many.\n \n Are there really only six?\n \n Given how often some Christians preach against homosexuality, you would think there must be hundreds of Scriptures on the subject. In fact, there are only six traditional (negative) passages, and none of them speaks to the situation of twenty-first century gay people who desire to live in loving relationships with the blessing of God. On this web site, we carefully walk through each of these passages and document what they do and don't say.\n \n Prejudice can influence how we read the Bible -- An example from the recent past. \n In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, young Huck&#8217;s father is thought to be dead, and a woman named Widow Douglas takes him in. Widow Douglas is portrayed as a kindly Christian who takes care of Huck out of goodness, with no thought of reimbursement. The Widow Douglas tries to &#8220;civilize&#8221; Huck, teaching him Bible stories and urging him to live a good life and pray often. She is a loving woman who studies her Bible and wants to always do the right thing. She is also a slave owner.\n \n Later in the story, Huck runs away and happens upon Jim, a slave belonging to Widow Douglas&#8217;s sister, Miss Watson. The sister had intended to sell Jim to a trader in New Orleans. So, fearing he would never see his wife and children again, Jim runs away. He plans to escape to freedom, make some money, and buy his wife and children out of slavery. Huck and Jim&#8217;s adventures as they travel together down the Mississippi make up the rest of the book.\n \n At every turn, Huck finds himself feeling guilty for &#8220;stealing&#8221; Miss Watson&#8217;s &#8220;property.&#8221; He believes he will go to hell for helping Jim escape, and it is clear his Christian education under Widow Douglas is part of the reason he believes this. For all her kindness and goodness, Widow Douglas reads the Bible the same way most of her friends do. She believes slavery is an institution approved by God. She probably believes all African Americans are descended from Ham and the curse recorded in Genesis 9:25-27 demonstrates why they deserve slavery. She sees nothing wrong with buying and selling people because her interpretation of the Bible tells her this is the proper role of those of European descent. In short, she allows her prejudices to mold the way she reads the Bible.\n This may seem like an extreme example. Only the most bigoted Christian would argue today that the Bible endorses slavery or that Genesis 9:25-27 is a curse against Africans. But Huck&#8217;s story illustrates how thoroughly we are creatures of our culture and how that culture can create prejudices that get in the way of what God wants to teach us.\n The information on this site will challenge some of the deepest prejudices of our culture, prejudices that even gay people have often internalized. We will look at Scriptures that dispute some of our most deeply held beliefs, and we must be willing to let God move. In the end, our response will decide if our prejudices mold the Bible, or if we are willing to let the Bible mold us.\n \n The good news at the end of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is that Miss Watson, who always felt guilty for almost selling Jim, freed him in her will. Perhaps she was able to read the Bible with a fresh perspective. Perhaps she listened to the tugging of God&#8217;s Spirit on her soul. Whatever the cause, she and Jim were both finally free.\n \n As you read the pages of this web site, try to set aside any prejudices you may have about the subject. Listen to the Spirit of God speaking through these Scriptures. And perhaps you, like Miss Watson and Jim, will be freed.\n \n \n \n Jesus affirmed a gay couple. Matthew 8:5-13\n \n The Greek word that the Roman centurion uses in this passage to describe the sick man &#8211; pais &#8211; is the same word used in ancient Greek to refer to a same-gender partner. Get more information.\n \n \n Ruth loved Naomi as Adam loved Eve. Genesis 2:24, Ruth 1:14\n \n The same Hebrew word that is used in Genesis 2:24 to describe how Adam felt about Eve (and how spouses are suppose to feel toward each other) is used in Ruth 1:14 to describe how Ruth felt about Naomi. Her feelings are celebrated, not condemned. And throughout Christian history, Ruth's vow to Naomi has been used to illustrate the nature of the marriage covenant. These words are often read at Christian wedding ceremonies and used in sermons to illustrate the ideal love that spouses should have for one another. The fact that these words were originally spoken by one woman to another tells us a lot about how God feels about same-gender relationships. Get more information.\n \n Jesus said some are born gay. Matthew 19:10-12\n \n Here Jesus refers to \"eunuchs who have been so from birth.\" This terminology (\"born eunuchs\") was used in the ancient world to refer to homosexual men. Jesus indicates that being a \"born eunuch\" is a gift from God. Get more information.\n \n \n The early church welcomed a gay man. Acts 8:26-40\n \n In the ancient world, eunuchs were widely associated with homosexuality. Here a self-avowed eunuch is welcomed in to the early church without any concerns about his sexual orientation. He was welcomed on the same basis as other people -- his faith in Jesus Christ. Get more information.\n \n \n David loved Jonathan more than women. II Samuel 1:26\n \n At Jonathan&#8217;s funeral, David declares that he loved Jonathan more than any woman. This is just one of several Bible passages that describe and celebrate an intense love between these two men that went well beyond friendship. Get more information.\n \n \n Idol Worship and Rejection of God. Romans 1:21-28\n \n In these verses, Paul condemns idol worshippers and God haters. According to Paul, these &#8220;God haters&#8221; experiment with gay sex only as a way of seeking new thrills or in cultic worship. Clearly, he is not speaking about innately gay and lesbian people, who love God and want to honor God while living with integrity as who they are. Get more information.\n \n \n Israel's Holiness Code. Leviticus 18 and 20\n \n The chapters that contain these verses are clearly identified as speaking against practices involved in cultic idol worship. The entire passages are generally accepted as not applying to modern Christian life. Get more information.\n \n \n Sodom and Gomorrah. Genesis 19 & Jude 7\n \n The Genesis 19 account of Sodom and Gomorrah is a story of attempted gang rape of two \"outsiders.\" It says nothing about loving gay relationships, and actually condemns the sort of violence sometimes done to gays and lesbians. Jude 7 talks about a first century Jewish legend that the women of Sodom had sex with male angels. Since it is about heterosexual sex between angels and humans, it clearly has nothing to do with gay relationships. Get more information.\n \n \n No Fems? No Fairies? I Corinthians 6:9-10 and I Timothy 1:10\n \n The words often translated \"effeminate\" and &#8220;homosexual&#8221; in these passages are obscure and difficult to translate. The first word identifies someone who is morally weak, and has nothing to do with nellie gay men. The second word probably means &#8220;people who use power to obtain sex,&#8221; though the word is so rare that a confident translation is impossible. Neither word refers specifically to gay men or lesbians. Get more information.\n",

   "They didn't? Where are they, then?\n\n \n I think the point is the trustworthyness of God. Along those lines I would like to add my comments concerning the verse inquestion\n \n 17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die\n \n This is from the KJV stating the day he eats from the ToKoGE he will die. He didn't. \n \n The serpent didn't lie to Eve. The serpent stated that they would not die and they didn't. The serpent said that they would know good and evil like God if they did. Which God confirms has happened when he takes them out of the Garden and away from the Tree of Life because he does not want them to live forever.\n \n And he said unto the woman Yea hath God said Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden 2 And the woman said unto the serpent We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden 3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said Ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die 4 And the serpent said unto the woman Ye shall not surely die 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil \n \n 22 And the LORD God said Behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever 23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken 24 So he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life\n \n I would also like to point out that God placed Adam and Eve in a state of evil and shame. When he made them they were naked and unashamed. Now they eat from The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil and what changes that they are now aware of what good is and what evil is. When God asks where they are Adam says they hid because they were naked, to which God responds asking who told them. Becoming angry that they now knew. As confirmation that God had placed them in sin what does he now do that he did not do before? He makes them clothing. Why now?\n \n God wanted two young naked people completely naive to run around and act as his gardener and play things that was our purpose read Genesis that is exactly what it says period.\n \n But that is not what we are led to believe, because we want it to be something bigger and significant and we want God to be pleased and we need for God to care about us and then need a reason why we hurt and feel afraid and alone so we make it our fault because then we have hope that one day Dad will come back and everything will be wonderful. \n \n God was a bad Dad we were not bad kids and that is the reason he isn't coming back and not because Billy is gay",
