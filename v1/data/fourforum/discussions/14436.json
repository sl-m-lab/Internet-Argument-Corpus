   "Steve, do you think this is a fair challenge? You already know that the two most exhaustive studies ever done on gun control as crime control exists! I know that you do, because we already did this on the gun forum. \n \n Are you trying to pad your position, and make Doc try to prove an unprovable, while you claim neutrality? \n \n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n  What did they find?  \n &#8220;the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&#8221; \n\n They did suggest more studies. Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation funded, the study. Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed\n \n Here is an article about the study Link  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n\n \n \n I hope you don't mind me pointing that out! Sorry if you do!",

   "What did you mean by this? \n \nand have no personal outrage towards either poster.\n\n Who is the other poster you are speaking about?\n \n On the other forum, Doc only tries to cast doubt that CCW has no effect. Heck even the 2 most exhaustive studies ever done on gun control say that much. He is giving his opinion, while others try to build the opposite case! In both cases it is their opinion. The CDC and National Academy of Sciences cannot confirm either position to be a fact. \n   Do Firearms Deter Crime?\n Many Americans keep firearms to defend themselves against criminals, but research devoted to understanding the defensive and deterrent effects of guns has resulted in mixed and sometimes widely divergent findings, the report says. In addition, the accuracy of responses in gun-use surveys is a topic that has not been thoroughly investigated. The committee called for systematic research to define what is being measured in studies of defensive and deterrent effects of guns, to reduce reporting errors in national gun-use surveys, and to explore ways that different data sets may be linked to answer complex questions.\n \n Likewise, new research tools are needed to evaluate right-to-carry laws. Existing studies that use similar methods and data yield very dissimilar findings. Some studies indicate that the laws reduce violent crime. Other studies show negligible effects, while still others suggest that they increase violent crime. It is impossible to draw any strong conclusions about their effects from these studies, the report says.\n \n \n However, and I could be wrong, because no one actually knows what is in anther's mind, but, I do think you harbor some animosity towards Doc, or at least it seems that way to me. Otherwise why would not have issued this challenge on this board. What do you care what Doc thinks.\n \n Personally, if I were Doc, I wouldn't take the challenge because it is a sucker's bet. He would never be able to prove any more than what the CDC and National Academy of Sciences said. Because of the overwhelming power of the names CDC and The National Academy of Sciences, that is going to trump everyone's logic!\n \n The debate may be interesting to some, but the debate is over until someone comes up with conclusive proof that the NAS and the CDC will accept as conclusive! Or do you dispute that?",

   "I am a gun owner, and an avid advocate of gun rights. I don't have a CCW permit. So, please understand that I am not trying to make the case for Concealed Carry. Nevertheless, here is why the effects of Concealed Carry are so hard to quantify.\n \n States that allow lawful Concealed Carry have been increasing dramatically, adding states, year by year. Now   all but two states have legalized at least some form of concealed carry.  \n \n There is a general acceptance of Concealed Carry by police officers, and they believe it is OK. In fact, when asked about accepting other states CCW licenses.\n   Survey Shows Police Support General Recognition of State Issued CCW Permits, \n When the officers were asked if general recognition throughout the states of ccw permits issued by a state, in the way drivers' licenses are recognized throughout the country, would facilitate the violent crime-fighting potential of the professional law enforcement community, 77 percent said yes.\n\n \n   Record numbers licensed to pack heat \n From its beginnings in the 1980s, the &#8220;right-to-carry&#8221; movement has succeeded in boosting the number of licensed concealed-gun carriers from fewer than 1 million to a record 6 million today, according to estimates from gun-rights groups that are supported by msnbc.com&#8217;s research. And while hotly debated, the effect of this dramatic increase is largely unknown.\n \n \n Looking at the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, here are the violent crime and murder rates figures from 1991 till now. Although this says nothing about causation from a ccw prospective, what we can see from these numbers, despite the dramatic increase in the number of concealed carry numbers all throughout our nation, this has NOT lead to an increase in crime figures in our nation. In fact, while Concealed Carry has increased dramatically, both Violent crime and murder has dropped dramatically, to record lows.\n \n   Crime in the United States -- by Volume and Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants, 1990&#8211;2009 \n Violent crime -- Murder rate \n 1991 = 758.2 -- 1991 = 9.8\n 1995 = 684.5 -- 1995 = 8.2\n 2000 = 506.5 -- 2000 = 5.5\n 2005 = 469.0 -- 2005 = 5.6\n 2009 = 429.4 -- 2009 = 5.0 \n\n To add even more facts, while crime has dropped dramatically, our nations stock of firearms has also increased dramatically. The NICS background check system started November 30, 1998. Since then there have been more than 119 million request for background checks.\n   Total NICS Background Checks -- November 30, 1998 - August 31, 2010 \n Total = 119,096,051 \n with about one half of one percent denials. \n \n Are most of these Concealed Carry permit holders just walking around safe neighborhoods carrying their guns in a safe manner, and having little to no impact on crime? For the most part, that is likely the case, because they live in crime free neighborhoods. However who can actually say if a criminal is swayed by the fact their chosen victim might be armed? How can such a thing even be quantified? \n \n One thing can be said by those who carry, at least they have the means to defend themselves of something bad happens. To them, that security and peace of mind is priceless.\n \n That is enough for me.",
