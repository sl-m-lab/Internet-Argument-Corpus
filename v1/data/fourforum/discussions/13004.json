   "\n JULY 20, 2009\n By JONATHAN WEISMAN\n A group of Democrats elected in recent years from some of the country's richest congressional districts have emerged\n as a stumbling block to raising taxes on the wealthy to pay for President Barack Obama's ambitious health-care\n overhaul just as the plan has begun to meet increasing resistance over its cost.\n Friday, two freshmen representatives -- Dina Titus, from suburban Las Vegas, and Colorado's Jared Polis, representing\n Boulder, Vail and some of the tonier suburbs of Denver -- joined Republicans to vote against Mr. Obama's top-priority\n health-care overhaul when it faced a vote in their House Education and Labor Committee. One reason was a onepercentage\n point-surtax on couples earning between $350,000 and $500,000 -- gradually increasing to 5.4 percentage\n points on earnings more than $1 million -- to pay for it.\n The bill passed the committee anyway, but if the number of Democratic defectors grows it could pose a serious\n obstacle to the president.\n Also on Friday a busload of freshmen Democrats went to the White House to plead their case against sharp tax\n increases with the president and his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. The organizer was Rep. Gerald Connolly, the\n president of the freshman class whose Northern Virginia district is the richest in the U.S. as measured by median\n household income.\n \"There could come a time,\" said Rep. Michael McMahon, a freshman Democrat from New York City's borough of\n Staten Island, when Democrats are in open rebellion. \"We will certainly see in the next few weeks where we are going.\"\n Election gains in some of these affluent regions have helped give Democrats big majorities in the House and Senate. Of\n the 25 richest districts, 14 are represented by Democrats, according to Congressional Quarterly. In 1995, Democrats\n represented just five of those districts.\n Recently elected Democrats from higher-income areas also have been cautious about legislation that would make it\n easier for labor unions to organize, and about legislation imposing tough new rules on banks. Republicans have\n savaged the new Democrats for supporting legislation to stem global warming by capping greenhouse-gas emissions,\n then forcing polluters to purchase and trade emissions credits -- a \"cap and tax,\" the GOP says.\n Democrats' New Worry: Their Own Rich Voters - WSJ.com \n\n \n It appears that the blatant socialists in Washington are beginning to rile their own rich supporters with the plan to confiscate an additional 5.4% of their income to pay for have-nots' healthcare. \"From each according to his means, to each according to his needs\" should be the new DNC credo. emoticon_rolleyes",

That's obvious.\n As for proving that being a socialist isn't a good thing, I'll ask you one question. Does one man have the right to claim ownership of another's property?\n Thirdly, the Cold War was as much a war of ideology as it was military might. The USSR launched Sputnik in order to show the world that socialism was the way to go. Kennedy trumped the USSR by pledging that the USA would put a man on the moon.",

I don&#8217;t want the US to become another socialist democracy, do you?\n\n Obama has done a lot to jump start a failed economy.\n \n Too many Republicans are of the indifferent position of \"let it burn\".\n (Unless they could somehow weasel tax cuts into the issue...)\n That attitude cost them.\n \n \n \nSo,&#8221; what the Hell&#8217;s a little more socialism isn&#8217;t going to kill us&#8221; is your attitude? Whatever happened to two wrongs don&#8217;t make a right?\n\n Is Social Security wrong?\n Medicare wrong?\n Socialized education wrong?\n \n In the effort to achieve \"right\", should we end those programs now?\n \n My point is that your assumption of \"wrong\" is based more out of fear than an honest recognition of reality.\n \n The bible preaches that the love of money is the root of all evil.\n Jesus said it was easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into heaven.\n \n But for some reason, a lot of Christians think an economic system based on wanting money will somehow best serve mankind... :xbanghead\n \n \n \nHow does increasing spending by $1Trillion keep costs down? Must be the &#8220;new&#8221; math.\n\n Nice way to try to change the subject, completely.\n There are no health care plans in effect now.\n The previous spending was an effort to get the economy going again.\n Don't confuse the issues (or yourself).\n \n \n \nI find it amazing that when it suits the leftwing agenda, we&#8217;re a Christian nation&#8221; but when the Right says the same thing, liberals scream about our secular nation.
