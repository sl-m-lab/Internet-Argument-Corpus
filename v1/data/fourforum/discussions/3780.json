   "(Evolution means nothing more than change.)\n\n I'm afraid that I disagree. While the denotation of the word 'evolution' certainly does mean change, it also carries considerably more connotations in various contexts.\n \n For example, consider the following definitions from Merriam-Webster:\n \n1 : one of a set of prescribed movements\n 2 a : a process of change in a certain direction : UNFOLDING b : the action or an instance of forming and giving something off : EMISSION c (1) : a process of continuous change from a lower, simpler, or worse to a higher, more complex, or better state : GROWTH (2) : a process of gradual and relatively peaceful social, political, and economic advance d : something evolved\n 3 : the process of working out or developing\n\n These are all legitimate meanings of the word in some limited context. Definition #2 was especially true in Victorian England when Darwin published On the Origin of Species. That is why he objected to the use of the word in reference to his theories. Darwin objected to the implication that his theories implied change in a certain direction or that there was any meaning of change from lower, simpler, or worse to higher, more complex, or better. It was actually Darwin's friend, T.H. Huxley, who made the use of the word popular as applied to Darwin's theories.\n \n You will often see creationists use the evolution as progress argument as a straw man. But when you see the argument that the biological theory of evolution means that something gets better, more complex, or higher, then you can be quite sure that whoever is proposing the argument is being either dishonest or is ignorant of the topic.\n \n Certainly there are scientific uses of the word that fall right in the definitions above. Astronomers and astrophysicists may talk about stelar evolution, but they really do mean the changes that stars undergo during their lifetimes, which are in a specified directiion and may well be from simple to complex.\n \n But the word, when applied to biology, has specific meanings that are not commonly understood by those who do not understand biology.\n \n First, there is the definition of biological evolution. Evolution is a change in the allele frequencies in a population over time. One must understand that alleles are alternate forms of genes, the units of heredity in living organisms. Changes in the relative ratios of these units of heredity are evolution. Also note that individuals don't evolve - only populations; that is, groups of interbreeding organisms. Also note that biological evolution happens over time, specifically from generation to generation. Thus, if someone claims that evolution can't be true because a dog has never given birth to a cat, he is speaking from ignorance. Such an event would disprove evolution if it were to occur.\n \n Second, there are the observations of events that meet the above definition. There are many of these observations. These are the facts of evolution. Changes in the heritable characteristics of populations of organisms are observed frequently.\n \n Third, there are the theories of evolution. These theories explain the mechanisms that cause the changes. We also observe a history of life preserved in the geologic strata, as well as similarities in physiology, morphology, and in recent years, similarities in the genetic makeup that indicate that life has changed through time. The fact that all life reproduces by means of the same organic molecules, using the same genetic code, and sometimes producing nearly identical proteins in very different organisms indicates a common source for life.\n \nA man,a state,a church,a religian that can not change can not grow.\n\n But of course. Growth is a kind of change. But I suspect that certain religious attitudes are that change is bad. They prefer to hold the status quo as it was somewhere around 1600.",

   "Could you expand a bit on that statement.\n\n An individual rarely changes their DNA in a form that will result in a change in phenotype of the organism - a mutation would normally occur in the process of making gametes which only manifests when the resultant organism starts growing. And then, the offspring hasn't evolved either as its DNA has been different from its parents at the mutation site from the start. Probably the easiest way to understand it (though the real reason is that the defition is population rather than individual). Only when you consider the group (at the bare minimum here a population of 2 -parent and child) has any change occured",
