   "Everything I Needed to Know About Smallpox, I Learned in Kindergarten\n \n Much attention should be payed to the Russian Biological Weapons Program conducted out of the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology at Novosibirsk, Siberia.\n \n The 1972 Bioweapons Convention Treaty called for all countries to destroy existing stores of biological and chemical weapons. However, the former Soviet Union actively engaged in the prodution of such weapons. In fact, they had the most extensive program in the world. In addition, the Russians were as belligerent as the the Iraqis in complying with their end of the treaty. They have developed strains resistant to the vaccine, and refuse to give the U.S. a sample so we can create counter-measures. \n \n A reputable source reported that this India-1 strain had been passed to the Iraqis. The Soviets have been producing this stuff by the ton, and have developed a refridgerated MIRV delivery system. \n \n The advantage of using biologicals is that infrastructure remains intact. The disadvantage is that you release smallpox back into the world and could suffer blowback. \n \n Believe me, the Iranians are no angles either. We have a serious problem, because we are faced with a scenario where the ring vaccination method of containment might not work as it did during the erradication, and the 1790's vaccine might not even be effective protection. People joke about the anthrax, but they do not realize that at first their was great concern over whether or not it was a trojan horse meant to look like anthrax, while smallpox silently infected the population. \n \n My friends, worrying about Bush's politics is a non-issue at this point. I don't care who the president is; he should have our support in combating the scientific perversion know as bio-warfare. \n \n Imagine coming down with a cold, accompanied by a dull backache. Redness starts to develop around your face, chest and arms. The rash spreads and becomes pimply. The pimples grow in number and size, eventually becoming large pustules, or they become confluent as a layer of XXXX seperates your skin from your subcunateous layer. You begin to bleed internally and then die. These are the effects of variola major, smallpox. \n \n Now do you understand my concern. More people have died of smallpox than the plague. If you don't trust me, ask the experts in the field. Virtually everyone of them is convinced that a large scale biological terrorist event is inevitable. \n \n Ever read Revelations? I am not a religious man, but I do remember something about a horseman devoted to plague. If smallpox doesn't fit the bill, I don't know what does. I think healthy apprehension and erring on the side of the administration might be wise at this point. Just something to consider. \n \n I justed finished the book \"The Demon in the Freezer\" by Richard Preston. This is true account of the history of smallpox and how it relates to society even now, over twenty years since its erradication from nature. It is a must read for anyone belonging to the human race, and is largely the source of information recalled in this post.",
