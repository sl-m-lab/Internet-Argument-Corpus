   "I have been hearing a lot of people saying that vouchers are unconstitutional because they require taxpayers to pay money for things that may be against their religious beliefs. This seems like a valid argument to me. So, if this is a valid argument than, logically, taxpayers should never have to pay money for things that are against their religious beliefs. It then follows that the government should not be allowed to fund any programs which violate in any way a person's religious belief. So why do I have to pay taxes for the public school system? Public schools generally teach many things that are against my religious beliefs (any sex education program that advocates anything other than abstinence; evolution as a scientific truth or fact) and the money is also used to pay the salaries of people who tell pregnant teenagers to have abortions (and often provides transportation for the abortion) which is also against my religious beliefs. Logically, either I should not have to pay taxes to support the public school system or the public schools should not be allowed to teach those things. Thoughts...",

If the government pays money to send a student to a religious school, this is endorsement of religion.\n \n It is my understanding that a school voucher is just that: a voucher.

This should be a tax refund. Do people agree with this?",
