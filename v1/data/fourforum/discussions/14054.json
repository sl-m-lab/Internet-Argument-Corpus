   "The racist subtext of Southern Republicans:\n AUDIO Of Jim DeMint Saying Health Care Will Be Obama&#8217;s &#8220;Waterloo&#8221; | The Plum Line\n \n Um, unsaid is the old standby of the Old South: Slave Breaking:\n \nOccasionally, Johnson goes over the top in turning slavery into an abstraction. In buying slaves who needed to be broken, he writes, \"slaveholders boasted that their own mastery would inhabit their slaves' every action. Their slaves would be extensions of themselves, the actions of the enslaved indistinguishable from the will of the enslavers. Slave breaking was a technology of the soul.\" Slave breaking may have been a technology, but as much as it became one of the soul, it remained one of broken bodies, of an empirical difference between slaver and slave. Johnson avoids confronting the very concrete reality of slave suffering in favor of some rather fevered analogies. (\"If necromancy was the slave market's magic, race was its technology.\")\n\n \"Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market\" by Walter Johnson - Salon.com\n \n I suppose that, according to the hue of his skin, President Obama is supposed to act in a certain obsequious way. Also, take a look at the Willie Lynch letter:\n Willie Lynch The Making Of A Slave\n \n Willie Lynch, from whom the term \"lyching\" is derived...\n \n Verrrrry interesting. \"It Will Break HIM.\" \n \n Code talk.",
