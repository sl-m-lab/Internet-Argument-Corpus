I myself, will pull out my gun to prevent being assaulted or attacked. My child will never find a loaded gun that he can shoot himself or anyone else with...as they all have locks on them, or are locked away when not on my person, and never kept loaded when not in my direct possession. Law enforcement can prevent some crime through the use of security, and sometimes through lucky timing, stop a crime already in progress, but all too often in this country, law enforcement shows up just in time to write a report about the crime that already took place, or trace an outline on the ground of the body that is already dead. The citizens of this country were granted the right to bear arms for one purpose and one purpose only, to keep the government in check. The rest is incidental, but the value is definately there.",

On an annual basis, the number would be so tiny it would be a meaningless calculation. \n \n ~And regarding the inevitable but-what-about-the-children cry, Lott points out that the number of children killed in accidental shootings is smaller than the number of children killed through bicycle accidents, drowning or fires. Children are also 14.5 times more likely to die in a car accident than through accidental shootings. We aren't, however, likely to ban bicycles, pools or cars.~\n \n From: John R.

Most of the numbers I have found include \"teens\" who are more likely to be shooting each other in gangs etc. Any help?\n \n \n GD answered that one below, but I have a story to share for those eyes that want to hear,\n \n One day my sister and her husband (2Nd) came over to my house years ago for a visit. I had just got back from hunting and had just finished cleaning my guns and was about to put them away. My brother in law looked at my guns laying on the table , snarled up his lip and said with a sharp tone of voice , \" I dont even like to be around those things, I have never had one of those things in my house, and never will. \" ...\n \n \n About a year later, that same bro -in - law had a trajedy strike in his life. His 19 year old son was hanging out at the rural diner one friday night , where the teens sat around on their parked cars and socialized. The police report said that a drunken 19 year old male took a revolver out and was showing it off , waving it around , saying he was going to shoot so and so with it, and laughing. Time went by and the guy started shooting down in the woods recklessly. All of this time my bro - in laws son stays with this crowd. Then, somewhere along the evening, the revolver got mishandled , a .357 mag slug went thru my bro-in-laws 19 year old son's ribcage, killing him instantly.",
