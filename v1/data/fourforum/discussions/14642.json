   "The Democratic Party has decided to wait until after the elections to vote upon the tax cuts.\n \n I fully support Obama's position that we cannot afford to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest taxpayers. I'd prefer that the discounted tax rates for long term capital gains incomes be eliminated and replaced with more populist tax cuts.\n \n Since 1959 after leaving the service, I've voted in every general election and have missed very few primary elections. I will wait until the tax bill is brought to the floors of both U.S. Congressional houses and is brought to a floor vote in the House of Representatives before I vote in a general election. \n \n This is my 74th year. Finally in 2008 I stopped voting for the least evil and determined that I require a candidate at minimum substantially concur with my opinion upon at least one issue and methods to achieve our perceived goal. I won't absolutely always vote for a candidate that simply only meets my minimum standard. \n \n Obama's speaks well on the issues but lacks explicit explanation of how he prefers the laws should be drafted to achieve specific goals. His campaign office has written, (but I've never actually found a direct quote from Obama), that he was a proponent of the federal minimum wage tied to a cost of living adjustment, (i.e. COLA). Based upon that minimal but substantial agreement I voted for Obama. I fear that true to his normal behavior, Obama and the Democrats will acquiesce to Republicans. If the minimum is increased, The Democrats will not press for it being thereafter COLA'd. \n \n A COLA'd minimum wage rate will not substantially improve USA's economy but it is certainly an improvement of a non-COLA'd minimum wage. Any significant federal minimum wage is preferable to an ineffective minimum wage. I suppose it is feasible for a minimum wage rate to be excessive and detrimental to an economy. The greater harm occurs within jurisdictions adjoining others having inadequate wage scales and goods and persons have unrestricted passage over their borders. I have never encountered a historical reference to a nation's economy being harmed by an excessively great minimum wage. I don't believe there's ever been an excessive minimum wage within any nation.\n \n Obama is the titular head of the Democratic Party. Obama and our nation were lucky he achieved anything. It was due to chance rather than political competence that gave our nation comparatively less superior health insurance legislation. I am not angry because of what he and his party failed to achieve. I'm furious of what positions he surrendered without fully negotiating for anything better. Politics is not a dirty word and negotiation is respectable. Acquiescence and submission are despicable words and are generally cowardly and despicable acts.\n \n It is my patriotic duty not to vote for a party that leads in the wrong direction or a second party that lacks leadership and has no definite direction. The Republicans will lead us until we recognize that it's the wrong direction. Retaining no consistency of direction, Democrats will are unable to correct our nation's course.\n \n I will not vote for any Democrats until Obama and his party finds and retain some courage. Thus far it appears that I will not vote for Obama in 2012.\n \n Respectfully, Supposn",

   "GOP war spending put us in debt | Letters to the Editor\n \n\n In the 20 of the past 30 years the U.S. has had a Republican president. Yet, living in a conservative region, all I hear is how it is the Democrats fault for overspending. What about the trillions of dollars Republican presidents have spent on wars?\n \n &#61549;&#61486;The Cold War - Reagan\n \n &#61549;&#61486;Desert Storm - Bush Sr.\n \n &#61549;&#61486;Iraq War - Bush Jr.\n \n &#61549;&#61486;Afghan War - Bush Jr.\n \n &#61549;&#61486;The most expensive war of all\n \n &#61549;&#61486;The Drug War - Reagan\n \n Nobody seems to include the cost of these wars when finding reasons why America is in debt. Instead we hear from the conservatives how Obama's stimulus bill and over spending got us into this mess, really? He has been president for less than two years!\n\n \n \n When Clinton took office in 1993 the Debt/GDP was at 66.1% at the end of his first term the Debt/GDP was at 65.4% .. a -0.7 % decrease in national debt. at the beginning of his second term in 1997 the Debt/GDP was at 65.4% at the end of his second term the Debt/GDP was at 56.4 % another 9.0% decrease in national debt...\n \n then it gets really bad when Bush is elected... check the numbers..\n \n when bush took office 2001 the Debt/GDP was at 56.4 % by the end of his first term the debt/GDP was at 63.5%.. a +7.1 Increase in national debt. and it continued to rise. by the end of Bush's second term the Debt/GDP was a whopping 83.4 % an increase of +20.0 %.. and higher than it had been in more than 50 years... \n \n Obama inherited a 83.4 % debt/GDP .. he didn't create this mess. If we're lucky by the end of his first term we will see the debt start to go down again. The Problem is that most Conservatives would rather cast blame on a Democrat than to admit that the Republican party is the one spending like there's no tomorrow. Once the Bush Tax cuts are reversed in January you will see a turn around in the economy. A 3 % increase to the richest 2 % of the country isn't going to cause anything except healing what Bush has destroyed over his 8 years .
