Deutsch, the young presidential appointee at NASA who told public affairs workers to limit reporters' access to a top climate scientist and told a Web designer to add the word \"theory\" at every mention of the Big Bang, resigned yesterday, agency officials said. \n \n Mr. Deutsch's resignation came on the same day that officials at Texas A&M University confirmed that he did not graduate from there, as his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on file at the agency asserted.\n \n Officials at NASA headquarters declined to discuss the reason for the resignation. \n \n \"Under NASA policy, it is inappropriate to discuss personnel matters,\" said Dean Acosta, the deputy assistant administrator for public affairs and Mr. Deutsch's boss.\n \n The resignation came as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was preparing to review its policies for communicating science to the public. The review was ordered Friday by Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, after a week in which many agency scientists and midlevel public affairs officials described to The New York Times instances in which they said political pressure was applied to limit or flavor discussions of topics uncomfortable to the Bush administration, particularly global warming.\n \n \"As we have stated in the past, NASA is in the process of revising our public affairs policies across the agency to ensure our commitment to open and full communications,\" the statement from Mr. Acosta said. \n \n The statement said the resignation of Mr. Deutsch was \"a separate matter.\"\n \n Mr. Deutsch, 24, was offered a job as a writer and editor in NASA's public affairs office in Washington last year after working on President Bush's re-election campaign and inaugural committee, according to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. No one has disputed those parts of the document.\n \n According to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Mr. Deutsch received a \"Bachelor of Arts in journalism, Class of 2003.\"\n \n Yesterday, officials at Texas A&M said that was not the case. \n \n \"George Carlton Deutsch III did attend Texas A&M University but has not completed the requirements for a degree,\" said an e-mail message from Rita Presley, assistant to the registrar at the university, responding to a query from The Times.\n \n Repeated calls and e-mail messages to Mr. Deutsch on Tuesday were not answered.\n \n Mr. Deutsch's educational record was first challenged on Monday by Nick Anthis, who graduated from Texas A&M last year with a biochemistry degree and has been writing a Web log on science policy, scientificactivist.blogspot.com.\n \n After Mr. Anthis read about the problems at NASA, he said in an interview: \"It seemed like political figures had really overstepped the line. I was just going to write some commentary on this when somebody tipped me off that George Deutsch might not have graduated.\"\n \n He posted a blog entry asserting this after he checked with the university's association of former students. He reported that the association said Mr. Deutsch received no degree.\n \n A copy of Mr. Deutsch's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was provided to The Times by someone working in NASA headquarters who, along with many other NASA employees, said Mr. Deutsch played a small but significant role in an intensifying effort at the agency to exert political control over the flow of information to the public.\n \n Such complaints came to the fore starting in late January, when James E. Hansen, the climate scientist, and several midlevel public affairs officers told The Times that political appointees, including Mr. Deutsch, were pressing to limit Dr. Hansen's speaking and interviews on the threats posed by global warming.\n \n Yesterday, Dr. Hansen said that the questions about Mr. Deutsch's credentials were important, but were a distraction from the broader issue of political control of scientific information. \n \n \"He's only a bit player,\" Dr. Hansen said of Mr. Deutsch. \" The problem is much broader and much deeper and it goes across agencies. That's what I'm really concerned about.\"\n \n \"On climate, the public has been misinformed and not informed,\" he said. \"The foundation of a democracy is an informed public, which obviously means an honestly informed public. That's the big issue here.\"",

   "1)On March 23, 1993 ...only 11 days after becoming attorney general, Janet Reno called her first press conference to announce that she was firing all 93 U.S. attorneys and replacing them with Clinton loyalists.\n \n 2) The Clinton's purge of the White House Travel Office provides a case in point. Her goal was to free up jobs for political cronies. Instead of dismissing the old employees quietly, Hillary orchestrated a massive smear campaign against them. The FBI, Internal Revenue Service and Justice Department were assigned to dig up dirt on Travel Office director Billy Dale and his team. Dale was prosecuted for embezzlement, his taxes audited, his FBI background file turned over to dirty-tricks specialists in the White House. Only after two and a half years of harassment was this innocent man finally cleared of criminal charges.\n \n 3) The Clintons proceeded to defang the federal judiciary. Between 1994 and 1998, they appointed seven new judges to the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. - all Clinton cronies. The new appointees nicknamed themselves the \"Magnificent Seven\" - a name that stuck until the Clintons appointed an eighth member to the team in 1998.\n The Magnificent Seven scandalized their colleagues by holding closed meetings every month, from which other federal judges were excluded. \"I cannot imagine any legitimate reason for them to meet together once a month, even socially,\" one courthouse official told the Washington Times. Another court official charged that the meetings \"reek with impropriety.\"\n Indeed they did.\n \n Throughout the Clinton years, these hand-picked judges issued ruling after ruling shielding the Clintons and their alleged accomplices from federal prosecutors.\n \n It later came to light that the obstructive activities of the Magnificent Seven had been carefully coordinated.\n \n The Associated Press reported on July 31, 1999, that Carter-appointed judge Norma Holloway Johnson - chief U.S. district judge for Washington, D.C. - had flouted standard procedure by personally and secretly assigning Clinton-related cases to Clinton-appointed judges. Federal cases are ordinarily assigned at random, by a computer. But the Clinton judges followed their own rules. Whatever crimes the Clintons or their operatives may have committed, they now had little to fear from the law. \n\n \n \n Need we get into the people Clinton Pardoned?",
