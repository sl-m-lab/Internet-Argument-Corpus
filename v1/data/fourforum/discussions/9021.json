   "Can someone fill me in here? How can antiabortionists be suggesting something so absurd?\n \n \n http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/la-na-abortion9oct09,1,3865842.story\n \n \nSIOUX FALLS, S.D. - In the fight to preserve the toughest abortion ban in the nation, the talk is not of a fetus' right to life. It's of a woman's right to motherhood.\n \n Antiabortion activists here deliberately avoid the familiar slogans of their movement. They don't talk about the \"murder of innocent babies\" or quote the Bible on the sanctity of life. Instead, campaign manager Leslee Unruh has taken what she calls a feminist approach, arguing that legalized abortion exploits women and - for their sake - must be stopped.\n \n ADVERTISEMENT\n The bumper stickers and T-shirts that fill campaign headquarters spell out her message, in pink and blue: \"Abortion Hurts Women.\"\n \n \"We women buy the choice line. We're panicked, or we're being pressured, or we're ashamed to have a child outside marriage,\" Unruh said. She speaks from personal experience; she had an abortion nearly 30 years ago and said her life since has been darkened with regret and longing. \"If you don't do your job right as a mother,\" Unruh asked, \"what good is everything else?\"\n \n Abortion-rights supporters call such rhetoric patronizing and presumptuous; they say many women find that ending unwanted pregnancies brings relief and the freedom to pursue other dreams. But they acknowledge that Unruh's tactic is effective - and that it has thrown their campaign off balance.\n \n \"Historically, this debate has been focused on fetal rights, fetal life. We have a lot of language about that,\" said Sarah Stoesz, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota and North and South Dakota. \"This adds an element we're not accustomed to. It's a different line of debate.... And that is something we struggle with politically.\"\n \n The ban, passed overwhelmingly by the South Dakota Legislature in February, makes it a felony to help any woman terminate a pregnancy at any stage, unless an abortion is necessary to prevent her death. Women would not face criminal charges, but their doctors could get up to five years in prison.\n \n Rather than challenge the law in court, Planned Parenthood chose to put it to a public referendum, gambling that people would vote to repeal it on Nov. 7. (South Dakota law permits interest groups to refer legislation to the ballot if they can collect enough signatures.)\n \n If voters reject the ban, abortion-rights advocates hope it will deter states such as Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Georgia and Rhode Island, which have been considering similar measures. If the ban is upheld, Planned Parenthood will challenge it in court. Antiabortion leaders would welcome that battle. They hope the U.S. Supreme Court will use the case to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling that found a constitutional right to abortion.\n \n Both sides call this election crucial and are putting out urgent appeals to raise millions of dollars for the fight.\n \n But if this is the frontline of the abortion wars, the guns sound oddly muted. \n \n Attuned to the values of this very conservative state, abortion-rights activists have decided not to make a stand on a woman's right to choose. The big poster outside their campaign headquarters makes a much milder point: \"This law simply goes too far.\" One of their TV ads starts out: \"South Dakotans agree, honor and protect human life.\" The ad goes on to affirm support for reducing the number of abortions, but argues that the law is too inflexible.\n \n The only exception in the law states physicians will not be prosecuted for procedures \"intended to prevent the death of a pregnant mother.\" Even then, however, doctors must try their best to save \"the life of her unborn child.\"\n \n A provision allows women to use the morning-after pill, which can prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of sex. But under South Dakota law, pharmacists are not required to dispense the pill - or refer women to a pharmacy that will. And the Legislature has repeatedly voted down a bill to require emergency rooms to stock the contraceptive.\n \n Walking a neighborhood of gracious homes the other day to rally voters against the law, Emma Tupper, 20, made just one pitch, again and again. \"Our main concern is the lack of exception for rape and incest,\" she said. Some residents nodded and pledged to vote against the ban. Nearly as many politely said they would support it.\n \n \"Even if there's no exception for rape and incest?\" Tupper asked one elderly man.\n \n \"I've looked at the bill pretty closely, and I feel comfortable with my decision,\" he replied, and closed the door.\n \n Tupper - who came from Seattle to work on this campaign - walked on, crunching through drifts of yellow leaves. \"It's a tough state,\" she said.\n \n An independent Mason-Dixon poll in June found voters opposed to the ban, 47% to 39%. But a Zogby International survey last month, commissioned by an antiabortion group in Washington, D.C., found that gap had narrowed to 47% to 44%. In another unsettling sign for abortion-rights supporters, four Republican state senators who opposed the ban lost their seats in the primary election this summer.\n \n \"I don't know if I want to say we have a lot of momentum,\" said Jan Nicolay, a former Republican legislator working to overturn the ban.\n\n \n Like they said in the article, you can have a campaign against marrige because it hurts women because of domestic abusers, you can say the baseball hurts men, because many of them get hurt. But most of the time its a great thing. Why then, would you suggest something so abusrd as to abortion hurts women. Most of the time, abortion lets women let go of that big weight thats holding them back and prusue their dreams, and live a happy life. Since when has AntiAbortionists cared about women?

I don't think that life starts until the child is conscious, so this might not be the case all of the time. The regret after an abortion is probably worse because it it not reversible and the mother will never see their child or even know what they looked like.

Lets see, my child living happily with a family or me child being cut up into pieces and pulled out of my vagina? Hmmm, that's a hard choice. Obviously not all children will be adopted but I bet that 99% of kids put up for adoption at birth are adopted. Which is really worse? If the mother wanted to kill the baby, after birth, how is it different from late-term abortions? The sad part is that you don't equate the two.\n \n \nYou want to humiliate women by putting their name on a list.\n\n \n Yep, it may be childish but that's how I feel. It would only apply to those who have abortions because of a lack of responsibility. I would also never want to be in a relationship with a woman who has done this, that list would make it easier. Should they be proud of their actions? Shouldn't the regret it?\n \n \n Abortion and sex are private matters, there should be no \"lists\". I think we're a bit smarter than that.\n\n \n I must be dumb then. How do you feel about child abuser lists then? It's private and has to do with sex, that's the only parameters you used to decide that a list was not justifiable.\n \n \nThe same thing may happen if its up for adoption, she may spend years of her life searching for her child. I'm no mother, but i think knowing you have a child out there in someone else's hands is even worse. But like i said, they should be given a choice.\n\n \n Guess what, at least she knows they are still alive. She doesn't have the option of finding her child if she gets it killed. You really think that it is worse to know that your child is being raised by someone else than to know that you had them killed and will never be able to see them?",

   "No - ensuring pregnant women's needs are met is the only way to possibly prevent abortion. Anything else is just a way for lifers to feel good about themselves and believe thay will get to heaven faster. Lifers trivialize the circumstances of women to justify attempting criminalization, I don't believe for a second that they will stop doing so once/if it is criminalized.
