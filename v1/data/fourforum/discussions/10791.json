   "British Teen Driven To Suicide Over Gay Taunts\n by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff\n \n Posted: January 10, 2008 - 1:00 pm ET gay.com\n \n (London) British police are investigating the suicide of a 14-year girl who had been subjected to constant bullying by classmates who called her a lesbian.\n \n The body of Belinda Allen was discovered by a man walking his dog in Southwater. Police said the teen had tied a scarf around her neck and hanged herself from a tree.\n \n It is not known if the girl identified as being gay but she had suffered taunting and bullying for more than a year friends said on Thursday. \n \n \"I knew Belinda was being bullied, but I didn't know how badly she had taken it. On the outside she was happy and bubbly,\" a former classmate told British media.\n \n This is so sad, and so unnecessary.",

   "Unfortunately, this is common with gay teens in the U.S. as well. Most christians help perpetuate this problem with demonizing gays and are consistently against stepped up protections in school to help protect gay teens from harrassment and gay adults for that matter. I was a victim of constant harassment in school and the psychological consequences are life-long. I made several suicide attempts back then. This story saddens me to know that the harrassment is still an issue after all these years, there seems to be little enlightenment in many minds. These kids that do the harrassing are raised in an environment that says its ok to do this, wether from there parents, church or a combination of both. Things need to change in the minds of the so called \"family values\" minds. Compassion and understanding towards gays is something they don't posess and they will not take any blame for the many teen suicides that happen due to their contributions towards an enviornment of hate.",

Hope you don't mind me asking you to validate them.\n\n \n How about we start with this then go from there. There's plenty more examples that can be put forth. \n \n http://thebellwetherdaily.blogspot.com/2007/08/ohios-new-anti-bullying-law-christian.html\n \n \nOhio's New Anti-Bullying Law: Christian Right Says It Opens Schools To Gay Activists\n \n CINCINNATI (TDB) -- Nothing is much meaner than schoolyard bullies, the apprentice thugs who pick on kids because they are bigger or older. But some Christian right zealots -- the same people who consider the Harry Potter books a form of witchcraft -- have launched a campaign this month aimed at Ohio's public school districts. The goal: Portay anti-bullying efforts as anti-Christian brainwashing because religious people disapprove of homosexuality.\n \n Throughout the coming school year, local boards of eduction across Ohio will begin enacting anti-bullying policies compelled by HB 276, enacted during the last legislative session. The measure was designed to reduce the numbers of schoolyard meanies, including those who pick on kids by using hateful words . Indeed, sticks and stones can break bones. But names can also cause trauma.\n \n Linda Harvey of Columbus, who runs an Ohio organization called MissionAmerica, is urging Christians to stop school boards from putting measures in effect that include gays and lesbians as students who should not be slurred or preyed upon by bullies. She says the \"homosexual activists\" will be out in force.\n \n \"They want to insert language in local districts that was kept out at the state level, adding specific categories about incidents of bullying, including ones for 'sexual orientation' and for 'gender identity.' Why? By adding such categories, any bullying incident over homosexuality becomes a rationale for advocates to stigmatize all disapproval of homosexual behavior as the cause of such bullying.\"\n \n She adds:\n \n \"Next come the social engineering programs recommended to solve this supposed attitude problems, ranging from establishing 'gay' clubs for students, to peer 'watchdog' programs training kids even as young as middle school to report so-called 'homophobe slurs' on the part of their classmates. I am not kidding.\"\n \n So, is it okay to use a slur? Shouldn't a kid who calls another a f-ggot be counseled that such language is not fit for home, hearth or a public school playground in Ohio. Harvey contends the\"f\" word and its ilk are not improper because she knows of no evidence \"that people are born homosexual.' She says that counseling students who use anti-gay slurs would be unfair and harmful.\n \n \"It's a type of discrimination, and it further normalizes the immoral and high-risk homosexual lifestyle.\"\n \n Her commentary appears in this month's CitizenUSA, a newspaper that is distributed in evangelical churches across Southern Ohio. And there is information of MissionAmerica's other goals on its Internet portal, including some interesting reading about Harry Potter as a helpmate of Satan.\n",

Another is a fundamental change at home. Children learn this behavior from their environment. Education is most likely the key to combat the prejudice. Stopping the use of religion to justify this type of behavior is another. Many things can be done, but this would require christians to start behaving like christians and we are far from that at this point in time.",

(If they mean anything more directly, then there's been no evidence given of such a movement in churches to intentionally encourage it, so the claim has no merit.) It may be that some churches indeed do that indirectly and un-intentionally, but this whole idea of contributing to a culture of something-or-another is very subjective--too subjective to able to regulate. It's the sort of thing that you can't quantify, and so it really doesn't fit in a discussion about what schools should do about bullying against gays. Of course culture should always work towards ending gay people getting hurt, or anyone else. Of course culture should always work toward curbing things that would cause bullying. Those go without saying, here, IMO. It's rather easy to say something like that; what matters is the substance. WHAT reforms are there to be and what do they consist of? What should schools do, specifically? Schools can make rules against bullying and enforce them, and they should. But they shouldn't make a rule about bullying gays over and above anyone else who's getting bullied. Anti-bullying measures should be taken no matter what the bullying is over. And how would schools go about determining how to draw the line between gay-bullying and every other kind of bullying? This approach of having classifications of bullying in terms of rules and policies is rife with problems. Not to mention that saying one person's experience of bullying is worse than another could be insultingly presumptuous, to begin with.\n \n \nGays often have the distinction of hiding in the closet (and might not even know they are 100% gay at very at young ages where 'gayness' is attacked when sexuality isn't even overt) to avoid attack.

They might just have a more 'effeminate' sort of personality as a male and get bullied. how would schools deal with indentifying and dealing with THAT in this 'gay-bullying-is-worse' approach?

I'm on board on the preacher issue, the leaders speaking out, and others. I agree, condemnation is bad. But the last sentence I have a problem with. I think the real problem there is with Dan, not so much the other stuff. There's something missing there--there's a leap from hearing about homosexuality destroying the family and then acting violently. There's a problem with someone who would do that, and frankly, if someone is that way, I would think they're going to do it regardless of the issue if something like hearing that homosexuality is destroying the nation causes violent action. It seems to me that someone who would make the leap from hearing that to acting violently on it has something more wrong than eliminating the message--the catalyst if you will--would fix. There are always going to be things we hear in our culture--always going to be negatives about people. I think the problem is that people have to know not to act violently at all--bullying or whatever you want to call it. If someone acts violently upon hearing such a thing, the problem is clearly with THEM, not so much what they hear. Something is clearly WRONG with someone who would make that leap from hearing to violence.\n \n \nAs far as how you handle it: You tell kids that bullying is wrong.

By pretending there is no line of causality between religious belief and the actions of religious believers, you seek to exonerate religion.\n \n You can fool yourself, but you can't fool us. It's Christian activists who agigtate against even the least measures to prevent the bullying of gay students, or those perceived to be gay, in schools. If it weren't for the fact that it's anti-gay bullying that's causing a disproportionate amount of the problem, they wouldn't be so virtuously opposed to measures to curb it. But they like to protect their prerogative of defending religious bigotry. And you like to absolve them of all blame, and point the finger at those pesky, uppity gay activist you love to excoriate.",

   "I would say Christian morality and centuries of consensus on the subject exacerbate the problems that more than likely stem from a machismo attitude found in some cultures where being gay is seen as simply abdicating your mascalinity to become 'girly'...weak and useless... \n \n The many problems I see in establishing qual rights is that of impatience. Many gays push their agenda too hard and thus, you see the back lash.\n\n \n First we get bashed because we're supposedly seen as \"girly\"; then we get bashed for being too \"pushy\" or assertive. Can't win in this world. \n \n \nA better campaign is needed.\n \n I'd suggest forming loathsome PACs and pushing forward charismatic gays during pivitol elections times to get political access to TV ads and simply push the message that you're human too and are normal just like the rest of humanity.\n A simpe commercial would be a bus full of people driving by and several normal people stand up and simply exclaim that they are gay. \n Or one that exclaims gay people buy your merchandise, attend your restaurants and hotels, pay their taxes and are buried next to you in cemeteries and unless you make it your business...you'd never know it.\n Or, one where men are out mowing their lawns dressed nearly identical with a caption reading 'Can you pick the gay man out? Should he wear a little pink triangle so you can?'\n Or maybe children of a gay couple playing with other kids with the caption 'you can't catch gay like you can cooties.'\n Or one of a man in drag and one in cowboy duds with the caption 'One's heterosexual and one's gay can you tell who's who?' With the man in drag wearing a wedding band.\n \n A slogan would probably be along of the lines of 'We're XXXXX, We're Here and you ARE used to us.'\n\n \n You know, this sort of thing gets done. A couple of years ago, in Georgia of all places, Georgia Equality sponsored a series of billboard ads in redneck areas depicting gay people. It was called We Are Your Neighbors, and it was roundly condemned by Christian agitators in the communities it appeared in. Other responses were more positive. Gay groups have sponsored community activities of various sorts, though much energy continues to go into the most immediate problems.\n \n However, this sort of advertising or activity alone, in the absence of a political push, wouldn't accomplish much, because it would have no point, no clear objective. You need the political activism to give it muscle and meaning.\n \n Anti-gay bullying is promoted, defended or ignored by many Christians, and it is just one of the problems faced by gay people while growing up. Trying to say that religion has nothing to do with it is like saying sunshine has nothing to do with plant growth. It's one of the ultimate causes, and because it's so obvious, it can and should be addressed directly.",

   "Let's put the struggle for gay rights into perspective, by looking where we've come from. Box Turtle Bulletin, in a blog post Today In History: A Spunky ONE And The U.S. Post Office, reminds us that Sunday was the 50th anniversary of the first gay rights victory in the US Supreme Court, the 1958 ONE Inc. v. Olesen ruling which forced the US Post Office to permit the mailing of one of the first magazines about gays.\n \n The prevailing attitudes towards \"sexual deviants\" in those days were grim:\n \n \nONE filled a very critical role for gays and lesbians during a very dark time. ONE's debut coincided with a major push to rid the U.S. civil service of homosexuals. President Dwight D. Eisenhower would sign Executive Order 10450 in April of that year, which barred gays and lesbians from federal employment with its \"sexual perversion\" clause. This followed a highly-publicized purge of more than 400 gays and lesbians from the civil service some three years earlier. Homosexuality was criminalized in every states, and it was stigmatized as a mental illness by the psychiatric profession. Gays were not only denounced as security risks, but risks to the very moral fiber of the nation. Homosexuals were treated as subversives, on par with the \"Communist menace\" on which leading politicians were staking their career. The FBI had launched a major crackdown on homosexuality across the U.S., with many gays and lesbians losing their jobs for merely receiving homophile publications in the mail. And vice squads everywhere were setting up entrapment stings in bars and other meeting places, where a simple proposition or touch could lead to arrest and public exposure.\n\n \n The magazine was investigated by the FBI, which wrote to the employers of its volunteer contributors and editors exposing them as \"deviants\" and \"security risks\". That tactic failed, and the USPO stepped in, checking every issue to see whether it was acceptable for the mails. At one point, it held up an issue for almost a month, which provoked this editorial response from ONE's publishers:\n \n \n Your August issue is late because the postal authorities in Washington and Los Angeles had it under a microscope. They studied it carefully from the 2nd until the 18th of September and finally decided that there was nothing obscene, lewd or lascivious in it. They allowed it to continue on its way. We have been found suitable for mailing.\n \n ...But one point must be made very clear. ONE is not grateful. ONE thanks no one for this reluctant acceptance. It is true that this decision is historic. Never before has a governmental agency of this size admitted that homosexuals not only have legal rights but might have respectable motives as well. The admission is welcome, but it's tardy and far from enough. As we sit around quietly like nice little ladies and gentlemen gradually educating the public and the courts at our leisure, thousands of homosexuals are being unjustly arrested, blackmailed, fined, jailed, intimidated, beaten, ruined and murdered. ONE's victory might seem big and historic as you read of it in the comfort of your home (locked in the bathroom? hidden under a stack of other magazines? sealed first class?). But the deviate hearing of our late August issue through jail bars will not be overly impressed.\n\n \n I was particularly taken by the point made in the arch reference to gays sitting around like \"like nice little ladies and gentlemen gradually educating the public and the courts at our leisure\". Had gays acted only that way, the 1950s would still be with us, and we would be afraid to discuss the issue in public.\n \n Eventually, suppression of ONE led to the case based on the Comstock Act that ended up in a unanimous Supreme Court victory for freedom of speech.\n \n So to those who bemoan the alleged \"backlash\" caused by gay activism, let them remember the situation before gay activism. Today's \"backlash\" is nothing compared to that, and being \"nice\" gets you nowhere in politics or civil rights.",

That's been the lesson from civil rights movements going back centuries. And I would like to point out that most of our public relations efforts have been respectful and not outrageous. See the excerpt from the story below. \n \n Gay people and gay groups do participate in civic actions like urban cleanup efforts. We do that already. \n \n I like your specific suggestions for actions. They are creative. I like the slogan too. No doubt such an ad campaign will draw objections. Georgia Equality put up billboards that simply point out that gay people are neighbors. Here is what happened (the direct quotations are in italics): \n \n http://www.gay.com/news/election/article.html?2005/08/01/3\n \n Billboard company rejects pro-gay ads\n by Ann Rostow\n PlanetOut Network\n \n Billboard company Lamar Advertising has rejected a series of ads from Georgia Equality, an LGBT rights group, that were scheduled to appear this fall in rural parts of the state.\n \n The campaign, called \"We Are Your Neighbors,\" features gay men and lesbians in various professions. A gay firefighter, for example, is captioned \"I protect you, and I am gay. We are your neighbors.\" A lesbian doctor is similarly titled \"I care for you, and I am a lesbian.\"\n The first phase of the campaign has been running in the Atlanta area on billboards owned by Clear Channel. But the second phase, anticipated to begin in September or October, is planned for 38 rural counties. Lamar Advertising is by far the largest billboard operator in these areas, although Georgia Equality is trying to find alternatives.\n \n Merely mentioning that we exist, and that we are neighbors, is too strident in the eyes of those who want us to remain completely invisible.",

Read Martin Luther King's famous \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" which was a response to white ministers who told King he needed to slow down, that his movement was \"ill-timed\" and that he should not demand change immediately. People have always told activists for equality that they should go slowly, seek gradual change. It has never been beneficial advice, from what I can see. \n \n Before the rise of immediate abolitionism, the antislavery movement was almost entirely gradual in its approach. Gradual abolition got nowhere. It was only with the rise of an immediate abolition movement that demanded immediate change that things really began to change, and it was the immediate abolitionists who ultimately helped push the nation into civil war, which ended up abolishing slavery. \n \n Gay people have been politely trying to educate people and have been politely asking for acceptance for a long time. The Daughters of Bilitis in the 1950s took this polite, gradual approach. So did the Mattachine Society and the various \"homophile\" leagues. They did important work, but their work needed to be augmented by the more demanding gay liberation movement, which called for immediate change. \n \n The various state constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage were not the result of our movement being \"too demanding.\" They resulted from our movement achieving anything at all. We can expect this kind of backlash even when we are polite, and when we make change gradually. Any progress we make produces backlash. Our opponents don't want to give an inch, even to acknowledge that we exist. \n \n I don't think we have been too demanding. If anything, I think we gay people have been too polite, and too passive, too accepting of our oppression. It's time to say simply, \"Equal rights. Nothing more and nothing less.\"",

And they suffered a lot of violence in return too. \n You don't have the numbers to strike and boycott to put a financial burden on those in power wither. \n \n \nI really can't think of a single example of what you are talking about with regards to \"passive resistance and refusal to participate\" accomplishing anything with regards to gay rights.\n\n It's the tactic of civil rights movements...not the gay movement.\n And it won't really work for you either. \n You need charisma and persuasiveness and at the least a unifid front.\n \n \nI don't think you appreciate the reality of the situation.\n For example, here in California we have a law against gay marriage.\n In the passing of that law, the people against gay marriage EXPLICITLY STATED that it would only be used against gay marriage and not civil unions.\n And the law was passed.\n\n And you then have a small victory. The unions to allow some framework to having the same 'rights' as a marriage. And if those rights don't prove to be equal, you can go back and make another demand. But, you have to allow some time to show that they aren't equal to pass.\n Seperate but Equal lasted decades before it was cast aside.\n \n \nAnd then, the people against gay marriage tried to EXPAND that law's coverage and claim that the \"intent\" of the law invalidated civil unions as well.\n\n And in this case you may be justified for shouting out.\n \n \nI don't think you realize that we get NOTHING by being passive. The anti-gay side is NOT passive, and it is a MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS to lobby against gay rights.\n If we just act \"passive\" and hope that people will see the light, they can't because nobody is showing a light.\n\n Activism the way your doing it now ISN'T working either as a matter of fact, it seems to only have galvanized the opposition that you clearly have shown has more resources and numbers to squash you.\n \n In the past 20 years, gays have gotten a far more positive showing in the media and were gaining acceptance in society. When I was in school, any gays there were in the closet. Now, to go back to it, you have students who are openly gay. Progress was being made.\n Just not at the pace you wanted it to be.\n \n Look, the blacks were enslaved for a few centuries.\n You guys haven't been accepted for far, far longer than that. \n \n \nI agree that has been instrumental in changing the attitudes towards gays.\n But at the same time, in a country where being gay can still get you legally fired in many states, it's hard to JUST \"come out\" cause there are still inherent risks to coming out.\n\n And this goes to show that one battle at a time may be more important to the war over all.\n Working on securing one 'right' at a time. With ensuring you have a means to support yourself seeming more important than a symbolic issue in the marriage issue. \n And I'd hazard a guess that victory was being achieved there with some laws being passed and corporations moving to support same sex mates with health care coverage and benefits.\n \n I just keep getting the impression that many (probably the most vocal) want instant equality (deservingly so) but don't understand realpolitic and other factors of life that make things often sucky.\n Even now, 4 decades after the civil rights movement, not all things are perfect for blacks.\n \n \nQuite frankly, I don't believe in \"back lash\".\n I have yet to see any REAL \"back lash\".\n WHEN and HOW has life for gays gotten worse in this country because of back lash?\n\n You do now have those laws to over come and have lost popularity points.\n \n \nIt's more of a fear than a reality.\n I have yet to meet ANYBODY who actually CHANGED their position from tolerance to intolerance.\n Have you?\n\n Yep. Not in regards to gays but with minorities it does happen. Have no real dealings with them and simply a general tolerant feel and become the victim of a crime by one and you can become quite intolerant.\n Emotion driven behavior.\n \n \n \n \nOhioProf hit the nail on the head.\n Sodomy laws were a huge barrier to gay marriage. \n How could you recognize \"gay marriage\" when consummation of \"gay marriage\" was illegal in and of itself?\n There was no need for laws against gay marriage because \"precedent\" could be cited with sodomy laws and their existence in the U.S.\n \n And when the sodomy laws were overturned by SCOTUS, and gays got that win, THAT is when people started calling for gay marriage laws.\n Because SCOTUS moved gay rights forward and EXPLICITLY stated that laws against homosexuals based on \"morality\" lack sufficient justification to survive constitutionality challenges.\n\n ???\n When were these laws overturned?\n I'm under the impression it happened some time back.\n The requests (movements) for gay marriage didn't happene until recently.\n \n \nActually, the non-violent African American civil rights movement was a \"demand it now\" movement, and they did demand immediate change. Read Martin Luther King's famous \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" which was a response to white ministers who told King he needed to slow down, that his movement was \"ill-timed\" and that he should not demand change immediately. People have always told activists for equality that they should go slowly, seek gradual change. It has never been beneficial advice, from what I can see.\n\n Reread what I've writen.\n As I state the 'demand it now' movement of the civil rights era (cf Martin Luther King) didn't happen until a lenghty history of seperate but equal and other issues had existed for decades. It was a slow build up from their freedom and right to vote until the abolishment of jim crow laws.\n As a matter of fact that movement lasted years before change happened and once it did there were still problems. The dregs of which still exist today. \n \n In some cases your movement would be easier than theirs.\n In other cases, far, far, far more difficult.\n \n You need far more (hetero) support due to your lack of numbers IMO.\n There are many fence sitters out there who are apathetic but once in a blue moon can be motivated to do something. \n \n You need an effective method to get them to either stay home and not be against you OR to get them on your side.\n From what I gather, the slow but steady move to present yourself positively in the media was a success. Just like getting gayness removed as a psychological problem.\n I would have worked to continue that.\n While working to ensure your rights to job and housing security. I would have continued working on the military issue also.\n Once those were firmly secured, then you branch out en mass to another goal until you are treated just as any other human.\n \n I'm sorry that this BS has gone on for centuries and don't mean to sound defeatest or like a bump in the road but you work with what you have and deal with the reality of the situation.\n \n I could even be wrong in my approach but, other than some of the points I mentioned, you don't seem overly successful in achieving everything at once now. And picking your battles may lead to a quicker and more resounding victory.\n \n Just my .02\n Done my way, I'd personally strip everyone of their rights and enthrall all to my god-like will.\n But, that just ties in with megalomania and delusions of granduer sprinkled with evil.\n Muahahahahaahhh...\n ;)",

I believe that error set you back rather than advanced you. Time may tell.\n *as noted, your oppression has existed for far longer than slavery did. Many still ignorantly consider your life to be a choice. Many still consider it against their religious beliefs. You have a steep cliff to climb to over come this.\n *if you had the strength to get into peoples faces to enact change, you'd be felt (boycotts and strikes for example) as it stands, many HAVE pointed out that they see it as annoying and counter productive. As such they will either dismiss you or listen to whomever presents a message that's more receptive.\n \n Already in this thread, I've stated I'm sympathetic and have no problems.\n No, not all are like me.

He catches all 'heteros' in his rants and attacks.\n Hmmm...seems like homos oppose heteros...\n \n You're missing the real important point.\n People act based on emotion or self interest.\n I have no self interest in your cause. You'll find most don't in any practical way. \n Emotionally, is where most issues are delt with for many. Anger them and they'll oppose you until you can calm them down and talk sense.

If you think that slavery was abolished and the civil rights act passed solely because of people pleading that we should be nice to each other, you have a very strange view of history.\n\n Nope, that's what you're mistakenly interjecting into this. \n Slavery wasn't even ended by ANY movement at all but by a political decree.\n It then took a century of stuggle to get to the point of demanding it now...and that was ONLY after several obviously public events of outrage...like Rosa Parks.\n There has to be a build up to get to some sense of popularistic support before you can do the demand it now dance.\n You don't have that obviously.\n History has shown that any group that has prematurely tried this has been squashed. \n \n \nThe push has been steady for decades. If the Jews could survive backlashes, so can we.\n\n Soo...you want to be pretty much loathed in the world and flee to a traditional homeland...which would be where?\n You want to undergo a holocaust of your own just to get the sympathy?\n I wouldn't doubt many would be happy to call their communities 'homo-frie'. \n \n \n\"Lost\" popularity points?

Apply 'heat' slowly until your goal is accomplished is all I'm saying. \n This slow application of 'heat' appears more to do with famous people coming out.

It's just a battle that will turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory for the reactionaries.

They fight for themselves principally, but they are also aware they fight for future generations, who will hopefully be as grateful to them as the current generation of gays is to the activists who made it possible for us to live with the limited freedoms and rights we currently have. Limited they may still be, but it's a tremendous advance on what they used to be fifty years ago.\n \n If we do nothing, however, not only will we not advance further when the heterosexual majority decides that homos no longer care, but we will not maintain the gains we have made. Keeping civil rights in the face of bigotry is a constant struggle. I do not see any opportunity to dispense with activists in the foreseeable future. The least level of activism is to live one's life as openly gay, but make no mistake, every openly gay person has made a conscious decision to allow some activism into their life. Some go on to higher degrees of involvement. \n \n One thing we cannot afford is political passivity, and the more voices raised against us, the more active we have to become in response.",

Is the 2nd sentence about the Pope necessary or constructive to this issue.\n All your doing is personally proving to me that gays are XXXXXX. Is that your goal?\n \n \nYou are showing a lack of understanding of the political process. In the first place, there is no Gay Central which coordinates all gay political activity. People do whatever seems best to them at the time; they take on issues that seem important to them at the time. No-one was more surprised by the success of the gay marriage issue than gays -- it got us on the map like no other since HIV/AIDS.\n\n Unfortunatly, lacking a Gay Central or unifying figure like Dr. King hurts your movement.\n And being on the map can be good or bad. Depends on which way the wind blows. \n \n \nAnd no, I don't see the passage of homophobic laws as a result as a major setback, because that sort of backlash was predictable and predicted, and it is, in the end, self-defeating, because it highlights the injustice. It's just a battle that will turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory for the reactionaries. It has made gay rights a permanent feature of the political landscape, and the reactionaries will eventually lose that debate, just as they lost debates on slavery, ethnic minority rights, and women's suffrage.\n\n You may be right.\n As I said. \"Time will tell.\"\n While I do agree with you that it's inevitable, WHEN will it happen is the question.\n I think with the tactic seen, it'll be later.\n \n \nWe can't control what he watches or listens to. All we can do is put our case forward in public, in the legislatures, and in the courts. Being silent doesn't advance any cause whatever.\n\n You can put your campaign out there where it's seen and operates on the subconscious level. As you pointed out, the campaign to use billboards was stopped with discrimination...why? Because it would be effective.\n \n And, once again, NO one has said 'be silent'. I wish you'd STOP that form of dishonesty.\n I have repeatedly stated to try a different approach that works on psychology.\n \n \nI'd really recommend not generalising about gays. We are as different as heterosexuals.\n\n I can speculate all I want.\n Rather than call it generalization, you should attack or dispell any erronious beliefs or statements made.\n \n \n\n If we do nothing, however, not only will we not advance further when the heterosexual majority decides that homos no longer care, but we will not maintain the gains we have made. Keeping civil rights in the face of bigotry is a constant struggle. I do not see any opportunity to dispense with activists in the foreseeable future. The least level of activism is to live one's life as openly gay, but make no mistake, every openly gay person has made a conscious decision to allow some activism into their life. Some go on to higher degrees of involvement. \n \n One thing we cannot afford is political passivity, and the more voices raised against us, the more active we have to become in response.\n\n \n No one said do nothing.\n It's you who take a subversive campaign to woo support and call it passive.\n Actually, it's a very aggressive campaign.",

They are background strategies, and any movement needs more than those. That's what was being criticised.\n\n I've seen the GA one.\n I will tell you though that in the past 2 years I have seen nothing in the news (I cover the US markets) that would support an active campaign.\n Beyond TV shows and entertainment (background noise) there isn't anything to support such unless if flies under the radar.\n I HAVE seen a discussion about the KKK with the adopt a highway program AND I have seen gays covered who are engaging in the in-your-face activism.\n Part of my JOB is to review how the media presents such segments...positively, negatively, neutral. So far, in the recent past, nothing has been overtly positive. Just NOW, I'm covering a presbyterian lesbian being orgained to minister...the media coverage in CA is neutral.\n Believe me, there would be coverage of gays adopting a highway or other fluff.\n \n \nAnd who never get what they need, because they don't make their needs clear.

As do politicians.\n From body language to music and lighting.\n Presentation is the ONLY thing that matters in the high-tech generation where people watch TV rather than become active or read a book.\n \n You foolishly dismissing this fact shows a lack of eptitude in winning.\n \n \nWhen you cut us, do we not bleed? What more do you need? But we aren't \"just like you\" We are all different, and it is the right to express diversity that is under attack by reactionaries.\n\n Is your blood red? Do you feel pain? \n The only difference is you like the same sex in relationship issues.\n So far, all I'm hearing is you're not like me. Just some alien in human skin.\n \n \nExcuse me? Do you see any dog or child raping around here? Next you'll be asking us to prove we've stopped beating our wives.\n\n Yep.\n You're dealing with an uphill battle.\n You have centuries of bigotry and falsehood to contend with.\n Thus the term 'boogy men'.\n You're pretty much saying you'll always be a 'Them' to me in the Us vs Them struggle.\n The only way to deal with that is to slowly, accuratly work to dispell it.\n And, quite frankly, not everyone deals with gays personally nor has the gumption to ask awkward questions of someone they know is gay to have them dispelled. And not many are going to go actively seek and literature on it.\n You can look to these forums and see the #### some spew about gays.\n And while you might think it's childish to deal with the 'have you stopped beating your wife' type comments, such are thought.\n And while you bring it up, 'Is that why women don't want to be with you and you're now gay? cause you beats on 'em?' emoticon_emb ;) \n \n \nWell, the only person Matt represents is himself, which is true for everyone else here. I doubt he really hates heteros, he's just making a rhetorical point. However, I completely understand his sense of frustration. Sometimes, explaining gay sexual orientation to some heterosexuals, especially religious ones, is like explaining music to the deaf. Not all are like that, probably not even most, but enough to make you feel :xbanghead .\n\n And like the silly sign outside the church...'Sometimes you're the only bible people see.'\n \n Sometimes you're the ONLY gay person people see.\n \n This has a lot to do with simple psychology. If Mr. Blank has no real feelings on the subject but is then accosted by hate, typically Mr. Blank will mirror that hate in return to all who remind him of the event. Not all racism is taught. It may be an inappropriate response but the world is full of misdirected anger.\n There are cases of gay bashing on innocents because the basher was abused himself in the past by a percieved gay man.\n \n During the civil rights movement, who's side won?\n Martin Luthers drive of passive resistance, civility and peace\n Or the ones calling for the opposite approach?\n \n And the peaceful approach often made as many calls to their own for passive resistance to get a unified front and to prevent misplaced retaliation. \n Without that passive approach, it's very doubtful that they'd have succeeded as they did.\n \n And Matt does represent gays. He's a gay activist.\n \n The issue is I, as a non-gay person, ALSO understand his frustration.\n Which only goes to help your side.\n If I can be talked into empathetically placing myself into his shoes and to feel his suffering and irritation, I may be more apt to check the 'gay marriage is the right thing' box on the ballot. \n \n You need friends and allies.\n \n Blacks weren't the only ones marching for equal rights you know.

   "Are you trying to convince me that heterosexuals are XXXXXX? Don't you read what we say? Such campaigns exist all over the place. It's not as though you've been telling us anything new. This strategy has long been implemented. What is criticised is your dismissal of activism.\n\n Answered in past post.\n My JOB is in the MEDIA...Public Relations...\n \n \nA couple of years ago, in Georgia of all places, Georgia Equality sponsored a series of billboard ads in redneck areas depicting gay people. It was called We Are Your Neighbors, and it was roundly condemned by Christian agitators in the communities it appeared in. Other responses were more positive. Gay groups have sponsored community activities of various sorts, though much energy continues to go into the most immediate problems.\n\n A local market is not as effective as a national one unless something pressing is taking place.\n \n \nI was just wondering what sort of schedule you had in mind. Apparently, you aren't willing to tell us.\n\n I've said several times. A decade possibly. Definatly after Bush is gone and hopefully when a liberal admin is in office and controls the House.\n That way you won't have the 'ceiling' come down as effectively.\n Personally, I thought you'd pull the marriage issue off. You had a very good start.\n \n \nWe have to live with reality. We do not have a unified political structure, probably because we do not have cohesive communities on which to base it. We are, literally, everywhere, diffused throughout every walk of life, every ethnic community. Black gays do not experience the same circumstances as white gays, for example. The problems we face are similar to those of the civil rights movement, but our resources and organisation are perforce different. that can't be altered. \n\n And that is a huge obstical. \n As such you can't effectively use their tactics. \n And it'd be a tragedy to have to be liberated from camps.\n \n \nIt's better to be on the map than so insignificant no-one cares.\n\n Oft times true.\n But, hopefully being on the map gets your issues addressed rather than to be noticed as an annoyance and removed.\n \n \nWith your tactics alone, it would be never.\n\n Nope. But continued application of my tactics makes it extremely easy when you do make your requests.\n Like slow roasting meat. Eventually it will fall off the bone.\n \n \nWithout activism to back it up, it would have no effect whatever. The campaign on the subconscious level is endemic -- don't you know gays control TV and Hollywood? Well, I exaggerate, but I am pointing out that your suggestions have been implemented, piecemeal over time and without coordination, but they are going on.\n\n Actually it makes you acceptable and viewed as normal rather as some monsterous beast. It's much easier for me to give in to your demands if I think you're okay and normal.\n As for your 'exageration'. I was thinking that myself previously. I'd state they have done more to help than someone ranting about how life sux and that they should have a right to marry someone of the same sex...especially when I can't do it myself...and if there's a cornel of truth in 'I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry' there may be times when heteros would want to marry each other. ;) \n \n And as to the continuation of these campaigns...that's pretty much what started this tangent. \n I called for a stronger more steady effort.\n \n \nWell, then what the hell is it you object to? Oh yes, being \"in your face\". And what, then, does that mean? Every openly gay person is in someone's face.\n\n You'll find that not many like the in your face attitudes. Some of Matt's postings if done in public would be an example. Aggressive and hostile. \n And openly gay couples aren't always in someone's face.\n The gym teacher at my son's school is gay and has an adopted child. Other than thinking 'well, she's good looking' never saw her as abnormal or a threat to students.\n \n \nI don't need to refute your speculative generalisations about psychology. They don't apply to gays or straights.\n\n Riiigghhtt.\n So, you're fine with the #### spewed from the pulpit and other sources at you. Gays only care about themselves.\n No need to refute it as false. (which you did in another post...I think there's a problem with both of us posting past each other now so points aren't being effectively addressed.)\n \n \nPassive is anything that doesn't call for a change to laws. We need that call, because how else can we point out that laws against gay people are unjust? You keep arguing for activity on the least effective front. That will get us nowhere.\n\n \n =/\n \n I think there's been a misunderstanding here over activism and passive.\n Passive is still for change. It just works on a more low key level.\n \n But, I doubt it's the least effective front.\n Just slower and more methodical than you may like.\n \n My approach would be to take civil unions and then show that they aren't 'equal'. Similar to the seperate but equal laws.\n Your's seemed to push for gay marriage only then whine when you don't get it as if it were some right you should share in. \n The fact is, no one has the right to marry someone of the same sex.\n What you're pushing is that we should have the right to marry whom we wish. \n \n \n TTFN...gotta go to other issues...\n \n (I apologize for any misspellings and disjointed responses...I'm severly over tasked at work *primary's* and really am only interested in the gay issue in a periphery manner.

The KKK sponsored the Rosa Parks freeway near St. Louis which some tried to block but it was protected free speech.\n \n Such programs come with a public sign posted along the stretch of highway.\n \n \n @ Scottd.\n \n I'm a successful 'loop-hole lawyer' type person.\n \n The problem with many here is sometimes some seem to think that everything is plain and straight forward.\n \n \n In a recent post IIRC, it was stated that a billboard sign owner refused to run ads for gay rights.\n A loophope would be to form a gay-oriented religion ala Scientology and (Unitarian style beliefs).\n Such an organization has defined constitutional protections and precidents for support.\n Funds collected could pass as tax deductable 'tithing'. Such funds then could go to 'evangelical' work...aka, posting signs and TV ads.\n And media source that refused to publish such ads is subject to legal action.\n \n As said, political ads are protected and if in a campaign against someone who airs ads in the Media, equal air time laws go into effect.\n \n Adopt a highway, as show, gets a gov't sign posted along the stretch of road adopted in a random location.\n The Minutemen's ended up being near a border crossing in San Orofre.\n The KKK's was along the Rosa Parks highway in St. Louis.\n Like billboards, these are seen, if not overtly then subvertly.\n On my drive from work home, I see several pro-live billboards.\n \n The topic may be teen suicide.\n I see that in US media sources I monitor from time to time.\n The last one I recall of national note was by a girl who's neighbor (an adult woman) pretended to be a boy who liked her...and then treated her like #### over the internet.\n \n Yes, gay kids commit suicide.\n So do many others with differing issues. \n Suicide in teens and young adults in a leading cause of deaths for them, along with car accidents.\n Bully's are such because of their own personal problems more often than not. Psychological research supports this. \n \n As a 'hard core' atheist person who quite often visits churches of many different sects (for shits and giggles and research) I find that the anti-gay agenda isn't as prevalent as pushed by many. There are some very rabid hateful pastors and sects who do this but, they are a minority in the Christian world. Furthermore, some who do engage in this are often self loathing hypocrits as witnessed with Ted Haggard, a Word of Faith pastor at the mega church in CO. \n \n What we had here was a side tangent discussion on methods on dealing with Gay Rights activism.\n Lesz and others want to continue on their path which is their perogative.\n I simply suggested alternative ways that could achieve the results possibly quicker through applied psychomanipulation and subversive infiltration...Oh's No's. \n \n Different tactics to achieve the same goal.\n Different opinions on the validity of the success of the tactics discussed.\n \n So, we'll pretty much go about our own ways. With the gay rights activist here doing what ever it is they are doing.\n And me continuing my work and marveling at the success of other groups in their effective manipulation of the masses. \n I was peripherally in a similar situation roughly 20 years ago when Louisville KY. wanted to enact vendor laws against 'spiritualist and mediums'...basically people who read your palm and such for cash...but considered such to be part of their constitutionally protected religious practices.\n The ACLU was brought in. I don't recall the final outcome of such case...lost interest. *shrug*",

The problem as I see it is how on earth is bullying against gays to be dealt with over and above bullying in other cases too? (while still also dealing with THOSE.) How do you enact a policy that makes bullying against gays worse than bullying the chronically obese kid, or the kid with a learning disability, or the kid with a physical disability, etc.? I remember when I was in junior high decades ago and we had a kid in there that had a quite noticeable physical deformity. That poor kid was constantly harassed, mistreated, bullied, and so forth. I'm sorry, but you can't tell me that what I saw happening was less than what a lot of gay kids have to deal with was not as bad as what some gay kids deal with too (particularly with the rise of gay student groups and so forth these days and the way being gay is becoming so much more accepted).

   "In 1997, Alana Flores found a picture of a naked woman - bound and gagged, with her legs spread and her throat slashed - taped to her locker at school in Morgan Hill, California. On the photo, someone had written, \"Die, die... XXXX b_tch, #### off. We'll kill you.\" Alana, frightened and in tears, took the photo to the assistant principal, who brushed her off and told her to go back to class, saying, \"Don't bring me this trash anymore, this is disgusting.\" The assistant principal then asked Alana if she was gay and said, \"If you're not gay, why are you crying?\"\n \n The next year, Alana and five other students sued their school district for repeatedly ignoring or minimizing many reports by the students that they were being abused by others who thought they were gay. The school district had to pay $1.1 million when Flores v. Morgan Hill Unified School District settled in January of 2004. As a result of the settlement, schools in Morgan Hill now have a comprehensive training program to combat anti-gay harassment. The case also set an important precedent when a federal court ruled that if a school knows anti-gay harassment is happening, it must take meaningful steps to stop it.\n \n It has been over 10 years since the first time a federal court ruled that public high schools have a Constitutional obligation to protect their students from harassment on the basis of sexual orientation. Since then, courts have awarded over four million dollars to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students who filed lawsuits against their schools for refusing to take adequate steps to stop anti-gay harassment. http://www.aclu.org/lgbt/youth/11898res20070209.html\n \n Not sure how it can be any clearer...",

CHILD-LIKE.\n \n You complained earlier about what makes \"your generation\" a problem?\n You are EXEMPLIFYING how you WANT your generation to be a problem.\n \n By giving in to harassment and bullying, and not seeking the proper legal repercussion, and enforcing the existing law, instead relying on anarchy???\n And allowing KIDS to govern things because they may \"resent\" things?\n \n THAT is the REAL problem...\n \n \n \nAnd if you do manage to make them stop physically hurting them you can do nothing about verbal and emotional abuse.\n\n Again, you seem to think that allowing the kids to run things and not correct ILLEGAL activity when present is the \"smart\" thing...\n \n \n \nSimply because of the first amendment.\n\n The first amendment governs adults.\n It governs adults who can stand up, say \"I don't have to listen to this ####\", and they can go home.\n \n When it comes to kids, it's a different story.\n Kids are REQUIRED to be in school, thus it is a CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT that we keep them safe.\n That we provide a LEARNING environment for them, even when they may \"resent\" it...\n \n You seem to want to embrace the rights for an anarchistic approach, while at the same time refuse rights for protection and freedom from assault / bullying.\n Bizarre!\n \n \n \nIts illegal to tell people what they can and cannot say. And even if it was it'd be a hard case to prove.\n\n I recommend you interrupt class to tell that to your teacher.\n I recommend you talk to your friend about how stupid the teacher is (or your friend is) in the middle of class and be reminded of just how wrong you are.\n \n \n \nIf you had your way by the time the kid got out of school he would have been bombarded by people like Phelps and would have killed himself anyway because of the fact that he can't deal with abuse.

And I am sorry that you have suffered such types of abuses at so young an age. I respect your toughness and believe that it is a direct result of your survival instinct kicking in just to get through what has been thrown at you in life.\n \n I would offer this advice, or call it an observation, in the hope that you can appreciate it from whence it comes. And that is to NOT LET the hardness, the coldness and the brutality of this world to pierce your soul and harden your heart toward others. And I think that what has offended foundit so much is that after experiencing what you have personally gone through, you have shown no sympathy or empathy for others who killed themselves after suffering similar abuses as you have.\n \n I would hope that the world not harden you, but that you remain sensitive to both receiving love and feeling the pain of others at least in the area of sympathy and empathy. When we stop feeling others pain, we die a little inside. That is my prayer for you, that you be protected from that hardness.\n \n Have you seen that commercial on TV about the new nail clipper for dogs and cats that sands the nail down rather than clips them? Did you see the close ups of what happens to the animals nail when it's clipped too short and it causes the nail to bleed? They actually show one dog yelping a little from fear and pain of what is happening and every time I see this ad, my blood runs cold and I cringe in emotional stress for the poor dogs. I empathize with animals I don't even know. As wimpy as that sounds, it just shows that I'm able to feel the pain of others, and I hope you can get back to that place again, because I know as a young person, you can remember feeling that way in your own life.

   "Believe me, others of us have come to the same conclusion. You may already know this, but the forum has a built in 'ignore-list' feature which allows you to not have to waste your screen space with peoples' posts who are here to troll or who argue dishonestly and uncivilly. Incidentally, both posters who have jumped on you here are known for some of that.\n\n \n I should have realized thanks for the advice :)\n \n \nI just want to break in here and thank you for being so open about the challenges you have faced as a young person Ryuuichi. And I am sorry that you have suffered such types of abuses at so young an age. I respect your toughness and believe that it is a direct result of your survival instinct kicking in just to get through what has been thrown at you in life.\n \n I would offer this advice, or call it an observation, in the hope that you can appreciate it from whence it comes. And that is to NOT LET the hardness, the coldness and the brutality of this world to pierce your soul and harden your heart toward others. And I think that what has offended foundit so much is that after experiencing what you have personally gone through, you have shown no sympathy or empathy for others who killed themselves after suffering similar abuses as you have.\n \n I would hope that the world not harden you, but that you remain sensitive to both receiving love and feeling the pain of others at least in the area of sympathy and empathy. When we stop feeling others pain, we die a little inside. That is my prayer for you, that you be protected from that hardness.\n \n Have you seen that commercial on TV about the new nail clipper for dogs and cats that sands the nail down rather than clips them? Did you see the close ups of what happens to the animals nail when it's clipped too short and it causes the nail to bleed? They actually show one dog yelping a little from fear and pain of what is happening and every time I see this ad, my blood runs cold and I cringe in emotional stress for the poor dogs. I empathize with animals I don't even know. As wimpy as that sounds, it just shows that I'm able to feel the pain of others, and I hope you can get back to that place again, because I know as a young person, you can remember feeling that way in your own life. And BTW, welcome to the forum. I'm going to invite you to be my friend, OK? emoticon_xgood\n\n \n \n Yeah I'm not as cold hearted as I sound. I just get annoyed when people try to take away the few rights we citizens have left. emoticon_xangel I've just so used to hearing about people off themselves for something or another that at this point I'm more like \"And this is different from the other hundred thousand or so how exactly?\" \n \n I accept your invitation. Though you might find being my friend a bit challenging at times. emoticon_xgood\n \n @foundit66: Wasn't the kid in high school? One would think my examples would be the most appropiate given so. Oh and the whole snitch thing you may be \"too old\" for that kind of thing but honestly yes people don't like being around tattle -tells (as you call them). Hell that goes for most adults too. You don't want to be around the one who is victimized by an innocent comment and you end up being harassed for it. But of course my examples make no sense because I'm only a high school senior and of course I don't understand teen angst despite me just coming out of it emoticon_rolleyes I don't have a clue what that poor boy who offed himself went through nope Not At All. Honestly according to you people can't understand the suffering someone else went through unless they go through the exact same suffering. Suffering isn't suffering with you. Someone losing a father can't relate to someone losing a brother because they're not the same. Someone who was physically abused can't relate to someone who was sexually abused. A male being raped can't empathize with a female being raped and vice versa. Nope because they're not the same .\n \n Edit: Before it even comes up I fully support gay rights. Just not when they infringe on mine :)",

One would think my examples would be the most appropiate given so.\n\n It isn't the \"examples\" I am arguing against.\n It's the pretense that you know best...\n \n Why do you think these rules exist?\n Do you think it's just best for the high school rules to go away, and let the teen-agers run the place?\n \n One of the problems with teens (and I speak from experience) is that they complain that they aren't being treated as adults, when they ARE being treated as adults.\n The type of junk you describe wouldn't fly in the work-place.\n There is no reason it should be allowed to take place in the high school.\n \n \n \nOh and the whole snitch thing you may be \"too old\" for that kind of thing but honestly yes people don't like being around tattle -tells (as you call them). Hell that goes for most adults too.\n\n When the objection from snitches comes from the view-point of the bully, it's based more on the fact that the bully doesn't like getting busted for actions he knows is wrong.\n \n When the objcection comes from the victim, it comes from the view-point of somebody who thinks he is being MORE of a victim for reporting it.\n That is false.\n He/she has already been victimized.\n Seeking justice is not victimization.\n \n \n \nYou don't want to be around the one who is victimized by an innocent comment and you end up being harassed for it.\n\n Quit trying to change the context of my comments.\n I am talking about BULLYING.\n Not \"innocent comments\".\n If you want to change the conversation to \"innocent comments\", I can do so.\n But it should be clear that I was NOT referring to \"innocent comments\", and neither were you...\n \n \n \nBut of course my examples make no sense because I'm only a high school senior and of course I don't understand teen angst despite me just coming out of it emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Again, you're not responding to what I am saying.\n I am not saying that the things you discuss don't exist.\n I am saying they ARE NOT RIGHT.\n \n I think the \"brick wall\" is more that you aren't even listening to what I am saying, and insist on trying to rewrite what I am saying.\n \n \n \nI don't have a clue what that poor boy who offed himself went through nope Not At All.\n\n Which is ironic because you blindly believe he was weak, and that he should receive no sympathy.\n \n \n \nEdit: Before it even comes up I fully support gay rights.

   "Simple when I have to curtail my tongue because his feelings would be hurt. emoticon_rolleyes \n\n We agree then.\n Of course, I see different issues in all that which are totally separate from the angle previously mentioned. Like blatantly lying about somebody is slander or libel.\n For the life of me, I don't understand why a similar approach is ignored when there is an entire group of people being slandered / libeled.\n \n But that is completely different than what was mentioned. I am on a tangent...\n \n \n \nHonestly we're not going to agree...you're going to see him as a victim and I'm going to see him as a example of Survival of the Fittest. He obviously failed and honestly with a 6 billon+ population it isn't a loss.\n\n I could take the same mentality, walk out and shoot a random person on the street, and it's similarly \"not a loss\".\n I mean, with 6 billion+ population, how much does the fact that the guy died by somebody else's hand or his own hand really matter to the person's true self-worth?\n \n \n \nCold? Yes. True? Very much so.\n\n No. Just cold.\n See, I could make my \"survival of the fittest\" thing into a game. I could draw a gun in a crowded theater, shoot once into the air, and then wait 10 seconds. Then shoot the person who was the closest.\n After all, that person wasn't the \"fittest\" as judged by his diminished capacity to recognize and correctly react to a real threat, right?\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n This whole \"survival of the fittest\" thing doesn't lead anywhere real.\n The thing that people like you fail to recognize is that we, as a group, are stronger than the sum of our parts.\n But if we devolve into anarchistic \"survival of the fittest\", it's meaningless.\n \n If I were to hypothetically do that scenario, am I somehow \"fitter\" just cause I managed to put my hands on a gun?\n No.\n \n \n \nIf you kill yourself for whatever reason you obviously didn't want to be here. So most likely you're better off.\n\n \"most likely you're better off\"?\n Talk about absolutely no evidence to substantiate that thought.\n \n Suppose we had a patient who was diagnosed with Disease_X.\n Disease_X is treatable, but the patient doesn't realize that things can be different. Perhaps there are even jerks out there trying to convince the patient that Disease_X makes them less of a human being.\n The patient kills themselves.\n How can that be viewed as a good thing?\n \n \n Another thing you should consider is that there is a historical and proven link between depression and intelligence.\n Depression, a treatable disease, can cause intelligent people to be more likely to commit suicide.\n People who would be more gifted and more capable of helping the society, more likely to kill themselves.\n While others, more jaded and hardened but with less potential to help society, are still around to vote Republican... emoticon_rolleyes\n ( just kidding )\n \n Alan Turing was a great gay man who killed himself because of anti-gay prejudice.\n This great man did some pretty astounding stuff in his time, which was instrumental in helping to win the war against the German Nazis.\n If his country had applied the anti-gay prejudice earlier in his life, he could have killed himself before helping his country. While providing a dark irony to the situation, it would have been more tragic.\n But in your book, he would have been just one in several billion, in a hypothetical situation where Nazism would have been more likely to prevail.\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Maybe someday you'll learn to look at people in terms of potential, and less likely in terms of how much space they take up on this rock...",
