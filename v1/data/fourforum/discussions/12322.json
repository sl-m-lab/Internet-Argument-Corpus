From what I understand, just about any spending is inherently stimulative: the money goes out, gets spent, and starts moving through the economy. We could pay a bunch of workers to dig an enormous hole in the desert and fill it back in, they would go out and buy things, and the economy would be stimulated. Or, we could pay a bunch of workers for incredibly overdue infrastructure repairs, and the economy is stimulated along with roads and bridges that aren't falling apart, power grids that don't fail during seasonal storms, and levees that can stand up to strong hurricanes (all of which also reduce the cost of emergency relief when it may be needed). In this bill, you also have tax relief for small businesses in order to make it easier to hire people, and measures to increase energy efficiency in government buildings (which will also save money in the long term). I'll admit I haven't read the bill itself (I doubt many people have), but most metrics I've seen have said that less than 1% of the spending is what can actually be considered \"pork,\" and a lot of that has been removed in the last week.

Stimulus implies to me a nearly instant boost to the economy.\n \n\n And would you please, for once, spell out exactly how the bill is \"laden with pork\" as you originally stated?\n\n \n Line Items in the Stimulus Package - washingtonpost.com\n The Feb. 1 editorial \"Take Charge\" missed an opportunity to convey just how awful the House-passed \"stimulus\" bill is. Regarding the timeliness of the \"stimulus,\" the editorial noted that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 64 percent of the total outlay would be spent by 2011. It would have been better to point out that the same CBO forecast anticipates that only 21 percent will reach the economy by October. \n With so little impact over the next nine months, this bill is anything but a stimulus. If President Obama is truly a strong leader, he will throw out the left-wing porkfest that is the current bill and draft an actual stimulus bill that is heavy on corporate, income and payroll tax cuts -- all of which would hit the economy and pocketbooks almost immediately upon passage. That is the kind of change we need. \n ************************\n I too have been unable to find a current line item list of provisions in the porkfest. Some things that I would consider pork have already been reduced or removed from the bill.\n \n 246M tax break for Hollywood movie producers\n 75M for salaries for the FBI\n 650M for digital TV converter box coupon program\n 88M Coast Guard Ice Breaker\n 448M Homeland Security Offices\n 248M Homeland Security Furniture\n 600M Hybrid vehicles for federal employees\n 1.4B Rural Waste disposal\n 150M Smithsonian\n 850M for Amtrak\n \n I'm sure the list goes on and on. I'm also relatively sure that once the bill is passed, the average American will not know much more about what was in it than he does right now.\n \n I would bet my last dollar that a great portion of the money spent on goods and services will go to foreign banks.\n \n I don't agree that all spending is stimulus. It is spending that puts money in the pockets of American consumers (to spend again) that really boosts the American economy. While I am aware that we have trade agreements with other countries and cannot afford to start a global trade war, I believe it is possible to concentrate our spending on things that will create jobs here rather than in India or China.\n \n If the American workers will get it through their heads that the labor unions have outlived their usefulness and have hurt our economy more than anything other than high taxes, we can begin again to build a strong economy based on the willingness to work rather than the demand to be overpaid.",

   "Here is a list of what the Republicans consider \"Pork\" in the stimulus bill - at least the version prior to the latest compromise: from What GOP Leaders deem wasteful in Senate stimulus bill - CNN.com\n \nOn Monday, Congressional Republican leaders put out a list of what they call wasteful provisions in the Senate version of the nearly $900 billion stimulus bill that is being debated: \n \n \u0095 $2 billion earmark to re-start FutureGen, a near-zero emissions coal power plant in Illinois that the Department of Energy defunded last year because it said the project was inefficient.\n \n \u0095 A $246 million tax break for Hollywood movie producers to buy motion picture film.\n \n \u0095 $650 million for the digital television converter box coupon program.\n \n \u0095 $88 million for the Coast Guard to design a new polar icebreaker (arctic ship).\n \n \u0095 $448 million for constructing the Department of Homeland Security headquarters.\n \n \u0095 $248 million for furniture at the new Homeland Security headquarters.\n \n \u0095 $600 million to buy hybrid vehicles for federal employees.\n \n \u0095 $400 million for the Centers for Disease Control to screen and prevent STD's.\n \n \u0095 $1.4 billion for rural waste disposal programs.\n \n \u0095 $125 million for the Washington sewer system.\n \n \u0095 $150 million for Smithsonian museum facilities.\n \n \u0095 $1 billion for the 2010 Census, which has a projected cost overrun of $3 billion.\n \n \u0095 $75 million for \"smoking cessation activities.\"\n \n \u0095 $200 million for public computer centers at community colleges.\n \n \u0095 $75 million for salaries of employees at the FBI.\n \n \u0095 $25 million for tribal alcohol and substance abuse reduction.\n \n \u0095 $500 million for flood reduction projects on the Mississippi River.\n \n \u0095 $10 million to inspect canals in urban areas.\n \n \u0095 $6 billion to turn federal buildings into \"green\" buildings.\n \n \u0095 $500 million for state and local fire stations.\n \n \u0095 $650 million for wildland fire management on forest service lands.\n \n \u0095 $1.2 billion for \"youth activities,\" including youth summer job programs.\n \n \u0095 $88 million for renovating the headquarters of the Public Health Service.\n \n \u0095 $412 million for CDC buildings and property.\n \n \u0095 $500 million for building and repairing National Institutes of Health facilities in Bethesda, Maryland.\n \n \u0095 $160 million for \"paid volunteers\" at the Corporation for National and Community Service.\n \n \u0095 $5.5 million for \"energy efficiency initiatives\" at the Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration.\n \n \u0095 $850 million for Amtrak.\n \n \u0095 $100 million for reducing the hazard of lead-based paint.\n \n \u0095 $75 million to construct a \"security training\" facility for State Department Security officers when they can be trained at existing facilities of other agencies.\n \n \u0095 $110 million to the Farm Service Agency to upgrade computer systems.\n \n \u0095 $200 million in funding for the lease of alternative energy vehicles for use on military installations\n\n I am also not an expert in finance and economics but do agree that spending is also a form of stimulus. I would think that the effectiveness of a stimulus package depends on how much \"bang\" you get from your buck - i.e. how much growth you get for each dollar spent, which also depends on how much of the money spent ends up circulating in the American economy, as opposed to being essentially sent abroad through foreign investement or buying foreign manufactured goods. From that point of view, I would see some of the items in this list as pork but others as simply investment in projects that create jobs and simultaneously solve certain problems of infrastructure, etc. Some of the other items on the list would help grow the economy in the long term, but I personally think that short term growth is what this stimulus package should concentrate on.\n \n Meanwhile, what are the Republicans offering as an alternative? All I have heard about so far is tax cuts for, mainly, the wealthy. That doesn't give you much \"bang for your buck\" where stimulus is concerned.",

For example, one from USA Today / Gallup from Feb 4 says that 52% favor the 800 billion dollar package with 38% opposing ( from Budget/Taxes ).\n \n I suspect that, as with myself, most people agree that getting 800 billion more in debt to stave off even worse economic problems is a sacrifice that is worth making as long as that 800 billion is spent wisely. The 800 bilion dollar question is how to spend that money wisely to get the best \"bang for the buck\" in stimulating the economy. This brings up many questions that most people, including myself, do not have a good feel for and, since economists have very differing views, we don't have a unified expert opinion on which to base our judgement. For example, what is more effective as a stimulus - increased investment (which would probably be more effectively produced by tax cuts to the wealthy) or increased spending (which would be more effectively produced by tax cuts to the poor or middle class)? After all, to prosper, companies both need people buying their goods and money to invest in new infrastructure or inventory when it is needed. Another question - what stimulus dollar would keep the money circulating in the US economy the longest? Any stimulus dollar aimed toward tax cuts targeting investment will have a certain significant percentage invested in foreign companies and economies which, though it can have an indirect benefit, is less effective than direct investment in US companies. The same goes for tax cuts aimed at increasing spending - how much of that spending will go toward American made products. All of these subtleties make the question of the most effective investment rather complicated. Overall, it seems that direct government spending on programs will at least be guaranteed that all of the money will be spent in the US - a benefit for US jobs and economy. \n \n As a Republican, what do you personally view as the best form of stimulus? My guess would be that, if you stayed true to the party line, you would favor tax cuts for the wealthy to stimulate more investment.\n \n By the way, the questions in the second paragraph were meant to be rhethorical questions, not questions specifically directed at you, though you are welcome to adress them if you like and add your opinion to the conflicting opinions I have heard from a wide range of economists. I can imagine that part of the trouble in determining the efficacy of various economic stimulus schemes is to disentangle which economic trends are due to the stimulus and which are part of the economic cycle itself, so I would guess that nearly all stimulus methods can have arguements supporting them or opposing them, depending on how one interprets the trends.",

Either way, I agree with you that the support is waning - mainly due to the attacks about pork spending - but it is still significant.\nIf you remember the last two elections than a good pollster is something you should look for. USA and Gallup had polls all over the place while Rasmussen happened to be dead on the last 3 presidential elections. They just seem to have a better method than others...not sure why. In any event, that is merely my opinion and I'd highly recommend looking at their polls from time to time. \n \n \nUnless there is a good reason to think that it will not work, then it seems as viable an option as other options that are usually proposed - such as increasing investment through tax cuts to the wealthy. Do you have any arguement as to why you think that government spending will not stimulate the economy?\nYes as a matter of fact. I've posted this elsewhere but you are one of the best posters on this forum so I'd be happy to give a brief summary.\n \n I think we could agree that our current economic problem is a problem of too much debt...when you really boil it down. My most basic argument is that you can't fix a problem of debt with more debt because this is like paying off one credit card with another. \n \n If you want to look at it another way you can just ask what happens when the government support ends? The idea is that you spend money (run up a huge deficit actually) and this will eventually trigger growth much like jump starting a car. The problem I have with this is you need demand for goods. With a problem of debt you had a situation where people bought too many goods that they couldn't afford and have been living well beyond their means. If the government comes in and offers you a salary of $50,000 to build some stuff what happens? Well mostly you will be paying off the stuff you already bought. From here you have a few choices. You have to sustain this guys $50,000 salary until he can start spending again on items he/she needs which may cause businesses to come up and then the guy can get a job there and stop working for the government. This is hard to do since government workers are really hard to get rid of. Not only that but if demand does increase who's to say it won't be for goods made cheaper overseas. What happens when the $50,000 salary is cut off? If the guy doesn't have a job you just delayed the problem. Finally, you paid this guys salary using debt money for who knows how long. Now you have to pay THAT debt off. You may end up in a hyperinflation state. \n \n Oh, and 800 billion is something like $263 per person. You could say $500 per worker maybe....or if you only give it to 25% of the people it is still not much.\n \n \nI agree that there is no guarantee that it will work to stimulate the economy back toward growth. My main hope would be that it could at least keep our economy from dropping farther into a potential Depression. I would think that doing nothing would be a much greater risk.\nThis seems to be a myth. Doing nothing will cause great harm and pain to this country. I admit this. The thing you have to understand is that this will happen anyway...either now or in the future. You HAVE to pay for what you get. We could buy ourselves some time I suppose but delaying the problem doesn't seem like a true fix to me.\n \n \nCertainly $800 billion is a lot of money but it is relatively small compared to the ~$14.5 trillion GDP of the US (just over 5% of GDP). If the stimulus package would be much smaller, then one would risk having a negligible effect on the economy.\nRemember that the projected actual cost is something like $9.7 trillion which ~75% of GDP. Also, GDP is calculated using government spending as a variable so that number doesn't always mean much. This doesn't exactly translate but the point should be clear.\n \n \nI guess I had always assumed you were a Republican due to your pro-life views on abortion. Sorry to have insulted you. The fact that you actually are insulted in being called Republican surprises me since it suggests that you are opposed to many of their views. I would be curious about the views on which you most differ with Republicans. \nHaha, I'm not really insulted but I'm not a republican although I do have conservative views. The republicans spend money they don't have...I dont support that. Republicans talk about morals but often times don't think it applies to themselves and fail to honor some of the basic ones (one thing I liked about Huckabee was he actually seemed to follow them and believe in them...you can screw up but at least know your purpose). Lets see....the republicans were drunk with power for much of the early 2000s (much like the democrats are now). The republicans are wrong on tax policy. The republicans are wrong on many of their foreign policy ideas. No Child Left Behind left education behind. I mean I can go on if you want....but don't get me wrong, the democrats do about the same stuff, they just use a different name. It is embarrassing to say I voted for Bush but I'd be just as embarrassed to have voted for Gore or Kerry. I didn't vote for Obama or McCain...they were one in the same as far as I could tell and a lot of people are too foolish to see this. \n \n \nAs for spending, I agree that spending on infrastructure is needed and part of the package is designed for spending on infrastrucutre. I do think that spending on new technologies - alternative energy sources - is also useful for the longer term and does create jobs for the shorter term.\nAlternative energy actually might be worthwild if we had the money and made the energy as something we can produce here in the US. Not so much to get off of foreign oil but to have foreign countries rely on our resources for fuel...like corn or something (I dunno, I'm not a scientist).\n \n \nI suppose that I don't have a feel for what your answer would be about tackling this economy. It seems that you are hesitant in introducing any stimulus package because of the debt and because you are skeptical that it would work, but you are not offering any alternative. Do you disagree with the general view that not introducing any stimulus package would let our economy fall farther?\nI agree with it 100%, I'm just saying it probably isn't that bad of an idea. That sounds crazy but the alternative (stimulus) is a good chance of the same result or a better chance of making the problem worse for the future (ie a seemingly better economy with long term consequences and maybe even hyperinflation in 2-3 years). You HAVE to pay for what you take. The bill is due. However you want to say it...the result is still the same.",

Regardless, we're here now...and this is Obama and the left taking advantage of it. Forget about the general principles between the 2 parties, and the realtiy that conservatism asks that we believe in ourselves - while liberalism tells us all we're victims and incapable of doing anything without government aid and direction. (It's true...but forget all that.) This is an easy snapshot of what an educated America will hopefully learn about the liberals and Democrats they are so convinced care so much about them. During these tough times, this is what they're telling us we need to ram through without debate or opposition. And all it amounts to is a long list of items the Democrats have mostly included to either return favors, or to get favors in the future. That's what \"pork\" is.

   "Ending Welfare Reform as We Knew It by The Editors on National Review Online\n \n \n Ending Welfare Reform as We Knew It\n \n By the Editors\n \nPres. Barack Obama vowed to correct the mistakes of the Bush administration but instead is determined to undo one of the great successes of the Clinton years: welfare reform. Democrats have inserted provisions into the catch-all stimulus bill that will reverse Clinton-era welfare reform, re-establishing the wasteful, incentive-killing system whose transformation was the bipartisan pride of the 1990s.\n \n Prior to reform, the federal government simply gave the states more money for every family they added to the welfare rolls. The predictable result was that the states worked hard to maximize their welfare caseloads in order to maximize the amount of federal funding they could therefore claim. The system had zero incentive to help people make the transition from welfare to work and independence-in fact, the states were financially punished for doing so. The Clinton-Gingrich reforms replaced that bounty-hunter system with a flat rate for each state, based on population and other factors. That gave state-level welfare authorities a better set of incentives, encouraging them to use their resources in the most effective manner and to reserve them for the truly needy.\n\n \n \n =snip=\n \n Now let's see. A law that has worked wonders to reduce the poverty rate, get people off the welfare rolls quickly, and instill pride in people once again is shot down by typical Liberal Democrats who want nothing more than to ensure a permanent voting bloc of people dependent on the government for their bread and butter.

And he tells Newsmax TV he especially doesn\u00edt like its provisions allocating billions for so-called \u00eccommunity organizations\u00ee like the controversial Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now.\n \n Vitter lashed out at the proposal to give $4.2 billion to ACORN, which actively recruited voters for President Barack Obama and all Democrats during in the run up to the November election. [Editor's Note: See the full interview - go here now.]\n \n \u00ecThat\u00eds just a political payoff,\u00ee Vitter tells Newsmax\u00eds Ashley Martella. ACORN\u00eds inclusion in the massive $825 billion economic stimulus package comes \u00ecnot in spite of their voter registration fraud activity, really because of it in my opinion in terms of support from some of the liberals in Congress,\u00ee he said.\n \n This is exactly the sort of thing Democrats tried to pass last year in the housing plan that I also opposed,\u00ee Vitter says. In that bill we were at least able to change the language so that money could not go to ACORN and other similar groups. But in this bill they're right back at it and they\u00edre trying to get the money to ACORN again,\u00ee he explains.\n \n ACORN is under investigation in several states for voter registration fraud, Vitter points out.Newsmax.com - Sen.

   "Surprise!... Dem's \"Stimulus Package\" Looks Like Billion $$$ ACORN Bonanza\n ACORN is the largest radical Leftist group in America today.\n This radical group worked closely with the Obama campaign during the election. But, the community organizing group was not open about this. The photo below was scrubbed from the ACORN website before the election:\n \n One of Barack Obama's first big \"community organizer\" jobs involved ACORN in 1992. Obama also trained ACORN employees. He represented ACORN in court. Obama worked with and protested with ACORN. His campaign donated $800,000 to ACORN this year for voter registration efforts.\n And, ACORN even canvassed for Obama this year.\n \n Now it looks like the Far Left group will be generously rewarded for their efforts.\n \n Let Freedom Ring noticed the billions of taxpayer money that will be gifted to ACORN and other leftwing organizations in the stimulus plan.\n House Republican Leader John Boehner reported:\n \n The Democrat's Job Creation\" Bill Offers Taxpayer-Funded Bonanza for Organization Reportedly Under Federal Investigation\n \n Washington, Jan 23 - The House Democrats' trillion dollar spending bill, approved on January 21 by the Appropriations Committee and headed to the House floor next week for a vote, could open billions of taxpayer dollars to left-wing groups like the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). ACORN has been accused of perpetrating voter registration fraud numerous times in the last several elections; is reportedly under federal investigation; and played a key role in the irresponsible schemes that caused a financial meltdown that has cost American taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars since last fall.\n \n House Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH) and other Republicans are asking a simple question: what does this have to do with job creation? Are Congressional Democrats really going to borrow money from our children and grandchildren to give handouts to ACORN in the name of economic \"stimulus?\"\n \n Incredibly, the Democrats' bill makes groups like ACORN eligible for a $4.19 billion pot of money for \"neighborhood stabilization activities.\" Funds for this purpose were authorized in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, signed into law in 2008. However, these funds were limited to state and local governments. Now House Democrats are taking the unprecedented step of making ACORN and other groups eligible for these funds:\n \n \"For a further additional amount for 'Community Development Fund,' $4,190,000,000, to be used for neighborhood stabilization activities related to emergency assistance for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes as authorized under division B, title III of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-289), of which-\n \n \"(1) not less than $3,440,000,000 shall be allocated by a competition for which eligible entities shall be States, units of general local government, and nonprofit entities or consortia of nonprofit entities[.]\"\n \n \"(2) up to $750,000,000 shall be awarded by competition to nonprofit entities or consortia of nonprofit entities to provide community stabilization assistance [...]\"\n The House Democrats' trillion dollar spending bill also includes $1 billion for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program. CDBG funds are given by the federal government to state and local governments which often contract with nonprofits for services related to the purpose of the grant.\n This is what democrats call \"jump-starting\" the economy.\n \n Glenn Reynolds was more accurate when he described it this way, \"This is not so much a stimulus, as a massive transfer of wealth from the politically unconnected to the politically connected.\"\n True.\n \n And just think... Your children get to pay for it!Gateway Pundit: Surprise!... Dem's \"Stimulus Package\" Looks Like Billion $$$ ACORN Bonanza",

But because you think that's a good thing, you will sell your own families financial security for generations in the process. But hey, nothing that happens to this economy will destroy or affect my lifestyle at all because I'm one of those people you leftists want to pay for the mediocrity of others. \n \n My issue is that I don't want to see another welfare state created which contributes to more generations of government dependence which the liberals depend on in order to maintain there hold on political power.

Unless you want everyone but the rich to have a completely free ride. \n The top income earners now shoulder far more of the federal tax burden than they did in the early 1980s.\n \n Any discussion of reforming America&#8217;s federal tax system should begin with the recognition that it is already highly progressive. According to the latest Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data, the top 1 percent of income earners paid nearly 40 percent of federal individual income taxes in 2006,\n \n \n Here we have a recent statistic which reflects the Bush tax policy. As you can see, the top 1% already pays fully 40% of America's tax bill. But you want more? \n \n compared to roughly 19 percent in 1980. Between 1980 and 2006, the share of federal income taxes paid by the top 5 percent jumped from under 37 percent to over 60 percent. During that same period, the share paid by the top 10 percent went from around 49 percent to almost 71 percent.America Has a Highly Progressive Tax System &mdash; The American, A Magazine of Ideas\n \n And here we see that that the top 5% is paying 60% of the tax bill and if we extend it out to the top 10%, we are paying a total of 71% of the US tax bill annually. That means that of the remaining 90% of the national population must split up the remaining 29% of America's taxes. And you think the rich are getting a free ride? \n \n Also, consider that people that make below 16,000 a year pay absolutely NO TAXES at all, so the working poor already do get a free ride as far as paying their fair share goes.
