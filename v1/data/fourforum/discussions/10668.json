   "Below, I have listed a sample of passages taken from the \"inspired\" word of god. [*]Numbers 31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones. [*]Deuteronomy 2:34 utterly destroyed the men and the women and the little ones. [*]Deuteronomy 28:53 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters. [*]I Samuel 15:3 slay both man and woman, infant and suckling. [*]2 Kings 8:12 dash their children, and rip up their women with child. [*]2 Kings 15:16 all the women therein that were with child he ripped up. [*]Isaiah 13:16 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished. [*]Isaiah 13:18 They shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall not spare children. [*]Lamentations 2:20 Shall the women eat their fruit, and children. [*]Ezekiel 9:6 Slay utterly old and young, both maids and little children. [*]Hosea 9:14 give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. [*]Hosea 13:16 their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. \n Is this the same god that created mankind? Is this the same god that gave us commandments to live by?(6th commandment; \"thou shall not kill\" )This god of the bible that murders babies, children, men and women for ridiculous reasons?? \" So, let me gets this straight ;The god of the bible, is the same father-god of the holy trinity? ( god the father, son, holy spirit?) This cruel, god of the Old testament is that same god that sent his son Jesus Christ, in the New Testament, as appropriation for OUR sins? How can one believe in a god that viciously destroys innocent life? His own creation?! Is this REASONABLE? I think not! \n \n Life is a precious gift that was made possible by our Creator's Design. Physical death is the finale of the natural process of life, as we know it. Death may or may not be painless, depending on the circumstances, in which our death occurs. But death should never be caused by senseless slaughter! The real God would never cause death to any living creation, out of hatred, rage, vengeance, \n \n God's Intelligent Design is not capable of man-made errors and venomous judgment. God could not, and would not act,or react to man-made emotions and drama. \n \n The real God, the Ultimate Creator of the Universe, has made it possible for us to ' breath life.' Live it!\n The Universe, with all it's awe, and wonders ... That's God's drama! Enjoy it!",

In the old days, when an engineer ran an engineering firm and understood all the operations, management worked well. Nowadays, you get some accountant, who only understands the numbers generated, cutting as many corners as possible just to squeeze out an extra buck.

Let's start with the first one.\n Jer 6:16 \n Thus says the LORD:\n \n \"Stand in the ways and see,\n And ask for the old paths, where the good way is,\n And walk in it;\n Then you will find rest for your souls.\n But they said, 'We will not walk in it.'\n Jer 6:17 \n Also, I set watchmen over you, saying,\n 'Listen to the sound of the trumpet!'\n But they said, 'We will not listen.'\n Jer 6:18 \n Therefore hear, you nations,\n And know, O congregation, what is among them.\n Jer 6:19 \n Hear, O earth!\n Behold, I will certainly bring calamity on this people--\n The fruit of their thoughts,\n Because they have not heeded My words\n Nor My law, but rejected it.\n Jer 6:20 \n For what purpose to Me\n Comes frankincense from Sheba,\n And sweet cane from a far country?\n Your burnt offerings are not acceptable,\n Nor your sacrifices sweet to Me.\"\n \n Jer 6:21 \n Therefore thus says the LORD:\n \n \"Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people,\n And the fathers and the sons together shall fall on them.\n The neighbor and his friend shall perish.\"\n \n God is speaking to His people, the children of Abraham. Notice 6:16,17. Those are the context passages you people always fail to post. You know, the reason why God is punishing His people. Now for the next one.\n Num 15:28 \n 'So the priest shall make atonement for the person who sins unintentionally, when he sins unintentionally before the LORD, to make atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.\n Num 15:29 \n 'You shall have one law for him who sins unintentionally, for him who is native-born among the children of Israel and for the stranger who dwells among them.\n Num 15:30 \n 'But the person who does anything presumptuously, whether he is native-born or a stranger, that one brings reproach on the LORD, and he shall be cut off from among his people.\n Num 15:31 \n 'Because he has despised the word of the LORD, and has broken His commandment, that person shall be completely cut off; his guilt shall be upon him.'\"\n Num 15:32 \n Now while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.\n Num 15:33 \n And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.\n Num 15:34 \n They put him under guard, because it had not been explained what should be done to him.\n Num 15:35 \n Then the LORD said to Moses, \"The man must surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.\"\n Num 15:36 \n So, as the LORD commanded Moses, all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stone\n \n Do you have a problem with reading a chapter in context before posting this tripe? Look how the chapter is about dealing with unintentional and intentional sin, and even dealing with outsiders who don't know the Law differently than Jews who do know it. This guy was a Jew who understood the Law and blatantly ignored it. Now, being a liberal you may not think the Law should be obeyed, but I suggest you grasp what it will be like standing before a perfectly holy God without the blood protection of the Lamb of God covering you.

I suppose abortion was absolutely fine back then (Numbers 5) but is reprehensible now?\nAll of these are my points, precisely. There is either man's GREAT misunderstanding of god or god is a maniac. I choose to believe there is a great deal of ignorance on the part of man to contribute such atrocities to an entity, any entity.\n \n According to abortion. . . . .a baby was not considered \"human\" until 30 days after it was born. The problem as I see it is control through dogma AND the dogma is so messed up, it makes no sense whatsoever. Religion has been used throughout the ages to dictate to man what is and is not to be tolerated when it is the dogma which cannot be tolerated with any common sense. IMO it takes quite an imagination to honestly believer, without question, the bible, in part or in whole. The bible was written for men of their times in an attempt to explain the unknown and for church rulers to rule the people through superstition. It has worked to the disadvantage of society, countries and the world. \n \n \"Liberal\"? Try replacing the label \"liberal\" with \"reason\", \"rational\" or \"thinking\". Again, we are in a war killing hundreds of thousands of people over religion. People are willing to die for these absolutely stupid beliefs! 72 virgins an all that nonsense. Does anyone have a brain any longer? Did the god of the universe tell Bush to invade Iraq? Think just for a second to see how absolutely deadly and stupid dogma really is!",

After all DrD, If God be God, then doesn't He deserve the respect from us to learn the truth about Him?\n \n If God truly created humanity, don't you want to really know why He did? The absolute truth as to what His long term agenda is regarding such flawed beings as humanity has become? And considering how humanity has screwed up this World with the uncountable Wars and uncountable dead in the wake of those Wars, who are we to judge a holy and perfect Creator who insists that He created us in love and for fellowship?\n \n And if that is true, and you are living a life completely void of a personal relationship with Him, and as you scoff at people like me who insist that such a relationship is not only possible, but very real, then who is really being deceived?

   "... then you reject them anyway as not being just. However, to say what God said is not just is really a contradiction. You really imply in your quote that if God said these then they would not be just and that implies the created knows more than the creator. I think that is a bad move.\n\n \n Although you were replying to smiley, it seems to me that if the 'created' perceive abundant hypocrisy in the 'Creator', then they have a right to comment and call him to account (or dismiss the illogical notion of his existance in any event.) I think that is a GOOD move.",
