It is one of the reasons many christians live a defeated life. They expect God to deliver the goods and when He does not, then they wonder why? What is wrong with me?\n \n The answer is that the only thing wrong with them is their view of God. I do not believe God can be proven to anyone. Even the israelites who lived in the desert for forty years and SAW God lead them as a pillar of fire, watched the parting of the red sea, saw water come from dry rock, received manna from heaven to feed them, saw the glory of God fill the tabernacle and push Moses out, even they continued to disbelieve. It is in the nature of humans to discount miracles.\n \n However, we want to believe. It is evidenced by our fascination with religion and magic. We want the miraculous and we want God to be God.
