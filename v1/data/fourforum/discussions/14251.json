You're XXXXXX that accipiter is saying \"Horus is an analog of Jesus\" without offering evidence, and your rebuttal is \"Horus is not an analog of Jesus\" without offering any evidence.\n\n \n My point is totally clear and totally reasonable, TQ. We all agree that it is unreasonable to accept as true positions that are unevidenced, yes?

We all agree that Accipiter has offered no evidence of this sort, yes?\n \n So we would agree that my position -- that one ought not accept his claims until he bothers to support them -- is a reasonable one, yes?\n \n Now I could certainly tell you lots of things ancients people believed about Horus and support those with evidence.

Surely Accipiter's call for information from the \"other side\" pertaining to \"stuff in my first post\" is asking us to evidence a negative? And really, how else am I supposed to read your first post? Chiding me for claiming -- though I did not -- that \"'Horus is not an analog of Jesus' without offering any evidence?\"\n \n Anyhoo...\n \n Here is a bit from the Stele of Amenmose (Louvre C286), the most complete known description of the Osiris myth before the Hellenistic period (translated in Foster & Hollis 1995). Horus is born to Isis from sexual union with Osiris and is given his father's kingdom:\n \n \n7. His sister [Isis, sister of Osiris] served as his protector, drove off the enemies, put a stop to the misdeeds; Removed the Enemy by power of her spell-golden-tongued, her speech cannot fail, Skilled in command, beneficent Isis, who rescued her brother. She searched for him, would not give in to her weariness, wandered about this land in mourning, Would not take rest until she had found him. She made him shade with her feathers, made breeze by fanning her wings; Danced the Dance of Last Mooring for her brother, tempered the weakness of Him who was weary of heart; She received his seed, produced an heir, brought up the child in solitude (the place could not be known); Introduced him, with his arm grown sturdy, into the court of Geb.\n \n 8. And the Ennead rejoiced, \"Welcome, Horus, son of Osiris, Firm-hearted and true of voice, son of Isis and heir of Osiris!\" The Tribunal of Truth assembled for him, the Nine Great Gods and the Lord of All; The Lords of Truth were gathered there, those who turn their backs upon evil. They sat themselves down at the court of Geb to offer the legacy to its rightful owner and the kingship to whom it belonged. And they determined for Horus, his voice was true; and his father's legacy was given to him.\n\n \n The recto of P. Chester Beatty I, dating to the reign of Ramses V, gives a very detailed account of Horus' battles with Seth:\n \n Horus is given the kingdom of Osiris, but Seth is upset and wants it for himself (1). Some gods side with Seth, others with Horus, and it is decided by Banebdjede that they'll write to the goddess Neith who'll decided between them (2). Neith says Horus will get the office, and Seth will get the goddesses Anat and Astarte. This doesn't go over well with Re, and together with the Ennead, the nine great gods, he questions Horus and Seth individually. Seth lays out the reasons why he thinks he should get the kingdom -- some gods again agree, thinking Horus too young, and others dissent, thinking that as Osiris' son, it should naturally fall to him. Horus says that his birthright should not stolen from him, and Isis speaks in his defense. (3-5). All the gods go over the Island in the Midst, and Isis changes herself into a beautiful young woman who Seth lusts after. In this form she tells him a story about being the wife of a herdsman who died and whose son was tending the cattle in his place. Another man, she said, came and told the boy that he would take the cattle and drive him out. To this Seth dsif that it was only proper that the son should receive the cattle. Isis transformed again, and Seth realized that he had just confessed the immorality of his own position (5-8). Atum gives the crown to Horus, but Seth won't give up. He challenges Horus; they will turn into hippos, submerge themselves, and whoever comes up out of the water before three months are through will not get the crown. Isis is worried for her son and tries to kill Seth with a harpoon, but releases it from him when he cries out. When she relents, Horus is himself upset and cuts off Isis' head. The Ennead set off to punish him, but Seth finds him first, cuts out his eyes, and buries them. Hator finds him blind and weeping and heals his sight with milk (8-11). The Ennead tell them to stop the constant fighting, settle down and feast together. Seth then invites Horus to a meal, gets sexually aroused, and humps Horus between his thighs. Horus takes Seth's semen and shows Isis, who cuts off his hand, throws the hand into a river, makes him a new one, puts ointment on his penis, fluffs him up and collects his semen in a pot. She then goes off to Seth's garden, pours Horus' semen on Seth's food who then eats it and becomes pregnant with Horus' child. The Ennead call them again, and Seth reports that the kingdom should be his because he has used Horus sexually. They call the semen of both men to witness, and it is learned that Seth's semen is in the river while Horus' is in Seth (11-13). Seth then challenges him to a boat race, which Horus again wins. They finally exchange letters with Osiris, who is naturally upset for his son's plight, and Seth is bound by the orders of Atum. In chains, Seth can only agree that Horus is the true heir, and Osiris' son is subsequently crowned. Isis and the Ennead rejoice (13.16).",
