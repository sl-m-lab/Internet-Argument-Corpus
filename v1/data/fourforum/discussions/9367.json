   "Here is something to talk about.\n \n http://www.pridesource.com/article.shtml?article=21773\n \n LOve this quote\n \n \nAnti-Gay extremism. In places like Michigan we are already suffering from a brain drain, losing talented and open-minded young people to cities like Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, New York and D.C. So why not push our future leaders and taxpayers out of the nest faster by telling all gay families to get the hell outta Dodge? Nothing recruits business and new development like a big billboard at the Windsor Tunnel and Toledo border saying, \"Welcome to Michissippi -you could be banned next.\" Sending a message that LGBT people aren't welcome hurts our local economy and tourism and invites people to move to other states or even Canada. Then again, maybe that is what the religious right wants - a whole new Salem or Plymouth Rock, nestled somewhere between Holland and Howell.\n",
