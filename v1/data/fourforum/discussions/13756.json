Ants have reproductive castes, the queens and males, and nonreproductive castes, the workers....\n \n Male ants are generally winged and usually keep their wings until death.

   "Unfortunately, Gansao likes ammonia-tainted ground beef, no accounting for tastes there:\n \nDecember 31, 2009\n Safety of Beef Processing Method Is Questioned\n Eight years ago, federal officials were struggling to remove potentially deadly E. coli from hamburgers when an entrepreneurial company from South Dakota came up with a novel idea: injecting beef with ammonia.\n \n The company, Beef Products Inc., had been looking to expand into the hamburger business with a product made from beef that included fatty trimmings the industry once relegated to pet food and cooking oil. The trimmings were particularly susceptible to contamination, but a study commissioned by the company showed that the ammonia process would kill E. coli as well as salmonella.\n \n ... With the U.S.D.A.'s stamp of approval, the company's processed beef has become a mainstay in America's hamburgers. McDonald's, Burger King and other fast-food giants use it as a component in ground beef, as do grocery chains. The federal school lunch program used an estimated 5.5 million pounds of the processed beef last year alone.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/us/31meat.html\n \n Unfortunately, my taste buds work and I know what real beef tastes like so excuse me while I barf at the idea of ammonia-tainted beef.\n \n Another problem is that injecting ammonia into beef doesn't do the job:\n \nBut government and industry records obtained by The New York Times show that in testing for the school lunch program, E. coli and salmonella pathogens have been found dozens of times in Beef Products meat, challenging claims by the company and the U.S.D.A. about the effectiveness of the treatment. Since 2005, E. coli has been found 3 times and salmonella 48 times, including back-to-back incidents in August in which two 27,000-pound batches were found to be contaminated. The meat was caught before reaching lunch-rooms trays.\n \n In July, school lunch officials temporarily banned their hamburger makers from using meat from a Beef Products facility in Kansas because of salmonella - the third suspension in three years, records show. Yet the facility remained approved by the U.S.D.A. for other customers.\n \n .... In response, the agriculture department said it was revoking Beef Products' exemption from routine testing and conducting a review of the company's operations and research. The department said it was also reversing its policy for handling Beef Products during pathogen outbreaks. Since it was seen as pathogen-free, the processed beef was excluded from recalls, even when it was an ingredient in hamburgers found to be contaminated.\n\n Of course, this was during the George Bush/Dick Cheney administration so, assuredly, they didn't give a damn about food safety for Americans.",
