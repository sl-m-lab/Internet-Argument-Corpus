   "It is said that the bible is the most sold book in history. I'll add that it is the least read of all books as well.\n \n This is a section of beliefs about God. . .the God of the bible. . . the God Christians truly believe in. I do not wish to get everyone angry so if you are sensitive about this subject, do not read further. \n \n The bible describes God in many ways. . . How many of these do you believe represents God?\n \n We can't tell a kid where God came from but with the bible we can tell him what God is like. \n \n One is a description of God with horns. . .horns on his hands and coals coming from his feet; \n God's conduct . . . .According to Amos [*]He stands on a wall with a plum line; [*]Job tells us He runs like a giant and roars like a lion; [*]Joshua says He curses; [*]Genesis says He hisses; [*]Isaiah says He spews; [*]Revelations says He changes his mind; [*]Exodus says He sends scabs; [*]He's a tailor and a clothier; [*]He shows his back parts, [*]He chats with the devil;[*]He delivers a man into the devil's power; [*]He charges his angels with folly; [*]He takes no pleasure in men's legs; [*]He causes adultery, [*]He causes suicide, [*]He causes indecency; [*]He instructs Samuel to lie. [*]He created evil and He loves to oppress people. [*]He's troubled in his bowels, He makes a noise; [*]His breath causes frost, His breath also kindles coals; [*]He asks questions, [*]He's a baker; [*]He works with his fingers, [*]He considers some men to be smoke in his nose. [*]He rewards transgressors, [*]He rewards fools; [*]He orders men to drink, to get drunken and to spew; [*]He takes away nose jewels, [*]He visits earth and inspects buildings; [*]He's weary with repenting, [*]He spreads dung on men's faces; [*]He has a keen sense for roast beef, [*]He deceives his own prophets; [*]He sanctions slavery, [*]He orders slave capturing expeditions; [*]He orders the slaughter of men women and children, [*]He sanctions the violation of virgins; [*]He sends men a dilution to trap men into damnation, \n at least according to the bible.God appears to be a lot of things to different writers of the gospel. \n Can all be right? Can all be wrong? \n Can we really know who, what or where God is? The truth is we don't. We know what people believed thousands of years ago. . .that's all.\n \n These are some of the obvious problems with worshiping the God of the bible. I would like to hear your reactions. . . . . . . If you want sources, google them.. . they're there.\n \n This is NOT the God I worship.",
