   "Where Satan's Seat Is?\n \n PERGAMOS: Satan's Throne and Dwelling Place. To many, these phrases have been merely pictorial rather than truly historical. But they are surely real and history bears that out. Pergamos was indeed the throne and dwelling place of Satan . It happened on this wise:\n \n \n Pergamos was not originally the place where Satan (as concerning human affairs) dwelt. Babylon has always been literally and figuratively his headquarters. It was in the city of Babylon that Satanic worship had its origin. Gen. . 10:8-10 , \"And Cush begat Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty Hunter before the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.\" Gen. . 11: 1-9 , \" And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there. And the said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And the had brick for stone, and slime they had for mortar. And they said, Go to,let us us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And the Lord cam e down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down , and there confound their language, that they many not understand one another's speech. So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth. and they left off to build the city. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.\"\n \n \n Babel is the original name for Babylon. It means confusion. It was literally started by Cush, the son of Ham, but was brought to a kingdom of power and grandeur under his son, Nimrod, the mighty Hunter. Nimrod, according to the Genesis eleven account and also according to profane history, set out ot accomplish three things. He wanted to build a strong nation, which he did. He wanted to propagate his own religion, which he did. He wanted to make a name for himself, which he also accomplished. His accomplishments were so monumental that the kingdom of Babylon was called the head of gold amongst all world governments. That his religion gained prominence is proven by the fact that Scripture identified it with Satan completely in Isa. Ch. 14 and in Rev. Chs. 17-18 . And by history we can prove that it invaded the whole world and is the basis for every system of idolatry, and the them of mythology, though the names of the gods differ in various sections of the land according to the language of the people. That he made a name for himself and his followers goes without saying, for as long as this present age goes on ( until Jesus reveals Himself to His brethren) he will be worshipped and honored, though under a different name from Nimrod, and in a a temple slightly different from the one in which he was originally adored.\n \n Since the Bible does not deal in the histories of other nations in detail, it will be necessary to search the ancient profane records to find our answer as to how Pergamos became the seat of the Satanic religion of Babylon. The major sources of information will be in records of Egyptian and Grecian culture. The reason for this is that Egypt received her science and mathematics from the Caldeans and in turn Greece received them from Egypt. Now since the priests were in charge of teaching these sciences, and since these sciences were used as a part of religion , we already know the key as to how the Babylonish religion gained its strength in these two countries. It is also true that whenever a nation was able to overcome another nation, in due time the religion of the subduer became the religion of the subdued. It is well known that the Greeks had the very same signs of the Zodiac as did the Babylonians; and it has been found in the ancient Egyptian records that the Egyptians gave the Greeks their knowledge of polytheism. Thus the mysteries of Babylon spread from nation to nation until it appeared in Rome, in China, India and even in both North and South America we find the very same basic worship.\n \n The ancient histories agree with the Bible that this Babylonish religion was certainly not the original religion of earth's early peoples. It was the first to drift away from the original faith; but it was not itself the original one. Historians such as Wilkinson and Mallett have proven conclusively from the ancient documents that at one time all the peoples of the earth believed in ONE GOD, supreme,eternal, invisible, Who by the Word of His mouth spoke all things into existence, and that in his character he was loving and good and just. But as Satan will always corrupt whatever he can, we find him corrupting the minds and hearts of men so that they reject the truth. As he has always attempted to receive worship as though he were God and not the \"servant and creation\" of God, he drew worship away from God to the end that he might draw it unto himself and so be exalted. He certainly did accomplish his desire to spread his religion throughout the whole world. This is authenticated by God in the Book of Romans. \" When they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, until they became vain in their imaginations, and through darkness of heart accepted a corrupted religion to the extent that they worshipped creatures and not the Creator\". Remember, Satan was a creature of God(Son of the Morning). Thus we find that where once truth was disseminated amongst men, and all held to that one truth, there later came a day when a vast group turned from God and spread a diabolical form of worship around the world. History bears out that those of the tribe of Shem that stood with the unchanging truth were in solid opposition to those of Ham who turned away from truth to the devil's lie. There is no time to engage in a discussion of this; it is merely introduced that you may see there were two religions and two only, and the evil one became world wide.\n \n Monotheism turned to polytheism in Babylon. The devil's lie and the devil's mysteries rose up against the truth of God and the mysteries of God in that city. Satan truly became the god of this world and exacted worship from those that he had duped, causing them to believe that he was truly the Lord.\n \n The polytheistic religion of the enemy began with the trinitarian doctrine. it was way back there in antiquity that the \"one God in three persons\" idea came into existence. How strange that our modern theologians have not spotted this; but evidently just as duped by Satan as their forebears were, they still believe in three persons in the God head. Let us be shown just one place in Scripture where there is authority for the doctrine. Is It not strange that while the descendants of Ham went o n their way in Satanic worship which involved a basic concept ot three gods that there is not on e trace of the descendants of Shem believing such a thing or having any ceremonial worship that involved even a type of it? It is not strange that the Hebrews believed, 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is ONE God\", if there were three persons in the Godhead? Abraham, the descendant of Shem, in Gen. 18 saw only ONE God with two angels.\n \n Now how was this trinity expressed ? It was expressed by an equilateral triangle even as if ti expressed in Rome today. Strange, the Hebrews did not have such a concept. Now who is right? Is it the Hebrews or the Babylonians? In Asia the polytheistic idea of three gods in one came out in an image with three gods in one came out in an image with three heads on one body. He is expressed as three intelligence's. In India, they found it in their hearts to express him as one god in three forms. Now that really is good modern day theology. In Japan there is a great Buddha with three heads like the one we previously described. But the most revealing of all is that which sets forth the trinitarian concept of God in a triune form of : 1. The head of an old man symbolizing God the Father, 2. A circle which in the mysteries signified\" Seed\" which in turn means the Son. 3. The wings and tail of a bird( dove). Here was the doctrine of Father, Son, and Holy ghost , three persons in the Godhead, a veritable trinity. You can see the same thing in Rome. Now let me ask once again, is it not strange that the devil and his worshippers actually had more truth revealed than the father of faith( Abraham) and his descendants? Is it not strange that the worshippers of Satan, knew more about God than the children of God? Now that is what modern theologians try to tell us when they talk about a trinity. Just remember this one thing from now on: these records are facts and this is a fact-\n \n \n -Satan is a liar and the father of lies, and whenever he comes with any light it is still a lie . He is a murderer. And his doctrine of the trinity has destroyed the multitudes and will destroy until Jesus comes.\n \n According to history it did not take long for a change to be made in this concept of a Father and a Son and the Holy Ghost. Satan took them a step at a time away from the truth. The evolved concept of Deity was now: 1. The eternal Father, 2. The Spirit of God incarnate in a HUMAN mother.( Does that make you think) 3. A Divine Son, the fruit of that incarnation, ( Woman's seed)\n \n \n But the devil is not content. He hasn't achieved worship of himself yet, except in an indirect way. So he takes the people away from the truth still further. Through his mysteries he reveals to the people e that since the great invisible father God does not concern himself in the affairs of men, but remains silent relative to them, then if follows that he may well be worshipped in silence. Actually it means to ignore him as much as possible, if not altogether. This doctrine spread around the world also, and right today in India you can see that temples to the great creator, the silent god, are strikingly few in number\n \n Since it was not necessary to worship the creator-father, it was only natural that worship swung to the ' Mother and Child\" as the objects of adoration. In Egypt there was the same combination of mother and son called Isis and Osiris . In India it was Isi and Iswara. ( Note the similarity of names even) In Asia it was Cybele and Deoius. In Rome and in Greece it followed suit . \n And in China with rays of light emanating from the head of the babe. The image could well have been exchanged for the one in the Vatican except for the difference of certain facial features.\n \n It now behooves us to discover the original mother and child . The original goddess- mother of Babylon was Semiramis who was called Rhea in the eastern countries. \n In her arms she held a a son, who though a babe, was described as tall, strong, handsome and especially captivation to the women, In Ezek. 8: 14 he was called Tammuz. Amongst classical writers he was called Bacchus. To the Babylonians he was Ninus. What accounts for the fact that he is represented as a babe in arms and yet described as a great and mighty man is that he is known as the \"Husband-Son\". One of his titles was \"Husband of the Mother\", and in India where the two are known as Iswara and Isi, he( the husband) is represented as the babe at the breast of his own wife.\n \n \n That this Ninus is the Nimrod of the Bible we can affirm by comparing his story with the Genesis account . Pompeius said, 'Ninus, king of Assyria, changed the ancient moderate ways of life by the desire for conquest. He was the first who carried war against his neighbors. He conquered all nations from Assyria to Lybia as these men knew not the arts of war.\" Diodorus says, \" Ninus was the most ancient of Assyrian kings mentioned in history. Being of warlike disposition he trained many young men rigorously in the arts of war. He brought Babylon under him while yet there was no city of Babylon.\" Thus we see this Ninus started to become great in Babylon, built Babel and took over Assyria, becoming its king, and then proceeded to devour other vast territories where the people were unskilled in war and lived in a moderate way as said Pompeius. Now in Gen.10, speaking of the kingdom of Nimrod it says, , \"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh in the land of Shinar. Out of that land went forth Asshur and builded Ninevah, and calah etc.\" But the translators made a mistake in translating Asshur as a noun for it is a verb, and in the Chaldee means\" to make strong. \"Thus it is Nimrod, who having been made strong( he established his kingdom by building the world's first army which he trained by drilling and through the rigors of hunting) went beyond Shinar with his strong army and subdued nations and built such cities as Ninevah, which was named after him, for even today a chief part of that city is called Nimroud!\n \n \n \n Since we have discovered who Nimrodwas, it is now necessary to discover who his father was. According to history it was Bel, the founder of Babylon( Now it is to be noted here that Bel founded it in the sense that he started this whole move, but it was the son, Ninus, that established it and was the first king ect) But according to the Scripture, the father of Nimrod was Cush: And Cush begat Nimrod.\" Not only is this so but we find that Ham begat Cush. Now, in the Egyptian culture Bel was called Hermes, and Hermes means, \" the son of ham.\" \n According to history Hermes was the great prophet of idolatry. He was the interpretor of the gods. Another name by which he was called was Mercury.( Read Acts 14:11-12)\n \n Hyginus says this about that god who was known variously as Bel, Hermes, Mercury etc, \" For many ages men lived under the government of Jove( not the Roman Jove, but Jehovah of the Hebrews who predates Roman History) without cities and without laws, and all speaking one language. But after that Mercury ( Bel, Cush) interpretedthe speeches of men ( whence an interpreter is called Hermeneutes) the same individual distributed the nations. Then discord began.\" It is seen from this that Bel or Cush, the father of Nimrod, originally was the ring leader that led the people away from the true God and encouraged the people as the \" interpreter of the gods\" to take another form of religion. He encouraged them to go ahead with the tower which his son actually built. This encouragement is what brought the confusion and the division of men, so that he was both, \" interpreter and confuser.\"\n \n \n Cush, then, was the father of the polytheistic system and when men were deified by men , he of course, became the father of the gods. Now Cush was called Bel. And Bel in Roman mythology was Janus. He is pictured as having two faces and he carried a club by which he confounded and \" scattered\" the people. Ovid writs that Janus said concerning himself, \" the ancients called me Chaos\". Thus we find that the Cush of the Bible,\n the original rebel against monotheism was called Bel, Belus, Hermes, Janus, etc. amongst the ancient peoples. He purported to bring revelations and interpretations from the gods to the people. In doing so he caused the wrath of God to scatter the people , bringing division and confusion.\n \n \n Now up to this point we have seen whence polytheism or the worship of many gods came. But did you notice that we also found a mention of a man named Cush who was given a a title of \" the father of the gods\"? Did you notice here the old theme of ancient mythologies, that gods identify themselves with men? That is where ancestor worship comes from. So we might just examine history to find out about ancestor worship. Well, it was brought out that Cush introduced a three god worship of father, son and spirit. Three gods who were all equal. But he knew about the seed of the woman coming , so there would have to be a woman and her seed come into the picture. This was brought to pass when Nimrod died. His wife, Semiramis deified him, and thus made herself the mother of the son also the mother of the gods.( just exactly as the Roman church has deified Mary. They claimed she was without sin and was the Mother of God) She( Semiramis) called Nimrod \" Zeroashta\" which means, \" the woman's promised seed.\"\n \n But it wasn't too long until the woman began to attract more attention that the son, and soon she was the one who was depicted as trampling underfoot the serpent. They called her \" the queen of the heaven\" and made her divine. How like today wherein Mary, the mother of Jesus, had been elevated to immortality and right now as of September 1964 the Vatican council is attempting to give a quality to Mary she does not possess, for they would like to call her, \" Mary the Mediatrix,\" \" Mary the Mother of All Believers,\" or \" Mother of the Church.\" If there was ever Babylonish ancestor worship in a religion, it is th religion of the Church of Rome\n \n \n Not only was ancestor worship originated in Babylon bus so also was the worship of nature. It was in Babylon the gods were identified with the sun and moon, etc The chief object in nature ws the sun which has light giving and heat giving properties and appears to man as a a ball of fire in the heavens. Thus the chief god would be the sun god whom the called Baal.\n Often the sun was depicted as a circle of flame and soon around that flame there appeared a serpent. It wasn't long until the serpent became a symbol for the sun and consequently worshipped. Thus the desire of Satan's heart became full-fledged. He was worshipped as God. His throne was established. His slaves bowed to him. There in Pergamos in the form of a living serpent he was worshipped. T he tree for the Knowledge of Good and Evil , now symbolizes in the form of a living serpent had not only seduced Eve but the majority of mankind.\n \n But how did Pergamos become the seat of Satan if Babylon was the seat? The answer again is in history. When Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians, the priest-king, Attalus fled the city an went to pergamos with his priest and sacred mysteries. There he set up his kingdom outside the Roman empire, and thrived under the care of the devil\n \n \n This has been a very short resume ot the history of the Babylonish religion and its advent to Pergamos. Many questions are no doubt left unanswered and much more, no doubt, could have been said to enlighten us, but this is not intended to be a study of history, rather it is intended to be a help to a study of the word.",

   "The Denunciation\n \n Rev. 2:14-15 , \"But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication . So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.\n \n \n In this Pergamean Age the Lord denounces two doctrines which He hates: 1. The doctrine of Balaam which brought idolatry and sinful excess to Israel at Baal-Peor, and 2. The doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which had been but deeds in the Ephesian Age. Combine this denouncement with the fact THAT hE HAS BEEN EMPHASIZING Pergamos AS THE SEAT of Satan, and it is very easy and proper to conclude that somehow the religion of Babylon has become intermingles with Christianity.\n \n Now this is not merely an assumption but an historical fact which we will prove by going back in to history to about 36 A.D. and coming up to the Nicene Council of 325. When the Christians (mainly Jews by birth) were scattered abroad from Jerusalem they went everywhere preaching the Gospel, particularly in the synagogues. Thus within three years, or about in 36 A.D. the Gospel had been taken to Rome by Junius and Andronicus, who according to Romans 16:7 were apostles. The work flourished there for several years until the constant altercations of the Jews amongst themselves caused Emperor Claudius to expel them from Rome. With the Jews banished from that city the backbone of that little church was practically broken . Perhaps even the elders had been Jewish and so would be gone. The flock would be unattended and since the Word had not been written as a guide it would be very easy for this little flock to drift or be inundated by the philosophers and pagans of that day. With grievous wolves on the prowl, and the spirit of antichrist released, we find from history that this little church in Rome became hopelessly backslidden , and began to introduce pagan ceremonies under Christian titles.\n \n As the period of Banishment lasted for 13 years, the founders, Junius and Andronicus, did not come back until 54 A.D.. Imagine their horror to find a church with a Christian title that was woefully pagan. There were altars in the church upon which they placed incense and celebrated pagan rites. The established leaders of that church could not be approached, so with the few who hs tried to remain faithful they started a new church , or the Second Church of Rome. God graciously worked amongst them by signs and wonders so that a third church was started. And though the First Church was reproached for being pagan and Not Christian in its worship it would not give up its title but remained and STILL REMAINS the First Church of Rome - The Roman Catholic Church.\n \n Now the majority of us have the mistaken idea that any and all who call themselves Christians would be the target of the devil ns consequently the brunt the governmental tyranny. But not so. This First church had begun to thrive and multiply so in numbers that the emperors and various officials of the government actually favored that church for political reasons. Thus when the leaders of the First Church in Rome found themselves in favor, they took the opportunity to turn the government against the true believers and demand their persecution unless they cam e in to their fold. One such bishop of the First Church of Rome was Anicetus who lived in the second century and was contemporary with Poly carp. When the venerable Poly carp heard that the First Christian Church of Rome was involved in pagan ceremonies and had corrupted the truth of the Gospel , he went there to implore them to change. He saw them prostrate themselves before images named after apostles and saints. He saw them light candles and burn. He saw them celebrate the Passover under the name of Easter, where they elevated the disc shaped bread that honored the sun god, and then they poured the wine out as a libation to the gods. But this aged saint who had traveled 1500 miles could not arrest their downwards plunge. God spoke through him just as he was leaving, \"\n Ephraim is married to his idols, let him alone,\" Ho. 4:15. Poly carp never returned.\n \n \n \n Following Anicetus was the wicked bishop of Rome called Victor. He introduced even more pagan festivals and ceremonies into the First Church, and also went about trying his utmost to persuade the true Christian churches ot incorporate the same ideals. They would not do as he requested so he prevailed upon government officials to persecute the believers, hailing them into court, casting them into prison and even meting out death to many. Such an example of his vile deed is found in history where Emperor Septum's was prevailed upon by Callosities( the friend of VIctor) to kill 7000 Thessolonica because these true believers celebrated the Passover according to the Lord Jesus and not according to the worship of Astarte\n \n Already the false vine was turning loose its anger against the living God by killing the elect, even as did its forebear, Cain, kill Abel.\n \n The true church kept trying ot get the First Church to repent. It would not do so. It increased in size and influence. It embarked upon a constant campaign to discredit the true seed. They claimed that they and they alone were the true representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the vaunted the fact that they were the original church in Rome , and they alone were the First Church. Indeed they were The First Church, and INDEED THEY ARE.\n \n Thus by the time of this third church age we have two churches bearing the same name but with a bitter difference between them. One has departed form the truth, married idols and has no life in her. She has hybridized herself and the sighs death( not life), follow in her wake . The other is a little persecuted group. But she follows the Word, and the signs follow her. The sick are healed and the dead are raised. She is alive with the Life and the Word of God. She loves not her life, but holds to His Name and His Faith even unto death.\n \n \n And so this terrible persecution of official Rome fell upon the true believers until Constantine arose and granted freedom of religious worship. There seems to be two reasons why this freedom was granted. In the first place various good emperors had not allowed persecution , but as they passed on, they were followed by those who killed Christians. It was so senseless that if finally cam to to public heed that the Christians ought to be left alone. The second and best noted reason is that Constantine has a very difficult battle ahead of him in taking over the control of the empire. One night in a dream he saw white cross appear before him . He felt that this was an omen unto him that if the Christians prayed for a victory for him he would win the battle. He promised freedom for them in the event that he was victorious. \n \n He was victorious and the freedom of worship was granted in the edict of Nannies 312 A.D.\n \n \n n breaketh in But this freedom from persecution and death was not as magnanimous as it first appeared. Constantine was now the patron. As a patron his interest was somewhat more than that of an observer, for he decided that the church needed his help in her affairs. He had seen them disagreeing g over various matters, one of which involved Arias, Bishop of Alexander, who taught his adherents that Jesus wa not truly God but a lesser being, having been created by God . The Western Church held the opposite view, believing that Jesus was the very essence of God and as they said ' coequal with the Father.' With such matters, along with the intrusion o pagan ceremony in ot worship, the emperor called for Nicene Council in 325 with the thought that he would bring all groups together where they could iron out their differences, and come to a common understanding , and all be one. Isn't it peculiar that though this started with Constantine it didn't die but is very much alive today as the \"World Council of Churches\"? And where he failed to truly achieve it , it will be achieved in this day through the ecumenical move\n \n \n Now this interference of the state with the church is a foolish thing for the world does not understand either the truth found in the Word or the ways of the church. WHY, the very decision handed down by the council that Arias was wrong and was reversed two years later by the emperor and for many years that false doctrine was foisted upon the people\n \n \n \n \n But that the church and state would come together was truly fore known of the Lord. The very name Pergamos means \"thoroughly married.\" And indeed state and church were married; politics and religion were united. The offspring of that union have been consistently the most horrible hybrids the world has ever seen. The truth is not in them., but all the evil ways of Cain( the first hybrid is)\n \n \n Not only was state and church wedded in this age, but the Babylonian religion was officially joined to the First Church . Satan now had access to the Name Of Christ and he was enthroned as God in worship . With the help of federal aid the churches fell heir to beautiful buildings which were lined with altars of white marble and images of the departed saints. And right in this age is when the \"beast of Rev. 13:3 that was wounded to death:( the pagan roman empire) came back to life and power as the \" Holy Roman Empire.\" Rome as a material nation had suffered much depletion and soon would suffer it completely; but it mattered no not, for her religious empire would keep her on top of the world governing from the inside where she would not appear to do so from the outside.\n \n Let me show the exact Scriptural truth of this matter, for I do not want anyone to think that I am giving a revelation of my own- one not found in Scripture. Dan 2:31-45, \" The, O king, safest, and behold a great image. This great image whose brightness was excellent t, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible . This image's head was of fine gold , his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. The safest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay , the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation therof before the king. The O King, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kindgom , power , and strength, and glory. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beast of the fields and the fowls of the heaven hath He given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. The art this head of gold. And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron\" for forasmuch as iron pieces and subdueth all things\" and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise wheras thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided, but there shall be in it the strength of iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, an part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken, And where as thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall breaks in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and is shall stand for ever. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.\" Herein is revealed an exact account of future, unfilled history that was prophesied to come upon the earth from the time of Daniel until Jeu would come and reign as the Son of David. It is known as \"The Times of the Gentiles.\"\n \n It had within if four historical divisions which were known by the dominating empire in each division: Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Grecian, Rome. The greatest and most absolute monarchy was the Babylonian which was typified as the head of gold. The e next in glory was the Medo-Persian which as history bore out was truly less glorious and was typified as the breast and arms of silver . Then there followed the Grecian age whose king was the most brilliant to of all military leaders the world has ever known so it was fittingly typified as the belly and thighs of brass. It was less glorious than the other two preceding it. Finally came the last kingdom which ws the Roman Empire typified as the legs and feet. But wherein the former kingdoms were typified as pure minerals(pure gold, silver, and brass) this last empire was pure iron only in the legs, for when it came to the feet it was a mixture of iron and clay, and mineral and soil just don't mix and produce constancy and strength. But not only is this so , but most amazing , this last empire( ROMAN) would endure in its peculiar ' mixed state' right up until Jesus returns.\n \n \n This Roman Empire of iron (iron signifying power and great destructive force against opposition) was to be made of two main divisions. And it certainly was for the empire literally split into two-East and West. Both were very powerful , crushing all before them.\n \n \n \n But as the glory and power of all empires fail, so this empire began to fall also. Thus Rome Fell. Pagan Imperial Rome was no longer iron. She crumbled. She was wounded to death. Rome could not now rule . It was all over. So thought the world. But how wrong the word was , for that head(Rome) though wounded unto death ( Wust, translation of Rev. 13:3, \"And one of his heads appeared to have been mortally wounded, the throat having been slashed. And the whole earth followed after the the Wild Beast in amazement.\")\n \n People look at Rome. They look at the nation of Italy. And as they look they do not realize that Rome with her strict confines where the pope has an actual area as his domain is literally a nation within a nation, and she has ambassadors, and receives ambassadors PAPAL FALSE CHRISTIAN ROME( she is even called the eternal city -how blasphemous ) NOW CONTROLS BY RELIGION EVEN MORE ABLY THAN WHEN PAGAN IMPERIAL ROME CONTROLLED BY THE PURE IRON OF FORCE.. Rome took on a new lease of life when Constantine joined church and state and backed the union by force. The spirit that motivated pagan Rome is the same spirit that now motivates false Christian Rome. You can see that is so because you now know that the fourth empire never went out of existence; it just changed ins outer texture.\n \n Once the Nicene Council had swung the power of political Rome to the church, it seemed that there were no limits to which this First Christian Church would go. The name, Christian, which originally brought persecution, now became the name of the persecutors. It was in this age that Augustness Of Hippo(354-430) set forth the precept that the church ought and MUST use force if necessary to bring her children back into the fold, and that it was in harmony with the Word of God to kill the heretics and apostates. In his controversy with the Donatists he wrote.......\"It' is indeed better that men should be led to worship God by teaching than that they should be driven to it by fear of punishment or pain, but it does not follow that because the former course produces the better men , therefore those who do not yield to it should be neglected. For many have found advantage( as we have proved and are daily proving by actual experience) in being first compelled by fear or pain , so that they might afterwards be influenced by teaching , so they might follow out in act what they have already learned in word..... whilst those are better who are guided aright by love, those are certainly more numerous who are corrected by fear. For who can possibly love us more than Christ, Who laid down His life for the sheep?Yet after calling Peter and the other apostles by His words alone, when He came to summon Paul, He not only constrained him with His voice, but even dashed him to the earth with His power; and that He might forcibly bring one who is raging amidst the darkness of infidelity , to desire the light of the heart, HE FIRST STRUCK HIM WITH PHYSICAL BLindness of the eyes. Why therefore should not the church use force in compelling her lost sons to return? The Lord Himself said, 'Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in'. Wherefore if the power which the Church has received by divine appointment in it's due season, through the religious character and faith of kings, be the instruments by which those who are found in the highways and hedges- that is in heresies and schisms- are compelled to come in , then let not them find fault with being compelled.\n \n \n The thirst for blood was growing apace. The false vine in Spain now played upon the e Emperor Maximus to join in the attack upon the true believers who had the Word and the signs wonders with them. Thus some Priscillianists were brought to Treves by Bishop Ithacus (385) He accused them of witchcraft and immorality and many were executed. Martin of Tours, and Ambrose of Milan Protested this , and pleaded in vain for the persecution to cease. When the persecution was prolonged these two bishops refused to fellowship with Bishop Hydatua and others like him . Strange to say the Synod in Treves approved of the murder's\n \n From this time on, especially through the Dark Ages, we will see the children of the flesh persecute and destroy the children of the Spirit, though both claim one Father EVEN AS With IN THE CASE of ISHAMAEL. The darkness of spiritual corruption will deepen and the true light of God will fade until number wise it glows ever so faintly. Yet the promise of God will hold true, \"The light shineth in darkness and the darkness can do nothing about it.\"\n \n \n Now up to this time I have not brought out that point in history that I promised to cover , that is , the intermingling of the religion of NImrod and the Christian religion. You will recall that Attalus fled from Babylon to Pergamos and set up his kingdom from outside the reached of the Roman Empire. It flourished over the years, nurtured by the god of this world. A succession of priest kings followed Attalus until the reign of Attalus III when for reasons known only in the sovereignty of God he willed the kingdom to Rome. Julius Caesar then took both the kingdom physical and spiritual for he became Pontiff Maximus of the Babylonish religion ands was therefore priest-king. This title passed on to the following emperors until the time of Maximus III who refused it. According to Stevens' \" History it was then that the Pope took the headship the emperor rejected and today there is still a pontiff in the e world, and he is truly pontiff Maximus . He wears a triple crown and resides in Rome. And in Rev.17 God does not any longer refer to Pergamos as Satan's seat nor does he say that is where Satan dwells . No, the throne room is no longer in Pergamos, but it is Mystery Babylon. It is not in Babylon but in Mystery Babylon. It is a city on seven hills. It's head is anti- christ for he has usurped the position of Christ. Who alone is mediator and Who alone can forgive sins. Yes, Pontiff Maximus is with us today\n \n \n Excerpt( Seven Church Ages/W.Branham)",
