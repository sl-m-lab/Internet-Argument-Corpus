   "Chicago is, naturally, going to blame the laxer gun laws of the rest of Illinois, licensed dealers operating just outside of city limits, and neighboring states that don't share the same laws of Chicago, for this matter. They're gonna try and point the finger at other people who were nowhere near the city when this went down, make it like it's the fault of somebody else entirely.\n \n I've got news for Chicago supporters. It's not the job of the rest of the state, or the rest of America, to ensure that they have the same laws as you just so your laws are uniform cover vast distances. If you can't run your own city with the passage of such inane laws that aren't in effect anywhere else, then get rid of them and embrace the rest of the state in how they do things. You're doing nothing but setting yourself up for fail by sticking out like a sore thumb.",
