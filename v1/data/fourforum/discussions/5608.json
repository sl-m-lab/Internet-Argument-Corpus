NYT running 18 month old stories on missing amunitions and trying to pass it off as \"breaking\" news 6 days before an election is as close as you can get to some media outlets \"advertising\" for their boss - John Kerry.\n\n \n For the sake of argument I'll accept a liberal bias in some media outlets, like the NYT. The thing is, the NYT did not actually \"work\" for Kerry or the Dems. Neither Kerry nor the Dems could call up the NYT and say \"run a piece on global warming next Tuesday, and be sure to use the phrase 'desert in Nebraska' at least three times\", and expect it to happen. They might run the piece if it looked like a good story, but they wouldn't allow the exact wording to be dictated to them. However, that's exactly what the GOP is doing with their media empire. For example, when the Mass. gay marriage ruling came down, the conservative thinks tanks put their heads together and came up with the phrase \"activist judges\". And it was a great phrase. There were no activist judges, of course, but that's beside the point. The phrase accomlished the short term goal of allowing the GOP to take a stance against gay marriage without mentioning gays, and it helped with the long term goal of pushing for the nomination of more conservative judges. Once they came up with the phrase it was sent out, and within days in was being used by every republican politician who could get in front of a camera, on conservative radio stations across the country, and in mass e-mailings. The GOP have become very slick about this. They come up with phrases that frame the debate in a way favorable to them, and then get that phrase diseminated everywhere. Even people who oppose the GOP point of view end up using their language to discuss the issues, and by using your opponents language you're just reinforcing your opponents assumptions, and the battle is already half lost.",

Right?\n That's the logic right?\n\n No. That mean old Israel throwing it's weight around unprovoked.\n \n \nIsraeli War of Independence (1948-1949)\n Upon independence, Israel was invaded by the armies of six Arab nations: Egypt, Syria, Transjordan (later Jordan), Lebanon, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. In addition, local Arab Palestinian forces also fought the Jewish Israelis.\n \n Palestinian-Israeli Conflict (1960-Present)\n This includes the Palestinian guerrilla warfare against Israel from the 1960's, original Intifada (1988-1992) and the current \"Al-Aqsa\" Intifada (2000-Present).\n Israel faced guerrilla and terrorist warfare from several Palestinian armies, most of whom united under the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), led by Yassir Arafat. Current fighting involves Israel against more religiously militant groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad, as well as against Arafat's Palestinian Authority.\n \n The Yom Kippur (Ramadan) War (1973)\n In a surprise attack launched on the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday (the dates also fell on the Muslim Ramadan holiday), Egypt and Syria attacked Israel. Despite aid from Iraq, the Arab forces failed to defeat Israel.\n \n The Israeli Invasion of Lebanon (1982-1984)\n In response to repeated guerrilla attacks by the PLO, which were launched from South Lebanon, Israel invaded with the intent of destroying Arafat's forces. Syria, which maintained a large army in Lebanon, fought Israel and suffered an embarrassing defeat.\n \n The Second Persian Gulf War (1991)--While Israel took no offensive action in this war, Iraq did launch Scud missiles which struck Israel and almost caused Israel's intervention in the Gulf War.\n In an attempt to goad Israel into retaliating, Iraq launched Scud missiles at Israel during the Second Persian Gulf War. Under pressure from the United States, which sent Patriot missiles to Israel to defend against the Scuds, Israel refrained from launching attacks on Iraq. The Iraqi goal in this was to force Israel into the war, which may have caused the Arab members of the anti-Iraq coalition to quit he war or even switch sides.\n\n You're comparing apples and oranges.",

Well done!\n \n What you don't get is the concept of constrained resources. Let's try an example. You have 1 million dollars, and you're going to use it to save lives. You have two options. You can use it all to save 1 life, or you can use it all to save 1000 lives. Which do you choose? Obviously, you save the 1000 lives. Saving one life is good, but saving 1000 lives is so much better that just saving the one life would, in fact, be a mistake. If you have two options, and you choose the option that does the least good, then you've made the wrong choice.\n \n Now do you understand that merely doing some good isn't enough? When you're dealing with limited resources the correct choice is to maximize the good you do with what you have. If you do a small amount of good when you could have done a much larger amount of good, then your choice was wrong. That's why I kept asking you if such-and-such a result was more important than fighting terrorism. If fighting terrorism is the most important thing, and you seem to believe it is, then the correct choice is to use your resources to fight terrorism. If you use them for something less important, even if it does do some small amount of good, then you've make a mistake. Whatever small good the war has done, fighting terrorism would have been a greater good, therefore we've been wasting our resources, and the war is a mistake.",

   "I meant in this country and I grieve for every American killed in Iraq....That said I would rather fight terrrorists in the streets of Baghdad then in the streets of New York..........\n\n \n The only problem with this is that people in baghdad would ratehr we fought our war on our turf and killed our civilians. They do not want to die in order to keep Americans blissfully unaware of our terrible foreign policy or the enemies that it makes us. \n \n Sure, you would rather see Iraqis die than americans die, but the Iraqis donet seem to like that plan. Sure, you would rather see train bombings in Madirid than in the New Yorkl subway tunnels, but the spaniards apparently disagree. \n \n Every civilian that ends up dead due to our policy of misdirection in a war that we essentailly started by supporting tyrants and despots, we make enemies. As we make more enemies, or at least loose the goodwill we had with other nations, AQ get stronger. They now have more people, and more money, than they did on 9/11/01, despite the arests we have made. And the arrests are startign to dwindle because other nations have stopped helping at the previous level. Apparently they do nto want to become the new target. they don't want to sacrafice their civilian population in order to keep the US from taking the well deserved hit that we have worked so hard to earn. \n \n Anybody who does not understand why anti US terrorists are popping up all over the world is rather obviously ignorant of history.\n \n Monday I got an Email from a buddy of mine at DSWA. It was rather widely circulated int he intelligence community as a major event. I don't know why the media didn't pick it up, I can only assume it is becuase the implications are so terrifying.\n \n Apparently AQ has formed ties with Columbian guerillas, and despite peace talks, there are more columbian guerillas than ever as our (the US) campaign of spraying groundkiller over half the nation makes us more enemies. With the Columibina guerillas as allies, AQ now has access to their netowrk of linked groups, or essentially all of south america. Additionally, the columbian guerillas finance their activities by importing hundreds of tons of drugs intot he US each year. It would be nothign for these guys to shipo a dozen operatives, weapons of any kind, or even nukes, into the US undetected. \n \n All the airport anal probes int he world are now pointless. With that connection, AQ has unfettered access to the united states, as well as an entire continet to satge operations from where the populations of most naitons are markedly anti US.",

   "Clinton treated terrorist attacks like a police action..........\n\n \n If I really felt the urge to blame an ex-president for 9-11, as opposed to the guy who was actually on watch when it happened, I'd have to blame Reagan. After all, he was the one who authorized and funded training Bin Laden in terrorism. Of course, he was only supposed to practice it on the USSR, but then long range planning often runs afoul of short term goals, doesn't it?",
