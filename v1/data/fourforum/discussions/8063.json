It's amazing Esmie did not snap sooner. I see this as just as much, if not more, the parents fault than anybody else.\n\n \n I had the same sort of thing happen to me. Luckily after years of forced overachievement, never having friends or a life outside of school and organised activities, I had another home to go to because my parents had been divorced. \n \n The twisted thing about these \"pushed\" children is that they are most often pretty well-behaved and cooperative kids to begin with. Usually such children have a healthy natural drive to succeed. This means that the child often internalises his or her parents' strictures, and spends much of their lives truly feeling like a failure for earning grades for which any other child would be praised. The pushed child, because he or she wishes to please their parents and do well, becomes the accomplice of their own abuse. I know that in my case, the overwhelming sense of betrayal I felt when I finally saw my parents' abuses for what they were filled me in those last days before I left my father's house with a dangerous rage. This was compounded by an immense self-loathing comprised of my latent sense of having failed in my school and other work, and a further feeling of having been duped.\n \n Honestly, I do not see much differrance between a girl in such a situation (with the added incitements of sexual abuses) who killed a parent, and my self whose rage was able to defuse due to the opportunity to leave the abusive enviornment. My father and I have a good (if strained) relationship now, and I am glad that we never came to this level of violence. I acknowlege, however, that this was exactly the kind of thing that very well might have happened to me under differrant circumstances eleven and a half years ago.\n \n OK, one big differrance: This girl murdered someone. I am not denying that. I am denying that she had an adult's mental competance at the time the crime occurred. I am going to further deny that a person who kills under such extraordinary circumstances is likely to be a danger to society in the future. The girl definitely would require a course of psychotherapy, deprogramming, and possible many years of psychiatric drug treatment; but I am sure that such a person could be made safe and functional with time.\n \n So, if the public is safe, and the girl can be rehabillitated, what other motive does the state have in this case? Retaliation? To set an example?\n \n Is this a crime for which we would wish to retaliate as a society? While I would be the last person to hold this girl up as a hero for what she has done, I would also not condemn her. I am personally content to treat incidents such as these as mere misfortunes. I can deal with a world where occasionally people are placed in extrordinarily bad situations, and bad acts are the result. People get hit crossing the street, electrocute themselves while changing a light bulb, are sent to war and do things they would never do in their normal lives, or find themselves in a certain place at a certain time and meet brutality with brutality. I weep that these things happen, but I am not so naive as to immagine that their like will ever be eradicated from the human experiance.\n \n Do we need to set an example of abuser-killers? Maybe. We certainly need to maintain a state where abuse can not be claimed post-facto by anyone who kills a family member. On the other hand, I trust that the mental health and legal establishments can sepperate spurious abuse claims by defendants from legitimate ones. I am also confident that a jury, if instructed to weigh the abuse as a mitigating or exculpatory element, will be able to judge on a common-sense basis when legitimised examples of abuse as a prvocation are severe enough to excuse the resulting retaliatory crime.\n \n The question which remains even efter we have excused this particular killer is why and when we wish to try juvenile offenders as adults.\n \n I propose that this business of adult trials for juveniles furthers two terrible flaws in the way our society currently metes out punnishments on the whole. \n 1 ) We punnish the wrong people the most.\n 2 ) We have a fundamntally sick view of what punnishment is and ought to be.\n \n The crimes we punnish most harshly fall into two categories: non-violent drug crimes and uniquely atrocious crimes. The preposterous sentances which arise from the federal minimum sentancing guidlines which multiply required years of incarceration by the quantity of drugs involved have, I am sure, been covered adequately elsewhere.What I am most concerned with are atrocious crimes; crimes which have high emotional appeal either because of the nature of the victim or the brutality of the act. When we are talking about a case like the one at hand, we must understand that it's harsher prosecution has resulted from the fact that the accused killed her mother. If she had instead been the trigger-person in a gang-motivated drive-by shooting we would never have heard of her and she would not be at all likely to be tried as an adult. Compare this to the fact that one can only kill their mother once, and having done so are unlikely to find themselves in a situation in the future where the same sort of act would be motivated, whereas a gang-member will most likely find themselves repeatedly called upon by their gang to use violence. \n \n The people who we need to fear, the people for whom prisons are built, are career criminals. If you want to try a child as an adult and lock them away for many years, you should choose the child who as committed multiple offenses, who has done so for profit or as part of a gang. That child has shown himself to be a career criminal and is the one who most likely will inflict future damage upon society. \n \n The person who commits the more shocking sorts of crimes is most likely motivated by extreme distress under unique circumstances. This latter sort of child is not all together that likely to commit future such acts, and other such children are not likely to weigh previous harsh punnishments that the state has delivered in making the decision to commit their own (fundamentally unreasoned) crimes.\n \n The sickness of our curent practice of criminal punnishment is also founded on a grave misunderstanding of what punnishment is. A culture has developed in the US which treats punnishments as victories. This is profoundly immoral. No matter how damaging a crime is, incarceration or execution remain themselves a form of damage. There is no good that comes of a prison year served. Imprisonment is always a harm. It harms the convict, it costs society, and it harms the family members of the convict. It is often necessary to imprison or execute a person, but, like homicide in wartime, that punnishment is itself never a positive thing. At best it is a necessary evil. If people can come to understand that a crime and it's punnishment are not a victory for justice, but rather are just a ballanced sort of tragedy, then maybe our reflex as a body pollitic will not always be to increase punnishments, stiffen laws, and expand the responsibillity of juveniles. \n \n More punnishment does not mean more justice.",

I believe that it is generally accepted that juveniles have different, less devleoped thought processes than adults. This is why we do not allow them to drink, smoke, vote, live alone, or sign contracts. Until you are an adult, you essentially have no rights, they are rather exercised by proxy through your parental units. We do this because children are....dumb. Most teenagers in particular do not posses the sense that god gave to a little green apple.\n \n That said, Some are better than others when it comes to the cognative abilities department. BUT, how well developed a persons thought processes are is widely an area of speculation or opinion. If we are going to argue that children should be tried as adults if we believe that their thought processes are mature enough, we would, by proxy, have to give children the right to vote, drink, smoke, sign contracts, live aloe, etc... if they could show that they possesed a high level of cognative ability. \n \n We set a line, an age, becuase it is the best way we have come up with to deal with things. It does not always serve justice particularly well....I have known some 35 yr olds that function at a 14 yr old level, but we have to put a line somewhere. Putting a line at 18 for prosecuting people as adults is no different form putting a line at 18 for them to vote. It is an arbitrary number that we believe provides a high likelyhood of accomplishing the goals we wish to achieve.",

What else could she do? She reports it? Most likely the mother punishes her more, and the dad would take over raising her. Who knows what he was like? You hear a lot about people like her committing suicide, at least she attacked the root of the problem, her parent. I have said that in cases of suicide like this (there was actually a recent local case where a \"model\" student committed suicide. Everyone said \"no one could see it coming\". And I said of course not, because the expectations were so high, which is why he killed himself.) the parent is as much to blame for the suicide as the kid, if not more so. The kid killed himself because they'd rather no live at all than live the life they have now. How do you think they got that way? \n \n Obviously you can say that she shouldn't have, but honestly what would you have done in her shoes? Would you truly have called child abuse or whatever? (I don't know where I'd call, I'd have to google it to find a number). Would you really put your trust in a system accusing your mom when she beats you every time you don't get a perfect? When you're that scared of her you'd try to turn her in? You ever think about what would happen if she got off? What if it didn't qualify as child abuse? I don't know what I would do in that situation, but I would definately entertain killing her, and it would be higher on my list than calling child abuse. Also on the list would be sticking it out for 2 more years until I was 18, running away, suicide, and talking (although I would suspect she talked with her mom first). It's easy to say \"just go for help\" from the outside, but put yourself in her shoes. What would you do?",

I would say they turn to abuse themselves, be that outward abuse or inward abuse. What kind of abuse? Depends, some people will use drugs, some will abuse alcohol, some people resort to violence, some people to suicide, some people to other addictions, sex, gambling, eating, you name it, we've done it, and some people resort to killing another human being.\n \n Killing another human being shouldn't be the option we choose. We really need to teach our kids, that they can reach out easily to social services and find help. I know our social service system is broken, if the girl would've called more than likely they would not have provided a \"safe haven\" for her. Even if the mother was tried in courts, our own courts would probably slap her with community service. Everything is broken!!!\n \n The girl should have never killed her mom.\n\n as a result of an abusive home, you listed some options many children take, either to cope with the situation, or to continue the self-inflcted pain they have become accustomed to. you point out that killing the person who caused the abuse is the wrong option. which option you listed would be better?\n \n if you ask me, abusive parents have it easy. and of course, this kind of abuse is very hard to detect, because it usually comes with the noble intentions of wanting to see your child succeed. who wouldnt want that for their kids. it may be because esmie's mother saw herself as not maximising her academic opportunities and regretting it severely. perhaps esmie's mother felt like a failure to her parents, and wanted to prevent esmie from feeling that way about herself, by driving her to self-perfection. its inevitable that a dysfunctional parent will lead a dysfunctional home.\n \n of course i believe that esmie should not have killed her mother. but i personally dont think that option is worse than her committing suicide or turning to drug addiction.\n \n \nThe thing is. Now what? Maybe we should have seperate prison according to age. This girl is going to be out in about 8 years, so I hope we understand that she is going to be a part of our society, and I hope we don't let her be another statistic. She does have a lot to offer, we all do, and how we treat her the next eight years in prison, will probably reflect if she becomes a contributing member of society, or someone in and out of jail and or rehab.\n\n well the fact that she is in the spotlight right now, getting either hate or sympathy from society, is already a step in a bad direction that she will have to work that much harder to overcome. her release from prison will be followed by the press, and the debate will be sparked again. its messed up really bad as it is. somehow, amidsts her oppressed programming, she will have to find the resolve within herself to prove to the world that she is still the scholar, musical genius and A-class person she was 8 years before. the odds are stacked against her, but its not by any means hopeless",

   "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4967340.stm\n \n Thats a link to the story of 16 year old Esmie Tseng, who was tried and will be sentenced as an adult. Granted, when you read the story, her crime was pretty bad (killing her mother), but given the circumstances, and the fact that she is only 16, to be put in an adult prison for the next 8 and a half years is mind boggling. This girl will be suffer 10x worse in there than what she had to go through at home.\n \n This trend of punishing minors as adults is starting to get worrying. We have a juvenile justice system for a reason, because juveniles think differently than adults, you cant just ram rod them into the adult system and then pat ourselves on the back for a job well done. Esmie is not a threat to society, and if anything, it could be argued she was provoked. She should be put in a juvenile detention facility until she is 21, and sentenced to counseling, not 8 years of hard time where there is a high chance she'll be assaulted, abused, raped or worse.\n\n She only got 8.5 years? Wow, I was hoping for 20yrs minimum.\n \n Justice still needs to be paid no matter what age the person is.",

To the person that was killed, the age is rather irrelevant because she still killed. Whether it ruins the life of the 16yr old is kind of a bad point because won't it ruin the life of a 25yr old too? I hardly have sympathy for someone that kills anyway...\n \n There should be some truth to the idea that justice is blind.",
