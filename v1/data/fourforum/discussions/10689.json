   "It's kind of surreal that this discussion is even taking place, really. That someone would even look at a situation where someone was killed of whom there's no indication they had done anything to deserve it, and then rather than feeling sorry for the victims or showing some empathy, saying instead that they've reaped what they've sown just 'cause it happened to have taken place inside a certain church building, is sorta disturbing. Until such time as it's determined the motivation of the shooter had anything to do with the fact the victims or the church had spoken out against homosexuality, the post about this event doesn't even belong in the gay rights forum. It belongs in the crime forum. This has got to be one of the more shocking threads I've seen in a long time here.\n\n \n Yeah, but look who posted this thread. The gay crusading hatemonger Matthew who considers anyone who happens to disagree with his lifestyle for ANY reason as an avowed enemy who deserves to die the most brutal death imaginable. Matthew shows, just as lesz does that they haven't the capacity for sympathy or empathy within them. They only understand what satisfies their own lusts and personal needs as they resent and hate anyone who sees life differently than they do. \n \n So because Christians believe all sins of the flesh are wrong and damage those who practice them, whether those sins are committed by straights or gays, then according to these extremists then ALL CHRISTIANS MUST THEREFORE HATE ALL GAYS which means christians deserve to die and are only reaping what they sow as the article from their hate based and bigoted website suggests. \n \n It doesn't matter to these haters of truth that christians speak out against all sins of the flesh and not just gay sex. All that matters to them is that they are perceived victims of a righteous perspective of life so therefore will applaud and celebrate the deaths of innocent people who God knows had nothing but love, empathy and concern in their hearts for the self destructive lifestyle of homosexuality, if they thought about it at all.And by the way, the death toll is up to 5 now, that oughta make your day, huh?\n \n http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22897903-23109,00.html",

However, they are guilty by association IMHO, they knew full and well what that message of the church they chose to accept was, and they believed the church's message of hate.

Most Christians wouldn't dream of arguing to be able to fire somebody just cause they are Jewish, and wouldn't openly discuss how we have to legislate against \"Jews\" in order to protect \"families\" or similar nonsense. The general idea of legislating against Jews would be repulsive.\n There are no complaints of \"force\" because the government protects Jews from discrimination.\n It would be surprising to see one Christian tell a co-worker \n But, according to Christian dogma, not believing in God, or more explicitly Jesus, would be a sin.\n \n Yet on the flip side, \"homosexuality\" is a sin where we openly talk about how they have to be converted, they shouldn't have the same rights or else \"family values\" are \"threatened\". Yadda, yadda, yadda...\n \n If you take a FURTHER parallel regarding the claim of some with a \"war on Christianity\", you don't have the wide-spread condemnation of Christians that you see with gays. To put it another way, I can't see how anybody can claim a \"war on Christianity\" by any standard which wouldn't also clearly define that a \"war on gays\" exists...\n \n With all that said, none of the above excuses the senseless murders which took place.\n I make the above observations regarding the \"reap what you sow\" mentality to show what was \"sown\", but this is nowhere near a proportional response.\n \n Hypothetical talk of forbidding Christians to adopt because of their \"mental\" problems. Hypothetical talk of praising \"ex-Christians\" who left their previous \"chosen\" life of ignorance. Hypothetical talk of wanting to respect the \"rights\" of others who don't want to employ Christians because of personal condemnation of their \"lifestyle choice\".\n Those would be proportional. (And \"hypothetical\" is stressed because I support none of those...)\n \n And on the flip-side of the issue, if these murders are associated with a \"gay\" thing, there is more of an issue of how some will try to have something \"reaped\" based on what the murderer(s) have \"sown\".",

   "I agree. There's passionate, and then there's loonie.\n \n While both sides have immediately taken up their extreme (and predictable) stances on the situation, as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n \n No one deserves to be MURDERED for their beliefs. In fact we have laws that guarantee a person's right to believe as they wish. This was murder, plain and simple, regardless of the motivation or \"justification\", and to equate it to the fight against terrorism, on any level, is absurd. We have law enforcement and criminal courts designed to deal with this, not vigilantes. \n \n That being said, I can also see the \"you reap what you sow\" element, and I don't know how anyone can honestly say they don't see it. I don't condone the action, far from it, but it certainly doesn't suprise me. When you preach and inflame hate, you shouldn't be suprised when people become inflamed and hate. \n \n As to the victims being innocent - I agree, they are technically innocent of any crime. However, they are guilty by association IMHO, they knew full and well what that message of the church they chose to accept was, and they believed the church's message of hate. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been parishoners there. IMHO, there are no truly \"innocent\" members of such a church.\n \n Waxy\n\n Would this logic work if you switched the situation and have the person who killed a homosexual say \"well if you go against God's word then this kinda thing is going to happen so its a reap what you sow thing\".\n \n I doubt that is any better logic then saying what you see as hate (because it isn't hate to all of us) makes it so this kinda thing will happen.",

This logic would only work if you see going against religious fanaticism and hate as an unhealthy thing. \n \n \nI doubt that is any better logic then saying what you see as hate (because it isn't hate to all of us) makes it so this kinda thing will happen.\n\n \n It is hate, however. We don't exclude or promote non-acceptance of people we like, or towards which we have a neutral attitude. Those who claim to love gays as people, only love the gay people who renounce reject or repress what makes them different and gay, in the first place. It doesn't take long debating with anti-gays before the hate and ignorance is exposed.\n \n You know, there was a tradition in Canada, called native residential schools. The government and church worked together to try to get native people to act white. They wanted to get the little heathen/pagan/native out of the natives. I'm sure it was called love, non-bigoted, morally correct, healthy, saving from destruction/damnation. God is great, there can be no doubt. It's an example of how we all love and accept others.",

He is just living his own life in a way that is supposedly contradictory to \"God\".\n If the gay person were doing something TO GOD, then you would have more of a point in the response... Although, your example still lacks the parallel that a SEPARATE PERSON has taken it upon themselves to react in God's stead.\n \n The \"reaping\" is an act of murderous hatred, but the gay person did not \"sow\" that to the person who is \"reaping\".\n \n The phrase \"sowing what you reap\" is similar to the concept of \"those who live by the sword, die by the sword\".\n The whole issue involves a \"karmic\" type response, which is completely lacking in the example you try to throw out there.",

   "But then it would only make sense if their attack were levied at those they were taught to hate. It doesn't fit here in this situation because the attacker wasn't shooting at gay people. That's the thing.\n\n \n Well, many Christians do attack gay people. But the point is that they are being taught not merely a target, but that it is righteous to attack. So when, as in this case, they have been personally hurt or rejected (as this person apparently saw it) by their church, they lash out against it, because they've been taught that this is OK to do. It's not that the attacks were truly justifiable, but once someone thinks they have the Lord behind them, they can wreak havoc with good conscience.\n \n \nLook, this whole karma-based canard idea of 'reap-what-you-sow' 'reap-the-wind' thing doesn't really mean anything.

And there is no reason to think the event was more likely to have happened at THIS church than a church that DIDN'T teach anti-gay things.\n\n \n I do think that karma is real. Oh, not in a metaphysical sense, but people have to operate in the atmosphere they create, and if that atmosphere happens occasionally to work against their interests, they have no-one to blame but themselves. It was not the homophobia that created this atmosphere. It was the sense of self-righteous judgmentalism common to many Christian denominations.\n \n This isn't unique to Christianity, of course, but Christianity doesn't seem at all immune from it. Would this person have acted some other way were it not for his experience at the hands of this church? Well, we can't know for sure, but he is just the latest in a long line of individuals who have committed an atrocity from a religious background.\n \n Now, when an atheist does something like this, I note that all religious apologists bar none rush to say that \"godlessness\" was the cause of whatever havoc. It's banning god from schools and government that apparently causes scheiss to happen. Here we have a counter example.\n \n Now, I think that atheists do have a responsibility to articulate why atheism doesn't and shouldn't lead to crimes against humanity -- and we certainly accept that challenge and act on it. I have not stinted my efforts to demonstrate that secular philosophy should be humanitarian. The godful have a similar responsibility, and when it happens on their watch, they need to accept the same degree of responsibility they expect atheists to accept whenever someone godless goes off the rails. Atheists and the religious are in principle no more or less moral than the other, because we all get our moral sense from the same source: our evolved humanity. \n \n But here we have an example of a self-righteous religion spawning an individual who bit right back, because that religion denied the humanity and dignity of gay people and other heathen they taught others to despise. In doing that, they taught the principle that it is righteous to despise and hurt those we disagree with, or are different from. They certainly didn't teach respect or dignity.

   "Jim, dear, I've never denied being an atheist, nor have I concealed my dim view of the modern practice of Christianity. I think most churches are appalling, including the New Life church where this tragedy occurred. I am just pointing out the reluctance of modern Christians to take responsibility for the hatred their beliefs generate.\n...and you dump all Christians into the same bag. Your generalizations weaken your argument in the eyes of any reader who knows better...Christian or not.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Well, it was also Christians who came up with the idea that AIDS was god's punishment against gays. \n I already said it was stupid...but it has never been that ALL Christians held that view...something you keep lying about everytime you generalize. \n \n \nIt's all part of the same pattern of hatred. Christianity preaches hatred, whatever Christ preached 2000 years ago. \nChrist didn't preach hatred. You generalize again.\n \n \nThat's the point: Christianity has little to do with Christ, and that pattern has held for generation after generation.\nYou generalize so well.\n \n \nAs you Christian apologists keep telling us, we live in a \"Christian nation\". Yet it has one of the highest incidences of people bringing in guns to blow other people away.\nGeneralizing again.\n \n \n \n\n I've given a lifetime of thought to Christianity, and I've judged it repugnant.\nYour lifetime is not over. You should be more considerate of those around you. You should stop generalizing by blaming ALL Christians for the mistakes of others.\n \n \n \n\n Go ahead, keep defending the indefensible. With every post you dig yourself deeper into the culture of hatred.\nGeneralizing again.\n \n \n \n\n All the mean spirit is on the side of Christian religion. As an unrepentant apologist for it, you share that spirit. There is nothing of Christ in modern Christianity. But you defend this hollow shell, anyway.\n...and again. You wouldn't know what a congregation of Christians could offer you in the way of love and support because you're too convinced of your own absolute correctness regarding the hatred that you think lives in the heart of each person who calls himself a Christian to even bother with a visit to check it out. You bask in your own sunlight.\n \n \nIf only Desmond Tutu and others like him represented modern Christianity. Unfortunately, modern Christianity is represented by the likes of Ted Haggard, James Dobson, Franklin Graham and Herr Ratzinger, et al. They aren't merely \"bad apples\", they are the main contents of the barrel.\n Gee, you named three whole people there. I doubt that any one of their congregations is 100% in agreement with everything they say. I'd also say it's highly likely that some of their members are gay/lesbian.\n \n \n \n\n Yes, there are a few decent Christian leaders and institutions out there. There's Soulforce, the Metropolitan Community church, the UCC, and a few minor denominations or individual congregations or pastors. The Episcopalians in the main and Quakers aren't bad, and Unitarian Universalists are usually good, too, though not all of them are Christians. But these guys aren't mainstream Christianity these days.\nYou've mistakenly identified publicized Christianity for mainstream Christianity.\n \n http://www.cpcatlanta.org/index_layer.html\n \n http://www.gaychurch.org/Find_a_Church/find_a_church.htm\n \n http://www.gaychurch.org/Find_a_Church/united_states/united_states.htm\n \n http://gaylife.about.com/od/religion/a/gaychurch.htm\n \n \n http://www.churchmarketingsucks.com/archives/2005/10/gay-friendly_ch.html\n \n Those came from a list of 580,000 hits on google for gay friendly churches. Maybe you should spend some time getting to know these kinds of people before you start labeling all Christians as haters of gays and lesbians.\n \n If you can come up with a number of followers for you badboy-hate preachers, I can probably exceed that number with followers of Christ in gay friendly churches.\n \n Your argument is salt and vinegar.\n \n \n \nIt's not that I'm \"not getting it\", it's that I reject your apologia as bogus. The vast majority of Christians on the ground don't give a damn either way, though more often than not, they'll follow their shepherds like the sheeple they are to find out what they're supposed to think. I have to deal with the face of Christianity presented to me most often by Christian churches, and that is a mask of hatred.\nGeneralizing again. You have been proven wrong here already. Why do you continue to generalize?\n \n \n \n\n I regret that is the way I see Christianity, and perhaps it ought not to be what Christianity should be. It's what I feel Christianity is, or has been made by Christians. They aren't forced to believe some of the hateful things they believe; they have a choice about it. That they choose wrongly says it all.\nYou only think you know Christians. Check out a gay friendly Christian church in your local area. I gave you a global menu site. Pick one and visit it...get to know some of the members, the leaders, then come back and tell me there are no Christians who act like Christ would toward you.\n \n \nWell at least you're making progress, because merely a day ago you were condemning Christianity in general--the whole thing: from Desmond Tutu and everyone--making NO allowance for ANYONE. Some progress is better than none, I suppose. Perhaps you realised how unreasonable you were sounding.\n \n You still clearly have a messed up view. Most Christians in the world don't do a thing to bother you, and you're assuming the voices of a few leaders who happen to be very vocal represent all Christians. You ONLY want Christians to have to shoulder blame for them, absolving yourself of any responsibility to your judgment and not generalise, but you've been told the truth here many times, and so at this point it's up to YOU to use your brain on this. The number of leaders you named can be counted on one hand. That should tell you something. There are millions--yes, millions of pastors out there, and many more parishoners who are just doing their own thing. They don't deserve your condemnation, and most reasonable people know this.\n \n \n \n That doesn't really matter. Truth doesn't depend on what YOU reject; I can't help it if you're being unreasonable and instead are determined to irrationally generalise.\nThat it his biggest error...generalizing.\n \n \nThis is a fantasy of your own imagination. I have never condemned all Christians, and frequently said there are some that aren't bad. Ted Haggard's New Life church wasn't among them.\n \n When the majority of Christian churches cease their vicious and hateful propaganda against gays, come tell me again how wonderful they are. I might even be prepared to be convinced.\nYou might check previous posts before claiming not to have condemned all Christians. You've done it several times. Check out the links I gave you. Google it yourself. It's quite simple.\n \n \nI've qualified over and over again, and see no need to it especially for you in every post. \n \n \n \n Need I quote the hateful things the Vatican has said about gays? Need I quote the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant grouping in the US? Or even the bilge that the New Life church preached under its disgraced ex-pastor, Ted Haggard?

   "I didn't respond to this because like all of your posts it is extreme to the point of ridiculous Matt. Voting against same sex marriage is democracy in action as it relates to the people voting for a social issue that is important to National Morality. It is the people exercising their will in a lawful way in order to prevent extremism from dominating reason and common sense. \n \n The Japanese Internment and the destruction of the Native American WAS NOT IN ANY WAY THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND NEITHER DID THEY VOTE TO INTERN THE JAPANESE AMERICANS DURING WWII. So as usual, your analogy doesn't work at all. And if Arabs in America are collected and locked up for National Security reasons, with all of the power of big brother to know what and how we live, I doubt I would be targeted at all. Due to the anti christian sentiments that exist today I would be more concerned about being targeted as a born again believer someday in America than for being an arab.\n\n \n Yet the native american removals and putting them on reservations were the will of the people at the time.\n \n I bet that if some one put detaining Mexican illegals into detention camp was put on the ballot in the southwest states I am sure it would pass.\n \n My point is if you put civil rights on the ballot then were does it stop?\n \n If you live by the tyranny of the majority you will die by the tyranny of majorty.",

Can't you debate honestly ever? The Federal Government never put the issue of Reservations for the Indians on any ballots at all. That was a federal decision all the way and the will or support of the people was never sought. And regarding the Illegal Mexicans, we already have detention camps in Cali and Arizona, I think it is, but they are full to overflowing and can't hold anymore people. And once again, they exist according to Federal Policy and no Americans voted for their creation. And by the way Matt, illegally breaking into this Country is against our laws so they should be treated like criminals rather than visiting dignitaries so if put on a ballot, it should pass as what is happening on the southern border each day is on par with a foreign invasion.",

If we are gay and accept ourselves, we are automatically excommunicated by virtue of our refusal to renounce our alleged \"sin\". But yes, there are plenty of gay people who regard themselves as Catholic. (I am not one.) However, it's questionable whether anyone who does not accept papal authority absolutely and unquestionably would be regarded by the papacy as a \"good\" Catholic, and the papacy gets the final word on that in the RC church.\n \n \nThere are those who worship in churches and fully accept and love gay people. I've given you links to some of the gay friendly churches. One link offers contacts around the globe, another in the US. There were HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HITS on googling \"gay friendly churches\".\n\n \n Indeed there are. I am aware of who the gay-friendly churches are, and I've mentioned here before.

Your mind is made up and no facts are going to change it.\n\n \n As I said, I am aware of organisations and churches that regard themselves as both Christian and gay. I am also aware they are not accepted by the mass of Christianity as being in communion with them. So who do you suggest I regard as \"True Christians\", and why? Who holds the flame for True Christianity, and how do you decide?\n \n \nBeing one who does not beleive in the inerrancy of the Bible, I can say that even if I found such scriptual backing, I would not base my belief in it on the fact that it appeared in the Bible. I don't think you'll find Jesus condemning homosexuality in the Bible either.\n\n \n Well, good for you -- you are a bad Christian, according to many who profess to be Christians. Look, you can always hold up exceptions to any rule. Yes, there are lots of Christians who have no problem with being gay, or with those who are gay. I don't need to read your links to understand that. My point is they are vastly outnumbered in their religion by those who do have such problems.\n \n If Christian homophobia were just a minority expression of Christianity, then you would be right to accuse me of an unfair slander, but the reality is it isn't unfair. When I open the barrel of Christianity, I do find a few good apples, but most are rotten. The fattest apple of all, Catholicism, is rotten to the core.\n \n I won't dispute that you have a point that Christians deserve to be judged as individuals.

   "Then why is Matthew so worried that 611,000 signatures were raised in Florida to get a vote on Gay Marriage there placed on the ballot. It takes a 60% majority in favor of the bill to kill Gay Marriage in Florida nad Matthew is rightly concerned.\n\n \n This pretty much matches what I said the stats were. And I don't think Matthew is worried - I suspect he is disgusted and angry. \n \n So am I.\n \n \nWhat you fail to realize is that the very loud pro-gay movement is much smaller than they appear to be in reality. They distort Polls, surveys and any public opinion results that they create in order to make it sound like all Americans except for a bigoted few support them. \n\n \n Kinda like you distort your posts to imply that everyone who shares your sexual orientation is one you can speak for?\n \n \nLove is your term. It is used so interchangeably today it no longer has any meaning. What you call love is obviously some perversion of my definition of the word.\n\n \n I want nothing to do with your definition. Its elitist, full of hateful conditions and insulting. I don't love like that. My love doesn't come with strings attached.\n \n \nOh really? And you base that on what! Care to post a verse or passage where God said He is no longer involved in the lives of Nations? Or is actively involved in overseeing this World? And as for Christ being the only way to God, that is true on a personal level but God deals with Nations on a completely different level than He deals personally with His children.\n\n \n Its common sense! Why bother with Christ if all you had to do was join the right nation? And I know the Bible says that people can ONLY find God through Christ. That is the only way. Your address is irrelevant. Its not like the Canadians are doomed. You won't save yourself, Matthew or America by preventing gay marriage. God isn't interested in empty action. Forcing a non-believer to follow the rules of your faith is just that - empty action. You are meddling in the private lives of others for sole purpose of appeasing your religious sensibilities. Self-gratification once again. It doesn't serve God - it serves YOU.\n \n \nExcellent, you get a gold star. And so will America still be on some cultural level when it falls and is utterly destroyed by our enemies. And God will allow it to happen rather than intervene to protect us because people who believe as YOU do will finally become the majority. So congratulations jito, you will eventually win this battle for the morality of the American soul to the total destruction of your own peace, security and ultimately your freedom and your life.\n\n \n Rome fell because of corruption, greed, other world powers, and the effort required to sustain an empire that was beyond huge. Quit passing the buck to God. \n \n And I am sorry, but government pandering to your religion does not make anyone free. It is not freedom to be what you think people ought to be. They should be exactly who they are - and it is not your place to tell them who to love, how to live their lives, or how to build their families.",

Add the Boy Scouts of America.\n \n There are plenty of Christian institutions who revile gay people.\nName them with links if you want me to read about them.\n \n \n \n\n An \"apologist\" does not apologise for anyone one: he defends a position. \nI'm not defending their position.\n \n \n \nYou cannot attack my \"indictment\" of all Christians, because I haven't made one. I do indict the majority of Christian churches, who represent and lead the majority of Christians. Yes, every now and then, one meets a just Christian. It just doesn't happen as often as Christian like to imagine.\nYou simply ignore the fact that all Christians do not all think like the Pope. You have no idea how many think either way. You just rant against all Christians because it suits you to do so. It fits your argument and makes you a pitiful victim.\n \n \n\n Then I am puzzled why you regard yourself as a Christian.\nQuite simple. I accept Jesus as Lord and Savior. That's all it takes, bro.\n \n \n \n\n Well, Herr Ratzinger certainly thinks there aren't. If we are gay and accept ourselves, we are automatically excommunicated by virtue of our refusal to renounce our alleged \"sin\". But yes, there are plenty of gay people who regard themselves as Catholic. (I am not one.) However, it's questionable whether anyone who does not accept papal authority absolutely and unquestionably would be regarded by the papacy as a \"good\" Catholic, and the papacy gets the final word on that in the RC church.\nThe Papacy is much like the Bible...full of the vanity of man. There's NOTHING Godly about the Pope, the Cardinals, the Bishops, the Priests, the alter boys...all these people are just sinning humans, just like you and me.\n \n \n \n\n Indeed there are. I am aware of who the gay-friendly churches are, and I've mentioned here before. But there are MILLIONS who condemn gays on the authority of their pastors.\nHave you tried communicating with some of the friendly churches? (I guessing, \"hell no!\")\n \n \n \n\n As I said, I am aware of organisations and churches that regard themselves as both Christian and gay. I am also aware they are not accepted by the mass of Christianity as being in communion with them. So who do you suggest I regard as \"True Christians\", and why? Who holds the flame for True Christianity, and how do you decide?\nYou've convinced yourself it's the vast majority that hate you, yet you have no idea how many accept you as you are.\n \n \n \n\n Well, good for you -- you are a bad Christian, according to many who profess to be Christians. Look, you can always hold up exceptions to any rule. Yes, there are lots of Christians who have no problem with being gay, or with those who are gay. I don't need to read your links to understand that. My point is they are vastly outnumbered in their religion by those who do have such problems.\nProve your numbers guessing.\n \n \n \n\n If Christian homophobia were just a minority expression of Christianity, then you would be right to accuse me of an unfair slander, but the reality is it isn't unfair. When I open the barrel of Christianity, I do find a few good apples, but most are rotten. The fattest apple of all, Catholicism, is rotten to the core.\nYou haven't looked at the quiet ones. The only people you see are the ones that make a lot of noise.\n \n \n \n\n I won't dispute that you have a point that Christians deserve to be judged as individuals. \n Then stop generalizing about how Christians feel about you. \nHowever, individuals do not operate in a vacuum. They are moulded in part by the community they belong to.\nThere is a bell shaped curve everywhere you look. I think you'd really be surprised at how many people talk about how inflexible, unfair and often mistaken their own pastors are.\n \n Find a church that accepts gays and listen to what they have to say. That's your homework assignment for the weekend.",

   "Why shouldn't I be able to?\n\n \n Simply not acting on one's innate desire/makeup, does not make those innate desires/makeup go away. They define who the person is. To my mind (and I know it is debatable), your sexuality is as innate as your eye color or handedness. You have no more control over it than you have control over who your parents are. I guess if having blue eyes or being left handed was immoral, one could choose not to use his eyes or left hand so as to avoid sinning, but it doesn't change their physical make up.\n \n If you \"hate\" or believe part of someone's innate nature is immoral, then logically it would follow that you \"hate\" that person regardless of whether they actually act out that nature or not, because that nature is an integral part of them, they can't alter it. (I know hate is likely too strong a word for most.)\n \n I've been contemplating analogies to this to see if I can understand the justification. The best example I can come up with that would support your point of view would be murder. If a person has murderous thoughts (not just passing rage, but psychopathic thoughts, for whatever reason serial killers have them?), but never acts on them, I suppose I could see your point. The person hasn't done anything wrong, even though they have a desire to kill.\n \n The problem is that you have to believe the psychopatic behaviour is innate, and you have to equate murder with homosexual sex. The first one is possible, but a stretch, the second is a huge stretch.\n \n The other issue is that according to my recollection of Bible teaching, \"impure thoughts\" were every bit the sin as the actual action. In that case, it's impossible for an innate nature such as homosexuality to be accepted, or not deemed a sin, regardless of whether or not one acts on the desire.\n \n Waxy",

Homosexuality is like left-handedness, eh? Guess they'd better drop all the pride events, the parades, the push for legislation, the endless shotgun-tactic rhetoric against religion, as well as pull all the efforts to have a small percentage given the same attention as everyone else in school textbooks and so forth. Oh and, while they're at it, they'd need to stop belittling and being hateful towards people who try to live opposite of their sexuality by being \"ex-gay\", because, after all, a leftie certainly can learn to write just fine with their right hand.

Also, civil rights are rarely freely granted: they always have to be fought for. There is plenty in history that proves that, and we can analogise the gay rights movement to Gandhi, MLK and the Suffragettes. Why should we wait until the gay-bashing Christianists finally see the light?\n \n Oh, and BTW, there is also an analogy between left-handers who are forced against their natures to write with their right hands, and ex-gays who are forced against their natures by religious pressure to pretend they are straight, or to think that being straight is morally superior to being gay. Both incur a considerable physical and psychological cost that is totally unnecessary for them to bear.\n \n Better by far to leave both well enough alone. \n \n So you see, Josh ole buddy, your analogy is one that just keeps on giving! :)\n \n P.S.

   "I think that those conservative Christians who believe \"homosexuality is a sin\" have gotten themselves into a box with their arguments. If \"homosexuality is a sin,\" then what does that mean for gay people, and how should Christians treat gay people? I've heard plenty of Christians say, \"I treat gay people with respect and dignity. I don't hate them as people or oppose them as people. It's the 'sin' of 'homosexual behavior' that I hate.\" \n \n But this argument only tangles them up more. What, exactly, is \"homosexal behavior?\" They mean, of course, sex between two people of the same sex. Often folks will say, \"This is fornication, and it is clearly a sin because the Bible says it is. Only sex within marriage is acceptable to God, and marriage only exists between a man and a woman.\" \n \n Of course, this argument raises the problem that the Bible never says anything about marriage between people of the same sex being unacceptable to God. The Bible is silent on the question of same-sex marriage. It is simply a leap of interpretation for Christians to claim that God condemns same-sex marriage. It is based on the absence of scripture and people's interpretation of silence. Does God condemn computers, since they are not mentioned in the Bible? Does God condemn cars, since they are not mentioned in the Bible? \n And if same-sex marriage is never mentioned in the Bible, and if gay people are getting married, which they are, then how can Christians claim that their relationships are \"fornication\" or are unacceptable to God? \n \n But back to the problem of what to do about gay people. If some Christians believe that \"homosexuality is a sin,\" then how, in their view, does God expect gay people to live our lives? I have been asking a variety of conservative Christians this question. \n \n One answer I have heard is that there are no gay people, and the idea that God created some people gay is a myth. Folks who assert this position argue that \"homosexuality\" is simply a temptation that some people fall into, like alcoholism or drug addiction. They reject the idea that there are gay people at all. They argue for a sort of religious treatment model for \"homosexuality.\" Folks who believe this often argue for the efficacy of \"ex-gay ministries\" or for various forms of \"reparative therapy.\" They are most enthusiastic about claiming that God can \"heal\" people of \"homosexuality\" and lead people away from this \"temptation\" and this \"sin.\" Some of these folks emphasize that \"homosexality\" is a \"choice,\" while others see it more as a temptation that people struggle with, or a problem somewhat like a medical problem that people can overcome by embracing Jesus. \n \n Another conservative Christian position I have heard accepts the idea that gay people exist, but insists that gay people must be celibate for life. This position seems to be more in line with current Catholic doctrine. These folks assert that there is nothing wrong with being gay, so long as gay people do not act on their sexual orientation. When pressed about how they can argue that some people must remain celibate for life, they will say that God sets up obstacles for all people, and the way is always hard. For gay people, God has set up the challenge, and the opportunity, to serve him by being celibate. They say that gay people should rejoice in celibacy as a way of serving God. \n \n Neither of these two broad positions is acceptable to most gay people, of course, because they both insist that we deny who we are and not live full lives. The second position is at least more consistent with what we know about sexual orientation. It rests on the acceptance that some people simply are gay and are not going to become heterosexual. It's not a fair position, because it demands that gay people give up relationships and marriage simply because of some people's interpretation of a few less-than-clear passages in the Bible. \n \n The first broad position, embraced more by conservative evangelical Protestants, I think, is very shaky. It rests on assumptions about sexual orientation that are not consistent with what current psychologists, physicians, researchers, and gay people ourselves say about who we are. The first broad position is a house built on sand. And the more failures we see with so-called \"ex-gay ministries,\" the more obvious becomes the fallacy of this position. And, from what I have seen, the more insistent become the people who adhere to it that they are right.",

We had a lesbian couple come to our Christmas Pageant and they were received warmly and with love and gentleness. Nobody jumped on them to discuss their sex lives at all. And YES, they were invited back.\n \n \nBut this argument only tangles them up more. What, exactly, is \"homosexal behavior?\" They mean, of course, sex between two people of the same sex. Often folks will say, \"This is fornication, and it is clearly a sin because the Bible says it is.

How do we say that ok, gay sex is wrong, but if we then marry then gay sex becomes right? Of course that isn't even a rational deduction. If a married person has a mistress on the side, can he then marry the mistress while still married to his wife to make that adultery right ?

When pressed about how they can argue that some people must remain celibate for life, they will say that God sets up obstacles for all people, and the way is always hard. For gay people, God has set up the challenge, and the opportunity, to serve him by being celibate. They say that gay people should rejoice in celibacy as a way of serving God.\n \n of these two broad positions is acceptable to most gay people, of course, because they both insist that we deny who we are and not live full lives. The second position is at least more consistent with what we know about sexual orientation. It rests on the acceptance that some people simply are gay and are not going to become heterosexual. It's not a fair position, because it demands that gay people give up relationships and marriage simply because of some people's interpretation of a few less-than-clear passages in the Bible.\n \n first broad position, embraced more by conservative evangelical Protestants, I think, is very shaky. It rests on assumptions about sexual orientation that are not consistent with what current psychologists, physicians, researchers, and gay people ourselves say about who we are. The first broad position is a house built on sand. And the more failures we see with so-called \"ex-gay ministries,\" the more obvious becomes the fallacy of this position. And, from what I have seen, the more insistent become the people who adhere to it that they are right.\n\n \n These are tough questions and I don't claim to have all the answers. All I know is that as believers we deal with gays with loving acceptance without judging what they do in private while not endorsing gay sex in any way. When the subject comes up, we will treat it just like sins of the flesh that straight people commit. But just as with straight people, we don't go spying into peoples bedrooms asking them what activities are taking place.\n \n I am very happy to simply lead them to Jesus saving grace, know that they possess the Holy Spirit of God and then leave them in His care to guide and lead them as new children of grace. \n \n You see, here is the issue that has never happened to us but would be difficult to handle if it did happen. If a man was accused by his wife of committing adultery, and he repented, he would be restored to the body. If he insisted that what he was doing was ok, he would be de-fellowshiped and no longer welcomed as a member of the church as the church cannot condone overt disobedience to God. \n \n The same would apply for a gay person or couple. We would welcome them in fellowship, but if they wore for example, Tee Shirts that said Gay Sex Rocks or made out with each other in church, or basically flaunted the sexual aspects of the lifestyle, that would cause problems that couldn't be ignored.\n \n In other words, we would ignore the obvious sexual relationship that we know is PROBABLY going on behind closed doors for gays, just as we know that within the church there are some people who are cheating on their spouses and committing sexual sins against God. It isn't the Churches responsibility to investigate and out the private sins of its members, but only to deal with public sins that are exposed to the light of day within the body of Christ. \n \n What should be important to gays about the church they attend should be that the church accepts and teaches that all people, no matter who they are can be saved. Any church that say's that gay people are unredeemable and automatically damned is a heretical church which should obviously be avoided as they don't know the bible or the grace of God, and that Jesus died for ALL of our sins, not just some of them. That is why I argue so strongly that like adultery and fornication, God condemns homosexuality, but not homosexuals.",

Now to start, what is this about God condemning red heads and left handed people? What kind of a lie is this?

The Israelites sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab.\n Jdg 20:16 Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred chosen men who were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.\n 1Ch 12:2 they were armed with bows and were able to shoot arrows or to sling stones right-handed or left-handed; they were kinsmen of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin):\n Do these verses show a hatred by God for left handed people?

Is it also possible that religious beliefs can cause harm to people? Yes, sometimes these do, and sometimes religion is wrong too. However, if a gay person does feel happy being celibate that's fine. Such people would be defined as asexual or loners and may also be gay or straight.

   "Well, you have a tall order ahead, because it's not \"conservative Christians\" in general you need to convince, but many Christian gays themselves. They're just doing what they feel God wants them to do, and it's up to them to do whatever they want. No one holds a gun to their head. They're making their own choice in this. You're delving into some deeply personal religious issues that varies from individual to individual. Christians believe that what God has called a person to do, He will give them the strength to do it.\n\n \n It isn't helpful to support them in their addiction to religion, though. One should be sympathetic and understanding, but not act as an enabler. The trouble is, there is no such creature as a genuine ex-gay. They are generally people who have been taught either to sublime their sexuality into other activities, or otherwise to reject their own natures. That form of self-flagellation can't be a good thing in principle.\n \n When someone tortures themselves, physically or mentally, for the sake of a religious fantasy, that person needs help, not praise. They are psychologically disturbed.",

   "You must lie and pervert the truth in order to defend your stance lesz.\n\n \n I leave lying to Christians, Archie. Their churches have had 2000 years of practice.\n \n \nNow to start, what is this about God condemning red heads and left handed people? What kind of a lie is this? Here are three verses about being left handed, but I couldn't even find a passage about red heads at all.\n\n \n Historically, Christians. among other faiths, have condemned left-handedness. That's as silly as condemning homosexuality. The fact is that Christians are skilled at reading the bible as condemning whatever it is they have set their hearts on condemning. It's very convenient to have a scripture that can be interpreted to reflect all one's dearest prejudices.\n \n \nMost Christian Churches believe exactly as I described in the post above and if you will call any full gospel, non-denominational, conservative, or so called fundamentalist church on the phone, get a pastor on the line and read my post to them, and ask them if they agree with it as an example of how they deal with sin in general and homosexuality specifically, 98% or more will agree with it. So rather than speak from ignorance and condemn without cause, test what I say and learn the truth of what real believers believe and practice in reality.\n\n \n I agree most Christian churches are like that, which is why I reject them unreservedly. I don't believe in hatred as a way of life, but they do. You see, Archie, I think you are more representative of Christianity as it is for most people than some of the other regular Christian apologists here. They take more sophisticated views of religion than yours, but they are a minority within the set of faiths and cults that call themselves Christian.\n \n BTW, I never read your biblical passages, no matter how many colours of the rainbow you dress them up in. A lie is still a lie no matter how prettily presented, and I don't need a bible to tell me that truth. I reject your religion not merely because of its odious teachings about gay human beings. I reject it because it is wrong to the core.",

   "That's interesting to hear, given that others have said there may be far more \"in the closet\" gays than not. And if they are in the closet you cannot possibly know what they're doing with their lives in terms of whether they choose to have sex or not. Incidentally, I find it fascinating that you see this in terms of choosing to \"remain celibate\" rather than choosing to have sex. The default in your thinking, seems to be to have sex (and therefore the ulterior choice from the default is to be celibate). It's not necessarily that way for Christians, which is why I don't think you really see the situation in the way Christians do. While you understand gay people--certainly better than I--since you are one, I don't think you really understand Christian people, necessarily. And it's not just gay people we're talking about here, but Christian gay people. There's a whole other side to this going on that you aren't privy to, and that's their relationship between them and their God, because it is a deeply personal matter. Among Christian gays, I suspect choosing to not have gay sex (what you refer to as \"celibacy\") is more common than you may think.\n \n \n \n Not necessarily. It's probably where you might find most of what you would call \"out\" gay Christians. But not necessarily most gay Christians.\n \n \n \n Well I think it goes without saying that people can't generally change their orientation, if at all. As far as I'm concerned that's not really what the issue here is, and it's not something I care to debate about. (Nevertheless, if someone felt God wanted them to try and do so, that's their business, and is between them and God.) The issue is more simply about the way some people choose to live their lives. I'm sure you understand this, but if people are going to have a gay pride movement, and choose to live \"out\", they in turn need to accept that not all gays want to live that way, nor do all gays agree with their moralistic view over homosexual behavior. An analogy of this is the feminist movement. I think feminists have had to go through a process in the past decades of realising that not all women want to be \"empowered\". For some, \"empowerment\" means living in a traditional role, because that's what they want to do. But I get the impression sometimes that people in your movement think every gay person should be out and abandon traditional religious views about homosexual behavior. What you don't understand (I think) is that in doing so, you're essentially asking them to turn their back on their relationship with God (because that's what they believe), and not everyone wants to do that, naturally. Their religion trumps their sexuality. There are probably many, many gays who choose to live differently than your movement would prescribe for their lives, and religion is there to help them do that in whatever way it possibly can. No, the process isn't perfect. Sometimes it's messy. Sometimes there is misunderstanding. But I think people are doing the best they can, in most cases. The one thing I think shouldn't be expected is for people to turn their backs on their religion. And as long as that's the case, you're going to have religious gays who don't live \"out\" and instead live against what may feel more natural for them. And you're going to have religion supporting them. Perhaps if your movement supported them more (the way THEY want to live their lives, as 'conservative religious' people--rather than the way your movement wants them to) you wouldn't have to see religion and it's programs filling that role as much.\n\n \n I would never tell any gay person to turn his or her back on their religion. It is the conservative Christian churches that put gay people in an impossible position, by telling gay people that we cannot be ourselves and be Christian and be saved. I have recently been in lengthy discussions of this topic with conservative Christians and with liberal Christians, and the conservative Christians really do take either of the two broad positions I described in my earlier post. They either demand that gay people change their sexual orientation, that they \"repent\" of the \"sin\" of homosexuality and try to become heterosexual, or that the gay people choose lifelong celibacy. This is what conservative Christians told me in lengthy discussions over the past 5 months on this topic. I have heard many conservative Christians say that there is no such thing as a gay Christian, that you cannot be gay and be a Christian. To be Christians, they say, people have to \"repent\" and pledge to engage no more in the \"sin\" of homosexuality. Some insisted that gay people must turn to Christ to try to become heterosexual because, they argued, God intends for everyone to marry a person of the opposite sex and procreate. When people pointed out to them that not everyone is able to become a biological parent, some of these folks insisted that it's not true, that even elderly women past childbearing age can pray and God can allow them to conceive. I was, frankly, surprised by this argument, which took the \"with God all things are possible\" argument to a weird extreme. \n \n I do not understand from reading your post how you think conservative gay Christians are supposedly able to live as conservative Christians without suppressing who they are. You seem to be suggesting that gay people can be conservative Christians just fine if they stay in the closet. But that's not fine with the conservative Christians I talked with, and I discussed this with many. They would argue that being closeted about one's same-sex relationships is still sinning. Pretending not to sin does not make the sin go away. They would argue that people who hide their same-sex relationships in order to be accepted in the churches are going to hell just as surely as are people who are open about their same-sex relationships.\n \n If a conservative Christian really believes in the doctrine of the conservative Christian churches, then he or she cannot in good conscience live as a closeted gay person. That would be \"sinning,\" according to the doctrine of these churches. A person who believes in this doctrine would find life as a closeted gay person to be unacceptable, unless, of course, the person was entirely celibate. In my discussions with conservative Christians, I met a couple of celibate gay people who had chosen celibacy because they believe that \"homosexuality\" is a \"sin.\" They were struggling with celibacy, and they admitted this. They were not finding this an easy path. I do not fault them for choosing this path, if that is what they want. But they said that it is a great struggle for them. \n \n The issue here is not being closeted or not. The issue is the fact that conservative Christian churches make it impossible for gay people to live their lives as full human beings and be conservative Christians. Are there closeted gay people living as conservative Christians? Yes, surely. But living in the closet is a terrible way to live. I used to be in the closet so I would not lose my job, and it was terrible. It took a great emotional toll on me. It was not a \"choice\" on my part. It was something I felt forced into doing. And to live in the closet contrary to one's religious beliefs, in order to be accepted by one's church, seems like living what amounts to a lie. If people choose to do this, that's up to them. It's the conservative Christian churches that would drive the closeted gay people out if they discovered the lie. Gay people are not telling other gay people that they must leave the conservative Christian churches. It's the conservative Christians that are doing that. \n \n There is, of course, an alternative for gay people who do not want to live a lie within conservative Christianity or to struggle with lifelong celibacy or with futile efforts to somehow become heterosexual. That alternative is to find an accepting Christian church, a Christian church that accepts gay people as we are and does not demand either lifelong celibacy or \"repentance\" from the alleged \"sin\" of being who we are. There are plenty of gay Christians in churches that accept gay people. Gay Christians do not have to stay in conservative churches that effectively reject them by making life as a gay Christian impossible for them. They can join churches that affirm who they are, and they don't have to give up their faith.",

I agree with some of what you write here, and I disagree with some of it. I agree that people should speak up for rational thinking and present ideas and evidence contradict some people's religious beliefs. I do it all the time. I say that I do not believe in a virgin birth, or in a literal resurrection. I say that I do not believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, or that the Bible was inspired by God. I say that I do not believe that Jesus was any more divine than anyone else. I say that I see no credible evidence to support these particular, common Christian beliefs. I believe we should express our views that challenge people's religious beliefs. My purpose in doing this is not to shake anyone else's faith, but to present what I think and my perception of the world, which is different from that of most (but not all) Christians. I am not afraid to express my views or to say what I think of people's beliefs, and I find many commonly held Christian beliefs to be, frankly, absurd and nonsensical. I respect people's right to hold what I regard as absurd and nonsensical beliefs, but I am not going to be silent about what I think. I try to be respectful, of course, except when people's beliefs promote prejudice and discrimination. I see no reason to be respectful of prejudice, which does clear harm to other people.\n \n Where I disagree with you is in the notion that Christianity is just one thing, and that one thing is a whole that falls apart when any of its tenets are challenged. There are many different Christian viewpoints, ranging from the most rigid Protestant fundamentalism and the most hateful beliefs of Fred Phelps to the most latitudinarian and challenging ideas of Bishop Spong. Christian encompass a wide range of beliefs, and to assume that Christianity requires adherence to the Bible, or adherence to any particular interpretation of the Bible, is to allow certain groups of Christians to dictate what the faith is. It's to exclude from the the faith all those dissenters who have been labeled heretics, because they disagreed and still disagree with what some have claimed to be Christian orthodoxy.\n \n There were followers of Jesus before the Council of Nicea. There were followers of Jesus before a group of men chose what to include in the canon and what to exclude. There were and are followers of Jesus who do not hold the Bible to be the word of God and who do not practice Biblical idolatry. And among Christians, of course, there have long been different ways of interpreting and understanding the will of God and the meaning of the life of Jesus. Bishop Spong does not believe in a literal physical resurrection. He is regarded as a heretic by many Christians, but he regards himself as a passionate Christian. \n \n I think that surrendering prejudice against gay people would be a dramatic change for many Christians, and not such a dramatic change for many other Christians. It would be no more dramatic than the surrender of prejudice against women or the surrender of prejudice against African Americans, which many, possibly most, Christians have achieved to one degree or another, with some exceptions of course. I agree with you that some religious beliefs, possibly many religious beliefs, are incompatible with living in a just and free society. But should we ask people to discard religion entirely because of those specific beliefs, or should we ask people to discard those particular beliefs? In the time of the abolition movement, most American Christians either believed in slavery or accepted slavery without protest. Then a movement emerged, mostly among evangelical Christians like Garrison and Phillips and the Tappan brothers, to challenge the Christian support for slavery. They waged an intense battle that divided the churches, a battle that led eventually to the Civil War. Did those abolitionist Christians set out to destroy Christianity? No....they set out to change it, to make Christianity a positive force for human rights, not a force that supported slavery. And they won. Christianity survived, and it became better because of those Christian abolitionists. This change did not distort Christianity out of all recognition. It perhaps made Christianity less Biblical, as the Bible pretty obviously supports slavery and nowhere explicitly condemns it. I think nearly all Christians today would say that this was a positive change for their faith tradition. \n \n I disagree with you that the Christian faith structure as an entirety is an obstacle to human rights. Christianity has been the impetus to a variety of human rights movements, and it continues to be so. We hear more about right-wing Christian movements today, like the anti-abortion movement, which conservative Christians tend to view as a human rights movement. Suppporters of a woman's right to choose tend to regard the anti-abortion movement as anti-human rights. There is a fundamental disagreement within Christianity and outside it about the nature of that particular movement. There are other movements, however, that get less media attention but which are clearly human rights movements. One of these is the movement to abolish the death penalty, what supporters today call the modern abolition movement. This movement draws people of faith from a range of traditions, including Roman Catholicism. There is also anti-war activism among Christians, motivated by a belief in the teachings of Jesus. The African American civil rights movement was sparked to a great extent by Christian teachings, melded with teachings from other religious faiths and non-religious beliefs. \n \n You ask whether charity and goodness spring from religion or simply from an innate human propensity for charity. I think that both religious faith and charity may spring from common innate human desires. Will people be charitable without religion? Sure. People who are non-religious are often very charitable and are often deeply involved in human rights movements. But most people of faith are not going to abandon religion anytime soon, no matter how much some people may wish them or encourage them to do so. Religious faith is no less an innate human impulse than charity is.\n \n My argument to you is that religious faith does not necessarily mean believing in the irrational. To me, faith is not a doctrine; it's a practice. I do not believe in any particular theology. If asked about salvation, I say I don't know, and I don't concern myself with this question. If asked about the Bible, I say that I see no evidence that the Bible is the word of God, and I do not adhere to it. If asked whether I go to church, I say yes, I do every Sunday and even more often that that. My church, a UU congregation, is my family's community. We meet our friends in church, we have fellowship together in church, we work for social justice together in church, and we discuss our different beliefs and faith practices in church. We do not adhere to any theological doctrine. I realize that this is unusual, and it's not the practice of most Christian churches, which do insist on adherence to a doctrine. However, religious faith does not require a belief in a doctrine, nor do all Christian churches share a common doctrine. \n \n I think that for some people, the impulse to work for human rights and social justice is closely entwined with their faith.

It can also be a negative force, and when it is, I think we need to challenge that negative activism and speak an alternate truth to power, to borrow Quaker language.",

   "Interesting post. I agree with some of what you write here, and I disagree with some of it.\n\n \n Of course.\n \n \nI agree that people should speak up for rational thinking and present ideas and evidence contradict some people's religious beliefs. I do it all the time. I say that I do not believe in a virgin birth, or in a literal resurrection. I say that I do not believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, or that the Bible was inspired by God. I say that I do not believe that Jesus was any more divine than anyone else. I say that I see no credible evidence to support these particular, common Christian beliefs. I believe we should express our views that challenge people's religious beliefs. My purpose in doing this is not to shake anyone else's faith, but to present what I think and my perception of the world, which is different from that of most (but not all) Christians. I am not afraid to express my views or to say what I think of people's beliefs, and I find many commonly held Christian beliefs to be, frankly, absurd and nonsensical. I respect people's right to hold what I regard as absurd and nonsensical beliefs, but I am not going to be silent about what I think. I try to be respectful, of course, except when people's beliefs promote prejudice and discrimination. I see no reason to be respectful of prejudice, which does clear harm to other people.\n\n \n I largely agree with this, but there are a couple of points. I do want to shake people's faith. I think that's a good goal in itself. I value skepticism over faith. (Not that I think faith is worthless, but I value skepticism more.) Second, I don't fully subscribe to the notion one should be unconditionally respectful of other people's beliefs. That applies in therapy, or in cases where one is trying to obtain an understanding of a belief. I am engaged in advocacy, however. I do not believe that all beliefs are equal, nor do I believe we should respect them equally.\n \n \nWhere I disagree with you is in the notion that Christianity is just one thing, and that one thing is a whole that falls apart when any of its tenets are challenged. There are many different Christian viewpoints, ranging from the most rigid Protestant fundamentalism and the most hateful beliefs of Fred Phelps to the most latitudinarian and challenging ideas of Bishop Spong. Christian encompass a wide range of beliefs, and to assume that Christianity requires adherence to the Bible, or adherence to any particular interpretation of the Bible, is to allow certain groups of Christians to dictate what the faith is. It's to exclude from the the faith all those dissenters who have been labeled heretics, because they disagreed and still disagree with what some have claimed to be Christian orthodoxy.\n\n \n Well, I won't dispute that \"Christianity\" is an umbrella concept that shelters a fair number of diverse notions. Still, I think it is possible to talk sensibly about a consensus of Christian beliefs, core Christian beliefs, Christian fundamentals, and beliefs held by a majority of Christians.\n \n Now, maybe there is some eternal Platonic ideal or Aristotelian essence of Christianity that stands independent of individual believers, but I'm not fond of that idea. Christianity in my view is whatever Christians make of it. I want to judge the tree by its fruits.\n \n \nThere were followers of Jesus before the Council of Nicea. There were followers of Jesus before a group of men chose what to include in the canon and what to exclude. There were and are followers of Jesus who do not hold the Bible to be the word of God and who do not practice Biblical idolatry. And among Christians, of course, there have long been different ways of interpreting and understanding the will of God and the meaning of the life of Jesus. Bishop Spong does not believe in a literal physical resurrection. He is regarded as a heretic by many Christians, but he regards himself as a passionate Christian.\n \n \n I don't dispute there are many interpretations of Christianity. I've even come across Christians who do not believe in the deity of Christ. However, I have to deal with the prevalent and politically powerful ones. Christianity is what Christians do, in my view, which is why I view Archie as a quintessential Christian.\n \n \nI think that surrendering prejudice against gay people would be a dramatic change for many Christians, and not such a dramatic change for many other Christians. It would be no more dramatic than the surrender of prejudice against women or the surrender of prejudice against African Americans, which many, possibly most, Christians have achieved to one degree or another, with some exceptions of course. I agree with you that some religious beliefs, possibly many religious beliefs, are incompatible with living in a just and free society. But should we ask people to discard religion entirely because of those specific beliefs, or should we ask people to discard those particular beliefs? In the time of the abolition movement, most American Christians either believed in slavery or accepted slavery without protest. Then a movement emerged, mostly among evangelical Christians like Garrison and Phillips and the Tappan brothers, to challenge the Christian support for slavery. They waged an intense battle that divided the churches, a battle that led eventually to the Civil War. Did those abolitionist Christians set out to destroy Christianity? No....they set out to change it, to make Christianity a positive force for human rights, not a force that supported slavery. And they won. Christianity survived, and it became better because of those Christian abolitionists. This change did not distort Christianity out of all recognition. It perhaps made Christianity less Biblical, as the Bible pretty obviously supports slavery and nowhere explicitly condemns it. I think nearly all Christians today would say that this was a positive change for their faith tradition.\n \n \n Yes, I think we should. F'rinstance, to what extent is it possible to divorce a religious system from the beliefs of its adherents? Fine, maybe it's impossible to talk of a monolithic Christian essence, owing to irreconcilable differences among people who call themselves Christians. Some use Christianity to support slavery or homophobia, others to oppose them. I'd argue that the Christianity of today is radically different from what it was in the days of slavery, and any post-homophobia Christianity will be radically different from what it is today.\n \n Maybe we shouldn't even call them all \"Christianity\".\n \n \nI disagree with you that the Christian faith structure as an entirety is an obstacle to human rights. Christianity has been the impetus to a variety of human rights movements, and it continues to be so. We hear more about right-wing Christian movements today, like the anti-abortion movement, which conservative Christians tend to view as a human rights movement. Suppporters of a woman's right to choose tend to regard the anti-abortion movement as anti-human rights. There is a fundamental disagreement within Christianity and outside it about the nature of that particular movement. There are other movements, however, that get less media attention but which are clearly human rights movements. One of these is the movement to abolish the death penalty, what supporters today call the modern abolition movement. This movement draws people of faith from a range of traditions, including Roman Catholicism. There is also anti-war activism among Christians, motivated by a belief in the teachings of Jesus. The African American civil rights movement was sparked to a great extent by Christian teachings, melded with teachings from other religious faiths and non-religious beliefs. \n\n \n My issue with Christianity in its entirety is that it is a revelatory religion. It is not a religion based on reason, but on scripture. So you like some of the modern Christian interpretations of scripture based on the relatively recent rejection of slavery, but dislike others based on its acceptance of homophobia. But these interpretations are all scripturally based. There is nothing to say that interpretations couldn't swing back towards acceptance of slavery.\n \n This is an irremediable defect in Christianity, in my view. It is pointless and irrational to try and divine the \"intentions\" of a Creator through scripture. It's a project completely doomed to failure, with a lot of suffering as a by-product. That is why I reject Christianity as a whole. It's an appallingly bad epistemological model. It doesn't matter that some versions of Christianity are more attractive or less repellent than others, the difficulty is they are all built on the same flimsy foundations.\n \n \nYou ask whether charity and goodness spring from religion or simply from an innate human propensity for charity. I think that both religious faith and charity may spring from common innate human desires. Will people be charitable without religion? Sure. People who are non-religious are often very charitable and are often deeply involved in human rights movements. But most people of faith are not going to abandon religion anytime soon, no matter how much some people may wish them or encourage them to do so. Religious faith is no less an innate human impulse than charity is.\n\n \n I think I agree with most of this. I think there is a numinous instinct, but I do not agree it has to manifest itself through theistic religion. I think there are better ways of channeling it.\n \n \nMy argument to you is that religious faith does not necessarily mean believing in the irrational. To me, faith is not a doctrine; it's a practice. I do not believe in any particular theology. If asked about salvation, I say I don't know, and I don't concern myself with this question. If asked about the Bible, I say that I see no evidence that the Bible is the word of God, and I do not adhere to it. If asked whether I go to church, I say yes, I do every Sunday and even more often that that. My church, a UU congregation, is my family's community. We meet our friends in church, we have fellowship together in church, we work for social justice together in church, and we discuss our different beliefs and faith practices in church. We do not adhere to any theological doctrine. I realize that this is unusual, and it's not the practice of most Christian churches, which do insist on adherence to a doctrine. However, religious faith does not require a belief in a doctrine, nor do all Christian churches share a common doctrine.\n \n \n Well, my argument is not primarily with your faith; it's with the faith of the majority. There are very few members of any Christian church who would recognise you as a fellow Christian, for all your admiration of the teachings of Jesus. And I do not admire all of Jesus' teachings. \n \n I can respect churches as communities that provide fellowship. I recognise that raw atheism cannot do that. However, I have to contend with churches that want to go beyond providing fellowship to enforcing \"god's law\".\n \n \nI think that for some people, the impulse to work for human rights and social justice is closely entwined with their faith. Their faith provides them with a vision of all humanity as connected. Their faith also provides them with a base for organizing people for social justice projects. I think that religious faith can be a positive force for human rights, as it has been on numerous occasions in our history. It can also be a negative force, and when it is, I think we need to challenge that negative activism and speak an alternate truth to power, to borrow Quaker language.\n\n \n Well, I wish you luck. I am not at all sure that the positive aspects can be divorced from the negative ones. I think we may need a better model for fellowship than religion has historically been able to provide. \n \n My own prejudice is that the fly in the ointment is monotheism, the patriarchal god. I think that was a tragic mistake, and until it is corrected, we will continue to suffer under it. This is why I think there is no salvation in Christianity or any of the other monotheistic faiths. They all have the same problems.",

   "I would never tell any gay person to turn his or her back on their religion.\n\n \n You don't verbally tell them too, but your position sort of demands it, be default. How can someone who's religion involves believing that sex outside of a man<-<woman marriage is immoral not be expected to turn their back on that religion, if you indeed do disagree with that way of thinking? You may not be actively saying \"turn your back on it\" but the only way to embrace your position on this is to do so. That's why I said I think you have a tall order with your position, if you have interest in convincing religious people of it. \n \n \nIt is the conservative Christian churches that put gay people in an impossible position, by telling gay people that we cannot be ourselves and be Christian and be saved.\n\n \n Look, conservative Christianity isn't controlled by \"conservative Christian churches.\" These churches ARE conservative Christians. These conservative churches come about simply because conservative people (the parishoners) come together over religion that is already there and in place. That's all a church really is (in evangelicalism anyway)--Christians coming together in a group. Conservative Christianity (which is really just taking the Bible for what it says on moralistic matters of what not to do sexually) is simply going by what they believe God tells them is right. There's no conspiracy going on here against gays. Also, I think most conservative Christians churches would not take the position that you can't be 'saved' under those circumstances. They might say that such a person is out of the will of God, but most of these churches that I know of don't hinge religious salvation on whether one has gay sex or not. They certainly think it's wrong, but then they think many other things are wrong as well.\n \n \nI have heard many conservative Christians say that there is no such thing as a gay Christian, that you cannot be gay and be a Christian.\n \n .... they argued, God intends for everyone to marry a person of the opposite sex and procreate. \n\n \n I think it's important to remember that conservative Christianity isn't monolithic here, and it varies somewhat from person to person. How varied was the group that you polled and discussed this with? Was it just a few people? Were they from various different churches around the country, or from just a few churches? Did they explain what they think it means to be 'saved', according to their religion? These are matters that very crucial to this discussion.\n \n \nI do not understand from reading your post how you think conservative gay Christians are supposedly able to live as conservative Christians without suppressing who they are.\n\n \n They can't. I never said they could. In fact, I pointed out that what you would prescribe as the best way to live their lives would require them to do just the opposite, and it would. But being a Christian requires suppressing \"who we are\" in many, many different ways. Doing so is a matter of deep personal religion, and involves one's relationship with their God. Again, their religion trumps their sexuality.\n \n \nYou seem to be suggesting that gay people can be conservative Christians just fine if they stay in the closet. But that's not fine with the conservative Christians I talked with, and I discussed this with many. They would argue that being closeted about one's same-sex relationships is still sinning.\n\n \n Well, see, this gets to a very fundamental aspect of the Christian faith--that we all sin, all the time, regardless, in that we are sinful. That's probably why they said that. I'm not suggesting it's EASY to be a conservative Christian being what you would call \"in the closet.\" It's often NOT easy to live the Christian life the way one believes God wants it lived.\n \n \nIf a conservative Christian really believes in the doctrine of the conservative Christian churches, then he or she cannot in good conscience live as a closeted gay person. That would be \"sinning,\" according to the doctrine of these churches.\n\n \n I think it would help this if you defined, specifically, what you mean by \"living as a closeted gay person.\" I don't mean just not-being-\"out\"-but-still-having-sex-on-the-side. Is that what YOU'RE talking about? Conservative Christians typically know that people are going to sin, in their thoughts, to some degree, every day. They don't hinge salvation (being a Christian) on that at all--in fact they tend to believe the very opposite--that salvation happens despite their sin, which is why the doctrine of atonement is so important in conservative Christian thinking. It's a part of life, so if you are talking about being attracted to people of the same sex without acting on it or letting one's thouhts get carried away, I think you are wrong in your assessment of conservative Christians.\n \n \nA person who believes in this doctrine would find life as a closeted gay person to be unacceptable, unless, of course, the person was entirely celibate.\n\n \n Ah, \"unless the person was entirely celibate\"--That tells me that you are talking about being in the closet as having the option of having sex on the side. No, that's not what I'm talking about. Make no mistake, conservative Christianity does not allow for having gay sex, just as it doesn't allow for having premarital sex (or sex under a number of conditions). You'd call that living in celibacy, I guess. \n \n \nIn my discussions with conservative Christians, I met a couple of celibate gay people who had chosen celibacy because they believe that \"homosexuality\" is a \"sin.\" They were struggling with celibacy, and they admitted this. They were not finding this an easy path. I do not fault them for choosing this path, if that is what they want. But they said that it is a great struggle for them.\n\n \n I'm sure they were struggling. But the Christian life is not without struggle, in terms of many, many issues. This is the bottom line. Whoever it was that you met were EXACTLY the sort of people I'm talking about. Please don't take this offensively, but you aren't privy to their personal religious relationship with God, and their life is their business. \n \n \nThe issue here is not being closeted or not. The issue is the fact that conservative Christian churches make it impossible for gay people to live their lives as full human beings and be conservative Christians.\n\n \n Again, \"conservative churches\" are just conservative Christians who happen to be in a group. They aren't holding a gun to peoples' heads. And even with their beliefs, it's no more so than any other thing pertaining to what Christianity forbids. How do you know their lives aren't fulfilling in other ways, just because they told you it was a struggle? You don't have any idea what their religious life is like. Again, there is a whole other side to this you aren't privy to. Your view seems to assume that fulfillment in life is only found in being able to do what one's sexuality would be oriented toward, and I think that gives people way too little credit. These people find fulfillment in other ways unrelated to sexuality--ways that you don't know about, frankly. Countless people have done just fine without having sex. For these Christians, life just doesn't hinge on that. It doesn't hinge on their sexuality. Their sexuality is trumped by things more important to them. And you probably aren't going to understand that because it's not the life you've chosen. That's fine. But these Christians haven't chosen your life either, which is also fine.",

I have not argued that gay Christians should do or not do anything when it comes to their religious faith. It's entirely up to them what faith they choose and how they choose to live within that faith. I said several times that I don't believe in telling people what faith to embrace. And I am not the one who has made being a gay conservative Christian pretty much impossible. I have simply noted that it is. How gay Christians may respond to the stances of their own churches is entirely up to them. I am not advocating that they do anything in particular. I have no position that I am urging gay Christians to embrace. I personally have observed that gay Christians are happier in more liberal Christian churches that accept gay people as we are, and that's indicated by how few gay people belong to conservative Christian churches and by how many gay people have joined more liberal and accepting churches. But I am not arguing that gay Christians should choose or not choose either one. I am simply making observations based on my lengthy conversations with a wide range of Christians, including about a dozen very conservative Christians.\n \n \nLook, conservative Christianity isn't controlled by \"conservative Christian churches.\" These churches ARE conservative Christians. These conservative churches come about simply because conservative people (the parishoners) come together over religion that is already there and in place. That's all a church really is (in evangelicalism anyway)--Christians coming together in a group. Conservative Christianity (which is really just taking the Bible for what it says on moralistic matters of what not to do sexually) is simply going by what they believe God tells them is right.

They might say that such a person is out of the will of God, but most of these churches that I know of don't hinge religious salvation on whether one has gay sex or not. They certainly think it's wrong, but then they think many other things are wrong as well.\n\n \n As to your point that conservative Christian churches are just Christians coming together in a group, that's not really true for many churches. It's probably true for some, but the conservative Christians with whom I discussed these issues came from a variety of faith traditions, including Catholicism, Anglicanism, the Southern Baptist tradition, the Pentacostal tradition, Lutheranism, and various non-denominational churches. Each one is different. Roman Catholic parishes are certainly not just a group of Christians coming together. They are part of a huge hierarchical church body, with doctrines and rules and practices that have been long established. The Southern Baptists are supposed to have congregational polity, similar to my own tradition of Unitarian Universalism. But recently the Southern Baptist Convention has punished individual congregations for violating the Convention's doctrine on accepting gay people. I think it's a huge oversimplification to say that Christian churches are just Christians coming together. That's true of some churches, but not of all. \n \n Is there a conspiracy against gay people among conservative Christians? There doesn't have to be. The anti-gay attitudes are incredibly strong among the conservative Christians with whom I spoke. I was shocked by the passion of their anti-gay attitudes, to be honest. I really was not expecting it. \n \n Most of the people with whom I spoke did assert that gay people cannot be Christians and cannot be saved. I am simply reporting what folks said. A few disagreed with this, but not the majority. One person told me that I am going to burn in a fiery lake. Others said that those who don't renounce homosexality have no chance at salvation; we will all end up in hell. And several people said that even those who support accepting gay people as gay are going to hell for it. \n \n I realize quite well that conservative Christianity is not monolithic, and different people with whom I interacted expressed somewhat different viewpoints. But I was struck by the extent to which the conserative Christians I spoke with were unwilling to accept gay people and got pretty hysterical in their denunciations of \"homosexality.\" When asked whether they would say the same things to people who are divorced, they mostly either did not answer, or they noted that divorce is a sin also, but divorced people often cannot help getting divorced. They made excuses for divorced people, as they continued to denounce gay people.",

Make no mistake, conservative Christianity does not allow for having gay sex, just as it doesn't allow for having premarital sex (or sex under a number of conditions). You'd call that living in celibacy, I guess. \n \n \n \n I'm sure they were struggling. But the Christian life is not without struggle, in terms of many, many issues. This is the bottom line. Whoever it was that you met were EXACTLY the sort of people I'm talking about. Please don't take this offensively, but you aren't privy to their personal religious relationship with God, and their life is their business. \n \n \n \n Again, \"conservative churches\" are just conservative Christians who happen to be in a group. They aren't holding a gun to peoples' heads. And even with their beliefs, it's no more so than any other thing pertaining to what Christianity forbids. How do you know their lives aren't fulfilling in other ways, just because they told you it was a struggle? You don't have any idea what their religious life is like. Again, there is a whole other side to this you aren't privy to. Your view seems to assume that fulfillment in life is only found in being able to do what one's sexuality would be oriented toward, and I think that gives people way too little credit. These people find fulfillment in other ways unrelated to sexuality--ways that you don't know about, frankly. Countless people have done just fine without having sex. For these Christians, life just doesn't hinge on that. It doesn't hinge on their sexuality. Their sexuality is trumped by things more important to them. And you probably aren't going to understand that because it's not the life you've chosen. That's fine. But these Christians haven't chosen your life either, which is also fine.\n\n \n So, I have from the mouths of gay conservative Christians testimony that being celibate is for them a struggle. Where do you get your information about their religious lives? How do you know what their religious lives are like and whether this struggle of theirs is worth it? You seem to want to believe that it is, but you seem just to be making this up, because you want to believe it. \n \n I have simply reported what people said to me. I have not told any gay Christian how to live. It's the conservative Christian churches that do that, as well as individual conservative heterosexual Christians. I had people say to me repeatedly, \"Don't be gay. Come to Jesus and repent. Let Jesus change you.\" I have never said anything like that to any gay person or to any Christian. I have never said, \"Don't be Christian. Abandon your faith and have sex and be happy.\" I would never say that to anyone, because I respect whatever faith people choose, and I respect how different people decide to live their lives. But that is not the attitude I heard from nearly all of the conservative Christians I interacted with. They were eager to tell gay people to stop being gay or we will go to hell. They said little else, to be honest. \n \n I also interacted with liberal Christians in this dialogue, and the conservative Christians told them that they are going to hell also because of their acceptance of gay people. The liberal Christians engaged in intense arguments with the conservative Christians about scripture and about what the Bible says about homosexuality. I mostly kept silent about scripture, as I do not adhere to it. This was a debate among people who regard the Bible as God's word and who interpret its meaning differently. \n \n One thing I realized after this whole dialogue with different Christians is that \"homosexuality\" is the big issue currently dividing Christians, and the folks I talked with are intensely engaged in debates over whether \"homosexuality is a sin\" or not. \n \n I would like to address your point that for conservative Christians, faith trumps sexuality. The problem with this argument is that conservative heterosexual Christians do not give up the right to marry for their faith. Priests and nuns do, but just about no one else does, and fewer and fewer people are becoming priests and nuns. Most heterosexual Christians don't give up their sexuality for their faith, nor do they give up an intimate life partnership for their faith, which is more important. They just expect gay people to do that. \n \n It's unfair of someone to demand that other people sacrifice an intimate love relationship with a spouse for their faith when they are not willing to do the same themselves. And the conservative Christians that I see are not willing to do what they demand that gay people do, and that's either to be celibate and single for life or to go into an \"ex-gay ministry\" to try to become heterosexual, which probably never really changes anyone's sexual orientation. \n \n But whatever I may think of the position of conservative Christians and conservative Christian churches toward gay people, it's entirely up to gay Christians whether they choose to belong to these conservative churches or not. And I see very few choosing to belong to them.",

That's true of some churches, but not of all.\n\n \n I'd agree in terms of all of them, but one of the hallmarks of fundamentalist evangelical churches is that they usually aren't really under any real church hierarchy and authority.

It is certainly something your movement has done plenty of, though.\n\n \n I do not go around trying to change the minds of either church leaders or religious gay people about \"gay relations.\" I work for the equal treatment of gay people under the law. I work to counter the efforts of religiously motivated activist groups that seek to deny gay people equal treatment under the law. I do not tell people what to believe or not believe as part of their faith. I will tell them when asked what I believe, but I do not tell them what they should believe. What people believe as part of their religion is up to them. I don't agree with much of what conservative Christians believe, but I don't go around telling them not to believe it. \n \n In my conversations with the conservative and liberal Christians, when I asked them how they think gay people should be treated under the law, their reponses were mixed. A sizeable minority of the conservative Christians said gay people should be treated as equals under the law except for marriage. Another minority said that gay relations should be entirely illegal. Most of the liberal Christians said that gay people should have equal rights including the right to marry our spouses. I find it interesting that some of the conservative Christians, while denouncing same-sex relationships as \"sin,\" were not advocating making our relationships illegal. They drew a distinction between \"God's law\" and \"man's law,\" and they seemed rather less concerned with secular civil laws than with church doctrine and practice. I personally am fine with people believing that \"homosexuality is a sin\" so long as those people do not work to deny gay people equal treatment under the law. People should be free to believe what they want. The problem comes when they try to enact religious beliefs into civil law and to discriminate against other people under the law. And while some of the conservative Christians did advocate enacting their beliefs into secular law, many did not. This I found encouraging.\n \n I have not, in my posts, attempted to make judgments of conservative gay Christians. Indeed, I have said repeatedly that I don't make such judgments. I have simply been reporting what the people I spoke with told me. And while I respect your experiences as a conservative Christian, you have no idea how many or even whether there are closeted gay people in conservative Christian churches if those gay people are in the closet. In my conversations, I did speak with two conservative gay Christians who are not in the closet, but who have chosen lifelong celibacy. They have said that this is a struggle for them, and they said they felt torn between their commitment to their faith and their desire to find a spouse (of the same sex) and marry. Both of them were young, and it would be interesting to see what choices these two people make in the future. I really don't care what choice they make; that's their business. It would just be interesting to see what they end up doing. I will note that the conservative churches do not demand that their heterosexal members make such a choice, which I personally think is unfair to gay people. But it's really not my business, as I do not belong to these churches, and they are free to hold whatever doctrine they wish. \n \n I do not speak for gay people, nor do I speak for conservative Christians or for conservative Christian gay people. I speak only for myself, and I am simply reporting what the various Christians I spoke with said.\n \n I have never told any gay person that he or she should come out or be out. Nor have I told any church what doctrine they should espouse. You claim that my \"movement\" has done so. What is your evidence for this? I know of no gay rights group that has tried to tell gay people they should come out. The gay rights groups work to win equality and fair treatment under the law, and to win legal protections so that gay people CAN come out. They have never demanded that gay people do come out. \n \n You may be thinking here of the debate over \"outing\" public figures. This is a wholly different argument than insisting that ordinary gay people come out, because of the role of public figures. And it's been individuals who have argued for outing public figures; I know of no gay rights group that actively espouses this or does it. Most of the individuals who call for outing public figures have called for outing political leaders and public leaders who espouse inequality for gay people while leading secret gay lives themselves.\n \n The only activist groups that I know of who have been working to try to change the doctrines of conservative churches are activists within the Christian faith and within the specific denominations themselves. Gay and gay supportive Episcopalians have worked to promote the acceptance of gay people within their church body. That's perfectly legit for them to do, as they are Episcopalians. It's not my business to try to change the doctrine or the practices within the faith of the Episcopal Church. To the extent that any church becomes active in promoting secular laws and in the broader civil arena, then I think their efforts become fair game for gay rights groups as well as individuals to challenge. But I think it's up to Christians themselves, and specifically to the Christians within any given church body or faith tradition, to challenge the religious doctrines and practices of those churches. I regard other people's religious doctrines as their business, until they seek to impose their religious doctrines on me or on everyone else through laws. \n \n I am aware that the Southern Baptist Convention espouses congregational polity, just as our Unitarian Universalist Association does. However, as I pointed out in one of my previous posts, the SBC has recently violated its own principle of congregational polity and has sought to punish and to kick out congregations that are welcoming to gay people. They have acted in a hierarchical fashion when it has come to gay people. They did this in Atlanta with two congregations that were gay affirming.",

Your statements appear to be based purely on speculation. I know there are many gay people in liberal and accepting Christian churches. We can see them. Your argument that there are many closeted gay people in conservative churches may be true, but you don't know that it's true, and you have presented no evidence for it. My statements are based on what we actually know about gay Christians. I think we would need someone to take a poll of gay Christians to get a more complete picture of how many gay people there are in Christian churches and what churches they belong to. \n \n Individuals saying something is not the same as the gay rights \"movement\" saying it, or working for it. Individuals are not the same as gay rights organizations. I do not speak for any gay rights organizations. I sometimes speak about them, but I cannot and do not speak for them. As I said before, I speak only for myself, not for any organization or any other individuals posting here. Sometimes I agree with other gay posters, and sometimes I disagree with them. I have always spoken for myself and myself alone. When I quote or paraphrase someone else, I make clear that I am quoting or paraphrasing them. \n \n I have never made a \"charade\" of neutrality. I am not neutral in my views about gay rights or in how I think churches should treat gay people. I have never claimed to be neutral. I don't, however, tell anyone what faith they should or should not embrace or that they should leave their faith tradition. That's entirely up to them. You may think that I think they should leave their faith tradition, but again that's just an assumption on your part of what I think. I honestly do not care what faith tradition someone else embraces. \n \n I will criticize church leaders for things they say publicly about gay people. There's a difference between criticizing church leaders for the public stances they take in the wider society and telling an individual that he or she should leave his or her faith. I have no interest in telling anyone what their faith should be. People get to make those choices for themselves, and it's not for me to criticize them. Please recognize that I make a distinction here between individual choices for their own lives and the public activism of church leaders, whether ordained or lay leaders, to try to shape public policy. The latter is fair game for criticism by Christians and non-Christians, because we are all part of the wider society that religiously based activists seek to shape. I myself am a religiously based social justice activist in the wider public arena, and I fully expect people to respond to and sometimes to criticize my activism. It's appropriate that people should consider and criticize what I work for in the wider society. That's different from them denouncing me for my faith or telling me that I should not be a Unitarian Universalist. I have encountered conservative Christians who have said that to me, and it's offensive. I am not going to do the same to them, and I really have no interest in telling anyone else what their faith should be.\n \n Your use of the term \"gay pride proponents\" seems odd to me. The people I have seen posting here seem to be proponents of equal rights for gay people. It's certainly what I have been advocating. The expression \"gay pride\" seems vague to me and not all that meaningful. I care about equality under the law and in the wider society. \n \n I have said that I would never tell someone what faith tradition they should espouse. I will tell people that what they are doing is wrong if they try to deny gay people equal rights under the law. That clearly is wrong. People who worked for women's right to vote confronted many conservative Christians who argued on the basis of religion that God never intended women to vote. These conservative Christians were active in the wider public arena, working to prevent women from winning the vote. Of course people should have said that what they were doing was wrong. It was wrong, and these conservative Christians were working to limit women's rights not just within their churches, but in the wider civil society. They were not just advocating doctrine within their faith traditions; they were trying to prevent women from having equal rights under the law in the public arena. \n \n It is wrong for people to try to prevent gay people from having equal rights under the law. I have long said this, and I will continue to say this. The fact that people argue on the basis of their religion for limiting people's rights in the public arena should not shield them from criticism for taking that position, nor should it exempt them from opposition to what they advocate. One people enter the public arena and push for laws that affect everyone, they become fair game for criticism. That's true of me and my religiously based activism, and it's true for conservative Christians and their religiously based activism.",

   "You made statements about the beliefs of closeted gay people in conservative Christianity. Your statements appear to be based purely on speculation. I know there are many gay people in liberal and accepting Christian churches. We can see them. Your argument that there are many closeted gay people in conservative churches may be true, but you don't know that it's true, and you have presented no evidence for it.\n\n \n Are you intentionally misrepresenting my argument, or unintentionally? Because you are misrepresenting it. In fact, I made no such argument. I did NOT argue that there are \"many closeted gays people\" in these churches, as you claim. I pointed out--countered--that because there MIGHT be (and there probably are), you have no way of knowing for certain if there are more gays in liberal ones or not. You're misrepresenting what I said. \n \n And in terms of whether or not there are closeted gays in conservative Christian churches, considering that a.) gays generally make up anywhere from 2-10% of the population, and b.) being in the closet is far more likely in a conservative church than a more liberal one simply on the basis that's the only way a gay person can often even be in these churches, I don't see how anyone could possibly conclude there aren't gays in the closet in conservative Christian churches. So again, your argument (and yes, it was your argument--I can link back to your post--#309--if you want me to) that there are more gays in liberal Christian churches than conservative ones, cannot be known. You based your assertion, specifically, (in your own words) on \"how few gay people belong to conservative Christian churches and by how many gay people have joined more liberal and accepting churches.\" Neither of those factors take closeted gays into account. You made the assertion. I pointed out why you cannot possibly know what you argued for certain.\n \n \nIndividuals saying something is not the same as the gay rights \"movement\" saying it, or working for it. Individuals are not the same as gay rights organizations. I do not speak for any gay rights organizations.\n\n \n Nevertheless, you argue regularly for gay rights and seem to identify quite strongly with gay pride. You may not be on any particular organisations' membership roll, but surely you cannot possibly expect anyone to not view your posts as arguing toward the movement you associate with here. I do realise that individuals and movements are not the same concept, but it is still what you argue for, and therefore represent. I'm not criticising over that, I'm just pointing out what seems pretty obvious to me. You seem defensive over it.\n \n \nYour use of the term \"gay pride proponents\" seems odd to me. The people I have seen posting here seem to be proponents of equal rights for gay people. It's certainly what I have been advocating. The expression \"gay pride\" seems vague to me and not all that meaningful. I care about equality under the law and in the wider society.\n \n \n Why? What other phrase are we supposed to use for those who are in the interests of gay pride? Why not think of the phrase with ... er, well, pride? It is gays who came up with the phrase \"gay pride\"; no one else. I think you are incorrect if you think that only the legal aspect (rights) are fought toward by your movement. It seeks cultural change too, and that's where (IMO) the 'pride' aspect comes into play. \n \n \nPlenty of the conservative Christians with whom I recently interacted told me that I should stop being gay or end up in hell, and they told me that I should turn to Jesus.\n\n \n All 12 of them? \n \n \nSo when you say, \"Nobody is asking you to,\" it's just not true. I know from experience that it's not true.\n\n \n What I mean is that no one HERE is asking JAKE to. Now you're doing exactly what you were defensive over toward me by moving away from arguing over the individualistic to the general. \n \n \nI don't see a whole lot of gay people running around trying to talk conservative Christians out of their faith.\n\n \n emoticon_confused emoticon_confused emoticon_confused \n \n I suppose none of any of these posts by those arguing against Christians who believe gay relationships are immoral that come up on these forums are really real then! emoticon_xdonno Clearly you aren't understanding what I'm trying to say here.

That's what it is you don't seem to understand, and I think that lack of realisation is ultimately the problem here.\n \n Every TIME someone argues against Christians over their belief on this (and it does happen here, frequently), they are, in essence, trying to talk conservative Christians out of their faith. And every time someone argues against conservative Christians who believe it is a religious matter to oppose gay marriage, they are, in essence, trying to talk conservative Christians out of their faith.

You wrote this: \n \n \"Your view seems to assume that fulfillment in life is only found in being able to do what one's sexuality would be oriented toward, and I think that gives people way too little credit. These people find fulfillment in other ways unrelated to sexuality--ways that you don't know about, frankly. Countless people have done just fine without having sex. For these Christians, life just doesn't hinge on that. It doesn't hinge on their sexuality. Their sexuality is trumped by things more important to them. And you probably aren't going to understand that because it's not the life you've chosen. That's fine. But these Christians haven't chosen your life either, which is also fine.\"\n \n There is a whole lot of presumption in your statement here, Jyoshu. First of all, you presume to know what my life is like. You don't know whether I have sex or not. You have no idea. I have never told you anything about my sex life or what sexuality means in my life. I have made arguments for fair and equal treatment for gay people under the law, and I have made arguments for legalizing same-sex marriage. It's legal marriage that is central to my efforts. Not sexuality. I want us gay people to have the equal right to marry our beloved spouses legally, so that we have the same opportunity to form an intimate lifelong legal partnership and legal family relationship that benefits our children and our spouse and that commits each of us to our families legally as well as emotionally. \n \n You also make presumptions about my religious commitments, and about the importance of faith in my life. You imply that faith matters less to me than sexuality, which is absurd, frankly. You are saying this to someone who attends church every week and sometimes more often than that, who chairs my church social justice committee, and whose life revolves around faith and the church. That's me. I think my life is more like that of many conservative Christians than you have ever imagined. I work for equal and fair treatment for gay people in large part out of my religious faith, not out of a desire for anything having to do with my sexuality. My work for equality for gay people flows from my religious beliefs; it does not contradict my religious beliefs. \n \n You also presume to speak here for gay conservative Christians about what sexuality means to them and what religion means or should mean to them. These are the gay conservative Christians you supposedly made no claim about existing. But here you say there are \"countless people\" who have chosen a life of celibacy rather than acting on their gay sexuality because, you say, sexuality matters less to them than their faith. Again, you speak for other people whose existence you cannot even demonstrate. And you seem very comfortable in suggesting that other people should give up sexual expression and intimate love and family lives, while you are not willing to do the same. That's the double standard that I find so offensive in the outlook of the conservative Christians that I have spoken with, including you. You would demand that gay people sacrifice for their faith the family life that you and most other conservative Christians would never be willing to sacrifice for yourselves. As I have said, this is not my fight, and it's entirely up to conservative gay Christians if they want to live by this double standard. It's also why there are probably very few gay conservative Christians; they have more accepting churches where they can go. \n \n \nNevertheless, you argue regularly for gay rights and seem to identify quite strongly with gay pride. You may not be on any particular organisations' membership roll, but surely you cannot possibly expect anyone to not view your posts as arguing toward the movement you associate with here. I do realise that individuals and movements are not the same concept, but it is still what you argue for, and therefore represent. I'm not criticising over that, I'm just pointing out what seems pretty obvious to me. You seem defensive over it. .\n\n \n As I said earlier, I do not speak for the gay rights movement or for any movement. I speak only for myself. I do not speak for any organization. I do not speak for all gay people. I speak as a gay person, but I speak as an individual gay person, not for all gay people. I do not speak for all Unitarian Universalists either, nor do I speak for Unitarian Universalism as a church association. I speak as a UU, not for all UUs. I am not saying this to be defensive; I am saying it to be accurate. Please don't assume that I believe something just because some other gay people say it or because you imagine our movement supports it. \n \n As for the expression \"gay pride,\" I am happy to express pride at an annual march, though I haven't been to one in about 6 or 7 years. But that's not what I focus on in my work for gay rights. I already have pride in who I am; I don't need to advocate it. The expression makes no sense to me.\n \n This is a forum about gay rights. Why not use the more precise and accurate and meaningful expression \"gay rights,\" or else just \"equal rights?\" \n \n [QUOTE=jyoshu;295599] All 12 of them?\n \n Yes, all 12 of them, plus others who popped in and out of the discussion periodically. These folks came from a variety of conservative Christian traditions. \n \n \nApparently you still haven't come to the realisation that there's no way for someone to accept and embrace what gay pride folks here argue (against religion, and yes, it happens here quite often) without being talked out of their faith. That's what it is you don't seem to understand, and I think that lack of realisation is ultimately the problem here.\n \n Every TIME someone argues against Christians over their belief on this (and it does happen here, frequently), they are, in essence, trying to talk conservative Christians out of their faith.

You can't have one without the other. It doesn't work that way. Because what they are doing is a religious thing. It IS a matter of faith.\n\n \n I realize what you are arguing. I disagree with it. Being anti-gay is NOT central to any branch of Christianity that I know of, except perhaps for Fred Phelps' church, and all of the conservative Christians I spoke with denounced Fred Phelps. Arguing for churches to accept gay people as we are is not the same as arguing against someone's faith. It's arguing against one single belief, a belief that is not central to Christianity. \n \n People have long argued against the conservative view that women should be silent in church and that women must not lead churches, and over time many churches gradually changed to open up new opportunities for women to serve as ministers and lay leaders. Those churches are still vibrant and are still Christian. Changing to open opportunities to women did not cause people to lose their faith. And the argument that women should be fully included was and is not an effort to talk conservative Christians out of their faith. It was an effort to make Christianity more inclusive and more fair to women. \n \n Likewise, the call for Christians to accept gay people as we are is not an effort to talk conservative Christians out of their faith. Most of the people making this effort are themselves Christians. They are not trying to talk their fellow Christians out of their faith. They are trying to improve Christianity by making it more inclusive and more fair to gay people. As I said before, this is not my battle. It's a battle within Christianity. My faith tradition already accepts gay people as we are. So the battle within Christianity is not a battle I engage in. I observe it with interest, but it's up to Christians to decide whether to accept gay people as we are and what their approach to gay people will be.",

Your little fiction, in which you suggest that gay Christians really don't care about having relationships and really don't want to marry, is something you made up so you can feel okay about treating gay people unequally and unfairly. You made this up to rationalize the double standard of heterosexual conservative Christians like yourself who would deny gay people marriage and a family life while insisting on having them for themselves.\n \n That's what this is, Jyoshu. You want to rationalize your unfairness, and you want to excuse your fellow conservative Christians for insisting on something that on its face is obviously wrong. That's all you're here for, to rationalize inequality and to try to excuse it. \n \n I see through you, Jyoshu. The emperor has no clothes.",

   "I had no idea you were in the U.K. I have no idea to what extent conservative churches in the UK preach and deal with this topic. I can say for certain though, that the conservative churches here in the US that I've been a part of really don't even talk about it that much. Whether that's because they don't need to or because other issues are more paramount (which is my theory), the bottom line is that's what I've observed.\n \n \n \n No, that's a different side of it. I'm talking about the religious side for these conservative Christians.\n \n \n \n Some of them don't! There are many people that God tells to not act on their desires, from all walks of life.\n \n \n \n Again you aren't taking into account that these people are concerned about higher issues. We're talking about people (conservative Christian gays) who find meaning and fulfillment in something higher (a spiritual thing) than sexual and romantic relationships between people. I suspect there's no way I'm ever going to be able to adequately explain that to you, because I don't think you can identify with it. So I see no point in continuing to try.\n\n \n You are making up your little stories again, Jyoshu. First you say that you never claimed there were these conservative Christian gays, because they are in the closet, and yet you keep claiming to know what they think. You make yourself feel noble and good by pretending that these imaginary conservative gay Christians really don't care about relationships and marriage. It makes you feel good about yourself to pretend that the people you treat unequally are happy to be treated that way. But it's nonsense, Jyoshu.

   "Not only did you claim that there are many closeted gay people in conservative Christian churches, you presumed to speak for them, to speak for their religious experiences. You wrote this: \n \n \"Your view seems to assume that fulfillment in life is only found in being able to do what one's sexuality would be oriented toward, and I think that gives people way too little credit. These people find fulfillment in other ways unrelated to sexuality--ways that you don't know about, frankly. Countless people have done just fine without having sex. For these Christians, life just doesn't hinge on that. It doesn't hinge on their sexuality. Their sexuality is trumped by things more important to them. And you probably aren't going to understand that because it's not the life you've chosen. That's fine. But these Christians haven't chosen your life either, which is also fine.\"\n \n There is a whole lot of presumption in your statement here, Jyoshu. First of all, you presume to know what my life is like. You don't know whether I have sex or not. You have no idea. I have never told you anything about my sex life or what sexuality means in my life.\n\n \n Now wait a second. On one hand you say I'm presuming about conservative Christian gays, then you use yourself as an example of whom I'm being presumptuous about. But you aren't a conservative Christian, Ohioprof. That's the whole point. If it's conservative Christians I'm talking about (and it is), and you're not one, then how on earth could I be presuming about you? I'm not presuming anything about you.\n \n Second, certainly at no point have I presumed anything about your sexual life, nor do I care. You're presuming to think that I have and do.\n \n I've already said you're privy to the 'gay' side of the matter. You certainly know more about being gay than I do, that's for certain. I've said that already. But I doubt you understand what it's like to be a conservative Christian as much as I do, simply because you aren't one (and I assume never have been), and I have been (and still am in some ways). If you have been, then please just say so. That's pretty straightforward logic--not blind presumption. And it's the conservative Christian side of this I'm talking about.\n \n Finally, I did NOT claim that there are many closeted gays in conservative Christian churches. I said there MAY be. There's a huge difference in those two statements. And so again, you're misrepresenting what I said. And again, I don't see how anyone could possibly conclude that there wouldn't be closeted gays in conservative Christian churches, based on the reasons I've already given you.\n \n You're not even really addressing what I'm saying at all. I don't see how you can possibly read that section you just quoted, then go into a spill about me presuming over your sexual life. I've done no such thing.\n \n \nYou also make presumptions about my religious commitments, and about the importance of faith in my life. You imply that faith matters less to me than sexuality, which is absurd, frankly.\n\n \n Nope. I am simply 'presuming' you aren't a conservative Christian, and therefore can't identify with what that involves as well. You're reading WAAAAAY more into my posts than I've written or intended. \n \n \nI think my life is more like that of many conservative Christians than you have ever imagined.\n\n \n emoticon_confused Is that something you want? I would think, given that they oppose you having gay rights, you'd NOT want to be like conservative Christians. But look, even with other issues, let's find out, shall we? (I'm not asking you to answer any of these \"out loud\" if you don't want to, but I ask these simply to point out the implications of what you're saying.) Do you believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, and that it is the true word of God? How about God truly as Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit)? I mean really believe it? Do you really believe, honestly, that Jesus resurrected from the dead, and that He is returning to earth one day? Not that could be, but that it DID and WILL happen? Or that there is a hell and a heaven, and that accepting Christ is the only way to heaven? If you can't answer yes to those (particularly the ones related to a high view of Biblical scripture), then IMO you're nowhere near the same page in terms of the way most conservative Christians think. Now you may not like my litmus test. But these are very much hallmark matters of most conservative Christians, so I think it gets to the heart of the matter.\n \n \nI work for equal and fair treatment for gay people in large part out of my religious faith, not out of a desire for anything having to do with my sexuality. My work for equality for gay people flows from my religious beliefs; it does not contradict my religious beliefs.\n\n \n That's great! I have no problem whatsoever with that.\n \n \nYou also presume to speak here for gay conservative Christians about what sexuality means to them and what religion means or should mean to them. These are the gay conservative Christians you supposedly made no claim about existing. But here you say there are \"countless people\" who have chosen a life of celibacy rather than acting on their gay sexuality because, you say, sexuality matters less to them than their faith.\n\n \n Down through history, yes, there have indeed been countless people who have chosen a life of celibacy, and there are people who still do. I wasn't just talking about gays, I was talking about people in general. Gays are people, after all. But yes, in terms of this exchange, I unapologetically do presume to speak for conservative Christians (whom these gays you speak of are) because I feel I understand their viewpoint at least to some degree. \n \n \nAnd you seem very comfortable in suggesting that other people should give up sexual expression and intimate love and family lives, while you are not willing to do the same. That's the double standard that I find so offensive in the outlook of the conservative Christians that I have spoken with, including you.\n\n \n Those conservative Christians you say you're more like that I've ever imagined? :) Look, nowhere have I demanded OR suggested gays live a certain way. Your claims of my suggestions ande presumptions are, themselves, presumptions. But I do understand their belief and claim (because it's a religious one, not a 'gay' one) that God may want them to live against their desires as a human being.\n \n \nYou would demand that gay people sacrifice for their faith the family life that you and most other conservative Christians would never be willing to sacrifice for yourselves.\n\n \n Really? Where have I demanded that? Please, do prove this claim.\n \n \nAs I said earlier, I do not speak for the gay rights movement or for any movement. I speak only for myself. I do not speak for any organization. I do not speak for all gay people. I speak as a gay person, but I speak as an individual gay person, not for all gay people. I do not speak for all Unitarian Universalists either, nor do I speak for Unitarian Universalism as a church association. I speak as a UU, not for all UUs. I am not saying this to be defensive; I am saying it to be accurate. Please don't assume that I believe something just because some other gay people say it or because you imagine our movement supports it.\n\n \n I never claimed you speak for all gays or every single person in the gay pride/rights movement, or ALL UUs. Nevertheless it is your movement. You do argue for it, and on behalf of it in the sense of what its values are. I'm not suggesting you're a part of some monolithic organised group or something--I'm using the term \"movement\" loosely here. I don't mean it's organised. It would be like someone saying \"there's a big Irish music movement going on in Dublin\" or something.\n \n \nThis is a forum about gay rights. Why not use the more precise and accurate and meaningful expression \"gay rights,\" or else just \"equal rights?\"\n\n \n Because it's not just about the legal rights. The movement seems to be about cultural change as well, and as I said, that's where (IMO) the 'pride' aspect comes into play. I don't think 'gay pride' is an inaccurate phrase. \"Gay rights movement\" isn't comprehensive enough, because it doesn't take into account cultural change. You mentioned this forum--if this forum becomes limited to posts strictly about the rights issue, rather than cultural change too, then I would be more inclined to limit my phraseology to \"gay rights.\"\n \n \nI realize what you are arguing. I disagree with it. Being anti-gay is NOT central to any branch of Christianity that I know of, except perhaps for Fred Phelps' church, and all of the conservative Christians I spoke with denounced Fred Phelps. Arguing for churches to accept gay people as we are is not the same as arguing against someone's faith. It's arguing against one single belief, a belief that is not central to Christianity.\n \n \n Well, we're going to have to disagree on this one, though I don't see how you could reasonably disagree. This issue gets into the inerrancy and high view of the Bible, and that's where I think you've missed the mark here in terms of the way conservative Christians often view this issue. It's not that \"anti-gay\" is central to conservative Christianity, it's that the high view of Biblical scripture is central. And to accept gay relationships as ok means going against scripture on a fairly clearcut issue (biblically speaking). I remember seeing an interview a couple of years ago pertaining to the U.S. Episcopal split over the issue of gay clergy where a conservative in one of the exiting churches stated (in his view) that this issue is ultimately about whether \"this book [the Bible] means what it says.\" He didn't say the central issue of the split was gay people or being anti-gay. What he simply meant was that he couldn't bring himself to go against what the Bible says--and that's central to his religion. If you think conservatives aren't essentially being expected or asked to go against their beliefs and religion, then you're kidding yourself.\n \n \nPeople have long argued against the conservative view that women should be silent in church and that women must not lead churches, and over time many churches gradually changed\n\n \n Well, if the Bible said that, then they were essentially asked to change their beliefs (which you say you aren't doing to conservative Christians) and in that case they did. So the example only shows what I'm saying--that conservatives are being asked to do so. And so now those churches aren't conservative Christian churches anymore. Conservative Christian churches I know of don't allow for women to pastor churches. By the way, FWIW, most Christians (conservatives included) don't (and didn't) interpret Paul to mean women can't even open their mouths with voice inside a church building.\n \n \nThose churches are still vibrant and are still Christian.\n\n \n :) I note that you didn't add the term \"conservative\" though, alongside 'vibrant' and 'Christian'.\n \n \nLikewise, the call for Christians to accept gay people as we are is not an effort to talk conservative Christians out of their faith.\n\n \n I agree, and would not say that it is. However, I do notice that you seem to be arguing for more than just gay rights, right now. You're arguing for gays to be \"accepted as we are\". What do you mean by that? Just given rights, or accepted in other ways too, in terms of how people see them?",

You don't apparently know any conservative Christian gay people. I am not attributing false claims to you; I have quoted your claims about what they think. \n \n If you want to argue that you know what matters to these conservative Christian gays whose existence you cannot even demonstrate, then you have to provide some evidence that (1) they really exist, and (2) that you know what they think. I presented evidence of what some conservative Christians think by reporting on direct conversations that I had with them. There were, as I said, two conservative Christians gays in this group who talked about what their faith means to them and how being celibate is a struggle for them. To which you replied that I cannot possibly know what their faith means to them. But I know more than you about this, as I actually asked them about their faith, and you didn't. You just presume to know what conservative gay Christians think, even though you don't know any apparently, because you want to believe that they are happy with lifelong celibacy and with sacrificing the opportunity to have a family. \n \n Maybe the two I spoke with will be happy being celibate and single for life. Or maybe they won't. As I said earlier, they are both young. I made no argument to them about what they should or should not do, because it's not my place to do that.

You want to believe that there are all these conservative Christian gays who are happy being told they must be single for life, because then that would make the anti-gay positions of conservative Christian churches seem not so bad. It's all rationalization on your part, to try to defend conservative Christian churches in their mistreatment of gay people. They can mistreat gay people within their churches if they want to; that's religious liberty. But don't expect many gay people to be part of those churches. Many gay people, people whom I know personally, fled those churches as soon as they were old enough to get out and get away. They didn't flee because they put sexuality ahead of faith. They fled because those churches are hostile to who they are as people and those churches do not allow gay people to lead full lives, to have families, and be accepted as Christians. \n \n I was raised in a Christian church: a Lutheran church, to be specific.

Nonsense. It's just exclusion and discrimination, and it does real harm to gay young people who grow up in those church environments. Fortunately, gay Christians can leave these conservative churches and find other Christian churches that accept us for who we are and extend a real welcome to gay people.

If you have been, then please just say so. That's pretty straightforward logic--not blind presumption. And it's the conservative Christian side of this I'm talking about.\n\n \n You have been talking about conservative Christian GAY PEOPLE. You apparently don't know any, but you talk about what conservative Christian gay people, whom you don't know, think and believe. I actually asked some conservative Christian gay people what they think and believe. They were only two people, but I really asked them questions about their lives and their faith. And I do not judge them for their faith, nor would I try to talk them out of their faith. Their faith is their personal business. I do not evangelize. \n \n For you to claim that you know what conservative Christian gay people think is a huge presumption, since you have presented no evidence from any actual conservative Christian gay people.\n \n FYI, I grew up in a theologically conservative Lutheran church. I tried as a teenager to believe in what they espoused, but I found that I could not. I left as soon as I reached adulthood. \n \n \n Finally, I did NOT claim that there are many closeted gays in conservative Christian churches. I said there MAY be. There's a huge difference in those two statements. And so again, you're misrepresenting what I said. And again, I don't see how anyone could possibly conclude that there wouldn't be closeted gays in conservative Christian churches, based on the reasons I've already given you.\n\n \n So now you say there MAY be many conservative gay Christians, but you still presume to tell us what these people, whom you say MAY exist, think and believe.\n \n The problem with your claim that gays represent a certain percentage of the population and must therefore be in conservative churches in those numbers is that gay people are not spread evenly through all locations and groups. Gay people tend to be concentrated in cities rather than in rural areas and small towns. That's because gay people frequently move to cities so they can live in communities with other gay people. Atlanta, where I used to live, has a huge gay population, made up mostly of gay people who fled the rural South to the big city in search of community and acceptance. The same is true in churches. Adults choose their church home. And most of the gay people I know have left the churches in which they grew up, including me. Those who remained Christian have gone to more liberal and accepting Christian churches. They have not stayed in churches that label \"homosexuality\" a \"sin.\" Gay people mostly don't feel welcome there. \n \n \nI would think, given that they oppose you having gay rights, you'd NOT want to be like conservative Christians. But look, even with other issues, let's find out, shall we? (I'm not asking you to answer any of these \"out loud\" if you don't want to, but I ask these simply to point out the implications of what you're saying.)

Now you may not like my litmus test.

I am not like them in doctrine, and I do not view faith as a matter of doctrine. For me, faith is a practice, not a doctrine. You made the claim that for conservative Christians, religion trumps sexuality. I would say that that is true for me also. My faith trumps my sexuality. I work for equal and fair treatment for gay people out of my religious faith, not because I put sexuality first. My faith and my sexuality are not inconsistent, just as your faith and your sexuality are not inconsistent. But in my life, my faith is central, as I have said. \n \n Do I agree with the various doctrinal tenets that you just laid out? No. For me, faith is not doctrine. It's a practice. \n \n \nDown through history, yes, there have indeed been countless people who have chosen a life of celibacy, and there are people who still do. I wasn't just talking about gays, I was talking about people in general. Gays are people, after all. But yes, in terms of this exchange, I unapologetically do presume to speak for conservative Christians (whom these gays you speak of are) because I feel I understand their viewpoint at least to some degree.\n\n \n Again, you presume to know what conservative Christian gay people think and believe. But you don't. You can't assume that gay Christians hold identical beliefs to heterosexual Christians. Nor can you assume that all conservative Christians think alike. You yourself said that they don't. I found that the conservative Christians I spoke with do not agree with each other on all issues, and the two gay conservative Christians had different perspectives on \"homosexuality\" than did the heterosexual conservative Christians I spoke with.\n \n You also have not addressed my point that the conservative Christian churches demand that gay people be celibate and single for life, or else go to an \"ex-gay ministry\" to try to change themselves into heterosexuals. These churches do not make such demands of heterosexuals. Heterosexals like you can choose to be single for life and not have an intimate relationship or a family. But you aren't expected to choose this. You can have a family if you choose to and be accepted and applauded for this. Conservative churches encourage heterosexuals to marry. But they do not allow gay people to marry the spouse of their choice and be accepted in those churches. Gay people are given no real choice; they are forced either to be celibate and single or to try to change into who they are not. That's a double standard, and it's unfair to gay people. \n \n \nWell, we're going to have to disagree on this one, though I don't see how you could reasonably disagree. This issue gets into the inerrancy and high view of the Bible, and that's where I think you've missed the mark here in terms of the way conservative Christians often view this issue. It's not that \"anti-gay\" is central to conservative Christianity, it's that the high view of Biblical scripture is central. And to accept gay relationships as ok means going against scripture on a fairly clearcut issue (biblically speaking). I remember seeing an interview a couple of years ago pertaining to the U.S. Episcopal split over the issue of gay clergy where a conservative in one of the exiting churches stated (in his view) that this issue is ultimately about whether \"this book [the Bible] means what it says.\" He didn't say the central issue of the split was gay people or being anti-gay. What he simply meant was that he couldn't bring himself to go against what the Bible says--and that's central to his religion. If you think conservatives aren't essentially being expected or asked to go against their beliefs and religion, then you're kidding yourself.\n\n \n It's not true that the Bible is clear about \"homosexuality.\" That's what the arguments between liberal and conservative Christians that I listened to were about. They argued over the meaning of scripture. There are only a very few verses in the Bible that may deal with homosexuality, though it's not even clear that they do. There are more Bible verses that support slavery and that call for the subordination of women than there are Bible verses that may address homosexuality. Jesus never said anything on the subject. And nowhere does the Bible condemn or even address same-sex marriage. The Bible is entirely silent on this question. \n \n I listened to a lot of conservative Christians argue about what the Bible says about homosexuality. I listened to a lot of liberal Christians argue about this. And it's clear to me that both sides are interpreting the Bible in different ways. It's not clear that the Bible condemns homosexuality. That's an interpretation. \n \n As for whether allowing women to be pastors meant that conservative Christian churches were no longer conservative, I think that too is a matter of interpretation. There are theologically conservative Christian churches that do allow women to be pastors. \n \n Let's consider the issue of slavery, which divided Christian churches and led to some denominations splitting apart in the 19th century. The Southern Baptist Convention emerged as the proslavery branch of the Baptists, and the American Baptist Convention emerged as the antislavery branch of the Baptists. Are the churches in the Southern Baptist Convention proslavery today? Certainly they are not. Does that mean they are no longer conservative Christian churches? Of course they still regard themselves as conservative. But they have given up the belief that led to their founding, and that is the belief that the Bible condones slavery and that Christians should therefore support slavery.\n \n Christians have changed their interpretations of and their understandings of the Bible over time, and that includes conservative Christian churches. I will submit to you that conservative Christians can come to embrace gay people as we are without giving up either their conservatism or their Christianity. But as I have said before, it's up to them whether they do. That's not my fight. I will certainly say what I think about this when asked, but I am not going out crusading for churches to change their theology. I am working to stop churches and individuals from denying gay people equal treatment under the law in the wider civil society. \n \n My position on my own gay rights activism is like my stance on evolution. I think conservative Christians should be entirely free to reject evolution if they want to, and I am not going into conservative Christian churches to demand that they accept evolutionary theory. I will say what I think about this when the subject comes up. But I am not crusading to change people's theology within their churches. That's up to the members of those churches, if that's what they want to do. I do and will, however, stand up against conservative Christians trying to impose their religious beliefs on everyone else through laws that mandate the teaching of their religious beliefs about creation in the public schools.",

   "You made claims in which you presume to know what conservative Christian gay people, whose existence you cannot even demonstrate\n \n The problem with your claim that gays represent a certain percentage of the population and must therefore be in conservative churches in those numbers is that gay people are not spread evenly through all locations and groups. Gay people tend to be concentrated in cities rather than in rural areas and small towns.\n\n \n Well again, I know for a fact that there are gays in conservative Christian churches, because a.) I've known a few, and b.) the very existence of the ex-gay movement demonstrates there are gays in conservative Christian churches. So I think it's pretty much a given that there are. Think about it: There are literally millions of conservative Christians out there in conservative Christian churches and it only stands to reason that some of them would be gay. Also, you're point about gay people tending to concentrate in cities doesn't really speak to anything here, because there are plenty of conservative Christian churches in cities too. In fact, the largest ones tend to be in cities, naturally. Look, let's be realistic. I think surely you know as well as I do that I should not need to \"demonstrate\" the existence of gays among conservative Christians. Gays are in all walks of life. Do you think all gays are out now, and there are no more in the closet???\n \n \n... are thinking. You don't apparently know any conservative Christian gay people. I am not attributing false claims to you; I have quoted your claims about what they think.\n\n \n As a matter of fact I do. But that shouldn't matter--you should know gays exist across the spectrum of life. There is no reason to think there aren't closeted gays in conservative Christian churches. The very fact the ex-gay movement exists proves there are gays in conservative Christian churches. I can't believe you aren't even on board with this simple matter. \n \n \nIf you want to argue that you know what matters to these conservative Christian gays whose existence you cannot even demonstrate, then you have to provide some evidence that (1) they really exist,\n\n \n Ok. Ex-gay movement: gays fighting their nature .... in conservative Christian churches. There you go. They exist. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n(2) that you know what they think. I presented evidence of what some conservative Christians think by reporting on direct conversations that I had with them.\n\n \n Ok then, since you're using 'conversations' as evidence, I've talked to many, many conservative Christians over the course of my life. Probably hundreds, maybe thousands. I used to BE one. You either did or didn't. There you go, my evidence is as strong as yours, and possibly stronger. But who cares? It it really that important to you to think you know more than me on this? \n \n I think this needs to be taken back to square one. I don't disagree with what they told you. I don't disagree with your statements about the conversations. I'm really not even sure why you're taking such issue with what I'm saying. I simply wanted to point some things out from my own standpoint of belief in terms of having been a conservative Christian, and having spent a lot of time around them in my life. I simply wanted to point out that this goes to a very deep matter spiritually for these people. That doesn't mean you aren't spiritual, or don't know God. I've presumed nothing about you.\n \n \nThere were, as I said, two conservative Christians gays in this group who talked about what their faith means to them and how being celibate is a struggle for them. To which you replied that I cannot possibly know what their faith means to them.\n\n \n Where did I say 'you cannot possibly know what their faith means to them'? Are we reading the same thread? I believe I said 'you cannot possibly know for certain that there are more gays in liberal churches than conservative ones'. But I do stand by my assertion that, because you aren't a conservative Christian and haven't been one, then you probably don't understand their viewpoint and what makes them tick as well as someone else might has been one. I don't see what the problem is with that statement. \n \n \nBut I know more than you about this\n\n \n Ok, fine. You know more about it than I do. I'm not interested in the least in a \"I-know-more/you-know-more\" contest. It's not THAT big a deal to me. I was simply trying to bring a perspective to you, in terms of conservative Christianity, as one who's been one. If you want to think you know more, that's fine with me. I don't care. \n \n \nMaybe the two I spoke with will be happy being celibate and single for life. Or maybe they won't. As I said earlier, they are both young. I made no argument to them about what they should or should not do, because it's not my place to do that. It's up to them to choose their faith, to choose their spiritual path.\n\n \n I agree, it's up to them. It's possible they consider their spirituality as a conservative Christian more important than their sexuality.\n \n \nAnyhow, I stand by what I said in my earlier post. You apparently don't even know any gay conservative Christians, and yet you presume to tell us what they think. But you really don't know. You are making it all up, to try to make the unfairness of the way conservative Christians treat gay people seem okay.\n \n I am speaking what I think is a truth that you don't want to face. You are looking for ways to rationalize ...\n \n Don't pretend you don't know what I am saying. You don't want to face the truth ...\n\n \n None of this is true, and is itself presuming, on your part.\n \n \nSo now you say there MAY be many conservative gay Christians, but you still presume to tell us what these people, whom you say MAY exist, think and believe.\n\n \n No, not just now. You're not being honest. I said \"MAY\" earlier. I can link the post and quote it for you, but this is getting pretty ridiculous, IMO.\n \n \nYou have been talking about conservative Christian GAY PEOPLE. You apparently don't know any, but you talk about what conservative Christian gay people, whom you don't know, think and believe.\n \n For you to claim that you know what conservative Christian gay people think is a huge presumption, since you have presented no evidence from any actual conservative Christian gay people.\n \n\n \n Again, it is not true that I don't know any. But again, that isn't necessary to have some understanding of the conservative Christian viewpoint, in the first place. I've already stated I realise and fully state that you, naturally, know more about the gay side of the matter--being gay. But these gays are also conservative Christians, and that's where I feel I at least can understand where they are coming from (on THAT side of the issue) in terms of how they view God and scripture. I think it's unfortunate that this conversation, because of your defensiveness over something that's not even that big of a deal, has digressed into accusations and taken some strange psychoanalytical bent. There's no need to argue over something like this. I don't see why what I'm saying is so offensive to you. I'd much rather be discussing these folks and the problems they face. But if you aren't even willing to accept the idea that I might be able to identify with the conservative Christian mindset, am I to assume you're not going to listen to a thing I say here?\n \n \nI actually asked some conservative Christian gay people what they think and believe. They were only two people, but I really asked them questions about their lives and their faith\n\n \n What did those two people tell you? I'm curious.\n \n \nFYI, I grew up in a theologically conservative Lutheran church. I tried as a teenager to believe in what they espoused, but I found that I could not. I left as soon as I reached adulthood.\n\n \n Alright. Thanks for telling me that. I don't know that much about Lutherans. For a lot of evangelical Christians (and yes, I know there evangelical Lutherans), I think the high view of scripture is what drives them. And because the Bible does speak of gay sex as something not to do, they believe this way. Which seg-ways into something you said I'd like to address ...\n \n \nIt's not true that the Bible is clear about \"homosexuality.\" That's what the arguments between liberal and conservative Christians that I listened to were about. They argued over the meaning of scripture. There are only a very few verses in the Bible that may deal with homosexuality, though it's not even clear that they do. There are more Bible verses that support slavery and that call for the subordination of women than there are Bible verses that may address homosexuality. Jesus never said anything on the subject. And nowhere does the Bible condemn or even address same-sex marriage. The Bible is entirely silent on this question.\n\n \n I agree it's not clear about \"homosexuality\" in terms of sexual orientation, which of course they didn't even know about back then. But for some or many conservative Christians, it is pretty clear-cut in terms of sex between two people of the same gender. And of course, the Bible doesn't mention gay marriage because for the Biblical writers, such a concept was so far out in left field, it wasn't covered. There was no gay marriage at the time. Furthermore, sex was something understood within the concept of marriage. But when the Bible forbids sex between two people of the same gender, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that gay marriage does not jibe with the way scripture views homosexual relations. This is the way a lot of conservative Christians view this issue. Yes, I realise these passages could be ignored or re-interpreted to mean something else, but I see no reason to do so just because it's not politically correct these days. I say let the Bible say what it says, and let the chips fall where they may.\n \n \nYou also have not addressed my point that the conservative Christian churches demand that gay people be celibate and single for life, or else go to an \"ex-gay ministry\" to try to change themselves into heterosexuals. These churches do not make such demands of heterosexuals. Heterosexals like you can choose to be single for life and not have an intimate relationship or a family.

Gay people are given no real choice; they are forced either to be celibate and single or to try to change into who they are not. That's a double standard, and it's unfair to gay people.\n\n \n In many cases, I think they're just acting on their belief system. (And again, this why I said earlier--and Lesz seems to agree to some extent--that there's no way to change this without these people turning their backs on that belief system.) They don't expect the same for heterosexual relationships because those aren't immoral in their view, and the other is. That's the bottom line.",

Do you think all gays are out now, and there are no more in the closet??? .\n\n \n If you are going to purport to speak for them and tell us what conservative gay Christians think and believe, then yes, you do need to demonstrate that what you are saying is not just something you made up. You do need to support your claims for both the numbers of conservative gay Christians and especially for what you claim they think and believe. You can't just insist that because you have been a conservative Christian for a long time that you know what conservative gay Christians think. And yes of course there are some conservative gay Christians. I spoke with two of them, as I said, and I asked them questions about what they believe and about what their experiences are like. But you referred in an earlier post to \"countless people\" I am not sure exactly what \"countless people\" means, but it sounded to me like you claiming that there are many closeted conservative gay Christians, which is what \"countless people\" sounds like. But you have no evidence for this. The existence of an \"ex-gay movement\" is not even very good evidence, as the founders of the \"ex-gay ministry\" called Exodus have recently repudiated the whole thing and have apologized for ever starting this \"ex-gay ministry.\" Interestingly, they have said that they are still evangelical Christians. But they never did become \"ex-gay,\" and they have said that their whole \"ex-gay\" enterprise never turned anyone \"ex-gay.\" These folks, one of whom is Michael Bussee, are interesting because they are examples of committed evangelical gay Christians who now argue that gay people should be accepted as they are.\n \n My point about gay people in the cities was simply to show that gay people are not equally distributed in the wider population, because gay people often move to places where they feel welcome and accepted and can find a community. Just as many gay people move to cities to find acceptance within a community, many gay people leave conservative Christian churches and find other churches where they feel welcome and accepted. \n \n The closet is not the issue here. The motivation of many gay Christians, whether they are closeted or not, is to find churches that do not denigrate who they are and do not insist that their living full lives with families is a \"sin.\" That was certainly the motivation of dozens of gay people whom I know who have left conservative Christian churches. I am one of them. \n \n \nOk then, since you're using 'conversations' as evidence, I've talked to many, many conservative Christians over the course of my life. Probably hundreds, maybe thousands. I used to BE one. You either did or didn't. There you go, my evidence is as strong as yours, and possibly stronger. But who cares? It it really that important to you to think you know more than me on this?.\n\n \n Whether I know more than you about this is not the issue. The issue is that you have been making claims about what GAY conservative Christians supposedly believe and think, and you have NOT known hundreds of GAY conservative Christians. You say you have known personally only a \"few\" conservative gay Christians. So you really do not know what gay conservative Christians think. \n \n We are not talking about what heterosexual conservative Christians think, because they can believe that homosexuality is a sin without sacrificing anything. It takes no courage to believe that homosexuality is a sin if you're heterosexual. You can just point fingers at other people and make claims about other people's sin, and you don't have to give up anything. There is no courage in that. It's doing exactly what Jesus said not to do: to judge others. These heterosexual conservative Christians may indeed have a deep spiritual belief about this, at the expense of other people. It's the gay conservative Christians whom these very spiritual heterosexual Christians expect either to deny who they are or try to change who they are. As I said before, heterosexual conservative Christians expect gay people to live their entire lives single, without a family, or else to try to change their nature into someone they are not. But these heterosexual Christians never impose that requirement on themselves. They just impose it on gay people. That's why so many gay people leave these conservative Christian churches. \n \n \nWhere did I say 'you cannot possibly know what their faith means to them'?\n \n \n You wrote this: \"These people find fulfillment in other ways unrelated to sexuality--ways that you don't know about, frankly....Their sexuality is trumped by things more important to them. And you probably aren't going to understand that because it's not the life you've chosen.\"\n \n You said this about my life. \n \n \nBut I do stand by my assertion that, because you aren't a conservative Christian and haven't been one, then you probably don't understand their viewpoint and what makes them tick as well as someone else might has been one. I don't see what the problem is with that statement.\n\n \n You presume to know what makes people tick even though you don't know them. You cannot assume that gay conservative Christians think as you do. Their experience is not yours. Yet you are making this assumption. I don't assume that I know what they think either, which is why I asked some of them about it. \n \n \nI agree, it's up to them. It's possible they consider their spirituality as a conservative Christian more important than their sexuality.\n\n \n Yes, it's possible. Now there is a fair statement. \n \n \nAgain, it is not true that I don't know any. But again, that isn't necessary to have some understanding of the conservative Christian viewpoint, in the first place.\n\n \n THE conservative Christian viewpoint? You imagine that all conservative Christians share one viewpoint? You imagine that GAY conservative Christians share this same viewpoint? How do you know they do? \n \n Just as there is not one gay viewpoint, there is not one conservative Christian viewpoint, from what I have seen. There are many different viewpoints. \n \n \nI've already stated I realise and fully state that you, naturally, know more about the gay side of the matter--being gay. But these gays are also conservative Christians, and that's where I feel I at least can understand where they are coming from (on THAT side of the issue) in terms of how they view God and scripture.

You cannot speak for them, because you don't have any evidence of what they think. You know what YOU think, not what conservative gay Christians think. Similarly, I cannot speak for other gay people. The fact that I am gay does not mean I know what all gay people think. I speak only for myself, unless I have evidence of what other gay people think. \n \n \nWhat did those two people tell you? I'm curious.\n\n \n I'll say more about that when I have some more time. My daughter is calling me to spend time with her. \n \n \nI agree it's not clear about \"homosexuality\" in terms of sexual orientation, which of course they didn't even know about back then. But for some or many conservative Christians, it is pretty clear-cut in terms of sex between two people of the same gender.

I say let the Bible say what it says, and let the chips fall where they may..\n\n \n But what you are saying the Bible says is just your interpretation of what the Bible says. It's not that liberal Christians are \"re-interpreting\" what the Bible says. All Christians are interpreting the Bible. Conservative Christians are interpreting the Bible to say what they believe about homosexuality. The Bible in its original languages never said anything about \"homosexuality.\" The term didn't even exist. And it's an interpretation to believe that the Bible forbids same-sex sex. Plus the Bible calls for the death penalty for men who lie with men as with a woman, and most conservative Christians conveniently ignore that (Fred Phelps doesn't ignore it.) \n \n Your assertion that \"it's not rocket science\" to figure out that same-sex marriage \"does not jibe\" with scripture is clearly your interpretation of the Bible's complete silence on same-sex marriage. You assume, based on your other interpretations, that the Bible must intend to condemn same-sex marriage. But it never does. You are interpreting silence to mean what conservative Christians think it should mean. \n \n \nthere's no way to change this without these people turning their backs on that belief system\n\n \n I disagree. Conservative Christians have changed their beliefs about divisive issues before, like slavery, which produced a huge scriptural fight. They eventually gave up their belief in slavery. That did not cause them to turn their backs on their belief system. They just began to interpret the Bible differently on this particular question. \n \n Plenty of Christians have chosen to reject the idea that \"homosexuality is a sin.\" They are still committed Christians. They have not given up their belief system, just one specific belief. And it's a belief that is not central to Christianity.",

You do need to support your claims for both the numbers of conservative gay Christians and especially for what you claim they think and believe.\n\n \n Even though I've claimed no numbers? Why should I back up claims I haven't made? The ONLY numbers I've purported is that gays make up anywhere from 2-10% of the general population. I didn't say those same number apply to these churches. Furthermore, I disagree that something so obvious as closeted gays being in conservative churches should need to be demonstrated or proven. It's pretty silly to expect someone to prove something like that. I stand by that.\n \n And again, it's not \"conservative gay Christians\" I'm claiming to have some understanding of, but rather simply \"conservative Christians.\" It so happens that, in all likelihood, some of them happen to be gay. You're creating categories here arbitrarily. There is no logical reason I can think of to assume being gay is, in any way, related to being a conservative Christian. It's not the \"gay\" part I could identify with, but rather the \"conservative Christian\" aspect, and I've now told you this several times. But you keep proceeding and answering as if I haven't told you this. \n \n \nYou can't just insist that because you have been a conservative Christian for a long time that you know what conservative gay Christians think.\n\n \n I said I think I can somewhat understand and identify with them. I didn't say \"I know what they think.\" Why do you keep taking what I've said and making it out to be more excessive than I've said it? Naturally, I'm not going to know everything they think. Please, if you are going to respond and allude, just respond and allude to what *I've said*, instead of making it out to be something more or different. I think you've read what I've said, and in your thinking you are offended that I would dare purport to be able to identify with someone, in any way whatsoever, who happened to be gay. Even though way I'm purporting to be able to identify with them has nothing to do with them being gay at all. But I've said, repeatedly now, that's not the issue I could identify with. That's not what I'm talking about. I think having a conservative Christian background better helps me understand where conservative Christians are coming from. These people are wrestling with issues related to scripture, inerrancy, conservative interpretation, the socialistic aspect of conservative Christian churches, etc. I've been around this stuff and have wrestled with the same issues regarding inerrancy and high view of scripture. Why that bothers you so for me to say that, I have no idea.\n \n \nThe closet is not the issue here. The motivation of many gay Christians, whether they are closeted or not, is to find churches that do not denigrate who they are and do not insist that their living full lives with families is a \"sin.\" That was certainly the motivation of dozens of gay people whom I know who have left conservative Christian churches. I am one of them.\n\n \n The closet IS an issue, because we don't need to discount those gay people in this conversation. THAT'S where gays in conservative churches would, in all likelihood, be.\n \n \nWhether I know more than you about this is not the issue. The issue is that you have been making claims about what GAY conservative Christians supposedly believe and think, and you have NOT known hundreds of GAY conservative Christians. You say you have known personally only a \"few\" conservative gay Christians. So you really do not know what gay conservative Christians think.\n\n \n Again, this is an arbitrary category you've created. They are still conservative Christians, and therefore likely hold to a lot of the same tenets as other conservative Christians. (That's exactly why they probably feel they're between a rock and hard place--their religious belief is juxtaposed to what they naturally feel is normal.) I see no reason why being a \"GAY conservative Christian\" would involve significantly different religious beliefs than many \"conservative Christians\". Why do you think there is some difference? It's not like sexuality is related to Biblical inerrancy here. You either believe in it or you don't. If you're gay and believe in it, then it's going to involve working toward a life of celibacy, more than likely.\n \n \nWe are not talking about what heterosexual conservative Christians think, because they can believe that homosexuality is a sin without sacrificing anything. It takes no courage to believe that homosexuality is a sin if you're heterosexual.\n\n \n emoticon_confused emoticon_confused How is a conservative Christian not a conservative Christian, gay or not??? You seem to have this idea that while I may identify with conservative Christians, the moment we add the word \"gay\" to the equation, suddenly I can't identify with them in terms of their conservative Christian beliefs. This is utter nonsense. Of course I can't identify with them in terms of being gay. I've said that now, multiple times to you. I've said I'm sure it's a struggle for them. But that's not what I'm saying I could identify with.\n \n Goodness, you're making a Mt. Everest out of a molehill here.\n \n \nYou can just point fingers at other people and make claims about other people's sin, and you don't have to give up anything. There is no courage in that. It's doing exactly what Jesus said not to do: to judge others.\n\n \n Huh? emoticon_wow I haven't judged anyone here. I've said I can understand--identify--with being a conservative Christian. I don't think anyone should judge or condemn them.\n \n \nThese heterosexual conservative Christians may indeed have a deep spiritual belief about this, at the expense of other people. It's the gay conservative Christians whom these very spiritual heterosexual Christians expect either to deny who they are or try to change who they are. As I said before, heterosexual conservative Christians expect gay people to live their entire lives single, without a family, or else to try to change their nature into someone they are not. But these heterosexual Christians never impose that requirement on themselves. They just impose it on gay people. That's why so many gay people leave these conservative Christian churches. \n\n \n You seem to think that the only reason these gay conservative Christians choose to live the celibate life is because they're being told to do so by someone else. Why do you assume this? It stands to reason that you could have every church in the world cease ever saying anything about homosexuality or gay relations at all, and it would not change what the BIBLE says. They'd still read it. They'd still have that high view of scripture because ... (DING!) ... that's a hallmark of conservative Christianity. And that doesn't even take into account that some simply feel called, directly by God, to such a life of celibacy. I'm sure it's easy to blame churches because they are visible establishments, but churches are made up of Christians. These are also individual beliefs we are talking about.\n \n \nYou wrote this: \"These people find fulfillment in other ways unrelated to sexuality--ways that you don't know about, frankly....Their sexuality is trumped by things more important to them. And you probably aren't going to understand that because it's not the life you've chosen.\" You said this about my life.\n\n \n Did you choose a conservative Christian life? Did you choose to have a high view of Biblical scripture? You may find it annoying or offensive that I would make such an assumption about you, but if you can't say you've chosen that, then you're not there. You're NOT wrestling with scripture and Biblical authority. I stand by this.\n \n \nTHE conservative Christian viewpoint? You imagine that all conservative Christians share one viewpoint? You imagine that GAY conservative Christians share this same viewpoint? How do you know they do?\n\n \n Yep--if they don't hold to some pretty standard tenets, then they aren't conservative Christians, Ohioprof. \n \n \nJust as there is not one gay viewpoint, there is not one conservative Christian viewpoint, from what I have seen. There are many different viewpoints.\n\n \n Being gay has nothing to do with ideology. Being religious does. Those are incompatible in terms of analogy for the purpose of this discussion.\n \n \nBut what you are saying the Bible says is just your interpretation of what the Bible says.\n\n \n No, not mine--it's a conservative Christian interpretation. Which is pretty much the whole point here. Many conservative Christians read the Bible this way, and apparently some in your arbitrary category of 'conservative gay Christian' do as well, given that numerous of them try the ex-gay thing.\n \n \nAnd it's an interpretation to believe that the Bible forbids same-sex sex.\n\n \n Heh ... well I'd love to know how one would interpret \"a man shall not lay with a man\" differently than what it simply says. The spade sure looks like a spade to me.\n \n \nI disagree. Conservative Christians have changed their beliefs about divisive issues before, like slavery, which produced a huge scriptural fight. They eventually gave up their belief in slavery. That did not cause them to turn their backs on their belief system. They just began to interpret the Bible differently on this particular question.\n\n \n Yes, and so they did exactly what I'm talking about--they turned their back on their belief concerning those issues. History proved them right to do so. These examples back up what I'm saying that conservative Christians will need to turn their back on these beliefs regarding this.\n \n \nPlenty of Christians have chosen to reject the idea that \"homosexuality is a sin.\" They are still committed Christians. They have not given up their belief system, just one specific belief. And it's a belief that is not central to Christianity.\n\n \n Straw man. I never said it was central, or that they weren't committed Christians.",

   "Heh ... well I'd love to know how one would interpret \"a man shall not lay with a man\" differently than what it simply says. The spade sure looks like a spade to me.\n\n \n Since I am watching a movie with my daughter, I will respond to only two of your points in this post, and I will try to get to your other points on another occasion. On this first point, what looks like a \"spade\" to you does not look that way to other Christians who interpret this passage of scripture differently from you. This is where listening to the scriptural arguments by Christians over \"homosexuality\" has been very interesting to me, though it's not a debate in which I participated. I just listened. And if you are going to \"call a spade a spade\" why don't you advocate the death penalty for men who lie with men, as that is in Leviticus also? You and most other conservative Christians pick and choose from scripture, and you interpret scripture, just as liberal Christians do. Just because your interpretation of a particular passage seems obvious to you does not mean that all Christians agree with your interpretation. Plenty of Christians, both gay and heterosexual, interpreted this passage differently from what you assume it means in the discussions that I listened to. \n \n \nYes, and so they did exactly what I'm talking about--they turned their back on their belief concerning those issues. History proved them right to do so. These examples back up what I'm saying that conservative Christians will need to turn their back on these beliefs regarding this..\n\n \n Except that's not what you said. Here is what you said: \n \n \"Every TIME someone argues against Christians over their belief on this (and it does happen here, frequently), they are, in essence, trying to talk conservative Christians out of their faith. And every time someone argues against conservative Christians who believe it is a religious matter to oppose gay marriage, they are, in essence, trying to talk conservative Christians out of their faith. You can't have one without the other.\"\n \n You did not simply say that conservative Christians would have to turn their backs on a specific belief to accept same-sex marriage. You said they would be talked \"out of their faith.\" But it's not true. Changing one's interpretation of the Bible on a specific issue, one that is not central to Christianity in the first place, is not being talked out of one's faith. It is just changing one's thinking about a specific issue. Conservative Christians have done this before without being talked \"out of their faith.\" \n \n \nStraw man. I never said it was central, or that they weren't committed Christians.\n\n \n Read what you said in the quotation above. You said that every time someone argues against the conservative Christian position on same-sex marriage, they are \"trying to talk conservative Christians out of their faith.\" Now you are backtracking and conceding that Christians who have changed their thinking about a specific issue are still committed Christians. It's true. They were not talked out of their faith. They changed their thinking about a specific issue, by reinterpreting the meaning of the Bible. \n \n The argument for Biblical inerrancy is not the same as an argument for rigid and unchanging interpretations of the Bible. Conservative Christians came, after a long and pitched battle, to change their minds about what the Bible says and means about slavery. Many conservative Christians have come to change their minds about what the Bible says and means about the role of women. Given that all understanding of the Bible is interpretation, Christians can and do reinterpret the Bible over time. Both liberal and conservative Christians have reinterpreted the Bible over time.",

Don't apologize, as Uk forum members may take it the wrong way.\n \n \nI have no idea to what extent conservative churches in the UK preach and deal with this topic. I can say for certain though, that the conservative churches here in the US that I've been a part of really don't even talk about it that much. Whether that's because they don't need to or because other issues are more paramount (which is my theory), the bottom line is that's what I've observed.\n\n \n Being ingnored when straight people are aknowledged and supported in their human desires for intimacy and family, isn't any better, and only re-inforces the double-standard.\n \n \nNo, that's a different side of it. I'm talking about the religious side for these conservative Christians.\n\n \n They've been taught God hates them and are in a second-class status to straight people, who get love and support and justice for living out this integral, innate, unchosen part of themselves. Thus, they hate themselves and act out accordingly.\n \n \nSome of them don't! There are many people that God tells to not act on their desires, from all walks of life.\n\n \n You prevaricate again. I think you know what I am talking about. These are very specific circumstances(like priests), and it does not create the double-standard or second-class status for heterosexuality in general. It doesn't have the same degrading social consequences for straight people in broad, general terms, as it does for gay people.\n \n \nAgain you aren't taking into account that these people are concerned about higher issues. We're talking about people (conservative Christian gays) who find meaning and fulfillment in something higher (a spiritual thing) than sexual and romantic relationships between people. I suspect there's no way I'm ever going to be able to adequately explain that to you, because I don't think you can identify with it. So I see no point in continuing to try.\n\n \n I don't believe that this choice is merely personal between the person and God, and takes place in a social vacuum. There is tremendous pressure from outside sources to make a choice. I don't believe gay people would have come up with it on our own, for all who are of our sexuality, if no one in these religions said anything, as you say further on in this thread I believe. People would naturally wish to be spiritually uplifted in all of our humanity, that includes those of us who are gay.",

That many death penalty crimes regarding straights in the Old Testament aren't enforced either in the New Testament? But notice that Adultery that was a stoning offense in the OT is no longer enforced either in the New Testament. But neither does the NT endorse or condone Adultery just as it doesn't condone homosexuality. The OT is the Age of the LAW, the NT is the Age of GRACE.

   "And again, it's not \"conservative gay Christians\" I'm claiming to have some understanding of, but rather simply \"conservative Christians.\" It so happens that, in all likelihood, some of them happen to be gay. You're creating categories here arbitrarily. There is no logical reason I can think of to assume being gay is, in any way, related to being a conservative Christian. It's not the \"gay\" part I could identify with, but rather the \"conservative Christian\" aspect, and I've now told you this several times. But you keep proceeding and answering as if I haven't told you this.\n\n \n The problem with this argument is that you assume that all conservative Christians think as you do, including gay conservative Christians. Since you hardly know any gay conservative Christians, you don't know that they think as you do. You just assume that they do, apparently because you want to feel okay about the way that conservative Christians think about and treat gay people. Why should I listen to what you say about gay conservative Christians, which is the subject we have been discussing, when you don't know anything about them? \n \n \nI said I think I can somewhat understand and identify with them. I didn't say \"I know what they think.\" \n\n \n On the contrary, you have attempted to speak for gay conservative Christians, and you have insisted that you know what they think. You have done it with statements like this: \n \n \"These people find fulfillment in other ways unrelated to sexuality--ways that you don't know about, frankly. Countless people have done just fine without having sex. For these Christians, life just doesn't hinge on that. It doesn't hinge on their sexuality. Their sexuality is trumped by things more important to them.\" \n \n Read what you wrote. You are claiming here to know what conservative gay Christians think. And you don't know what they think. You are just imagining what you think they should think. \n \n \nWhy do you keep taking what I've said and making it out to be more excessive than I've said it? Naturally, I'm not going to know everything they think. Please, if you are going to respond and allude, just respond and allude to what *I've said*, instead of making it out to be something more or different.\n\n \n I have quoted you directly, to show that you have claimed to know what gay conservative Christians think. Again, read what you wrote. You have attempted to speak for gay conservative Christians. It's not your place to do that. You have been making up beliefs and attributing them to people you do not know.\n \n You really should speak for yourself, not for groups of people, especially people you don't know. \n \n \nI think you've read what I've said, and in your thinking you are offended that I would dare purport to be able to identify with someone, in any way whatsoever, who happened to be gay.\n\n \n I don't care whether you identify with gay people or any people. I'm telling you that you have no business presuming to speak for gay conservative Christians, because you have no real knowledge about their lives. You are just making assumptions based on your own beliefs. \n \n \nI think having a conservative Christian background better helps me understand where conservative Christians are coming from. These people are wrestling with issues related to scripture, inerrancy, conservative interpretation, the socialistic aspect of conservative Christian churches, etc. I've been around this stuff and have wrestled with the same issues regarding inerrancy and high view of scripture. Why that bothers you so for me to say that, I have no idea..\n\n \n I'm sure you have. But that still does not mean you can speak for gay conservative Christians. We need to ask them what they think. \n \n \nAgain, this is an arbitrary category you've created.\n\n \n It's no more arbitrary than the broader category of \"conservative Christians.\" And it is the subject we have been talking about<b></b>: gay conservative Christians. \n \n \nThey are still conservative Christians, and therefore likely hold to a lot of the same tenets as other conservative Christians. (That's exactly why they probably feel they're between a rock and hard place--their religious belief is juxtaposed to what they naturally feel is normal.) I see no reason why being a \"GAY conservative Christian\" would involve significantly different religious beliefs than many \"conservative Christians\". Why do you think there is some difference? It's not like sexuality is related to Biblical inerrancy here. You either believe in it or you don't. If you're gay and believe in it, then it's going to involve working toward a life of celibacy, more than likely.\n\n \n You are assuming that a belief in Biblical inerrancy necessarily means that one believes that \"homosexuality is a sin.\" But that's not necessarily true. It's a particular interpretation of the Bible that \"homosexuality is a sin.\" I have had lengthy conversations with Christians who believe in Biblical inerrancy who do not believe that \"homosexuality is a sin.\" They believe that that notion is a misinterpretation of the Bible. \n \n Different Christians interpret the Bible differently, and different Christians who believe in Biblical inerrancy may interpret the Bible differently from each other. Not all self-described conservative Christians interpret the Bible the same way. From what I have seen, the most hotly contested Biblical questions today among Christians are about evolution and homosexuality.\n \n You are right that conservative gay Christians, at least the ones I have spoken with, seem to wrestle with the same kinds of theological issues that conservative heterosexual Christians wrestle with. But when it comes to homosexuality and the Bible, the stakes for gay Christians are very high and are deeply personal in ways that they are not for heterosexual Christians. The Christianity of heterosexual Christians does not revolve around how they think of homosexuality. But for gay Christians, this issue determines whether they will be accepted in their church community or not, and, in some people's thinking, whether they will be saved or not. It's important, therefore, that we not lump all conservative Christians together and instead consider how being gay may affect the thinking of this particular subset of conservative Christians. We need to gather evidence from them about what they think and what they believe. \n \n \nemoticon_confused emoticon_confused How is a conservative Christian not a conservative Christian, gay or not??? You seem to have this idea that while I may identify with conservative Christians, the moment we add the word \"gay\" to the equation, suddenly I can't identify with them in terms of their conservative Christian beliefs. This is utter nonsense. Of course I can't identify with them in terms of being gay. I've said that now, multiple times to you. I've said I'm sure it's a struggle for them. But that's not what I'm saying I could identify with.\n\n \n I am saying that you don't know what their beliefs are about homosexuality unless and until you ask them. Simply saying that you \"identify\" with them doesn't mean you know what they think. \n \n \nYou seem to think that the only reason these gay conservative Christians choose to live the celibate life is because they're being told to do so by someone else. Why do you assume this?\n\n \n I have made no claims about why gay conservative Christians may choose to live a celibate life. I have said that I know dozens of gay people who have left conservative Christian churches because of what those churches teach about homosexuality and because those churches do not accept gay people as they are. \n \n \nIt stands to reason that you could have every church in the world cease ever saying anything about homosexuality or gay relations at all, and it would not change what the BIBLE says.\n\n \n It could change what Christians think the Bible says. What the Bible actually says about homosexuality is unclear and is subject to interpretation. The interpretation of the Bible is what matters. The Bible says nothing at all about same-sex marriage. Many Christians today interpret the Bible's silence about same-sex marriage to mean that the Bible condemns same-sex marriage. But that's a leap of interpretation, and not all Christians interpret the silence that way. \n \n \nDid you choose a conservative Christian life? Did you choose to have a high view of Biblical scripture? You may find it annoying or offensive that I would make such an assumption about you, but if you can't say you've chosen that, then you're not there. You're NOT wrestling with scripture and Biblical authority. I stand by this.\n\n \n I have a chosen a faith-based life. I do read and read about and think about the Bible, all the time, in fact. I do not regard the Bible as my scripture, but I think about it a great deal, and I have been reading recently about the Gnostic Gospels. \n \n \nYep--if they don't hold to some pretty standard tenets, then they aren't conservative Christians, Ohioprof. \n\n \n Not all Christians agree on what the tenets of conservative doctrine are. Not all Christians interpret what the Bible says about \"homosexuality\" the same way. And what people believe about \"homosexuality\" is not central to Christian doctrine anyway.",

The verse speaks of a man who lies with a woman, and for that man not to lie with a man, and it's presented in this context of temple prostitution. It was meant as a warning to the Israelites to not adopt such practices done in the surrounding lands. Thus, the Jews did not do these things, no argument there. This seems to make more sense, when gay men don't lay with women, when we act on the basic, fundamental nature of being gay.",

   "You are assuming that a belief in Biblical inerrancy necessarily means that one believes that \"homosexuality is a sin.\" But that's not necessarily true. It's a particular interpretation of the Bible that \"homosexuality is a sin.\" I have had lengthy conversations with Christians who believe in Biblical inerrancy who do not believe that \"homosexuality is a sin.\" They believe that that notion is a misinterpretation of the Bible. \n\n \n No, not \"*homosexuality* is a sin\", but rather *sex between people of the same gender*. This is very clear in the scripture. There's no reasonable way to interpret it any differently short of simply ignoring what it says. This pretty much becomes a case of people wanting the Bible to say what they want it to say, and therefore pretending it's saying something different, calling it a different \"interpretation\". Pretending and interpreting are not the same thing, and the only way to make the Bible not indicate that a \"man shall not lay with a man\" is to literally pretend it doesn't say so. Interpretation still needs to be reasonable. There's reasonable interpretation, and there's interpretation to absurdity. We need to have reasonable interpretation, but taking a passage that says something so clearly as that and saying it doesn't mean what it says is like saying the commandment \"you shall not commit adultery\" doesn't really mean \"you shall not commit adultery\". Well, yeah, it probably simply means \"you shall not commit adultery.\" And \"a man shall not lay with a man\" in all likelihood means what it says too. IMO, it's a harder case to make in saying the Bible doesn't frown upon homosexual behavior (notice I said homosexual behavior--NOT 'homosexuality'), than to say that it does. \n \n \nBut for gay Christians, this issue determines whether they will be accepted in their church community or not, and, in some people's thinking, whether they will be saved or not. It's important, therefore, that we not lump all conservative Christians together and instead consider how being gay may affect the thinking of this particular subset of conservative Christians. We need to gather evidence from them about what they think and what they believe.\n\n \n Sorry, but if they believe that the Bible doesn't indicate homosexual sex is sinful, then they aren't conservative Christians in a reasonable sense of the phrase. This is one issue that tends to be one of the dividing lines between conservatives and non-conservatives.\n \n \nThe problem with this argument is that you assume that all conservative Christians think as you do, including gay conservative Christians. Since you hardly know any gay conservative Christians, you don't know that they think as you do. You just assume that they do, apparently because you want to feel okay about the way that conservative Christians think about and treat gay people. Why should I listen to what you say about gay conservative Christians, which is the subject we have been discussing, when you don't know anything about them? \n \n On the contrary, you have attempted to speak for gay conservative Christians, and you have insisted that you know what they think. You have done it with statements like this\n\n \n Again, you've not shown how \"conservative gay Christians\" are any less \"conservative Christian\" than any other ones out there. For some reason, you seem to think that throwing \"gay\" into the equation prevents me from being about to identify with conservative Christians in terms of being a conservative Christian (not gay). You've repeatedly ignored what I've said on this, over and over, even though I've explained to you very carefully that it's only the conservative Christian part I'm purporting to be able to identify with. You keep saying I'm claiming to know what they think, and that I can't because you're throwing the \"gay\" qualifier into this arbitrary category you've created to defend this dogged position you've backed yourself into, even though I've told you repeatedly that what I claim to identify with has nothing to do with their being gay. Just because the \"stakes are higher\" really doesn't prove anything because what the \"stakes\" are over has nothing to do with what I am saying I can identify with them toward. And then you've specifically removed things like \"may\" from my assertions making them out to be more excessive than I've even said them. On top of all that, you took to a strange psychoanalytical bent, with things like \"you're caught\" when in fact there was nothing to be 'caught' over. Given those factors, I can only conclude you're pretty much just being stubborn at this point and aren't discussing this with any seriousness. Sadly, you've let this diversion of yours over something that's really not that big a deal either way detract from the meat of the topic which could have been a more meaningful conversation, IMO. With that, I digress.",

Do you adhere to that? Or do you conveniently ignore it. \n \n I could argue that conservative Christians interpret the Bible as condemning \"homosexuality,\" or \"same-sex relations,\" because that is what they want the Bible to say. And as I pointed out before, the Bible says nothing at all about same-sex marriage. For you or anyone to claim that the Bible condemns same-sex marriage is to read your interpretation of the Bible's silence as condemnation. You are reading your interpretation into the Bible.\n \n I also heard conservative Christians argue about the meaning of adultery. The meaning of terms is not necessarily what you assume it is. People understand different terms and different statements differently. \n \n \nSorry, but if they believe that the Bible doesn't indicate homosexual sex is sinful, then they aren't conservative Christians in a reasonable sense of the phrase. This is one issue that tends to be one of the dividing lines between conservatives and non-conservatives.\n\n \n So for you, the question of how a Christian regards same-sex relations is the litmus test for who is a conservative Christian? A person who describes him or herself as a conservative Christian who does NOT believe that same-sex relations are \"sin\" is not really a conservative, in your judgment? \n \n Shouldn't people get to define themselves? Where do you get the authority to decide who is or is not a conservative Christian? \n \n \nAgain, you've not shown how \"conservative gay Christians\" are any less \"conservative Christian\" than any other ones out there.

With that, I digress.\n\n \n I am telling you that you cannot speak for gay conservative Christians. I don't care whether you think you identify with them. That does not give you the authority or the knowledge to speak for them. You don't know what they think, and you cannot presume to tell us what people you don't know think. You are projecting your own beliefs onto people you don't know who are not you. \n \n To say, \"I suspect that gay conservative Christians might think thus and such,\" would be fine. To say, \"They believe thus and such\" is not fine, because you don't know. You need to ask them before you announce what they think. \n \n Your arguments are based on an assumption that all conservative Christians think alike. And you apparently will argue that any self-described conservative Christian who does not think as you do is not really a conservative Christian. But there are many varieties of conservative Christians. There are conservative Catholics, conservative Protestants, conservatives from different denominations, conservatives from non-denominational churches. There are pre-millennialists and post-millennialists. There are conservatives who are more Calvinist and conservatives who are more Arminian. There are conservatives who lean toward being pacifists, and conservatives who do not. \n \n The gay conservative Christians with whom I spoke said they believe in Biblical inerrancy, in pre-millennialism, in salvation by faith through grace. They regard the New Testament as superceding the Old Testament. They reject the idea that women should not be pastors. One of these conservative gay Christians is a passionate opponent of the war in Iraq. On the subject of homosexuality, both identify themselves as gay, which they said is not a sin, but they said they are choosing celibacy, for now anyway, because they think that God condemns same-sex relations. They draw this belief from their reading of both the Old and New Testaments. Both said they are struggling with this. One said that he hopes he will fall in love with a woman some day, but this has not happened so far, and he has had no sexual or romantic attractions to women. When questioned further, both of these gay conservative Christians talked about what a struggle celibacy has been for them, and both said they are not sure if this is the right path for them. Both said they are questioning the idea that same-sex relations are sinful, and one said that he is considering seeking out a different church that doesn't regard homosexal relations as sinful. But he said he struggles with this, because he fears he may not find a Christian church that accepts homosexuality that holds to the same Christian doctrine that he embraces. He fears that Christian churches that accept homosexuality may be too liberal for him on other theological questions. \n \n What became clear to me from listening to these two gay men was how much their churches' anti-gay positions caused them to question where they belong within Christianity. Neither one felt entirely comfortable with the idea of joining a more liberal Christian church. But neither one felt entirely comfortable within the churches they were in either. Both expressed a feeling of dissonance between who they are as people and what their churches espouse theologically about who they are. They expressed the feeling of not fitting in completely anywhere. \n \n Are their beliefs and experiences different from those of heterosexual conservative Christians? Certainly they are. These two gay men bring their experiences as gay men to their faith, and the dissonance they experience is not something that heterosexal conservative Christians experience, at least not in the same way. That dissonance influences the faith and the lives of both men.",

   "Slow down Batman. Jesus is supposed to have said something like, \"you've heard an eye for an eye, but I say turn the other cheek.\" How is that not speaking against the Old Testament?\n\n \n Maybe this will explain it for you jim. Remember that it's all about proper context, and the World usually distorts that part of the scriptures which changes the overall meaning of so many passages and truths. Jesus was not contradicting an eye for an eye at all which was meant for civil application for the community at large. In Jesus day it became a personal mantra to justify personal revenge which the original intent never implied at all. That is the difference.\n \n http://www.gac.20m.com/self-def.htm\n There seems to be a lot of confusion in Christian circles regarding our Lord's statement in Matthew 5:39: \"But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.\" (New King James Version. Emphasis mine). Many take this verse and claim that it is not right nor lawful for a Christian to defend himself or herself but rather one ought to be passive. At first appearance it seems that they may be right. This sure seems like Christ is teaching pacifism. Yet, is this really so?. \n \n Its the Context \n The context of this passage is the Sermon on the Mount where our Lord is teaching proper Christian conduct amidst an unbelieving world and hypocritical religious leaders. The scribes and the Pharisees were taking passages of Scripture in the Old Testament (that was all the Scriptures they had at the time) out of context That is why Christ constantly began His words with: \"You have heard that it was said...\". He was correcting the errors of their teaching and thinking. The scribes and Pharisees were famous for saying \"do and do not\" (Matt. 23:3).\n \n In the context of Matthew 5:38-39 (as well as Luke 6:29) our Lord is correcting yet another error by these religious leaders. In verse 38 He says: \"You have heard that it was said: 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth'.\" The religious leaders, the scribes and Pharisees, were taking what God had instructed in His law (Ex. 21:24; Deut. 19:21; Lev. 24:20) for the civil government and made it a private and individual matter. The Lord God had instructed the judges and magistrates to punish those who had done injuries by making them suffer the way they made their victims suffer. The scribes and Pharisees taught that this meant private or individual revenge. This was not correct. The individual has not been given the right for revenge. That is in the hands of God (see Deut. 32:35; Romans 12:19) and His \"means\" of punishment through the civil magistrates (Rom. 13:4). Christ challenges this contrary teaching by saying \"But I tell you...\"\n \n In verse 39 Christ now instructs them that it is the duty of every man to bear patiently the injuries that he receives (Calvin) and not to seek revenge. It is my conviction that the Lord is NOT referring to the matter of \"self defense\" in this context. He is NOT saying here that it is sinful for one to defend himself and/or his family when being threatened. If He were then this would be a contradiction to what Scripture says elsewhere (see below and also Pratt's article: \"What Does the Bible Say about Gun Control?\"). This is where I part with some conservative and Reformed commentators (such as Ridderbos) who imply that one must resist \"even defending himself\" . If they mean that in all instances this ought to be the case then they are wrong. Again, the Lord does not allow for \"revengence\" by the individual. However, defending himself or his family is certainly not forbidden.\n \n If this text is not speaking about self defense, what does the Lord mean when He says \"not to resist an evil person\" and then adds \"But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also\"? Admittedly this appears to be a pacifist text. H.N. Ridderbos does help us out in this area when he says:\n \n Jesus specifically mentions the right here , even though a blow from a right-handed person would normally fall on the left cheek. This probably means that the blow is delivered with the back of the hand, since then it would indeed fall on the right cheek. We know for certain that such a blow was considered particularly insulting. The injustice that is willingly accepted here is therefore not so much a matter of body injury as of shame. (H.N. Ridderbos. \"Matthew\": Bible Students Commentary. Zondervan. p. 113)\n At a closer look this passage deals with how one must respond after being insulted. This is not a passage dealing with what one must do when being physically attacked and having one's life being threatened. It is, however, one that reinforces the idea that \"revenge\" is not to be left in the hands of the individual victim. Personal revenge and even \"lynch-law\" is certainly out of the question. The Lord has already set up the means to deal with punishing the offender by the sword of the state. It is a passage that teaches one must have patience when wronged. As the great Reformer John Calvin says:\n When wrong has been done them (believers) in a single instance, he (Christ) wishes them to be trained by this example to meek submission, that by suffering they may learn to be patient. (John Calvin. \"Harmony of Matthew, Mark and Luke\" Calvin's Commentaries. Baker. p. 299)\n \n Do these passages forbid self-defense? They do not deal with it nor do they forbid it. Let us, then, turn the other cheek...and briefly look at some passages that do deal with self-defense. \n \n \n Its the Concept of Self-Defense \n As I wrote above our Lord would be contradicting Himself or Scripture by saying that one must never defend himself or his family in any circumstance. The Word of God does allow and encourage self-defense. In the Scriptures we do not find God encouraging His people to be either \"hawks\" or \"doves\" when dealing with self-defense. They are just to be reasonable.\n \n In the early part of redemptive history we see the patriarch Abraham mustering one of the first armed militias (without the approval of any state or federal government, I would note) to rescue his kidnapped nephew, Lot (Gen. 14:21ff). This was not revenge but was purely defending and protecting (here rescuing) a family member and retrieving property. This can be labeled as a biblical example of self-defense. It is interesting to note that later \"[t]he Israelite army was a militia army which came to battle with each man bearing his own weapons - from the time of Moses, through the Judges, and beyond.\" (Pratt; ibid.)\n \n In Exodus 20:13, part of the Ten Commandments, we read \"Thou shalt not kill\" (KJV). The accurate English translation would be \"You shall not murder\". This commandment does NOT forbid the taking of life under certain circumstances. A good interpretation what this commandment does mean (requires of us) is found in the Westminster Larger Catechism:\n \n What Are the Duties Required In the Sixth Commandment? \n Answer: The duties required in the sixth commandment are, all careful studies, and lawful endeavors, to preserve the life of ourselves and others by resisting all thoughts and purposes, subduing all passions, and avoiding, all occasions, temptations, and practices, which tend to the unjust taking away the life of any; by just defense thereof against violence, patient bearing of the hand of God, quietness of mind, cheerfulness of spirit; a sober use of meat, drink, physical, sleep, labour, and recreations; by charitable thoughts, love, compassion, meekness, gentleness, kindness; peaceable, mild and courteous speeches and behaviour; forbearance, readiness to be reconciled, patient bearing and forgiving of injuries, and requiting good for evil; comforting and succouring the distressed, and protecting and defending the innocent. (Q. &A. 135; emphasis added).\n Note that the Catechism says to \"preserve the life of ourselves and others by resisting...\" (emphasis added). The writers of this fine document understood the necessity, at times, to use defensive measures to aid others when necessary. They also say \"by just defense thereof against violence.\" This is a call for the legitimate use of self-defense. The Scriptures they use to defend (no pun intended) this statement are Ps. 82:4; Prov. 24:11-12; 1 Sam. 14:45.\n Another passage of Scripture in Exodus tells us that protecting your family and possessions by using physical force when an intruder enters your home at night is legitimate: \" If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him. If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.\" (Ex. 22:2-3). This passage simply means that one can defend his home and life and that of his family if a thief or intruder comes in at night and threatens them. If it is during the daylight hours and the situation is not life threatening then lethal force can NOT be used.\n \n In 1 Samuel 13:19,22 (see main page for the verses and a short comment) we see what happens when individuals of a nation no longer have the equipment to make and bear arms and defend themselves, their families and their nation. An open invitation to be attacked and plundered. Is this not, in reality, what the anti-self-defense people are setting us up for?\n \n In Nehemiah 4 we see that the Jews were instructed to defend themselves and the wall they were building from those who wanted to use any means to keep it from being built. \" They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon. For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.\" (Neh. 4:17,18; KJV).\n \n There are other Old Testament passages could be given but these ought to suffice. In the New Testament we have such passages as Luke 22:36, which says: \" Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it,and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one\". Our Lord encouraged His disciples to get protection for use in self-defense. Elsewhere in the NT we have Paul saying that one must take care of his own family (1 Tim. 5:18) and, as I said on the main page, this also implies defending them as well. The New Testament does not contradict the Old Testament instruction on self-defense by saying \"turn the other cheek\".\n \n Conclusion \n This short article is not meant to be the last answer on the issue nor do I expect to necessarily change the pacifists' minds. However I hope that I have shown that \"turning the other cheek\" does not forbid one to use self-defense when one's life and/or family is facing life threatening situations. Referring to the Matt. 5:38-39 passage to prove pacifism is misleading and wrong.\n \n I am thoroughly convinced that the Scriptures allow us to defend ourselves. That means that I have God-given rights to \"bear arms\"in order to do so. Only God can take away that right. I conclude with a quote from the late Dr. A. T. Robertson, a Greek language scholar, on the Matthew passage:\n \n Jesus protested when smitten on the cheek (John 18:22). And Jesus denounced the Pharisees (Matt 23) and fought the devil always. The language of Jesus is bold and picturesque and is not to be pressed too literally (he is speaking here of the passage in question, GC). Paradoxes startle and make us think. We are expected to fill in the other side of the picture....Aggressive or offensive war by nations is also condemned, but not necessarily defensive war or defense against robbery and murder. Professional pacifism may be mere cowardice. (A.T. Robertson. \"Word Pictures in the New Testament\", Vol. I, p. 48).\n ",

   "Maybe this will explain it for you jim. Remember that it's all about proper context, and the World usually distorts that part of the scriptures which changes the overall meaning of so many passages and truths.\n\n Do you have any clue when you start speaking like you're in a cult, determined to look at things through only Jesus glasses and incapable of independently questioning what you are spoon-fed?\n \n http://www.gac.20m.com/self-def.htmIf this text is not speaking about self defense, what does the Lord mean when He says \"not to resist an evil person\" and then adds \"But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also\"? Admittedly this appears to be a pacifist text. H.N. Ridderbos does help us out in this area when he says:\n \n Jesus specifically mentions the right here , even though a blow from a right-handed person would normally fall on the left cheek. This probably means that the blow is delivered with the back of the hand, since then it would indeed fall on the right cheek. We know for certain that such a blow was considered particularly insulting. The injustice that is willingly accepted here is therefore not so much a matter of body injury as of shame. (H.N. Ridderbos. \"Matthew\": Bible Students Commentary. Zondervan. p. 113)This ridiculous apologetic attempt is absurdity at its worst.\n It tries to CHANGE the meaning of the clearly defined bible passage to suit its own designs.\n \n The ACTUAL Bible passage goes on beyond what is quoted above...\n Luke 6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the [one] cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not [to take thy] coat also. \n Oh wait. THIS bible passage makes NO MENTION of which cheek, the right or the left, is struck. Whoops. Archie probably didn't want you to see that, huh... emoticon_xclown \n But going past that for the moment, it talks about giving the offender THE OTHER CHEEK to strike as well.\n \n Which, by the apologetic logic above, would indicate a FRONT of the hand strike. A bodily attack.\n Furthermore, the passage talks about THEFT, and not preventing the person from stealing, but offering MORE to take instead.\n \n Christian apologetics is amazing. Some people will go to all sorts of lengths to ignore the Biblical \"truth\" that is clearly stated, and insist that you have to stand on your head and drink a glass of their kool-aid to truly \"understand\" what is being said.",

   "No, not \"*homosexuality* is a sin\", but rather *sex between people of the same gender*. This is very clear in the scripture. There's no reasonable way to interpret it any differently short of simply ignoring what it says. This pretty much becomes a case of people wanting the Bible to say what they want it to say, and therefore pretending it's saying something different, calling it a different \"interpretation\". Pretending and interpreting are not the same thing, and the only way to make the Bible not indicate that a \"man shall not lay with a man\" is to literally pretend it doesn't say so. Interpretation still needs to be reasonable. There's reasonable interpretation, and there's interpretation to absurdity. We need to have reasonable interpretation, but taking a passage that says something so clearly as that and saying it doesn't mean what it says is like saying the commandment \"you shall not commit adultery\" doesn't really mean \"you shall not commit adultery\". Well, yeah, it probably simply means \"you shall not commit adultery.\" And \"a man shall not lay with a man\" in all likelihood means what it says too. IMO, it's a harder case to make in saying the Bible doesn't frown upon homosexual behavior (notice I said homosexual behavior--NOT 'homosexuality'), than to say that it does.\n\n \n It doesn't say man shall not lay with a man. It says man shall not lay with a man as a man lays with a woman. Gay men don't have sex like that, when acting on our homosexuality or our gay natures. You have really shown a false understanding of homosexual behaviour, when you say the Bible frowns on this. At it's basic fundamental nature, it's not men turning away from women to be with men. Gay men would not be with women to begin with, when we act directly from our gay natures.\n \n Temple prostitutes may act in such ways, and that is the context in which this is presented. It is up for interpretation. Nothing is being pretended. An enlightened knowledge of gay people and our nature is being drawn upon to interpret the verse. This is in opposition to the heterosexist myth, that views all sexuality in the misunderstanding that we are all as our basic sexual natures, heterosexual, and act from this. We are not all that way in reality.\n \n Yes, it's easier to take a few words out of context, then it is to really understand the whole topic in context. All you have said in your reply is that you are right, and we are wrong. Yes, that's easy too, and didn't require such an effort of that much typing. This is quite a close-minded, evasive, ideological approach you take here. It's your right to believe that way, however, it doesn't show the best understanding of the depth and breadth, the complexity, of sexuality and being gay/homosexuality/sexual orientation.",

   "Just out of curiosity, where do you find all these \"gay conservative Christians\"? Some interfaith group? Frankly, I don't think they stand much chance of finding a Christian church that can provide them with what they think they need. Maybe in a major metropolitan area where you can find just about anything, but I would say the combination must be exceedingly rare. Cognitive dissonance is often the beginning of a conversion experience which may take years to complete.\n \n They may have to start their own Christian variety. I think much of the problem for them is a lot of these mindsets do, in fact, go in common, maybe not for everyone, but for most folk. Scratch a conservative Christian, and polls suggest you will most likely find a reactionary harboring a lot of self-righteous prejudice against anything that isn't familiar.\n\n \n I spoke with only two conservative gay Christians, and so I cannot say they are representative of a wider group. I can only report what these two said. \n \n I am not sure, but I think the Metropolitan Community Churches, which have mostly gay members, are pretty theologically conservative. I also read this past fall about a predominantly gay mega-church in Texas that is evangelical, certainly. I'm not sure if the label conservative would fit them. \n \n One problem is that the term \"conservative\" is not at all specific, and it's hard to know just when to label a church \"conservative.\" African American churches tend to be theologically conservative but progressive on race and economic issues.",

   "I spoke with only two conservative gay Christians, and so I cannot say they are representative of a wider group. I can only report what these two said. \n \n I am not sure, but I think the Metropolitan Community Churches, which have mostly gay members, are pretty theologically conservative. I also read this past fall about a predominantly gay mega-church in Texas that is evangelical, certainly. I'm not sure if the label conservative would fit them. \n \n One problem is that the term \"conservative\" is not at all specific, and it's hard to know just when to label a church \"conservative.\" African American churches tend to be theologically conservative but progressive on race and economic issues.\n\n \n I agree the word \"conservative\" is pretty elastic when applied to religion -- think reform, conservative and orthodox Jews, each stricter in observance than the previous one. It's difficult to find specific labels for religious beliefs, because the mix varies considerably, and when taking individuals into account, few large faiths are really as monolithic as their clergy would like to project.\n \n Still, I think we have a general idea of what we mean by a conservative Christian: hidebound, inflexible, traditional, reactionary against any new idea. The conservatives of one era can have radically different ideas than the conservatives of another -- it all depends on what tradition they are concerned with protecting, and many \"traditions\" are fairly recent!\n \n There probably was a time in Christianity when homosexuality wasn't the explosive issue it has become today, thanks to Protestant fundamentalism. I also agree that scripture can be interpreted as flexibly as anyone pleases -- there is really no such thing as \"objectively canonical\" scripture. \"Canonical\" just means \"what the majority currently accepts and justifies as traditional\".\n \n Even religion is relativistic! :) Still, we have to deal with \"conservative Christianity\" as most Christians would define it today, while realising the definition is not perfect and has very fuzzy boundaries in reality. I do not think gay people can be conservative Christians in modern understanding. It's a hopeless task. They'll have to redefine \"conservative Christianity\" to suit themselves if they care for the label. After all, that's what every \"conservative Christian\" already does!",

In Matthew 5:17, Jesus said: \"Do not think I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them\".\n IOW, the moral Law; the Laws pertaining to morality and sin as set forth in both the Old and New Testaments, are still in effect. The Laws that were abolished were the ceremonial Laws.\n\n \n And when reactionary Christians are asked how they distinguish between the \"ceremonial\" OT law they find it convenient to disregard, and the \"moral\" OT law they find it convenient for others they hate to obey, all we hear is the sound of crickets chirping.",

But they don't have an organized movement to strip divorced people of their rights the way some Christian conservatives have a movement to deny gay people our rights. There was briefly a movement to create a parallel kind of marriage in some states, \"covenant marriage,\" which would restrict married couples' ability to divorce. Very few people opted for this kind of marriage, and the movement seems to have died out.\n \n Most Christians, conservative and liberal, seem to have accepted divorce, even though Jesus himself condemned it. Even the Catholic Church, while not calling it divorce, allows annulments. Most Christians don't take the kind of rigid \"it's a sin\" position on divorce that many take on same-sex marriage.

   "Even if they're in the closet???\n\n \n Can conservative Christians be gay? I guess a lot depends on semantic definitions. To me, \"gay\" is not strictly a homonym to \"homosexual\" -- it carries cultural connotations as well. To be \"gay\" means (to me) to have some sense of liberation in identifying oneself as \"gay\", as opposed to something else. Some people who behave homosexually nevertheless do not self-identify as \"gay\". I think that to be \"gay\" in the full sense of the word means having a degree of self-acceptance that in this case appears to me to be excluded by what I understand as \"conservative Christianity\", which rejects homosexuality as \"sinful\". Hence you cannot be gay and a conservative Christian in good standing with one's church. It's not that being celibate makes one something other than gay, it's one's attitude towards gay relationships in general. People in closets can be gay; so can celibates; but not, I think, practicing conservative Christians -- in my semantic perspective.\n \n If, on the other hand, you prefer other definitions, then you could make an alternative argument that conservative Christianity is compatible with acceptance of being gay -- where being gay is not restricted to merely experiencing feelings of homosexual desire.",
