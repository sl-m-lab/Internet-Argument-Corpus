   "All GOP senators join Hatch-Lee budget push | The Salt Lake Tribune\n \n \nWashington >> All 47 Republican senators back an effort by Utah Sens. Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee to amend the Constitution to require Congress to balance its annual budgets, and the group expects to win enough Democratic support to pass the measure.\n \n \"We will have a vote on this,\" Hatch said Thursday at a news conference in the Capitol standing shoulder to shoulder with about 20 colleagues. \n\n \n \nThe amendment would cap annual federal spending at 18 percent of the gross domestic product but allow exceptions if Congress declares war or the nation faces an imminent security threat.\n \n Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, singled out Hatch for leading the charge on the amendment. Other senators noted that if Hatch's attempt in 1997 to pass such a measure had not fallen short by one vote, the country would be in a better shape financially today.\n \n Lee, a freshman who has made the amendment a top goal, said constitutionally requiring Congress to balance the budget is the only way to stop the \"perpetual, reckless runaway spending.\"\n\n \n ROTFLMAO. These are the same guys who have insisted that we limit budget cuts to non defense discretionary spending. \n \n And, for the record, that is NOT a balanced budget amendment. That is a federal spending cap. If they are going to have a balanced budget amendment they need to cap expenditures AND say they must be fully funded in the current year.",

   "You'd need to get 1960s tax levels in order to \"balance\" the budget since that was the last time government revenue was around 18% (I mean those tax rates until they were changed to the lowest level in 2002). \n \n Even so, not a bad step. I'm just worried about what \"security threat\" is going to mean. Below is Virginia's \"balanced budget amendment\"\n Section 7. Collection and disposition of State revenues.\n \n All taxes, licenses, and other revenues of the Commonwealth shall be collected by its proper officers and paid into the State treasury. No money shall be paid out of the State treasury except in pursuance of appropriations made by law; and no such appropriation shall be made which is payable more than two years and six months after the end of the session of the General Assembly at which the law is enacted authorizing the same.\n \n Other than as may be provided for in the debt provisions of this Constitution, the Governor, subject to such criteria as may be established by the General Assembly, shall ensure that no expenses of the Commonwealth be incurred which exceed total revenues on hand and anticipated during a period not to exceed the two years and six months period established by this section of the Constitution.\n \n The amendment ratified November 6, 1984 and effective July 1, 1986-Added the second paragraph. \n\n Seems fairly straight forward. \n \n We should only have a provision for declared war and allowance of a budget deficit not to exceed 2 years and cannot be done again until that is paid off.",

On the other side of the isle, you have democrats who literally called $60 billion in cuts \"draconian\" supporting this move. \n \n Do they not realize the massive cuts that would be required to put this in place???",
