   "It seems the Senator may be continuing to surround herself cronies of corruption. No wonder she doesn't want to talk about it.\n \n \n \n \n http://www.nysun.com/article/29226?page_no=3\n \n Questions Surround Activities of Clinton Donor\n BY MEGHAN CLYNE - Staff Reporter of the Sun\n March 16, 2006\n URL: http://www.nysun.com/article/29226\n WASHINGTON - Senator Clinton's likely Republican opponent in 2006 and a South Korean newspaper are raising questions about campaign donations the New York Democrat has received from a New York businessman who is involved in an organization that sets up cultural events in North Korea.\n The organization was founded by a man who later resigned as South Korea's ambassador to America after allegations emerged that he helped establish a \"slush fund\" for South Korean politicians.\n \"Once again serious questions surround Senator Clinton's fund-raising operation,\" the Republican challenger in Mrs. Clinton's Senate re-election bid, a former mayor of Yonkers, John Spencer, said about the donations. \"We know that federal charges were levied against her fund-raisers from her last campaign and that she has taken money linked to supporters of Iranian mullahs. Now another issue pops up. Senator Clinton needs to come clean and answer these latest questions.\"\n A request for comment from Mrs. Clinton's Senate office was referred to her campaign spokesman, Sam Arora, who did not return repeated phone call and e-mail requests for comment Monday, Tuesday, and yesterday.\n The contributions in question come from a New York-based real estate investor, Hyung Young \"Daniel\" Lee. According to records on file with the Federal Election Commission, Mr. Lee, 44, donated $4,100 to Mrs. Clinton's 2006 Senate re-election campaign through Friends of Hillary in May 2005. His wife, Eva, donated $5,100 in four separate contributions between August 2004 and May 2005. FEC documents show that the Clinton campaign refunded Mrs. Lee $1,000; FEC regulations cap donations to a candidate at $4,200 for an individual contributor during an election cycle.",

You're delusional to think all you've said here is factual. Jim's Trucking still believes there were WMD immediately prior to invasion and that they were moved to Syria and other parts unknown with the help of the Russians. The fact that we will never find them makes your ridiculous claim of proof that they never existed seem just the slightest bit plausible. (BTW, if I succeed only at one thing on the site, I'm hoping it's that I teach you how to spell ridiculous so you won't look so.)\n \n While you may have a shortlist of Bush's activities that support the items I bulleted in the quote above, the conclusions are unfounded.\n \n\n \u00b7 Bushes economic policies are a disaster, \n\n \n Our economy is not that bad today. Bush's economic policy regarding taxes has seen to that. He is overspending, but has also been strapped with unexpected needs for money to be spent. He has grown the deficit, but he doesn't control the price of gasoline or the interest rates, or the stock market. It's just unfortunate that when things take a turn for the worse, people blame the President for things he doesn't really control.\n \n\n \u00b7 his social policies are a disaster, \n\n \n Please be particular and list what you think are his failed social policies. A mere claim of disaster means nothing to me.\n \n \n\n \u00b7 his foreign policies are just plain laughable,\n\n \n Again, tell me the funny ones. I think he's trying to be diplomatic in an extremely tense time. Standing up for what's right is always controversial and inviting of flak from ideological opposites...especially when a stance for peace and freedom must be accompanied by military might. I do favor closing our porous borders and acting like we consider ourselves a separate country from Mexico. I think Bush (and others before him) have neglected that border for too long.\n \n Adjustments to a worldwide economy sometimes make Presidents look bad even though they had no control of the market. Jobs are going to go to countries with a qualified, least cost work force no matter what else happens. The prediction of the giant sucking sound in Mexico has come true. India is likely next. On the other hand, some foreign manufacturer's are now building plants in the US.\n \n\n \u00b7 and the neoconservative motion as a whole has been exposed as little more than the deranged ranting of lunatics.\n\n \n Again, just your opinion. There are likely more people who consider the left to be deranged than you'd care to mention. Liberalism is a mental disorder.\n \n \n\n Even Mw F Buckley, a neocon saint if ever there was one, has said \"One can't doubt that the American objective in Iraq has failed.\" There so seem to be some at the National Review (the paper Buckley founded) that doubt it, but even they are starting to back off on their rediculous rhetoric.\nWhile the \"Mission Accomplished\" banner was a premature, the American objective having failed is a not a valid claim unless you can define the objectives in such a way as to exclude what is happening, albeit slowly in Iraq today. Democratic government is emerging from the rubble. \n \n\n Even Jimstrucking seems to have lost the appetite for looking like an idiot by defending the invasion of Iraq or insisting that there WERE WMDs when the entire planet recognizes that there were none.\nI repeat. The weapons were there. The weapons were moved. You will not be able to prove otherwise just because they haven't been found. You can claim to know that they were never there, but you will have absolutely no logical backing for your ridiculous, self imposed blindness. All you have is hindsight and lack of evidence.\n \n Invading Afghanistan and Iraq have not been mistakes. Papers being released after declassification are showing more and more the connections between terrorism and these rogue governments, all of which need to be wiped from the earth. I'm afraid we're not through yet and that many more thousands of people (innocent and terrorist) will die before the resolution of this conflict.\n \n I am not one to sit idly by hoping that the terrorists will not strike again. I KNOW they will...unless we manage to capture or kill them first. That has been my unwavering drive since 9-11. It's not that the previous deadly terrorist attacks on our interests have been insignificant. It's just that 9-11 was so huge and so cruel that it lit a fire in my gut against terrorism and terrorists. I've long hated people who harm others for no reason other than the thrill of sadism or their own political gain. I hate child molesters, rapists, murderers, terrorists and anyone who supports them. KILL THEM ALL! THE WORLD WILL BE A MUCH BETTER PLACE WHEN THEY ARE ALL DEAD!\n \n I'm not certain that anyone could have done a better job of running this country for the past few years. I know it could have been worse. It may have been better. No President in my memory bank has ever done everything I wanted him to do.",
