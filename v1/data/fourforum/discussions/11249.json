I was under the impression that Nuclear weapons can potentially kill more people than bullets, but I guess not.\n\n \n A single nuclear weapon vs a single bullet, sure, but over the course of history bullets have killed many more people. This is mostly because they are relatively precise and easy to make or acquire. Nuclear weapons are not. The idea that terrorists could easily get a nuclear device, transport it and detonate it, and that even if they could it would make any difference who was in the White House, is a preposterous one. Dirty bombs are more likely, but they are a relatively minor threat unless thousands are procured. The only real effect is that which people give them through fear.\n \n In any case, the real target of negotiation is not the likes of Osama bin Laden, it's those who might be inclined to support him. Bin Laden has plenty of supporters who are not radicals, much as the IRA had a lot of support among Irish Americans. The target of any negotiation will be opinion on the arab street, which will deprive radical groups of moral and logistical support, and of the conveyor of willing martyrs resulting from US and US-backed policy in the middle east.",

Files and records have been found in Iraq that proved that saddams fallen regime DID participate in not only training the 9/11 attackers using a grounded passenger Jet for rehearsals, but also harbored and financed them after helping to plan the attack. And also celebrated the success of the attack by calling for the celebrations in the streets throughout Iraq after announcing the successful completion of the operation.\n The fact is, Iraq shelters known, wanted terrorists, allows terrorist groups to maintain offices within its borders and operates a terrorist training camp at Salman Pak, complete with the fuselage of an airliner for practicing hijacking.\n \n According to the State Department, among the terrorist groups that continue to maintain offices in Baghdad are the Arab Liberation Front, Abu Abbas' Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), and, at least until the recent suicide (?) of its leader, the Abu Nidal Organization.\n \n It has also been reported that members of the Jihadist Palestinian terror group Hamas trained at Salman Pak and that Saddam has paid large sums of money to surviving family members of suicide bombers.\n \n One indisputable terror crime that Iraq was involved in was the attempted assassination in 1993 of former President George H. W. Bush during his visit to Kuwait. In fact, President Bill Clinton ordered a cruise missile strike in retaliation for that failed plot, which was put together by Iraqi intelligence.\n \n In the past few years, two independent investigators have uncovered evidence that would seem to indicate Iraqi involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.\n \n Dr. Laurie Mylroie published a book entitled \"Revenge: Saddam Hussein's Unfinished War Against America.\" That book details evidence of Iraqi involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The book has been updated and republished as \"The War Against America: Saddam Hussein and the World Trade Center Attacks.\" William F. Buckley, Jr. said that Mylroie's book \"reports persuasively that Saddam Hussein was the sponsor of the 1993 attempt on the World Trade Center.\" Lest you believe that Mylroie is just an arch-conservative ideologue writing in support of the Bush administration, you may want to know that this book was published in 2000, before George W. Bush was even elected. Furthermore, Mylroie is a former adviser to none other than Bill Clinton. Most importantly, however, in her book, Dr. Mylroie reveals that Jim Fox, the director of the New York FBI at the time of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, concluded that Iraq was behind the bombing. Moreover, one of the suspects still wanted in the 1993 World Trade Center attack, Abdul Yasin, is known to have fled the country and is now in Baghdad. That fact alone puts Iraq in violation of UNSCR 687.http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2003/guest_holton_2_06.html",

   "NONSENSE!!\n \n That's the time when the Shrub and his cabal totally humiliated the best man to serve during his entire malAdminstration, Gen. Colin Powell.\n \n How it must have pained that good man to stand before the United Nations and speak what he knew were lies about Saddam Hussein's \"mobile\" WMD's.\n\n \n \nHow about you produce one link that proves that Powell PURPOSELY AND KNOWINGLY LIED WHEN HE SPOKE TO THE UN OF SADDAMS WMD PROGRAM. I know he didn't lie and he believed everything he said was factual as did the leaders of every coalition nation involved with the operation. Ours wasn't the only intelligence agency that had the same info on his programs.\n \n That's why even the complete democratic arm of our legislature save I think 4 members voted to support the War. You guys love to forget that little diddy.\n\n \n \nTry this, rightie:\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/08/19/powell.un/\n\n \n Thanks for proving you're all wet chester. No where does \"your\" link say that Powell KNOWINGLY LIED TO THE UN ABOUT ANYTHING HE SAID THAT DAY! Here's the article:\n Former aide: Powell WMD speech 'lowest point in my life'\n \n (CNN) -- A former top aide to Colin Powell says his involvement in the former secretary of state's presentation to the United Nations on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction was \"the lowest point\" in his life.\n \n \"I wish I had not been involved in it,\" says Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, a longtime Powell adviser who served as his chief of staff from 2002 through 2005. \"I look back on it, and I still say it was the lowest point in my life.\"\n \n Wilkerson is one of several insiders interviewed for the CNN Presents documentary \"Dead Wrong -- Inside an Intelligence Meltdown.\" The program pieced together the events leading up to the mistaken WMD intelligence that was presented to the public. A presidential commission that investigated the pre-war WMD intelligence found much of it to be \"dead wrong.\"\n \n Powell's speech, delivered on February 5, 2003, made the case for the war by presenting U.S. intelligence that purported to prove that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Wilkerson says the information in Powell's presentation initially came from a document he described as \"sort of a Chinese menu\" that was provided by the White House.\n \n \"(Powell) came through the door ... and he had in his hands a sheaf of papers, and he said, 'This is what I've got to present at the United Nations according to the White House, and you need to look at it,'\" Wilkerson says in the program. \"It was anything but an intelligence document. It was, as some people characterized it later, sort of a Chinese menu from which you could pick and choose.\"\n \n Wilkerson and Powell spent four days and nights in a CIA conference room with then-Director George Tenet and other top officials trying to ensure the accuracy of the presentation, Wilkerson says.\n \n \"There was no way the Secretary of State was going to read off a script about serious matters of intelligence that could lead to war when the script was basically un-sourced,\" Wilkerson says.\n \n In one dramatic accusation in his speech, Powell showed slides alleging that Saddam had bioweapons labs mounted on trucks that would be almost impossible to find.\n \n \"In fact, Secretary Powell was not told that one of the sources he was given as a source of this information had indeed been flagged by the Defense Intelligence Agency as a liar, a fabricator,\" says David Kay, who served as the CIA's chief weapons inspector in Iraq after the fall of Saddam. That source, an Iraqi defector who had never been debriefed by the CIA, was known within the intelligence community as \"Curveball.\"\n \n After searching Iraq for several months across the summer of 2003, Kay began e-mailing Tenet to tell him the WMD evidence was falling apart. At one point, Wilkerson says, Tenet called Powell to tell him the claims about mobile bioweapons labs were apparently not true.\n \n \"George actually did call the Secretary, and said, 'I'm really sorry to have to tell you. We don't believe there were any mobile labs for making biological weapons,'\" Wilkerson says in the documentary. \"This was the third or fourth telephone call. And I think it's fair to say the Secretary and Mr. Tenet, at that point, ceased being close. I mean, you can be sincere and you can be honest and you can believe what you're telling the Secretary. But three or four times on substantive issues like that? It's difficult to maintain any warm feelings.\"\n \n Find this article at: \n http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/08/19/powell.un",

Eliminate the distinction between earned and unearned income and tax all at the earned income rate.\n \n 3. Place a 45% inheritance tax on estates greater than $5M, and a 55% tax on those over $10M.\n \n 4. Remove the current earnings ceiling on FICA taxes - make all earnings subject to the tax.\n \n 5. End the oil depletion allowance.\n \n 6. Eliminate offshore tax havens.\n \n 7. Vigorous IRS investigation and enforcement of taxpayers with an income over $2M per annum.\n \n 8.

   "What was he refering to when he said this? You people really love to twist quotes to make them more convienent for you.\n\n \n It's from JFK's very famous Inaugural Address delivered 20 January 1961 - you know the one where he also said, \"ask not what your country can do for you...\". It largely addressed foreign policy: \n \n \"Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.\n \n We dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.\n \n But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course -- both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war.\n \n So let us begin anew -- remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.\n \n Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.\n \n Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms, and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations.\n \n Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce.\n \n Let both sides unite to heed, in all corners of the earth, the command of Isaiah -- to \"undo the heavy burdens, and [to] let the oppressed go free.\"\u00b9\n \n And, if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor -- not a new balance of power, but a new world of law -- where the strong are just, and the weak secure, and the peace preserved.\" http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkinaugural.htm",

   "Actually, it is. Haven't you heard that Chavez has recently Nationalized the Oil Industry? That means the Government has taken over control of previously privately owned Corporations. Some of them multi-nationals like the American Oil Companies that did business there, but no longer do because of his DICTATORIAL POLICIES. \n \n \n \n Prior to Castros Cuba, Havana was one of the great International vacation destination spots for gambling and tourism in this hemisphere. Since then, it has become a ghetto. Are you aware that before the fall of the USSR, it spent more money per month supporting Cuba than any other satellite Country under its oppressive umbrella of communist control? And let's face it, none of them were flourishing with economic success at all.\n\n \n Nationalisation has a democratic mandate. In the middle of the 20th century Britain nationalised coal, steel, car making, railways and many others, all under democratically elected governments. The people of a country wanting their natural resources to be used to benefit that country is not dictatorial.\n \n Economic growth is not everything, everyone in Cuba has food, education, healthcare. Which is far more than they did under Batista, and far more than similar countries which went capitalist. As for Cuba's economy, you try building any sort of functionning economy when your closest neighbour refuses to trade with you and intimidates others into doing the same.\n \n As for what I know about Venezuela, a fair amount. Not first hand, to be sure, but I know a few people who have visited, I've read a variety of reports from there, including pro-capitalist ones like the BBC. Mostly what I've discovered is that US news coverage of the country is a joke.",
