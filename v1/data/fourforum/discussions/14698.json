   " How Is Being Gay Like Gluing Wings on a Pig? JohnShore.com\n Excerpt:\nNo one tells the chronic drinker, or glutton, or adulterer, or any other kind of sinner, to stop experiencing love. Yet that's exactly what so many Christians are insisting gay people do.\n \n When you tell a gay person to \"resist\" being gay, what you are really telling them-what you really mean-is for them to be celibate.\n \n What you are truly and actually saying is that you want them to condemn themselves to a life devoid of love.\n \n Be alone, you're demanding. Live alone. Don't hold anyone's hand. Don't snuggle on your couch with anyone. Don't cuddle up with anyone at night before you fall asleep. Don't have anyone to chat with over coffee in the morning.\n \n Do not bind your life to that of another. Live your whole life without knowing that joy, that sharing, that peace.\n \n Just say \"no\" to love.\n \n Be alone. Live alone. Die alone.\n \n The \"sinful temptation\" that Christians are forever urging LGBT people to resist is love.\n \n Being, of course, the one thing Jesus was most clear about wanting his followers to extend to others.\n \n Can we stop with this cruel idiocy already?\n",

I have known I have been gay since as long as I can remember way back in early elementary school. \n I have never been abused sexually or otherwise. My parents have both been equal in their parenting of me and just recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. \n In every relationship I have had sex was at the bottom of my list of desires. At the top were love, communication, honesty, friendship (you gotta be friends if your going to be partners in love). There are others but sex is definitely not at the top of my priorities in my relationships although I have always had a health sex life, just not a priority in my relationships. My current relationship is now in its 15th year. Our sex life is just about the same as any other \"old married couple\". We are starting a family this year with a twin boy and girl. Our lives and our relationship are really no different than most heterosexual couples, except our relationship has lasted longer than then average heterosexual relationship. We will marry once marriage is the law of the land in all 50 states which is the inevitable and the right thing to do I might add. \n So, my point is that you can not paint all gay relationships and come to such conclusions based on your sampling of the gay community. Which, If I had to guess are probably young, immature, bar-hopping people looking for fun. Just like the majority of young straight individuals. It all depends on the people you choose to associate with. I would find more mature friends, your view is very skewed.",

   "Do the 'reputable' psychologists know exactly where the source of 'gayness' comes from?\n Is it in the childs DNA?\n 'Reputable' psychologists used to insist a child was a 'blank page' and all of its behaviour was learned , including assuming a gender role and gender behaviour( playing with dolls or playing rough).\n Where all those pyschologists ' unreputable?\n Your definition of a ' reputable' psychologist is one that agrees with you.\n \n If a homosexual( and hetero) is not genetically programme to be attracted to the same( or opposite sex) sex how does this happen and if they are has the gay( or hetero) gene been isolated..does any reputable psychologist know are are they just expediantly following the pc line?\n \n Educate me\n\n \n i think i can answer this. the cause of homosexuality is unknown, from my knowledge. the stats are all messed up because some people repress their sexuality and stay in the closet for their whole lives, so a typical genetic test would not work. it would cost thousands of dollars to get a sequence done of your genome, and in order to find out if there is a gay gene, it may cost millions of dollars for one family. add the cost to the difficulty in finding the specific gene amongst billions of alleles - add that to not knowing what to look for; it would cost another millions/billions of dollars of sequencing gay people to find the allele... it would be very very complicated.\n \n my opinion - i dont think homosexuality is genetic. i think its far more plausible that homosexuality is acquired during baby/toddler times. typically, attitudes or lifestyles, those kind of things are not contained in the genome, your genetics give you the physical tools to make your own attitudes or lifestyles. just going off of what is known, metaphysical stuff like attitude or lifestyle is gained during infanthood or childhood. but you never know, there could be a gay gene, it would be interesting to find out, but its not really worth the cost, in my opinion.",

   "From a 2006 \"60 Minutes\" (The Science Of Sexual Orientation - 60 Minutes - CBS News\nThe bedrooms of 9-year-old twins Adam and Jared couldn't be more different. Jared's room is decked out with camouflage, airplanes, and military toys, while Adam's room sports a pastel canopy, stuffed animals, and white horses.\n \n When Stahl came for a visit, Jared was eager to show her his G.I. Joe collection. \"I have ones that say like Marine and SWAT. And then that's where I keep all the guns for 'em,\" he explained.\n \n Adam was also proud to show off his toys. \"This is one of my dolls. Bratz baby,\" he said.\n \n Adam wears pinkish-purple nail polish, adorned with stars and diamonds.\n \n Asked if he went to school like that, Adam says, \"Uh-huh. I just showed them my nails, and they were like, 'Why did you do that?'\"\n \n Adam's behavior is called childhood gender nonconformity, meaning a child whose interests and behaviors are more typical of the opposite sex. Research shows that kids with extreme gender nonconformity usually grow up to be gay.\n \n Danielle, Adam and Jared's mom, says she began to notice this difference in Adam when he was about 18 months old and began asking for a Barbie doll. Jared, meanwhile, was asking for fire trucks.\n \n Not that much has changed. Jared's favorite game now is Battlefield 2, Special Forces. As for Adam, he says, \"It's called Neopets: The Darkest Faerie.\"\n \n Asked how he would describe himself to a stranger, Jared says, \"I'm a kid who likes G.I. Joes and games and TV.\"\n \n \"I would say like a girl,\" Adam replied to the same question. When asked why he thinks that is, Adam shrugged.\n \n \"To me, cases like that really scream out, 'Hey, it's not out there. It's in here.' There's no indication that this mother is prone to raise very feminine boys because his twin is not that way,\" says Michael Bailey, a psychology professor at Northwestern University and a leading researcher in the field of sexual orientation.\n \n Bailey says he doesn't think nurture is a plausible explanation.\n \n Psychologists used to believe homosexuality was caused by nurture - namely overbearing mothers and distant fathers - but that theory has been disproved. Today, scientists are looking at genes, environment, brain structure and hormones. There is one area of consensus: that homosexuality involves more than just sexual behavior; it's physiological.\n \nWatch it here: Gay Or Straight? - 60 Minutes - CBS News",

He is into guns and chicks, I on the other hand am gay, I am into shopping and men. I do not like being labeled as turning that way because of some traumatic even with a female. Because although I was with one female just to try it out, and I did not like it does not mean it was traumatic. My brother would not talk to me for months after I told him I was gay. So if anything being gay has been slightly traumatic.\n \n I also do not like how society labels gays as feminine, and wearing skinny jeans, make up, and tight clothes. Because not all of us do. I don't wear skinny jeans, I only wear make-up on sets of plays at school, and I do not wear tight clothes. And I am far from feminine, yes I like shopping and the color pink. But I play sports like Track and Field and football. I am also outstanding in JROTC I am on Drill Team and Color Guard in JROTC. I am good at them too.\n \n \n If you saw me on the street in my cargo jeans, Carolina Tar Heels t-shirt, crocs or shoes, and my high and tight haircut, you would never suspect I was gay. But if you followed me around for a day you might suspect I am, then if you followed me for more that two days you would know I was gay. I just hate being thrown in with the stereotypes. \n \n That is like me saying all straights are anti-gay, or all females need to stay home and do the dishes. It is just socially unjust for people to classify gays as people who go around touching their own sex in the privates. I also hate when gays do that XXXX in parades because it is setting a bad example to everyone watching.",
