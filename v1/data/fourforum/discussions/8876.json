I would suggest you ask yourself this: If you don't believe that arguments and proofs and reasons for believing in Christianity are strong enough to survive a little bit of discussion then why are they strong enough for you to believe in them? I mean, if you don't even have any faith in your ability to convince a group of people who are excited about having a discussion with you (skeptical or not), then how convinced could you really be yourself? Do you believe in it because you really think its true, or do you have some other motivation? Maybe its just what you are used to, how you were raised, or just want you are a part of socially, or are you afraid perhaps?

If Jesus of Nazareth existed, it is unlikely that he would recognise the teachings and practices of modern-day christian churches as having anything to do with him.\n So, there's my two-penn'orth. Anyone disagree?\n\n \n I do. This is all pretty well-known liberal revisionism, all of which is based on no more reliable evidence than traditional Christian belief that Jesus was indeed a real person. The revisionism you're peddling is all based on speculative evidence. For instance, the fact that there are similar elements in earlier or near-contemporary religions does not mean there is a causal relationship. It also makes the double standard mistake of not allowing the very text of the religion itself as having any historical value whatsoever, which is absolutely unreasonable. You say we know little about the figurehead, but in fact there are 4 very early books written about him, and any other topic than Christianity would allow for those accounts to be evidence he existed, sans the miracles perhaps. The very fact this double standard exists indicates an unreasonable prejudice toward Christianity.\n \n I DO agree that the conversion of Constantine was key toward Christianity becoming the religion is has become over the centuries, but only to the extent that it would have eventually done so anyway, simply because it was growing. Eventually it would have become a state religion regardless--Constantine became a convert BECAUSE it was a growing religion. And a lot of people believe he did it as a political move to appeal to the masses, knowing the inherent appeal of Christianity that was already there.\n \n I don't agree that the maleability of Christianity is a reason for it's growth--in fact, that maleability has been it's detriment at times. The Church changed TOO much and had become TOO bending to culture and politics, (becoming intwined with kings and governments) resulting in the protestant reformation returning the church to a belief system more like it was originally. It's most sustantial growth has taken place AFTER that, so I content that it's best growth has been when it has stayed true to its original principles.",
