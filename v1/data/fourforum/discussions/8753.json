   "At first sight, the Theory of Evolution is an elegant theory. Not only that, but it's got the benefit of some of the world's greatest minds working on and devising ways to keep it afloat so that the vast majority of the population can continue to be snow-blinded. The problem is, however, that everything about this theory crumbles when it is realized that the biological mechanism of random mutations is a complete and utter fairytale.\n \n According to Toe the population is supposedly the receiver of information. And this can only happen through random mutations. (This is why the theory MUST require gradualism)\n \n If one ever investigates evolution he'll find that mutations are the least talked-about aspect of the theory. Evolutionists LOVE talking about old bones and smelling, rotting carcasses, but when it comes to the mechanics of their theory, they often resort to little more than hand-waving....and this is because they cannot offer even one example of a random mutation that adds beneficial information to the genome. (when there should be a gazillion scientifically tested and proven examples) Instead, they rattle on for pages about mutations that are deleterious....or they'll go on and on about how a mutation can lead to a leg sticking out of the head of a fly or how mutations can cause disease. But what does any of this have to do with evolution? The fact is, they have not even one example of a random mutation that adds beneficial information to the genome. And they certainly do not have an example of a mutation that can lead to cumulative selection - the bedrock of their whole theory.\n \n Not even one (random) mutation has been observed that adds a little information to the genome. That surely shows that there are not the millions upon millions of potential mutations the theory demands. There may well not be any. The failure to observe even one mutation that adds information is more than just a failure to find support for the theory. It is evidence against the theory. Spetner\n \n So right off the bat we're expected to have blind faith in a miracle that's never been seen, proven, tested - or even witnessed. But that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n \n (Due to the body's proofreading mechanism)...The rarity of copying errors is a problem for Toe. The average rate of copying errors depends on the organism. In bacteria the mutation rate per nucleotide is between 0.1 and 10 per billion transcriptions...But in all other forms of life the rate is smaller. For organisms other than bacteria, the mutation rate is between 0.01 and 1 per billion (Grosse et al. 1984). Spetner\n \n So how does a theory explain rapid biological changes in a population when it has a mutation of rate of possibly 0.01 per billion? And who's to say that one small nucleotide will make any difference what-so-ever in an animal's ability to breed? The fact is, the effect would be invisible and would not have any effect at all on the animal's performance.\n \n Also, when natural selection selects for or against an individual within the population, it has to accept or reject the genome as a whole, which includes almost 6 billion nucleotides. NS, in fact never sees, nor acts on individual nucleotides. Nucleotides, in fact, have very little effect on the organism, yet that's how evolutionists believe that organisms build up over time...one nucleotide at a time. But this is just a wild (and wrong) assumption, as seen here:\n \n We now know that human nucleotides exist in large linked clusters or blocks, ranging in size from 10,000 to a million. These linkage blocks are inherited as a single unit, and never break apart. This totally negates one of the most fundamental assumptions of the theorists - that each nucleotide can be viewed as an individually selectable unit. Dr. J.C. Sanford (geneticist) (Of course this annihilates the whole theory as well.)\n \n And as I have stated before, evolutionists are afraid of testing animals. They're afraid to test to see if individual animals quickly change phenotypes as a result of an environmental change. (I challenge anyone to prove me wrong with a link.) And the reason for this is they do not accept the notion that the environment can cause a mutation. Thus, they simply chicken out when it comes to any testing that would falsify their theory. However, what they DO do, is resort to confusing people by playing around with bacteria and other assorted organisms in the lab. They figure the majority of the population won't bother to investigate the legitimacy of the claims that bacterial resistance proves evolution. They assume people will just take geneticists' and chemists' word for it.\n \n The fact is, however, that bacterial resistance is just as much a non-random phenomenon as an animal changing its color due to an environmental shift. There is simply no other explanation as to why science is so obsessed on laboratory experiments, yet completely and totally neglects similar experiments on real animals. It's so glaringly obvious, and in my opinion, it's an embarrassment for the scientific establishment. This alone speaks volumes because it proves they are hiding something.\n \n But in regards to bacteria:\n \n If we look into these experiments in detail (bacteria restance, et al.) we see that no new information got into the genome. Indeed, it turns out that each of those mutations actually lost information. They made the gene less specific. Therefore, none of them can play the role of small steps that are supposed to lead to macroevolution. Spetner\n \n Were it not for its defenses (proofreading mechanisms) mutations would in no time destroy all genetic texts. The effect (of mutations) is in all circumstances is to demolish. To rely on a rare, fortunate mistake is a poor resource, quite apart from the fact that transgressions of the kind needed by Darwinian evolution have never been documented. Sermonti\n \n Yet I am still not convinced there is a single, crystal-clear example of a known mutation which unambiguously created information. There are certainly examples of mutations which have been described as \"beneficial\", but most of these beneficial mutations have not created information, but rather have destroyed it. Sanford\n \n \"but but but but but....what about the nylon bug????\" - The fact is, this may or may not be adding information (it is still up in the air at this point)....but the problem for evolutionists is, like bacterial resistance, it is still a NON-RANDOM mutation...and the only reason the mutation occurred is because the organism was physically put in the presence of an outside influence; ie...the environment induced the mutation. It's no different -- in theory -- than putting a fish in a different environment and watching it change colors...\n \n http://www.mpks.org/faq/ans128.shtml\n \n The resistant bacterium has not evolved - in fact it has digressed genetically and is defective. Such a mutant strain is rapidly replaced by \"superior\" (i.e. natural) bacteria as soon as the antibiotic is removed. Another example would be the hairless Chihuahua dog. In extreme heat, reduction of size and loss of hair may be useful adaptation, but this involves degeneration. Sanford\n \n And this is more important than it may seem. The fact is, it's not just bacteria - but all of life is in a state of constant degeneration via mutations. \n \n ...Our species is dying. The theory of Evolution is wrong. Information decays. Genomes decay. Life is not going up up up - it is going down down down. Selection does not create information, and at best can only slow its progress. Sanford\n \n Even one of evolutionists' favorite examples for \"deliberate\" mutations, radiation, has a negative, degenerating effect on the crops it effected. Thus, once again, how could this possibly serve a vital role in evolution???? - which leads me to wonder why would they even bother talking about it in all their literature??? Deception? Are they that starved for emamples? :\n \n A huge number of small, sterile, sick, deformed, aberrant plants were produced. However, from all this effort, almost no meaningful crop improvement resulted. The effort was for the most part an enormous failure, and was almost entirely abandoned. Why? It was because even with all those billions of mutations, there were no significant new beneficial mutations arising. Sanford\n \n \n This theory is intellectually dead. It amazes me that so many people are so in love with it. \n \n Dr. J.C Sanford -- Genetic Entropy and the Mystery of the Genome\n \n Dr. Lee Spetner -- Not By Chance\n \n Dr. Giuseppe Sermonti -- Why is a Fly Not a Horse",

   "The failure to observe even one mutation that adds information is more than just a failure to find support for the theory. It is evidence against the theory. Spetner\n\n \n Not true. I googled \"helpful mutation\" and got a nice list of examples. I wish creationists would do some research before making wild assertions.\n \n \nSo right off the bat we're expected to have blind faith in a miracle that's never been seen, proven, tested - or even witnessed. But that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n \n I couldn't have said it any better myself. Could I use that quote?\n \n \nWe now know that human nucleotides exist in large linked clusters or blocks, ranging in size from 10,000 to a million. These linkage blocks are inherited as a single unit, and never break apart. This totally negates one of the most fundamental assumptions of the theorists - that each nucleotide can be viewed as an individually selectable unit. Dr. J.C. Sanford (geneticist) (Of course this annihilates the whole theory as well.)\n\n \n Ok, so are you saying that nucleotides aren't individually selectable? Is that it?\n Well, actually, they are. No, I'm not saying that they are passed down separately or anything. Please don't write your rebuttal before reading this post.\n What I'm saying is that one nucleotide can make a difference in whether an organism survives or does not survive. For example, let's consider penguins and the Galapagos. Now, it is a well known fact that the Galapagos were formed relatively recently. Before then, it is generally accepted that penguins were in Antarctica only. In Antarctica, penguins had plenty of feathers, enough to die when they progressed to the tropics. However, penguins also had variation in their feathers, so when a current brought them to the Galapagos, they quickly started to evolve. The few nucleotides that controlled feather thickness made a large difference to the survival of the penguins. In this case, they were important enough to make a difference easily. The DNA was inherited as a single unit, but some single units had single parts that made a difference.\n \n \nAnd as I have stated before, evolutionists are afraid of testing animals. They're afraid to test to see if individual animals quickly change phenotypes as a result of an environmental change. (I challenge anyone to prove me wrong with a link.)\n\n \n Do you want something other than peppered moths, bacteria developing resistance to antibiotics, Darwin's finches, and the other species of the Galapagos?\n Maybe biologists are not allowed to do tests on animals that will kill many of them. This reminds me of Kent Hovind's reward for evidence of evolution: impossible to fulfill.\n \n \nAnd the reason for this is they do not accept the notion that the environment can cause a mutation. Thus, they simply chicken out when it comes to any testing that would falsify their theory. However, what they DO do, is resort to confusing people by playing around with bacteria and other assorted organisms in the lab.\n\n \n Scientists do not want to (and/or are not allowed to) do experiments on animals that will kill some of them. All of the evidence that you will find will be based on experiments that do not harm animals (except, of course, for insects).\n \n \nit is still a NON-RANDOM mutation...and the only reason the mutation occurred is because the organism was physically put in the presence of an outside influence; ie...the environment induced the mutation. It's no different -- in theory -- than putting a fish in a different environment and watching it change colors...\n \n http://www.mpks.org/faq/ans128.shtml\n\n \n The mechanism, according to biologists, is a random mutation that would usually not reproduce much, but reproduces when the rest of the bacteria are removed. The mutation becomes a standard gene at this point.\n \n \n The resistant bacterium has not evolved - in fact it has digressed genetically and is defective. Such a mutant strain is rapidly replaced by \"superior\" (i.e. natural) bacteria as soon as the antibiotic is removed. Another example would be the hairless Chihuahua dog. In extreme heat, reduction of size and loss of hair may be useful adaptation, but this involves degeneration. Sanford\n \n And this is more important than it may seem. The fact is, it's not just bacteria - but all of life is in a state of constant degeneration via mutations.\n\n \n Cite your source, preferably online, so that it can be found easily. Of course, this is like you asking for an example of tests done on animals (I assume that you mean vertebrates). Mutations can be harmful and often are, except when a selective pressure is exerted. In those cases, some mutations become helpful, and those reproduce. Please research your claims.\n \n \nEven one of evolutionists' favorite examples for \"deliberate\" mutations, radiation, has a negative, degenerating effect on the crops it effected.
