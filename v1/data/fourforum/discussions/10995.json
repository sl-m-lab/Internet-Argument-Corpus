   "Were all the millions of people who lived in the pre-Christian history of the world mistaken in their religious beliefs? Did they all go to hell? If not, why not?\n\n Firstly, from what I've read, it seems to depend on any number of Christian beliefs and interpretations about God and Hell to begin with. For example there's a school of thought that subscribes to the idea of \"universal salvation\", because God is \"all love\" and he wouldn't be able to bear the suffering of his creations. Other folks imagine no Hell with eternal torture, but instead souls are \"snuffed out\". A popular idea seems to be that if you've never heard of Jesus and had the chance to \"accept him as your lord and saviour\", then God will judge you independently based on other factors.\n \n This raises one of many paradoxes because of God's supposed omniscience.\n \n I put pretty much your exact question to a young \"born again\" fundamentalist guy named Andrew. He had a hard-on for \"John14:6\" - \n 'Jesus saith... I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.'\n \n First I asked Andrew what happens to good people who can't believe the tales about Jesus and salvation. He replied -\n \nTrue, there are alot of good people out there. They are kind and generous only thinking of others. But unless they have that one to one relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ then they are dammned to hell.\n\n Oh. So I asked \"...what if I was a wee kiddie born in Peru in, say, 20ad? And let's say that throughout my life I honoured my mum and dad, didn't covet this or that, didn't murder anyone, etc etc. It's 20ad and I'm in Peru, 1,988 years ago. Nobody knows diddly squat about no Jesus-someone-or-other. Am I going to HELL? Is that FAIR?\"\n \n Andrew answered -\n \nIf a person has never heard of Jesus, then their salvation is in the hands of God. I cannot answer that. However, if someone hears about Jesus and rejects him, then it doesn't matter how good you have been. You can follow the 10 Commandments all you like, but Jesus said, \"I am the way, the truth and the life, no-one comes to the father except by me.\" \n \n Jesus is the ONLY way of salvation.\n\n I asked - \"Where in all of the Bible does it refer to the fate of people who haven't heard of Jesus?\"\n \nThe Bible does not mention the fate of those who have never heard the gospel of Jesus Christ. What I said is nothing but an accepted theory. If you ask me I will say that the ONLY way to be saved is through Christ Jesus. The only unforgivable sin, is to reject Jesus.\n\n Uh-huh. \n \"So according to you, either every good man, woman, child, and baby who died throughout history without the chance to accept Jesus, is burning in hell, or the fair and loving god, being fair and loving, would forgive all sins but the unforgivable sin, and allow the poor ignorant saps to enter the kingdom of heaven. Sure. That sounds about right. But wait...! The Bible says the ONLY way to be saved is through Christ Jesus! Looks like that should say \"the only two ways to be saved are through Christ Jesus, or to have never heard of him\".\n \n \nI believe that God knows that if they heard the Gospel, if they would accept him or not.\nOf course he does, he's omniscient!\n \n \"So there's no point in telling them about Jesus. Because if that person hasn't heard of Jesus, but you come along and that person somehow \"sees the light\", then nothing at all has changed about that person's eternal fate because God knew their mind anyway. And nobody needs to hear about Jesus or be given the choice to be saved. That person was going to heaven whether they heard about Jesus or not, because God knew they would \"see the light\". As far as you or I are concerned, we think the outcome is variable when in fact it's not. This also means there's no free will, just the illuson of free will to us as human beings. Whether you hear about Jesus or not, God knows before you're born whether or not you're going to heaven.\"",

However, to be honest I'm not really that interested in defending them here in terms of debate. In my experience on these sort of issues, real debate over them never really gets anywhere. These are my beliefs, and I see no need in defending them anyway--they are personal beliefs. Nor are they really in need of being challenged, as they are not presenting danger to anyone. I can't give you some external reason for believing these things other than simply what I've experienced in the religion itself from it's sacred texts, church tradition, and personal religious experiences.\n \n \nDo you contend that there is only one god, or are there many?\n\n \n I believe there is only one, in the sense of a supernatural (and supernaturally powerful) being.\n \n \nIf your god is the only true one, does it follow from this that all of the people who haven&#8217;t had Christian religious experiences &#8211; i.e. now, or at any other time in history anywhere in the world &#8211; are (or have been) mistaken in their religious beliefs?\n\n \n Yes.\n \n \nWhat gives a person&#8217;s Christian religious experiences a greater claim on the truth than another person&#8217;s alternative religious experiences?\n\n \n Nothing, really. But naturally, people go on what they experience. \n \n \nIf other people might be right, - and bearing in mind the possible implications - why wouldn&#8217;t you invest an equal amount of effort in attaining as many religious experiences as possible, so you could make an informed decision?\n\n \n You mean ones outside of Christianity? If so, then a.) Because I don't see the need, and b.) because I believe it would constitute idolatry/apostasy anyway. With that said, there are people out there who have been a part of multiple religions and settled on Christianity. Converts from so-and-so religion. The same applies the other way too, of course (converts from Christianity.) Also, while I've not partaken in 'religious experiences' in other religions (truly being a part of those religions) I've done quite a bit of work in my life in the field of comparative religion--and so I've definitely weighed the pros and cons of many religions.\n \n \nAgain bearing in mind the implications, why is it wise to settle for (most often) your first and only experiences, especially when you would say the other religious people are unduly influenced, with the potential for error (&#8220;bogusness&#8221;) increased by the fact that their experiences are very likely influenced by their culture or upbringing? For example, you would very likely recommend that all of the lost souls praying to false gods should seek and find the same truth as you - it's for their benefit after all. Why would the same practice not be required of you?\n\n \n If I understand your question, the answer is simply that I believe that I am correct and that they are not. But keep in mind I'm not interested in imposing anything on them. They are free to choose my religion, or not, as they want, or not.\n \n \nWhy doesn&#8217;t everyone have Christian religious experiences, since it&#8217;s the one true religion?\n\n \n I don't know. Perhaps God simply chooses not to reveal Himself to everyone. Or maybe the gospel itself IS a revelation of God, and people just don't want to accept it.\n \n \nAre only Christian religious experiences true religious experiences, and all others (past and present) are bogus religious experiences?\n\n \n IMO, the Judeo-Christian experiences, yes.\n \n \nHow do you tell the difference between a truthful religious experience and a bogus one?\n\n \n There is no outside way of telling, for certain. It's a matter of faith. Again, these are the beliefs I've settled on.\n \n \nIf all religious experiences have the same probability of being correct, what other criteria can you rely on?\n\n \n Again, there is no outside 'criteria'. I can only tell you that my religion works for me, and I go on religious experience and faith to conclude that.",

   "Scientists contradict logic and science when they preach that everything in the universe has a cause &#8211; and that's science, except the universe itself &#8211; in which case discussion of cause is religion and anti-science.\n It is inconceivable that the \"Prime Force Singularity,\" the only thing around at the time, was anything other than the Omniscient Singularity Force having a comparably intelligent purpose in creating both this universe around us and you and me in it.\n \n What are the implications of an Omniscient Creator? First, an Entity Who is Omniscient makes no mistakes. Therefore, the Omniscient Creator is Perfect, i.e., no imperfection exists, or can exist, in the Creator &#8211; as that would render Him imperfect, an intractable contradiction. The absorption of an imperfection, such as imperfect humans like you or me, would, therefore, render an Omniscient Creator self-contradictory. This is the very essence of the principle of Qod\u00ebsh and le-havdil bein Qod\u00ebsh le-khol. In other words, the Creator must remain Perfect (Tehilim 92.16) and Immutable (Mal\u00e2khi 3.6). This has compelling implications in sorting out the single logical, single true understanding of the Singularity-Creator from the myriad errors. This implies that no contradictions may be attributed to a Perfect Creator simply because of humankind's limited, and distorted, understanding.\n \n Einstein observed that the Creator isn't capricious. The Creator of the complex physical laws of our universe, many still far beyond our understanding, imply the Omniscient Creator. An Omniscient Creator, in turn, implies the creation of an intelligible universe &#8211; and you and me within that intelligent and intelligible purpose (Dev\u00e2rim 30.11-14). The only real challenge to our intelligence is to derive this purpose in accordance with His laws &#8211; logic, not feelings and intuition.\n \n This further implies that an Intelligent and non-capricious Creator would not \n leave His sapient creatures without an Instruction Manual to ascertain, and aspire to, His purpose. Logic dictates that an intelligent and non-capricious Ha-Sheim has certainly provided, and ensured the survival of, His Instruction Manual somewhere in timespace that is accessible to intelligent seekers (i.e., in history rather than buried on a still-undiscovered planet or the like) and bears His Imprimatur and Endorsement. Consequently, the circumspect sapien will search for His Signature, His Signet stamp in the affairs of humankind, immediately followed by the handing down of His Instruction Manual. Unsurprisingly, one finds His Instruction Book as simply as translating \"Instruction Book\" into the language of Avr\u00e2h\u00e2m \u00c2vinu, Yitzkh\u00e2q \u00c2vinu, Yisr\u00e2&#8226;eil, Mosh\u00ebh and Ribi Yehoshua: &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; (Seiph\u00ebr Tor\u00e2h)!!!\n \n One can pursue this quest from Atlantis to \"ancient mariners\" and today's UFO reports searching for His Signature. Yet, only one great series of (natural) miracles stands out in the history of mankind, heralding the Creator's Signature. This Signature is attested in a well-documented ancient text that enjoys continuing archaeological and scientific corroboration with every new discovery. This text describes the 10 makot that culminated in Israel's Yetzi\u00e2h [exodus] from Mitzrayim [Egypt]. This increasingly corroborated document, the Hebrew Tana\"kh, signals the Divine predesign in the affairs of humankind &#8211; His Signature and Imprimatur. Moreover, we find His Seiph\u00ebr Tor\u00e2h handed down directly thereafter.\n \n Quote from: Atonement in the Biblical New Covenant\n \n Netzarim (led by Paqid Yirmeyahu ha-Tzadiq; found by using Google: \"Netzarim, Restored 'Nazarene Jews' of Israel\"; watch out for the Christian pretend-Netzarim)\n \n The Torah is the Instructions of the Creator. Hence Judaism is the correct religion.\n \n From Anders Branderud\n Geir Toshav, Netzarim in Ra&#8217;anana in Israel who are followers of Ribi Yehoshua &#8211; the Messiah &#8211; in Orthodox Judaism",
