They are WAY outside their constitutionally enumerated power in countless areas. They have brought this country to the brink of economic destruction, and we will probably not be able to recover. They have systematically stripped americans of our rights and made damn sure there is nothing we can really do about it.

From 1915 to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. ------------------------------\n \n Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, a total of 13 million Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated. \n ------------------------------ \n \n China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\n ------------------------------ \n \n Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\n ---- ------------- ------------- \n \n Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\n ------------------------------ \n \n Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million educated people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\n ----------------------------- \n \n Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century because of gun control: 56 million.\n ------------------------------ \n \n You won't see this data on the US evening news, or hear politicians disseminating this information.\n \n Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws adversely affect only the law-abiding citizens.\n \n Take note my fellow Americans, before it's too late!\n \n The next time someone talks in favor of gun control, please remind them of this history lesson.\n \n With guns, we are 'citizens'. Without them, we are 'subjects'. During WW II the Japanese decided not to invade America because they knew most Americans were ARMED!\n \n If you value your freedom, please spread this anti gun-control message to all of your friends.\n \n The purpose of fighting is to win. There is no possible victory in defense. The sword is more important than the shield, and skill is more important than either. The final weapon is the brain. All else is supplemental.\n \n \n",

   "Question time again. From 1994 to 2004 we had a law that supposedly banned the manufacture and purchase of certain guns and magazines under the false term \"assault weapons\" and this law supposedly did a lot of good because these items were banned from civilian ownership. This is despite a lot of gun control advocates saying the law didn't go far enough.\n \n Now, from 1934 to today we've had a law on the books that has allowed for the legal ownership of machine guns, grenades, and tank killing rifles, so long as they're registered and documented and a tax is paid on them. So under the law a person could own Tony Montana's setup made famous in the movie Scarface, right down to the 40mm grenades for blowing up doors.\n \n Back to the \"assault weapons\" as they're called. Apparently NFA rules aren't good enough for when it comes to assault weapons because gun control advocates want to take it a step farther and ban them outright in all instances. Apparently magazines of certain capacity are too dangerous to own even if they're registered with the ATF and a $200 transfer fee is paid on them. Apparently a $30 magazine is more dangerous than a 9mm Uzi submachine gun or an entire crate of dynamite.",
