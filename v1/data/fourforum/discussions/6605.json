   "I have come to the point where I believe Braodway will turn anything into a musical. They are in the works for making a musical of Spider-Man and also, last week I heard of workings for a musical of The Lord Of The Rings. They have made musicals based off of works of musical groups and aritst (ABBA, Beach Boys, Billy Joel) and old horror novels (Dracula, Dr. Jeckel and Mr. Hyde, ect.) My question is, what's next?\n With the musicals based off of songs by artist, I think there should be one based off of the songs of Meat Loaf. But that's just me.",

   "Does nobody have any opinion on this at all? Is The Lord Of The Rings Musical a good idea? Or does anyone feel that Broadway has come up with enough musicals?\n \n Hey, maybe they could have a Rock Opera for The Wolf-Man. And then they could have a bunch of songs in the style of hair metal from the 80's. I would that be taking the whole hair thing too far?",
