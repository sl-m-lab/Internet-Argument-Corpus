It's not in their best interest. They have a 50/50 chance of winning when there are two parties. If a third comes into the play, it's 33/33/33 (all things equal). The two parties work TOGETHER to screw the third, every, single, time. It, IMO, CANNOT happen unless it was mandated by law. And as I said in another post, how can one expect that to happen when the law makers are all one of the two parties in power? \n \n Third parties at best will show Dems/Repubs what issues are bubbling to the top, and hopefully they will latch onto a few, now and then.\n \n -Mach",
