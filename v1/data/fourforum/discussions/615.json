   "I found the prospect of artificial skin with full sensory responses to be an intriguing prospect. Therefore, I looked up various aspects of this emerging biotechnological field. I will do my best to sum up some of the information that I found.\n \n First, I can tell you that there is a field of material science that is interested in grafting collagen-GAG matrices onto the affected areas of the skin. These matrices act as a growth-medium, which breaks down as the new dermal layers naturally form. In addition, the graft is covered by a protective silicone-barrier, until new growth is complete. To address the issue of nerve damage, degradable tubes are used within the matrix, and lined up to the severed nerve endings. The nerves then expand through the use of the medium. Success in humans has been limited, but this technology does seem promising. In fact, these methods are being researched in organs that display more complicated intricacies than the dermal layers. Dr. Yannas at MIT conducted this work.\n source: MIT News office\n \n Many other studies have been conducted by MIT researchers at the Touch Lab (Laboratory for Human and Machine Haptics). The Touch Lab is concerned how human haptics and senses work, how such principles can be employed in machines, and how machines can be used to enhance the lives of humans. Currently, they employ a robot that learns from the movements of the human hand. They have multiple studies concerning the mechanics behind tactile response and how these differentials are transduced, modulated, and then sent to the brain for analysis. Certainly, MIT's work in this field will be of importance when it comes to developing systems that can be applied to the biotechnology fields.\n sources: MIT - Role of Skin Biomechanics; MIT - Research Index\n \n The work discussed above closely resembles numerous other laboratories, and there work to solve this problem. Many polymers have been developed to result in the formation of new skin, and many man-hours have been used to find adequate ways of producing conduits that will aid in the regeneration of damaged nerves. By far, one of the most promising technologies includes the use of lasers to direct to growth of nerve fibers. It has been shown that the direction of nerve growth can be manipulated with precision, if lasers are used as a guide. This coupled with collagen matrices, prosthetic limbs, and artificial organs, such as eyes, has wide ranging application. It can be said that we now have the ability to make nerve connections more pro-actively than first imagined.\n source: Nature Magazine\n \n The ability to map circuits with the human nervous system leads us to the next important topic that relates to the field of tissue engineering, which is the use of optical waveguides as a synthetic nerve. Once again we are finding fiber optics to be of enormous consequence to the field of electronics. However, now we are using this technology as a means of transmitting tactile response signals in prosthetic limbs. Some researchers are creating AI programs that will allow some sort of interface between the fiber optic network within the artificial limb and the central nervous system. It is easy to imagine how the laser guided growth method could be of importance in mapping the circuits necessary for this interface to exist.\n \n Furthermore, optical computing is the subject of much of today's research. It is thought that current methods we use for microprocessing can be carried over for optical systems comprised of fiber optic materials on a nano-scale. The advantage to this remains increased processing speed and a more efficient system. There exists a loss of energy associated with transducing optical signals to the electric signals used in today's computers. If microprocessors could be built with this material, it is thought that computers might once again undergo an evolutionary jump. One of the major problems impeding this jump is the thermodynamic properties of the materials. As always, heat transfer and physical deformity is a real concern for the system.\n \n Whatever they future holds for this exciting field, this cutting edge technology exists as one of today's philosophical questions plaguing the public. As with cloning, human-machine interfacing and smart technology poses serious questions for humanity to ponder. Blurring the distinction between man and machine brings back to question of multiple realizability. For decades, images of cyborgs have dominated mainstream science fiction. Will the need to further the prospects of the medical field make the often-prophetic views of the science fiction writer a reality? Is Ray Kurzweil right when he claims that man's next step in the evolutionary process is to merge with the machines? What's to prevent someone from using this kind of technology to enhance his or her physical performance? Will bionic alterations be the next popular form of body modification, replacing the tat, or breast enhancements? Only time will tell.",
