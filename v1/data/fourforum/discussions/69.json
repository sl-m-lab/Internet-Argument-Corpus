   "i always think its funny when people insist that the underlining cause of the civil war was not slavery, but states rights. the fact is that the states rights issue was a result of the slavery issue.\n \n by 1860, cotton was the chief export of the South. while the Northern states were moving towards industrialization and manufacturing, the South opposed this and continued to be an agrarian society. a manufacturing economy does not require slave labor, but an economy that revolves around cotton does. therefore, the Southern states were very reluctant to give up their rights to own states.\n \n at the same time, the South did want some of the manufacturing products that the Northern states were producing. in order to increase profits, the federal government forced high tariffs on these goods. naturally, the Southern states were opposed to high tariffs. but the fact is, tariffs were the federal government's main source of revenue (there was no federal income tax back in those days). they needed this revenue to federally finance improvements in the Northwest Territory. this is why these territories supported high tariffs unlike their agrarian counterparts to the south.\n \n the Southern states also supported popular sovereignty, the idea of the states (not the federal government) deciding whether or not to allow slavery. slaveholders were afraid that a centralized federal government would take away their right to own slaves. an industrial economy required a strong central government but an agrarian economy did not.\n \n states rights were a huge cause of the civil war, no doubt. but the fact is, states rights would never have been as big of an issue had slavery not been an issue. slavery was the underlining cause of the war.",

   "ok lets go over everything:\n \n high tariffs: the south was dependent on cotton (particularly after eli whitney invented the cotton gin in 1793). picking cotton was strenuous labor and many plantations required slaves in order to work efficiently. southerners were allowed to have slaves, therefore they could grow cotton. while the south was still an agrarian economy, the north began industrializing by the very end of the 18th century. we saw a lot of manufacturing. southerners wanted these goods too, but there were no factories in the south because we were still using slave labor and cotton. the only way southerners could receive manufactured goods was to get them from the north. therefore, the south was very upset when the federal government set high tariffs on manufactured goods. this all goes back to the south relying on slave labor and not industrializing.\n \n states rights: i always consider \"popular sovereignty\" a states rights issue. you probably remember that popular sovereignty allowed the new territories that were becoming states to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their state. southerners were all for popular sovereignty while northerners believed that the new territories should not be allowed to have slavery at all.\n \n i think you are ignoring some key issues here. early on, we have the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 which banned slavery in the new territories including Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. then we have the infamous Missouri Compromise in 1818. this said that any territory north of 36'30' would be a free state (with the exception of Missour, of course:)). \n the Mexican War created new problems when the united states annexed new territories (california, texas, new mexico, arizona) when anti-slavery forces demanded that slavery not be allowed in any new territories gained by the Mexican War. the Compromise of 1850 established California as a free state in order to keep the balance in the senate and granted popular sovereignty to the new territories.\n the big controversy was the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. this act established popular sovereignty in these new states, but also repealed the Missouri Compromise because they were both above the 36'30' boundary. this obviously enraged northerners and created more tension between the north and the south.\n \n and who can forget Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin? this novel created an anti-slavery sentiment in the North and intensified sectional differences.\n \n the Dred Scott case in 1857 also enraged many northerners when Scott was considered to be \"property\".\n \n and then of course we have John Brown's raid in which he tried to rally up slaves to revolt against their masters. he was executed and many northerners considered him to be a martyr.\n \n all of these events helped create more and more tension between the North and the South and they were all related to slavery. i just cannot imagine there being a civil war if slavery had never existed in the united states at all.",

   "Falling,\n \n I agree, \"lets go over everything:[sic]\"\n \n Certainly the tariff problems stemmed from the Southern use of traditional slavery, but you forgot to mention what the North did to the Irish. The North used the Irish because they hated blacks. Several Northern States passed laws banning the extended stay of a mulatto or Negro within its borders, and the Northern hate of blacks is also what helped get the Fugitive Slave Act passed.\n \n If you are suggesting that \"popular sovereignty\" as held by the States was a good thing, then I agree with you. Madison said that there was \"no power [in the Constitution] to warrant it (slave emancipation).\" Therefore slavery properly fell under the category of \"State's rights.\" Whether it wished to end the practice or to allow it to continue was originally an issue for each State to decided for itself.\n \n Although the treaties and compromises mentioned are interesting points and would certainly be relevant in a full debate on this subject, I think them to be of little weight when discussing the cause(s) of the WSI. I think that the defining of the phrases \"cause\" and \"factor\" might serve to bring a swifter resolution to this controversy.\n \n Cause: \"a ground for choice of action\"\n Factor: \"One of the elements that contribute to a cause\"\n \n If we follow the logic set forth in these definitions then it something like obvious that slavery was not the \"ground for...action\" itself, but simply \"one of the elements that contribute to a cause.\" Certainly it is hard to think of a situation where slavery would not have been a/the factor in a war between the States/former States of this Union, but even when both sections actively practiced slavery John Adams noted that \"the character of the gentlemen in the four New England colonies differ from those in the others (Southern)...as much as several distinct nations almost.\" I think the differences were too great in the two sections of this nation to be resolved except by time or war. \n \n And just a side note that I will put in here is that less than 6% (about 300,000) of the Southern States' populace owned any amount of slaves, and only 3% (roughly 150,000) owned more than five. I do not believe slavery was big a far spread as many people believe it to have been.",

But when you get out of the mindset of the \"soldier's cause\" and start looking at the \"ground for choice of action\" we are faced with a much different picture. The cause, as defined, was not one of a moral nature, such as slavery, nor so much of a legal nature, such as State's rights, but, in my view, on of defence.

   "i always think its funny when people insist that the underlining cause of the civil war was not slavery, but states rights.\n\n \n Yes, I find that funny as well, for Abraham Lincoln did not run on a platform of abolishing slavery in the least and in his First Inaugural Address explicitly stated he had no desire to do so.\n \n \nthe fact is that the states rights issue was a result of the slavery issue.\n\n \n That is false. By the 1860s, the South was paying the overwhelming majority of federal revenues. There was no income tax and the primary source of government revenues was from duties on European imports that disproportionately fell on Southerners, the vast majority of whom did not even own slaves at all. The revenue raised by Southern trade with Europe was being fleeced from the South and sent North through the House of Representatives to finance the industrialization of the North. The North sought to subsidize its inefficient manafacturing industry at the expense of the South and to divert trade with the Western states away from a low tarriff Southern Confederacy. Economics, not slavery was the cause of the War Between the States. Most American Wars have been economically motivated as well.\n \n \nby 1860, cotton was the chief export of the South. \n\n \n Yes it is true the South was exporting products abroad and buying cheaper European manafactured goods.\n \n \nwhile the Northern states were moving towards industrialization and manufacturing\n\n \n The manafacturing base of the North was PROTECTED by high tarriffs imposed on European imports. Northern industry was being coddled by the Federal Government, at the EXPENSE of the South. \n \n \nthe South opposed this and continued to be an agrarian society.\n\n \n LOL the South oppossed high tarriffs on European goods and the fact that it was the South that was paying BY FAR the majority of revenues to the Federal Government, which were appropriated through the House of Representatives for infrastructure and industrialization products in the NORTH. The North was enriching itself at the expense of the South and sought to use the tarriff issue to divert Western trade to Northern ports, at the expense of the South. That is precisely what caused the War Between the States.\n \n \na manufacturing economy does not require slave labor, but an economy that revolves around cotton does.\n\n \n This is a lie and is not true at all. The entire British Empire abolished slavery peacefully in just several years, as did Brazil without firing a single shot. Further, free labour is much more profitable by than slave labour and the Upper South was massively divesting itself from the slavery anyway, selling their slaves to the Gulf States. Capital Intensive agriculture was killing slavery in the United States just as it had in DOZENS of other nations throughout the world anyway. Do we need slave labour to pick cotton today? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \ntherefore, the Southern states were very reluctant to give up their rights to own states.\n\n \n This is on its face ridiculous. Slavery as an issue in the war did not even arise until well into the middle of the conflict. Lincoln himself said on NUMEROUS occassions that he had no intention whatsoever of interfering with the slavery institution of the Southern states. Lincoln proposed a Constitutional Amendment in 1861 that would have legalized slavery forever, as he cited in his own inaugural address. He DID state however that he was entirely unwilling to negotiate regarding tarriffs on imported European goods, the PROTECTIONISM that was the bread and butter of his own Northern financers. Lincoln was more than willing to work out a deal with the South regarding slavery. \n \n \nat the same time, the South did want some of the manufacturing products that the Northern states were producing.\n\n \n That is because they were much more expensive and the North was not buying the equivilant exports of the South, but was penalizing the South with a protective tarriff and fleecing the South of revenue.\n \n \nin order to increase profits, the federal government forced high tariffs on these goods. \n\n \n Yes, in order to increase the profits of Northern manafacturers and the politicians they bankrolled like Abraham Lincoln.\n \n \nnaturally, the Southern states were opposed to high tariffs. \n\n \n Which remains true to this day, well after the abolition of slavery. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nbut the fact is, tariffs were the federal government's main source of revenue (there was no federal income tax back in those days). \n\n \n Yes that is true. The South was bankrolling the federal government and a low tarriff South would have obliterated Northern trade and drawn the Western states into the orbit of the South.\n \n \nthey needed this revenue to federally finance improvements in the Northwest Territory.\n\n \n And in the North, which had been the case for decades and a source of bitter dispute.\n \n \nthis is why these territories supported high tariffs unlike their agrarian counterparts to the south.\n\n \n Yes it was out of financial self interest and had nothing whatsoever to do with moralistic rhetoric over slavery.\n \n \nthe Southern states also supported popular sovereignty, the idea of the states (not the federal government) deciding whether or not to allow slavery.\n\n \n Slavery was protected under the Constitution.\n \n \nslaveholders were afraid that a centralized federal government would take away their right to own slaves.\n\n \n This is not true at all. The South was afraid that the federal government would raise tarriffs to further enrich itself at the expense of the South, which was a legitimate concern. Lincoln was more than willing to accomodate the South with regards to slavery as I pointed out before.\n \n \nan industrial economy required a strong central government but an agrarian economy did not.\n\n \n You mean a NORTHERN industrial economy requires PROTECTIONISM from competition to enrich itself at the expense of the South and of consumers. Quite naturally the South was opposed to Lincoln's plan to enrich his supporters at their expense.\n \n \nstates rights were a huge cause of the civil war, no doubt.\n\n \n Yes the states created the Federal Government, it is quite ridiculous to suggest that the Federal Government is superior to its own antecedents, which delegated power to the Federal Government in the first place.\n \n \nbut the fact is, states rights would never have been as big of an issue had slavery not been an issue. \n\n \n No that is not a fact at all because States Rights continued to be a major factor in Southern politics for decades afterwards and remains the case to this very day. The Civil War was a contest between the North and the South over the desire of the North to create a strong centralized federal government, a dictatorship, at the economic and political expense of the South. The war was not fought for any moralistic reason in the least. It was fought on one side for independence and on the other side for the desire to financially exploit other populations, as was no doubt proven beyond a shadow of a doubt by the conduct of the North after the war.\n \n \nslavery was the underlining cause of the war.\n\n \n This is not true at all. The economic and political dispute between the North and the South, regarding first the growing importance of the West and bitterness of the North enriching itself at the expense of the South caused the war. Lincoln was more than willing to come to an agreement with the South with regards to slavery. His emancipation proclomation did not end slavery at all in the border states or the occupied states. Lincoln said himself that if he could save the Union and collect his tarriff he was more than willing to come to an agreement with regards to slavery. This is where you come in and say that it was slavery that was the source of revenue for the South, and where I disagree by pointing out to you that slavery was naturally coming to an end in the South anyway, as it did in Brazil, because of advancement in capital intensive agriculture, immigration, and the profitability of free labour.",

   "heydrich, you dont make much sense at all. first of all, me and american had a misunderstanding about our definitions of cause and factor. i said in a later post that slavery was not the cause of the civil war, but it was the main factor.\n\n \n That is precisely the argument. My argument is that slavery was not the cause of the War Between the States at all, that the tarriff dispute was the immediate cause of the War Between the States, which makes perfect sense since South Carolina had came close to seceding decades earlier for the very same reason.\n \n \ndid you not read what i said? i said that tariffs were the main source of revenue for the government back then, therefore the south was paying more. \n\n \n Yes it is true that the South was paying the vast majority of federal revenues, capital which was appropriated for spending projects and infrastructure projects such as canals in the Northern states. This is not unlike the relationship between the American colonies and Great Britain in the least. In actuality, the economic burden of the North upon the South was much greater than England's taxation of the American colonies.\n \n What does this say?\n \n Article I, Section 9\n \n . . . No preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one state over those of another: nor shall vessels bound to, or from, one state, be obliged to enter, clear or pay duties in another. . . \n \n \nbut it was their own fault.\n\n \n No, it was not the fault of the South that the North was using its population advantage unconstitutional in Congress to regulate commerce for their own regional advantage.\n \n \nthey chose to have an agrarian economy with slave labor the north chose to move to a manufacturing economy.\n\n \n The North chose to have a manafacturing economy protected unconstitutionally by a high tarriff on imports, protected from competition, sustained at the expense of other parts of the country in the Congress. Why the South should be party to an agreement which was so flagrently and continually disregarded by the North, and thus voided, mystifies me.\n \n \nGreat Britain abolished slavery in the british isles in 1772 because they were a manufacturing economy. \n\n \n Great Britain did not have a large domestic slave population either, like the South, and thus the specter of a \"Haiti\" happening in the UK.\n \n \nthere was no need for slave labor. when eli whitney invented the cotten gin in 1793, cotton all of a sudden became very profitable and as a result, slavery became more efficient.\n\n \n 1793 is not 1861. Free Labour was killing slavery in the Upper South prior to the War Between the States. Had Lincoln not launched his aggressive war, slavery would have been abolished as easily as the telegraph, just as it was in Brazil.\n \n \nyou do not know brazil history at all!!!! slavery was not banned in brazil until 1888!!! and this occurred AFTER A CIVIL WAR OVERTHREW THE BRAZILIAN EMPIRE. get the facts straight, my friend.\n\n \n Brazilian Civil War 1893-1895\n \n Good Going emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nslavery was a huge issue because the north wanted to stop the EXPANSION of slavery and the south did not want to.\n\n \n The North wanted to gain politically and economically at the expense of the South with regards to the Western States. In this conflict, the issue of slavery was but forth as nothing more than a \"reason\" to justify the position of the North, which had relatively nothing to do with slavery in itself. The North feared Western commerce being drawn into the orbit of the South - at their expense.\n \n \nso you are calling the missouri compromise, the compromise of 1850, and the kansas-nebraska act as a non-issue back then? that is ridiculous.\n\n \n The conflict was over POWER, like all political disputes are, over commerce with the Western States and being able to influence them POLITICALLY. In that struggle slavery was used as an issue by one side to gain an advantage over the other. \n \n \ni think you misunderstood me. i didnt mean to say that states rights and tariffs were non-issues after the civil war\n\n \n That was precisely the case. The North and the South ever since the origin of the nation had totally different ideas of how to go about constructing a national government and what type of economic policy it should follow. This is nothing more than reflective of the broad cultural differences between the two regions, the absence of which there would have been no war.\n \n \nTHE ELECTION OF LINCOLN CAUSED SOUTH CAROLINA TO IMMEDIATELY SECEDE FROM THE UNION. THAT IS A HISTORICAL FACT\n\n \n Lincoln also ran on a platform of enacting the highest tarriff in American history, worse than the tarriff of abominations which had motivated South Carolina to attempt to secede years earlier. It is not South Carolina's fault that Northern industry was so pathetically inefficent, that it was losing to its foreign competitors, and required protection and subsidation to keep from floating over like a dead whale. South Carolina was sick and tired of being an economic colony of the North, a policy which continued for decades AFTER the War Between the States.\n \n \na month before the election Governor William Henry Gist of South Carolina wrote the governors of all the southern states except texas that South Carolina would secede in the event of Lincoln's election and asked what course the other states would follow. \n\n \n South Carolina also threatened to secede during Andrew Jackson's presidency over the tarriff issue, not slavery by the way.\n \n \nas soon as it was certain that Lincoln had won, the South Carolina legislature summoned a special convention. it met on December 17, 1860, in Charleston. three days later the convention unanimously passed an ordinance dissolving \"the union now subsisting between South Carolina and other States.\"\n\n \n I applaud South Carolina's move to emancipate itself from the despotism and tyranny of the United States and the dictator Abraham Lincoln. Clearly in the aftermath of the war we came to see the enormous wisdom of South Carolina's pre-emptive secession, as the Republican tyrants abolished the State of South Carolina and imposed military rule years after the war was over.\n \n \nIF YOU DONT BELIEVE ME, I CAN GIVE YOU A MILLION RELIABLE SOURCES.\n\n \n Is there some kind of chain preventing South Carolina from seceding from the United States? \n \n \nif you can read AT ALL, you would know that there was a misunderstanding between me and american. i said in my last post that the election of lincoln \"caused\" south carolina to secede and the firing a northern ship by confederates guarding fort sumter caused the civil war itself. \n\n \n There would have been no ships to fire on if there had been no blockade, an act of war.\n \n \nlincoln calling for troops from the border states caused some of the border states (north carolina and virginia) to secede.\n\n \n Yes, that is interesting to note. If the Upper South was so concerned about slavery, if slavery caused the war, why didn't the Upper South secede along with the Gulf States originally? Better yet, why did the border states remain in the Union?\n \n Answer: Because Abraham Lincoln was absolutely more than willing to accomodate the South with regards to slavery, the Upper South knew that it was safer with slavery in the Union under Lincoln than outside of it without his fugitive slave law. The Upper South seceded because of the TYRANNY and DESPOTISM of Abraham Lincoln, his desire to wage an aggressive war like a Roman Emperor against States which did not want to have any part of his crusade. \n \n The South was MORE THAN JUSTIFIED in seceding from the United States not only for constitutional reasons, but the conduct of the United States during and ESPECIALLY in the aftermath of the war.",

You have all kinds of interesting tidbits that you through in here or there, but nothing to prove that they actually existed the way you say.\n Example: \"My argument is that slavery was not the cause of the War Between the States at all, that the tarriff dispute was the immediate cause of the War Between the States, which makes perfect sense since South Carolina had came close to seceding decades earlier for the very same reason.\" Where is the documentation?\n Example: \"Free Labour was killing slavery in the Upper South prior to the War Between the States.\" Nothing to back up this claim either. Please show me the \"massive litany of facts.\"\n \n Here it is \"real plain and simple:\"\n \n South Carolina \"In the present case, that fact is established with certainty. We assert that fourteen of the States have deliberately refused, for years past, to fulfill their constitutional obligations, and we refer to their own Statutes for the proof. \n \n The Constitution of the United States, in its fourth Article, provides as follows: \n 'No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.'...\n \n The same article of the Constitution stipulates also for rendition by the several States of fugitives from justice from the other States. \n \n The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution.\"\n \n Georgia: \"For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property...\"\n \n Texas: \"She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them? \n \n The controlling majority of the Federal Government, under various pretences and disguises, has so administered the same as to exclude the citizens of the Southern States, unless under odious and unconstitutional restrictions, from all the immense territory owned in common by all the States on the Pacific Ocean, for the avowed purpose of acquiring sufficient power in the common government to use it as a means of destroying the institutions of Texas and her sister slaveholding States.\"\n \n Mississippi: \"Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.\"",

Therefor the war began to focus more on the issue of slavery.\n \n Besides the Tariff of 1819 the south was fighting for slavery, based on states rights.\n For example when Texas was admitted into the Union there was a controversy over whether it would be admitted as a slave or free state. \n The Compromise of 1850 admitted Missouri as a free state and Mississippi was brought into the Union as a free state.\n Other contributions to the war:\n \n Nullification Procolmation: South Carolina said it should be allowed to void any law it disagreed with, which would ultimately divide the union. \n \n Fugitive Slave Act: Allowed southern \"bounty hunters\" to enter free states looking for run away slaves. They with sometimes little evidence would parade them through the streets when caught and this got many abolitionists upset.\n \n So a large part of the events leading up to the war was based on slavery.\n The rights they were fighting for as a state was largely based on slavery. \n \n To say slavery had nothing to do with the war seems a bit ridiculous. \n \n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

An agreement was entered into that SC would not commence military action as long as the military status quo was maintained in Charleston Harbor. This meant, in plain words, the troops would remain where they were (in Fort Moultrie) with no re-enforcements. SC would provide such foodstuffs as the troops would require until such time as the politicians could work out a permanent agreement.\n \n 26 Dec 1860: \n \n UNder cover of darkness, MAJ Anderson transfers his command to Fort Sumter. Sumter, in the harbor proper, is much more defendable than Moultrie (which is on the land). The authorities request that Anderson return to Moultrie, and he refuses. In those days, war was often avoided or waged by such informal agreements as between Anderson as a representative of the US, and the SC military as representative of the Palmetto Republic. This perfidious act of war is not responded to by the SC authorities in a remarkable display of self control. Anderson knew full well what the agreement was, and that his refusal to abide by it in all probability meant war.\n \n 11 Jan 1861:\n \n Surrender of Sumter demanded.\n \n 10 April '61:\n \n The infamous Star Of The West expedition, the SECOND act of war by the United States on SC.\n \n 12-14 April 1861\n \n The Bombardment. Following 3 1/2 months of gentlemanly restraint and numerous attempts at diplomatic entreaty (all of which were ignored by Lincoln) CS and SC forces evict Anderson and his garrison from Charleston Harbor by force. Lincoln wanted a war and provoked SC into action which has been incorrectly percieved as 'starting' the War For Southern Independence. Following the withdrawal of US forces from Sumter with full military honors, a war was JUST what Lincoln got.",

Such is not my theory. Nullification and secession, so often confounded, are indeed antagonistic principles. Nullification is a remedy which it is sought to apply within the Union, and against the agent of sates. It is only to be justified when the agent has violated his constitutional obligation, and a state, assuming to judge for itself, denies the right of the agent thus to act, and appeals to the other states of the Union for a decision; but when the states themselves, and when the people of the states, have so acted as to convince us that they will not regard our constitutional rights, then, and then for the first time, arises the doctrine of secession in its practical application.\"",

Why don't they baptize their dogs, cows, horses? The only symbolism to baptizing somebody is to resurrect their souls with Christ. Only humans have souls. Further, this is the reason the Baptist church became popular. They would baptize their slaves, and if an owner were to abuse his power greatly, the owner would have to wash the feet of his slave. Catholics also had to practice penance for having slaves in the first place, as slavery was abolished and considered a sin in the Church since the late 15th century.\n \n \n The south considered their slaves human?\n \n Yeah thats why they tortured them, raped them and kept them as slaves to be bought and sold right?\n\n \n You've been watching too much of Roots. The events you mention were extremely rare. About 20% of the southerners were slave owners. 18% of the southerners had less than 3 slaves, and they were usually indoor (Not many abuse cases). Only 2% had more than that, which was considered a plantation, and that is where the abuse cases were a bit higher, although still not very high. I am not condoning slavery, I'm simply pointing out that the southern blame has been exaggerated. Sure, people were tortured, raped, et cetera, but they also dealt the same issues in the north.

Nor can it, upon any fair construction be applied to any property but that which the new government was about to receive from the confederated States.

   "If Slavery was the only issue of the civil war then why did the Union have 4 slave states and why did Lincoln not declare slavery illegal till midway into the civil war AND only in the confederacy which he didn't even control at the time ? \n \n Antitam was the turning point of the civil war and the bloodiest battle in US history, even though it was a battle that neither side won. Because the south didn't have a decisive victory at Antitam, England and France,who were supporting the confederacy, dropped their support for the south. They were going to send troops and their navy in support of the south prior to Antitam which would have insured a confederate victory. \n \n Antitam also caused, or allowed, Lincoln to enact the emancipation proclamation freeing slaves, although only in the south, not the north. Ironic, eh ? The main reason Lincoln issued the emancipation proclomation was because he wanted what every 1st term president wants; a second term. There were powerful abolitionist forces within his party looking to oust Lincoln who was NOT an abolitionist. \n \n Issuing the emancipation proclomation allowed Lincoln to keep his party in power in congress, the republicans, and insure his nomination in the 1864 election, basically pulling the rug out from under his republican opponent, John Fremont, an abolitionist and former Union General who Lincoln had reversed his order to free the slaves in Missouri, a union slave state, in 1861. \n \n Conservative forces in the north were outraged over the proclamation and there were riots in the streets of New York. After that, the union had massive numbers of draft resisters. People felt betrayed to learn they were fighting a war over slavery, an issue most weren't willing to die for or send their sons to die for. It was a decision Lincoln paid for with his life. After Lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation, his days on this earth were numbered whether he won or lost the war.\n \n The Democrats of that time, it should be noted, sought a cease fire with the south and a negotiated settlement.\n \n WHAT ? Lincoln wasn't an abolitionist ? No, he wasn't. \n \n The idea of abolishing slavery had been around for 100 years in America. Jefferson initially addressed the issue in the Constitution but was pressured to remove any mention of it in the Constitution, sending him to do a re-write.There were even abolitionist forces in the south. \n \n It's somewhat correct to say that the civil war was about slavery and about states rights. But it was more about states rights. Slavery was just the wrapper. Like I said, if slavery was the issue of the time, then why did Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri, all slave states, choose to join the union and not the confederacy ?\n \n The civil war is perhaps the most misunderstood most complex era of American history and has never been properly taught in schools. To quote a cliche'....\" The winners write the history books...\" The abolishment of slavery, I contend, was more a consequence of the civil war, than a cause.\n \n Sorry I missed the 7:00 deadline...... by a month.

   "avs, Lincoln didn't outlaw slavery immediately because he hoped to bring the south back into the Union with as little bloodshed as possible. Additonally, he had no desire to turn the war into a revolution, a feeling many of his generals shared. In the end, however, he had no choice but to initiate that revolution, hence the Emancipation Proclamation. Even then, the Emancipation Proclamation tried to entice the south to return. Notice the wording, that states not in rebellion would be allowed to keep their slaves. Thus, if Virginia returned to the Union in the months between the announcement of the proclamation and its enactment, it would be able to retain slavery as an institution.\n \n As for the northern slave states, Lincoln constantly pressured their state legislatures to enact compensated emancipation, but they refused. It should also be noted that the Union's strongest support in the border states came from those regions with the smallest slave populations. The secession conventions show a correlation between slave population and support for secession.\n \n Lincoln's goal was not to end slavery when he was elected. He wanted to limit its expansion, believing, like many Republicans, that the free market system would soon show slavery to be an obsolete method and the planters, facing increasing debts, would accept compensated emancipation and adopt the free labor ideology of the north. Of course, the southern planters panicked and we got the Civil War.",

   "Let me put it this way...\n \n If slavery was never an \"issue\", history would be very different. There never would have been any civil war, etc. etc. etc.\n \n Interpret that however you like. The fundamental difference between the north and south was their stance on the issue of slavery. True, most of the population were poor farmers, and did not own slaves, at least no more than a handful. However, the 2.5% of the population that did own slaves on massive plantations were the ones in power in government. They argued the issues for their own selfish benefit of their cause, not the good for the entire population. They are the ones who stirred the conflict that led to the divide of the north and south.\n \n Here is my opinion on why I think it was good slaveholders payed higher tarrifs. They were on the benefit of having \"free\" labor do all of their work and earn their revenue. So in a way, with the slaves being directly responsible for the revenues earned for the south, they should have been entitled to a large % of those earnings that they could pass on to their descendents. \n \n Then they had the nerve to want to add the slaves as part of their population for representation in voting for when it came to elections. Especially this was ridiculous since they had NO rights and were not even considered human beings. That's like me wanting to keep some of my tax money, so I claim my pets in the house as dependents to receive cuts.\n \n Those bastards in power of the south got what they had coming to them. not to mention how they treated their wives and trying to use genocide against the indians. They \"stole\" their land, and today people want to cry about property rights when the land they have in the first place was initially acquired by immoral methods.\n \n If someone wants to debate the issue, I'm armed and ready, lol.

Lincoln was no fool and he understood that preservation of the Union was his highest goal. When emancipation did not support that goal (1861-1862) when border states Maryland and Missouri were wavering on the issue of secession Lincoln was silent on emancipation. Following Confederate successes in 1862 foreign recognition of the Confederacy was the worst case scenario. Emancipation effectively kept Britain out of the war. The Emancipation Proclamation was essentially an empty document in that it freed: no one. The EP conferred freedom to slaves in Confederate States - those in which the US Government had no jurisdiction or control. Despite this, the proclamation allowed the US to proclaim moral high ground on an international stage for the benefit of Abolitionist Britain. \n \n Your vaunted treason trials would have likely drawn the South into Guerrila warfare to defend their leaders, their officers, and the shattered remains of their society. Moreover, no one in the North wanted the spectacle of a treason trial with the resultant stage that such a trial would give to the cause of secession. Instead, the North crushed the South with reconstruction, the after effects of which still linger along with the spectres of racism and regional mistrust. \n \n In your use of the term \"ignominious surrender\" you miss the fact that it took the greatest industrial nation 4 years to subjugate a rebellion of largely agrarian states. Such rebellion was only quieted after the loss of over 300,000 Northern soldiers. That the starving ranks of the Army of Northern Virginia were brought to bay and driven to surrender by a numerically superior foe is not ignominius, and no one who gathered there in the shadows of Appomattox would characterize the surrender so.",

According to records, the South (save South Carolina) constantly wrestled with slavery and how to free them. Notice I said [B]how[B], not if, the majority of Southerners except for the \"slaveocrats\" wanted to free them, the only problem is what to do with millions of newly freed slaves. They could free them gradually, like England did with serfdom, but that would take too long, in fact if England is the example they might still be freeing slaves today. They could have have decided to free them all at once, but what would happen to a group of mostly uneducated dolts running around. They could distribute them throughout the country, gradually but a lot faster than following England's lead, but many whites and blacks had become close, so they didn't want to simply say goodbye. Then the last possibility was to \"free\" them by simply saying they were no longer slaves but full citizens (as the North Carolina Supreme Court defined citizenship in 1838) but still obliged to till the lands as they always done, just with actual cash being paid instead of letting them keep a portion of the crops (as most masters did); the problem with that is that it would lead to the criticism that they hadn't changed the circumstances.\n \n So why would a state secede over something it was hoping to get rid of if the purpose was to protect it?

I suggest you look up newspaper accounts from the Richmond in January 1831 (or '32, it might be), I'm not sure if they're on the internet however. That time period represents the most intense moments in the debate in Virginia.\n \n Internet sources I've found on the subject tend to be biased towards the North because they won the war, so they get write the history everyone gets taught. Some sources I've found say there were 5x as many members of abolition societies in the South as opposed to the North.",

At Philadelphia in 1787, George Mason, a Virginian, led Virginia and the Southern States (except two of three of South Carolina's delegates) against the importation of slaves, then the CSA forbade the slave trade and made it the duty of Congress to prevent their importation. \n \n Also the CSA Constitution gave the Congress the authority to ban slaves in the territories. In late 1864, Davis sent a plan to the European powers to emancipate the slaves in exchange for recognition, but they rejected him because they believed it was already too late for a victory, even with their intervention.\n \n So why would the South fight for something it was willing to give up for freedom?",

People on the losing side of a war don't tend to realize until it's too late that they have no hope. \n \n This action just that the Southern people thought slavery was a secondary issue, one they were willing to give up for independence.\n \n If Southern opposition to slavery in the 1700's isn't enough, then their opposition later on should be acceptable. The Confederate Constitution bans the slave trade so that the institution could not expand so that later on the Southerners could more easily free their slaves. \n \n The cause of the war was twofold: the tariff that was probably going to be raised by Lincoln, then Lincoln's election because the South realized it had lost virtually all its power in the Federal Government. They decided that a rampant anti-Southern majority in Congress would hold their best interest at heart. \n \n Plus, in the failed Crittenden Compromises, their was an amendment to protect slavery, and the Southern States rejected it.",

   "Let me start this off by letting you know that I will not be calling the war between 1861 and 1865 the, \"civil war.\" To misuse a phrase on the subject I am replying on would contradict all the true statements I am here to make. The meaning of the term Civil War is two sections of ONE country fighting each other. It is usually used when one side, faction, or party within a nation fights another for control of the government or throne. \n Many, including southerners have used the term. But as you will learn from other facts I share, just because enough people agree on something doesn't make it truth. \n Some new age Southerns would like to call the war, the Second American Revolution. Even this is wrong. Revolution signifies change, a revolt of power. For example, when the colonies seceded from England, they did so illegally and against British law. However, the Southern states secession from the United States was a legal right bound by the same constitution that created the Union. There are several names that may correctly be used. The War for Confederate Independence, The War against Confederate Independence, The War to preserve Confederate Independence, the War to subjugate Confederate Independence. The War between the CSA and the USA. \n The war was not a Southern resistance against the Union goverment. In fact the Confederate States did not include a wish, reason, or need for war. The only reason Confederate soldiers fought was to keep the United States government and its military from invading their country and subjugating their independence. \n Many have yelped that it was the Confederacy who fired the first shot at Fort Sumter. Indeed. By April of 1861 the Confederate States of America was established as a free and independent nation. South Carolina was a member of this new union. In all fairness, The Confederacy and South Carolina was completely independent of the US goverment. So what should they have done about that ARMED foreign military post in the center of her busiest harbor?? \n How did the US feel about any sort of British occupation anywhere in the colonies, on land or on an island? How would the US feel if Iran armed and held onto Staten Island? Would the US just stand by just to avoid the burden of the opening shots? \n Many of you will say that Fort Sumter was a US military garrison and not owned by South Carolina. This was true until South Carolina seceded from the goverment that owned the fort. When South Carolina seceded from the US goverment, any US goverment installation should have packed up and left. Major Anderson, with the blessings of Lincoln, did not. South Carolina and the Confederacy viewed the OCCUPATION of Fort Sumter with weariness. Here was an armed foreign fort with guns pointed at one of your largest cities, a fort being refitted regularly. To protect her borders, the Confederacy had to flush out any unauthorized foreign force the same as any country would be compelled to do! Look at these issues without passion or emotion but through the eyes of how any leader or countryman would see it in the same situation. \n What did the Confederate States of America fight for? The Confederacy did not fight for anything. It fought against something. If anything, it fought for the right to be left alone! The Confederate's goal in the war was to push back every invader from beyond the soil of their country. It had already gained its independence through the legal actions of secession. The conflict was to keep out any intruder whether from the U.S. or some other hostile nation. One Confederate private summed it up best when asked why he fought. He said, \"Because your down here.\" \n The hundreds of thousands of white Confederates officers and enlistedmen alike did not fight to preserve slavery. The thousands of blacks who fought for the Confederacy certainly did not. And nor did the many thousands of Hispanic, Italian, Irish, German, Native American, and Polish Confederates either. To say that the Confederacy fought for its independence to preserve slavery would be no different from saying that the colonies fought for independence to preserve the institution. What you do not usually learn in the text books was that there were British officials who believed that the colonies were seceding on account of England's growing distaste towards slavery. I am confident that if the colonies had lost the revolution that generations today would read in their text books about that \"civil war,\" and how Washington and Jefferson seceded to protect slavery. \n Less than 6% of the South owned slaves before it seceded. In fact, years before the war, all the coastal Southern states had outlawed the slave trade (and was upheld in the Confederate States Constitution). The Northern states were far more reluctant to give the trade up for it was their merchants and vessels that profited the most from it. In fact the last known American slave trader lived and operated out of Portland, Maine. \n Many of you will say that the average Confederate was brainwashed by the rich and powerful to fight for a, \"lost cause.\" The average Confederate farmer and worker had no more love, faith, or trust for the upper crust society than most of us do today. In fact, for the most reclusive and poor Confederates, their state's separation from the U.S. did not feed a lot of passion into his heart. But when he learned that armies were being raised to invade the soils he has worked and created a family from, it was time to enlist. \n Many Confederates enlisted for the dual purpose to preserve the independence of their new country and to also keep any foreign army and navy from invading his home. Yet, for the majority of enlistedmen, again, it was to protect their families and homes by offering their small hand in its defense. \n There is one very very big contradiction to the fable that the Confederacy fought for and bled for the preservation of slavery. It is one that cannot possibly be argued. \n In 1861 the U.S. Congress with the approval of Lincoln set to pass an amendment in the constitution (the original 13th) that would secure and guarantee the right to enslave Africans from sea to shining sea. Days later four states (later that year two more) seceded from the government that promised that amendment. If the Southern states wanted slavery so bad that it would pay any cost including the deaths of hundreds of thousands and complete rune then why did these states not rejoin the Union to ensure the survival of slavery? The Southerner leaders knew that the North was bigger, with more factories, and citizens. What kind of cause would make them ignore those odds and continue until the last man? If somebody offered you a million bucks for free with no catch, would you decide to beat him up to take the money anyway? NO. \n The South was offered a chance to preserve slavery at the cost of its independence. For the Southern states, independence was their cause and no new amendment in the US constitution would provoke them to return to it. \n The North tried this tactic again in 1862. Lincoln alerted the South that any part of it that did not surrender its independence would be face abolition. This is why Lincoln only freed the slaves in the \"rebellious,\" territory of the South. The message was that if you choose peace with the US, slavery will not be touched there and those who continue the fight for independence, the US will regard abolition there. However, even with this second guarantee of the preservation of slavery, the South did not lay down its arms. \n These facts are clear, very clear. The North fought to keep the Southern States in the Union. The South fought to preserve its independence and to resist invasion. \n \n \"From the inception of the war, the people had generally and at all times expressed their determination to accept no terms of peace that did not recognize their independence.\"-Jefferson Davis\n \n The following quotes are from those characters who lived through this war. I imagine there will be those of you who may try to prove these previous facts wrong. Yet, your stand will be very meek if it dares to question the characters who fought that war on why they fought it. These quotes are from speeches but mostly private documents and journals. \n \"It is hopeless to correct the false impressions which have been created, but it seems to me both proper and due that the truth should be stated by those who alone know it.\"-Jefferson Davis\n To say that those who wrote these quotes were wrong about the issues of this war would be no different than me calling you a liar about something you did even though I wasn't there or knew anybody who was there at the time. \n \n \"The war was, on the part of the United States Government, one of aggression, and, on the part of the South, was for the defense of an inherent, unalienable right.\"-Jefferson Davis, President \n \n \"We feel that our cause is just and holy; we protest solemnly in the face of mankind that we desire peace at any sacrifice save that of honour and independence; we ask no conquest, no aggrandizement, no concession of any kind from the States with which we were lately confederated; all we ask is to be let alone; that those who never held power over us shall not now attempt our subjugation by arms.\"-Jefferson Davis\n \n \"If all living Union soldiers were summoned to the witness stand, every one of them would testify that it was the preservation of the American Union and not the destruction of slavery that induced him to volunteer at the call of his country.\"-Lt. General John Gordon\n \n Men of the South! shall our mothers, our wives, our daughters and our sisters, be thus outraged by the ruffianly soldiers of the North, to whom is given the right to treat, at their pleasure, the ladies of the South as common harlots? Arouse friends, and drive back from our soil, those infamous invaders of our homes and disturbers of our family ties.-General PGT Beauregard\n \n 'We are not fighting for slavery. We are fighting for independence.' 'The assertion that the South fought for slavery is Yankee propaganda and a monstrous distortion.\"-Jefferson Davis \n \n \"I overheard two negroes discussing affairs in general; they were deploring the war, and expressing their hatred of the yankees for bringing 'sufferment on us.'\"-Lt. Colonel Arthur J. L. Fremantle\n \n \"We [The South] desire, we beseech you [The North], let this parting be in peace...indulge in no vain delusion that duty or conscience imposes upon you the necessity of invading our States or shedding the blood of our people. -Judah Benjamin CS secretary of State\n \n \"The contest is realy for empire on the side of the North and for independence on that of the South.\" -London Times, November 7, 1861\n \n \"The victory in the War for Southern Independence has claimed, as part of his spoils, the right to record and enforce his point of view as the offical and accepted history of the war.' Southern history, as taught in our public and private schools today, is nothing more than a recitation of the North's justification for invasion, conquest, and oppression of the Southern people. \"-James Ronald and Walter Donald Kennedy\n \n \"It is stated in books and papers that Southern children read and study that all the blood shedding of that conflict was because the South rebelled without cause against the best government the world ever saw; that their leaders were rebels and traitors who fought to overthrow the Union, and to preserve human slavery. As a Confederate soldier and as a citizen of Virginia, I deny the charge, and denounce it as a calumny. We were not rebels; we did not fight to perpetuate human slavery, but for our rights and privileges under a government established over us by our fathers and in defense of our homes.\" -Richard Henry Lee, Confederate Colonel",

   "Sorry, too ridiculous to even warrant a serious answer.\n\n \n What is ridiculous about it? He only brings up legitimate facts that only Northerners attempt to uphold. Since you have stated that you are from Europe, I am afraid that you can only use comparisons from European Wars like World War II, but Americans as a whole aren't like Europeans. Americans and Southerners in particular, are rebellious and do not like even the slightest infraction what they believe to be their rights. You cannot compare a defeated South to a defeated Nazi, even in obscuring the truth. For one the two sides have absolutely nothing in common, the South believing in decentralized society, that avoids war unless attacked. The Nazis believing in a society devoid of anyone who isn't a \"good German\" having any power, highly centralized society that goes to war aggressively. The two sides have absolutely nothing in common, it cannot be argued that the Nazis did anything allowed by the German Constitution, yet the South believed their rights were being violated and they had no dsire to subjagate anyone else to their rule, only to be let alone and to determine how to eliminate their hypocrises on their own. They knew on the surface if someone looked at the dogmatic view that \"South had slaves, North didn't, North good, South bad\" that they looked bad, but you cannot just look at the salient facts about events, you almost always wind up with a bad outlook on history.\n \n For example:\n French Revolution: if you look at the surface: \"Monarchy likes autocracy, Revolutionaries like Republic/Democracy, Revolutionaries good, Monarchy bad\"\n Would anyone believe today that the French Revolutionaries were examples of how to run a Revolution, it was a bloodbath.\n \n American Revolution: \"British raise minimal taxes, Colonies don't like and rebel, Colonies bad, British good\" Would anyone believe that the Colonies were bad and the British were just putting down a mere tax revolt, it goes much deeper than that.\n \n English Civil War: \"Monarchy dissolves Parliament, Cromwell Parlimentarian, Cromwell good, Monarchy bad\" Would anyone think today that Cromwell was good.\n \n Russian Civil War: \"White Army wants Czar, Red Army wants socialist republic, Red Army good, White Army bad\" Look how the Red Army's dream turned out, and how close we came to vaporization.\n \n This logic is sometimes okay in relation to foreign wars, depending on your philosophy. Mostly when one party is the aggressor and has absolutely no reason to go to war, and one is merely defending her territory.",

   "My friends, do not disrespect yourself by replying to Tcap0 or any of the others who choose prejudice over fact. For it is the sadest of creatures who pass a judgment based on ignorance against those who fought and died to defend a sacred cause of devotion to family and country...\n I have read this thread closely. I find that those of you who claim the South was like Nazi Germany or that even my post was ridiculous \n do not: \n support your claim with any facts-\n use the constitution or declaration of independence as a source of your attacks against the legality of secession-\n use any quotes, accounts, or statements from any memoirs or writings by those who participated in the War for Confederate Independence. \n \n Your only points are-\n personal opinions-\n prejudice fueled by ignorance on the subject-\n a blind eye to the historical facts- \n \n Your personal opinions cannot change the fact that the Northern Armies waited two years before they allowed blacks to fight in their war. And then they were forced to serve in segregated units (a policy that continued until after World War II). The black soldiers in Northern armies were paid three dollars less a month than their white counterparts. They were not allowed to be commissioned officers. Lastly, the bulk of the black soldiers serving in the army were conscripts, plucked form the paths of the invading armies. \n \n Your personal opinions cannot change the fact that since the beginning of the war, Confederate armies included black fighting men...volunteers, not slaves. Some examples include the mostly black unit, the 1st Louisiana from New Orleans. Another includes the death of the first Union officer of the war, Major Winthrop. He was killed by a black Confederate sharp shooter at the battle of Big Bethel. \n \n Your personal opinions cannot change the fact that during the war and after the war many thousands of Native Americans were killed and slaughtered by troops led by Northern generals including Generals Sheridan, General Miles, Lt. Colonel Custer, General Crook, and General Sherman. (speaking of holocausts...)\n Your personal opinions and prejudice cannot change the fact that the highest ranking Native American officer in the War for Confederate Independence was Brig. General Stand Wati...of the Confederate Army. He and his men were also the last unit to surrender to the Union authorities at the close of the war. The Native Americans in the South were given the whole Indian Nation known today as Oklahoma. Several Native American tribes held seats in the Confederate Congress. \n Your personal opinions cannot change the fact that over fifty-thousand Confederates serving were Jews or that the Confederate Secretary of the War, Judah Benjamin was Jewish. (No United States cabinet member had ever been a Jew previous.) The Jewish population supported the Confederate cause of independence and this spirit of devotion was reflected in Judah Benjamin's last speech to the US Senate, \"You [The North] may carry desolation into our peaceful land, and with torch and fire you may set our cities in flame...you may do all this-and more too, if more there be-but you never can subjugate us; you never can convert the free sons of the soil into vassals, paying tribute to your power; NEVER! NEVER!\"\n \n Speaking of Nazi Germany and the prejudice that brought it fame I will share with you two statements from two very important Northern leaders that you may have heard of. \n \n \"The most active agents and most effective supporters of the Confederacy have been the same guasi-foreign houses..mostly Jews...who all deserve at the hands of the US Government what is due to the Jew.\"- Union General B. Butler\n \n \"I will say, then, that I am not, nor have ever been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races; that I am not nor ever been in favor of making voters of the free Negroes, or jurors, or qualifying them to hold office, or having them to marry with white people. I will say in addition, that there is a physical difference between the white and black races, which, I suppose, will forever forbid the two races living together upon terms of social and political equality, and inasmuch as they cannot so live, that while they do remain together, there must be the position of superior and inferior, that I as much as any other white man am in favor of the superior position being assigned to the white man.\"-President Abraham Lincoln.\n (How ironic it is that you use Hitler as an example for my side of this argument when the president of the side you defend has uttered those words...)\n \n You may call these facts ridicules as you please. But, what other word than ignorance should be used when somebody like you who believes your prejudice towards the South is more correct than the true history of the land?\n You may call this revisionist history. What kind of sense does that make? I am including personal and authentic reports and quotes from those men that lived this history and you are saying its a revision. Please prove your point. \n \n You compared the Confederates with Hitler's Nazis? Would Hitler's goons utter words such as these...?\n \n \"I came here as a friend...let us stand together. Although we differ in color, we should not differ in sentiment.\" -Confederate Lt. General Nathan Forrest\n \n \"It is said slavery is all we are fighting for. We deny. As between the loss of independence and the loss of slavery, we assume that every patriot will freely give up the latter.\" -Major General Patrick Cleburne, Confederate Army\n \n You say that the South was treasonous for supporting secession. \n If you stand by that opinion then you yourself is saying that Abraham Lincoln is also a traitor. For he spoke these words at a public speech ion January 12, 1848- \n \"Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up and shake off the existing government and form a new one that suits them better. This is a most valuable, a most sacred right.\"\n \n Wow, I bet you are mighty flustered. Your opinions do not match these facts that I share. I am sorry but the revisionist teachers and Hollywood movies that taught you what you now believe have betrayed you. They taught you lies. \n So I offer you all some advice. If you wish to learn the true history of the past, source your information only on data from that period...what was done, what was said, what was believed. It takes a lot of research. In reading your replies, I am confident you are not used to any type of research. Good luck. \n I personally believe that you do not research the true facts of the history of this time period and the men and women who lived it because you are AFRAID of what you might learn. Your choice of ego over truth is one of man's most dangerous habits. \n Do not source your material on writers and speakers from the modern world. That is as wild as trying to find memories from before you were born. Even worse, those who pass judgment on those of a completely different time bring no truth to the table. \n I say again. Seek history in history. Read memoirs. Research letters. If you want to find out if secession is legal, read the American Constitution and Declaration of Independence. I'll save you the time...the legality of it is in there. \n Do not ignore the thousands of authenticated records and photos of free black history of the Confederate army. Do not ignore what thousands of Southerners between 1861 and 1865 wrote for future generations to understand what caused them to sacrifice so much. \n Do not deny the truth. Ignorance is the only other option. That shirt fits some of you nicely. \n \n \"The truth, the whole truth, should be known, so that crimination and recrimination may for ever cease...\"-Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy\n \n \"Startling absense of truth and fact in many of the tales that stand forth as history.\" -Varina Davis, First Lady of the Confederacy",

The majority of Southerners prior to the abolition of slavery let slaves have a lot of free time, the slaves who lived with the average slaveholder were considered family, and the ones on large plantations lived nice lives, and many worked enough to gain their freedom. Before the War for Southern Independence visitors to the South were often amazed by the level in society that blacks were able to achieve, some slave owners were black (including the first legal slave owner in Virginia). Blacks lived and worked alongside whites with little complaint. Many blacks moved down South from the North because they couldn't find people who were willing to give them jobs because the workers wouldn't work alongside them, while Southerners wouldn't give a hoot if they were black or not.\n \n The laws you are referring to that pre-reconstruction governments enacted actually weren't that bad, they mostly had to do with the fact that they didn't want a bunch of people roaming the land, with no home. One law commonly enacted was a law to say that at the beginning of the year people had to get contracts to work and that they had to honor the contract until the end of the year. Eventually Jim Crow got out of hand as to put many blacks into poverty and then many Southerners began to turn to racism because of the rampant poverty that hit the land. The South did have many racists inside of it, but eventually they began to learn that their racism had no basis as they began to be lifted out of poverty because they now had the time to actually sit and think for a while instead of just a blame process. If the South was really as bad as the Nazis, then the racists would have held all the offices in the South and then they would have left the Union again and went about their slaughter, but that didn't happen, did it?",

   "Take it, I couldn't care less, just let my family and fellow conservatives living in those states decide to leave first.\n\n \n My reply to cap and the others who have IGNORED the truth and facts of history. I notice a dark and SAD trend among this thread. On one hand there are those of us who project that the South did not fight for slavery and that the South had a legal right to secede. Further more we produce these facts from legit sources rooted in research that took no small effort. \n \n On the other hand there are those who do not agree with facts. With no facts, truth, data, or sources of their own they bluster out sarcasm. They spew hate and ignorant charges against our culture and ancestry. There is no shame in these posts. There is no regard of the understanding of the giant task that it has taken people like me YEARS to collect and make sense of the most complicated period in American history. Instead they do not reply directly to the facts presented at their feet. Instead they change the subject, bring up new charges based on popular stereotype and ignorance. \n I have shared this thread with many of my collages and friends, all of whom have dedicated their lives to the preservation of our nation's heritage. \n I asked why not one of them replied to your blasts, contradictions, and hate. One of them, a professor at UMF replied, \"Since I waved good bye to my junior high school many years ago, I have since graduated from the immaturity that would dictate I reply to such comments.\" \n I decided not to let him know I was replying to you. \n I do not feel that I wasted my time in presenting the gems of research that were so dearly won over the years. I am confident that there was at least one brother or sister out there who chose to see it. I knew from the first that the object of most people's character is to cover their eyes to what they don't understand. The fear of learning that you are wrong. \n Ego and ignorance and no shortness of hate are all that you reply with. Whether you admit it or not, the truth towers high above the muck you throw. You cannot change the truth. You cannot beat it. It's there even when your eyes are closed. \n In all that I have taught you and all that you have refused to learn, the Southern Confederacy did not fight for or represent the preservation of slavery or racism. \n My quote from Nathan Bedford Forrest echoes my own, that though people may differ in color, we all share the same sediment towards truth and love. I am sorry, Mr. Forrest was not the racist emperor despite what you saw in the first moments of Forrest Gump ;-) When the KKK became a legacy of hate, he and his Confederate brothers left the group, praying it would dissolve. However, strong allegiances to the klan in NORTHERN STATES for example Indiana, Illinois, and Maine kept the dirty empire from extinguishing. These are facts...facts I can prove that you cannot prove against. So close your eyes and spew more hate. \n As for the alleged racist history of the South during the 1960s, none of you hypocrites and revisionists will dare recall the Boston race riot in the LATE 1970s involving the bussing of black children to white schools. None of you will sit down to think of the race riots during the 1960s in Detroit, LA, Washington, Chicago, ALL NORTHERN CITIES. The South was home to ONE such riot, Selma. \n Consider these facts or wallow in ignorance. I have a feeling you will chose the latter. It was once quoted, \"better to reign in hell rather than serve in Heaven,\" right? \n \n As for Cap's thoughts on a northwest secession. You hypocrite. As for your reference to the South as the 'slave states,' I am confident that the hundreds of thousands of immigrant children, women, and men forced to work eighteen hours a day seven days a week in the Northeast (or starve and be kicked to the cold street) or the millions of Native Americans forced into camps and reservations in the west would like to remind you where the TRUE slave states lay.",

   "Citing the founder of the Klan simply shows the depth of your depravity.\n \n Calling Forrest the founder of the Klan shows the depth of your sectarian ignorance. Forrest did not found the Klan. He was named an honorary Grand Dragon at the 1867 convention. By that time the Klan was over a year old. Having an organization confer an honor upon you is a far cry from founding said organization. \n \n In the Congressional investigation on Klan activities in 1871, the committee concluded that Forrest's involvement with the Klan was limited to trying to get it to disband. They determined there was no evidence that he had founded or led the Klan. (wikipedia)\n \n On July 5, 1875, Forrest became the first white man to speak to the Independent Order of Pole-Bearers Association, predecessor of the NAACP. In speech, he stated blacks had the right to vote for any candidates they wanted and that the role of blacks should be elevated. He ended the speech by kissing the cheek of one of the daughters of one of the Pole-Bearer members. (http://www.tennessee-scv.org/ForrestHistSociety/forrest_speech.html)\n \n Henry Wirz should have just been the first of scores to face justice for their treason.\n \n Along with those commandants of Yankee POW camps Elmira, PT Lookout, Johnson's Island, City Point, Etc who presided over equally deplorable prison conditions. Again. One name in a sea of evil North and South. \n \n James Meredith, the Little Rock Nine\n The North has had its share of segregation:\n \n In fact, there is more racial separation today in northern urban schools than there was a half century ago when the United States Supreme Court declared school segregation unconstitutional. The culprit is residential segregation. Much of this is due to the migration of white families from inner cities to suburban areas during the decades following the end of World War II. Part of this is also due to the ongoing legacy of racial ghettos established during the first half of the twentieth century through a variety of public and private actions intended to keep blacks and whites apart. And the Supreme Court's changing school desegregation jurisprudence has played a role as well. The result is that America's schools are steadily becoming more racially homogenous - North and South - particularly in large cities. http://www.wm.edu/news/?id=5438\n \n \n Plaquemines Parish, \n \n Don't know where you are going with this one. Katrina? \n \n Bull Connor\n \n Boss Tweed, No Irish Need Apply, New York Race Riots of 1863, 1969, etc...\n \n Emmett Till, Mickey Schwerner, Andrew Goodman, James Cheney,\n \n The South is the only place where folks have been attacked on the basis of race? Rodney King? Reginald Denney??? Shall we go down a list of those murdered within the borders of Northern and Southern States? I would be delighted to compare the murder rate of Atlanta vs Detroit. \n \n \n Jena, LA\n \n Watts, CA, DC 1968, Los Angeles 1992, New York City (repeatedly), Crown Heights, NY 1991, Cincinatti, OH 2001, Benton Harbor Michigan Riot of 2003...\n \n Jim Crow\n \n Although escaping to northern and midwestern cities did bring an end to the most overt forms of Jim Crow for southern blacks, the North was not a \"promised land,\" one completely free of racial strife. Many white city dwellers bitterly resented the influx of blacks, and violent race riots erupted all over the nation from 1890 to 1945. Major ones occurred in East St. Louis, Houston, Chicago, and Tulsa in the years 1917 through 1921. In nearly every case black people defended themselves and their families against roving mobs of white racists. (WIKI)\n \n the Klan\n \n At its peak in the early 1920s, the organization was active in numerous cities of the Midwest and far west as well as the South, such as Detroit, Chicago, Indianapolis, Portland, Denver, Atlanta, Memphis and Knoxville, and Dallas. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan#_note-1. \n \n The Klan, like Racism in general was not confined by borders. \n \n While you are calling treasonous those proponents of secession You might also consider the words of this gentleman who recognized the legality of secession:\n \n The fact is the constitution did not apply to any such contingency as the one existing from 1861 to 1865. Its framers never dreamed of such a contingency occurring. If they had foreseen it, the probabilities are they would have sanctioned the right of a State or States to withdraw rather than that there should be war between brothers. \n --General US Grant Personal Memoirs Chapter 16.\n \n Slavery as an institution was confined to the elite of Southern aristocracy. A slave might cost $1,000 in 1862. A private in the Confederate Army earned $11.00/ month. In light of the economics it is not hard to understand why fewer than 2% of Southern soldiers were slave owners. Extrapolated to 2007 dollars, the Slave would represent an investment of approximately $250,000. Why would the other 98% of Southern soldiers fight to preserve an institution that they could never hope to be participants in? Why would they struggle for 4.5 years for the property of the rich?\n \n \"If you are going to be underestimated by people who speak more rapidly, the temptation is to speak slowly and strategically and outwit them.\"\n \n ----Doris Betts, on the Southern drawl",

Most of the Negroes had arms, rifles, muskets, sabers, bowie-knives, dirks, etc.....and were manifestly an integral portion of the Southern Confederate Army.\"\n - Dr. Lewis Steiner, Chief Inspector of the United States Sanitary Commission, 1862 \n \n The first Federal officer casualty of the Civil War was Major Theodore Winthrop. He was killed at the battle of Big Bethel by a black Confederate of the 1st North Carolina. June 10, 1861\n \n \"There are at the present moment many colored men in the Confederate Army - as real soldiers, having muskets on their shoulders, and bullets in their pockets, ready to shoot down loyal troops, and do all that soldiers may do to destroy the Federal government...There were such soldiers at Manassas and they are probably there still.\" -Frederick Douglass, Douglass' Monthly, IV [Sept. 1861,] pp 516 \n \n NOTICE that the event Dr. Lewis Steiner witnessed and the observation Frederick Douglass wrote of, and the killing of the first officer of the war by a black Confederate all happened LONG BEFORE the North first started accepting African Americans into their army.  \n \n This is not revision...these are facts. You may dishonor the memory of the black Confederates by calling them uncle toms just as you have so eloquently attempted to dishonor any Confederate history. But the facts stand my case. You are a poor judge of character for your character is very poor itself.",

   "Grant, Sherman, and Farragut backed it well enough for rational people.\n \n For further proof, see any standard reference work on the traitor Lee's surrender to lawful authority in the person of Gen. Grant.\n \n The self-same Grant who argued the constitutional legality of secession? Since you failed to respond to it the first time, here is Gen Grant in his own words:\n \n The fact is the constitution did not apply to any such contingency as the one existing from 1861 to 1865. Its framers never dreamed of such a contingency occurring. If they had foreseen it, the probabilities are they would have sanctioned the right of a State or States to withdraw rather than that there should be war between brothers. \n --General US Grant Personal Memoirs Chapter 16.\n \n We will revisit the words of General Grant at the end of this post to see how his own words refute your arguments. \n \n Gee, d'ya think you could find a single instance of US Government troops murdering the troops of the enmy(sic) who had already surrendered and laid down their arms?\n \n \n Burke Davis, Sherman's March, Pg 218, Random House, 1980:\n \n General Howard came up a few minutes later to report that his troops were still under fire from rebel sharpshooters. He thought the snipers were from Texas. \n \n \"Then shoot some Texas prisoners,\" Sherman said.\n \"We've got no Texans.\"\n \"Then shoot others, any prisoners.\"\n \n Example provided. Your original point remains a mystery. Sherman shooting prisoners does not make Ft. Pillow less of an atrocity and Ft. Pillow does not make Sherman's actions less an atrocity. \n \n Sherman, long may he be praised, did nothing more than to destroy the traitors' ability to wage war, nothing more than the bombing the oil fields at Ploesti or of a German ball bearing factory.\n \n Or the Confederates at Ft. Pillow? An atrocity is an atrocity regardless of the color of the uniform. While I seem capable of recognizing an atrocity, you seem capable of rationalizing them away as long as it is \"your side\" doing the dirty work.\n \n If the civilians had wanted to avoid being the instuments (sic) of their own destruction, all they had to do was cease feeding the traitors.\n \n You're also morally warped if you cannot tell the difference between the massacre of unarmed troops who have surrendered and those who aided and abetted treason.\n \n Indeed, the former is bad, the latter is far worse. All one need do is claim that women and children are \"feeding the traitors\" and you are excused from any conduct? This line of argument is rather chilling.\n \n In a war replete with atrocities it is rather childish to hold up one example as absolute truth. Rather than prove your point this tactic coupled with your slavish devotion to ad hominem shows the vacuity of your position. Your tactic heretofore has consisted of the following debate equation:\n \n (single example) + Propaganda = justification for action against nation/region/people. \n \n Regardless, it is clear that you will persist in your little rant untainted by facts, references or citations. You are quite content to hurl stones from your little house of dogma. As Abraham Lincoln noted \"When you have got an elephant by the hind legs and he is trying to run away, it's best to let him run\".\n \n So run, preferably to a library. The application of some meager study of the course of the war may temper your rather uneducated and ill-mannered views. You would benefit from a reading of Reminisces of the Civil War by John B. Gordon, MG, CSA. In Chapter One of said Reminisces, the General muses on those who hold up blind views of history as you espouse. General Gordon provides a far more eloquent riposte to you than I could hope to muster:\n \n  There were those, a few years ago, who were especially devoted to the somewhat stereotyped phrase that in our Civil War one side (meaning the North) \"was wholly and eternally right,\" while the other side (meaning the South) \"was wholly and eternally wrong.\" I might cite those on the Southern side of the great controversy, equally sincere and fully as able, who would have been glad to persuade posterity that the North was \"wholly and eternally wrong\"; that her people waged war upon sister States who sought peacefully to set up a homogeneous government, and meditated no wrong or warfare upon the remaining sister States. These Southern leaders steadfastly maintained that the Southern people, in the exercise of the freedom and sovereign rights purchased by Revolutionary blood, were asserting a second independence according to the teachings and example of their fathers. \n But what good is to come to the country from partisan utterances on either side? My own well-considered and long-entertained opinion, my settled and profound conviction, the correctness of which the future will vindicate, is this: that the one thing which is \"wholly and eternally wrong\" is the effort of so-called statesmen to inject one-sided and jaundiced sentiments into the youth of the country in either section. Such sentiments are neither consistent with the truth of history, nor conducive to the future welfare and unity of the Republic. The assumption on either side of all the righteousness and all the truth would produce a belittling arrogance, and an offensive intolerance of the opposing section; or, if either section could be persuaded that it was \"wholly and eternally wrong,\" it would inevitably destroy the self-respect and manhood of its people. A far broader, more truthful, and statesmanlike view was presented by the Hon. A. E. Stevenson, of Illinois, then Vice-President of the United States, in his opening remarks as presiding officer at the dedication of the National Park at Chickamauga. In perfect accord with the sentiment of the occasion and the spirit which led to the establishment of this park as a bond of national brotherhood, Mr. Stevenson said: \"Here, in the dread tribunal of last resort, valor contended against valor. Here brave men struggled and died for the right as God gave them to see the right.\" \n Mr. Stevenson was right -- \" wholly and eternally right.\" Truth, justice, and patriotism unite in proclaiming that both sides fought and suffered for liberty as bequeathed by the Fathers--the one for liberty in the union of the States, the other for liberty in the independence of the States. \n While the object of these papers is to record my personal reminiscences and to perpetuate incidents illustrative of the character of the American soldier, whether he fought on the one side or the other, I am also moved to write by what I conceive to be a still higher aim; and that is to point out, if I can, the common ground on which all may stand; where justification of one section does not require or imply condemnation of the other--the broad, high, sunlit middle ground where fact meets fact, argument confronts argument, and truth is balanced against truth.\n \n MG Gordon was the General given the task of surrendering the COnfederate forces at Appomattox. The General to whom he made the surrender was Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain of Maine. General Chamberlain displayed none of your hateful invective. Rather he recalled the occasion in his biography \"Bayonet Forward\". I quote:\n \n On they come, with the old swinging route step and swaying battle flags. In the van, the proud Confederate ensign. Before us in proud humiliation stood the embodiment of manhood; men whom neither toils and sufferings, nor the fact of death could bend from their resolve; standing before us now, thin, worn, and famished, but erect, and with eyes looking level into ours, waking memories that bound us together as no other bond; was not such manhood to be welcomed back into a Union so tested and assured? On our part not a sound of trumpet more, nor roll of drum; not a cheer, nor word, nor whisper or vain-glorying, nor motion of man, but an awed stillness rather, and breath-holding, as if it were the passing of the dead!\n \n Here now we have read the opinions of two adversaries who for four years fought one another. Neither of which espouses the views you advance. Your view is not supported by General Grant's estimation of history. I wonder then how you can continue to advance unsupported your view in sharp contrast to those who fought in that great conflict.\n \n see any standard reference work on the traitor Lee's surrender to lawful authority in the person of Gen. Grant.\n \n To close the book on your infantile rant, let us see how the lawful authority of Gen. Grant precluded the treason trials you advocate. The terms of the paroles of the Army of Northern Virginia and the subsequent surrender of the Army of Tennessee to General Shermna forbid such trials. Refer to the testimony of US Grant before the US Judiciary committee 18 July 1867. You may peruse a copy of this testimony in The Political History of the United States During Reconstruction, by historian Edward McPherson. I quote:\n \n Q: You looked on that in the nature of a parole and held that they could only be tried when they violated that parole?\n A: Yes that was the view I took of the question.\n Q: Did you understand that to apply to General Lee\n A: Certainly\n Q: That was your understanding of the arrangements you made with General Lee?\n A: That was my understanding of an arrangement which I gave voluntarily. General Lee's army was the first to surrender, and I believed that with such terms the rebel armies would surrender and we would thus avoid bush-whacking and a continuation of the war in a way that we could make very little progress with having no organized armies to meet. \n \n So you see sir, you cannot claim the lawful authority of Gen. Grant on the one hand and call for the treason trial of Lee and other Confederates as the lawful authority of Gen. Grant forbade them. General Grant admitted this in his testimony one hundred forty years ago. To persist in calling for said trials reveals a complete ignorance of history at best and an irrational hatred at worst.",

You have not heard the opinions of liberal politicans content to destroy your symbols rather than addressing pivital issues.\"\n \n You ignore this...\n \"Mr. Davis, said, \"We are not fighting for slavery; we are fighting for independence.\" \n This is true; and is a truth that has not sufficiently been dwelt upon enough.\n The sentiment is true, and should be publicly uttered and kept conspicuously in view; because our enemies have diligently labored to make all mankind believe that the people of these States real object has been only to preserve to themselves the property in so many negroes, worth so many millions of dollars. \n The direct reverse is the truth. \n The cause of the war, the whole cause, on our part, is the maintenance of the sovereign independence of these States.... \n The whole cause of our resistance was and is, the pretension and full determination of the Northern States to use their preponderance in the Federal representation, in order to govern the Southern States for their profit. \n The tariff... would have much more accurately represented, though it did not cover, or exhaust, the real cause of the quarrel. \n Yet neither tariffs nor slavery, nor both together, could ever have been truly called the cause of the secession and the war.

It is right to let foreign nations, and \"those whom it may concern,\" understand this theory of our independence. Let them understand that, though we are \"not fighting for slavery,\" we will not allow ourselves to be dictated to in regard to slavery or any other of our internal affairs, not because thatwould diminish our interest in any property, but because it touches our independence.\" \n -Richmond Examiner, August 2, 1864",

   "The war was started by one thing only: the federal government's claim of national authority over all of the states. Without this claim, none would have supported federal efforts to enforce it.\n \n And this claim was made by Lincoln, in deliberate act to force the war.\n \n When the states declared independence in 1776, they did so as 13 sovereign peoples-- i.e. sovereignty existed in the people of each state, not the state's government as a corporate entity, or its officials; Jefferson was 100% clear about this.\n \n This sovereignty was retained under the Articles of Confederation in 1781, and was thereafter recognized by Great Britain in 1783 via the Paris Peace Treaty, which granted the terms of the Declaration of Independence. \n \n When the states ratified the Constitution, they did not transfer their sovereignty to create one sovereign people, or legal \"nation,\" as revisionist history claims; rather, they simply delegated different powers to the federal government under the Constitution, than they had previously to the confederate government via the Articles of Confederation. \n Nothing in the Constitution even mentions the soveregnty of any state-- which must therefore remain unchanged; the Preamble-phrase \"We the People\" cannot even logically connote any body but the Peoples of the states respectively, since that was the only sovereign \"People\" that existed prior to the Constitution,  in order to so \"ordain and establish\" it: otherwise, a chicken cannot lay the same egg it hatched from, i.e. the Constitution cannot have created the same singular \"People\" that created and ratified the Constitution.\n \n Lincoln even recognized this, when he based his legal claims on false statements of history which have long since been retracted by all authorities: i.e. his allegations that \"the Union is older than the states.\" \n This was the entire basis for Lincoln's denial of secession-- as he stated in his Special Address to Congress on July 4, 1861: \n \"Having never been States, either in substance or in name, outside of the Union, whence this magical omnipotence of 'state rights,' asserting a claim of power to lawfully destroy the Union itself?\" \n \n In other words, if they had been states outside of the Union, then they would have such rights: for here he implicitly recognizes that they had never surrendered themselves to the Union from outside of it.\n \n By trumping up such authority, which Lincoln claimed only once about 4 years earler-- during a stump-speech in Galena, IL. when he was already campaigning for that office-- but he had likewise challenged the Southern states that the Supreme Court was the final word on the constitutionality of any law; thus Lincoln clearly intended to use force against secession from the beginning, and did not decide this only long afterward. Likewise, Lincoln accused the South of being \"disunionist\" if they did not submit to the Supreme Court's decision, when it came out.\n \n Now that he was in office, however, Lincoln denounced this Supreme Court's power of judicial review, stating that the Court's power pertained only to the cases that came before it-- not to the constitutionality of the law itself. Therefore it was Lincoln that was \"disunionist,\" by his own admission.\n \n Lincoln likewise deliberately abstained from calling Congress into emergency session, despite the fact that South Carolina had seceded over 70 days prior to his taking office. Lincoln therefore had a Constitutional duty to inform then-president Buchanan of his intent to call Congress into session upon his assuming office, in order that they would be present to act appropriately in response to his intentions.\n However, Lincoln clearly sought to usurp congressional power through deliberate act of omission-- just as he usurped the Supreme Court's power by denying their power of judicial review, as well as their right to grant writs of habeas corpus when Congress had not suspended it.\n \n Lincoln was therefore able to act unhindered in unilaterally both ordering acts of military aggression against the seceding states, and suspending habeas corpus in order to imprison anyone who failed to help him in this effort.\n \n In conclusion, it's clear that the war was caused by one thing: Lincoln, through an elaborate and underhanded political scheme on his part.",

In fact the SC explicitly states such.\n\n \n And the sovereign authority of the state-- i.e. its People, which is the supreme sovereign authority of that state-- may construe that, or any other law, as it pleases regarding its domestic policy.\n \n The SC can explicitly state that the world is flat; but that doesn't make it so, since it has no such power over heaven and earth; and it likewise has no power to grant or deny the international sovereignty of states.\n It may rule on cases that come before it, and pass them into subordinate case-law; however this cannot affect the actual sovereignty of the states in question, any more than it can make the Earth flat, or make England and France into the 51st and 52nd states.\n \n \nThe fact remains that the traitorous South committed the Article 3 definition of treason when Joel R. Poinsett fired the first shot at Sumpter, Southern apologists notwithstanding.\n\n \n It's actually spelled \"Sumter;\" and a sovereign authority-- in this case the People of a State-- cannot commit \"treason\" against its supreme national authority, since it IS the supreme national authority over the state in question. \n \n \"Treason\" would only apply to state-minorities of individuals engaged in an actual war against the Union-- not the majority of a state's People acting in a sovereign capacity to preserve their absolute sovereignty, against illegal conquest by upstart thugs who simply claimed it didn't exist-- and who stated false arguments in support of such (i.e. \"no state was ever out of the Union, which is older than the states\" etc).\n \n Likewise, Lincoln-apologists notwithstanding, no amount of firepower could make that so-- since it was an issue of fact pre-dating the incident. \n And NO ONE has power over historical facts-- just suppression thereof, through systematized suppression of truth.",

Moreover, it makes clear that a state may be bound by a federal constitutional amendment even if that state votes against the amendment in a properly convened state convention. And this rule is flatly inconsistent with the idea that states remain sovereign after joining the Constitution, even if they were sovereign before joining it.\n Thus, ratification of the Constitution itself marked the moment when previously sovereign states gave up their sovereignty and legal independence.\"\n \n Here, Amar believes that a state's sovereignty derives from simple bureacratic autonomy of its government, rather than the supreme sanctity of its People. \n Therefore, while the Constitution may have re-delegated more power to the federal government than did the Articles of Confederation, Amar falsely conflates this as absolute surrender of actual sovereignty, by the People of the states themselves-- simply because of the change of amendment-system from unanimity, to super-majority-- while he ignores outright, that the states retained their popular sovereignty. \n \n Rather, Amar defies the entire premise of popular sovereignty, i.e. that the People of a state are its ruling sovereigns-and that they therefore must remain such, unless and until they expressly name different persons as such.\n \n However the Constitution nowhere manifests any such an intention, and hence may not be construed to diminish the sovereignty of any state. On the contrary, each and every state-- vis-a-vis its People, rather than its government-must remain fully sovereign; and therefore they may be thus \"bound\" by the Constitution, only as it pleases that People, in that all government-state, federal or otherwise, is simply their delegated servant, as they have chosen to establish such by mutual agreement among themselves as self-governing individuals.\n \n In conclusion, therefore, Amar is wholly erroneous in both his claim of national government, and his defense of Lincoln based thereupon; therefore, barring any valid similar claim of national authority, the citizens of each respective state must jointly resume their full sovereignty as free nations of the world.",

It's like saying that if Bill Gates gave more power to the national manager of Microsoft than a local manager, then he thereby gave up ownership of the corporation.\n Of course that's absurd-- and therefore, so is Amar's claim. The Constitution is simply law, and ALL law is wholly subject to the sovereign power that construes it-- and that sovereign power is the people of the individual states, not the federal government or population.",

I am STILL curious about some aspects of the dialogue here itt. \n \n It seems to me, people in these questionably United States are STILL involved in a \"Cold\" Civil War about some of these questions. Case in point? We are STILL discussing the causes, factors, consequences, et cetera. The American Civil War was one of the most horrific wars in USA history & its legacy includes social, political, economic & even more issues that seem to continue to effect us today.\n \n It was interesting reading through all the pages of this thread. Especially insightful were the discussion points back & forth that led to a distinction\n between the difference in meaning between the words \"cause\" & \"factor.\" Some might say this is more semantics than true agreement, but for me, that was an interesting point. I guess, what I am trying to say here, I thought it was interesting to see the discussion go on for many more pages & it STILL does not seem to be settled in a lot of peoples' minds. We are STILL discussing the causes, factors, consequences, et cetera.\n \n I began to think more about how I came to my particular point of view & why I felt satisfied with some of the conclusions reached here. I'm third generation American & received most of my education in NYUSA. The way I remember learning about the American Civil War was kind of how it is presented here:\n \n \nCauses of the Civil War: A Balanced Answer\n by Gordon Leidner of Great American History\n \n What caused the American Civil War? It is amazing that even today, nearly 150 years after the Civil War started, there is passionate debate regarding the \"cause\" of the Civil War. Consider this:\n ...\n (the rest is here. Please note: currently unable to post a link because of my post count)\n\n \n This is pretty much what I remember being taught with the exception of this statement, \"Although the majority of the American people-- including many \n moderate politicians like Abraham Lincoln--wanted to avoid Civil War and were content to allow slavery to die a slow, inevitable death, the most influential political leaders of the day were not.\" I don't think we were taught that it was inevitable that slavery would have died out without the war. I honestly don't remember that part. I like to think that (in my high school days) I would have questioned that part. Did it seem inevitable that slavery would have ended? How would that have been accomplished?\n \n I never thought too much about the American Civil War after my formal education ended. It wasn't a hobby or a compelling topic of interest for me. My interest in the American Civil War was sparked again when I lived for a time in the Southern US. I had never even heard of Civil War re-enactments & it sort of amazed me at first. Living in the Southern US, I found myself listening to & reading about different perspectives, perceptions & frameworks that I had not previously considered. What struck me most though was those re-enactments. It made me think about the concept of Presentism. \n \n \nPresentism is a mode of historical analysis in which present-day ideas and perspectives are anachronistically introduced into depictions or interpretations of the past. Some modern historians seek to avoid presentism in their work because they believe it creates a distorted understanding of their subject matter.\n \n The Oxford English Dictionary gives the first citation for presentism in its historiographic sense from 1916, and the word may have been in use in this \n meaning as early as the 1870s. Historian David Hackett Fischer identifies presentism as a logical fallacy also known as the \"fallacy of nunc pro tunc\". He has written that the \"classic example\" of presentism was the so-called \"Whig history\", in which certain eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British historians wrote history in a way that used the past to validate their own political beliefs. This interpretation was presentist because it did not depict the past in objective historical context, but instead viewed history only through the lens of contemporary Whig beliefs. In this kind of approach, which emphasizes the relevance of history to the present, things which do not seem relevant receive little attention, resulting in a misleading portrayal of the past. \"Whig history\" or \"whiggishness\" are often used as synonyms for presentism, particularly when the historical depiction in question is teleological or triumphalist. (Please note: can't link)\n\n \n What is the relationship between the concept of presentism & history? Wouldn't most or all history be revisionist history, only differing in degree? \n \n What would be the reason or motivation to \"censor out\" or diminish the importance of slavery as a cause or factor in these discussions?\n \n As soon as the Constitution was put into place, the very people who helped to write it & put it into place began to have disagreements about its meaning. Fortunately, there was also a mechanism put into place to change through process things that no longer worked as people & times changed. People then & now STILL use the Constitution to serve their ends & dismiss it just as easily when it doesn't.\n \n Then I started to think about perception. Is perception a projection of bias?\n \n What about denial & self-justification? \n \n How are these concepts related to our continuing interest in the American Civil War? The fact is we, as a people, are STILL discussing the causes, factors, consequences, et cetera.\n \n Let's face it, back then, racist belief systems were not confined to any one area of the USA. Racist views were a national problem, not a regional one. Academic scholars today do not make claims based on one region of the country being uniquely racist. It seems more likely the majority of people back then held racist beliefs. Why do some people today seem to insist it was one region or another that was uniquely racist? I mean the double standard that looks to find historical justifications for one person or one region to be remembered as war criminals & for another person or region to be operating under more purely humanist ideals just seems unreasonable to me. I think it also highlights the problems inherent to a presentist type of history that \"uses the past to validate present beliefs.\" \n \n Thinking about all of these things made me think about two pretty common expressions, \"It is possible to learn from your mistakes,\" & \"The people who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\" I think they fit into a large area of thinking called \"common sense.\" A big obstacle to learning from mistakes or from history in general is denial & self-justification. Is it possible to learn from one's mistakes if one doesn't admit to making any? & the problems seem to multiply exponentially when a nation or country continues to do this. \n \n Is it possible to learn from this segment of American history? HAVE we learned anything?\n \n (Thanks for reading & I would greatly appreciate any insights into these questions.) :)",

   "Whatever the cause, the irony of this war was that the South had the constitutional right to succeed from the Union and they followed the correct procedure to the \"T\". The North violated the constitution by failing to recognize the sovereignty of the Confederate States of America and removing their troops from Ft. Sumter. The North's main concern about losing the South was not so much the slavery issue but \n rather the economic loss of the cotton revenue as well as other agricultural revenue of the South. \"Thomas Jefferson described the Tenth Amendment, which was states rights, as 'the foundation of the Constitution' and added, 'to take a single step beyond the boundaries thus specially drawn is to take possession of a boundless field of power, no longer susceptible of any definition.' Jefferson's formulation of this doctrine of &#8220;strict construction\" was echoed by champions of state sovereignty for many decades.\"\n \n Many people make great sweeping generalizations of the War of Northern Aggression. For the record Old Glory was as much a slave flag as the Stars and Bars... The USA was founded with slavery being legal. So it annoys me when people say we were the evil slavery movement. Also, 50,000 free blacks fought for the South during the war. it really burns me when some lefties start wailing and moaning about Confederate statutes, display of the flag or the playing of Dixie. Many are surprised about the concept of black Confederate soldiers. \n \n There is very little different from the \"Revolutionary\" and \"Civil\" wars ... both were attempts by smaller units of government to break away from its parent state's authority. The USA seceded from the country of Britain, and the CSA seceded from the USA. New England discussed secession long before the south did. I've even read speeches by Lincoln from his days in the Illinois legislature where he supports the right of secession. I do not believe in the \"cult of personality\" surrounding Lincoln, and do not believe that \"might makes right.\" (excerpts from http://www.allmilitary.com/board/viewtopic.php?id=2117)\n \n Saying that Federalism won out over state's rights because of the outcome of the war is ridiculous - did opposition to Vietnam end after Kent state? Did Ghandi stopping his demonstrations and protests when the British jailed him and beat his followers? That kind of thinking reasons that a playground bully is perpetually right since he can just go pound the dickens out of the kids that he doesn't like.\n \n \"Saving the Union\" was hogwash - a country that has to pin down half of its people and territory with bayonets needs to re-examine their morals. Britain could have \"saved the union\" with its colonies... but sometimes a people previously associated with a larger unit desire greater self government (happens all the time in every corner of the globe). I think an independent CSA and its neighbor USA could have co-existed peacefully had a peace been successful.\n \n Given the massive federal deficits today, possibly it would have been a good thing had the south actually been left along in self governance.

There is no constitutional right when your protecting your main source of income which is enslaving people...\n \n \n \n The North's main concern about losing the South was not so much the slavery issue but \n rather the economic loss of the cotton revenue as well as other agricultural revenue of the South. \"Thomas Jefferson described the Tenth Amendment, which was states rights, as 'the foundation of the Constitution' and added, 'to take a single step beyond the boundaries thus specially drawn is to take possession of a boundless field of power, no longer susceptible of any definition.' Jefferson's formulation of this doctrine of \"strict construction\" was echoed by champions of state sovereignty for many decades.\"\n\n \n The Southern Economy was BUILT upon the slave trade.... You could not have a southern economy without slaves period. \n \n \n Many people make great sweeping generalizations of the War of Northern Aggression. For the record Old Glory was as much a slave flag as the Stars and Bars... The USA was founded with slavery being legal. \n\n \n The USA was also almost torn apart during the constitutional convention and the drafting of the deceleration because many wanted to abolish slavery at the time. However the southern colonies refused to be apart of any united states without their main economical source intact....\n \n \n \n So it annoys me when people say we were the evil slavery movement. Also, 50,000 free blacks fought for the South during the war. it really burns me when some lefties start wailing and moaning about Confederate statutes, display of the flag or the playing of Dixie. Many are surprised about the concept of black Confederate soldiers. \n\n \n Yes and many are mad at the years of reconstruction where blacks were terrorized and murdered by the thousands and were forced to work on land still owned by their masters. \n \n And many are mad at the New Orleans Massacre, and also out of the seeds of hate that grew into the Klan..... Stop defending or whitewashing the blood stained history the South had upon this nation.... \n \n \nThere is very little different from the \"Revolutionary\" and \"Civil\" wars ... both were attempts by smaller units of government to break away from its parent state's authority. The USA seceded from the country of Britain, and the CSA seceded from the USA. New England discussed secession long before the south did. \n\n \n Bull. The USA sought independence due to taxation without representation and for individual liberty. The South seceded to protect it's economic interests and it's rule over the lives of other human beings...\n \n \n I've even read speeches by Lincoln from his days in the Illinois legislature where he supports the right of secession. I do not believe in the \"cult of personality\" surrounding Lincoln, and do not believe that \"might makes right.\" (excerpts from Why Did America Have a Civil War? - All Military)\n\n \n And I read the emancipation proclamation. No he was not a radical republican but still the idea of slavery was that is should be abolished...\n \n \nSaying that Federalism won out over state's rights because of the outcome of the war is ridiculous - did opposition to Vietnam end after Kent state? \n\n \n No but attempting to justify the South and it's actions is ridiculous...\n \n \n \nDid Ghandi stopping his demonstrations and protests when the British jailed him and beat his followers? That kind of thinking reasons that a playground bully is perpetually right since he can just go pound the dickens out of the kids that he doesn't like.\n\n \n No but Ghandi did not enslave thousands, beat and murder people who were treated like dogs, and did not exploit their misery for their own economic gain either....\n \n \n \n\"Saving the Union\" was hogwash - a country that has to pin down half of its people and territory with bayonets needs to re-examine their morals. Britain could have \"saved the union\" with its colonies... but sometimes a people previously associated with a larger unit desire greater self government (happens all the time in every corner of the globe). I think an independent CSA and its neighbor USA could have co-existed peacefully had a peace been successful.\n\n \n Yes and blacks would still be in chains to this day in suffering and misery..... You attempt to brush the blood stained history of the South under the rug and it's sickening.\n \n \nGiven the massive federal deficits today, possibly it would have been a good thing had the south actually been left along in self governance. Can it be that the United States of America is foundering under its own weight?.\n\n \n No but I believe it is possible that you could be a secessionist. And I do believe you refuse to acknowledge the crimes the South committed toward other human beings. And I also believe and find the confederate flag to be offensive and a direct contradiction to what the USA stands for....",

   "I can't believe people actually think it's even remotely possible the civil war wasn't about slavery.\n \n Why in the world would the confederacy form, at the exact same time as lincoln (the man who made is abolitionist viewpoint well known) was elected, after decades of political standoff of the issue.\n \n The federal government asserted it self a dozen times before and hundreds of times since on the states, only the assertion of emancipation roused the south to war.\n \n Political inference should be sufficient there is so much of it in this case.\n \n The idea that the south was mistaken in branding Lincoln an abolitionist is madness.\n \n The idea that the south didn't find that unacceptable is even more preposterous.\n \n \"As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy. \"\n \n \"You say you will not fight to free negroes. Some of them seem willing to fight for you; but, no matter. Fight you, then exclusively to save the Union.\"\n \n This second implies that he expects them to fight to free the negroes, for one does not make an exception to the norm.\n \n \"I have always hated slavery, I think as much as any Abolitionist.\"\n \n \"We are in civil war. In such cases there always is a main question; but in this case that question is a perplexing compound -- Union and Slavery. It thus becomes a question not of two sides merely, but of at least four sides, even among those who are for the Union, saying nothing of those who are against it.\"\n \n This may be the question for the north, but the question was one sided for the south, slavery or not.\n \n Or am I to hear now that the confederacy would have formed for no reason?\n \n \n This from the corner stone speech illustrates perfectly that it was in fact states rights that were being fought for, a states right to have legal slavery:\n \n \"But not to be tedious in enumerating the numerous changes for the better, allow me to allude to one other -- though last, not least. The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution -- African slavery as it exists amongst us -- the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the \"rock upon which the old Union would split.\" He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old constitution, were that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with, but the general opinion of the men of that day was that, somehow or other in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away. This idea, though not incorporated in the constitution, was the prevailing idea at that time. The constitution, it is true, secured every essential guarantee to the institution while it should last, and hence no argument can be justly urged against the constitutional guarantees thus secured, because of the common sentiment of the day. Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon it fell when the \"storm came and the wind blew.\"\n \n Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery -- subordination to the superior race -- is his natural and normal condition. [Applause.] This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth. This truth has been slow in the process of its development, like all other truths in the various departments of science. It has been so even amongst us. Many who hear me, perhaps, can recollect well, that this truth was not generally admitted, even within their day. The errors of the past generation still clung to many as late as twenty years ago. Those at the North, who still cling to these errors, with a zeal above knowledge, we justly denominate fanatics. All fanaticism springs from an aberration of the mind -- from a defect in reasoning. It is a species of insanity. One of the most striking characteristics of insanity, in many instances, is forming correct conclusions from fancied or erroneous premises; so with the anti-slavery fanatics; their conclusions are right if their premises were. They assume that the negro is equal, and hence conclude that he is entitled to equal privileges and rights with the white man. If their premises were correct, their conclusions would be logical and just -- but their premise being wrong, their whole argument fails. I recollect once of having heard a gentleman from one of the northern States, of great power and ability, announce in the House of Representatives, with imposing effect, that we of the South would be compelled, ultimately, to yield upon this subject of slavery, that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics, as it was in physics or mechanics. That the principle would ultimately prevail. That we, in maintaining slavery as it exists with us, were warring against a principle, a principle founded in nature, the principle of the equality of men. The reply I made to him was, that upon his own grounds, we should, ultimately, succeed, and that he and his associates, in this crusade against our institutions, would ultimately fail.

   "Did you actually look?\n \n Slavery in the North\n\n \n Actually I did find this site but only the banner would display.\n \n \"The American Revolution was the death knell of Northern slavery. The rhetoric of the rebels, based on the Enlightenment doctrine of &#8220;natural rights,&#8221; immediately ran into the hypocrisy of a slave-owning people crying out for freedom. Tory Samuel Johnson twitted the Americans in 1775: \"How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?\" The rebels were sensitive to the taunt. &#8220;To contend for liberty and to deny that blessing to others,&#8221; John Jay wrote, &#8220;involves an inconsistency not to be excused.&#8221; Nathaniel Niles put it succinctly: &#8220;For shame, let us either cease to enslave our fellow-men, or else let us cease to complain of those that would enslave us.&#8221; James Otis found another thread in the argument when he wrote, &#8220;It is a clear truth that those who every day barter away other men&#8217;s liberty, will soon care little for their own.&#8221;[1] \"\n \n Third link down on this website.\n \n The north had no slaves at the time of the civil war; if they did they would have been freed by the 13th amendment.\n \n The &#8216;brainwashing&#8217; of Lincoln and the abolitionist starting a war to free southern slaves is extremely accurate.\n \n Let's sum up the facts here:[*]The vice president of the confederacy stated that his new government would be based on the premise that blacks and whites are not equal, and that the cause of the current revolution was African slavery.\n [*]President Lincoln, an avowed abolitionist became president immediately before secession (coincidence?). He stated many times he believed that slaves deserved emancipation and tried to proclaim this before the war was over.\n [*]Southern politics made it clear that slavery in general was not on the negotiating table and northern abolitionist demanded that it be.\n [*]Official compromises and debates for decades before the war such as the Missouri compromise prove that federal politics was under the direct and greatest influence by the abolitionist and anti-abolitionist movements.\n [*]There is the fact that before states &#8217; rights had been infringed upon many times by the federal government, this was the only time when the agreement and disagreement of those actions took a definite geographical shape. That fact alone shows that this particular disagreement was the disagreement that caused civil war. &#8220;It&#8217;s about states&#8217; rights not slavery&#8221; &#8211; The south used states rights as it&#8217;s justification to reject federal legislation on slavery. If you rob a bank and say you needed it because you wanted a new car, then the trial is not about &#8220;whether you needed a new car&#8221; it&#8217;s about you robbing a bank.\n The abolitionist didn&#8217;t care if it was the federal government or Santa clause that freed the slaves, secession was a preemptive move against abolitionist&#8217;s attacks through the federal government, had the abolitionists conceded that the southern states had the rights to make their own laws but they were going to stop slavery anyway because they don&#8217;t give a XXXX about law and order there would still have been a war.\n \n &#8220;Lincoln didn&#8217;t really want to free the slaves&#8221; &#8211; Untrue\n \n &#8220;Lincoln wasn&#8217;t fighting the war to stop slavery&#8221; &#8211; but certainly the south was fighting the war to preserve it.\n It was been noted that after the war started he said he would free no slave if that would save the union. That would not save the union, and I don&#8217;t care about the motivations of Lincoln as they are clear by his other statements.\n \n If he really didn&#8217;t want to go to war over his own beliefs, if he really wanted a united country he would have stepped down the second after the first fort was ceased.\n \n &#8220;The north didn&#8217;t care about slavery it was about preserving the union&#8221; &#8211; If that was true Lincoln would have been impeached when it was clear the south was going to secede. Further northern politics would not have been dominated by the abolitionist voting bloc.\n \n &#8220;There were cultural differences that divided north and south, that&#8217;s why there was tension&#8221; &#8211; There are cultural differences now, only one issue did the north find unacceptable and non negotiable. Would one seriously believe that there was a civil war over mannerisms? No it can be seen clearly by the fact that reconstruction worked that the only difference significant enough to cause a war between north and south is slavery.\n \n The question I am interested in is not among the ones brought up.\n \n I ask you(anyone who disagrees with me on these points) why in the world would you want to believe the confederacy and the war were not due solely to the immorality of slavery?\n \n Trying to preserve southern pride?\n \n Like the way the confederate flag looks?\n \n Get romantic when you think about rebellion?\n \n &#8230;. Thought their cause was just?\n \n You can see I am dumbfounded by it. My best guess would be anti-authority fallacy.

   "Like COBHC, I prefer to deal in fact myself. So, here's a question for you. If the Civil War was fought over and because of slavery, why did the Emancipation Proclamation ONLY free slaves in the South and not everywhere within the US?\n\n \n Good question.\n \n 1. Economic and social differences between the North and the South.\n The cotton gin essentially made the South a one crop wonder, sic. On the other hand, the northern economy was based more on industry than agriculture. In fact, the northern industries were purchasing the raw cotton and turning it into finished goods. This disparity between the two set up a major difference in economic attitudes. The South was based on the plantation system while the North was focused on city life. This change in the North meant that society evolved as people of different cultures and classes had to work together. On the other hand, the South continued to hold onto an antiquated social order.\n \n 2: States versus federal rights.\n Since the time of the Revolution, two camps emerged: those arguing for greater states rights and those arguing that the federal government needed to have more control. The first organized government in the US after the American Revolution was under the Articles of Confederation. The thirteen states formed a loose confederation with a very weak federal government. However, when problems arose, the weakness of this form of government caused the leaders of the time to come together at the Constitutional Convention and create, in secret, the US Constitution. Strong proponents of states rights like Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry were not present at this meeting. Many felt that the new constitution ignored the rights of states to continue to act independently. They felt that the states should still have the right to decide if they were willing to accept certain federal acts. This resulted in the idea of nullification, whereby the states would have the right to rule federal acts unconstitutional. The federal government denied states this right. However, proponents such as John C. Calhoun fought vehemently for nullification. When nullification would not work and states felt that they were no longer respected, they moved towards secession. \n \n 3. The fight between Slave and Non-Slave State Proponents.\n As America began to expand, first with the lands gained from the Louisiana Purchase and later with the Mexican War, the question of whether new states admitted to the union would be slave or free. The Missouri Compromise passed in 1820 made a rule that prohibited slavery in states from the former Louisiana Purchase the latitude 36 degrees 30 minutes north except in Missouri. During the Mexican War, conflict started about what would happen with the new territories that the US expected to gain upon victory. David Wilmot proposed the Wilmot Proviso in 1846 which would ban slavery in the new lands. However, this was shot down to much debate. The Compromise of 1850 was created by Henry Clay and others to deal with the balance between slave and free states, northern and southern interests. One of the provisions was the fugitive slave act that was discussed in number one above. Another issue that further increased tensions was the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. It created two new territories that would allow the states to use popular sovereignty to determine whether they would be free or slave. The real issue occurred in Kansas where proslavery Missourians began to pour into the state to help force it to be slave. They were called &#8220;Border Ruffians.&#8221; Problems came to a head in violence at Lawrence Kansas. The fighting that occurred caused it to be called &#8220;Bleeding Kansas.&#8221; The fight even erupted on the floor of the senate when antislavery proponent Charles Sumner was beat over the head by South Carolina&#8217;s Senator Preston Brooks. \n \n 4. Growth of the Abolition Movement.\n Increasingly, the northerners became more polarized against slavery. Sympathies began to grow for abolitionists and against slavery and slaveholders. This occurred especially after some major events including: the publishing of Harriet Beecher Stowe&#8217;s Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin, the Dred Scott Case, John Brown&#8217;s Raid, and the passage of the fugitive slave act that held individuals responsible for harboring fugitive slaves even if they were located in non-slave states.\n \n 5. The election of Abraham Lincoln.\n Even though things were already coming to a head, when Lincoln was elected in 1860, South Carolina issued its &#8220;Declaration of the Causes of Secession.&#8221; They believed that Lincoln was anti-slavery and in favor of Northern interests. Before Lincoln was even president, seven states had seceded from the Union: South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas.\n excerpts from 'americanhistory.about.com.'",

Perhaps some of the states would have resisted participation in WW1 and America could have fought Americans then.\n\n You don't fight a war to avoid war. The encroachment of federal power was not limited to the south, why did the only the south rebel?\n \n The revolution was fought by all states and the north was first to the fight.\n \n \n \nLike COBHC, I prefer to deal in fact myself. So, here's a question for you. If the Civil War was fought over and because of slavery, why did the Emancipation Proclamation ONLY free slaves in the South and not everywhere within the US?\n\n Because lincoln was not perfect. Here is a question, if it was not about freeing slaves why did they use federal power to threaten emancipation and start a war?\n \n \nGood question.\n \n 1. Economic and social differences between the North and the South.\n The cotton gin essentially made the South a one crop wonder, sic. On the other hand, the northern economy was based more on industry than agriculture. In fact, the northern industries were purchasing the raw cotton and turning it into finished goods. This disparity between the two set up a major difference in economic attitudes. The South was based on the plantation system while the North was focused on city life. This change in the North meant that society evolved as people of different cultures and classes had to work together. On the other hand, the South continued to hold onto an antiquated social order.\n \n 2: States versus federal rights.\n Since the time of the Revolution, two camps emerged: those arguing for greater states rights and those arguing that the federal government needed to have more control. The first organized government in the US after the American Revolution was under the Articles of Confederation. The thirteen states formed a loose confederation with a very weak federal government. However, when problems arose, the weakness of this form of government caused the leaders of the time to come together at the Constitutional Convention and create, in secret, the US Constitution. Strong proponents of states rights like Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry were not present at this meeting. Many felt that the new constitution ignored the rights of states to continue to act independently. They felt that the states should still have the right to decide if they were willing to accept certain federal acts. This resulted in the idea of nullification, whereby the states would have the right to rule federal acts unconstitutional. The federal government denied states this right. However, proponents such as John C. Calhoun fought vehemently for nullification. When nullification would not work and states felt that they were no longer respected, they moved towards secession. \n \n 3. The fight between Slave and Non-Slave State Proponents.\n As America began to expand, first with the lands gained from the Louisiana Purchase and later with the Mexican War, the question of whether new states admitted to the union would be slave or free. The Missouri Compromise passed in 1820 made a rule that prohibited slavery in states from the former Louisiana Purchase the latitude 36 degrees 30 minutes north except in Missouri. During the Mexican War, conflict started about what would happen with the new territories that the US expected to gain upon victory. David Wilmot proposed the Wilmot Proviso in 1846 which would ban slavery in the new lands. However, this was shot down to much debate. The Compromise of 1850 was created by Henry Clay and others to deal with the balance between slave and free states, northern and southern interests. One of the provisions was the fugitive slave act that was discussed in number one above. Another issue that further increased tensions was the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. It created two new territories that would allow the states to use popular sovereignty to determine whether they would be free or slave. The real issue occurred in Kansas where proslavery Missourians began to pour into the state to help force it to be slave. They were called \"Border Ruffians.\" Problems came to a head in violence at Lawrence Kansas. The fighting that occurred caused it to be called \"Bleeding Kansas.\" The fight even erupted on the floor of the senate when antislavery proponent Charles Sumner was beat over the head by South Carolina's Senator Preston Brooks. \n \n 4. Growth of the Abolition Movement.\n Increasingly, the northerners became more polarized against slavery. Sympathies began to grow for abolitionists and against slavery and slaveholders. This occurred especially after some major events including: the publishing of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, the Dred Scott Case, John Brown's Raid, and the passage of the fugitive slave act that held individuals responsible for harboring fugitive slaves even if they were located in non-slave states.\n \n 5. The election of Abraham Lincoln.\n Even though things were already coming to a head, when Lincoln was elected in 1860, South Carolina issued its \"Declaration of the Causes of Secession.\" They believed that Lincoln was anti-slavery and in favor of Northern interests. Before Lincoln was even president, seven states had seceded from the Union: South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas.\n excerpts from 'americanhistory.about.com.'\n\n \n 1, is ridiculous, people do not decide to kill each other because they grow cotton and someone else works in a factory. Even so let it be noted the clear economic difference was caused by plantation mentality which required slavery.\n \n 2, is a justification, the federal rights that were contradicting state rights in the opinion of the south were abolitionist intentions. Secondly note how \"states\" and not \"southern states\" are used in the explanation because there were no encroachments on northern state rights sufficient to cause succession.\n \n 3, 4 and 5 are slavery directly.",

   ".....\n Because Lincoln was not perfect. Here is a question, if it was not about freeing slaves why did they use federal power to threaten emancipation and start a war? \n\n \n Lincoln was an abolitionist, that's not in dispute. What's in dispute was that the Civil War was fought to \"free the slaves\" as inaccurate history textbooks have stated. Now, a little history lesson for you. \n In Lincoln's inauguration address, he stated that he had NO intentions of ending slavery and stated that the Fugative Slave Law should be enforced in non-slave states. \n \n\n Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that- \n I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. 3\n Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had made this and many similar declarations and had never recanted them; and more than this, they placed in the platform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read: \n Resolved, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and especially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend; and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter what pretext, as among the gravest of crimes. March 4, 1861 \n \n\n \n Prior to the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln proposed that slave-owners be compensated for the voluntary loss of property (slaves). This went over in Congress like a lead balloon. \n The war was already in full force when the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, so your timeline is off. \n The slaves were only freed in the rebellious states and NOT in states and territories sympathetic to or supporting the North. Lincoln's Secretary of State said \"\"We show our symapthy with slavery by emancipating slaves where we cannot reach them and holding them in bondage where we can set them free.\"\n Lincoln's freeing of the slaves was an economic and political decision. He hoped to disrupt the South's ability to generate money and use its slaves to prosecute the war AND he wanted a moral high ground on which to rally the North and its foreign sympathizers. \n \n\n Though \"contraband\" slaves had been declared free, Lincoln continued to insist that this was a war to save the Union, not to free slaves. But by 1862, Lincoln was considering emancipation as a necessary step toward winning the war. The South was using enslaved people to aid the war effort. Black men and women were forced to build fortifications, work as blacksmiths, nurses, boatmen, and laundresses, and to work in factories, hospitals, and armories. In the meantime, the North was refusing to accept the services of black volunteers and freed slaves, the very people who most wanted to defeat the slaveholders. In addition, several governments in Europe were considering recognizing the Confederacy and intervening against the Union. If Lincoln declared this a war to free the slaves, European public opinion would overwhelmingly back the North.\n On July 22, 1862, Lincoln showed a draft of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation to his cabinet. It proposed to emancipate the slaves in all rebel areas on January 1, 1863. Secretary of State William H. Seward agreed with the proposal, but cautioned Lincoln to wait until the Union had a major victory before formally issuing the proclamation. Lincoln's chance came after the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam in September of 1862. He issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on September 22. The proclamation warned the Confederate states to surrender by January 1, 1863, or their slaves would be freed. \n \n Some people were critical of the proclamation for only freeing some of the slaves. Others, including Frederick Douglass, were jubilant. Douglass felt that it was the beginning of the end of slavery, and that it would act as a \"moral bombshell\" to the Confederacy. Yet he and others feared that Lincoln would give in to pressure from northern conservatives, and would fail to keep his promise. Despite the opposition, however, the president remained firm. On January 1, 1863, he issued the final Emancipation Proclamation. With it he officially freed all slaves within the states or parts of states that were in rebellion and not in Union hands. This left one million slaves in Union territory still in bondage. \n \n Throughout the North, African Americans and their white allies were exhuberant. They packed churches and meeting halls and celebrated the news. In the South, most slaves did not hear of the proclamation for months. But the purpose of the Civil War had now changed. The North was not only fighting to preserve the Union, it was fighting to end slavery.The Civil War \n\n \n So, you see, it wasn't until after the Emancipation Proclamation that Lincoln deftly linked the Civil War to the goal of ending slavery.",

For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery.\" - Georgia\n \n \"While it (republican party) attracts to itself by its creed the scattered advocates of exploded political heresies, of condemned theories in political economy, the advocates of commercial restrictions, of protection, of special privileges, of waste and corruption in the administration of Government, anti-slavery is its mission and its purpose.\" - Georgia\n \n \"twenty years past the abolitionists and their allies in the Northern States have been engaged in constant efforts to subvert our institutions and to excite insurrection and servile war among us.\" - Georgia\n \n Georgia's statement is by far the best example of my point. It made great effort to point out how protectionism was defeated but only by abolitionist voting power did the protected businesses find a way to take back power.\n \n \"All these classes saw this and felt it and cast about for new allies. The anti-slavery sentiment of the North offered the best chance for success.\" - Georgia\n \n Georgia did not say that their special interests were the cause of this war, indeed they had suffered at those special interest for decades before. It was the fact that the special interest's political power was now being waged through abolitionist, through radicals who would be wholly willing to deprive southern rights regardless of the constitution it implies.\n \n You may say that the north was not entirely motivated by ending slavery, you would be right, you may say the south was not entirely motivated by keeping slavery and you would be right.\n \n It cannot however be more clearly demonstrated that slavery and the abolitionist are entirely either the cause or the catalyst for every reason.\n \n \"Why? Because by their declared principles and policy they have outlawed $3,000,000,000 of our property in the common territories of the Union; put it under the ban of the Republic in the States where it exists and out of the protection of Federal law everywhere; because they give sanctuary to thieves and incendiaries who assail it to the whole extent of their power, in spite of their most solemn obligations and covenants; because their avowed purpose is to subvert our society and subject us not only to the loss of our property but the destruction of ourselves, our wives, and our children, and the desolation of our homes, our altars, and our firesides. To avoid these evils we resume the powers which our fathers delegated to the Government of the United States, and henceforth will seek new safeguards for our liberty, equality, security, and tranquillity. \" - Georgia\n What property do you think they are refering to, what incendiaries, what society?\n \n Well what about the others? Mississippi makes it's cause much faster:\n \n \"In the momentous step which our State has taken of dissolving its connection with the government of which we so long formed a part, it is but just that we should declare the prominent reasons which have induced our course. \n \n Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin. \" - Mississippi\n \n \"It refuses the admission of new slave States into the Union, and seeks to extinguish it by confining it within its present limits, denying the power of expansion. \n \n It tramples the original equality of the South under foot. \n \n It has nullified the Fugitive Slave Law in almost every free State in the Union, and has utterly broken the compact which our fathers pledged their faith to maintain. \n \n It advocates negro equality, socially and politically, and promotes insurrection and incendiaries in our midst. \n \n It has enlisted its press, its pulpit and its schools against us, until the whole popular mind of the North is excited and inflamed with prejudice. \n \n It has made combinations and formed associations to carry out its schemes of emancipation in the States and wherever else slavery exists. \n \n It seeks not to elevate or to support the slave, but to destroy his present condition without providing a better. \n \n It has invaded a State, and invested with the honors of martyrdom the wretch whose purpose was to apply flames to our dwellings, and the weapons of destruction to our lives. \n \n It has broken every compact into which it has entered for our security. \n \n It has given indubitable evidence of its design to ruin our agriculture, to prostrate our industrial pursuits and to destroy our social system. \n \n It knows no relenting or hesitation in its purposes; it stops not in its march of aggression, and leaves us no room to hope for cessation or for pause. \n \n It has recently obtained control of the Government, by the prosecution of its unhallowed schemes, and destroyed the last expectation of living together in friendship and brotherhood. \" - Mississippi\n \n How many of those reasons are directly about slavery? How many indirectly?\n \n South Carolina puts forth it's justification under the constitution, and then names the cause.\n \n \"A geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery. He is to be entrusted with the administration of the common Government, because he has declared that that \"Government cannot endure permanently half slave, half free,\" and that the public mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course of ultimate extinction. \" - South Carolina\n \n They did not say he intended to fight a war to free slaves, they said he was hostile to slavery.\n \n Are they wrong?\n \n \"Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them? \" - Texas\n \n Throughout the common theme was the interchangeability of the south with \"slave-holding states\" and the north with \"non-slave holding states\"\n \n The declaration of independence has in it the a list of grievances too, among them was:\n \n \"He(the king) has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\"\n \n Shall we take from that that independence was not the cause of the revolution and that military presence in the colonies was?\n \n All the grievances were symptoms of colonial self-government being denied recognition.\n \n All the grievances for the confederacy were symptoms of non-slave holding states holding the federal governments power.\n \n They mention in passing special interest legislation but every single one give slavery as their prime purpose, and their right to choose for themselves that issue as their justification.\n \n What do I think the revolution was about? Taxes. The justification? Inalienable rights.\n \n What do I think the civil war was about? Slavery. The justification? The constitution.\n \nThat's correct, the North was the aggressor\n\n Of course.\n \nand the carpetbaggers and subsequent Federal legislation sealed its motivations and intent in history.\n\n You mean like the thirteenth amendment and reconstruction?\n \n \nYeah, right \"The North just wanted to free the slaves.\"\n\n Yea, right \"The south just wanted agricultural tariffs removed\"\n \n \nWas the invasion of Iraq about 'oil'?\n\n No\n \nThere are far more underlying and motivating reasons of the 'few' towards gaining riches which cannot be attained unless they can catalyze the mass to take up arms. Lincoln, like Bush was swayed by the greed of those rich wanting to obtain the spoils to get richer.\n\n It would be hard to play an abolitionist for a fool, because they wanted emancipation at any cost. They got it.\n \n On the other hand it seems like the \"average\" white southerner got more than they bargained for because whether they knew it or not they were in a war about slavery.\n \n \nIf you pulled 100 Southerners at random in 1860, you would likely have found that only 1 of them had one or more slaves. Southerners didn't have a 'plantation mentality', that's another 'catalyst', and deriding term of the morally superior.\n\n Could the cotton trade as it stood exist without slavery?\n \n and the % of slave holders to non-slave holders\n \n Mississippi: 49% \n South Carolina: 46% \n Georgia: 37% \n Alabama: 35% \n Florida: 34% \n Louisiana: 29% \n Texas: 28% \n North Carolina: 28% \n Virginia: 26% \n Tennessee: 25% \n Kentucky: 23% \n Arkansas: 20% \n Missouri: 13% \n Maryland: 12% \n Delaware: 3% \n \n \n \nIt HAS you be slavery to you, it is the ONLY thing that will suffice.\n\n It is slavery.\n \n You are fighting a battle you can't win Esdraelon, The civil war was as much about slavery as any war has ever been about a single issue. All evidence points to that fact.\n \n \nLincoln was an abolitionist, that&#8217;s not in dispute. What&#8217;s in dispute was that the Civil War was fought to &#8220;free the slaves&#8221; as inaccurate history textbooks have stated. Now, a little history lesson for you. \n\n \n Not quite, the topic of this thread is what caused the civil war. It seems to me that the desire of the south to preserve slavery was greater than Lincoln's desire to end it.\n \n In combination however there can be no doubt that the cause was slavery and the abolitionist movement.\n \n \nIn Lincoln&#8217;s inauguration address, he stated that he had NO intentions of ending slavery and stated that the Fugative Slave Law should be enforced in non-slave states. \n\n Yes, the abolotionist didn't share that view, nor did the south believe him.\n \n \nPrior to the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln proposed that slave-owners be compensated for the voluntary loss of property (slaves). This went over in Congress like a lead balloon. \n The war was already in full force when the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, so your timeline is off. \n The slaves were only freed in the rebellious states and NOT in states and territories sympathetic to or supporting the North. Lincoln&#8217;s Secretary of State said &#8220;\"We show our symapthy with slavery by emancipating slaves where we cannot reach them and holding them in bondage where we can set them free.\"\n Lincoln&#8217;s freeing of the slaves was an economic and political decision. He hoped to disrupt the South&#8217;s ability to generate money and use its slaves to prosecute the war AND he wanted a moral high ground on which to rally the North and its foreign sympathizers. \n \n \n So, you see, it wasn't until after the Emancipation Proclamation that Lincoln deftly linked the Civil War to the goal of ending slavery.\n\n Yes it is undeniable that Lincoln would rather have let the south have slaves then fight a war.\n \n A war was fought and it was over slavery, apparently his view was not believed or not accepted.\n \n If the north was willing to let the south have slaves like it appears Lincoln was why did the southern states declare anti-slavery policy as their reasons time and again?\n \n South Carolina specifically mentioned Lincoln.\n \n Either they thought we was lying in his inaugural address or they didn't care.",

It was only revisionist historians that retro-fitted slavery as the cause for the Civil War. If the Confederate States would have agreed to rejoin the Union, they could have kept their slaves. \n \n \nYes, the abolotionist didn't share that view, nor did the south believe him.\n\n Regardless, you have the facts right there in front of you, yet you continue to argue against them.\n \n\n Yes it is undeniable that Lincoln would rather have let the south have slaves then fight a war.\n \n A war was fought and it was over slavery, apparently his view was not believed or not accepted.\n \n If the north was willing to let the south have slaves like it appears Lincoln was why did the southern states declare anti-slavery policy as their reasons time and again?\n \n South Carolina specifically mentioned Lincoln.\n \n Either they thought we was lying in his inaugural address or they didn't care.\n\n I don't see any possibility of getting you to see the facts, so I'm not sure why I bother. South Carolina seceded after Lincoln's election because, amongst other things, they believed that Lincoln would try to end slavery. He stated that his intent was to preserve the Union, not end slavery and all of his actions up until the Emancipation Proclamation supported that statement. It wasn't until 1863 that the North began to link the war effort to ending slavery. It did this for three main reasons: 1) to thwart Confederate use of slaves to fortify the Confederacy, 2) to allow the use of black soldiers to prosecute the war and 3) to garner foreign support from countries opposed to slavery. \n When the Civil War started, only 1/4 of Southern whites owned slaves, so the vast majority of Confederate soldiers had no stake in the issue of slavery. They did, however, have a strong belief in state's rights. That's what they were fighting for, not so that their neighbors could keep their slaves.",

There was no declaration of war by Congress.\n\n \n Face it, JP, while Freedom is steeped in 'morality' as he notes himself, and is completely adhered to his premise that when rich Northerners got rid of their house slaves they suddenly became bastions of morality themselves, he has his own facts and believes those facts are the only facts.\n \n The attempt to force blame for all America's ills onto the South led the Northern leadership to extreme twists of logic. Abolitionist leaders in New England noted the \"degraded\" condition of the local black communities. Yet the common abolitionist explanation of this had nothing to do with northerners, black or white. Instead, they blamed it on the continuance of slavery in the South. \"The toleration of slavery in the South,\" Garrison editorialized, \"is the chief cause of the unfortunate situation of free colored persons in the North.\"[1]\n \n \"This argument, embraced almost universally by New England abolitionists, made good sense as part of a strategy to heap blame for everything wrong with American society on southern slavery, but it also had the advantage, to northern ears, of conveniently shifting accountability for a locally specific situation away from the indigenous institution from which it had evolved.\"[2]\n \n Melish's perceptive book, \"Disowning Slavery,\" argues that the North didn't simply forget that it ever had slaves. She makes a forceful case for a deliberate re-writing of the region's past, in the early 1800s. By the 1850s, Melish writes, \"New England had become a region whose history had been re-visioned by whites as a triumphant narrative of free, white labor.\" And she adds that this \"narrative of a historically free, white New England also advanced antebellum New England nationalism by supporting the region's claims to a superior moral identity that could be contrasted effectively with the 'Jacobinism' of a slave-holding, 'negroized' South.\" The demonizing adjective is one she borrows from Daniel Webster, who used it in the Webster-Hayne debate of 1830.\n \n The word is well-chosen. Webster's \"Second Reply,\" given in January 1830 during his debate with Robert Young Hayne of South Carolina -- the most famous speech in a famous clash of North and South -- shows the master orator of his time at the peak of his powers. In these speeches Webster compellingly turned New England sectional values into the supreme national values, while at the same time playing on the racist fears of the average Northerner, who loathed slavery less for its inherent injustice and more because it flooded the country with blacks.\n \n Webster \"articulated a clear and compelling vision of an American nation made up of the union of northern and western states, bonded by an interpretation of the origin and meaning of the union and the U.S. Constitution and reflecting the core values of New England political culture and history. Coded implicitly among those essential values were claims to historical freedom and whiteness, against which Webster could effectively contrast a South isolated by its historical commitment to slavery. Such an interpretation, appealing as it did to the widespread desire among northern states outside New England to eradicate their black populations and achieve a 'whiteness' like that of New England, could rally and solidify northern opposition to Slave Power.\"[3]\n \n In the speech, Webster, like Pilate, washes his hands of anything to do with American slavery. \"The domestic slavery of the Southern States I leave where I find it, -- in the hands of their own governments. It is their affair, not mine.\" This allows him to keep within the frame of the Constitution, and at the same time cleverly disavow more than a century and a half of New England slavery and slave-trading, which had financed the first families and institutions of his home district.\n \n After this contemptuous dismissal, he holds forth on the glories of pure Massachusetts, which he apotheosizes, above Philadelphia and Virginia, till it becomes the true genius of independence. \"There is Boston, and Concord, and Lexington, and Bunker Hill; ... where American liberty raised its first voice, and where its youth was nurtured and sustained, there it still lives in the strength of its manhood and full of its original spirit.\"\n \n This was the opening salvo. Within a few months, Webster's speech had been reprinted whole in newspapers across the country and published in pamphlets that ran through 20 editions. A single printing of it churned out 40,000 copies. Other Northern speakers and writers picked up the tone and carried it like a battle-flag down the years to the Civil War.\n \n \"Indeed, by the outset of the actual war in 1861 the New England nationalist trope of virtuous, historical whiteness, clothed as it was in a distinctive set of cultural, moral, and political values associated with New England's Puritan mission and Revolutionary struggle, had come to define the Unionist North as a whole.\"[4]\n \n Nothing illustrates this process better, perhaps, than the semantic development of the word \"Yankee,\" which, in United States usage, always meant \"a New Englander\" before the Civil War. But within a decade of Appomattox, it was being used generically by Americans to mean \"an American, regardless of place of residence.\" http://www.slavenorth.com/denial.htm\n \n But then again, my only argument is that slavery was A catalyst, not THE catalyst as he apparently is arguing.",

There would have been no war about states rights. Men like Frederick Douglas made sure that the north in general believed this war was about slavery.\n\n \n All one needs to do is look at the history of the Confederate Constitution and why the states said they seceeded.\n \n\n Background of the Confederate States Constitution\n \n The states that left the American Union in 1860 and 1861 brought with them a rich tradition of constitutionalism. Many Southern Leaders explained their support for secession in terms of the failure of the Federal compact. Most blamed Northerners for failing to live up to their obligations, although some thought it was structural flaws in the U.S. Constitution that made secession necessary. \n The Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States of America signed on February 8, 1861, created a compact among six Deep South states. The Permanent Confederate Constitution, signed on March 11, 1861, created a political structure for what became the eleven-state Confederate nation. Both documents were similar to the U.S. Constitution. The differences between the two reflected the political struggles that had led to secession.\n Background of the Confederate States Constitution \n\n \n \n Well that was embarrassing, but my point stands 85+18 is well beyond the life span of the average American of these times.\n \n (18 being when they could have bought and owned slaves)\n [/quote]\n \n That assumed that no Northerners moved north during those years. I'm sure it wasn't that uncommon for a Southerner to move north for economic reasons, so it's not too far fetched saying that some Northerners owned slaves during their lifetime. \n \n\n \n The north or Lincoln?\n \n Abolitionist pushed Lincoln to fee all slaves everywhere; to get re-elected Lincoln campaigned on this.\n\n \n By the time the election of 1864 came around, the Emancipation Proclamation had already been issued and there was no need to attempt to appease the South any further. Lincoln made more hay as an abolitionist then as a Federalist.\n As Lincoln stated, if he could have let the South keep its slaves AND hold the Union together, he would have. That statement alone speaks volumes about his position WRT slavery. He was opposed to slavery, but not enough to wage a war over.\n \n The South's seeds of rebellion came about because of population demographics. The North's population grew much faster than the South's, so the number of representatives from the North also grew faster. The South saw every move that the Federal government made as showing favoritism to the North. They felt that they would be better off if they withdrew from a Union that was stacked against their interests. Slavery was only one of those interests.",

No of course not because it doesn't have anything in common with half of the states.\n \n \n40% of the Souith's population were slaves so they didn't count towards representation. \n\n You mean not wholly, besides 100% of the Souths citizens counted towards representation, why would they want more than that?\n \n \nThe two economies were as different as night and day. The North had become a collection of industrial cities, while the South was mostly a sprawling land of huge farms.\n\n The north had no interest in destroying farms they had an interest in destroying slavery.\n \n The south had no interest in destroying cities, they had an interest in protecting slavery.\n \n \nTheir needs were different\n\n Oh yes very different:\n \"Slavery's labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.\" - Mississippi\n \n \ntheir thinking was different.\n\n Right again:\n \"Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery -- subordination to the superior race -- is his natural and normal condition. [Applause.]\"  - Alexander Stephens\n \n \nThat exists to this day, even.\n\n In the form of neo-nazi's, the KKK, and I hate to say it our president.\n \n The idea that slavery can be right was the difference in thought, the need for slaves was the difference in need.\n \n If agricultural tariffs were not the cause of the war. Has it occurred to you that Lincoln himself said the country cannot continue half slave and half free, that for him preserving the union was the solution to this dichotomy, that south Carolina recognized this?\n \n If it was about fiscal responsibility and all Lincoln was after was preserving the union, why didn't he appoint a responsible treasury secretory and not try to take over the south.\n \n I don't believe for a moment that if at any point before blood had been spilled Lincoln resigned and congress sent a letter of apology to the southern states assuring them that slavery would never be brought up on a federal level that the union would have been restored.\n \n \nSoutherners tend to be more self-sufficient and Conservative and Northerners tend to be more pro-government liberals.\n\n There is nothing pro-government about industry, nothing anti-government about agriculture.\n \n \nSee above.\n\n Google reasons for secession.\n \n \nLincoln ran as an abolitionist to get elected, just like Obama tried to run as a centrist. Lincoln tried to calm the South by reassuring them that he wasn't going to free the slaves, but that he was going to secure the Union remained intact. That way, he could appease his base by talking tough against the rebellious South while not alienating all Southerners.\n\n An fairly accurate description I believe, but his base was not happy with him for his compromising.\n \nAll one needs to do is look at the history of the Confederate Constitution\n\n \n Yes, indeed states rights. Note under section 9 \"No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law, or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves, shall be passed. \"\n \n \nand why the states said they seceeded.\n\n Where do you think these quotes by states that you are ignoring are coming from?\n \n\n That assumed that no Northerners moved north during those years. I'm sure it wasn't that uncommon for a Southerner to move north for economic reasons, so it's not too far fetched saying that some Northerners owned slaves during their lifetime. \n\n I don't suppose those ones would have been taking the moral high ground then.\n \n \nBy the time the election of 1864 came around, the Emancipation Proclamation had already been issued and there was no need to attempt to appease the South any further. Lincoln made more hay as an abolitionist then as a Federalist.\n\n Aye\n \nAs Lincoln stated, if he could have let the South keep its slaves AND hold the Union together, he would have.\n\n Exactly, this statement by it's implications reveals the situation almost entirely.\n \n \nThat statement alone speaks volumes about his position WRT slavery. He was opposed to slavery, but not enough to wage a war over.\n\n Yes\n \nThe South's seeds of rebellion came about because of population demographics. The North's population grew much faster than the South's, so the number of representatives from the North also grew faster. The South saw every move that the Federal government made as showing favoritism to the North. They felt that they would be better off if they withdrew from a Union that was stacked against their interests. \n\n There are currently many more people in California then in my own state, congress is not seen as being favoritive to California even though they have more representation than any other single state.\n \n Equal representation but unequal political power has been a constant in united states politics.\n \n \nSlavery was only one of those interests.\n\n The one they decided to name as the cause and the one that the north would not compromise on, not in the long run.",

   "Freedom, While as always, you are welcome to your opinions, and for the most part, we are generally on the same page, your opinions on this matter, while interesting, still seem to represent a personal bias. Maybe it's just my perception.\n \n Consider, for example, a quote by author Charles Dickens in a London periodical in December 1861, \"Union means so many millions a year lost to the South; secession means the loss of the same millions to the North. The love of money is the root of this as of many other evils....The quarrel between the North and South is, as it stands, solely a fiscal quarrel\". \n \n The South paid an undue proportion of federal revenues derived from tariffs, and these were expended by the federal government more in the North than the South: in 1840, the South paid 84% of the tariffs, rising to 87% in 1860. They paid 83% of the $13 million federal fishing bounties paid to New England fishermen, and also paid $35 million to Northern shipping interests which had a monopoly on shipping from Southern ports. The South, in effect, was paying tribute to the North. (notwithstanding your comment about California, California is a single state, let's consider what would happen if the entire far West states had most of their taxes go for the betterment of the Northern states)\n \n The address of Texas Congressman Reagan on 15 January 1861 summarizes this discontent: \n \n \"You are not content with the vast millions of tribute we pay you annually under the operation of our revenue law, our navigation laws, your fishing bounties, and by making your people our manufacturers, our merchants, our shippers. You are not satisfied with the vast tribute we pay you to build up your great cities, your railroads, your canals. You are not satisfied with the millions of tribute we have been paying you on account of the balance of exchange which you hold against us. You are not satisfied that we of the South are almost reduced to the condition of overseers of northern capitalists. You are not satisfied with all this; but you must wage a relentless crusade against our rights and institutions.\" \n \n As the London Times of 7 Nov 1861 stated: \"The contest is really for empire on the side of the North and for independence on that of the South....\".\n \n At the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Virginia had proposed a requirement for a 2/3 majority to enact laws regulating commerce and levying tariffs, which were the chief revenue of the federal government.\n \n George Mason of Virginia stated \"The effect of a provision to pass commercial laws by a simple majority would be to deliver the south bound hand and foot to the eastern states\". \n \n Virginia withdrew its amendment at the Convention in the interest of securing adoption of the Constitution, but ratification was with the proviso that it could be rescinded whenever the powers granted to the Union were used to oppress, and Virginia could then withdraw from the Union. \n \n True to George Mason's prediction, the high tariff of 1828 did bring the South to the verge of rebellion, leading Senator John C. Calhoun to unsuccessfully champion the concept of Nullification and the doctrine of the Concurrent Majority in 1833 to ensure that the South could have a veto power over commercial acts passed by a simple majority in Congress and the Senate.\n \n I wonder if you you choose your opinions like clothes: according to fashion.\n \n You've swallowed putrid myths that your elementary schools, and so on, have taught you to justify a war which caused the deaths of 620,000+ Americans.\n \n You seem totally unaware that between 1800 and 1860 dozens of countries, including the British Empire, ended slavery peacefully through compensated emancipation. Only in the United States was a war involved and emancipation made the war's raison d'etre 18 months after its beginning. \n \n The cost of the war alone could have emancipated every slave with ample compensation to slave owners, plus given every slave 40 acres and a mule to boot.\n \n You seem totally ignorant of the fact that the right of secession had been universally recognized in America; that the Declaration of Independence is a declaration of secession of colonies from the British Empire and states the \"long train of abuses and usurpation's\" which led to the despotism of George III and the right and duty to throw off such oppressive government; that New England Federalists proposed secession from the Union in the Hartford Convention 1814-15 because of their opposition to war with Great Britain. Every member of the Founding generation believed that the Union of the States was a voluntary one and to retain its members by coercion was despotism.\n \n If the War of Northern Aggression had actually begun as a war of emancipation (which it did not) Lincoln wouldn't have stated in his First Inaugural Speech that he had \"no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and have no inclination to do so.\" He always maintained that the Emancipation Proclamation was a desperate (and unconstitutional) war measure designed, no doubt, to avert the intervention of Britain and France.\n \n You seem likely ignorant that Black Codes of segregation in the North predated the Jim Crow era by two decades. One Ohio congressman threatened that if any blacks tried to cross the border into Ohio, \"the banks of the Ohion River... would be lined with men with muskets on their shoulders to keep off the emancipated slaves.\" The Providence Daily Post declared on Feb. 2, 1861 that \"we have no more right to meddle with slavery in Georgia, than we have to meddle with monarchy in Europe.\" Even the New York Times announced on Jan. 22,1861 that it opposed the abolition of slavery and, instead, proposed that slaves be allowed to legally marry and should be taught to read and invest their money in savings accounts.\n \n No, what is hidden more in the fog of the propaganda war for the minds of innocents like you is Lincoln's real agenda for going to war. It was not for Union, nor emancipation, but for consolidation of America under a dominant national government, where states would be mere appendages to its supreme sovereignty.\n \n Why? Because Lincoln's core political beliefs were inspired by Henry Clay and for the 28 years of his life in politics he pursued Clay's economic agenda, dubbed the \"American System,\" which in reality was Alexander Hamilton's program of imitating the British mercantile economy of national banking, fiat money, protectionist tariffs on government-favored industries, tax-funded subsidies to politically well-connected merchants, and \"internal improvements\" of the country's infrastructure (most notably a transcontinental railroad). Sound familiar?\n \n To Lincoln, who tired of hearing this agenda struck down in Congress as being unconstitutional, the South stood in the way. It mattered little to Lincoln that the taxes they paid on imported goods provided more than 3/4 the share of federal revenue prior to 1860 and that little of that federal revenue was being spent in the South. They saw his election as the radicalization of the Union and chose to legally leave it.\n \n And it was legal.",

   "Sorry, can you tell me which of these things you disagree with\n \n Liberation and self-defense cannot harm any innocent people\n The American civil war harmed innocent people\n Therefore the American civil war was not a war of liberation or self defence\n\n The last, the purpose of an endeavor is not dependent on its perfect success.\n \n For instance which of the following do you disagree with?\n \n Constructing a building cannot break another building.\n A certain building could fall over while being built.\n Therefore the enterprise of those who were trying to build the structure was not constructing a building.\n \n It was not the act of constructing period; that broke another building, it is the failure to design or build a building properly.\n \n Similarly if an innocent person is harmed by someone who was trying to defend himself, it was him trying to defend himself not him defending himself that caused it.\n \n It is the incorrect application of \"if A only has one cause B, then B = A\"\n that does not imply that B always causes A, however; so they are not equivalent.\n \n The definition of liberation is not \"any action that results from intending to liberate\" nor is the definition of self-defense \"any action that results from intending to defend one's self\".\n \n A more apt example for this case is if you see someone being robbed on the road, you act in an attempt to save him but the robber manages to kill him and wound you.\n \n In which case all the following statements are true and not in contradiction with each other:[*]Your act of attempting to stop the robber is an act of defending rights[*]Your act of of attempting to stop the robber indirectly caused the victims death and your injury.[*]You did not kill the victim nor injure yourself.[*]The act of defending rights does not violate them.\n \nliberation....self defense.....provocation...all relative \n\n Only if you refuse to believe they can be defined.\n \n \nMorality IS relative or maybe it is that the person observing morality is the 'relative',\n\n The latter, there is no concrete laws about what anyone will believe.\n \nare you attempting to suggest that the morality of today is not different from that of the time of the civil war?\n\n Yes\n \nActually if you want to argue that, then the argument would be that we, as a whole, are far less moral today than then.\n \n Most certainly that is true, as a whole.\n \n \nDuh? Then why did they die? \n\n Someone killed them, and I am not being sarcastic.\n \n Was it the goal of the United States forces to kill innocent people? Then why did they (if they did at all)?\n \n The only answer is that it was a mistake, a failure to liberate != liberation.\n \n I suspect you don't mean situations like that but you are blaming US forces for the acts of terrorist and resistance groups.\n \n If you are claiming that simply causing a war equals causing the killing of innocence that is incorrect despite its wide acceptance as a premise.\n \n In war you are not responsible for the actions of your enemy anymore than you were before.\n \n You may have caused them to pick up their evil activities but you can never be responsible for their activities yourself.\n \n The best possible position to deny such charges would be to claim that you are attempting to stop these evil people, such an excuse the US military now wields.\n \n \nDid anyone ask if they were ready to give their lives for the cause?\n\n I doubt it.\n \n \nNot missing the concept...so if the man helped 95% of those he set out to help, then the other other unfortunates are simply the casualties of war and their unfortunate demise is simply that war is hell? \n\n That was not the example, the man did not fail to help someone he killed them.\n \n \n \nBy WHOSE definition?\n\n Since I said it mine, I will assume you ask for further support of my statement because you disagree with it.\n \n The definition of self-defense being defense against someone who is attempting to or has already violated your rights.\n \n Such a person cannot be innocent so it is impossible to take aggression against an innocent person while maintaining the definition of self-defense.\n \n Liberation is the actions taken to remove a person from tyranny, since harming them would be an act of tyranny itself liberation is exclusive to harming innocence.\n \n \n \nAccording to whom?\n\n Since I said it, it was according to me. I will assume you request further explanation and supporting premises.\n \n It is not for them to disagree without reason because it is not for anyone to disagree without reason.\n \n A disagreement without reason is by definition baseless opinion caused by bias or random whim.\n \n \n \nOnly from the viewpoint of the aggressor in 'defending' themselves. It is a ploy used constantly in trials today.\n\n Again I am somewhat shocked that you can contradict the definition of a word and keep going as if you made a point.\n \n \"Self-defense is a sound rationalization\"\n \"Only from the viewpoint of those who weren't actually defending themselves but were the aggressors\"\n \".....\"\n \n Do you mean it actually isn't a sound rationalization or do you mean that few people who invoke it meet its criteria?",

Are you crusading against abortion?\n \n \nAgain trying to claim hypocrisy... having what to do with the cause of the war?\n\n \n I didn't say it had anything to do with the 'cause' of the war, simply that it is a hypocritical premise.\n \n \nYou have changed your argument from \"people didn't care enough about slavery to fight a war over it\" to \"the north didn't have the moral high ground\"\n\n \n Haven't changed anything, simply added it to the discussion when it became obvious that you are arguing the North's 'moral high ground'.\n \n \nWhy is beyond me.\n\n \n Try a little harder there and try to keep the bias down, it'll come to you.\n \n \nI speculated, and in response to your out of the blue statement about 'only in America did slavery have to end by a war' no less.\n\n \n Did I say that, I though Symbiote made that quote, though I agree with it, whether you do or not.\n \n \nSo if the north had really fought over slavery they would have just waited?\n\n \n Lincoln had to hurry to appease the abolitionists. Thus the results are as they are.\n \n \nSecondly I don't believe that is true.\n\n \n Well, feel free.\n \n \nThere was no \"before slavery\" in the United States.\n\n \n Really?\n \n \nTariffs targeting the southern slave based economy, the current government attempts to punish those it believes are being unjust with taxes and the federal government did the same then.\n\n \n Again, you claim that the tariffs were targeted at those 'being unjust'. Total naivety. Does the Constitution give the federal government the right to do thus? NO\n \n \nWhy were northern farmers not targeted?\n A. they didn't have cotton\n B. they didn't have slaves\n\n \n Correct because of an entirely different climate and growing season.\n \n \nConsidering that slavery was absolutely necessary to grow cotton (in the minds of the south) the answer becomes:\n They didn't have slaves.\n\n \n Still you are drawing a distinction between the commerce of one area and the commerce of another and stating that because one had slaves which were the norm at the time\n they should chuck their commerce out the door immediately because some abolitionists suddenly got morality.\n \n \nShow me one time where I even implied the reason for the war was slavery because I know slavery is wrong.\n\n \n Everything you have written implies it....\n \n \nYou do defend the motivations of the south, you know that rebelling against taxes and federal power is noble and protecting slavery is not.\n\n \n And you are comparing the South's motivations of that day with present day motivations.\n \n \nHe didn't believe so.\n\n \n A conclusion you draw irregardless of the evidence to the contrary of what he believed.\n \n \nAgain you speak of the morality of the matter as if your opinion matter now. (to the cause of the war)\n \n\n \n My opinion matters no more than yours.\n \n \nI did assume that someone correctly copied the documents of secession and the cornerstone speech and that those documents were not fraudulent but that is about all I assumed when attempted to support my statements about the beliefs of those who attacked and defended in the civil war. \n \n\n \n And it would have been better had the secession remained in effect. That is the real reason the war was fought because the South seceded, Lincoln and other liberal Northerners did not believe in the Southern states right to secede, and that is his premise in preserving the Union, slaves or no slaves, or whether the South would have seceded if there were no slaves. The bottom lie is \"Once the states joined the union, there were a part of that union regardless.\" This is NOT the original premise given the people when the constitution was ratified.",

And it was that USA that decided to intervene in WW1, allowing for the humiliation of \"Germany\" and ultimately the rise of Hitler.\n \n Secondly, Lincoln had an impact on Hitler's ideology, if you read Mein Kampf, you will read about Hitler's admiration for Lincoln, with Hitler impressed by the way he centralised state power, and how much he liked Lincoln's principle of crushing states rights.\n \n So I would suggest that if you are basing your argument for Lincoln on the construction of an alternate history, you take into account the inspiration and material support his war ultimately provided for Hitler, as well as the countless dead he was directly responsible for within his lifetime.",

The fact is those deaths are laid to his doorstep, regardless of your opinion.\n\n They are not regardless of yours.\n \n \nI disagree, you stated the definition yourself and you opinion does not claim authority beyond your opinion.\n\n I did state the definition myself and Lincoln does not fit it by any stretch of the imagination.\n \n \nYou stated it quite well there, and I pointed out your argument WAS based upon your belief in a superior morality as became clear as the argument proceeded.\n \n Name one time when I pointed to the moral superiority of the north as the reason why slavery caused the war.\n \n \n \nThe 'point to be made' today regarding say, abortion, is that it is a legal right, no matter that the morality of aborting millions of babies is gutter. Are you crusading against abortion?\n\n What? You do realize I was pointing out that the legality of Lincolns declaring war had nothing to do with why he did declare war.\n \n He didn't declare war because it was illegal to do so, so what are you talking about?\n \n \nI didn't say it had anything to do with the 'cause' of the war, simply that it is a hypocritical premise.\n\n Then you confirm what I said, that you stopped arguing about what caused the war and started arguing about the actual morality of the war.\n \n \nHaven't changed anything, simply added it to the discussion when it became obvious that you are arguing the North's 'moral high ground'.\n\n I again challange you to quote me giving the north's actual moral status as support for the conclusion that slavery caused the civil war.\n \n \nDid I say that, I though Symbiote made that quote, though I agree with it, whether you do or not.\n\n Eh no you didn't, that was a mistake.\n \n \n \nLincoln had to hurry to appease the abolitionists. Thus the results are as they are.\n\n He was an abolitionist, so he had to hurry to appease himself I suppose.\n \n \n \nWell, feel free.\n\n Well feel free to try to convince me, you know the whole argument thing.\n \n \nReally?\n\n Really\n \n \n \nAgain, you claim that the tariffs were targeted at those 'being unjust'.\n\n Yes, the abolitionist thought the south was unjust and as a result any outcry against unfair taxes in the south was certainly muted in the north.\n \nTotal naivety.\n\n It is happening as we speak, why do you think it doesn't happen?\n \nDoes the Constitution give the federal government the right to do thus? NO\n\n Does that matter to the argument? YES! It is further motivation for the south to fight the north.\n \n \n \nCorrect because of an entirely different climate and growing season.\n\n You are going to make me break out the documents of secession again aren't you?\n \n Can't you remember what was posted 5 pages ago?\n \n \nStill you are drawing a distinction between the commerce of one area and the commerce of another and stating that because one had slaves which were the norm at the time\n they should chuck their commerce out the door immediately because some abolitionists suddenly got morality.\n\n There you go again; talking about what I believe is right and proper. I am not telling anyone to chuck anything. You see I was born well after slavery ended, I would be telling this to corpses.\n \n Why did you point out the slavery was the norm at the time? Was it to defend southern motivations or to make a point as to why slavery was not the cause of the war?\n \n It could only be the latter if abolitionist cared at all, THEY DIDN'T!\n \n I maintain (with ease) that in the minds of the south their commerce was impossible without slavery.\n \n \n \nEverything you have written implies it....\n\n Then it should be very easy to find an example.\n \n \nAnd you are comparing the South's motivations of that day with present day motivations.\n\n When?\n \n I have pointed out the motivations of the south, I have pointed out the motivations of the north.\n \n I have pointed out that the motivations put them on the path to war and that the core of this difference was slavery.\n \n You are the one who started to talk about the actual morality of the war as opposed to the perceived morality at the time.\n \n \nA conclusion you draw irregardless of the evidence to the contrary of what he believed.\n\n The evidence is that very quote. He said if he could keep the union together and keep slavery he would. He did not keep the union together and keep slavery so either he lied or he believed he couldn't.\n \n \nMy opinion matters no more than yours.\n\n Which is both none as neither of us influenced the politics of those times.\n \n \n \nAnd it would have been better had the secession remained in effect.\n\n I don't understand how you can accuse me of injecting my personal opinion where it could have absolutely no relevance and then do the same yourself in the next paragraph.\n \n \nThat is the real reason the war was fought because the South seceded\n\n If that were true then he would not have needed to make it about slavery to maintain support.\n \n If that were true all he would have had to do is stick with the party line of \"preserve the union.\" That wasn't good enough as you yourself observed.\n \n More importantly the south seceded both directly and indirectly because of abolitionist political power.\n \n It is true that saying \"if there was no slavery, the south would not have seceded and even if they did the north would not have invaded\" is a speculation.\n \n It is also speculation to say that if there was no slavery and the south seceded the north would still have invaded.\n \n The historical fact is that the south did secede because of slavery and the north did invade because the south seceded to protect slavery from the political process.\n \n \nWell I do think you are wrong there, Freedom.\n \n Firstly, the American war against the south did result in the creation of the modern USA as a monolithic state. And it was that USA that decided to intervene in WW1, allowing for the humiliation of \"Germany\" and ultimately the rise of Hitler.\n \n Secondly, Lincoln had an impact on Hitler's ideology, if you read Mein Kampf, you will read about Hitler's admiration for Lincoln, with Hitler impressed by the way he centralised state power, and how much he liked Lincoln's principle of crushing states rights.\n\n The first is much more cogent than the second in my opinion.\n \n I think it is true that if the USA hadn't interfered in WW1 the Germans might have won, and that if they had won there would be nowhere for fascism to grow from.\n \n But to claim that Lincoln was responsible for that intervention is a tough sell; I would be interested to hear your argument on that.\n \n The second is absurd; do you really think Hitler would have different views on the state, the race, and society if Lincoln didn't exist?\n \n \nSo I would suggest that if you are basing your argument for Lincoln on the construction of an alternate history, you take into account the inspiration and material support his war ultimately provided for Hitler, as well as the countless dead he was directly responsible for within his lifetime.\n\n But how do you know that it wasn't actually.... Shaka Zulu who caused the rise of the Nazis!\n \n This is a truly ridiculous argument and it will become apparent the moment you start trying make specific inferences.",
