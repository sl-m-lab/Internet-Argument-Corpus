   "After the win at Dallas on Thanksgiving, the Broncos have shown they are a very good team. Their toughest game left is going into San Diego. But even if they lose that one the rest is smooth sailing and the Denver Broncos go 13-3 or 14-2. They are looking like the team that could challenge the Colts in the postseason. It's looking like a Colts-Broncos AFC championship and after 3 years of losing to the Colts in the playoffs they will finally reverse the trend and pull an upset over the (currently) undefeated Colts. They should have another challenge in Seattle for the Super Bowl but after the Colts they should handle the Seahawks, shutting down Shaun Alexander. Maybe that's just wishful thinking, but I can always hope.",
