   "Alrighty then. This is my \"*itch aboout New York\" thread because New York State is a shining example of Liberalism unleashed.\n \n Fact: New York is the Highest taxed state in the US\n \n Fact: New York has the creme' de la creme' of Welfare/Medicaid programs in the US\n \n Fact: New York has the lowest private sector job growth while at the same time, municipal employment has remained constant.\n \n (BTW, any other blue-state posters are invited to gripe about their home states as well.)\n \n Fact: Albany is in the pockets of the Downstate union bosses (what else is new)\n \n All this adds up to a population exodus of monumental proportions.\n \n Thoughts? Ideas? We are about to revert back to the good ol' days of Taxocrats running Albany \n \n http://www.business-opportunities.bi...ks-the-states/\n \n \n \n In contrast the most anti-entrepreneur policy environments are offered by the following:\n \n \n 37) North Carolina\n 38) Montana\n 39) Oregon\n 40) Ohio\n 41) Massachusetts\n 42) Vermont\n 43) Iowa\n 44) New Jersey\n 45) New York\n 46) Maine\n 47) Minnesota\n 48) Rhode Island\n 49) Hawaii\n 50) California\n 51) District of Columbia.\n \n \n \n http://www.taxfoundation.org/press/show/1369.html\n \n The ten states with the least hospitable business tax climates are: New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Ohio, Vermont, Maine, Kentucky, Nebraska, Iowa and Arkansas. \n \n \n \n http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/r-art...stax_ranking-i\n \n \n New York state once again finds itself dead last among all 50 states in a national report on the overall business-tax climate. \n \n \n \n \n \n http://www.osc.state.ny.us/osdc/rpt801/rpt801.htm\n \n \n \n From 1991 to 1999, State employment levels grew by a total of 7.2 percent, compared to a 19 percent gain nationally, placing the State 49th out of 50 states in the rate of employment growth.\n \n Nothing like liberal economic policies to completely gut and destroy a once vibrant economy, one that was by itself larger than many entire nations. Very soon the number of people contributing to our tax base will be overwhelmed by those sustaining themselves by it, if that isn't true already.",

But if anyone wants an example of a thoroughly screwed up state when it comes to taxes, come to Texas. The state legislature meets but once every two years and they usually make things worse. The worst example I can think of is that we have no state income tax and a very high real estate and sales tax. This is stupid in my view. One of the best systems I have seen was where I used to live in Missouri. We paid 1/2 of the sales taxes, 1/3 of the insurance costs and the state taxes were reasonably low. And the government for the most part was honest and responsive to the citizen's needs. I lived there for most of my life but left for a more hospitable climate in Texas. I have often expressed the point of view that we need to lower the sales and property taxes and institute a low state income tax. But it is a non-starter among the hard heads down here. But maybe that's a price to pay for the weather. We don't have to shovel heat.\n\n Mule, the problems New York has are these:\n \n 1) New York City: Siphons off the tax dollars from upstate\n \n 2) The most generous welfare/Medicaid programs in the country\n \n 3) Union pandering- typical, but when you have the highest concentration of unionized workers, well, you get the picture.",

I didn't know there was that much snow; in fact I thought it was somewhat mild. But we do agree that the beauty is unmatched.\n \n Well, in that case, and I don't know why I didn't mention this before, is in Arkansas. That state has beauty, and what appears to me to be prosperous around the Bentonville, Arkansas area. I once thought of retiring to Mountain View, Arkansas. My wife and I used to sit around and discuss places where we might want to retire and made several trips down there but finally ruled it out. When we moved to Texas we made several trips through the Bentonville area and was highly impressed. I spent 26 years in Springfield, Missouri but finally decided that I didn't want to deal with the snow and winters there. Amazing how much different 500 miles will make in the weather. At least we don't have to shovel snow here where we finally wound up.\n \n If a person wanted to live in Texas, I would recommend a good look at Tyler, Longview and Lufkin. Lufkin is particularly impressive in that while its population is only 32,000, the daily population is around 100,000 as people come there to work. There is shopping and restaurants galore. We often go there to shop and eat. I have often commented that had we looked there we would have bought there rather than where we live today. Many beautiful homes. But all-in-all, we're satisfied. This will be the sixth winter here and I've yet to pick up a snow shovel. No ice either. Occasionally gets cool and it does get hot in the summer but no place is perfect. I once thought that living in a secluded place like Yaak, Montana would be neat but fortunately I came to my senses. And I'm sure that it had plenty of snow.\n \n In any event, if I thought a state was thoroughly corrupt, had lousy winters and was generally in a hacked off mood, I would want live elsewhere. Life is too short to be in a perpetual funk.\n \n What about Pennsylvania? There is some beautiful country there as well.",
