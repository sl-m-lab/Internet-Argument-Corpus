Suppose the drunk guy plans to be picked up? Maybe the drunk guy wants to sober up before he goes home...States can be weird sometimes.",

What's next, reversion to private clubs or prohibition?\n\n I hauled a bottle or two in from Oklahoma back in those days, made some good dollars. I recall those days when we carried our brown paper sack with our booze into the clubs. Public intoxication has been on the books for some times, but the cops used to ignore it as long as the drunk caused no problems. Selling booze to or buying it for a drunk is also illegal here. Back in the day, many of my friends used to go to clubs for the express purpose of getting hammered. As a non-drinker, I was always the driver. I would make myself a drink with whiskey and coke, then top the original off with coke throughout the night. One night my friends conspired to get me drunk and kept adding booze to my drink. It was then that I discovered I was a friendly drunk that loves everybody. As a joke, my friends put my drunken body, minus my car keys and wallet, in a cheap motel ($2.50/night) with a girl from the club (she looked a lot like Danny DeVito). I woke up next morning, with Danny next to me, with no car and no money. - had to borrow a coin from the porter to call my so-called friends to rescue me.\n Dono",
