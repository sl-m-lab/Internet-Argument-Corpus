   "'Gays' in the Military: A Revival of The Pink Swastika?\n \n MEDIA ADVISORY, Jan. 27 /Christian Newswire/ -- \"Repealing the ban on open homosexuals serving in the U.S. military would be a mistake of historic proportions.\" warns a Massachusetts attorney and pastor who authored a book on homosexuality in Nazi Germany. Dr. Scott Lively is co-author, along with Jewish researcher Kevin E. Abrams, of The Pink Swastika: Homosexuality in the Nazi Party.\n \n \"Certainly there would be a mass exodus of normal men from a homosexualized military,\" said Lively, \"probably leading to the reinstatement of compulsory service. (Watch the anti-war Lefties become supporters of the draft when it's used to remedy \"homophobia\") And yes there would be severe morale problems for normal men forced to live as the objects of sexual interest of other men with whom they share close quarters. However, the much bigger, longer-term problem is the threat of a homosexual takeover of the military branches.\n \n \"Most people don't realize that male homosexuality does not always lean to the effeminate. Historically, male homosexuality was much more often associated with hyper-masculine warrior cults which were usually very brutal and very politically aggressive. The most recent example was in Germany. Hitler's initial power base when he launched the Nazi Party was a private homosexual military force organized and trained by a notorious pederast named Gerhard Rossbach. Rossbach's homosexual partner Ernst Roehm, who was also Hitler's partner in forming and building the Nazi Party, converted the \"gay\" Rossbachbund into the dreaded SA Brownshirts.\"\n \n \"Many of the [S.A.'s] top leaders, beginning with its chief, [Ernst] Roehm, were notorious homosexual perverts.\" wrote the preeminent historian of the Nazi era, William Shirer in The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\n \n \"Masculine-oriented male homosexuality tends also to be pederastic in nature,\" continued Lively, \"meaning that it often involves relationships between adult men and teenage boys. The ancient Spartan army, for example, drafted young teens boys and paired them with adult homosexual soldiers. Brownshirt leaders in Germany recruited boys from the local high schools for sex. Roehm himself once briefly fled Germany for South America over a scandal involving a young male prostitute. This bodes ill for the young men who will be our future draftees.\n \n \"Every effort should be taken to prevent this policy change,\" he said.'Gays' in the Military: A Revival of The Pink Swastika? - Christian Newswire\n \n Sometimes an article just speaks for itself.\n That such vile lies of bigotry would be present on a \"Christian Newswire\" service?\n \n And anybody who wonders how this organization is \"associated\", they can simply review their own web-page to see the referrals, accolades, and links to other Christian organizations...\n Christian Newswire - Up to the Minute Christian News\n \n I don't refute it cause I don't think it needs refuting.\n If anybody thinks any specific claims in this article have merit and need to be addressed, please make it known.",
