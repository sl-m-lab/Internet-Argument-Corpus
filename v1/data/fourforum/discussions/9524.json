   "In this post I'm going to expose the Great American Fossil Hoax, and make evolutionary scientists look like the complete fools they are. I'm going to quickly expose evolutionists' scam that there are any transitional fossils...and in the process I'm going to falsify human evolution.\n \n First of all, what you have to realize is even if there were transitional scientists would not be able to prove it. There have been billions of fossils dug up out of the ground. Even if science were able to line up a long, gradual lineage of fossils side by side, from smaller to larger, for example, they still would not be able to prove that one came from another. Heck, what if you had several corpses buried in your backyard from 500 years ago??...who's to say which came from which -- or even if they're related at all? The reality is, there's simply no way to prove it.\n \n please look at the following link:\n \n http://www.accessmylibrary.com/comsite5/bin/pdinventory.pl?pdlanding=1&referid=2930&purchase_type=ITM&item_id=0286-11970623\n \n From the smallest Chihuahua to the biggest Great Dane, all dogs emerge from the same basic set of genes.\n \n So, you have a tiny chihuahua compared to the huge Great Dane. Same genes. Think of all the different varieties and sizes of dogs in between. Likewise they most certainly have the same sets of genes. Now think about thousands of years. Who could ever tell if one dog is ancestral to another? Their size and shape obviously have nothing to do with genetics. I could line up the bones of a Chihuahua and then a cocker spaniel, and then a Labrador and then a great Dane and say, \"WALLAH, there you have it, Darwian evolution!\" That ain't how truth, logic, and scientific honesty works! Yet, that's exactly what evolutionists do!\n \n The reality is a change in phenotype is observed as evolution in the fossil record. But there is no way to tell from the fossils whether the changes in continuous records were caused by variation arising in the genotype or only in the phenotype. We all know now that the environment plays a role in expressing genes (you do know that genes can't turn themselves On and Off, don't you?)....thus a change in environment may alter the phenotype of the organism, yet there would be NO MUTATION and NO SELECTION. Do you simple-minded evolutionists get this very simple concept? The logical person can't help but ponder how much of the fossil record has been misconstrued by desperate evolutionists as examples of Darwinian evolution when it was nothing more than a phenotypic expression without any change in the genotype.\n \n But it gets better. Everyone knows how evolutionists like to dig up human bones and compare and contrast their different sizes and shapes...and everyone knows how they then make evolutionary assumptions based on these physical appearances. Heck, the changes in human appearance over time IS evolution....it is THE scientific method.\n \n I have long argued on here that this is a racist mindset. To label and judge people based on their physical characteristics is, in my opinion, immoral. But science, to this very day, continues scouring the earth looking for fossil humans so they can label and (mis)characterize their bones. But it turns out that each human being's physiology has nothing to do with evolution -- it has nothing to do with genes -- but simply represents the adaptability of the human genome to the local environment.\n \n The reality is, despite height, skin color or skull volume, the human race is only one race -- the human race....and genetics has virtually NOTHING to do with physical appearance:\n \n http://www.augsburg.edu/education/edc210/race-myth.html\n \n \"Science got us into this problem in the first place, with its measurements of skulls and its emphasis on racial differences and racial classifications,\" he said. \"Scientists should now get us out of it.\"\n \n Venter and scientists at the National Institutes of Health recently announced that they had put together a draft of the entire sequence of the human genome, and the researchers unanimously declared that there is only one race -- the human race.\n \n Most scientists in the field say that those traits most commonly used to distinguish one race from another, such as skin and eye color, or the width of the nose, are traits controlled by a relatively few number of genes, and have changed rapidly in response to extreme environmental pressures during the short history of Homo sapiens.\n \n \"If you ask what percentage of your genes is reflected in your external appearance, the basis by which we talk about race, the answer seems to be in the range of 0.01 percent,\" said Dr. Harold Freeman, the chief executive, president and director of surgery at North General Hospital in New York City, who has studied the issue of biology and race. \"This is a very, very minimal reflection of your genetic makeup.\"\n and another:\n \n http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/genomics/1_identity/ninety_nine.html\n \n No Biological Basis for Race\n \n Look around you: no two people are exactly alike. But believe it or not, we all share 99.9% of the same DNA.\n \n New data from the mapping of the human genome reveal that all humans are incredibly similar-in fact, we are 99.9% genetically identical. We are all members of one species, Homo sapiens. Scientists have confirmed, as they long suspected, that there is no genetic or biological basis for race. \n \n No matter how scientists today scrutinize a person's genes, they can't determine with certainty whether an individual is from one \"racial\" group or another. Differences of culture and society distinguish one group from another, but these distinctions are not rooted in biology.\n \n \n So if outward appearance including skull size and shape, nose size, bone density, etc are not a reflection of our genetic makeup, then why do scientists make evoluitonary assumptions based on the shape of one's skull when they dig it up out of the ground???? How could they ever make evolutionary assumptions about any fossil if such traits can be modified by environment? \n \n Look at the following link:\n \n http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/0103109.html\n \n But we are just beginning to understand an unexpected new paradigm: certain genes that regulate phenotypes-groups of physiological traits and behaviors-are actually under social control. A genome, the complete collection of an organism's genes, is plastic, Hofmann contends. The environment-even social and cultural contexts-can switch genes on and off.\n \n He goes on to say that up to 14 different phenotypic expressions are controlled by the environment or social control. Any of these expressions could be viewed as examples of darwinian evolution if haphazardly observed over a period of years in the wild. But this guy shows that selection had nothing to do with the phenotypic changes, instead they're just morphological phenomenons that had nothing at all to do with mutations or genes.\n \n Yet, evolutionists, for years have been attempting to claim that certain fossils are transitionals, or that there are actually gradual lineages, no doubt accomplished by darwinian mechanisms. This is nothing but wishful thinking, speculation, and a desire/need to fool the public. \n \n The reality is, the thousands of varied physical features, such as shapes of eyes, ears, nose, mouth, height, bone structure, body shape, and other characteristics....just like in dogs....are all controlled in the same way, by the same genes being modified by the environment.\n \n And since genes cannot be tied to physical traits, this effectively falsifies the current scientific explanation of human evolution.\n \n The \"evolution\" of humans is a FRAUD masquerading as science and you evolutionists are continuing to fool yourselves if you believe otherwise. Science has TRICKED you.\n \n The fossil record does not prove evolution. The fossil record proves nothing. Any \"proof\" of evolution would have to come from somewhere else. Of course, proof and valid evidence for evolution always comes from somewhere else.\n \n Race is a social concept, not a scientific one,\" said Dr. J. Craig Venter, head of the Celera Genomics Corp. in Rockville, Md.\n \n Oh, but it gets better. \n \n http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=416674&in_page_id=1770&ct=5\n \n Human and Neanderthal DNA 99.9% identical\n \n Dr Edward Rubin, one of the US and German researchers who have started to sequence the ancient DNA, said: 'We are at the dawn of Neanderthal genomics. \n \n Fossil remains have already shown that Neanderthals looked different from us, with heavy brows, low foreheads, and receding chins. They were also much more robustly built than modern humans. \n \n lol!!!! So now, instead of genes, science is rearing it's ugly racist head and proclaiming that Neanderthals were a different species not because of their genes, but because of the shape of their skull and their receding chins! \n \n Racist Pigs.\n \n The theory of evolution is just so sad and pathetic....it's hanging on by life support and nothing else.... It just makes you want to shoot it in the head like a sick, rabid animal to quickly put it out of its misery.",

Scientists don't make any judgements about whether Homo sapiens should rule over Homo erectus, due to the fact it's a) pointless, and b) not scientific. \n \n Making a judgement about a skull, based on its cranial capacity, and on its general morphology is perfectly normal, and is something we do looking at animals all the time (humans are also animals, before you start the God-drivel). Scientists are merely studying their position relative to modern H sapiens, whereas you seem to be assuming that those things lower down the tree are sub-human. What does that make you? \n \n \nHow could they possibly construct a human phylogenetic tree if traits are modified by enviornment, not dictated by randomly mutating genes?\n \n \n As has been explained to you before, the expression of the genes in the different environment is what leads to the selection process. A phylogenetic tree simply tracks the emergence of phenotypes (which in turn can be said to track the appearance of new geneotypes). Simply, phylogenetic relationships merely track degree of shared characters. There's no connotation of superiority as you assert...\n \n \nHow can the pigs in science proclaim that Neandethals were a different \"species\" based not on their genes -- which are 99.9% similar as ours -- but their receding chin and large skull? \n\n \n The 'pigs' in science proclaim Neanderthals are a different species due to the broad morphological differences (more than just skull characteristics), due to thier different lifestyles (from the archaeological evidence) and thier different movement histories. The former of these is the more important, but the latter can be argued to be contributing factors.\n \n \nEvolutionary science is full of nothing but good-for-nothing, \n\n Given your contribution to the world of knowledge, that's not really much of an insult...\n \n \nmonkey-loving, \n\n Are you planning on explaining what the problem you have with monkeys is?

He claimed that the bombardier beetle would explode because of two chemicals that it produces, hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide, and then mixes. Gish either forgot or didn't know about the catalases and peroxidases that are also produced, and instead either invented an inhibitor or was also duped into believing that one was present.

Nor are races marked by important differences in gene frequencies, the rates of appearance of certain gene types.

That is, greater genetic variation exists within the populations typically labeled Black and White than between these populations. This finding refutes the supposition that racial divisions reflect fundamental genetic differences. \n \n \n Along the way, various minds tried to fashion practical human typologies along the following physical axes: skin color, hair texture, facial angle, jaw size, cranial capacity, brain mass, frontal lobe mass, brain surface fissures and convolutions, and even body lice. As one scholar notes, \"[t]he nineteenth century was a period of exhaustive and--as it turned out--futile search for criteria to define and describe race differences.\". . . Attempts to define racial categories by physical attributes ultimately failed. By 1871, some leading intellectuals had recognized that even using the word \"race\" \"was virtually a confession of ignorance or evil intent.\" The genetic studies of the last few decades have only added more nails to the coffin of biological race. Evidence shows that those features usually coded to race, for example, stature, skin color, hair texture, and facial structure, do not correlate strongly with genetic variation\n ",

Me and a Chimp might both have a gene that codes for sections of protein A, B, C and D - however when I express them I arrange them ABDC and he arranges them ABCD. In actual fact its probably closer to me arranging them ACD, ABD and CDC to get three different proteins whilst the chimp has ACD, CDB, CDC as well ACB - we share 100% of the DNA here, but we express them very differently due to slight changes to the sections of DNA than controls expression of this 'gene'.\n \n As for being unable to predict race with DNA, that is like asking a physist to tell you whether something is orange or red just from the wavelength of light absorbed, or a chemist to tell you whether a cake will be tasty based of the molecular structure.

The older value of 1.5 percent is a measure of the difference between equivalent genes in humans and chimps, like a difference in the spelling of the same word in two similar languages. Based on that figure, experts proposed that humans and chimps have essentially the same genes, but differed in when and where the genes turn on and off.\n \n The new research takes into account the possibility for multiple copies of genes and that the number of copies can differ between species, even though the gene itself is the same or nearly so. \"You have to pay attention to more than just the genes that are shared,\" says geneticist Matthew Hahn of Indiana University, Bloomington, lead author of the new report. Researchers believe that additional copies of the same gene allow evolution to experiment, so to speak, finding new functions for old genes.\nNote that the line you quoted was deliberately written in the past tense, the effect of which your dishonest quote mine eliminated.

I've also found that many college profs and researchers don't mind answering questions by email, so if you have a local college, or if you read a paper you don't understand, find an email address and fire off a couple questions. I've done this myself when I came across a paper on the net that I had questions with. I emailed one of the authors asking him if he could \"dumb it down\" for me, and he was happy to do so. I ended up trading emails off and on with him for the better part of a year, and learned a lot about cosmology and black hole theories that I didn't understand before. If you don't understand how your faith and science can be reconciled, I'd reccomend speaking with your local priest. \n \n But the greatest piece of advice is this-don't listen to what others tell you. Make up your own mind, but only after weighing all the evidence. Deciding on the right answer then looking for evidence to support it (or ignoring evidence that contradicts your preconceived notions) is not only wrong, it's lunacy.",

   "Correction... 99.9% of the DNA between humans and neanderthals cannot be the same, due to the fact that two traits, genotypes, and phenotypes may appear identical, but they are not identical since they are different genes.\nFirst, genotype and phenotype are not \"traits.\" Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an organism. To say that the DNA of humans and neandertals is 99.9% the same (whether it is true or not) is a statement that the genotypes differ by 0.1%. Therefore, if we are stating that they are different, they cannot \"appear\" identical. On the other hand, the phenotype of an organism is its physical appearance that results from the genotype. Two different genotypes might appear phenotypically identical. For example, when considering the color of peppered moths (Biston betularia), a heterozygous individual is indistinguishable from a homozygous dark individual. Your statement is mostly nonsense since by definition, two genotypes that differ by 99.9% are not the same. And two phenotypes that are the same can result from different genotypes.\n \nTherefore, you cannot compare the DNA of humans and neanderthals and say that it is very similar. Basic genetics...\nYour objection is basic nonsense. We most certainly can compare the DNA of humans and neandertals. So far we don't have the complete neandertal genome decoded. It may be possible in the future, but maybe not. We do know that there are distinct differences between neandertal mtDNA and human mtDNA such that neandertals are not ancestral to modern humans, nor modern humans to neandertals.\n \nWanna bet?\nYeah. I do. I taught this stuff enough to recognize that your misconceptions and your banter are based on ignorance. It reminds me of students who didn't study for exams and tried to snow their way through by misusing big words that they didn't understand. So, to reiterate;\nYou clearly know nothing of basic genetics. Please stop pretending.\n\n \nThere could be only one letter/gene from the human genetic code that is different from the neanderthal genetic code, which could make that 1% seem like a lot.\nMore misunderstanding on your part. Usually, when one talks about a \"letter\" in the genetic code, one would be talking about a single base pair. Thus, any reference to a single base pair difference as comprising a 1% difference in a genome of about 3 billion base pairs is pure nonsense, yeah verily, gibberish. You didn't do well in math class either, did you? Even if we allow for your incorrect equivalence of \"gene\" (these percentage differences usually refer to base pairs - I would have to read the paper upon which you base your statements), that represents about 3,000 genes that don't exist in modern humans.\n \nWhich would make humans and neanderthals different, because of the \"one gene swap\", so to speak, if this were to happen.\nBut of course, it isn't one gene. On the other hand, it probably isn't 3,000 either. I don't know the exact percentage - that would depend on how it is determined. But some genes have more effect than others and a change that might seem insignificant could change how other genes interact. Recent research into the proteomes of various organisms has shown that these differences are far more numerous than the differences in the genomes.\n \n I'm sure that, since you are so knowledgeable in genetics, that none of those words causes you the slightest pause.\n \nI am saying that even 1% or .1% of a difference between humans and neanderthals is a very large difference, when you take the genetic codes and such into consideration.\nBut the 1% or 0.1% difference is in consideration of the genetic code. That's what it means. It is nonsense to state that some percentage difference in the genetic code is meaningful when you take the genetic code into consideration. You are just giving us a snow job in an effort to pass.\n \nSo therefore, humans and neanderthals may appear identical, but their genetic codes, phenotypes, and genotypes prove otherwise that their gene make-up is not the same.\nMore gibberish. Modern humans and neandertals (they were human as far as I know) did not appear identical. Their genetic codes (that is to say, genotype), phenotype (that is to say, appearance) and genotypes (redundant = genetic code) shows that not only were they not identical, they were not the same species.",

Mostly insects I think, there were some mosquitos in the London underground that adapted to feed off rats rather than pigeons and no longer breed with the original pigeon 'eating' population.\n \n Disease today is tied up closely with the concept of evolution on a couple of fronts - firstly with bacteria and viruses evolving to become resistant to medicines, knowing how and why this happens is critical when devising treatments and estimating whether or not a new drug is going to be feasible.

   "Actually there are many examples of evolution that have been recorded - we're talking infering that evolution has occured by comparing various fossils to modern animals but actually observing a population of animals or plants change in such a way that they stop breeding with each other, and even become unable to breed with each other. Mostly insects I think, there were some mosquitos in the London underground that adapted to feed off rats rather than pigeons and no longer breed with the original pigeon 'eating' population.\n \n Disease today is tied up closely with the concept of evolution on a couple of fronts - firstly with bacteria and viruses evolving to become resistant to medicines, knowing how and why this happens is critical when devising treatments and estimating whether or not a new drug is going to be feasible. Additionally, our knowledge of evolution can be used to find new targets - some proteins are highly conserved in most organisms, if a drug can target these safely then you are much less likely to get resistant strains evolving. \n \n Its also part of a bigger problem - as you've seen in a lot of these threads, people like Supersport have no respect for science and wish other people would stop listening to scientists over priests.

They describe the findings in detail, fail to interpret them correctly, and avoid discussing their practical implications, dismissing incriminating evidence. They try desperately to paper over the cracks of the crumbling edifice and engage in rampant speculations. Dr. Mae-Wan Ho challenges these scientists to tell the truth, to themselves and to the public.\n \n Horizontal gene transfer - the transfer of genes across distinct species including those in different kingdoms - goes counter to modern genetics and to the theory of evolution. In the case of evolution, both the general theory of evolution - that different organisms descended with modification from earlier common ancestors - and the special neo-Darwinian theory - that organisms evolve by the natural selection of random genetic mutations - are under threat.\n \n In 1859, the year that Charles Darwin's Origin of Species took Victorian Britain by storm, Gregor Mendel in Brno, also published his work, which, according to Darwin's followers would have supplied the mechanism of heredity that was lacking from Darwin's theory. It took more than 40 years to the beginning of the last century before Mendel's work was rediscovered to inaugurate the search for the material basis of heredity. As everyone knows, that search culminated in the triumphant discovery of the DNA double-helix. \n \n The significance of DNA for neo-Darwinism is encapsulated in Francis Crick's statement of the 'Central Dogma' of molecular biology: that 'genetic information' flows in one direction only from DNA to RNA to protein, and never in reverse. The Central Dogma lends support to the most hard line genetic determinist assumptions of neo-Darwinism:\n \n Genes determine characters in a straightforward, additive way: one gene-one protein, and by implication, one character. Environmental influence, if any, can be neatly separated from the genetic. \n Genes and genomes are stable, and except for rare, random mutations, are passed on unchanged to the next generation. \n Genes and genomes cannot be changed directly in response to the environment. \n Acquired characters are not inherited. \n The first assumption has been severely criticised since modern genetics began. Many biologists including Richard Goldsmith and later, C.H. Waddington have pointed to the large influence that the environment has on development, and that the effects of genes and the environment cannot be disentangled. But discoveries of the complex gene-protein relationship and the fluidity of the genome within the past twenty years have really blown that assumption apart.\n \n Horizontal gene transfer - a key process of the fluid genome - makes neo-Darwinism untenable in perhaps the most explicit fashion. It means that genes and genomes are not stable, that 'characters', encoded by genes, can be acquired under certain environmental conditions, and can be inherited.\"\n -------------------------\n \n read this too, punk:\n \n http://www.trueorigin.org/bacteria01.asp",

Here we explain why we foresee such a dramatic transformation, and why we believe the molecular reductionism that dominated twentieth-century biology will be superseded by an interdisciplinary approach that embraces collective phenomena.\n \n It is becoming clear that microorganisms have a remarkable ability to reconstruct their genomes in the face of dire environmental stresses, and that in some cases their collective interactions with viruses may be crucial to this. In such a situation, how valid is the very concept of an organism in isolation? It seems that there is a continuity of energy flux and informational transfer from the genome up through cells, community, virosphere and environment.\n \n The fundamental role of translation, represented in particular by the genetic code, is shown by the clearly documented optimization of the code.

   "Here's another hoax perpetrated by evolutionist Dawson back around 1910. It took 5 decades before being discovered and was even used as evidence in the famous Scopes Trial which furthered the false science of evolution. I can't post the link so here's the article in its entirety. \n \n Piltdown hoax\n \n Piltdown was an archaeological site in England where in 1908 and 1912 human, ape and other mammal fossils were found together. In 1913 at a nearby site was found an ape's jaw with a canine tooth worn down like a human's. The general community of British paleoanthropologists came to accept the idea that the fossil remains belonged to a single creature that had had a human cranium and an ape's jaw. In 1953, Piltdown 'man' was exposed as a forgery. The skull was modern and the teeth on the ape's jaw had been filed down.\n \n To those who are skeptical of science, such as Charles Fort and the Forteans, such episodes as Piltdown are taken to be proof that science is, more or less, bunk. To those who have a better understanding of the nature and limits of science, Piltdown is little more than a wrong turn down a series of roads which, despite such detours, eventually arrives at the right destination.\n \n How had so many scientists been duped? Stephen Jay Gould offers several reasons, among them wishful thinking and cultural bias. The latter, no doubt, played a role in the lack of critical thinking among British paleoanthropologists. But, above all, the Piltdown forgery demonstrates the fallibility of scientific knowledge. It demonstrates, too, the way theories and facts are related in science. Theories are the filters through which facts are interpreted (Popper). Theories try to explain and make sense of facts. On the other hand, facts are used to test theories. Gould notes that today a human cranium with an ape's jaw is considered to be extremely implausible and far-fetched. But in the early part of this century, anthropologists were imbued with the cultural prejudice which considered man's big brain as his ticket to rule, the main evolutionary feature that made it possible for man to develop all his other unique features. Since there was a pre-conceived notion that man's brain must have developed to its human size before other changes occurred in human structure, a human cranium with an ape's jaw didn't arouse as much suspicion as it would today. Fossil discoveries since Piltdown clearly show a progression from small-brained but upright, hence non-simian hominids, to larger-brained upright humans. Scientists \"modeled the facts\" and confirmed their theory, \"another illustration,\" says Gould, \"that information always reaches us through the strong filters of culture, hope, and expectation\" (Gould 1982, p. 118). Once committed to a theory, we see what fits with the theory.\n \n The main reason Piltdown was not spotted as a fraud much earlier was that scientists weren't allowed to see the evidence, which was kept securely locked in the British Museum. Instead of focusing their attention on examining the \"facts\" more closely with an eye to discovering the fraud, scientists weren't even allowed to examine the physical evidence at all! They had to deal with plaster molds and be satisfied with a quick look at the originals to justify the claim that the models were accurate.\n \n Another reason some scientists were duped was probably because it was not in their nature to consider someone would be so malicious as to intentionally engage in such deception. In any case, one of the main fallouts of Piltdown has been a virtual industry of detectives trying to identify the hoaxer. The list of suspects includes:\n \n Charles Dawson, an amateur archaeologist who brought in the first cranial fragments from Piltdown;\n \n Tielhard de Chardin, theologian and scientist who accompanied Dawson and Arthur Smith Woodward (Keeper of Geology at the British Museum [Natural History] in 1912) to Piltdown on expeditions where they discovered the mandible;\n \n W.J. Solass, a professor of geology at Oxford;\n \n Grafton Elliot Smith, who wrote a paper on the find in 1913;\n \n Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes; and\n \n Martin A.C. Hinton, a curator of zoology at the time of the Piltdown hoax. A trunk with Hinton's initials on it was found in an attic of London's Natural History Museum. The trunk contained bones stained and carved in the same way as the Piltdown fossils.\n \n The evidence in each case is circumstantial and not very strong. What is highly probable is that there will be more books speculating on the identity of the Piltdown hoaxer.\n \n the moral of Piltdown\n \n The moral of Piltdown is that science is a fallible, human activity which does not always take the most direct route in fulfilling its aim of understanding nature. When an anomaly such as the discovery of a human cranium with an ape's jaw occurs one must either fit it into a new theory, re-examine the evidence for error in discovery or interpretation, or show that the so-called anomaly is not really an anomaly at all but in fact fits with current theory. Which route a scientist takes may be guided more by personal hopes and cultural prejudices than by some mythical objectivity characterized by the collection and accumulation of colorless, impersonal facts to be pigeonholed dogmatically into a General Theory of Objective Truth and Knowledge.\n \n But to characterize scientists as arrogant buffoons making claims that often turn out to be false, and to make a caricature out of science because it is not infallible and does not arrive at absolutely certain claims, belies a grave misunderstanding of the nature of science. The buffoons are those who demand absolute certainty where none can be had; the buffoons are those who do not understand the value and beauty of probabilities in science. The arrogant ones are those who think that science is mere speculation because scientists make errors, even egregious errors, or at times even commit fraud to push their prejudices. The arrogant ones are those who can't tell the difference between a testable and an untestable hypothesis and who think one speculation is as good as another. The buffoons are those who think that since both scientists and creationists or other pseudoscientists pose theories, each is doing essentially the same thing. However, all theories are not empirical, and of those that are empirical not all are equally speculative. Furthermore, those creationists who think that Piltdown demonstrates that scientists can't accurately date bones should remember that methods of dating such things have greatly improved since 1910.*\n \n Because of the public nature of science and the universal application of its methods, and because of the fact that the majority of scientists are not crusaders for their own untested or untestable prejudices, as many pseudoscientists are, whatever errors are made by scientists are likely to be discovered by other scientists. The discovery will be enough to get science back on track. The same can't be said for the history of quacks and pseudoscientists where errors do not get detected because their claims are not tested properly. And when critics identify errors, they are ignored by true believers.\n \n (note: Yet another book on the Piltdown hoax has been published since the Hinton trunk discovery. Unraveling Piltdown: The Science Fraud of the Century and Its Solution by John Evangelist Walsh (Random House, 1996) points the finger at Dawson once again.)",

The real quarrel is the issue of how much human behaviour, in every arena, today and in the future, is to be determined by one worldview as opposed to another one that is clearly antithetical to the first. \n \n This is very serious business that cannot be lightly dismissed. As many y wars have been fought over such ideological quarrels as have ever been fought over plunder and real estate. The reason being that ideology creates political power and self-righteous ego-satisfaction through collective identification with a group, and power and egoism are what human beings really fight for, from schoolyard squabbles to nuclear armageddon.\n \n This division of human worldview is extremely serious, as any analysis of what is misleadingly called, 'the war on ', must tell you. And it is not going to be solved by appeals to mystical but undetectable father-figures in the sky, nor by appeals to mystical and unpredictable happenstance brought about in some vague, nebulous fashion by bits of stuff flying about for unknown and unknowable reasons.\n \n What is necessary to spare us untold shed and the destruction of the only biosphere known to exist in the entire universe, is a reconciliation between these two metaphysical positions, and to do that large chunks of both simply have to be dropped and replaced by something better.

   "Wow, this new arguement has completely convinced me. Thanks Archangel!\n \n We'll just ignore how Piltdown man was marginalized decades before it was outed because it didn't fit with existing knowledge. We'll also ignore that it was the same scientists you villify who actually uncovered, and announced, the hoax.\n \n I do like this though:\n \"But to characterize scientists as arrogant buffoons making claims that often turn out to be false, and to make a caricature out of science because it is not infallible and does not arrive at absolutely certain claims, belies a grave misunderstanding of the nature of science. The buffoons are those who demand absolute certainty where none can be had; the buffoons are those who do not understand the value and beauty of probabilities in science. The arrogant ones are those who think that science is mere speculation because scientists make errors, even egregious errors, or at times even commit fraud to push their prejudices. The arrogant ones are those who can't tell the difference between a testable and an untestable hypothesis and who think one speculation is as good as another. The buffoons are those who think that since both scientists and creationists or other pseudoscientists pose theories, each is doing essentially the same thing. However, all theories are not empirical, and of those that are empirical not all are equally speculative. Furthermore, those creationists who think that Piltdown demonstrates that scientists can't accurately date bones should remember that methods of dating such things have greatly improved since 1910.*\"\n \n You must be taking lessons from SS. Your article states the opposite of what you thought it did.\n\n \n Excuses, excuses, excuses. Nothing but excuses. The point is that falsifying info and results has happened many times in the evolutionary search for how man became man.\n \n The Latest Evolution Fraud!\n \n \n I can remember as a child flicking through the pages of National Geographic Magazines. I didn't realize at the time, that I was filling my mind full with the evolution myth. Recently, we have seen another example of the evolution hoax being publicized in beautiful living color on excellent quality glossy pages.\n In the November 1999 issue of National Geographic, we encounter \"Archaeoraptor\", the latest in the never ending series of supposed missing links. A fossil was supposedly discovered in Liaoning, China, which had a reptile like head, feathers, wings and body, like a bird, and the tail of a reptile. And, by the way, the find was made by two scientists who just happened to be funded by National Geographic!\n \n Usually it takes quite a few years to debunk one of these frauds, but this one fell apart rather quickly. Upon close examination, it was found that some of the bones, which should be between the tail and the body, were missing.\n \n We know now that two separate rock slabs containing fossils had been joined together. So we don't have a missing link at all. We have fossils of two different animals cleverly joined together. And, by the way, the feathers weren't feathers either! It is not suggested here that the National Geographic perpetrated the fraud. It is suggested that, in their zeal to spread the evolution myth, they allowed themselves to be duped by a rather simple fraud.\n \n A Science News writer, describing the situation in January, 2000 as follows:\n \n \n \" Red-faced and downhearted, paleontologists are growing convinced that they have been snookered by a bit of fossil fakery from China. The 'feathered dinosaur' specimen that they recently unveiled to much fanfare apparently combines the tail of a dinosaur with the body of a bird...!\"\n \n And here's more...\n \n History of hoaxes\n This wouldn't be the first time that National Geographic, in its eagerness to proselytise for the evolutionary faith, has rushed into print with 'evidence' that has turned out to be a hoax or an overblown claim that was later discredited. Many years ago, the magazine had a glossy picture displaying amazing artistic licence of our supposed ancestor, the 'missing link' Zinjanthropus boisei or 'Nutcracker man', discovered by Louis Leakey.12 Now no evolutionist would claim that this robust australopithecine was a human ancestor-see Marvin Lubenow's book Bones of Contention.\n Some atheistic/evolutionary/sceptical/anti-Christian websites are, amazingly, trying to downplay the Archaeoraptor fiasco, by pointing out that it was 'science' that put it right. Of course, they deceitfully equate 'science' and 'evolution', although evolutionary wishful thinking was responsible for the hoax in the first place! And now they tell us that NG is a popular general interest magazine and not a peer-reviewed scientific journal-not a peep from them while NG's shameless evolutionary sensationalizing remained unexposed!\n \n And here's more...\n \n 'Nebraska Man' revisited\n by Ian Taylor\n More about 'Nebraska man'-that now-discarded pig's tooth that was reconstructed by some to look as though it came from a primitive evolutionary 'ape-man'.\n When Dr Henry Fairfield Osborn, head of the Department of Palaeontology at New York's American Museum of Natural History received the fossil tooth in February 1922, he would have thought it a gift from the gods had he believed in any god at all. Marxist in his views and prominent member of the American Civil Liberties Union, he was aware that plans were being made by the union to challenge the Christian-backed legislation that forbade the teaching of evolution in American schools. He saw the tooth as precious evidence for the test case which was eventually held in 1925 at Dayton, Tennessee, and became known as the 'Scopes Monkey Trial'.\n The trial was an arranged affair, but the tooth was not brought in as evidence because there was dissension. The truth leaked out slowly and obscurely in the American Museum Novitiates for January 6, 1923, where nine authorities cited their objections to the claim that the tooth was anywhere near related to the primate. A further search was made at Snake Creek, the site of the original discovery, and by 1927 it was begrudgingly concluded that the tooth was that of a species of Prosthennops, an extinct genus related to the modern peccary or wild pig. These facts were not considered generally newsworthy but did appear in Science (1927, 66:579). The fourteenth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1929, 14:767) coyly admitted that a mistake had been made and that the tooth belonged to a 'being of another order'. The burden of embarrassment was thus eased for the now retired Henry Fairfield Osborn.\n This is not the whole story, however. While the pundits dismissed the affair, believing that the tooth was that of an extinct pig, in 1972 Ralph Wetzel discovered a herd of these very animals alive and well in Paraguay's Chaco. Wetzel gave a complete description of the discovery in Science (1975, 189:379), where the animals were consigned to the genus Catagonus ameghino. It was admitted, however, that this new species is similar to the extinct species Catagonus wagneri. Once again, the fossil record becomes a mere yesterday.\n \n I guess if the truth means nothing then evolution is just fine. But if one is truly seeking real answers to hard questions about human origins then they must create a system that rewards the truth and not the preconceived outcome they decide on in advance which motivates these so called scientists to create outcomes that allow for Grants and Prestigious Awards in order to further their careers.",

The titanic was a steel-hulled ship made of overlapping 1 inch thick plates, fastened by by millions of rivets. (I find it ironic that you mention the Titanic as an example of something that can float). The QM2 and all other ocean liners are also made of steel. A large wooden ship (as large as the ark) would break up. It is not due to the design. \n \n The basic limiting factor is the Modulus of Elasticity (stress/strain). Wood's limit tops out around 2,000,000 pounds per square inch. Steel is nearly 15 to 16 times that. With the weight of the cargo pushing down, and the water pressure pushing up, the wooden structure flexes 15 times as much as steel. The gaps between the planks would become huge, causing leaking and failure.\n \n Wood also absorbs water and loses strength. The nails fastening it together would undergo the flexing, creating holes that become wider and wider until they fall out. It might technically be possible to build a wooden ship as large as the ark, however, it would be filled entirely with internal structure to support it, and there would be no cargo space whatsoever.",

   "Wow... I've got a lot of catching up to do. Fortunately, SP and E have done a nice job on the main points.\n \njust to take an example off that page -- wisdom teeth -- I can show how our diets are causing our brains -- and no-doubt our skulls -- to shrink.\n\n But no responses to the two examples I chose... It looks like you are avoiding the question.\n \nDid you know depression causes the brain to shrink? How about chronic back pain? How about stress? How about a diet high in sugar and inflammatory foods? How about Alzheimers disease? All these cause the brain to shrink and change shape. Ultimately this is how our physiology changed from the days of the Neanderthals. The reality is, they were normal -- or at least closer to the shape of how we were created.... its us who have evolved new and strange shapes.\n\n I noticed one relevant link in your other thread, which mentioned a link between stress and smaller brains.\n What it did not mention was Alzheimer's, sugar, \"inflammatory\" foods, or any of the other examples you gave.\n \n I also find it funny that you admit that we have evolved. I thought you would try to use your plasticity misinterpretation.\n \nThink about it... There is proof of Noah's ark, from some debris found of the remains of a colossal wooden ship, da*ing back to more then 2 millenia ago. There is proof that Jesus Christ was in fact real and did live, and there is also proof of his Ascension into Heaven, so therefore, since these as well as more things from the Bible have been proven, Creationism can be proven as well.\n\n In that case, prove that Jesus existed, that Noah's ark existed, and that Creationism is correct.\n \nI beg to differ...\n \n There are some flaws with the big bang theory here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_Theory#Features.2C_issues_and_problems\n\n That makes no difference. It does not support creationism, and it is not the only scientific explanation for the beginning of the universe.\n \nI never have actually seen the movie, but from reviews on the movie, they do state that there is some fact in the movie.\n\n And there is some fact in the Da Vinci Code, as well as this movie. You'll have to do better than that.\n \nA wooden ship of that size can float. Wood floats. Look at other ships like the Titanic or that new cruise ship called the Queen Mary 2.\n\n I have a bit of reading for you to do before you try to argue for Noah's ark based on scientific evidence.\n \nThere are some people out there that are stubborn, like me, and that will never be converted to believing in theory of evolution. So stop trying... Facts don't prove a thing unless the \"puzzle\" is totally and officially complete. Good luck with that.\n\n And good luck explaining the imperfect universe created by a \"perfect\" god.\n \nIt's called a miracle... I guess you're not a big fan of the Bible.\n\n So if I have faith that miracles happen, then it becomes plausible to believe in miracles?\n Circular logic will get you nowhere, and it is why I don't care about having a pro-creation argument in my signature.\n \nHey, I only tried to give you evidence because you asked for it. As I am saying for the 3rd time, it's almost impossible to convert me, so don't even try with your meaningless facts that mean nothing to me.\n\n They may have no meaning to you, but they have meaning nonetheless.\n \nGreat Minds?! On what account? lol\n\n If you want to make ad hominem arguments, do so in a relevant way and within a relevant post.\n On second thought, an ad hominem argument is irrelevant by definition, so try to avoid them entirely.",
