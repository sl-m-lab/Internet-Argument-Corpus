   "No, you are not addressing the fact that all ways in which homosexuality is a benefit to humanity are based on social factors.

A bit like demanding a \"research article\" on the earth revolving around the sun, when the current research has progressed MUCH BEYOND that simple recognition.\n They are researching WHY and WHAT MEANS this behavior is exhibiting itself...\n \n You don't need to claim to have gone over \"body weight in biology/ecology books and papers\" in order to see this. You can just go to wikipedia and they will talk about the wide variety of ways it is seen and documented. * Male penguin couples have been documented to mate for life, build nests together, and to use a stone as a surrogate egg in nesting and brooding. In 2004, the Central Park Zoo in the United States replaced one male couple's stone with a fertilized egg, which the couple then raised as their own offspring.[38] German and Japanese zoos have also reported homosexual behaviour among their penguins. This phenomenon has also been reported at Kelly Tarlton's Aquarium in Auckland, New Zealand. \"Humans have created the myth that sexuality can be justified only by reproduction, which by definition limits it to hetero sex,\" says Michael Bronski, author of The Pleasure Principle: Culture, Backlash, and the Struggle for Gay Freedom. \"But here is an animal society that uses homosexuality to improve its social life.\"\n * Mounting of one female by another is common among cattle. (See also, Freemartin. Freemartins occur because of clearly causal hormonal factors at work during gestation.)\n * Bonobos in zoos. After studying the primates for his book Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape, primatologist Frans de Waal, a professor of psychology at Emory University in Atlanta, says that such expressions of intimacy are consistent with the homosexual behaviour of what he terms \"the erotic champions of the world.\" \"Same-sex, opposite-sex &#8212; bonobos just love sex play,\" de Waal said in an interview. \"They have so much sex, it gets boring.\"\n * Homosexual behaviour in male sheep (found in 6-10% of rams) is associated with variations in cerebral mass distribution and chemical activity. A study reported in Endocrinology concluded that biological and physiological factors are in effect.[39] These findings are similar to human findings reported by Simon LeVay.\n \n Approximately eight percent of [male] rams exhibit sexual preferences [that is, even when given a choice] for male partners (male-oriented rams) in contrast to most rams, which prefer female partners (female-oriented rams). We identified a cell group within the medial preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus of age-matched adult sheep that was significantly larger in adult rams than in ewes...\n \n * Male bighorn sheep are divisible into two kinds: the typical males among whom homosexual behaviour, including intercourse, is common and \"effeminate sheep\", or \"behavioural transvestites\", which are not known to engage in homosexual behaviour.[40][41]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sexual_behaviour\n \n \n \nI believe the title 'peer-reviewed journal' says it all.\n\n No. It doesn't.\n Thus my question.\n WHY do you insist on \"peer-reviewed journal\"?\n I HAVE DOCUMENTED my claims, unlike you.\n The fact that the documentation came in the form of a news article, as opposed to a researcher devoting a multi-page essay on the subject does not denigrate the fact that MY CLAIM IS DOCUMENTED as true. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Quite frankly, I could turn around and demand YOU document your claim on \"anthropomorphism\" regarding animal homosexuality, but I don't see a point in that cause we can discuss it.\n Obviously, you're trying to tie in an appeal to authority with your argument on absence trend to pretend you have a point, when you don't.\n \n \n \nNews articles on the other hand, can repeat or misinterpret any nonsense stated by anyone who claims to know what they are talking about.\n\n See, maybe you're new to this.\n But when most people talk about news articles CAN misrepresent, the actual LOGICAL approach is to show how, in THIS case on THIS subject, that has actually happened.\n \n Furthermore, being published in a \"peer-reviewed journal\" IS NOT protection against misrepresentation.\n We could go over the life works of a \"Paul Cameron\" who HAS \"published\" his junk before, but it is filled with inaccuracies and blatant misrepresentation.\n \n PUBLISHING is not protection against being wrong.\n \n So my challenge to you is to show HOW these news articles I gave are wrong.\n Otherwise, you've got no real argument... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nCase in point, the introduction of large lizards called Nile monitors into southern Florida. Close to 90% of news articles similar to the ones you posted on this subject quote nonsense from 'experts' which is not even close to the known biology of these animals.\n\n See what you did just there?\n You ACTIVELY REFUTED THE STORY instead of just insisting on a \"peer-reviewed article\".\n You ACTUALLY SHOWED how some other non-topical story was wrong.\n \n Here, you are obviously refusing to do any leg-work to show how these stories are supposedly wrong. Instead, you want others to assume that they are wrong based on a POSSIBLE error...\n \n \n \n If you really need me to explain the value of peer-reviewed journals than I rest my case...\n\n You fail to recognize my argument.\n It's like somebody walking up to you and offering a seller (you) cash for their item.\n The seller turns around and says \"I'm sorry, but I only accept gold. Cash can be faked.\"\n \n Did the seller actually prove the cash involved was fake? No.\n Did he make ANY EFFORT to determine if the cash involved was forged? No.\n \n He is simply refusing to accept a medium of payment that people accept as standard each and every day for insistence on receiving another form of payment which is obviously less available. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n So unless you can point to flaws in these stories, you don't really have an argument other than \"it could be wrong\" while doing absolutely nothing to show HOW or WHERE it could be wrong... :xbanghead\n \n =====================================================\n Edit:\n Matt, I spent all of two minutes trying to find something.\n And I did...\n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15488542?dopt=Citation\n \n You may not like it for some arbitrary reason, but it documents something VERY SPECIFIC against your claim of \"body weight in biology/ecology books and papers\" and \"None of them have said homosexuality is a legitimate phenomenon in nature\"...\n \n Such papers are obviously out there, documenting homosexuality in nature.\n If you want to pursue such an avenue as continuing these pointless demands, I can return the favor.\n Perhaps you can document a peer-reviewed research article claiming that homosexuality in nature is actually \"anthropomorphism\"?",

I think when many Christians say that homosexuality is \"unnatural\", they mean definition 1. \n \n As to God himself not being natural, that depends on what kind of Christian you are talking to. I am a Christian. I and all in my specific sect believe that God follows laws of nature, that if we knew enough science, we would understand how he performs his miracles. Therefore according to me, God is natural, given definitions 2(a and b), 8, 10, and even 7.\n \n I take a rather unorthodox view to gays, however. Christ taught not to judge. He taught to love all others unconditionally. I do not agree with the homosexual lifestyle choice, BUT I feel that it is a greater wrong to restrict free will. I do not believe that my beliefs should be forced on anybody. So do I support gay marriage? I do, with one caveat. I do not believe that gays being allowed to marry should affect my family directly. Currently, gay marriage being legally recognized would mean that my children will be taught IN SCHOOL that it is a perfectly acceptable lifestyle choice. I would feel that just as people should be free to raise their children as republicans, or democrats, as Catholics or Muslims, I should be free to teach my children that it is not right, but not to judge those who choose it. In one state where gay marriage is recognized, one family had social services called on them for asking that their child be given a permitted absence the day that \"family choices\" (i.e., gay family, conventional family) was discussed. As long as provisions can be made that protect the conventional family, I am for gay marriage.",
