   "I believe that a number of issues are to be considered in regard to a pregnant woman's health. \n \n How damaging to her health would continuation of the pregnancy be?\n\n This question is the one that I think we all need to clarify as to what degree of damage would be considered too high. For example, most women who go through pregnancy end up having a changed metabolism that makes it harder to keep off weight gain. That can be considered a health issue, though most of us (who support some level of third trimester abortion restrictions) would not consider that serious enough to allow for third trimester abortions. On the opposite end, if there is a high risk of paralysis for continued pregnancy, then I think that most of us would think that is a perfectly valid reason. The trouble mainly lies in the in-between situations.\n \nWhat sort of family responsibilities does she have? Most women, it seems, have family responsibilities of one sort or another, as opposed to men who tend to let family responsibilities go by the wayside.\n \n Is she the breadwinner of the family? If she's disabled, what will happen to her family?\n \n I hate it when men, I presume that most of the trivializers are men, when men trivialize the issue of a woman's health.\n\n These last ones are not health related issues but other issues that I agree can be quite important. However, most of them can be decided before the third trimester. There are rarely good reasons to have to wait until the third trimester to make those decisions.\n \nAnd we very well know that McCain has little use for women. He is a supreme user of women. He married his first wife for her beauty and discarded her when she lost that beauty. He married his next wife for her beauty and wealth but did not hesitate to call her the C word and denounce her for a trollop for putting on so much makeup. The woman is no longer the youthful beauty she once was, so why shouldn't she use make-up if that pleases her?\n \n McCain has repeatedly demonstrated he hates women:\n\n He is a product of the socially conservative mind-set that he, along with most of the Republican party, represents. This does not necessarily mean that he hates women, but it does mean that he places traditional / religious attitudes above considerations of women's needs, which he largely doesn't care about. He probably values women only if they stay within certain pre-determined social boundaries. He did leave his first wife (who had waited for him through all those years of his captivity in Vietnam only to be discarded by him since she lost appeal due to her age and disability from a car accident). On the plus side, he does accept clear responsibility for that and claims that he was selfish, but I wonder whether, given the same choice but with his current mind, he would not have made the same decision. Also on the plus side, he did choose Sarah Palin as his running mate - something that someone who is purely sexist would not do. So, he simply reflects the socially traditional / religious mindset of the Right. \n \n I certainly disagree with his general stance on abortion, but I did hesitate a bit when he made the comment during the debates because there is room for criticism of the pro-choice position about the health exception when we don't publically try to clarify some of its limits.",

I think not.\n \n I regard McCain's choice of Palin as sexist. An arm candy choice. An anti-woman woman who is anti-choice, is willing to parrot what men tell her to say, a thoroughly sexist choice.\n\n I think his main reasons for choosing Sarah Palin was to appeal to the religious right block that usually form the core of the Republican base but which he had alienated earlier in his career. Because of her \"folksy\" personality, her far-right religious views AND her looks, she does appeal to that base. I work with PhDs, some of whom are conservative Republicans and many of whom think that she would even be capable of being president if it came to that - go figure. Apparently they haven't seen the Katie Courig interview so they might be oblivious to her intellectual limitations. Either way, this is the group of voters that picked George W. Bush as president. I don't think they have a very high criteria for intelligence.\n \n Another reason he might have picked her is that he had made significant efforts to court disgruntled Hillary Clinton supporters. Perhaps he thought that picking a woman as a running mate would automatically pull many of those disgruntledd supporters over to the Republican side. I think he was largely wrong on that point.\n \n As for being controleable, Republicans in general are far more heirarchical and submissive to authority (at least Republican or religious authorities) than Democrats. So, no matter what running mate he chose, they probably would be automatically supportive of everything he said. The Republicans are far more controlled in that respect than Democrats - who are harder to tightly control. So, I wouldn't consider that aspect as purely being due to sexism.",
