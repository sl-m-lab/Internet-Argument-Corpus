   "He didn't. \"Righty\" has to do with political inclinations, not correctness. You should know that already.\n\n \n What the hell do you think I was talking about? \n \n \nDo you have any proof of that?\n\n \n The fact that Republicans keep voting socialists into office yet railing against the 'evils' of socialism. The average Gop is so ignorant of what Conservatism is it's not even funny. You yourself didn't even understand what Communism is when you accused Hillary of being one. The current youth Generation is appalling ignorant. Go to a college Republican meeting. Anyone who understand Conservatism will think they are Liberals. \n \n \nWhat are your sources and how many is \"many\"?\n\n \n Look at the incumbency rate. That should provide all the proof that is necessary. \n \n \nCan you please quantify massive ignorance and tell me why you think that it applies in a greater measure to rightwing politics.\n\n \n Name me the last time we had an actual conservative in the WH or an actual Conservative Congress. Good luck with that. Maybe 50 years ago? MAYBE. \n \n \nWhat you obviously do not understand is that some people evaluate candidates rather than vote for members of any particular party. Can you please explain how you know why people that were pro-Bush are jumping to support McCain solely because he is Republican. Is this just an empty claim or can it be shown true by the presentation of some reliable source.\n\n \n Have you LOOKED at McCain's record? Have you LOOKED at how often he has clashed with Dubya and his party? For all of Ann Coulter's faults, she is correct that McCain is nothing like the rest of his party. The fact that Bushes are jumping for him when he essentially gave Bush the finger so many times is amusing. But that many have to do more with ignorant GOP voters seeing (R) and just voting. I'll agree with you that many people vote on issues, perhaps too many on single issues, but you remember hearing all of those \"i'd rather vote for a dead ____ then a democrat.\" \n \n Plus many XXXXXX in this country can't figure out this is a 1.5 party system. We might as well just merge the parties. The differences between the two can be counted on one hand. \n \n \nI doubt you have any more accurate a crystal ball than the previous poster. You likely have no solid evidence to back up your claim either. If you do, please present it.\n\n \n Can I request you to do the same for your arguments. \n \n hahahahaha. I know you better then that. \n \n \nI believe we have troops in 120 foreign countries today, including all of those in which we've fought wars. There's nothing wrong with leaving troops in different countries. It stimulates their economy and ours, too.\n\n \n How does it stimulate our economy? Or better yet, how does it stimulate our economy that can't be done better? You seem to be saying that it is okay for the US tax payer to fund the growth of other nations through a terribly inefficient model. I smell a liberal.\n \n \nThe war did progress toward an end after the surge. That's what McCain said all along. That's one area where he differed from GWB and wanted to mop up quickly.\n\n \n not directly due to the surge. The stability is because the Mahdi agreed to a cease fire. \n \n \nThe war might have progressed more quickly toward an end had it not been for the sabotage and outright treason by supposed representatives of the people of the United States such as Ted Kennedy, Nancy Pelosi and some other Democrats that oppose Bush simply because he is a Republican.\n\n \n You haven't learned anything about warfare. You CANNOT fight a insurgency in a conventional method. Seriously, do you know what Vietnam was? Until the recent change in command, we were going down the toliet. You might want to pick up \"learning to eat soup with a knife\" before talking about why the invasion wasn't doing so well. \n \n I used to think that only liberals didn't know anything about warfare. Obviously that opinion has changed. Remember that it was the Republicans who tried to restrict the use of troops in Kosovo. Apparently they didn't learn anything about denial in war as well. \n \n \nAll this has little to do with the lack of a viable choice from the Democrats. Obama and Clinton are so nearly alike that they appear to be twins. Either of them can tax us half to death, try to disarm us personally with gun restrictions, disarm us globally by gutting the military and turn us into a collective of public servants.\n\n \n Half to death? Do I need to call Daewoo in here to put you in your place on taxes? The US has one of the lowest rates of taxes in the developed world. Have you SEEN the marginal tax rates in parts of Europe? Oh wait, this is entering economics, something the peanut gallery has little to no knowledge of. Even compared to past historical rates, the US is much lower then much of the 1st world. And if you think that Republicans lowered taxes at all, you're out of your mind. All the GOP does with tax reductions is pass the buck to the states who have to raise taxes due to decrease federal transfer payments. You're STILL IN THE SAME SPOT. Counties all over the US during the 2001 tax cuts jacked up their rates to cover their deficits. The ignorance people have over taxes is just amusing. As for disarming, I'm always amused how crackpots think that restricting 'assault' weapons = taking every firearm you have. Sure the brady act and other such laws did restrict weapon ownage....well not really if you understood the loops and flaws, but they hardly equated to complete disarment. And what is more amusing is that those who make that claim always do so for the reason that firearms protect us from the government. Explain to me how your rifle is going to stop a tank or an apache. It's not. Stop pretending. If you want good government, ensure you elect decent people. Firearms are not the answer. And as for the military, it was Reagan who started the cuts, Bush who cut more and Clinton who cut more. I see TWO republicans there. How many do you see? Or are you going to, as virtually every Republican who I mention that to, ignore that? \n \n And we should be cutting the military. Ask Steeeve and Daewoo for why it is going to be a huge financial problem. Plus you don't need a massive military to fight the future wars. Learn what the British did in the Malayan Emergency. Conventional wars are going to be the rarity in the future. The last major conventional conflict was DS. Between that and Korea, there have been at least 24 insurgency conflicts. Look at history for a change jim. \n \n \nSince their party icon is an XXX, I really thought it would be quite becoming and complimentary to both of them to depict them as a matched pair of horse's asses.\n \n I plan to vote Libertarian.\n\n \n Sure you will.",

   "Dude, what are you smoking? When has McCain done anything but CONDEMN this torture (Guantanamo torture, etc.)\n\n He talks a good game, but he includes an asterisk.. a BIG asterisk.\n \n link\n \n Here's a summary:\n \"Torture is bad, mmkay? Torture is really bad, and we shouldn't do it.\n \"It is very disturbing that we even have to address this issue, because torture is bad. It is inhuman, and it doesn't work anyway.\n \"We should have laws on the books that prohibit this kind of treatment of prisoners. There is no reason we'd have to torture anybody.\n \n \"Oh, but if we think someone has some major information, then, uh, yeah, we can beat the hell out of him if we think it will save American lives.\n \"Also, that's why we can't put clear language in an anti-torture bill, even though I keep saying that we should. That'd be tying our hands. But we can't put in exceptions to allow for these justifiable inhuman beatings because then we'd look bad.*\n \n \"But just remember, torture is bad.\"\n \n *: Text in question, including the entire paragraphs:\n Those who argue the necessity of some abuses raise an important dilemma as their most compelling rationale: the ticking-time-bomb scenario. What do we do if we capture a terrorist who we have sound reasons to believe possesses specific knowledge of an imminent terrorist attack?\n \n In such an urgent and rare instance, an interrogator might well try extreme measures to extract information that could save lives. Should he do so, and thereby save an American city or prevent another 9/11, authorities and the public would surely take this into account when judging his actions and recognize the extremely dire situation which he confronted. But I don't believe this scenario requires us to write into law an exception to our treaty and moral obligations that would permit cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment. To carve out legal exemptions to this basic principle of human rights risks opening the door to abuse as a matter of course, rather than a standard violated truly in extremis. It is far better to embrace a standard that might be violated in extraordinary circumstances than to lower our standards to accommodate a remote contingency, confusing personnel in the field and sending precisely the wrong message abroad about America's purposes and practices.\n",

That's one area where he differed from GWB and wanted to mop up quickly.\n \n The war might have progressed more quickly toward an end had it not been for the sabotage and outright treason by supposed representatives of the people of the United States such as Ted Kennedy, Nancy Pelosi and some other Democrats that oppose Bush simply because he is a Republican.\n\n \n This is HIGHLY debatable. We put 50,000 more troops on the ground, out in the streets, and violence dropped. That was NOT the measure of \"sucess\". The surge was supposed to lead to a short term lull in violence which was to give the Iraqi government a chance to come together and take control and make some political progress...hopefully enough that the insurgents would lose their taste for violence. \n \n Even the architects of the surge agreed that it was NOT a long term solution, because the insurgents would adapt. They also agreed that it was king of an \"all or nothing\" deal because if the Iraqis did not make the progress they needed to we would end up with a stronger, more resourceful insurgency with better hardened supply lines. \n \n Bad news...the Iraqis pretty much made no political progress, the insurgents are getting restless, and the recent surges in violence have shown that the insurgents are certainly in better shape and able to plan more effectively.\n \n I do not see how we can possibly blame Pelosi or Kennedy for this. They are not members of the Iraqi government. The blame for this one, like the rest of the Iraq war, lies squarely on Bush and his cronies. They could have listened when people told them from day one that their plan for Iraq was unworkable. Right now the biggest impediment to sucess when it comes to passage of new laws in Iraq is the fact that Bush and Cheney continually insist that the oil bill that Cheney engineered (literally) that gives western oil companies majority control of Iraqs oil be at the top of the agenda always. There is MASSIVE opposition in Iraq to that bill and as long as they have to start every legislative session with it, there is never going to be any progress there. \n \n \nAll this has little to do with the lack of a viable choice from the Democrats. Obama and Clinton are so nearly alike that they appear to be twins. Either of them can tax us half to death, try to disarm us personally with gun restrictions, disarm us globally by gutting the military and turn us into a collective of public servants.\n\n \n Obama and clinton are NOTHING alike. Obamas economic plan is almost as bad as McCains. There is no reality there AT ALL. Hillary actually HAS such a plan. Under the McCain plan, he is going ot extens 1.4 trillion in tax cuts, pay for it by cutting $200 billion in spending, and the government will literally be insolvent by the middle of 2010. If we want to still HAVE a nation in 2011, we are going to HAVE TO raise taxes.\n \n On the second issue I agree and that is my biggest sticking point with hillary. I am hoping that the the supreme courts decision in the Heller case will help with that. \n \n Gutting the military is going to happen no matter who is in charge. We simply cannot afford to keep up our senselessly high level of military spending. The money just is not there. \n \n \nSince their party icon is an XXX, I really thought it would be quite becoming and complimentary to both of them to depict them as a matched pair of horse's asses.\n\n \n I thought it was funny.
