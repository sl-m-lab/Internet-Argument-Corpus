   "THE YANKEE YEARS by JOE TORRE & TOM VERDUCCI\n \n Tom Verducci chronicles the 12 years in which Joe Torre managed the New York Yankees 1996-2007. \n \n Torre was actually owner George Steinbrenner's fourth choice as the Yankees' manager for 96. Torre had a losing record as a manager up to that point, but he was a man who believed in honesty and trust. He was a calming influence. He also had a way with the media. Torre was elated to have the job. \n \n The Yankees' starting rotation for 96 included David Cone, Jimmy Key and a young Andy Pettitte. Tino Martinez was on first. Wade Boggs was on third. Rookie Derek Jeter was at shortstop. Bernie Williams was in center field. Paul O'Neill was in right. \n \n The Yankees faced the formidable Atlanta Braves in the 96 World Series. It was catcher Jim Leyritz who turned the Series around with a three-run home run in Game 4. Under Joe Torre, the Yankees became World Champions for the first time in 18 years. \n \n Under Torre, the New York Yankees won 4 out of 5 World Series. They reached the Series 6 times in 8 years. They got to the postseason 12 years in a row. Torre managed the greatest dynasty in modern baseball. \n \n Verducci says the success 1996-2000 was based more on the character of the players than on their talent. They played as a team. Winning was more important to them than individual statistics. \n \n Verducci calls the 1998 Yankees the \"pinnacle of the dynasty.\" He goes into detail about the players and what they meant to that special team. He praises the leadership of Cone, the ferosity of O'Neill and the humility of Jeter. That team won a total of 125 games, more than any other team in baseball history. They had a \"desperation to win.\" The 98 Yankees swept the San Diego Padres in the World Series with unlikely Scott Brosius as the Series MVP. \n \n 1999 saw fan favorite David Wells traded for Roger Clemens. Clemens got off to a shaky start with the Yankees but came on strong with the help of steroids administered by strength coach Brian McNamee. It is regrettable that Clemens' use of steroids and his lingering denial has jeopardized his legacy. This was the infamous Steroids Era. Players like Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds broke records which had stood for decades. Fans loved it, and baseball looked the other way because of the money. But as the abusers morphed into grotesque giants, it became evident that their prowess was the result of performance-enhancing drugs. Some admitted it. Others continued the lie. \n \n The Yankees went on to win the Fall Classic in both 1999 and 2000. In 2000, they lost 15 of their last 18 games but hung on to win the American League East. Verducci milks the ongoing clash between Roger Clemens and Mets catcher Mike Piazza. \"The Yankee Years\" reads like a novel. \n \n Steinbrenner is portrayed as a demanding, unforgiving master. It adds drama to the book even while there is some truth in it. Steinbrenner for some reason never fully appreciated Andy Pettitte even though Pettitte was a big game pitcher and an integral part of the dynasty. \n \n Verducci dwells on the ill-fated 7th game of the 2001 Series. Mariano Rivera blew the save in the 9th inning. Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling posted two wins apiece for the Diamondbacks. Paul O'Neill had already announced his retirement. An era had ended. \n \n After Alex Rodriguez, or A-Rod, came in 2004, the Yankees were a different team. Players resented A-Rod and his salary. He was at various times known as A-Fraud, Stray-Rod and A-Roid. He finally admitted using steroids after having denied it. Why did he admit it? Because the truth leaked out. He got caught. \n \n Players came and went during the Bush years. The Yankees continued to make the playoffs only to fold their tent and go quietly. \n \n The last part of \"The Yankee Years\" shows Joe Torre drifting away from George Steinbrenner and General Manager Brian Cashman. Steinbrenner was aging, and his sons Hank and Hal were assuming responsibility for daily operations. \n \n Torre's 12 years at the helm were filled with controversy. I try to avoid the squabbling and report on the greatness of the New York Yankees, the baseball franchise which has won the World Series 26 times. \n \n Mike Mussina is a postscript to Torre's reign. Mussina had been dubbed \"Mr. Almost.\" He was almost a 20-game winner. He almost pitched a no-hitter. He almost got a World Series ring. He almost won a Cy Young. In the last game of his career, Mussina erased one of those \"almosts.\" He won a 20th game, giving him a total of 270 career victories. It now looks like Mussina will make baseball's Hall of Fame.",
