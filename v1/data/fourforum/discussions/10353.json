This is true. Some martyrs arriving in paradise may regard a bunch of grapes as a letdown. \"The scholar, who pioneered this path breaking research, using the pseudonym Christoph Luxenberg for security reasons, noted in an e-mail interview that grapes made more sense in context because the Koran compares them to crystal and pearls, and because contemporary accounts have paradise abounding with fruit, especially white grapes.\" \n \n How could anyone think that if there was a god, he/she/it would give sex (72 virgins!!!!!) as a reward?!?! However, if in fact there are 72 virgins waiting, paradise is nothing but a sex orgy! \n \n And, what about the female martyrs? (Think god is a Male Chauvinist Pig?) emoticon_angry ..........If they are NOT lesbians, they are in for a very big let down. Unless, of course, there are 72 grapes waiting for them!!!\n \n To be honest with you... I was about to convert until I read the deal with the grapes! In retrospect, at my age, one virgin would have killed me off..let alone 72 of them!!!! \n\n \n For many people grapes (fermented) might be a better alternative:) \n \n However, whilst I have heard of dying with a smile on your face on earth, what would be the equivalent in paradise ?emoticon_xlove",

   "I. I'm a Roman Catholic\n II. True religion - no.\n \n 1. Religion is established by prophets, not deities necessarily. Prophets function only as \"advocates\" of deities. Different cultures indeed have different \"prophets,\" all preaching different teachings at different places. (Relativism)\n \n 2. Try finding two religions which have contradictory teachings. A religion is just as good as the sum of its teachings. If one of its teachings is A and another is not-A (or negation of A) then one must be necessarily true and one false. But there will be a false religion, which is what we wanted to show. Therefore we either need to accept that some religions are true, and some false. So there's a false one (op.I), or we would need to accept that religion is not anymore a matter of truth (op.II)\n \n 3. As for mine, I admit that a religion is just as good as its history and its incosistencies. The Inquisition, you'd say? And creationism vs evolution. (As an alternative to #2, try piting religion with science.) So I am at risk of running to op.I. But why would I be there (as a sensible person) if I believe it to be false? Thus we get op.II, (relativism). Religion, thus, is not anmore a matter of mathematical truth, but rather a leap of faith\n \n \"TO stand on one leg and prove God's existence and to kneel down on one's knees and thank Him are different\" \n -Kierkegaard",

For instance, if a hat has 'made in China' on it its probably from China.\n \n \n The reality is though, that most all of the raw materials that go into the products that are made in China came from somewhere else. So what appears to have come from China was in fact only manufactured there. It didn't really come from there.\n \n \nLook at humans. We were equiped by nature to live within nature. We have the desires and drive of an Earthly being, we reflect the cauldron of survival of the fittest in which we were fordged. If we were created by God, why are we so fine tuned toward nature.\n\n \n With all due respect, this is foolishness that makes no sense at all in reality. Every animal on Earth no matter how small or weak from our perspective is equipped to somehow survive and flourish in the harshness of the ecosystem that is its natural habitat. From the animals that survive, and even flourish in Antarctica, to the creatures that flourish under the sands of the hottest deserts on Earth, to the fish that survive the darkness, cold, the pressure and conditions of the deepest Oceans on Earth. Animals are designed to survive the natural conditions of Nature rather than to have learned to artificially create habitats to make the harshness of the Natural World to serve them AS ONLY HUMANITY HAS DONE.\n \n We don't live within the natural limitations of our human condition at all. We can't fly naturally yet we have learned to fly as birds never even imagined it possible. We have no gills yet we have conquered the depths of the Oceans by being able to survive and work under them for literally months on end without surfacing in machines called submarines. We have attained speeds that the fastest animals on Earth could not even imagine. \n \n So ask yourself why, if all animals went through the same evolutionary processes, and all animals had the same opportunities, and if all animals struggled against the same environmental and social type challenges having existed in a World of hunters vs the hunted, Carnivore vs Herbivores, with omnivores in the mix too; why did only Man attain higher reasoning, creativity, complex communication and the need to recreate the Earth in our image when after all of this time from the so called evolutionary perspective, animals are still just animals? \n \n \nIf we didn't go through a process of natural selection, why does our very DNA read as if we have.\n \n \n It's all a matter of interpretation. I submit to you that our DNA makes no such conclusions at all. If it did, what happened to our fur? Why, if we originally had fur to protect us from the elements did we start wearing clothes which nullified our need for clothing causing us to evolve from fur covered bodies to just hair? By all evolutionary standards and even common sense, isn't that putting the cart before the horse? Are evolutionists saying that even though Java or Peking Man had fur that they wore animal skins anyway in order to de-evolve the fur they had? Is that rational or reasonable to you? Does it pass the smell test? Yet the question isn't even considered in the religious doctrine of evolution.\n \n \nFollowing that if there was a God, Like your Religious God why would he go to the trouble of evolution and nature to get to us? I thought he did it all in 6 days etc.. It is silly and makes no sense. If I get made about it it is because of the Wasted time, the blood and the suffering caused by these silly superstitions. Without the con job by Christianity, we'd have built upon the Greek logic and Roman engineering. Look how far we've come in the last 100 years, is it any coincidence that the church's stranglehold has been failing for about that same amount of time.\n\n \n Well there you go then. You have been effectively brainwashed to accept only the secular humanist perspective of our origins. You are no longer a free agent but have submitted to the pseudo scientific authority that now tells you what you must believe about how you got here. And in this paragraph you make the largest contradiction in this whole post. You again attack Christianity as holding humanity back as if it is anti-human progress, yet look at the leadership position in the scientific leaps forward that the United States of America has played in that same last 100 years. Haven't we led the way in every aspect of scientific progress? This predominantly Christian nation that offered freedom for all people to embrace the religion of their choice? \n \n So forgive me for disagreeing with your unfair and harsh judgment of what Christianity really has represented to the human condition. I suggest to you that if not for the powerful spiritual impact Jesus Christ had on the salvation of the human soul 2000 years ago, that this Planet would be so steeped in spiritual darkness today so as not be worth living in at all. \n \n And when you consider evolution and questions it can't answer to your satisfaction pop into your mind, instead of just saying, Oh well; demand an answer, because if it is true, then no question should be off limits.",

   "... Every animal on Earth no matter how small or weak from our perspective is equipped to somehow survive and flourish in the harshness of the ecosystem that is its natural habitat. From the animals that survive, and even flourish in Antarctica, to the creatures that flourish under the sands of the hottest deserts on Earth, to the fish that survive the darkness, cold, the pressure and conditions of the deepest Oceans on Earth. Animals are designed to survive the natural conditions of Nature rather than to have learned to artificially create habitats to make the harshness of the Natural World to serve them AS ONLY HUMANITY HAS DONE.\n\n Beavers build dams from logs and trees. Humans build houses from bricks and mortar. Why do beavers need dams when they have insulated fur coats? Aren't we all just adapting to our environment as best we can?\n \n If humans are natural animals, everything we do is therefore natural. As such we don't artificially create habitats for ourselves (only for the husbandry of other species).\n \n \nWe don't live within the natural limitations of our human condition at all.\n\n What are these natural limitations?\n \n \nWe can't fly naturally yet we have learned to fly as birds never even imagined it possible. We have no gills yet we have conquered the depths of the Oceans by being able to survive and work under them for literally months on end without surfacing in machines called submarines. We have attained speeds that the fastest animals on Earth could not even imagine. \n\n Meaningless. The natural human animal has learned to shape his environment. The end game is survival.\n \n \nSo ask yourself why, if all animals went through the same evolutionary processes, and all animals had the same opportunities, \n\n Did they?\n \n \n\n ...why did only Man attain higher reasoning, creativity, complex communication ...\n\n Why not? The qualities you describe are also relative.\n \n \n \n \n...and the need to recreate the Earth in our image when after all of this time from the so called evolutionary perspective, animals are still just animals? \n\n How do you want to define 'animal'? We are still just animals from a biological perspective. You make an interesting comment about man needing to recreate the earth in his image: in fact it's the theist that creates his own god in man's image. But I suppose that will be OK?\n \n \n \n \nIt's all a matter of interpretation. I submit to you that our DNA makes no such conclusions at all. If it did, what happened to our fur?

   "You already know the answer to this question according to Genesis snakespit, yet you ask anyway. But you don't really care what I respond with as you will only mock it.\n\n I do? Then why did I ask the question? Are you speaking of the tree? For if you are, it brings more to mind. Disobedience. Again, an all powerful, all knowing god would already know the outcome of the tree. If god were truly all knowing, he would have known that we would eat of the tree that he told us not to. So by placing the tree, god was in essence setting a trap for us. In order for his creation to be disobedient, god would have had to make that a possibility. So knowing that we would do something god told us not to do, he set us up, and now we know pain and \"sin\" because of it. God is a sadist. \n \n \nWhat you fail to realize though is that it was our disobedience that caused those character traits that would be strengths in a perfect World, to be corrupted into what they are within the human soul since our fall from grace. God made us perfectly as He is perfect, but disobedience killed us spiritually and separated us from Him. But you blame Him for the suffering humanity has inflicted upon itself because of our own spiritual depravity.\n\n So again, you are saying that god set us up? You must be...since in order for us to be disobedient, god would have had to first embue us with that trait. And, since god already knew that we would be disobedient and still let us go forward, he is to blame. You say that god made us perfectly, but would we be disobedient if we were perfect? If we were perfect, I doubt you would be using terms like: disobedient, killed us spiritually, separated us from him, suffering inflicted, spiritual depravity. You say god made us perfectly as he is perfect..well, apparently not. \n \n [/QUOTE]That is what is so incredibly sad about the Natural Man snakespit.

I have read the bible, and have a fairly good grasp on what it has to say, as do you. Difference is, you believe it...I don't. I find so many flaws in mans version of god, especially the christian version introduced to us in Genesis, that I find it almost laughable. Had we been created perfectly by a perfect god, there would be nothing to save us from in the first place. \n \n And please do not misunderstand my position. I do not confirm or deny the existence of god. I do not count myself arrogant enough to actually think that I could understand \"god\" by reading a book written by humans with so many holes and flaws. My post is not meant to \"damn\" god, you, or even your religion. It is simply me stating that what you and your book say make no sense to me. Second, I feel no need to be saved by anybody. I have not asked to be saved, and do not feel that there is anything I need to be saved from. It is your fundamental belief in YOUR god that makes you feel that you need to be saved.

   "Snake, when you were asking about 'god or jeebus' according to the whole 'trinity' god actually is all three (father, son, holey ghost) etc...\n \n I'm right there with you on most of your last post except on one point... namely about damning god. Frankly, my view used to be that IF there is a God he's more of an experimenter or 'clock maker' that if he did create life its more like to see what would happen and the entire Earth is like one of his cable channels out of a nearly infinite TV set. The more I learn about Cosmology and Physics the more I believe that there isn't even a sort of power that gave it the push. In fact S. Hawking and his assoc. have shown that there was only a 95% chance that our universe could be created:\n \n [I]\"But the theist should be bothered. The Hartle-Hawking wave function psi[hij, phi] provides a high probability that is less than one (we will call it .95) that a universe shall begin to exist with a three dimensional space that has a certain matter field phi and metric hij. If God wills that a Hartle-Hawking universe shall begin to exist, the probability of its beginning to exist is not 95% but 100%, since God's willing is omnipotent. But it cannot be true both that the Hartle-Hawking law obtains, such that the probability that a Hartle-Hawking universe shall begin to exist is 95%, and that God wills that a Hartle-Hawking universe shall begin to exist, such that the probability that a Hartle-Hawking universe shall begin to exist is 100%. As I argued in (1994), the unconditional probability derived from quantum cosmology makes this theory logically incompatible with theism. Since quantum cosmology is confirmed by the observational evidence, this incompatibility should be troubling to anybody who believes theism is a rationally acceptable world-view.\"[/\n \n NOW LET ME SAY ONE OTHER THING.

   "Here is your original post claiming that some imaginary empirical scientific evidence makes it hard to believe in God.\n \n \n But empirical scientific evidence is making it harder and harder to believe in 'God'. I used to think that there was at least a chance of a sort of 'clockmaker' type god (certainly, not a 'watching you in the bathroom god) but the more I study, the less likely that seems....\n\n \n I responded here that only a fool would try to prove that a spiritual Creator God exists using the scientific method, which I most assuredly stand by.\n \n \nOnly a fool who is lacking all insight and spiritual discernment would think that the God of all Creation could be proven in a lab or some petrie dish through some human designed science experiment. You must get spiritual and seek God directly if you hope to ever find Him CUNxTIME. To actually give up on Him existing is to give up on yourself.\n\n \n \n\"Only A fool....\"\n \n Angel, I find that an interesting choice of words from someone who believes that the same creature who'd torture his most devout servant over a BET with the 'devil' created everything. I find it a bit foolish to think that there's something with the power to end child rape and choses not to, I find it a bit foolish to drink the blood of god once a week but who knows, maybe you are right emoticon_wow\n\n \n And you respond here by completely abandoning the concept of finding evidence for God and revert to attacking HIM based on your complete lack of spiritual understanding. You completely pervert what and who He is rather than stay with the original premise of how you can prove He exists. Which is typical of those who find it more important to support their perspective rather than actually discover the truth which forces us to submit to the authority of a perfect and eternal God. \n \n So the point is that when you're ready to actually investigate how YOU can prove God is real, and a personal God who is more than just a concept, you will also learn that He loves you as an individual and not just as concept either. But as long as you cherry pick the bible looking for any random part that on its face seems wrong from your very finite, and very limited perspective, then you will remain ignorant of what the actual truth really is.",

The reason for it to exist is that people are scared to die and want to think that something more exists afterward and then also as a tool of control. Now if you take everything we've learned about the Universe through Physics and Cosmology, it is easy to see that he's nowhere to be found. I mean, in a universe with black holes there can't be God.\n \n Here's one relevant passage from Quinten Smith\n \n 3. If quantum cosmology gives us unconditional probabilities for the universe's beginning to exist, why should that bother the theist, apart from Craig's concern about cosmology trespassing on theological territory? It does not bother Plantinga (1996); and Markosian (1995), although an atheist, thinks the theist should not be bothered.\n \n But the theist should be bothered. The Hartle-Hawking wave function psi[hij, phi] provides a high probability that is less than one (we will call it .95) that a universe shall begin to exist with a three dimensional space that has a certain matter field phi and metric hij. If God wills that a Hartle-Hawking universe shall begin to exist, the probability of its beginning to exist is not 95% but 100%, since God's willing is omnipotent. But it cannot be true both that the Hartle-Hawking law obtains, such that the probability that a Hartle-Hawking universe shall begin to exist is 95%, and that God wills that a Hartle-Hawking universe shall begin to exist, such that the probability that a Hartle-Hawking universe shall begin to exist is 100%. As I argued in (1994), the unconditional probability derived from quantum cosmology makes this theory logically incompatible with theism. Since quantum cosmology is confirmed by the observational evidence, this incompatibility should be troubling to anybody who believes theism is a rationally acceptable world-view.\n \n Ned Markosian thinks any incompatibility between the Hartle-Hawking wave function and theism can be resolved by matching up the probability values, so that both are 95%. He described an allegedly possible scenario where the unconditional probability of a Hartle-Hawking universe beginning to exist is 95% and yet that God creates this universe. Markosian asks us to suppose there are 20 possible universes that are tied for best in an intrinsic value-ranking and that 19 of them are Hartle-Hawking-type universes. According to Markosian, since God is omnipotent, God could see to it that, for each of these universes, there is a 5% chance that he will create (on a whimsy) that universe. It follows that there is a 95% probability that a Hartle-Hawking universe will be created by God. As it happens (Markosian's scenario continues), God does will that a Hartle-Hawking universe exist. Markosian thinks this scenario makes theism consistent with Hartle's and Hawking's cosmology.\n \n But it does not, for the wave function of the universe implies that the natural-mathematical properties of the relevant possible universes make it 95% probable that a Hartle-Hawking universe begins to exist uncaused. This probability statement is not consistent with the theistic assertion that there is 0% probability that a Hartle-Hawking universe begins to exist uncaused.\n \n Furthermore, Markosian's scenario implies the 95% probability of a Hartle-Hawking universe obtains only because it is derived from supernatural considerations. According to theism, if a universe is to have any probability of existing, this probability is dependent upon God's beliefs, desires and creative acts. But the Hartle-Hawking probability is not dependent on any supernatural considerations; Hartle and Hawking do not sum over anything supernatural in their path integral derivation of the probability amplitude.\n \n Moreover, even apart from these problems, the counter-argument Markosian presents involves mistaking a conditional probability for an unconditional probability. The Hartle-Hawking probability is 'unconditional' in the sense that it is not conditional upon any concrete event or object that exists. But the 95% 'unconditional probability' that Markosian purports to derive in his theistic scenario is not in fact unconditional. First, it is conditional upon God having decided to create something rather than not create anything. Second, it is conditional upon God deciding to create a universe, rather than just disembodied spirits. Third, it is conditional upon God deciding to create one of the 20 universes that are tied in value-ranking (19 being Hartle-Hawking universes and one not of this type). So there is no sense in which Markosian has given us what he purports to have given us: an unconditional probability of a Hartle-Hawking universe beginning to exist.\n \n In addition, Markosian's theistic scenario is internally inconsistent. He supposes that God leaves it to a 'whimsy' as to which of the 20 universes he will eventually create, thereby making it 95% probable that the universe he will whimsically create is a Hartle-Hawking universe. Markosian supposes there is time before creation, with God first deciding that he will whimsically create one of the twenty universes, and later creating one of them. But God has foreknowledge of what he shall do, and he foreknows which universe he will create. Therefore, there is never a time at which a Hartle-Hawking universe has a 95% probability of existing; God always knows or foreknows that the universe he creates is a Hartle-Hawking universe, and thus there is always a 100% probability that a universe of this type will exist. So the probability values do not even match up.\n \n As if this were not enough, Markosian is supposing there is time before the universe. But the Hartle-Hawking wave function gives us a probability of 95% that time begins to exist. Time begins to exist with the universe, as the temporal dimension of spacetime. The wave function of the universe is an abstract objection that timelessly exists and it timelessly entails a 95% metric hij in the probability amplitude psi[hij, phi]. But Markosian's scenario that God creates a matter field phi that comes into existence at a certain time in a pre-existent time. Discussing this cosmological scenario in effect amounts to changing the subject; we are no longer talking about the Hartle-Hawking theory that matter and spacetime begin to exist.\n \n I conclude that Markovian's arguments fail to justify the belief that the Hartle-Hawking wave function of the universe is logically consistent with theism. But there is another argument by Alvin Plantinga that these two theories are consistent.",

Talk about hubris, arrogance, self delusions and placing your faith in the creature rather than the Creator. Good luck with that losers gambit.\n Age of Universe Revised, Again \n By Robert Roy Britt\n Senior Science Writer\n posted: 11:22 am ET\n 03 January 2003\n \n We speculated just last week in our Top 10 Space Mysteries [See #8] that the ongoing effort to figure out how hold the universe is would yield at least one more estimate during 2003.\n \n We had no idea it would come so soon.\n \n In a study published today in the journal Science, a team of researchers says the universe is between 11.2 billion and 20 billion years old.\n \n Most estimates in recent years have ranged between 10 billion and 15 billion years. Last year, data supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope led to an apparently refined estimate of 13 billion to 14 billion years.\n \n The new calculations, by Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Reserve University and Brian Chaboyer at Dartmouth College, involved new information about old star clusters in our galaxy and a better understanding of how stars evolve. It was based on when stars are thought to end the main sequence of their lives, a point at which they've used up the hydrogen that fuels thermonuclear fusion and therefore begin to dim.\n \n The new appraisal comes with a 95 percent level of confidence, which means the door is still open for further revision and that last year's tighter Hubble estimate might prove on track.\n \n The new estimates were made as part of a larger effort to understand how the universe is structured, and they agree with an increasingly solid case suggesting that 95 percent of the universe is controlled by so-called dark energy. Scientists don't know what this mysterious force is, or how it works, but they see evidence of it in the fact that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate.\n \n Dark energy is sometimes described as applying a negative pressure to the universe. While gravity holds individual galaxies together, dark energy works to pull galaxies from each other at faster and faster rates.\n http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/age_universe_030103.html\n \n Here's another link that locks it in at 12 Billion years old. Until you read the article of course. And then he explains the unknowns that mean he actually has no clue at all. But hey, it's a paper and it implies he actually knows something.\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/352563.stm\n \n So like I said originally, attacking the bible and making wildly unsubstantiated claims isn't proof of anything.",

I found this little gem which of course is nothing more than a figment of your puny imagination. And is in no way substantiated with any credible links once again, I might add. Well if what you say is true, then why is the gap for the age of the Universe so incredibly wide; by billions of years? And my source is space.com which took it from the Journal Science.\n \n Note the bolded and take your pick as to the actual age of the Universe. So in what fantasy did you come up with this preposterous claim, and I quote: We can determine the history of the Universe down to one hundred thousand million billion billion billionth of a second from the beginning. And you call me, believing in a living and intelligent God who created such an organized Cosmos, stupid? Talk about hubris, arrogance, self delusions and placing your faith in the creature rather than the Creator. Good luck with that losers gambit.\n Age of Universe Revised, Again \n By Robert Roy Britt\n Senior Science Writer\n posted: 11:22 am ET\n 03 January 2003\n \n We speculated just last week in our Top 10 Space Mysteries [See #8] that the ongoing effort to figure out how hold the universe is would yield at least one more estimate during 2003.\n \n We had no idea it would come so soon.\n \n In a study published today in the journal Science, a team of researchers says the universe is between 11.2 billion and 20 billion years old.\n \n Most estimates in recent years have ranged between 10 billion and 15 billion years. Last year, data supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope led to an apparently refined estimate of 13 billion to 14 billion years.\n \n The new calculations, by Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Reserve University and Brian Chaboyer at Dartmouth College, involved new information about old star clusters in our galaxy and a better understanding of how stars evolve. It was based on when stars are thought to end the main sequence of their lives, a point at which they've used up the hydrogen that fuels thermonuclear fusion and therefore begin to dim.\n \n The new appraisal comes with a 95 percent level of confidence, which means the door is still open for further revision and that last year's tighter Hubble estimate might prove on track.\n \n The new estimates were made as part of a larger effort to understand how the universe is structured, and they agree with an increasingly solid case suggesting that 95 percent of the universe is controlled by so-called dark energy. Scientists don't know what this mysterious force is, or how it works, but they see evidence of it in the fact that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate.\n \n Dark energy is sometimes described as applying a negative pressure to the universe. While gravity holds individual galaxies together, dark energy works to pull galaxies from each other at faster and faster rates.\n http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/age_universe_030103.html\n \n Here's another link that locks it in at 12 Billion years old. Until you read the article of course. And then he explains the unknowns that mean he actually has no clue at all. But hey, it's a paper and it implies he actually knows something.\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/352563.stm\n \n So like I said originally, attacking the bible and making wildly unsubstantiated claims isn't proof of anything.\n",

Have you investigated the odds of just the human eye evolving as it did accidentally, or according to the fictional laws of Random Mutation? And then extend that equation to the eye of the bee, the bat, the undersea creatures and every other type of vision that every unique creature has? \n \n But back to the Bee. How long has the Bee existed? Did it also evolve? If so, when did it evolve the ability to see in the ultra violet spectrum? Wouldn't that ability have had to be present at the very inception of its existence in order for the bee to have survived to evolve? But you never thought of that huh? There are a lot of questions you so called intellectual evolutionists don't have the brains to ask. Or else you would see the obvious inconsistencies in what you have been spoon fed and are to ignorant to even question. \n \n \n The fact that there is evidence of all kinds of plants and animals (us included) evolving to fit within nature.\n\n \n Isn't it fascinating that the exact animals that need the plants to sustain their lives allegedly evolved millions of years after the plants spontaneously evolved into being. Do the math on the odds of that happening randomly, by accident and all the pieces fitting together so perfectly that life on Earth sustains itself like clockwork.\n \n \nThe effect of the bending of spacetime due to gravity.\n\n \n And why must this be an act of nature? You keep insisting this yet you provide no absolute evidence at all. And with everything you add, you show that you haven't even considered what you believe very much at all in an objective manner. All you do is take scientific principles and assume they must have come about like you believe all life did, by random mutation, because that is what you have been told and like any good robot, you blindly accept the programming. \n \n \nThe universal speed limit of 180,000m/s. ALL of Everything screams out for the answers of how we got here being the tearing of 10d space into 4d spacetime and 6d rolled up into PlanK space.\n\n \n AGAIN, prove it! prove any of this is actually empirically true in any way? Prove that in 100 years all of what you claim to be true so dogmatically wont completely be rediscovered and reinterpreted 10 times over? With all new conclusions as a result? That is why they call these beliefs theories, because none of them are proven facts. So why do you repeat them as if they are facts?

Because everything except faith cryies out against it!\n\n \n You want empirical evidence of God? I submit your post as evidence. Everything you claim came about naturally, by accident, I claim came by way of Intelligent Design by an involved and Intelligent God. Now prove me wrong! In fact, if you study the odds of all of the varieties of life, along with the varieties of required life sustaining food sources, along with the proper environments, as the chain of life is not only self sustaining, but is interdependent upon each other self replicating in order to continue to survive as a complete ecosystem, then the odds that it required intelligence to create such a system leans overwhelmingly in my favor and leaves you to standing on a hill screaming and insisting that you are right, just exactly as you have done here while providing absolutely no evidence of anything. But you sure have shown that your brain has been effectively washed though.\n \n And it's obvious you're going to just ignore a prophecy that was written 800 years before Christ walked the Earth.

And you claim not to have attacked Israel's history? What do you think the entire Old Testament is that you attacked in the post above? It is a record of how God dealt with the children of Abraham as He led them to the Promised Land and ultimately fulfilled His 300+ OT Prophecies regarding the coming of Messiah who would die for the sins of Humanity. Have you ever read an Old Testament Prophecy that foretold the coming of Jesus Christ? Would you like to read one that even you can't deny is a perfect description of Him and only Him? Check this out and then tell me which of us is believing the lies of men, and which is trusting a God who sees through all of Time and Space because He created it after all. This is the Prophet Isaiah who lived approximately 800 years before Jesus walked the Earth. And that is historically documented. \n \n Isa 52:13 See, my servant will prosper; he will be highly exalted.\n Isa 52:14 Many were amazed when they saw him[fn3]-beaten and bloodied, so disfigured one would scarcely know he was a person.\n Isa 52:15 And he will again startle[fn4] many nations. Kings will stand speechless in his presence. For they will see what they had not previously been told about; they will understand what they had not heard about.\n Isa 53:1 Who has believed our message? To whom will the Lord reveal his saving power?\n Isa 53:2 My servant grew up in the Lord's presence like a tender green shoot, sprouting from a root in dry and sterile ground. There was nothing beautiful or majestic about his appearance, nothing to attract us to him.\n Isa 53:3 He was despised and rejected-a man of sorrows, acquainted with bitterest grief. We turned our backs on him and looked the other way when he went by. He was despised, and we did not care.\n Isa 53:4 Yet it was our weaknesses he carried; it was our sorrows[fn1] that weighed him down. And we thought his troubles were a punishment from God for his own sins!\n Isa 53:5 But he was wounded and crushed for our sins. He was beaten that we might have peace. He was whipped, and we were healed!\n Isa 53:6 All of us have strayed away like sheep. We have left God's paths to follow our own. Yet the Lord laid on him the guilt and sins of us all.\n Isa 53:7 He was oppressed and treated harshly, yet he never said a word. He was led as a lamb to the slaughter. And as a sheep is silent before the shearers, he did not open his mouth.\n Isa 53:8 From prison and trial they led him away to his death. But who among the people realized that he was dying for their sins-that he was suffering their punishment?\n Isa 53:9 He had done no wrong, and he never deceived anyone. But he was buried like a criminal; he was put in a rich man's grave.\n Isa 53:10 But it was the Lord's good plan to crush him and fill him with grief. Yet when his life is made an offering for sin, he will have a multitude of children, many heirs. He will enjoy a long life, and the Lord's plan will prosper in his hands.\n Isa 53:11 When he sees all that is accomplished by his anguish, he will be satisfied. And because of what he has experienced, my righteous servant will make it possible for many to be counted righteous, for he will bear all their sins.\n Isa 53:12 I will give him the honors of one who is mighty and great, because he exposed himself to death. He was counted among those who were sinners. He bore the sins of many and interceded for sinners.\n NOW, CARE TO RESPOND TO YOUR CLAIM OF HOW WE KNOW THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE DOWN TO THE BILLION, BILLIONTH OF THE SECOND?\n \n [QUOTE=Archangel;300909]Prove it! prove any of this!

And here's a link because what's below is just an excerpt. This is what I meant when i said a little research into the actual history of the Jewish people and their mishna, or traditions of the time period, you wouldn't make such ignorant misinterpretations of what such terms meant to them in proper context.\n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu.9jza9HjD4BDWpXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTExbGZsMGNtBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDOQRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAwRsA1dTMQ--/SIG=11mh8ido8/EXP=1202790115/**http%3a//www.haydid.org/sonofman.htm\n JESUS CALLS HIMSELF THE SON OF MAN. Why is this expression His favorite way of speaking about Himself? This question has perplexed the finest biblical scholars for centuries. The teaching of Jesus concerning the Son of man is difficult to understand because of its deep roots in Jewish thought contemporary with Jesus. On the one hand Jesus says that the Son of man must suffer and die, but on the other He describes Him as King who judges the nations of the world. Not surprisingly, scholars have developed quite different approaches to Jesus' sayings about the Son of man.\n \n Does the term refer to the messianic task? The eminent Oxford scholar Gena Vermes answers no. Does it refer to the humanity of Jesus? The church fathers have answered yes. But many scholars contend that the term \"Son of man\" on the lips of Jesus most certainly does make reference to the messianic task. They challenge both the position of Vermes on the one hand and the church fathers on the other.\n \n David Flusser has argued, \"The one like a man [the Son of man] who sits upon the throne of God's glory, the sublime eschatological judge, is the highest conception of the Redeemer ever developed by ancient Judaism.\" The phrase \"Son of man\" could be interpreted as a generic term meaning an ordinary human being. It could also be viewed as a messianic title that describes a superhuman figure. Jesus uses the term \"Son of man\" in the predictions He made concerning His death. Many theories have been proposed for the meaning of the expression \"Son of man\" in the teachings of Jesus. The tendency of scholars has been to establish one meaning and impose it upon the texts of the Gospels, separating the original teachings of Jesus from the editorial comments of the later church. Perhaps another approach should be considered. Here we will suggest that three different meanings may be ascribed to the technical tern \"Son of Man\" in the Gospels. A distinction must be made concerning the interpretation of the Son of man sayings. Each must be carefully examined, and the context allowed to determine the interpretation. Three meanings can be discerned in the best sources of the synoptic tradition: (1) a generic meaning, that is, a human being; (2) a superhuman figure based upon a messianic title for the eschatological coming of the judge of all humanity; (3) a complex combination of the two previous meanings as in the passion prediction of Jesus, that is, He is a human being in His sufferings and death (first meaning), and also He is more than an ordinary human being in His resurrection and triumph (associated with second meaning). The name \"Son of man\" was extremely important to Jesus. The Jewish background of His message gives fresh insight to this crucial designation in the sayings of Jesus.\n \n The Son Of Man\n In Jewish Thought\n \n First and foremost in consideration of the name \"Son of man\" in the teachings of Jesus, we must recognize the conscious effort of Jesus to refer to early Jewish interpretations of the term \"Son of man\" as a messianic title from Daniel 7:13. After all, when Jesus speaks about the end times, He uses apocalyptic imagery to communicate His message forcefully. Apocalyptic language was designed to reveal hidden matters which are known in part and difficult to grasp fully with the human mind. The apocalyptic teachings often sought to reveal the future coming of redemption. The work of the Messiah is not complete in the first coming of Jesus. But Jesus taught that the time will come in which the power and the glory of the Lord will be revealed as the Son of man appears: \"And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory\" (Luke 21:27). The mention of the cloud here in Luke 21:27 was a strong allusion to Daniel 7:13. In both Daniel and Luke the Son of man is described as coming with the clouds. It is a vision of the supernatural power of God.\n \n I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a Son of man, and He came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before Him. And to Him was given dominion and glory and kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him; His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed (Dan 7:13-14).\n \n The term \"Son of man\" in Daniel probably originally referred to the people of Israel as a collective group. But by the time of Jesus the people were looking for a person who would perform the task of the Son of man. It was natural to associate the term in Daniel with the Messiah. Hence when the early Jewish Bible translators rendered the book of Chronicles from Hebrew into Aramaic, they made a free translation in order to bring out the hidden meanings of the text which spoke about the Messiah. They believed that the task would be fulfilled by an individual rather than a collective group. When they came to the proper name Anani in 1 Chronicles 3:24, they realized that in Hebrew this name means \"cloud.\" It reminded them of Daniel 7:13 where the Son of man is described as coming with the clouds of glory. The translator called attention to the messianic idea in ancient Jewish thought. In order to bring out the natural associations between the term \"Son of man\" in Daniel, the cloud man Anani, and the royal Messiah, I Chronicles 3:24 was translated, \"Anani [the man coming with the clouds] is the King Messiah who is to be revealed.\" These Jewish Bible translator(s) saw a messianic significance for the Son of man in Daniel 7:13.\n \n The term \"Son of man,\" however, possessed a number of meanings in Hebrew and Aramaic. With the lofty associations for the name \"Son of man\" from Daniel 7:13 in clear view, it is possible to examine the significance of the designation in the words of Jesus.\n \n The Son of Man \n As A Human Being\n \n The words ben adam in Hebrew are literally translated by the phrase \"son of man\" in English. In Hebrew, however, the word for man, adam, is the same designation used for the name of the first created human being, Adam. Without going into all the theories in this brief study, it should be noted that some leading biblical scholars have proposed that the term \"Son of man\" in the Gospels is not a messianic title but rather a generic term for a human being, that is, a son or daughter of Adam, which would include every individual in the human race. While it is true that in Hebrew the words ben adam simply refer to a person, often the context of Jesus' sayings proves that Jesus goes beyond this common understanding. He alludes to Daniel 7:13 as well as to the messianic implications associated with the designation.\n \n On the other hand, some sayings of Jesus probably intend the common generic meaning. The context of the saying and the background of each Gospel text should be carefully studied. When Jesus gives a solemn warning against saying any word in opposition to the work of the Holy Spirit, he also mentions the Son of man. I believe that in this context Jesus refers to every person rather than to Himself specifically or to the future task of the Son of man in the higher redemptive purpose. The Hebrew imagery of the saying is particularly striking in Matthew's version:\n \n And whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgive, either in the age or in the age to come (Matthew 123:32; Mark 3:28-30; Luke 12:10).",

That is your M.O. though\n\n \n Oh really? You proved nothing of the sort Trebor. Here is another link that repeats the same info and Targum Johnathan is mentioned again. Very informative link...\n \n http://fourquestions.us/moshiach.php\n The common argument made by Jewish apologists today is that the \"suffering servant\" described in this passage is a reference to the Jewish nation. There are quite a few holes in that theory; however, the biggest hole is the plain fact that the suffering servant has been attributed as a claim to Moshiach by Jewish rabbis for centuries. Only in the last 50 to 100 years has it been disputed. Let's take a look:\n \n Targum Jonathan (4th Century) gives the introduction on Isa. 52:13: \"Behold, my servant the Messiah...\"\n \n Talmud, Sanhedrin 98b: Rav said: The world was created only on David's account. Samuel said: On Moses account; R. Johanan said: For the sake of the Messiah. What is his [the Messiah's] name? - The Rabbis said: His name is \"the leper scholar,\" as it is written, Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him a leper, smitten of G-d, and afflicted.\n \n Talmud, Sanhedrin 98b: Messiah... what is his name? The Rabbis say, \"the leprous one\"; those of the house of the Rabbi say: \"Cholaja\" (the sickly), for it says, \"Surely he has borne our sicknesses\" etc. (Isa. 53:4).\n \n Maimonides (1135-1204) wrote to Rabbi Jacob Alfajumi: Likewise said Isaiah that He (Messiah) would appear without acknowledging a father or mother: \"He grew up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground\" etc. (Isa.53:2).\n \n Rabbi Moses Alschech (1508-1600) says: Our Rabbis with one voice accept and affirm the opinion that the prophet is speaking of the Messiah, and we shall ourselves also adhere to the same view.\n \n Abrabanel (1437-1508) says: This is also the opinion of our own learned men in the majority of their Midrashim.\n \n Rabbi Yafeth Ben Ali (second half of the 10th Century): As for myself, I am inclined to regard it as alluding to the Messiah.\n \n Abraham Farissol (1451-1526) says: In this chapter there seem to be considerable resemblances and allusions to the work of HaMoshiach and to the events which are asserted to have happened to Him, so that no other prophecy is to be found the gist and subject of which can be so immediately applied to Him.\n \n Gersonides (1288-1344) on Devarim 18:18: In fact Messiah is such a prophet, as it is stated in the Midrash on the verse, \"Behold, my servant shall prosper...\" (Isaiah 52:13).\n \n Yalkut Schimeon (ascribed to Rabbi Simeon Kara, 12th Century) says on Zech.4:7: He (the king Messiah) is greater than the patriarchs, as it is said, \"My servant shall be high, and lifted up, and lofty exceedingly\" (Isa. 52:13).\n \n Tanchuma: Rabbi Nachman says: The Word \"man\" in the passage, \"Every man a head of the house of his father\" (Num.1,4), refers to the Messiah, the son of David, as it is written, \"Behold the man whose name is Zemach\" (the Branch) where Jonathan interprets, \"Behold the man Messiah\" (Zech.6:12); and so it is said, \"A man of pains and known to sickness\" (Isa. 53:3).\n \n Pesiqta Rabbati (ca.845) on Isa. 61:10: The world-fathers (patriarchs) will one day in the month of Nisan arise and say to (the Messiah): \"Ephraim, our righteous Anointed, although we are your grandparents, yet you are greater than we, for you have borne the sins of our children, as it says: But surely he has borne our sicknesses and carried our pains; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of G-d and afflicted. But he was pierced because of our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was laid upon him and through his wounds we are healed\"(Isa.53:4-5).\n \n Rabbi Shimon Ben Yochai (2nd Century), Zohar, part II, page 212a and part III, page 218a, Amsterdam Ed.: There is in the garden of Eden a palace called: \"The palace of the sons of sickness.\" This palace the Messiah enters, and summons every sickness, every pain, and every chastisement of Israel: they all come and rest upon Him. And were it not that He had thus lightened them off Israel, and taken them upon Himself, there had been no man able to bear Israel's chastisement for the transgression of the law; this is that which is written, \"Surely our sicknesses he has carried.\" (Isa. 53:4) As they tell Him (the Messiah) of the misery of Israel in their captivity, and of those wicked ones among them who are not attentive to know their L-rd, He lifts up His voice and weeps for their wickedness; and so it is written, \"He was wounded for our transgressions.\" (Isa.53:5)\n \n Midrash on Ruth 2:14: He is speaking of the King Messiah \"Come hither,\" i.e. Draw near to the throne; \"eat of the bread,\" i.e., The bread of the kingdom. This refers to the chastisements, as it is said, \"But he was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities.\" (Isa. 53:5)\n \n Rabbi Elijah de Vidas (16th Century): The meaning of \"He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities\" is, that since the Messiah bears our iniquities which produce the effect of His being bruised, it follows that whoever will not admit that Messiah thus suffers for our iniquities must endure and suffer for them himself.\n \n Sifre: Rabbi Jose the Galilean said, \"Come and learn the merits of the King Messiah and the reward of the Just - from the first man who received but one commandment, a prohibition, and transgressed it. Consider how many deaths were inflicted upon himself, upon his own generation, and upon those who followed them, till the end of all generations. Which attribute is greater, the attribute of goodness, or the attribute of vengeance?\" He answered, \"The attribute of goodness is greater, and the attribute of vengeance is the less.\" - \"How much more then, will the King Messiah, who endures affliction and pains for the transgressions (as it is written, 'He was wounded,' etc.), justify all generations. This is the meaning of the word, 'And the L-rd made the iniquity of us all to meet upon Him'\" (Isa. 53:6).\n \n Rabbi Eleazer Kalir (9th Century) is credited with writing the following Yom Kippur Musaf prayer, although there is some evidence that it dates back to the first century C.E.: Our righteous Messiah has departed from us. Horror has seized us and we have no one to justify us. He has borne our transgressions and the yoke of our iniquities, and is wounded because of our transgressions. He bore our sins upon His shoulders that we may find pardon for our iniquity. We shall be healed by His wounds, at the time when the Eternal will recreate Him a new creature. Oh bring Him up from the circle of the earth, raise Him up from Seir, that we may hear Him the second time.\n \n Rabbi Moses, \"The Preacher\" (11th Century) wrote in his commentary on Genesis (page 660): From the beginning G-d has made a covenant with the Messiah and told Him, \"My righteous Messiah, those who are entrusted to you, their sins will bring you into a heavy yoke\" ... And He answered, \"I gladly accept all these agonies in order that not one of Israel should be lost.\" Immediately, the Messiah accepted all agonies with love, as it is written: \"He was oppressed and he was afflicted.\"\n \n Pesiqta (on Isa. 61:10): Great oppressions were laid upon You, as it says: \"By oppression and judgement he was taken away; but who considered in his time, that he was cut off out of the land of the living, that he was stricken because of the sins of our children\" (Isa. 53:8), as it says: \"But the LORD has laid on him the guilt of us all\". (Isa.53:6)\n \n I don't think that much in the way of conclusions is necessary for this section. The rabbis very obviously connected Isaiah 53 to the Moshiach, and they show multiple times that the Moshiach definitely suffers. For what or whom does he suffer? Apparently for the people.",
