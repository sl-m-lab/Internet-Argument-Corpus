Being with a gay parent is no more or less risky than being with a straight parent. Look at what the two parents have to offer, check the background (not their sexuality) and see who the child wants to be with. Man, what would the judge do if the father was gay too... lol... \"Your children will now be but up for adoption. I will save them from you loving parents.\"\n \n I'm guessing AA's post got deleted... since there is only the quote left. What is up with the names?
