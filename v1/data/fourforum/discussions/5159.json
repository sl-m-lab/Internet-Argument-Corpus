   "Research Shows Gay Marriage Reduces VD\n An associate professor in the Department of Economics at Swarthmore College has written a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research that shows how in Europe, where same-sex relationships have been granted legal recognition since 1989 (beginning in Denmark), there is a correlation between same-sex marriage (or civil unions) and a decline in the rate of at least one sexually transmitted disease, syphilis.\n \n In \"Forsaking All Others? The Effects of 'Gay Marriage' on Risky Sex,\" Thomas S. Dee writes:\n \n One of the conjectured benefits of establishing the legal recognition of same sex partnerships is that it would promote a culture of responsibility and commitment among homosexuals. A specific implication of this claim is that \"gay marriage\" will reduce the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI). In this study, I present a simple 2-period model, which provides a framework for discussing the ways in which gay marriage might reduce (or increase) the prevalence of STI. Then, I present reduced-form empirical evidence on whether gay marriage has actually reduced STI rates. These evaluations are based on country-level panel data from Europe, where nations began introducing national recognition of same-sex partnerships in 1989. The results suggest that these gay marriage laws led to statistically significant reductions in syphilis rates. However, these effects were smaller and statistically imprecise with respect to gonorrhea and HIV. [from the paper's abstract]\n \n Professor Dee is no neophyte or quirky economist working on a pet project. He has contributed articles to numerous academic journals and chapters to several books, including No Child Left Behind?: The Politics and Practice of School Accountability, Developments in School Finance, and An Economic Analysis of Risky Behavior Among Youths.\n \n Dee's concluding paragraph suggests the impact on both the U.S. economy and public health that could ensue from legalizing gay relationships:\n \n These results suggest that gay marriage might reduce, perhaps dramatically, the social costs associated with STI like syphilis. In the United States, over 34,000 cases of 25 syphilis were reported in 2003 (CDC 2004b). And the direct and indirect annual costs of syphilis have been estimated at nearly $1 billion, which reflects in large part, the role that syphilis plays in spreading HIV (CDC 1999). However, the policy relevance of these results probably extends beyond the issue of improvements in public health. For many who are debating the desirability of gay marriage, these results may be more important because of what they suggest about the likely effects of gay marriage on the degree of personal commitment in same-sex relationships.\n \n \n The full paper provides extensive economic analysis, including charts and graphs, and is worth reading for all those concerned about the prospect of equal-marriage rights in the United States -- whether proponents or opponents of the concept.\n http://ricksincerethoughts.blogspot.com/2005/05/research-shows-gay-marriage-reduces-vd.html",

I think the problem is that monogamy and homosexality have rarely gone hand in hand. In the words of someone who's been a part of that world . . .\n\n \n You listen to the words of the people who have left that world: the words of the people who have had the absolute worst experiences. Their words accurately represent only their own experiences, most likely with the irresponsbile subculture of homosexuals that I have mentioned in the past. But the vast majority of gay people do not leave the world of homosexuality, and it's their words you need to hear. You've listened to the words of people who have had the worst experience when you should be listening to the words of the people who have had the best, or even the average experience.\n \n Same-sex relationships are about monogamy as much as opposite-sex relationships. Ask Justine if her relationship is fragile or strong and committed. Ask anyone here in a long-term relationship that question. Ask me whether I ever plan on engaging in promiscuity, anonymous sex, or irresponsible sex. Two testimonies of people who claim to be ex-gay listed on a conservative website claiming that gay relationships are unstable and not monogamous means nothing when ninty-nine percent of gay people claim just the opposite.\n \n Yet it is fact that legalizing same-sex marriage will increase the monogamy and commitment of same-sex couples as a whole. It is also fact that removing opposite-sex marriage would decrease the monogamy and commitment of opposite-sex couples as a whole. Legal marriage makes some people feel the bonds of commitment more than no legal recognition, and that holds true for every group of people everywhere. To suggest that this is evidence that gay people do not engage relationships as committed as opposite-sex couples is irrational and unfounded. \n \n There are plenty of incredibly committed same-sex couples today, and there will be a few more if same-sex marriage is legalized because our laws teach people. This is no different from any other group of people; the idea that opposite-sex couples would not exhibit the same behavior is not valid.",

   "Research Shows Gay Marriage Reduces VD\n An associate professor in the Department of Economics at Swarthmore College has written a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research that shows how in Europe, where same-sex relationships have been granted legal recognition since 1989 (beginning in Denmark), there is a correlation between same-sex marriage (or civil unions) and a decline in the rate of at least one sexually transmitted disease, syphilis.\n \n In \"Forsaking All Others? The Effects of 'Gay Marriage' on Risky Sex,\" Thomas S. Dee writes:\n \n One of the conjectured benefits of establishing the legal recognition of same sex partnerships is that it would promote a culture of responsibility and commitment among homosexuals. A specific implication of this claim is that \"gay marriage\" will reduce the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI). In this study, I present a simple 2-period model, which provides a framework for discussing the ways in which gay marriage might reduce (or increase) the prevalence of STI. Then, I present reduced-form empirical evidence on whether gay marriage has actually reduced STI rates. These evaluations are based on country-level panel data from Europe, where nations began introducing national recognition of same-sex partnerships in 1989. The results suggest that these gay marriage laws led to statistically significant reductions in syphilis rates. However, these effects were smaller and statistically imprecise with respect to gonorrhea and HIV. [from the paper's abstract]\n \n Professor Dee is no neophyte or quirky economist working on a pet project. He has contributed articles to numerous academic journals and chapters to several books, including No Child Left Behind?: The Politics and Practice of School Accountability, Developments in School Finance, and An Economic Analysis of Risky Behavior Among Youths.\n \n Dee's concluding paragraph suggests the impact on both the U.S. economy and public health that could ensue from legalizing gay relationships:\n \n These results suggest that gay marriage might reduce, perhaps dramatically, the social costs associated with STI like syphilis. In the United States, over 34,000 cases of 25 syphilis were reported in 2003 (CDC 2004b). And the direct and indirect annual costs of syphilis have been estimated at nearly $1 billion, which reflects in large part, the role that syphilis plays in spreading HIV (CDC 1999). However, the policy relevance of these results probably extends beyond the issue of improvements in public health. For many who are debating the desirability of gay marriage, these results may be more important because of what they suggest about the likely effects of gay marriage on the degree of personal commitment in same-sex relationships.\n \n \n The full paper provides extensive economic analysis, including charts and graphs, and is worth reading for all those concerned about the prospect of equal-marriage rights in the United States -- whether proponents or opponents of the concept.\n http://ricksincerethoughts.blogspot.com/2005/05/research-shows-gay-marriage-reduces-vd.html\n\n Yes, and it reduces a much needed population growth too. emoticon_xgood",

Early testers (n=1573) were defined as people who had their first positive HIV test </= 5 years before the diagnosis of AIDS or who spent </= 5 years without a diagnosis of AIDS after their first positive test. Late testers (n=1877) were those who had their first positive HIV test 1 year or less before the diagnosis of AIDS.
