You really can't pin Jesus' teachings down to either one, and both could cherry-pick things to support their position on politics. It's unfortunate, because to use Jesus to back either position is beside the greater meaning of his teachings, IMO. His teachings were no more meant to be a lesson in political civics than a science lesson in astrophysics and abiogenesis.",

   "Tax is permitted for the common good. Joseph levied 20% of the harvest, \"to be held in reserve for the country\". Taxation is not theft.\n\n \n Absolutely--20% is a much more moral tax rate. That would be fantastic. Unfortunately for your argument, tax rates run more around 40% from $20,000-$500,000 annual income. So, if you really care about being more Christ-like on this issue, you will need to be fighting for lower taxes on people.\n \n \"Politicians rarely talk about what real people experience: the true maze of taxes and government benefits. If someone put them all together, we could see what our actual tax burden was. We could see who pays at the highest or lowest rates. Discussions of tax policy wouldn't be a waste of time.\n Well, two researchers did it.\n In a study for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Boston University economists Laurence J. Kotlikoff and David Rapson have found that our all-in marginal tax rate is 40%, give or take a bit. Yes, you read that right: 40%.\n \n Most workers will pay about that much on each dollar of income when all taxes -- federal and state income taxes, sales taxes, taxes for benefit programs, etc. -- are considered.\n As a consequence, a 30-year-old couple earning only $20,000 a year has a marginal tax rate of 42.5%, while a 45-year-old couple earning $500,000 pays at 43.2%. There are some exceptions: A 30-year-old couple earning $50,000 a year, for instance, pays 24.4%, and a 60-year-old couple making $150,000 a year faces a tax rate of 47.7%.\n The average marginal tax rate on incomes between $20,000 and $500,000 is 40.3%, the median tax rate is 41.8%, and the standard deviation of all of those rates is 5.3 percentage points. Basically, most of us pay about 40%, plus or minus 5.3 percentage points.\"Is there ever a point that you would view taxes as immorally too high? emoticon_rolleyes",

   "I'm saying taxation is not forbidden, and is certainly not theft.\n\n \n Well the bible certainly isn't explicit about it, that's for sure. Then again it isn't too clear on state-sponsored murder either. I doubt the bible would have survived if it had been.\n \n But I hardly think the story of Joseph is meant to mean \"Joseph was a cool dude, and whatever he did is a-OK\".\n \n The explicit lesson taken from it is usually that being a servant to god is better than losing your soul, just like being a slave to the pharaoh is better than starving.\n \n But there are also underlying messages;\n \n The people of Egypt are ultimately enslaved because of their failure to save during the boom years. Undoubtedly there was some kind of crank economist / priest there at the time urging them to speculate on the price of incense and assuring them the good times would keep on rolling.\n \n Joseph, despite his good intentions, is ultimately corrupted by power. Whether you believe this took place when he became an agent of the pharaoh and advocated an extraordinary tax or afterwards is debatable, he certainly appears to have had good intentions at the time. But do consider the historical context - 20% may seem low now, at the time it would have been seen as very large, even tyrannical. \n \n You have to wonder how many egyptians refused to pay (probably a lot) and were consequently beaten, enslaved or killed by the pharaoh's enforcers as a result. Saying you approve of taxation means you approve of enforcing punishment (and ultimately murder, if they resist) against those who don't pay.\n \n Joseph tries to look out for his people, providing them with plenty even as the native egyptians starve. It's at once a remarkable tale of forgiveness, but the dark side is that they essentially profit off the blood of the egyptians. Maybe this is justified, since they are the chosen people.

   "According to Genesis Egypt has enough grain to survive the lean years and to sell to other nations nearby as a result of the tax.\n\n \n You mean the pharaoh had plenty of grain. The people themselves did not. There was a famine, and if they couldn't afford the prices the pharaoh & joseph were charging for the food they had taxed, the people starved, or were acquired by joseph as slaves.\n \n Except the hebrews of course,\n \n Genesis 47:\n \n  11And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. \n \n 12And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families. \n \n 13And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. \n \n 14And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. \n \n 15And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth. \n \n 16And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail. \n \n 17And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year. \n \n 18When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands: \n \n 19Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate. \n \n 20And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's. \n \n 21And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof. \n \n 22Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands. \n \n 23Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. \n \n 24And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones. \n \n 25And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.  - here's where joseph uses his tax revenue to buy the native egyptians as slaves, serfs or indentured servants\n \n 26And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's. \n \n 27And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly. \n \n Exodus:\n \n 8Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. \n \n 9And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we: \n \n 10Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land. \n \n 11Therefore they did set over them [the hebrews] taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. \n \n \nIncidentally a modern equivalent of this would be Norway's sovereign wealth fund, storing up the revenues from oil against the day when it runs out.\n\n \n Yeah it's kind of like that. Except when the oil runs out, Norways King uses the oil money to buy up all the norwegian land and declares the people of norway his slaves, except for ethnic aryans who he showers with gifts.",
