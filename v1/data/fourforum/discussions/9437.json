I really do try to treat others the way I want to be treated. I'm not sure what religion you follow (if any at all), but I am personally Christian, so I try to follow Jesus' teaching. My moral view is sort of expressed in these passages:\n \n  Matthew 7\n \n Do Not Judge Others\n \n \n \"Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. 2 For you will be treated as you treat others. The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged.\n \n 3 \"And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye when you have a log in your own? 4 How can you think of saying to your friend, 'Let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye? 5 Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.\n \n 6 \"Don't waste what is holy on people who are unholy. Don't throw your pearls to pigs! They will trample the pearls, then turn and attack you.\n \n and\n \n The Golden Rule\n \n \n 12 \"Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you. This is the essence of all that is taught in the law and the prophets.\n \n These are both from the Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, and that is pretty much what I follow.\n \n I also agree with you on abortion: before I existed mentally (around third trimester), I did not exist at all. I also agree that after mental existence comes into play (around third trimester), there must be a really good reason for abortion, such as the woman's life is at risk, or her health is severely threatened.",

   "This is wrong. You yourself find \"mental existence\" to be \"sacred' in a way. There is no rational argument for mental existence being the point of obtaining rights...no matter how hard any of us try :p\n\n I don't find mental existence \"sacred\" - after all, I accept the fact that military action is sometimes necessary where people get killed, I accept people killing when necessary for self-defence, etc. My moral approach comes from the OBSERVATION that when I think of myself, I don't think of my body alone, I think mainly of my mind where I view my body as being, in a sense, owned by my mind. It is my understanding of myself that comes from self-observation, not from a proclamation. \n \n The \"treat others as I would have myself be treated\" is a statement but one which has rational reasons behind it and is, therefore, not merely a proclamation. I want to be treated in certain ways because being treated otherwise leads me to suffering, and I don't like to suffer (that is also not a proclamation, just an observation). It is illogical for me to propose a moral code that states that I should be treated one way and all others another way. Sure, I can propose that but it would be ludicrous - why would anyone accept that as a code? I would also laugh at someone who would present to me a moral code where I would treat them better than myself. Moral codes are codes which societies try to follow. Chaos would erupt if there were no moral codes. I choose a code that makes some logical sense by being at least self-consistent so that it has the least chance of being accepted by others as a universal code. The option is chaos, and I personally prefer to avoid chaos.",

   "But your hypothetical situation has no basis in the real world. There IS no guarantee that the foetus would ever even develop into a baby.\n\n \n There is not a 100% guarantee. But a large percentage do. Enough of a percentage to make a moral difference. For example, a fetus has developed into a baby over 6 billion times in the last one-hundred years or so. I don't think that my overall point can be pooh-poohed by simply saying there is no guarantee that a fetus will develop into a baby. \n \n \nI wasn't arguing that because it is \"brain-dead\" (your implication, not mine), that it means what you are saying. I am saying that if death is determined by the end of mental activity it logically follows that life is determined by the beginning of mental activity.\n\n \n And I am suggesting that the definition of \"death\" would be different in Brainiac's case. Essentially, I am stating an assumed (but necessary) premise in your conclusion. You say that the end of mental activity is the definition of death. But it really should be more like the following: the end of mental activity with a low probability of recovery. This was what I was trying to point out. Intuitively, we would think very differently about someone being removed from life support who we knew had a good chance of recovering from brain-death than we would someone in the same scenario who we knew had no chance of recovering.\n \n Thus, my suggestion that your conclusion has a hidden, but very necessary premise: the premise that the patient will not recover.\n \n \nYou can say that it is potential life, in that it might eventually become a living person. A woman, however, should not have her choice taken away because of some potential. Otherwise you could go and argue that you shouldn't ever cross a street because of the potential of being hit by car. If we live by potentials, we'd have a pretty poor life.\n\n \n This is a very different justification for abortion. In the first scenario, I think it was being suggested that the embryo could ethically be killed simply because it did not have a mental existence. I.e., the embryo has no ethical value whatsoever.\n \n In this scenario, however, it is being suggested that whatever value the embryo has, a woman possesses the right to her own body. That is a very different claim, and does not erase the ethical concerns with respect to the embryo. It is akin to a caretaker that says, \"though Braniac has an outstanding chance to recover, it would cost way to much to see him through his recovery. Therefore, we shall pull the plug.\"\n \n And besides that, the idea of \"potentiality\" applies also to third trimester pregnancies. The fetus, though now in possession of mental existence, is still only potentially a born baby.\n \n \nA woman, however, should not have her choice taken away because of some potential.\n\n \n But you, as I understand it, do want the woman's choice taken away at the third trimester (with some rare exceptions, I believe).",

   "Jyoshu pretty much answered for me so I won't go back but I will say that your morality is formed based on arbitrary things as well. Whether you believe in a god or make yourself god you still are making arbitrary rules for which you develop a morality.\n \n The idea that you don't want to suffer and therefore came up with this morality is abritrary as everything we have stated. Why wasn't the conclusion \"I dont' want to suffer so be stronger than everyone else\" or \"I don't want to suffer so don't associate with anyone else\". Or maybe the conslusion could be to believe in a religion. Either way, you are going to have to believe in something and that forms the basis for a morality.\n\n My stance on morality is based on the following observations:\n 1. \"I\" for me means my mental self, with my physical self just tagging along.\n 2. I do not wish to suffer or to have those I care about suffer.\n 3. I feel empathy toward others and often feel sorry for the suffering of others.\n Those are observations, not proclamations.\n The way I choose a moral code to avoid the problem of suffering is to essentially make a theoretical deal with others to have a mutual moral code that we will all treat each other as we ourselves would be treated - in this way, all of us can win out and I solve my problem of points 2 and 3. Perhaps there are other better ways of finding a solution for societies to avoid suffering, but I haven't heard of one. I did not choose this solution arbitrarily. I chose it since it makes sense and should theoretically work and since many, if not most people, at least make some effort at using that moral code anyway so this moral code is at least partially universally adopted. It is the best moral option I have ever heard to address my concern about suffering.\n \n What is arbitrary about the reasoning I presented above? What unsupported proclamations do you claim that I have made?\n \n Either way, are you proposing that all moral systems are equally arbitrary and therefore equally valid? In your scenario, someone could come up with an arbitrary proclamation \"black people should be slaves to white people\" and build a morality based on that.

   "Because to not view it as sacred presents a greater potential for harm. People sometimes to take a disposable view of things that they consider unimportant. To view humanity as sacred helps protect humanity.\n\n Many of us view humanity with mental existence as important. The only ones you are protecting that our view does not are those human living entities with no mental existence. How can you even talk about \"harm\" to a living entity with no mental existence? Are you \"harming\" and egg or sperm by throwing them out? Are you \"harming\" a brain dead body that is being artificially kept alive on a machine by unplugging it? Also, if the potential of a pre-mental-existence fetus is important to you, why isn't the potential of a unfertilized egg? \n \nYou think most people would incorporate the golden rule? I don't think so--I think most people are willing to make a buck off of others (business ventures), land that job they want before someone else gets it, curse someone for cutting them off in traffic, get that parking spot before the guy coming around the corner gets it, or even get in an intentionally insulting dig to someone in a discussion forum such as this. The examples could go on and on ... I think a lot of people like to THINK they incorporate the golden rule, but at close, honest examination would find that they rarely do.\n\n The golden rule is not just one sided. It does not expect us to do all giving and no taking. I have expectations of how others should treat me (the taking part) but, to be consistent, I should realize that they have expectations of me (the giving part). Though people may want to win out in a job interview over someone more qualified, most don't morally expect that that should happen since they realize that that expectation would not be fair. They may make a buck off of a person but, unless they are con artists who lie to get that buck, most will do it in a way they consider fair, under laws they themselves would be willing to live under. (As a side note: Even most con artists might admit that, if they themselves were conned, then they would have deserved it for being suckers.) The rule of treating others as we would want or expect to be treated doesn't necessarily lead to a hugely generous society - just to one that seems to minimize suffering in a realistically achievable way.\n \nIn short, I think this analogy needs to be reconsidered because of one important fact: a person who is brain-dead will never recover from that state no matter how much medical treatment is given, whereas an embryo who is \"brain-dead\" most certainly will fully recover from that state in a relatively short amount of time if left alone.\n\n What you are talking about here is the *potential* to exist being important. I would personally also thinking that potential existence is important, but not nearly as important as an existing person. After all, unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss. For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important. \n \n For both the 'braniac\" case you present and for the early term fetus, if there is no reason to kill it, then don't. However, if there is a contest between the rights of a living, existing person and the rights of either *potential* person, then I think the rights of the living person win out.",

I strongly believe that we have to try our hardest to incorporate reason in our sense of morality for it to not be arbitrary and to reduce human suffering. Though there are many religious proclamations that have reduced human suffering, others have made it worse (as in the proclamation against gays or Islam's proclamations of the inferiority of all women). A majority in a society may declare a standard but that does not make that standard right unless there are fully explored reasons behind it. US society once adopted the standard \"black people should be slaves to white people\" but any reasoning that was put behind that standard was based on faulty logic (ex. justifying slavery by assuming that black people where automatically inferior, without any evidence to support that claim). Reason and logic can very much help in eliminating such unfair moral proclamations.",

However, I place the rights of a REAL person far above the hypothetical rights of a POTENTIAL person since what IS is more important than what MIGHT BE. An unfertilized egg also has the potential of becoming a real person. The only difference between the fertilized and unfertilized egg is in the physical change of having a second set of human DNA put into it either naturally (through sperm injecting this second set) or artificially, which is a lower probability occurence - thus limiting its chances of becoming a person. There are many physical changes and external influences that are introduced to an embryo to allow it to grow into a person. The embryo is simply much farther along in the process than the unfertilized egg and with a much higher chance of becoming a person. It is only a matter of degree. \n \nUpon reviewing the golden rule \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\" I see nothing of any other 'side.' It's very clear--treat others the way you'd want to be treated.

If you know that you have to treat others in the same way, then you may not make your golden rule as generous. If, for example, you expect people to share all of their possessions with you, that means that you have to be willing to share all of your possessions with them. That is why people scale back their expectations on either side. There are limits to what they are willing to give so they accept that there are limits to what they should expect to take from others. Different people strike this balance differently, but I think most keep this balance in mind. They don't really expect others to treat them better than they treat others.

I wouldn't want to be an employer forced to hire an incompetent because of his need, not because of his qualifications.

There is no reason why someone else of another completely random belief system could not also sit back an claim without proof that \"My morality is right and yours is wrong\". \n \n One of my goals in discussing morality is that, if we don't have SOME common moral goals to work off of, then there is no chance whatsoever of reaching some moral consensus, morality is arbitrary, and we risk the moarl chaos that I would think we are trying to avoid. \n \nWell, perhaps it is rational based on the assumptions you made.

I do not wish to suffer or to have those I care about suffer.\n 3. I feel empathy toward others and often feel sorry for the suffering of others.\n \n These are observations I made about myself that haven't been taught or randomly reached. Other people might observe other things about themselves (ex. some people seem to get a certain satisfaction out of suffering) so, from that point of view, there is some arbitrariness to my observations of myself since others may not have the same observations about themselves. However, just because others may have other observations about themselves doesn't make my observation a proclamation. As a side note, to be completely accurate about observations 2 and 3, I have to admit that there are rare occasions when I am angry at a loved one and do want them to slightly suffer and there are various people with whom I would find it very difficult to empathize. \n \n Moral proclamations tend to run along the line that something \"should\" be a particular way in an absolute way.

I am not trying to force my moral system on others. I only try to convince others through force of reason and arguement. Similarly, pro-life proponents do not have the right to force their moral system on me but they are welcome to try to convince me through force of reason and arguement. That reason and arguement leads nowhere if it comes down to a proclamation (such as \"all human life is sacred\") that we don't agree on. Then it is a battle of numbers - i.e. majority wins - and nothing else. That would force the minority to suffer under the repellent system of the majority. That is what I am hoping to avoid in these discussions - I am trying to find a common moral language that we can use to find a compromise.",

Yes (We agree that it high but not 100% probability since there are also many natural causes that stop it.). \n \n Is the newly fertilized egg a person yet? No. Does it have a moderate probability of becoming a person? Yes - many more things go wrong with newly fertilized eggs than with fetuses and many more \"spontaneously abort\" so the probability is significantly lower than for early fetuses but still what I would call \"moderate\".\n \n Is the unfertilized egg a person yet? No. Does it have some probability of becoming a person? Yes - beyond the risks of a newly fertilized egg, it also needs to get fertilized (which is a fairly low probability).\n \n Even the newly fertilized egg is far from certain of becoming a person. Do you claim that the degree of probability of becoming a person is what matters most?\n \n Otherwise, you claim that the active stopping of the natural process is what is wrong. Then, from that view, you would claim that the active stopping of fertilization via contraception is wrong since it prevents the natural process from happening that would lead to a person. The egg that would otherwise have been fertilized will not be, so you have stopped the growth that WOULD have happened if its fertilization hadn't been artificially stopped. The unfertilized egg of a fertile couple during sex had an almost equal probability of becoming a person as does a newly fertilized egg but contraception stopped it so contraception must be wrong - no?\n \nHow many people have you ever known that took the philosophy \"I don't want people to be nice to me\"?

The golden rule requires that they also treat others the same way - that is where the compromise happens. In certain situations, they don't always want to be nice to people so they can't expect people to be nice to them in those situations. They may not want to share their belongings with others so they cannot expect others to share their belongings with them. The golden rule works in BOTH directions not just ONE direction - it requires \"give\" , not just \"take\". People are limited in how much they are willing to give to others so they accept that they have to be limited in how much they morally EXPECT to take from others.\n \n I think we simply have a differing understanding of the golden rule. To \"treat others as I would have myself be treated\" requires less of me than \"to treat others as I would WANT to be treated\" since it only requires a moral rule that I would be willing to mutually live with.

There is no reason why someone else of another completely random belief system could not also sit back an claim without proof that \"My morality is right and yours is wrong\". \n \n One of my goals in discussing morality is that, if we don't have SOME common moral goals to work off of, then there is no chance whatsoever of reaching some moral consensus, morality is arbitrary, and we risk the moarl chaos that I would think we are trying to avoid. \n So you do not believe in a moral absolute then. This is fine but you must understand that this means you can't criticize other moral belief systems as being wrong. \n \n \n \n\n I am not completely following you here, but you seem to claim that my three observations are really proclamations:\n 1. \"I\" for me means my mental self, with my physical self just tagging along.\n 2. I do not wish to suffer or to have those I care about suffer.\n 3. I feel empathy toward others and often feel sorry for the suffering of others.\n \n These are observations I made about myself that haven't been taught or randomly reached. Other people might observe other things about themselves (ex. some people seem to get a certain satisfaction out of suffering) so, from that point of view, there is some arbitrariness to my observations of myself since others may not have the same observations about themselves. However, just because others may have other observations about themselves doesn't make my observation a proclamation. As a side note, to be completely accurate about observations 2 and 3, I have to admit that there are rare occasions when I am angry at a loved one and do want them to slightly suffer and there are various people with whom I would find it very difficult to empathize. \n \n Moral proclamations tend to run along the line that something \"should\" be a particular way in an absolute way. I am not claiming that there are no valid alternatives to my moral system - there are. I think people should have a right to follow whatever moral system they wish as long as their moral system does not impinge on the rights of others. I am not trying to force my moral system on others. I only try to convince others through force of reason and arguement. Similarly, pro-life proponents do not have the right to force their moral system on me but they are welcome to try to convince me through force of reason and arguement. That reason and arguement leads nowhere if it comes down to a proclamation (such as \"all human life is sacred\") that we don't agree on. Then it is a battle of numbers - i.e. majority wins - and nothing else. That would force the minority to suffer under the repellent system of the majority. That is what I am hoping to avoid in these discussions - I am trying to find a common moral language that we can use to find a compromise.\n\n You can't find a compromise when you have a different basis for morality. This \"proclamation\" of all human life being sacred is not one that just came out of thin air but rather the morality system set into place. Your morality system, which is no provable than mine, says that the proclamation that came out of mine is just not true to your own morals. There really can't be a common language when you come from two directions and get two different answers. The only way to convince the other would be to show the others moral system is wrong. With a relative approach to morals you really can't say my system is wrong....so that's out.",

   "The philosopher Kant, who seems to be the most referenced philosopher when it comes to issues of secular morality, explored the details of moral philosophy and came up with an alternate way of expressing it which he called the Categorical Imperative: \"Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it would become a universal law\". This means that any moral law you make would have to be applied to everyone - including yourself. \n \n I suspect that, when you are thinking of the \"golden rule\", you think more of the one stated by Jesus which is assumed to have a benevolent goal given who it was that stated it. However, as with Kant, there are versions of this law that do not automatically assume that benevolence is necessary. Some degree of benevolence just seems to be automatic, on average, in most societies since most people do seem to be willing to do some giving to others in order to make a society which is nicer to live in.\n\n \n Yes, I do view the golden rule in the sense that Christ meant it. Let me say then that my view is that an assumed benevolent goal is the golden rule I think is the more rational view. Given that, I still feel that a rational morality is one that needs to be tempered and checked and accompanied by compassion. Sorry I didn't realize we were talking about two different things.\n \n \nI also notice you say again here that the unfertlilized egg will absolutely not become a person. May I ask what species would happen to be as you must not be human (who, in the end, do come from these eggs) ? Some extra-terrestrial species that does not use eggs? You're almost making me start to beleive aliens exist .\n\n \n Don't be ridiculous.

Given that, I still feel that a rational morality is one that needs to be tempered and checked and accompanied by compassion. Sorry I didn't realize we were talking about two different things.\n\n I agree that adding compassion as well as reason to morality is a good approach. I just don't know how easy that would be to universally adopt. I think by our very biological natures, there seems to be some level of compassion \"built in\". Even apes have been shown to show compassion to other apes in certain situations. (This arguement assumes you agree with evolution and that this shows some biological basis to compassion). However, greed and selfishness are unfortunately also strong driving forces that often win out. \n \n In moral discussions, an appeal to compassion wins out for those who are predisposed to that anyway but I suspect that it falls on deaf ears for those for whom compassion takes a definite backseat to selfishness. However, the golden rule in the form of \"How would you like it if you were treated that way\" often does work to convince a much wider range of people to act in ways that ultimately show more compassion. It is a moral approach that far more people seem to accept and follow, so far more people can be swayed by its arguements. In a way, it is partly a selfish approach because many will agree to treat others fairly only so that they themselves are treated fairly. However, though it might ultimately have selfish motivations, it has a better chance of reaching the ultimate goal of a more peaceful and compassionate society.\n \n Perhaps we should not be referring to it as the \"golden rule\" since that might imply the automatically benevolent Jesus version, but I don't have a better name for it except for possibly refering to Kant's Categorical Imperative instead.",

I also think someones moral code is often different from a natural tendency. For example, I feel most people are probably naturally selfish but we enact a moral code to try and reduce this.\n\n I would agree that many people don't have a clearly set-out moral code and just follow what \"feels\" right to them without analyzing why that would be right. Often, what \"feels\" right to them is based on selfish concerns but also often it is based on compassionate ones or ones based on empathy and mutual equal treatment. That is partly why such discussions about the moral underpinnings of views on abortion (and other subjects) are useful. They not only help us understand the opponents point of view but also help us clarify our own. Discussions can not only help us convince others of our point of view but also have the ability to teach us and change our own view based on reasons presented by the oposition which we have not considered.\n \n However, as I mentioned before, for discussions to be useful in reaching any compromise BOTH parties need to be willing to compromise and BOTH parties need to have reasons behind their views which they can present to sway the opposition. \n \n I quite openly state that my moral views are not fixed but can certainly change if valid reasons are presented for that view to change. I am open to the arguements of reason. What I am hearing from you is that you are not. Your moral stance is not ultimately based on reason but on blind faith that the moral code of the religion which you practice is the right one. I suppose that, even in a situation where only one side is willing to listen to reason, then the opposing side (pro-life) has the opportunity to convince that side (pro-choice) of their view through reasoned arguement. However, if all you present is unsupported proclamations, then you fail in that attempt. That leaves no room for reasoned discussion since neither side will move and we are left back with a fight for numbers for a majority vote.\n \n Well, since I think I have an understanding of your views now and you have an understanding of mine, nothing more will probably be gained by the moral discussions between the two of us except to repeat in various ways the things we have already stated. For me, that still leaves other pro-choice advocates such as jyoshu (whose moral stance does seem to have more of a basis in reasoned arguement than yours) to continue these moral discussions with.\n \nAnyway, even if a compromise is never reached, I think such discussions are useful if only to expose the fact that neither side is composed of monsters but of people with approaches that just happen to be quite different.\nhaha, yet both sides have their monsters.\n\n Yes, both sides still have their monsters as well. However, I feel that, when dealing with emotionally charged \"monsters\", it is best not to prod them with insulting posts (that will just make them more of a monster) but to calm them with the \"sweet music\" of calm, rational discussion.

   "This assumes brain-dead is a logical choice to consider one dead. Even so, it proves nothing about when life begins. What says they have to be the same? This is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise.\n\n \n Not necessarily. When \"life\" begins is irrelevant, because flowers and weeds don't have rights yet they are a life form. The thing that determines rights is intelligence. Not how much or how little, but whether someone has it at all. A spec of dirt has no intelligence. It won't pop up and say \"hey! How ya doin!\" unless you're on crack. We've actually killed intelligent entities for less than the consequences of carrying out an unwanted pregnancy. We hunt, and we go to war. Even though I do not agree with war, I do agree with hunting, and I myself hunt on occasion. However, that is off topic. The point is, carrying out an unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects, and those next 18 years could hold her back from her life. Its awful how she will have to liver her life. If she gets an abortion, the embryo does not (to quote another opinion) \"mentally exist\". Now, hunting is really only done for recreation, and maybe a good meal. They would've been almost just as well off if they went to the local taco bell. Sure, they'd prefer hunting, but its really only done for fun and exercise. I, myself, value an animal over an embryo at its current stage. The only reason I don't completely think an animal is worth more is because that embryo has a chance of becoming a human. Then again, the animal does mentally exist and has full awareness, and the embryo is really just a sitting cellular watersack with no organs.",
