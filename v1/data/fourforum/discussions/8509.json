   "disagree with him on lots of things. He did create the child, it just takes some time to become a full human. But I think the better argument is since a woman can have an abortion without the father's permission, why can't the father opt out of having the baby? As long as it's early enough to have the abortion, the father can remove all responsibility to the baby. In doing so he also removes all rights to the baby if it is born because it is not legally his. Do people agree with this?",

   "America is all about equality for man and woman.\n\n \n I don't know if that's what America is \"about\" per se, the principles of individual rights the nation of America was founded on do imply that all people are equal, in the sense, and in only the sense, that they possess the same set of rights.\n \n \nthen why can't a man opt out of fatherhood when a mass of tissue is just that a mass a tissue.\n\n \n I believe a man should be able to opt out of fatherhood.\n \n The problem with this article for me is the moral ambiguity - there is no consistent argument laid out for free choice, that is choice for women and men, or even one for consistent slavery (forced births from women, forced money from men). It reeks of the vindictiveness that can be seen in any number of fringe movements, of the \"I don't really care whether we live in a just society, as long as you're not treated better than me\".\n \n So yes, I \"a real pro-choicer\" agree with Matt here, the pro-choicers who are portrayed as disagreeing appear to be some kind of stereotyped 1970s feminist-socialist-activist-bra-burning type.\n \n \nSo really all matt wants to do is have equal say when a mass of tissue is at stake, he too should be able to execute his wishes or choice, like the woman can exercise her wishes or choice. Now that's is equality.\n\n \n I'm not sure that that is what Matt is saying, or that that is morally defensible. Suppose your lungs are at stake, I should have a right to decide if you smoke, is that what you are arguing?",

   "If a man fathers a child, granted that now, because of feminism, it is harder for a man to avoid responsibility for his children, many men still succeed at avoiding their responsibilities as fathers.\n \n Historically, men could always walk away, condemn the woman as a slut, say that the child wasn't his and his word was always valued more than that of the woman.\n \n I must bring up the recent scandal involving Mary Kay LeTourneau, she served a sentence for rape because of her sexual involvement with one of her minor students--she married the student when he came of age, after he had fathered two of their children out of wedlock.\n \n There was an earlier scandal in her family, she was the child of noted rightwing conservative Republican Roman Catholic ex-Congressman John Schmitz, an elegant chap with a clipped mustache and two illegitimate children.\n \n In the tenor of those times, a woman was either a slut or a virgin or a chaste mother of many children whose paternity were assured, John Schmitz disavowed his illegitimate children and their mother, who was constantly ill because of diabetes, was their sole support. When she was accused of child abuse, the whole sordid history of Schmitz' involvement was revealed. She died because of her illness and the children became orphans--even though they were not really--and wards of the state.\n \n So much for Republican family values! Ptah!",

   "Ok, so men have to pay child support. If a man chooses not to pay support and the government finds him he gets his wages garnished for the current support as well as the support he should have been paying. I think a man should be allowed to opt out of this. Simply put, if the man chooses not to be a part of his child's life at all he should also be allowed to opt out financially. My husband had a child before we were married. Even though she cheated on him the entire time she was pregnant he still supported her through the pregnancy and took care of her medical bills. He now pays child support every month which leaves him with less money to support his three children he had with me. We know from friends that she is using the child support money to buy marijuana and alcohol and her parents are basically supporting both her and the boy. They are refusing to allow my husband to even see his son. The courts won't help until he gets an attorney (which we can't afford). So, now he's taking money from the three children for whom he is the sole supporter so that it can go to get his first son's mother high and drunk, and no matter how much he wants to be a part of his son's life he is not allowed. Finally, she has sent him the message that if he tries to become a part of his son's life she will move and disappear. Only her parents will know where she is so they can send her the child support checks, and since they do anything she asks them to they would never tell anyone where she is. So, why does my husband have to pay this money? Also, a man should have the choice to raise the child. I saw on this thread the comment that a woman would them have to go through the pregnancy and birth and still haveto pay child support, but that's a lie. Unless the father receives state assistance (money not child care, medical, or food stamps) he can choose not to ask her for child support. The same goes for the woman, but I have never heard of a woman not going after the guy for child support.",

I would like to say that all men should have the opportunity to reject their fatherhood responsibilities until, say, the end of the fourth month (thus leaving time for the woman to have a safe abortion before the third trimester). In that case, if they reject fatherhood responsibilities, then they can never again claim fatherhood rights (custody, etc.) if that fetus is taken to term and becomes a child, without specific permission from the mother. \n \n The reason I have mixed feelings is that there are a large number of women whose belief system makes it impossible for them psychologically to have an abortion, in which case, she would essentially feel as if she has no choice, while the father would still have a choice - an unfair inbalance.

   "mental existence varies and has no set definition. Does one have to know they exist to have mental existence? Is mental existence only limited to humans? I always enjoy your thoughts on this Another Opinion :)\n \n existing outside a womb is not a human only trait. A cat can live outside a womb. You could say human womb but you still come back to the qualifier being \"human\" which is the one unique aspect which differs us from everything else.\n \n\n To answer a few of these questions:No, one does not have to know one exists to have a mental existence. As I had mentioned in our previous discussions, I take the minimalist view of a mind in that it need not even be conscious, just present in terms of the first hints of thoughts of any sort - i.e. mental activity - as indicated by the start of those organized brain patterns. That means that even severely mentally handicapped people still have that rudimentary mind, as do Alzheimer's patients, as do almost all people in comas (unless there are people whose bodies are being artificially kept alive once their minds are long gone). Mental existence is not limited to humans, but I guess I can be called prejudiced by favoring the rights of humans over those of animals. \n \n Animal, or generally non-human, rights can be an interesting discussion, though. I would like to grant animals some more rights than they currently have (i.e. through animal cruelty laws) - especially those animals that are capable of fealing fear, pain and mentally suffering. In the future, one might imagine the possibility of human-animal hybrids. I hear that there is a company trying to patent a human-chimp hybrid in order to get that discussion going. Anyway, these type of challenges to our system of morality are quite interesting. How should we treat the general question of rights of sensient species? Where should one draw the line? For example, is mass killing of pest species such as rats immoral? Should rights be determined on an individual basis or on a species basis? For ex., should a super-intelligent chimp get the same rights as an extremely mentally incapacitated human or should it be grouped with all chimps as all having lower rights? Interesting questions to ponder. We almost never think about animal rights - including myself. Perhaps we should. What are your views on animal rights?\n \n But one has to be human for this \"right\" to exist. You wouldn't say a being with non-human DNA and is alive and have minimal functionality of the mind has a right to life. The one consistent 100% unique trait is being \"human\". Human with __________ is a series of traits but they all need the \"human\" part.\n\n Being \"human\" is only one of the critical conditions that we currently set for giving the right to life. However, it is not a sufficient condition, as shown by the fact that, once brain activity sufficiently stops, we can automatically pull the plug, and by the fact that zygotes are not automatically given a right to life. For me, and for many others, the issue of an existence of a mind is critically important. Why do you think people hesitate in pulling the plug on a loved one who has lost all higher brain function? I know that the only reason that I would be hesitant is in holding on to desperate hopes that that person could still recover or that that person is still present mentally - i.e. delusions that would have no basis in reality.",

People under X IQ should be killed. How is that ranking any different in reasoning?\n\n You are acting as if the criteria that I choose of the beginnings of a mental existence is a random criteria. I could just as easily say that you rank humans based on the random criteria of having a complete set of DNA - sperm and eggs, after all, are also human. In both our cases, we have specific reasons for those criteria. You can challenge those reasons but to say that the criteria is arbitrary is an illogical statement.\n \n Any criteria one sets has to have a logical basis behind it. In the past, and still, in some isolated areas, in the present, there was significant discrimination against minority races and women. However, this discrimination was based on false assumptions which were easily disproven as soon as people bothered to look. An assumption was made that women and minorities were incapable of directing their own lives, that they were helpless, ignorant and required supervision. Reality, once they bothered to look, proved otherwise. However, that assumption is true in reality for actual young children, which is why children do not have the same rights as adults. Where IQ is concerned, then I can't think of too many areas where IQ would be a requirement for rights, unless it was so very low that, as with young children, they would be incapable of taking care of themselves. Bottom line - if there are no sound reasons behind excluding someone from rights, then that exclusion can be called arbitrary. However, when there are sound reasons (as in limiting the rights of small children), then that exclusion is not arbitrary.\n \n I don't think mental existence is important but the fact that a mental existence is developing should concern you as one that lost mental existence at age 40 but could get it back in 9 months would not be killed. \n\n If I understand you correctly, you are suggesting a hypothetical situation of a 40 year old that lost all mental existence (no higher brain function - i.e. no thoughts or emotions) but could get it back in 9 months. Since that is not a real situation, it never has to be faced, but I will take it on anyway. During the period of disappearance of mental existence, the 40 year old would go back to being a \"potential\" person, with a twist. The twist would be that they ALREADY existed, which bears much more weight, in my view, than the potential personhood of one who never existed. After all, all eggs and sperm could become people if they were only matched with the second set of DNA. Basically, my view is:\n 1) Eggs and Sperm: Potential people which need a critical step to even get started in growth into a real person.\n 2) Early fetus: Potential people who have started the growth process into real people.\n 3) Roughly third trimester fetus to end of mental existence: Real people\n 4) That 40 year old in temporary non-mental-existence: Potential person who already was a real person.\n \n So, following the general rule of \"do unto others...\", I think that the potential person who already existed should have higher consideration thatn a potential person who never yet existed but lower than a real person. So, if that 40 year old's continued existence would adversely affect a real person, who didn't agree to sustain that 40 year old, then that 40 year old in mental non-existence forfeits their life. If no one is hurt by their continued existence, then, by all means, continue that life. Note that most pro-choice people would agree that if the non-mentally-existing early fetus is not adversely affecting any real person's life (in most cases, the mother), then no one I know is advocating for killing it.",

I was under the assumption that we were using the \"human\" definition provided by the dictionary....but assumptions always get us in trouble :p\n\n Definitions are tricky since they carry connotations. In scientific usage, someone being \"a human\" simply means being alive with a particular set of human DNA - a dry, emotionless definition with no connotations. Imagine trying to draw sympathy by referring to people as \"living bodies with human DNA\". In common useage, human being, wherever I have heard it used, implies not just a body but a mental being as well. It is that connotation of mental being that draws sympathy to the term \"human being\". We do not sympathize with mere bodies. From the common useage point of view, then, an early fetus is not a \"human being\" since it does not yet have a mental existence. As for what is \"human\" - all the cells in our body are \"human\".

I think we probably agree this is not a good thing to do but it has a rational basis and would not be arbitrary.\n\n Someone could make that arguement and there have been societies that have implemented that (Naziism comes to mind) but a very compelling arguement could be made against such actions that appeals to our human sense of compassion and the general moral principles that guide most people in not mistreating others in a way that we would not want/expect to be mistreated. The counter-arguement is based on reason as well and the society would have to decide which one wins out. Since compassion is a strong driving force in people, the society would have to be conditioned against compassion to allow such a rule to be introduced. Where abortion of early fetuses is concerned, where there is no mental existence, your appeal to that human compassion is false since there is no \"someone\" present yet for whom one can have compassion. The pro-life side simply lacks any compelling arguement against aborting early fetuses without resorting to distortions.\n \n Ok, but that once again is just a thought not based on much. I don't understand by \"was a person\" really matters...what difference does it make? Would it change if the person that \"emerges\" 9 months later is different (as in their memory was erased and they are almost starting over)?\n\n The bottom line for me is the general moral code of treating others as you would be treated. I am glad that I was given a chance to be born but that does not mean that I think my mother should have had no other choice but to bear me, or that I think that they could not have used contraceptives, etc. Before I started to exist mentally, my body was just a thing with no rights. I don't think I deserved rights until after I started to mentally exist. I view all others the same way. If, in your 40-year old scenario, I existed and was going to go into temporary mental non-existence, then I would have no right to expect anyone to suffer to maintain me. If no-one would suffer to maintain me, then I would hope that I would be kept alive in that situation.",

As with food animals, we often don't think about those things that would make us uncomfortable since, if we really got a chance to follow the life of a particular chicken and see its emotions, we might feel too guilty to eat it. People who owned slaves in the past probably didn't care to consider the emotions or capabilities of those they were oppressing. I hear that even someone as awful as Hitler got very uncomfortable and angry when a woman in one of his dinner parties started speaking of the hardships that the Jews were facing under his programs.

I can't explain why compassion or emotion exists unless you wish to get into a supernatural argument.\n\n A mental existence seems necessary from the very definition of the word \"compassion\". The Merriam-Webster on-line dictionary's definition of compassion is \"sympathetic consciousness of others' distress together with a desire to alleviate it\" (from http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/compassion). Perhaps you might be confusing the emotion of \"compassion\" with simply having any emotions toward someone/something. I can certainly have strong attachments to favorite personal items and don't want them destroyed, but that does not mean I have compassion for them. Where compassion toward the dead is concerned, then either one believes that the mental existence of the dead continues in some version of an afterlife and one has actual compassion because you think that the soul of that person would be dismayed at, say, someone disrupting their grave. Otherwise, it is a respect for the memory and wishes of that person who you knew and loved. Part of that is the idea that you wouldn't want your grave disrupted since it affects people's future memory of you and you want people to remember you well so you respect the wishes of the dead person in promoting a good memory of them.\n \n Because mental existence may not be the standard by which rights are given.

I dont' really know what playing field we are working with here. I suppose that if God came down and this was the only thing God as every truely said to man then it really wouldn't matter whether you killed the fetus or not.

On the other hand a fetus, with all the parts acting as one, communicating with other parts, has a full expectation of development, and is on the opposite end of the \"brain dead\" adult with no expectation of recovery.\n \n In another one of your post, you said you don't mind abortions in the 3rd trimester, as you say its all mental perception that makes us human beings, and if that is your stance, then I want pro-choicers, who like you believe in this ideology to argue with your own kind (the pro-choice side) and demand a more structured deadline when abortion is no longer humane.\n \n Tell me, about the article below. Do you believe the article, or are they a bunch of quacks. If you believe them, then it is apparent to them that pain exist well in the second trimester. If you are a person of your word and you believe what you say, then doesn't it offend YOU, knowing that our unborn children in the second and third trimester feel pain their last moments of their life? \n \n Why don't you question the pro-choice side? Ask them why the pro-choice movement arbitrarily picked the 24th week? \n \n Ask the pro-choice side, what deadly condition is there, where it endangers the life of the mother, after the 24th weeks where a fetus has to be dismembered as opposed to taken out whole and alive?\n \n So if you are a responsible pro-choicers, you shouldn't sit silently by and let the pro-choice movement literally get away with murder, and kill another human being, in the second or third trimester. Make a fuss, and demand real answers from the pro-choice side.\n \n Also, let us not forget, our knowledge is only as good as our technology. With great certainty, we now believe pain can be detected in the 2nd trimester, however that doesn't say pain or fear doesn't happen in the 1st trimester, but until we have better studies and technology, we have what we have.\n \n So until more technology comes along, I request that responsible pro-choicers like yourself demand logical answers from your pro-choice movement that actually makes sense and is consistent.\n \n So, I apologize for the long post, however, the most important answer I want from you is that link to a neurological society stating terminating the living existance of human life is not the killing of a living human life.\n \n Thanks.\n \n \n http://www.iasp-pain.org/PCU06-2.pdf",

   "Well you speak of the dead and maybe one could believe that the fetus has a soul long before they have what you might call a mental existence (this actually is something I believe so feel free to use it against me :p). I think to say one has to suffer in order to have compassion is rather misleading (not that you said this). I could give examples of this but I'll wait to see if you want them :) or if I am misreading you.\n\n Well, the dictionary definition spoke of \"distress\" of the other being to whom one has compassion. It does not have to be a heavy strong suffering, it may be a lighter psychological issue that they are dealing with - i.e. there are many levels of \"distress\" but that word \"distress\" automaticall assumes a mental existence. There are times where we may anthropomorphise and think a thing is feeling distress when it can't possibly, but that is another matter. I would indeed be curious, what examples would you give for compassion for something that has no mental existence?\n \n And this is the basic issue. I may have asked you this before but if the unborn has a mental existence at 3 days would you still feel the argument by pro-choicers of \"letting the women choose because her body is more important \" is valid? In other words, does what a women want with her body trump a right to life?\n\n This has come up in our previous discussions and my answer is pretty much the same. I would then restrict very early abortions as well (minus the usual exceptions of woman's life, rape, insect, etc.) but very strongly support development of a universal contraceptive program, tube tying, etc. that all would have access to and afford (or have it donated) - everything possible to prevent the unwanted pregnancies to begin with. For example, I would support automatically giving all teenage girls long term contraceptives (ex. the patch kind) unless they openly refuse it. However, I must note that now I am erring on the side of fetal rights in saying that the limit should be placed at the beginning of the third trimester since that is when a mind MIGHT first start existing. If new research would point to the mind existing very early on (highly unlikely but we are arguing hypotheticals), then I no longer would be that generous and would require strong evidence of such existence of the early fetal mind before I would support restricting abortion accordingly.\n \n Thats a tough little scenario. I dont' really know what playing field we are working with here. I suppose that if God came down and this was the only thing God as every truely said to man then it really wouldn't matter whether you killed the fetus or not. If we apply the rules of the Bible then I don't think you could.\n\n I wonder, then, if there is a sense of obligation to God or a sense of guilt that factors into all of this. Namely, if God came down and said that abortion of first trimester fetus's was ok, then would that change the minds of most pro-life people? \n \nOn a side note....i really hope people read this and take notes on how to do a \"civil debate\"...you really are one of the only people I have debated on here that doesn't resort to cheap tactics.\n\n I continue to hope that even people who flame can eventually be turned into having a civil discussion if one continues to respond calmly, respectfully, and addresses their points rationally but without insult or incrimination. Some may never be calmed, but I think it is often worth a try.",

   "Please direct me to a competent neurological society that has stated in so many words, the termination of a living human being's life, isn't the killing of a living human being's life until the living human being reaches the stage of ???.\n\n You are missing the point of what I am saying. Yes, the early fetus is a human life and if you kill it you are killing a human life. That is not what is significant to me. The thing that is significant to me is whether or not you are killing a human being with a mind/soul since those are the ones that I can have sympathy for - I do not have sympathy to mere bodies. The neurological view is only one that states that that mind cannot start to exist before the third trimester.\n \nOn the \"brain dead\" adult/child position, the adult/child, being held alive by machine, has no EXPECTATION of returning to what the person was and really is a collection of \"parts\" so to speak, parts not communicatiing with the others. On the other hand a fetus, with all the parts acting as one, communicating with other parts, has a full expectation of development, and is on the opposite end of the \"brain dead\" adult with no expectation of recovery.\n\n As I've said in other threads, I appreciate the fact that the fetus has the *potential* of becoming a real person with a mental existence and I would hope that women considering abortion would take that potential into consideration since I think it does deserve some respect. However, a *potential* person is certainly not yet a real person so I do not view that any hypothetical rights of a potential person should supercede those of a real personl. After all, eggs are also potential people that simply need more steps to even start the growth process. \n \nIn another one of your post, you said you don't mind abortions in the 3rd trimester, as you say its all mental perception that makes us human beings, and if that is your stance, then I want pro-choicers, who like you believe in this ideology to argue with your own kind (the pro-choice side) and demand a more structured deadline when abortion is no longer humane.\n\n Assuming that,in this last paragraph, you meant to say that I do mind abortions in the 3rd trimester (since I have consistently stated that I do), then Roe vs. Wade already allows states to limit abortions in the third trimester so there is no need to overturn it or other legislation to allow for such restrictions. Indeed, as of April 2006, 36 states had bans on late-term abortions that were not facially unconstitutional (i.e. banning all abortions) or enjoined by court order. (fact from Wikipedia.com).\n \n In older posts, I have had discussions with people on the pro-choice side who would keep third trimester abortions completely open out of fear of the slippery slope. I have not had those discussions recently since no one on the pro-choice side has challenged my stance of restricted third-trimester abortions. It should be noted that, from polls I have seen, it seems that even most pro-choice people would restrict abortion in the third trimester.\n \nTell me, about the article below. Do you believe the article, or are they a bunch of quacks. If you believe them, then it is apparent to them that pain exist well in the second trimester. If you are a person of your word and you believe what you say, then doesn't it offend YOU, knowing that our unborn children in the second and third trimester feel pain their last moments of their life? \n\n The pain receptors are there in the second trimester but it doesn't register as suffering until later in the pregnancy - there are different levels of brain development necessary to fully register pain. For example, if you accidentally touch a hot grill, you will react to that heat before you feel the pain of it. That initial reaction is governed by a lower level of brain and reacts faster. The feeling of pain registers in higher levels of the brain. Those levels are not yet developed enough in a second trimester fetus, from what I have read.\n \nAsk the pro-choice side, what deadly condition is there, where it endangers the life of the mother, after the 24th weeks where a fetus has to be dismembered as opposed to taken out whole and alive?\n\n I would hope that any necessary third trimester abortion (ex. to save the life of the mother) would be done as humanely as possible. To answer your question, I don't know of any such condition but neither am I familiar with this procedure and why people choose it. That is a side issue to the main issue of whether abortions should be allowed in the first and second trimester.\n \nSo if you are a responsible pro-choicers, you shouldn't sit silently by and let the pro-choice movement literally get away with murder, and kill another human being, in the second or third trimester. Make a fuss, and demand real answers from the pro-choice side.\n\n I don't have an issue with the second trimester and Roe vs. Wade already allows restrictions on abortion in the third trimester so there is not much to argue there. Only about 1% of abortions are performed in the third trimester anyway, and most of those are for the generally accepted reasons of being a threat to the mother's life. Lastly, when an earlier poster did once suggest that third trimester abortions should not be restricted, I did indeed argue against that.",

This is just the abstract, but there is access to the full-text article online at pubmed. \n \n It addresses the issue of pain at something that is perceived in the human cortex; there is no way to understand the quality or content of a \"thought\", of course.\n \n \n \n Lee SJ, Ralston HJP, Drey EA, Partridge JC, Rosen MA. Fetal Pain: A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence. JAMA, 2005; 294(8): 947-54.\n \n \n \n \nContext\n Proposed federal legislation would require physicians to inform women\n seeking abortions at 20 or more weeks after fertilization that the fetus feels pain and to offer anesthesia administered directly to the fetus. This article examines whether a fetus feels pain and if so, whether safe and effective techniques exist for providing direct fetal anesthesia or analgesia in the context of therapeutic procedures or abortion.\n \n Evidence Acquisition \n Systematic search of PubMed for English-language articles focusing on human studies related to fetal pain, anesthesia, and analgesia. Included articles studied fetuses of less than 30 weeks' gestational age or specifically addressed fetal pain perception or nociception. Articles were reviewed for additional references. The search was performed without date limitations and was current as of June 6, 2005.\n \n Evidence Synthesis \n Pain perception requires conscious recognition or awareness of a noxious stimulus. Neither withdrawal reflexes nor hormonal stress responses to invasive procedures prove the existence of fetal pain, because they can be elicited by nonpainful stimuli and occur without conscious cortical processing. Fetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections. Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23 to 30 weeks' gestational age, while electroencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks. For fetal surgery, women may receive general anesthesia and/or analgesics intended for placental transfer, and parenteral opioids may be administered to the fetus under direct or sonographic visualization. In these circumstances, administration of anesthesia and analgesia serves purposes unrelated to reduction of fetal pain, including inhibition of fetal movement, prevention of fetal hormonal stress responses, and induction of uterine atony.\n \n Conclusions \n Evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester. Little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques. Similarly, limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion. Anesthetic techniques currently used during fetal surgery are not directly applicable to abortion procedures.\n",

So therefore, the questions is should we err on the side of caution or should we throw caution to the wind.\n \n Throughout history certain people in this world believed they can kill life without pause, and did so, then the \"civilized and educated\" came along and empowered women to kill their own unborn babies, and women do so, but it's not for the lack of understanding when life begins, but masking the real unknown; the unknow in how to make women equal. Equal in society where they don't have to rely on a man to support herself and child. The unknown on how to make men share in the living standard a woman will live raising her child.\n \n To this day (in NY), all a man has to give a woman for child support is 17% of his gross salary. Let's do the math shall we. A man's gross salary is $100,000 so all he has to give to support his child is 17,000. Hmmm, rent, food, daycare all for $17,000. Can you see the BALANCE HERE 17% her to 83% HIM. I see the root of the UNKNOW, its called equality for women.\n \n Pro-choicers undermine the women's movement, they undermine women's equality, they undermine women's intelligence, and perhaps the most important thing they undermine is the essence of the woman herself; her kind, nurturing nature. We've turned moms against their babies and we've turned women into takers instead of givers. Why? Why, because its not that we don't know when life begins, that's just a smoke screen. Why? Why, because, women don't stand a chance of raising her own child because the odds are financially stacked against her. Remember the 17% to 83% imbalance, well, isn't this the ROOT of why women kill their own babies.\n \n Pro-choicers, if you really love women, like I do. Then stand up for them. Demand women get more financial support. Let's turn the table on men, let's make the balance 83% for women and 17% for men, and see how long that last.

(if this doesn't make sense right now then please say so..I'm a little exhausted haha)\n\n I might feel compassion for a favorite tree when it would be threatened with being cut down, but when I analyze why I would feel compassion, I would have to admit that I was anthropomorphising it (this is my favorite word for the day :) ). I suspect that, in your compassion for the tree, you would be anthropomorphising it also. All the other examples you gave dealt with real people. One can have compassion for someone who is long dead by imagining what they must have felt or wanted. As for your point about the prostitute, if she actually enjoyed that profession, then any compassion I would feel is in thinking that she may not know what she is missing by having a more normal profession and relationship and she may not know what dangers she is facing. I guess it is a compassion for what she will likely face in the future. For someone with religious views about her bad fate in an afterlife, they might have compassion because she will meet that bad fate. Either way, it clearly is a mentally existing being one is having compassion for.\n \n I thought you did. Sorry for asking again \n\n Well, I did elaborate more in this response than in the original response and the question did set me to thinking more about the issue. It brought up an interesting point, though. Namely, how is the pro-life camp split in terms of distributing contraception? After all, if something like my idea of automatically giving teenage girls patch-type contraceptives were implemented then there would be far fewer unwanted teenage pregnancies and, therefore, also fewer abortions. If contraceptives were cheap, easy to get, and strongly advertised and pushed in large segments of society, then one could imagine that the number of abortions could be reduced substantially. I know that there are people in the religious right that are against contraceptive use and certainly against its free distribution. Is the pro-life camp split on this or is such a split avoided by not taking any stance on the issue? I simply think that that would be a great way to approach the ultimate goal of eliminating abortions.\n \n I'm sure many pro-lifers base their moral beliefs on a God. This is not wrong as everyone has to have some basis for a belief system (even if it is themself). Guilt is a bad term though...although some might feel that way for guilt. I think that a love or respect for God is why one should obey His wishes. If God said \"1st trimester abortions are ok\" then I think everyone would agree with that...unless only a few saw God haha.\n\n I guess I can understand that people might hold that view. In some ways, it might be a more comfortable view to take - letting ones religious beliefs dictate ones moral positions is in some ways easier than forcing oneself to think through all moral questions in terms of reprecussions, etc. For myself and my wavering religious views (varying between agnosticism and some version of Christianity), if there is a God, I would view Him as more of a teacher or a parent sending His children out into the world. I would hope that a parent would want its child to have a moral system based on sound, well thought out moral judgements - not just because Mom or Dad told them so. \n \nI think we have hit the main and only root of the abortion debate. To me, all arguments about \"women rights\" or whatever are almost irrelevant and hold no water when you get to the main issue of when a human is worth not killing.

In the case of abortion, one has a scale where, on one side are the fetal rights and on the other side are the mother's rights. What one places on either side and which rights win out depends on one's beliefs and priorities. As you say, some prioritize \"mental existence\", others independence, others the fact that it is a human life and will develop into us, etc. For example, even most pro-life people seem to wrestle with the moral dilema of whether to allow abortions in the case of rape or incest. It isn't always cut and dry.",

   "Well, I did elaborate more in this response than in the original response and the question did set me to thinking more about the issue. It brought up an interesting point, though. Namely, how is the pro-life camp split in terms of distributing contraception? After all, if something like my idea of automatically giving teenage girls patch-type contraceptives were implemented then there would be far fewer unwanted teenage pregnancies and, therefore, also fewer abortions. If contraceptives were cheap, easy to get, and strongly advertised and pushed in large segments of society, then one could imagine that the number of abortions could be reduced substantially. I know that there are people in the religious right that are against contraceptive use and certainly against its free distribution. Is the pro-life camp split on this or is such a split avoided by not taking any stance on the issue? I simply think that that would be a great way to approach the ultimate goal of eliminating abortions.\n Well, like many things, abortion is not the only issue on which someone has a stance. I wouldn't say pro-lifers are \"split\" because there is fairly universal belief that a right to life begins right away...with some varying thoughts. Pro-choice has a wider spectrum (not that this is bad) with some going by the trimester system, some going by birth, some just go my mothers whim, some by mental existence...etc. This is the issue of abortion. Contraception, while related to abortion, may get into a different belief altogether for someone. So I don't think you can really relate the two issues anymore then saying their is a split in pro-life with who likes ham and who likes chicken.",

   "Come on people, let's stop dodging the real answer why abortion exist. Remember those statistic people keep talking about 90% happen in the 1st trimester, well that's only half the story, they forgot to tell you that most abortion happen to women who are young, under-educated, with financial instability. So pro-choicers be proud of your misleading logo. It's not about choice. Abortion forces women to have one or suffer the financial consequences. Yeah, real choice!\n \n I wonder if our government paid $75,000.00 for every baby born, even if its adopted, that they would give that money to the birth mom. I wonder if abortion's would decrease. Ummm, yeah.\n \n See, we know it's not george in the womb we care about, but george in the pocket that has greater weight than life itself.\n\n I'm not sure what your point is here. Are you actually blaming people who are pro-choice for the grissly lot of very poor women who choose abortion because they cannot afford to have a child? That is quite suprising given that it is the Democratic party (largely pro-choice) that is the one most supportive of social programs along the lines of what you suggest and the Republican party (largely pro-life) who limits aid to such women (all of those accusations of \"tax and spend\" liberals come to mind). Otherwise, are you blaming the poor women for choosing abortion because they cannot afford to have a child and you discount that as a reason? Please make your point more clearly.",

So I don't think you can really relate the two issues anymore then saying their is a split in pro-life with who likes ham and who likes chicken.\n\n What are the views of most pro-life people, then, when it comes to birth control? Are there differences of opinion about different methods of birth control - ex. biochemical methods that prevent an already fertilized egg from attaching itself and therefore stop its continued growth, vs. simple condoms that help prevent the fertilization to begin with? From what I've heard, even those with most far-right views at least advocate abstinence or for married couples to limit sex during fertile parts of the monthly cycle, but I have heard that even a simple ancient method such as coitus interruptus is objected to by certain people on the far-right. Do you know the range of reasons behind the range of views among pro-life people (a group that does generally does overlap strongly with the anti-birth-control group)?\n \n I know that this is slightly off topic, but I suspect that the views about contraception are related to those about abortion and do shed more light on the overall picture.\n \n I also wonder if another moral issue gets mixed in with the pro-life stance on abortion and birth control and that is the moral issue of sexual promiscuity. Women who suffer rape or incest obviously cannot be blamed for those sexual acts, which is why it seems the pro-life people have much more sympathy and often allow exceptions for abortions. What are your views on this issue?",

Pain Clinical Update looks like some free throwaway. It is not even listed in the Journal Citation Index. It is not peer reviewed, and the article was an editorial, the opinion of a single author. At least it was not a pro-life source. My source was JAMA, but more importantly it was a systematic review of the literature, a specialized and rigourous method to review a certain topic.\n \n 2. Nontheless, addressing the article on its content's merit, the thrust of the article, is on the last page when it attempts to critique recent reviews. His argument rests on the idea that 1. it views the physiology of pain in a more modern paradigm,[but that really gives no insight into this topic] 2. that the fetal neurophysiology may not be like an adult [it well may be, but no one knows, and 3. that pain is perceived in sub-cortical regions, i.e. the thalamus [which is what the review I looked specifically addressed.]\n \n This article cites not a single piece of direct empirical evidence, but bases its conclusion on a different, theoretical point of view that as yet has not been tested. It's conclusion is, \"These subcortical structures, which develop much\n earlier than the cortex, may play a pivotal role in sensory perception.\"\n \n I still stand by my original position. \n \n I believe I am keeping an open mind here.

   "To this day (in NY), all a man has to give a woman for child support is 17% of his gross salary. Let's do the math shall we. A man's gross salary is $100,000 so all he has to give to support his child is 17,000. Hmmm, rent, food, daycare all for $17,000. Can you see the BALANCE HERE 17% her to 83% HIM. I see the root of the UNKNOW, its called equality for women.\n\n \n Ok, firstly no woman should expect to be able to raise a child on 17% of the father's gross income without also working herself (and if she isn't working then what does she need child care for?). If she can and she wants to, fine, but how does it promote equality for the father to have to support the baby AND the mother 100%? \n \n Second, I find the figure to be very fair, as the mother is expected to contribute to the costs of raising a child also, and were the child not in the picture the mother would have to at least support herself and thus have many of the same expenses anyway. I say this as a single mother who does recieve child support too. My daughter stays with her dad for three months during the summer, and during those three months my expenses do not really go down all that much. My daughter's father may have an obligation to pay for half of her support, but he's under no obligation to pay for MY support too. \n \n Third, if a woman finds the task of raising a child on this amount of child support to be burdensome, she can always award primary or full custody to the father. There's no reason the woman has to be the custodial parent.",

Men should be able to use them too. There could be many different types of pre-consumate agreements, and they could be as many and varied as pre-nuptual agreements. Either a man or a women could decide exactly what it is they would want in the event of a pregnancy and could even carry around a \"standard form\" to be agreed to by anyone they sleep with if they wanted. There would still be some issues that come up regarding the enforcability of the document from time to time, but at least no-one would have the excuse of not knowing what they were getting into beforehand, and no one would be able to lie about their intentions before the fact then \"change their mind\" later on. \n \n As far as putting time limits on opting out of parenthood, I think it would have to be before the end of the first trimester, as those are both the safest and the least expensive abortions. The problem with that though is that all a woman would have to do is hide the fact she is pregnant from the man until after the cut-off. That's why I think it would have to be decided on a case by case basis. Certain things would need to be taken into account such as whether or not there was any deception on the part of either party, how long the pregnancy has been known about by either party, whether or not there was a verbal agreement beforehand, whether they are married and if so whether they are currently seeking divorce, etc.",
