   "Scientific Integrity in Policy Making: Further investigation of the Bush administration's abuse of science investigates several new incidents that have surfaced since the February 2004 UCS report. These new incidents have been corroborated through in-depth interviews and internal government documents, including some documents released through the Freedom of Information Act. The cases that follow include:\n \n -egregious disregard of scientific study, across several agencies, regarding the environmental impacts of mountaintop removal mining; \n -censorship and distortion of scientific analysis, and manipulation of the scientific process, across several issues and agencies in regard to the Endangered Species Act; \n -distortion of scientific knowledge in decisions about emergency contraception; \n -new evidence about the use of political litmus tests for scientific advisory panel appointees. These new revelations put to rest any arguments offered by the administration that the cases to date have been isolated incidents involving a few bad actors. \n \n Concern in the scientific community has continued to grow. In the months since the original UCS report, more than 4,000 scientists have signed onto the scientists' statement. Signers include 48 Nobel laureates, 62 National Medal of Science recipients, and 127 members of the National Academy of Sciences. A number of these scientists have served in multiple administrations, both Democratic and Republican, underscoring the unprecedented nature of this administration's practices and demonstrating that the issues of scientific integrity transcend partisan politics.\n \n http://www.ucsusa.org/global_environment/rsi/page.cfm?pageID=1449\n \n Does this suprise anyone?",

   "Thanks for this one. I have been saying for a number of years that GWB is a scientific illiterate. He was actually governor of my state (shudder). He has surrounded himself with like minded advisors and affected the policies of government agencies. The problem is that he knows the answers before he even listens to scientific advice - thus he is able to reject the opinions of respected scientists because his faith overrides reality.\n \n My country has reached a low point. But I fear that we have not hit bottom. Fundamentalist creationists will continue to drag us down until the U.S. has the scientific stature of Afghanistan or Angola. At that point the fundamentalist creationists will continue to blame blame science for the wrath of their god.",

   "i don't think you understand the point of this thread. I suggest you read the first post's article before contiuning in this thread.\n\n \n I understand that much of science and almost all of environmentalism, is not sought out by free markets. Like a private sector employee who seeks a raise, or a company owner who seeks to expand, they also seek to grow their public funds. When a president \"disregards their scientific study\" (doing instead, silly little things like trying to stop terrorist attacks) it tends to make wastefull domestic spending a little more questionable.\n \n Not only did I read the first post's article, I read Mr. Kelly's resignation letter. I was wondering if he was seeking a real job for a change. Unfortunately, he said \"now is the time to resign and seek a more satifying and productive way to help protect fish and their habitats\". Not much chance of a private sector job there - unless his interest in fish was more along the lines of providing fish to EAT, rather than protect.\n \n Those who live on tax & spend programs, don't have a hard time critisizing Republican presidents.",
