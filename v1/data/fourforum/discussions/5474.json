   "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - First lady Laura Bush would defeat U.S. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton if the two were to face each other in the 2008 presidential contest, Vice President Dick Cheney said on Monday. \n \n Cheney made the prediction after his wife, Lynne Cheney, suggested the matchup in an interview on CNN's \"Larry King Live.\"\n \n Mrs. Cheney noted the rampant speculation that the former first lady, now a senator from New York, would make a bid in the next presidential go-around. LINK\n\n Highly unlikely. I think the only woman that would stand a chance against Hillary would be Condi.",

   "Hillary would be my feminist icon if she had divorced her zipper challenged hubbie while he was playing a new game in the White House, \"swallow the leader.\" She didn't, which only confirmed that there marriage is only about political expediency. \n \n Laura Bush has more balls the Gee Dubya. She is also surprisingly well intentioned in contrast to her hubbie. A stand in substitute of Condi? She was the PR person for the weapons of mass destruction lie.\n \n But then there is Jeb Bush. Is there a Clinton brother somewhere that could be used?\n \n If we end up with Jeb vs Hillary, it underscores that both parties are bankrupt of new faces, ideas and OUTSIDERS.",
