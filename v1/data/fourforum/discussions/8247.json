They constantly project their lives and failures onto all of us (gay people).\n \n Did you ever notice that these so called 'Ex-Gays' always have the same life history....extreme promiscuity, extreme abuse of alcohol and drugs, history of prostitution, basically extreme addictive personality disorders. Well, they moved from those addictions to another....religion, and they'll take their new addiction to the extreme to. They also were social outcasts in the gay community because they were so unstable and nutty. The most important fact is, the only ex-gays they trot out are being paid by the ex-gay organizations....again, prostituting themselves just like they did earlier in their lives.\n \n To tell you the truth, I pity them. I disregard what they say because they are basically losers in life. And of course George Bush is going to use these people, they are exactly like him! He wasn't gay, but he did everything else these losers did, and he has the addictive personality disorder, just like them.\n \n I, and the rest of the gay people I know are nothing like these losers. Let the ex-gays go over to the dark side. They belong over there with the rest of the haters.",

In fact, now they aren't only hurting themselves with their addictions, they are now attacking and hurting innocent gay people.\n\n I think you hit a nail on the head.\n \n The anti-gay \"ex-gay\" crowd have stories that scream of \"addiction\". They were addicted to sex. They were addicted to drugs. They were addicted to alcohol.\n \n That is NOT the typical \"gay lifestyle\", but that is the only lifestyle that these addicts knew, so they claim it is the typical \"gay lifestyle\" that they needed to be rescued from.\n \n And the anti-gay religious right, which fuel the \"reparative therapy\" attempts, aren't honest enough to tell them the REAL problem.\n Gays DO exist that aren't addicted to sex or drugs or alcohol.\n Their problem IS NOT that they are gay. It's that they are addicts.\n \n The ADDICTED portion is what they need to change. Not the \"gay\".\n \n But a simple bait and switch, and the anti-gay \"reparative therapy\" crowd have what they want. A substituted addiction. Addicted to their cause.\n \n I think one of the most damning and obvious points in this whole craze is how they don't refer to themselves as \"straight\", but rather they refer to themselves as \"ex-gay\"...",
