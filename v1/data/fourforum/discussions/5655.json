   "Dean has embarrased himself and the democratic party with his comments. The real test is too see how much damage these statements cause. My guess is that not too many people really care what Dr. Dean thinks or says, which is why he did not make it in his party's primary. I think the majority of Americans closed their ears during the Dean scream, and few have started to listen to him yet. Even the majority of the republican party is just laughing at Dean, as they should be. It seems that the only people trying to get a whole lot of mileage out of Dean's inane comments are the media, and I think a lot of people (republican and democrat) have stopped listening to the media as well. \n \n I think the only thing this shows is the desperate nature of the democratic party if it elects someone like Dean as the party chair. The democrats need someone strong, well spoken, and moderate as the chair if they desire to be a true threat in the next election. Dean does not fit this role. The democratic party of the past has had some great and noble leaders. Dean will never be counted among them. \n \n Maybe this will help the American people to realize that it is time to start thinking for itself, and we will stop listening to the garbage that comes from radicals and media on both side of the fence. At least it's a start.",

   "1- Voters don't pay attention to the party chairs... Their job is to raise money and make sure the party works, and state chairmen love Dean because he is paying more attention to them than TM did. In fact, in this time of grassroots campaigns Dean understands that politicians need to hit the ground and retail... not wholesale their message to be effective. Dean is fulfilling his major promise... to \"show up\" in traditionally red states. Regardless of what you believe, at least he is keeping his campaign promises.\n \n 2- Howard Dean is not as crazy as you all think. In fact compared to Delay, your leader in the House, and this administration, he makes a lot of sense. now you can try and squawk about some things he says, but when it comes to the issues Republicans are as vacuous as a hot air balloon: looks pretty but light on substance. Statistic after statistic comes out that makes republicans look bad, what is their damage control... attack HDean. Do you think that they would admit they made a mistake, or try and work within our TWO PARTY SYSTEM... of course not, they will cry like babies for more power -- exemplars include packing the court and the 'nuclear option'. \n \n Face it, You parade Dean around to try and move the spotlight from your own spotty, disgusting, and filthy record of alleged human rights abuses, mass outsourcing of jobs-including interrogation, your close relationship with Saudi's, your lack of funding on NCLB, Hydrogen Car initiative, AID's in Africa, well the list goes on... in fact the only thing that you do fund is the military war machine... billions wasted in a failed action, but an administration too blind to admit or care. Let us shed the focus to where it should go:\n \n What are you going to do now that it was uncovered that the administration official in charge of vetting scientific evidence was hiding evidence of global warming in a sleazy attempt to protect his oil interests... will we acknowledge that Global Warming... or Global Change is occurring?\n \n What are you going to do about Gitmo? A magnet and terrorist creating tool. You say that our criticisms of this administration are creating terrorists? Your own policies are doing that job without anyone else saying a thing. Terrorist recruitment has been going up while U.S. Army and Marine recruitment has been going down. What is your response to this major defeat in the war on Terror?\n \n Speaking of which how can we afford (both fiscally, militarily, and politically) to stay in iraq when over 12,000 Iraqi's were killed, their standard of living is down the toilet, dozens of our soldiers are dying every week, and troops on the ground are commenting that the situation is getting worse... not better. General Myers even admitted that every terrorist attack in that country is claiming more and more lives. Even the Congressman who sponsored the change from \"french fries\" to \"freedom fries\" is pulling his support for the Iraqi war saying that we aught to develop and exit strategy and get out there. What is your reaction to that?\n \n Speaking of which, how is the hunt for Bin Laden going? Representative Hunter now suggests he may be in Libya, said on Meet the Press this past weekend that Bin Laden maybe traveling between Libya, Afghanistan, and Pakistan... what do you propose to do about that.\n \n You used WMD as a reason to go to war with Iraq, well Mr. KJI of North Korea and the Shahs of Iran have developed WMD's under Bush's watch, what made Iraq a more tempting target than Iran or North Korea? Are we going to back down to Kim and pay him off? Or stand up to him and help our allies in any way possible?\n \n You speak of family values, well lets talk of family values. Who supports a better minimum wage for mom and pop? Who supports better public schools for little timmy and tiny? Who wants to care for our seniors by making sure that there is a nest egg for them at home. Mr. Bush's record on domestic issues is tanking faster than the Titanic, 33% on SS--- what do you plan to do about that?\n \n Here is what the Administration's response, and what every right wing republican response has been. They plan to blame the 'liberal press', pretend that none of these problems exist, and try and grab more power in the Senate and completely neuter the opposition and bog them down. I ask you, what should take up more time, this administration's blatant failures- or a few poorly worded comments by a figurehead.",

Either way they will be poor...if you raise the minimum wage you just cause a shift...all the fast foods places charge more thus causing everyone to pay more and then their wages go up to pay for it (aka inflation). But who cares about economics when you can do something that sounds good...wait...weren't you complaining about that earlier? Better public schools, you actually have a point here. I think No Child Left Behind was garbage. SS, its a POS system that needs to be fixed. The president has idea whats the democrats......silence....\n \n \nSpeaking of which how can we afford (both fiscally, militarily, and politically) to stay in iraq when over 12,000 Iraqi's were killed, their standard of living is down the toilet, dozens of our soldiers are dying every week, and troops on the ground are commenting that the situation is getting worse... not better.

You think we just went into Japan and the next day everyone was having a party?\n \n \n \nwill we acknowledge that Global Warming... \n Until evidence is provided that there actually IS global warming then I will call it a bunch of BS. Considering we only have written temperatures and other data for 100 or so years it would be hard to say 1 million years ago what the temperature was.\n \n \n \n I suggest not reading things at face value and actually look into a situation. You seem to start with \"bush is no good so therefore ____\" then you will always say anythign he does is bad. However, I tend to take an idea...say social security...look into it, ask some people that would know (in this case some finance professors and accounting profs I know) and get the story. From this I concluded that the best solution would be to dissolve SS however, bushs plan aint that bad. Now, take No Child Left Behind. I did the same thing, asked some teachers I trusted from many states....I concluded that it was junk and this seems to be proving true now. So don't go by what Howard Dean says, he is nuts, go by real thinking.",

   "Listen, yes temperature does vary, yes global warming is going on without humans doing a thing. What we most likely ARE doing is speeding it up and making it worse. I mean after looking at the evidence I can't see how any rational individual would come to an contrary opinion.\n \n I don't know what it was like back then (5000 years ago), but Earth started as a fireball that then slowly cooled down. Since the atmosphere formed and the core stabilized the earth has been moving between ice ages and being uncomfortably hot. Weather is factored by many things, from caldera and flood-basalt volcanoes, to the greenhouse effect. We shouldn't view temperature as linear by any means. It is a dynamic system where we can only see broad trends that occur over time and then change after some point.\n \n At this time we are seeing a broad trend that points to global warming. The evidence is there, since we started keeping accurate records. As the above graph suggests this rate of warming is increasing faster and faster. \n \n \nLess death trends, infastructure going up, attacks down (trend).\n \n \n Incorrect, again as Myers said the other day, while attacks are down... MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING! Just today At least 22 individuals were killed. Infrastructure is also going down, as well as troop moral. Our soldiers \"own\" a road as long as they are on it. They are basically ants in a fortress, secure, but step out to go from fortress to fortress and they are in danger because they can't hold a road. And for you to brush off American troop moral is speaks volumns. These are the people who are putting their lives on the line. They are the key individuals out there for the war. They are dying... and you simply say \nbut whatever\n shows your own moral clarity... or lack thereof!",

   "Listen, yes temperature does vary, yes global warming is going on without humans doing a thing. What we most likely ARE doing is speeding it up and making it worse. I mean after looking at the evidence I can't see how any rational individual would come to an contrary opinion.\n \n I don't know what it was like back then (5000 years ago), but Earth started as a fireball that then slowly cooled down. Since the atmosphere formed and the core stabilized the earth has been moving between ice ages and being uncomfortably hot. Weather is factored by many things, from caldera and flood-basalt volcanoes, to the greenhouse effect. We shouldn't view temperature as linear by any means. It is a dynamic system where we can only see broad trends that occur over time and then change after some point.\n \n At this time we are seeing a broad trend that points to global warming. The evidence is there, since we started keeping accurate records. As the above graph suggests this rate of warming is increasing faster and faster. \n \n So how do you know this isn't just a normal trend of the Earth since you only have 120 so years of data? Which is no more then one data point on the graph of the history of earth. I will grant you that the earth is warming as the graph obviously shows...however, I have no reason to believe this is not a normal occurance of the earth that could very easily reverse in 100 years.\n \n \nIncorrect, again as Myers said the other day, while attacks are down... MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING! Just today At least 22 individuals were killed. Infrastructure is also going down, as well as troop moral. Our soldiers \"own\" a road as long as they are on it. They are basically ants in a fortress, secure, but step out to go from fortress to fortress and they are in danger because they can't hold a road. And for you to brush off American troop moral is speaks volumns. These are the people who are putting their lives on the line. They are the key individuals out there for the war. They are dying... and you simply say \n Can you show me where troop moral is going down? As for your other claims...I assume you have been to Iraq to witness this. And attacks are down..that is a good thing is it not?",

They have since shifted their targeting to essentially crowds of of unsuspecting civilains, because these are the easiest tragets to attack and then only ones they have the ability to attack any longer.\n \n In regards to troop morale, recruiting has slipped, however the army and marines are meeting their retention goals, which is a fairly good gauge of troop morale.
