   "If one wants to know a Christian fundamentalist, a good place to start is by looking at his associates and backers. Here's an analysis of a couple of close Huckabee associates:\n \n Huckabee's Christian Reconstructionist Ties Run Deep\n http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2008/01/06/1249\n \n It details some of the extremist views of two Dominionists who have had close ties to Huckabee, one even co-authoring a 1998 book with the candidate, Kids Who Kill: Confronting Our Culture of Violence. In this book, our dynamic duo compared homosexuality to pedophilia and necrophilia, among others, calling them \"institutionally supported aberrations.\" Huckabee's co-author even wrote in a 1993 book, Legislating Immorality: The Homosexual Movement Comes Out Of The Closet, that \"[t]here is no such option for homosexual offenses\" except capital punishment.\n \n Nice company.",
