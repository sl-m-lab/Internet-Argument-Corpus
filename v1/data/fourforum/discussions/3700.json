He uses a microscope to study it. He describes it. He publishes his findings in a paper. A lab in Germany, another in the USA, one in Japan, and one in Scotland all get samples of living 'x' and each lab follows a scientific method in observing 'x' under the microscope. Their reports match the initial report. It is published because peer review has checked the facts and 'x' is said to be a certain way. It enters the realm of scientific 'fact'.\n HOWEVER, Gleick goes on to say, that 'x' is observed by a microscope using a source of light to illuminate it. Unknown to the scientists is that 'x' is light sensitive. In order to perform an observation, the scientist influences the observation. Each lab is using similar lights/microscopes and thus affecting their observations in the same way. You can not, according to Gleick, know how 'x' really behaves; or more to the point, repeated observations are only of a limited value as explanation of how 'x' behaves. He then returns to the old puzzle, if a tree falls in a forest and no one is there, does it make a sound? To which he answers \"You can't know\".",

I do know that there's more than one.\n \n \n \n As I stated to thebootfitter on post #201 of &#8220;Lets discuss the actual reason creationists object to evolution&#8221;&#8230;\n \n Your own site suggests\n 1. Make observations. \n 2. Form a testable, unifying hypothesis to explain these observations. \n 3. Deduce predictions from the hypothesis. \n 4. Search for confirmations of the predictions; \n if the predictions are contradicted by empirical observation, go back to step (2).\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/sciproof.html\n This of course reduces the purely hypothetical sciences to non-science! On the issue of 'order doesn't matter' what person makes searches for predictions that they haven't predicted?\n \n \n \n However, it should be noted that\n a) there is more than one\n b) your version is based on a particular philosophy of science\n Your own site suggests this, not only that, I've already pointed this fact out to you already, and you just ignore this as you scoot around looking for more side-issues to debate.\n &#8221;What is the scientific method? This is a complex and contentious question, and the field of inquiry known as the philosophy of science is committed to illuminating the nature of the scientific method. Probably the most influential philosopher of science of the 20th century was Sir Karl Popper. Other notables are Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, Paul Feyerabend, Paul Kitcher, A. F. Chalmers, Wesley Salmon and Bas C. van Fraassen. This is not the place to delve into an explication of the various philosophies represented by these scholars;\"\n (Ibid)\n This suggest\n a) the scientific method is based in philosophy\n b) Karl Popper has heavily influenced this\n c) there are other philosophies of what is scientific method.\n \n Further&#8230;\n \n \"...The tools of scientific study and analysis, instead, are determined by human choices. These choices differ among the scientific fields, and consequently, there is no one scientific method\"\n \n http://www.law.umich.edu/thayer/panel.htm\n \n \"The Journal of Mind and Behavior... is based upon the premise that all meaningful statements about human behavior rest ultimately upon observation &#8212; with no one scientific method possessing, a priori, greater credence than another. Emphasis upon experimental control should not preclude the experiment as a measure of behavior outside the scientific laboratory.\"\n \n http://www.ume.maine.edu/~jmb/about.html\n \n There's an on-line book...\n 1. Introduction \n Overview\n 1 Thumbnail History of Scientific Methods\n 3 Myth of a Scientific Method\n 12 Scientific Methods\n In which he states\n \"We scientists can abandon the idea of &#8216;the scientific method&#8217; but still embrace the concept of &#8216;scientific methods&#8217; -- a suite of logical techniques, xperimental techniques, principles, evaluation standards, and even ethical standards. Unlike Francis Bacon and Ren\u00e8 Descartes, modern scientists can select from this suite without rejecting the constructs of those who choose to use different methods. We must, however, know the limitations of both our methods and theirs.\n \n http://www.mines.utah.edu/geo/people/faculty/jarrard/Text/booktoc.html\n \n \"In the case of scientific theories, the basic logical empiricist approaches were variations on the idea of instrumentalism, the view that scientific theories were predictive instruments and that the knowledge they represent is limited to what they predict about the observable properties of observables. In the case of scientific methods, strategies for rational reconstruction have not been so easy to formulate. Here's the problem. Almost all of the methods scientists actually use in conducting experimental or observational studies are theory dependent: they depend for their justification on knowledge reflected in previously established theories. Kuhn's (1970) discussion of \"normal science\" makes this point especially clearly, but all of the logical empiricists were acutely aware of it. Moreover, in sciences like physics, chemistry, molecular biology and astronomy, almost all of those methods seem prima facie to rest on knowledge of unobservable phenomena (just think about the presuppositions of the design of any experiment in chemistry). What the project of rational reconstruction must show is that (almost) all of these methods can be reconstructed in such a way that their application, as guides to the identification of empirically adequate theories, does not require positing knowledge of unobservables.\"\n \n http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/\n \n To a lesser extent, here are two:\n \n Induction and Deduction (152)\n A. contrasts two philosophies of scientific method:\n 1. Inductive: that one begins with observation, experiment\n 2. (Deductive): that experiments are always preceded\n by some theory or idea (153)\n \n http://www.iit.edu/~schmaus/Philosophy_of_Science/lectures/Hacking/experiment.txt\n \n \"There is no such thing as \"the\" scientific method. Science uses many methods. There will never be a pat answer to the question \"what is science\". The very notion that there could be a pat answer bespeaks an attachment to rote learning that is incompatible with scientific thinking.\"\n \n http://www.av8n.com/physics/scientific-methods.htm\n \n I also suggested that you can study the various methods at university...\n \n http://www.registrar.dal.ca/calendar/class.php?subj=ctmp&num=3000\n \n Historically, there were others\n \n ead \"The Scientific Methods of Rene Descartes and Francis Bacon\" at\n \n http://www.thingsrevealed.net/dscrtbacn.htm\n \n \n \n \" The rediscovery post-Merton of the social nature of science has thrown eternal Scientific Methods out the window, but that doesn't mean that science is no longer distinguishable from non-science. It just isn't as easy as one would like in an ideal world. Last I looked, it wasn't an ideal world, anyway.\"\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/falsify.html",
