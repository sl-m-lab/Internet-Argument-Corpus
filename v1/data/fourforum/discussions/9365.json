You guys are getting off-topic.\n\n \n My earlier comments stated that there are bigger and more important issues that \"divide\" us, and that using the civil rights of gays as just another reason to divide is wrong.\n \n Since then, I guess the point has been driven home as we have seen different members of the board \"divided\" over the issues if war, violence, etc.....\n \n So again I ask, Why does anyone choose to fight gays rights, knowing it divides us all further rather than building community? Why do we, as humans, choose to not respect others even in small things like who they choose to shack up with when some people don't even have a place to \"shack\" at all, let alone food to eat?\n \n Those who are opposed to gay rights (not all but most) seem to concentrate their energy on fighting gays, rather than finding a middle ground or making any effort to help gays. I propose that if those who oppose gays were to find middle ground their would be more unity in this country, I could be wrong.\n \n I do agree with Martin Luther King, Jr's words when he said \"it is either nonviolence or nonexistence\". Right now the violence we see in this country is small compare to what we will see in the years to come when the younger ones who have played nothing buy violent video game since birth get older, have money and weld power. We either need to find common ground now, or just nonexist. Perhaps a truce between the gay and the any-gay would be a fine start. We need to start someplace!\n \n When givin the choice would you let other you disagree with have what they \"need\" to unite or deny it and divide us further?",

Equal rights!\n \n There's no sound reason to redefine words just for the sake of a small minority of people who feel they have been slighted.\n\n \n I have absolutely no problem with keeping marriage a matter of the church and having the government do civil unions for everyone (note, that means both heteros and gays), and doing away with church involvement in the state legal unions altogether. Some churches can still do gay religious marriages, and gays can go to those churches that aren't bigoted against them for their marriage if they want a religious ceremony. Bigoted hetero churches can keep their ceremonies to heterosexual marriage: it won't have any effect on the legal part.",

Were I fighting it, you'd be reading about me in the papers.\n \n ...and you would be correct.\n \n Just as I think it is ridiculous to rename a street after a politician, I think it is ridculous to redefine a word just so more people can be called by that word when those people didn't fit into the definition of that word to begin with.\n \n I'm not trying to keep anything from gays except the tag \"married\". I sincerely hope gays have equal rights and equal treatment in all regards. There are ways to do this without redefining words.\n\n \n It isn't redefining marriage by making all government recognized unions into civil unions. All it is doing, is getting the government out of a religious ceremony, and making a legal union. That way, people can call it whatever they like in public, it will just be a civil union in the government's eyes. \n \n I think you have lost all credibility here with your ridiculous arguments about \"staticians\".\n \n Oh, here's a way for you to get what you want (stop gays from getting the \"tag\" married) - Make everything civil unions and leave the marriages to the churches. *Gasp* Wow, maybe that's what we've been suggesting all along, ya think?\n \n By-the-by, you've already failed as gays have already gotten married in churches, and go by the \"tag\" married.",

   "Do you realize sensitive you've become? I've said nothing of denying fundamental rights. There are other ways to secure them rather than redefining marriage. The pacification comes in changing the definition, not in granting the rights. I agree, you should have all the rights.\n\n \n It's interesting to me that I find that more and more people I talk to agree with that view, and completely understand it. It's quite mainstream. It baffles me that some here just can't understand this. It's very simple--there are plenty of people who have no problem with gay couples having couples' rights. That's why it's basically a lie everytime someone says people who feel this way \"are trying take away gays' rights\", or \"against gays having their rights.\" The rub is \"marriage.\" I've seen gays say in reponse 'it's just a term' and 'why get hung up on the term.' To that I say if it's just a term, why do you want to take it over so badly? \n \n That's why I'm convinced that for many gay marriage proponents, it's not necessarily even about the rights--there are plenty of people like you and me that are more than willing to give them their rights. What this is really about is a push for legitimacy. At the end of the day, this is really about gays wanting validation of their relationships. If it weren't, they'd be willing to explore other options to get the benefits they want. They want the \"M\" word because many of them view it as a stamp of legitimacy to their type of relationships. And that's why I have no problem with not supporting gay marriage--I'm not about to put my support behind something that's really just a way to take over another group's institution mostly just to feel good about themselves. Do gays have a legitimate case for wanting couples' benefits? Certainly. I can see the merits of their arguments. Do they have a case for wanting to redefine an opposite-sex institution to do it?

   "Did blacks try to be included under the term \"white\" to get civil rights?\n \n Did women take over men's terminology for themselves during the suffrage movement?\n\n \n They were included in the terms or titles, facilities or institutions which previously were only afforded whites or males.

I won't hold my breath to see you get on that campaign. You don't want gays to have what you have, because marriage is of such a high value. Gays are not worthy of having what you have.

   "It's interesting to me that I find that more and more people I talk to agree with that view, and completely understand it. It's quite mainstream. It baffles me that some here just can't understand this. It's very simple--there are plenty of people who have no problem with gay couples having couples' rights. That's why it's basically a lie everytime someone says people who feel this way \"are trying take away gays' rights\", or \"against gays having their rights.\" The rub is \"marriage.\" I've seen gays say in reponse 'it's just a term' and 'why get hung up on the term.' To that I say if it's just a term, why do you want to take it over so badly? \n \n That's why I'm convinced that for many gay marriage proponents, it's not necessarily even about the rights--there are plenty of people like you and me that are more than willing to give them their rights. What this is really about is a push for legitimacy. At the end of the day, this is really about gays wanting validation of their relationships. If it weren't, they'd be willing to explore other options to get the benefits they want. They want the \"M\" word because many of them view it as a stamp of legitimacy to their type of relationships. And that's why I have no problem with not supporting gay marriage--I'm not about to put my support behind something that's really just a way to take over another group's institution mostly just to feel good about themselves. Do gays have a legitimate case for wanting couples' benefits? Certainly. I can see the merits of their arguments. Do they have a case for wanting to redefine an opposite-sex institution to do it? Hell no.\n\n \n Yes. It's a push for equal social recognition and legitimacy on the part of gays. Do you have a problem with gays receiving the same recognition, and being treated as legitimate and feeling good about themselves? It seems like you do. That's your problem, because we will be taking over society's institutions, just as you have for many years, whether you want us there are not. We are here. We are not going away. Our place is equal to yours in every way.\n \n Straight people do not want to give up the word marriage, because of the tangible benefits, as well as the social recognition and legitimization received for their relationships in this important institution.",

It was.\n This has been proven over and over again.\n In the mid-1960's, a MAJORITY of the American public defined \"marriage\" with RACIAL RESTRICTIONS.\n That didn't change until the late 1980's / early 1990's.\n \n You keep claiming something that has been DEFINITIVELY proven wrong.\n \n \n \nIt didn't go to the core of how marriage was defined because even in interracial marriage, it was still between a man and a woman.\n\n YOUR MODERN, 2007, claimed \"core\" ignores race.\n The mid 1960's \"core\" INCLUDED race by a ratio of 3 to 1.\n My claimed \"core\" is two people, regardless of gender.",

Personally, I'm glad I don't live in Canada or the U.K., where freedom of speech and religious freedom have been sacrificed because it's all too easy for the Orwellian govts there to call anyone stating their religious beliefs about homosexuality as 'hate speech.'\n\n \n I don't support any prohibitions of speach or religion, nor am I saying that I believe either are in danger. BUT that said - - anti-gay chat from religious groups is hateful. Saying being gay is immoral is hateful. Saying acting on being gay is hateful. Expecting celebacy and lonliness from an entire group of people due to a trait they can't control is unhealthy and hateful. Saying \"my God says so\" is a cop-out.

   "It isn't redefining marriage by making all government recognized unions into civil unions. All it is doing, is getting the government out of a religious ceremony, and making a legal union. That way, people can call it whatever they like in public, it will just be a civil union in the government's eyes. \nThe government hasn't been in the ceremony part of marriage. The government issues marriage licenses for several reasons. One is to keep track of who's married to whom. Another is to keep people from marrying their close kin.\n \n The government could also issue merging licences. That way they could keep track of who's merged with whom and they could keep men from merging with little boys...brothers getting merged, etc.\n \n There's still no reason to say that marriage needs to be redefined to include same sex mergings.

There is no logical reason to do away with the term \"married couple\" in legal records. It is quite simple to add another group (or two) by saying we'll have three recognized types of civil inions...married couples, mergedmen and mergedwomen.\n \n \n \n\n By-the-by, you've already failed as gays have already gotten married in churches, and go by the \"tag\" married.\nYes they have...legally in some cases and illegally in others. I know of several occassions where people have claimed to be Jesus, too.\n \n \n \nI certainly would not be against it. The only ones I can think of that would be against it are the opponents of gay marriage - they wouldn't accept any sort of union that gave gays equal rights to their precious \"marriage\".\nThis is a good example of why you are not worth the effort in serious debate. It has been explained to you that there is no desire to deny any rights or benefits to anyone. You are welcome to all the rights that married people have. You just can't be one without marrying the opposite gender.\n \n \nWe ARE worried about having a seperate term to apply to gay marriage. That sets up a seperate-but-equal situation, and we all know how those work out *coughsegregatedschoolscouch*. Much better to either include gays in \"marriage\", or make it all civil unions - all under one system, not two.\nAs expected, you are beating a dead horse. The school argument does not apply. Read this entire thread several times and you may come to understand that.\n \n \n \n...\n \n I have really never even seen the need for gender specific bathrooms, and there is rarely a seperat-but-equal thing that has turned out good. The unisex ones at my college worked fine. You see, the problem is that if gays have a seperate one, it sets a precedent for changes and restrictions made for gay marriages, while more benifits are provided for heterosexual marriages and not for gays. All this besides the fact of how much more money it would cost to set up a completely separate system rather than just including gays and heteros in one.\nHogwash! There's no need for separate sets of laws. A single constitutional amendment could guarantee equal rights for all couples regardless of which list they are on...and it would apply to ALL STATES OF THE UNION. (You won't have to live in Massachusetts to get the benefits.)\n \n ...and the need for gender specific restrooms is driven by the desire to keep innocent young girls from having to drop their pants in the same room with horny males...of all ages. Unless you're to argue that total free love and sex between all people should be permitted, you must attach some value to keeping the genders apart in their youth. Unisex works okay in some office buildings where adults are predominant but would not work well in elementary schools, highschools, public venues such as auditoriums, museums, stadiums etc where the crowds are relatively uncontrolled. I know I wouldn't have wanted my daughters to have to pee with naturally horny men lurking nearby.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYes. It's a push for equal social recognition and legitimacy on the part of gays. Do you have a problem with gays receiving the same recognition, and being treated as legitimate and feeling good about themselves? It seems like you do. That's your problem, because we will be taking over society's institutions, just as you have for many years, whether you want us there are not. We are here. We are not going away. Our place is equal to yours in every way.\n \n Straight people do not want to give up the word marriage, because of the tangible benefits, as well as the social recognition and legitimization received for their relationships in this important institution.\nYou are making less and less sense here. The gay minority will never grow much larger than it is now. While it is true that as a human you deserve all the rights afforded to other humans, it is not true that total social recognition and legitimization will occur. Being gay will never be the norm. If you want to discuss the norm, we should start another thread in the Open Forum.\n \n \nPeople still are getting beaten to death in America for being gay. Yeah, I'm sensitive about it.\nPeople still get beat to death over a pair of sneakers...and it's not just America where gays suffer. Try being gay in Saudi Arabia.\n \n \n \n\n ......\n \n \n Wait, what's simple? I listed a bunch of additional rules you would need before you could implement your idea, which are you talking about here?\n...and I see the only need for new rules to be in the addition of two new categories of couples. Please explain to me why you think this could be so difficult.\n \n \n \n\n Ok then, this just bumps the question up a level. What's the big deal about redefining something? The definition of words change, it just happens. The defintion of legal terms, which is what we're talking about here, change all the time; it just takes the stroke of a pen. Pretty much every time a legislature sits some legal term gets changed; it's not a big deal.\n \n You say you want gays to get their rights; great. The simplest and fairest way for them to get the rights that go with marriage is to let them get married; one small legal change as opposed to all the laws you would need with your system (my previous post lists a handful, I'm sure more might be necessary). You say you want to go the more complicated route just to avoid redeining a word; I don't get that. What's the big deal?\nAs I explained above, all it would take is a single amendment granting the same rights to all recognized couples be they married or merged. That's pretty simple and does not require the redefinition of \"married\".\n \n \nAs long as they keep it to their homes and churches. I don't care what they say.\n\n \n Who are you to limit where words can be spoken? The same might be said of your relentless comments about the evil world you picture yourself in...keep your comments in your home and your church. How would you like that restriction placed upon you?",

For better or worse, we simply have no choice but to take it state by state. That's the reality of the situation, and to act otherwise would be to waste time and energy. You'll note that not even the most ardent, idealistic gay rights supporters here have bothered to suggest a federal gay rights amendment? We'd all love to see one, but it just isn't going to happen. Remember, you only need 13 states to say no and an amendment is blocked. You say why fight 50 battles?

Lots of unneccessary thing happen that you don't oppose, why the fuss over this one? And while I disagree with how easy you think it would be to get a federal amendment passed, let me bounce it back and ask you this. All 50 states at once is better than none, sure. But some is better than none as well. If a state did redifine marriage to allow gays, then they would have their rights, which you say you think is a good thing. Redefining marriage would work, it would do what needs doing. Why oppose that?",

   "It's interesting to me that I find that more and more people I talk to agree with that view, and completely understand it. It's quite mainstream. It baffles me that some here just can't understand this. It's very simple--there are plenty of people who have no problem with gay couples having couples' rights. That's why it's basically a lie everytime someone says people who feel this way \"are trying take away gays' rights\", or \"against gays having their rights.\" The rub is \"marriage.\" I've seen gays say in reponse 'it's just a term' and 'why get hung up on the term.' To that I say if it's just a term, why do you want to take it over so badly? \n \n That's why I'm convinced that for many gay marriage proponents, it's not necessarily even about the rights--there are plenty of people like you and me that are more than willing to give them their rights. What this is really about is a push for legitimacy. At the end of the day, this is really about gays wanting validation of their relationships. If it weren't, they'd be willing to explore other options to get the benefits they want. They want the \"M\" word because many of them view it as a stamp of legitimacy to their type of relationships. And that's why I have no problem with not supporting gay marriage--I'm not about to put my support behind something that's really just a way to take over another group's institution mostly just to feel good about themselves. Do gays have a legitimate case for wanting couples' benefits? Certainly. I can see the merits of their arguments. Do they have a case for wanting to redefine an opposite-sex institution to do it? Hell no.\n\n \n I wanted to have another go at this comment. I was thinking about how giving couples, gay or straight, any recognition will legitimize the relationship to some degree. Thus, if one supports benefits, registered partnerships, or civil unions for gay couples, that's what is happening.

   "Merged it is.\n...and it will apply to either male-male or female-female couples. Then there would be three types of legally recognized (for purposes of protecting rights and privileges of) civil unions.\n \n civil unions = mc, mm or mf (married coupled, merged males or merged females)\n \n All civil unions shall be afforded equal rights under existing marriage laws \n \n \n\n But don't you see? The divorce laws only cover marriage, not mergings. The polygamy laws only cover getting married twice, not getting merged twice or merged and married. \"merging\" didn't exist when those laws were written, so they wouldn't cover merging. Every single law which deals with marriage will have to be duplicated to cover merging.\nThere is no need to write new laws. You simple add mm and mf to the list of couples being controlled by marriage and divorce laws.\n \n The closest I know of in doing this is the Netherlands. Same-sex couples have every right of marriage except the name. Find out what they did and do that here.\n \n \n \n\n I'm not talking about some clerk being a jerk. I\"m talking about a state that requires a blood test and 3 day waiting period for marriage licenses saying that you need to pass a full physical, wait 2 weeks, and then take another physical to get a merging license. And charging 100 dollars to the marriage liecenses 10. You'll need one more law saying you have to have the same requirments, or this sort of thing is bound to happen.\nSo, you're talking of whoever sets the fees as being a jerk. That's simple enough also...if the fee for a marriage license is fixed, the same fee would be fixed for the merging license.\n \n It only takes one set of definitive laws to cover these three groups of loving couples.\n \n \n \n\n I was refering to a state constitutional amendment there, not federal.\nWhy fight a battle with 50 siblings when you get get Daddy to crack the whip?\n \n \n\n Yeah, in a monarchy your idea might fly. I'll grant you that.\nMonarchy or not, it only takes one iron-clad set of rules to cover these three groups of loving couples. (Where have I seen that before?)\n \n \n\n Sure, one swell foop would be great. But that's not the system we live in. The simple fact of the matter is that the federal government can't regulate marriage, and a federal gay rights amendment will never pass in my life time. For better or worse, we simply have no choice but to take it state by state. That's the reality of the situation, and to act otherwise would be to waste time and energy. You'll note that not even the most ardent, idealistic gay rights supporters here have bothered to suggest a federal gay rights amendment? We'd all love to see one, but it just isn't going to happen. Remember, you only need 13 states to say no and an amendment is blocked. You say why fight 50 battles? To pass an amendment you need to fight 50 battles all at the same time, and you can only lose 12.\nI contend that the only way you'll get equal rights throughout the 50 states is by through changes (amendments to) the U.S. Constitution.\n \n \n\n And refuted above. They only apply to married couples. Laws are specific, you can't just start applying them in other situations just because they're kinda similar without specifically writing a new law that says you can.\nIf clearly and concisely written, a single law can be used to modify thousands of existing laws. It would be quite easy to include new coverages in old laws. Granted, the wording would need careful consideration to avoid ambiguities (you know how lawyers look for weaknesses in wording), but it could be done without creating any new similar-but-not-quite-equal laws.\n \n \n\n \"There is no need\" is no answer. Lots of unneccessary thing happen that you don't oppose, why the fuss over this one? And while I disagree with how easy you think it would be to get a federal amendment passed, let me bounce it back and ask you this. All 50 states at once is better than none, sure. But some is better than none as well. If a state did redifine marriage to allow gays, then they would have their rights, which you say you think is a good thing. Redefining marriage would work, it would do what needs doing. Why oppose that?\n\"There is no need\" is an answer. You may argue whether there is a need or not. That's what you are saying here anyway. You see a need to modify the definition...I say there is none. Everything you need (rights, benefits, privileges, access to courts and divorces, access to services, etc., etc.) can be had without redefining a single word...and without offending those who would definitely be offended by the change you propose. All you need are two new words to take the place of my \"merges\". However, I think Holy Merging has a distinctly sincere and bonding sound, much the same as Holy Matrimony.\n \n One previous poster has said something about taking marriage away from the government and leaving it to the churches. Getting all churches to agree to the same rules will be TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE (probability so near zero you might as well call it that!) I suspect that poster is a member of a congregation that would accept ss-marriage and is likewise unconcerned with gays who may be members of congregations that would so \"no way\".\n \n I'm relatively sure that gays exist in every denomination, but their acceptance varies widely.\n \n A Federal amendment will solve the problem for you. A compromise to take the rights but give up the namequest would likely speed the process along.\n \n You have yet to support a need for the redefinition of marriage...other than, \"We want to be called 'married'\".

And for homosexuality, people have presented no real proof that homosexuality is not benign.\n Other issues like promiscuity, unprotected sex, etc, etc., ...\n ... whether it be gay or straight? Yeah. Those are not benign.\n But homosexuality itself? There has been nothing presented which shows it is inherently not benign.",

I don't really give a flying-monkey's-anus whether or not churches would agree on those rules or not - they have the religious institution of marriage for them to define individually among churches(some of which, I might add, some gay marriages), which is seperate from the government \"institution\" of marriage.\nWhat I get is that the state recognizes the legally performed joining of a male and a female by a qualified administrator (be it the clergy, a ship's captain, a Justice of the Peace, etc) as a marriage. The operative phrase is \"a male and a female\". \n \n The more liberal churches and those whose members have established support for a relaxing of the definition to include same-sex couples should not expect the government to flop over and say \"okay\". \n \n Changing rules in the church takes nothing more than a dispensation from the pompous asses running the church...and if you think that's in any way democratic, take a deep look at the RCC.\n \n What's to keep a looney California church from insisting that a pair of monkeys got married last week and now wants all the benefits of a married couple?\n \n Changing rules in the government requires legislation, voting, signing into law. Though the will of the people (of the WHOLE COUNTRY) is sometimes hard to determine, our laws are not as subject to the whims of the rulers as are those of the churches. \n \n \nHmm. What about trans-gendered? If someone gets a sex change then what happens? Just one more set of complications your system would engender.\nThey would present no more of a problem in the future than they now do.\n \n \n\n Like i said, there's another law you need.\nNo need for another law...just embellish the law that will say that all couples have equal rights to preclude any differences in fees and tests...not a problem.\n \n \n\n I answered this. To get a federal amendment you need 3/4 of the states to agree with you. You have to get 37 states to follow you all at the same time. That's so much harder than taking it one state at a time I can't even begin to imagine how to pull it off.\nUntil the acceptance is across the board, there will be problems with leaving it to state governments. (What happens when I ss-couple moves from a state that recognizes their \"marriage\" to one that doesn't?)\n \n \n\n Do you really think such an amendment could be passed? Say whatever else you like on the subject, but answer that one quesiton. Could such an amendment pass?\nI think it's possible but unlikely. However, I think it's more likely than your possibility of getting the same privileges in every state one at a time.\n \n \n\n Aha! That's it, isn't it? That's why you don't want to change the definition, because some people (including you? let me know) can't separate in their minds the difference between what the state calls marriage and what the church calls marriage. I'm looking for a change in a legal definition; what I'm proposing has absolutely nothing to do with Holy Matrimony. Does your resistance hinge entirely on the fact that \"marriage\" means two things? One religious and one legal?\nTry not to speak for me. You only confuse the issue.\n \n What you are proposing has lots to do with Holy Matrimony. You seem to be wanting all of the churches to change their definition of marriage.\n \n I'd bet my last dollars that the Jews will be among the last, if ever they recognize same-sex couples as \"married\". Marriage has been a sacred thing for thousands of years and has been defined as the union of a man and a woman for those thousands of years. Just think, our government and associated laws came into existence only a couple of hundred years ago. Marriage has been the bonding of male and female humans for thousands of years all over the world. And now you and your ilk want to change that...WHY...THERE IS NO REASONABLE NEED! You can have all the rights and privileges, tax deductions, grants, payouts, handouts, etc. that you want...without being called \"married\". Yet you would spit on the heritage of all those who oppose you just to satisfy your desire for total acceptance and pseudo-legitimacy.\n \n My resistance is not at all connected to any notion that marriage has two meanings because it doesn't. Marriage is the legally performed and recorded bonding of a male human and a female human. Marriage can be administered by the clergy, the JP, or any of a few others. The state recognizes all of them. It just has to be a man and a woman. That's the way it's been since day one. There is no need to change that.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n No, you totally missed his point. The idea is to have the government not care at all what the churches do. Churches can perform, or not, whatever ceremonies they like, and the government wouldn't give a fig. If you want a sanctified union you go to a church and get married, if you want government benefits you go to a court house and get merged. The two institutions would have nothing to do with each other, and there would be no call for the churches to agree on any rules.\nNow you are introducing complications. The state must be included in the legal aspects of marriage in order to enforce laws related to marriage and in order to pass out the various benefits it offers to married couples. Surely you don't suggest that the churches enforce the laws related to marriage and divorce, do you?\n \n \n\n I don't have to show \"need\". You don't redifine a legal term only when you \"need\" to, you do it when it would work, when it would help people. There may be other ways to accomplish that goal, but if redefing a term would be the easiest and fairest way to do it, then that's the way that makes the most sense. Your insistance on \"need\" is an artificial qualification, it's a fake standard that has no call to be there.\nYou actually do have to show a need. If it's just your whims and desires we're going on, let's discuss the whims and desires of those who are opposed to your requested change in order to reach a fair conclusion...last I heard, you lose in this arena. Show me a need to redefine marriage in order for you to get the benefits and I will consider changing my stance and siding with you.",

I don't know why the ERA failed to be adopted. Maybe it was so poorly worded that it would have allowed women to call themselves men or dash into the Men's Rooms across the nation. There are constitutional protections against discrimination in regard to race, sex, national origin, religion etc. For a loooonnnnng time, women could not vote. In some countries, women cannot own anything.\n \n It's been a male-driven world for quite some time...and understandably so...the male is the physically stronger defender of the nest created within the species mating habits as intended by nature. Strength rules. Men get what they want...women serve men's needs and bless the earth with offspring...of both genders...so that life goes on and on and on. When we had no worries except to evade or kill predators and to find enough food for ourselves, the men hunted and the woman gathered food and tended to children back at the campfire.\n \n It wasn't until formal governments were established and communications became global instead of tribal that women had the power to change the posture of their government.\n \n Perhaps you are familiar with Lysistrata.\n \n \n\n Well, I've been pushing you on this question for some time now. You'll have to forgive me if I got a little excited that you gave me some sort of answer.

I am only, only, talking about the secular institution here, not the religious one.\nThen your argument is even weaker than I first thought. I do not agree that there are two institutions of marriage. I do agree that there are two institutions (government and church) that define marriage the same way...one male gets married to one female. Both institutions prescribe and attempt to enforce rules related to marriage just as both institutions prescribe and attempt to enforce rules and laws related to abortion. While the definition of abortion is the same in both institutions, the requirements and punishments meted out by the two institutions differ greatly.\n \n I once dated a girl who had had an abortion and suffered the admonition and subsequent punishment of the RCC. She suffered not at the hands of the government. I was able to convince her that the RCC is no holier than the least of us even though the clergy (self-annointed rulers) struts around in gilded robes wearing pointy little crowns they gave each other, weilding scepters and pretending to carry the only set of keys to Heaven. Though she was punished by the church, she was protected by the government...and the definition of abortion hasn't changed.\n \n \n\n I'm not sure how I can make this clearer. Let's try an analogy. You're hungry. You need food. You eat a steak. Did you need the steak? No. You could have eaten something else, but the steak was right there in the fridge and you were in the mood for steak, so that's what you ate.

I have tried to show that letting gays get married would be easier and fairer, and that's all I have to do. I don't have to show that it's the only neccessary solution, just that it's the best one. If you want to block this solution, I think it's you that needs to show that it needs to be blocked. Letting gays get married would work, I've not seen you deny that.

Marriage is not...but I'll play this hand for a bit:\n \n I'm hungry, you're hungry. I eat A, you eat B. We're both satiated. But NO!! You pitch a fit because our food was different. Your demand to redefine marriage is not unlike Christians saying, \"We want all food defined as being Kosher!\"\n \n You have yet to prove that letting gays marry is the easiest way to ensure equality.\n \n You have indeed tried to show that letting gays marry would be easier and more fair...but you have proved neither of these. The best solution will be the one that pleases most of the people involved.\n \n You have indeed not yet seen me deny that letting gays get married would work. I am certain that it would work for your selfish purposes. I am also certain it would work to the detriment of many, many peoples who do not share your particular set of values.\n \n I want something that works well with damn near everybody. You are far from showing that your solution is the best one. One particular advantage mine has over yours is that it changes NOTHING about marriage..including the definition of it. This will please the vast majority of people who now can call themselves married. You don't need to be called married.\n \n \n Show me a need to change the definition!",

Unless you do away with churches and religions, this will always be the case.\n \n You will likely never get the definition of marriage changed to include same-sex unions. You can call yourself married all you want. That will not make it so in the eyes of all those from which you seek acceptance and legitimacy. The fire-and-brimstone preachers of abominations will never disappear and their flocks will never cease to shout, \"Amen!\"\n \n Since the redefinition of marriage would offend so many people, why do you insist upon it when other methods are available to get what you actually deserve from the government? You don't really need to be called \"married\" by the government. The government doesn't need to redefine marriage just to give you inner peace when it would disturb the inner peace of many times more people than are gathered around you. You are a very small minority group.\n \n Churches can place all the restrictions they desire upon any facet of life as long as civil rights are not denied and laws are not violated. Private clubs can do the same. Restuarants can reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason. Companies can refuse to hire you for any reason. There are many members of the club of married couples that do not want to let you in. They have valid reason...you do not fit the definition. There is no reason for them to change the definition just to let you in. They don't want you in...because they believe in the definition of a married couple...a man and a woman blah blah blah.\n \n Start your own club and refuse us membership. Let the government maintain all the same rights and privileges to your club as it does to ours. We won't care.\n\n \n Gay people are not going to give up the fight for equality because there are others in society who do not want this. The fact that religious people specifically or others may be offended is not a reason to abanndon equal rights. Nothing would ever change, and gays would still be put in prison or worse. Women would not be able to vote, if offending others was the concern.\n \n The privileged class has something, and they don't want others to have it also. The dominant class of heteros, or men, or whites, would then cease to be privileged. It would no longer dominate.

Yeah! Let's change all the old things whether we need to or not.\n\n \n Well, your only arguments are tradition and dominance.

I consider the feelings and desires of the whole population to be just as important as yours or mine. I want you to convince me that your simple plan will be better and more benficial to the whole nation than mine.\n \n \n\n Yeah, but just because you keep repeating it doesn't make it true.\nYet you have not shot holes in the repeated text. I have said that we guarantee the rights to people of all colors without redefining them as being the same color...I have said that we guarantee rights to people of all religions without redefining their religion tags...we can guarantee the rights of all couples without changing the definition of marriage. \n \n \n \n\n Frankly, I don't care it you \"welcome\" me to do it or not. If changing the defintion is the best path to equality, then that's the path I'll pursue.\nAgain, what is best for the country may not match what you think is best for you.\n \n \n\n Are you really ready to go there? Do you acknowledge that \"making the most people happy\" is not the way to choose what's best?\nSuch a blanket statement is dangerous to acknowledge. Clearly, if we allowed public orgies, there would be a glut of happy people, but this is no where close to what's best.\n \n \n\n What? If gays get married then your \"identity\" is gone? What are you talking about?\nNot my identity. My identity is not threatened at all. Consider the masses of heterosexual married couples who identify with and respect the term \"married\" for what it is - a bond between a man and a woman. Being \"married\" identifies a male as one who has a female mate. You would take that away.\n \n \n\n Fascinating opinion, but the question was what detrimental effects gays getting married would have.\nI think the effects of gays insisting on calling their unions marriages are detrimental to the mass of people mentioned above. It offends them to be identified with gays.\n \n Like it or not, you will never be accepted with open arms and a kind heart by that mass. Just as you are not going away, neither are they. I personally have several gay and lesbian friends with whom I associate on a daily basis. We have discussed this issue in detail and not one of them sees any reason to change the definition of marriage.\n \n \n \n \n \nDid blacks have to prove a \"need\" to sit at the front of the bus?\nWe've already covered this.\n \n No, they didn't...and they also did not NEED to be called \"white\" in order to sit in the front. They got all the rights of the white people and we still call a black a black and a white a white. With the same resulting benefits and rights you want, we can still call heterosexual couples married and gay couples by some other name.\n \n It's that frickin' simple.",

   "People can have equal access to services, facilities, institutions, jobs, etc., without changing who they are, by taking on the identity of those who excluded them. The fact that such things became associated with the dominant group, who excluded the others for no other reasons besides bigotry or tradition, or power, is the problem. Those are the reasons being given. Jim's Trucking was honest enough to say, it's because straight people don't want to be identified with gay people in the last post, an obvious statement of bigotry. I don't share the pessimistic view that won't change.\n \n With equal marriage, everyone, gay or straight will be married. Straight people are not giving anything up. Same-race couples didn't give up the term when inter-racial couples were allowed, or inter-faith, or non-religious. Those who want their marriage to be defined as an old-fashioned union for life, don't have to be divorced or re-married. Especially if religious beliefs demand a few of those things from them. Yes, marriage has come to be associated with straight relationships for a long time. However, we should look at the reasons for the exclusion of a part of society, gay people, from this institution. It needs to change to reflect society's changes, the society that constructs it and keeps it relevent. As I said, I don't share the pessimistic view that gay people won't be fully embraced into society and everything it has to offer as others are.",

A small portion of the population? A larger portion of the population? What is good and beneficial to you may be bad and detrimental to others.

   "So, you want them to chose to live their lives in a way that you see fit. Sure doesn't sound like your original statement. You are falsely representing yourself with one or the other, which is it?\nNeither.\n \n In regard to my seeing fit that all people respect the rights of law-abiding others, yes, it is correct that I want others to live as I see fit. In the way that you meant it, no. You (and anyone else that chooses) can live your life as you please as long as you don't interfere with the rights of others.\n \n In this thread I've seen the comment that gays are not looking for the churches to come up with a blanket redefinition of marriage but only for the government to utilize a new definition. I believe that comment was followed by something like \"we don't care at all what the churches do\". This seems backwards if it is social equity and respect that you think will come from redefinition. As I have said before, just because someone calls you something doesn't mean that's what you are. It's only when you deal in well defined terms, known and understood to mean the same to the speaker and the listeners that you can call a spade a spade and it really be a spade.\n \n If you get the government but not the churches to redefine marriage, you will have gained nothing more than you would have gained by law without redefinition. You will have no more respect from society than you now have.\n \n I have seen none of you refute the argument that redfinition is unnecessary in the course of guaranteeing your rights...only that it could be done simply. I have not seen any convincing argument that \"separate but equal\" systems would result from leaving the definition as it is.\n \n Quite frankly, I am more convinced than I was last year that all you want to do is be able to say, \"We won!\"\n \n I am not your enemy. Rest assured, your real enemies would shudder at the thought of having such a dialog with you.\n \n \nSo, if for a long amount of time, churches as well as government both viewed slavery as acceptable, we should still have slaves, correct? \nI'd like to see you tie those thoughts into this issue, especially in regard to changes of definitions.\n \n \n For some reason, I don't see any slaves any more, I wonder why?\nPerhaps you are not looking in the right places. Slavery exists big time in India, Pakistan, in the US prostitution ring system, the factories that make Martha Stewart clothing, Nike shoes, etc. I am a slave to my girlfriends now and then, too. I have a slave computer server, a slave flash system...There are slaves everywhere I turn, some legal, some not.\n \n \n \n\n emoticon_xhoho emoticon_xhoho emoticon_xagree Very correct, in fact, much closer analogy than either jim or Kronus came up with.\nNeither one of the two tries you mentioned is valid in this argument. The act of denial of anything is not being pushed. The only food analogy that really comes close is what I said about Christians wanting to redefine all foods as Kosher.\n \n What's Kosher here is a marriage between a male and a female. You would be the Christians and that huge group of people you want equality with would be the Jews. I would be the one standing to the side and saying, \"There is no need.\"\n \n \nGay people are not going to give up the fight for equality because there are others in society who do not want this. The fact that religious people specifically or others may be offended is not a reason to abanndon equal rights. Nothing would ever change, and gays would still be put in prison or worse. Women would not be able to vote, if offending others was the concern.\nI have not advocated you giving up any fight for equality for any reason. Equal rights would not be abandonned. Your getting equal rights (and benefits) does not hinge on the redefinition of marriage just as blacks getting equal rights did not hinge of a redefinition of white people. (Man, it looks like that tact backfired on you.)\n \n \n \n\n The privileged class has something, and they don't want others to have it also. The dominant class of heteros, or men, or whites, would then cease to be privileged. It would no longer dominate. That prospect is what offends them. \nThis has nothing to do with classes. (That, my friend is an entirely different debate topic.) I don't know your connotation of \"privileged\" but the rights, benefits and privileges you seek will come only from written laws and will be equally available to all. Just as you cannot legislate morality, you cannot legislate for social acceptance and respect. No person will ever be obligated by the government to respect your standards...only to respect your right to have different standards.\n \n \n \n\n Indeed you are putting us in our place when you call us a very small minority, that would offend the majority in seeking what they have. You tell us to just accept the dominance of the heterosexuals. \n...and I think you misunderstand what I have written here. I'm not into domination...far from it. Please explain the inference. \n \n \n \n\n Well, your only arguments are tradition and dominance. Gays want into all of society, and all its institutions with their tangible and intangible benefits. Marriage will help gays and their families as part of society, in the same way it helps straights.\nAgain, where did the dominance claim come from? Just play by the rules and live alongside people who differ with you.\n \n Show me a NEED to change the definition of marriage. Show me how you will be dominated if you don't get it changed.\n \n \nNow, why would you think a person whose handle is \"jim's trucking\" and who doesn't appear to have given a thought in hell to the realities of gay inequity would support a heterosexist dominant agenda?\nYou're equally as off base as your predecessor...and what does my \"handle\" have to do with this?

   "Quite untrue, Kronus. You gripe about rights and say it's unfair that two men can't be legally married...I asked for you to list ANY right that is being denied to you that cannot be given by law without redefinition and you cannot name one. There is none...with the obvious exception of the use of the word in describing gay couples. That is no more significant than my not having the right to call myself a doctor.\n \n If something is unnecessary as a tool in your getting your legal rights under our constitution, then you must show me a need to change a definition or I will be against it. That you and a bunch of others want to does not constitute a need.\n \n I have been responding to arguments with pure logic...not emotionally driven pleas for understanding and compassion.\n \n What really ticks you off is the fact that you cannot come up with a legitimate need.\n\n As we have said over and over again, the only thing remotely close to a \"need\" that we need to show, is the need to stop discrimination against same-sex couples. That's the only need that women and blacks really had to show.",

   "You're right about that. In general, the changes that occur in cultural and social constructs are driven by the majority...not by the whinings of a minority feigning discrimination. There is justification in maintaining separate identities.\n\n \n It is discrimination, nothing is being faked. There is no justification in segregation. What, we the minority are not to say anything about the discrimination? Fat chance that will happen.\n \n \nI was wondering how long you would allow my misleading claim.\n\n \n You purposely made a misleading claim? I guess myself and others were lazy on one point.\n \n \nThe Netherlands okayed same-sex marriage in 2000. The sanctity of marriage has suffered and out-of-wedlock births are rising because of it. The changes in their laws have undermined the sanctity of marriage, just as they will in all other countries that follow.\n \n http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDFhMjk0YjI4NzgyZGM4NjMxZmY4NTQwZWNjYzkzYjg=\n\n \n It appears those trends were happening before same-sex marriage was legal. It's bogus to blame it on same-sex marriage.\n \n \nThere's no need to pursue this.\n\n \n I've already forgotten what is was about.\n \n \nI'm relatively certain you and others will misinterpret the following, but I'm saying it anyway: In the battle between Good and Evil, should Good concede and accept the ways of Evil?\n\n \n No.\n \n \nMarriage was constructed as a bonding between a man and a woman. Why should that be changed?\n\n \n Because it is discrimination, and we are constructing our society to be more accepting of gays.\n \n \nGood luck on gaining respect through law.\n\n \n In Canada, where I am, acceptance of gay marriage has increased since legalization of equal marriage for same-sex couples.\n \n \nSuch a noble goal!\n\n \n Thank you. That's what we want in ending exclusion discimination and bias, we want to harm religion.",

This is not a judgement of who is better than whom, just as lowering the bar for graduation in the No Child Left Behind program is not a judgement of whose children are better than which others. It has nothing to do with the relative quality of the two parties being 'equalized' as you say. And the children are still unequal. You just have dumb children and smart children graduating...it's just that the bar has been lowered. The diploma means a bit less to the smart children....just as the word 'married' will mean less to those currently described by it if you lower the bar to admit gays.\n \n It was not meant to imply that I think straights are better than gays and you erred in inferring so.\n \n The reference I made was to a possible 'suggestion' that straights are better. There may be a suggestion in your mind that married couples are better than gay couples. I suspect that by the tenacity of those who desire to 'join the club'. There may also be a suggestion (again, in your own mind) that married couples think they are better than gay couples and you want to remove this suggestion.\n \n My colors are visible at all times.

There are many gay people, maybe most, who do not go to parades and gay clubs. They want to be part of the mainstream. Others would like to stand out. Opponents complain that gays define themsleves separately from everyone based on their sexuality, that gays place too much emphasis on their separate sexual identity. Jyoshu has said on past threads that sexuality shouldn't be such a big part of someone's life that it is identity. Now he would like us to be defined by our sexual identities under a separate proud banner.\n \n I remember reading several years ago, at the height of debate here in Canada, about a lesbian in Quebec.
