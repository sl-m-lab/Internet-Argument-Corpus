   "ST. LOUIS (CNS) -- Four suspended priests of the St. Louis Archdiocese have been dismissed from the priesthood, Archbishop Raymond L. Burke announced. The Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has laicized -- or permanently dismissed from the clerical state -- James A. Funke, James L. Gummersbach, Bryan M. Kuchar and Michael L. Seidel. \n \n All four men had what were determined to be credible allegations of sexual abuse of a minor against them. Their priestly faculties had been suspended by the archdiocese and they were forbidden to function or represent themselves as priests. A Nov. 3 statement from the archdiocese noted that Archbishop Burke, after a careful examination of the allegations against the men, asked that the proceedings be undertaken to return the men to the lay state. \n \n Dismissal from the clerical state, which is given with the approval of the pope, means that a priest is dispensed from all obligations that he assumed by way of sacred orders and that the archdiocese no longer has responsibility for his support.\n \n \n \n \n \n I Am pleased that the vatican has acted in this manor, I hope the vatican investigations continue and the priesthood is purified from those priests responsible... It is a good step in the right direction.",
